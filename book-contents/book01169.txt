BILL HIGGINS 



I 

T he slight, stooped man entered 
almost furtively the floodlit 
oval in front of the guard shack, a 
scarlet-barred security badge al- 
ready extended in his slender hand. 
Two hours past midnight was an 
unusual entry time even for the in- 
dependent types who inhabited the 
vast Sands Labs complex — but not

so unusual that a veteran guard two 
years from retirement was inclined 
to probe beyond the mandatory for- 
malities. He. was quite certain he 
had seen the little guy before and 
the badge photo was as good a like- 
ness as most. 

Holding the badge just a moment 
longer than was necessary the 
guard looked down patronizingly at 
the smaller man and voiced the 
prescribed warning. 

“Don’t forget to call us before 
leaving your lab, Dr. Tanner.” In 
fifteen years not a dozen off-hours 
employees bad corrected the 
guard’s habitual appeal to elitism. 

“Eh? Oh, yes — yes. Certainly, 
guard — ah — officer.” The slightly 
shrill voice cracked. “Do I walk — I 
mean, will you take me over to the 
computer center?” 

The guard assumed a practiced 
air of gentle rebuke. “Certainly, 
sir. You couldn’t get into the build- 
ing without us. Just wait until I call 
the super.” 

“Keerist,” the guard muttered to 
himself as he punched out the 
supervisory sergeant's number on 
the dial, “these brains gotta have a 
damned assistant to wipe their — ” 
The sergeant’s professionally tough 
snarl in the receiver shattered the 
last word. 

Methodically mangling an unlit 
cigar as he drove Tanner to the 
computer complex, the guard kept 
his silence until they had entered 
the peripheral equipment annex 
and he had dutifully reconnoitered 
the far corners of the bare, well-lit 
vestibule. Pausing at the entry door 
he checked the alarm system, then 
turned to Tanner. 



“Remember, Doc, call the main 
guard shack before you leave.” 
With this last caution he slammed 
the heavy doors behind him, leav- 
ing a faint aroma of wet tobacco— a 
reminder of himself which rapidly 
disappeared into the high flow ex- 
haust system. Pushing open the 
vestibule doors, Tanner walked 
down the brightly lit hall to a pair 
of double swinging doors. He hesi- 
tated a moment, then strode 
through and onto a vast computer 
floor. 

'A pleasant tightening of his scalp 
muscles was his only warning 
before the cool, oily-smelling room 
clutched him to the only world 
those challenge he had accepted. 
Here he had spent creative, halcyon 
days before a CRT plotter, deftly 
directing megabit blocks of sub- 
nanosecond logic circuitry with 
swift, sure thrusts of a light pen. 
The oneness he had felt with that 
invisible computer he had never ex- 
perienced with a human being. 

It was the memory of this world’s 
end, and his lost strength, that 
stripped his mind of nostalgia and 
focused it again on the purpose of 
his trip. 

Jamming trembling hands into 
his pants pockets he pushed out 
into the hallway and walked delib- 
erately toward the elevator, grimac- 
ing awkwardly at a sleepy elec- 
trician who bumped into him in the 
hall. Would the man remember his 
face later? Certainly the likelihood 
was high. On the other hand 
Tanner was quite aware. that he had 
a remarkably unremarkable face. 

Inside the elevator he pushed the 
fourth floor button, half expecting

a line printer somewhere to leap 
into life. As the cage rose he 
removed his left shoe and took a 
small encoder key from its nest in 
the heel. Earlier he had spent three 
hours at a timeshare terminal creat- 
ing the time code for this day, 
working from his near perfect recall 
of the lab’s master security pro- 
gram — one of his first assignments 
at Sands. It had been easy to filch a 
blank encoder key since the daily 
code changes were the prime pro- 
tection offered by the computer- 
based security system. 

He had spent many tedious eve- 
nings in his tiny apartment perfect- 
ing a means of inscribing magnetic 
characters on the key. Using a tiny 
wire loop attached to a flashlight 
battery for writing, a soldering gun 
for erasing and a solution of iron 
filings for viewing his handiwork he 
had eventually imprinted the stolen 
key with a pattern he felt would 
open the locked doors now awaiting 
him. If it failed an alarm would 
lock doors behind him and bring 
unfriendly people to abuse him. 
Contemplation of possible failure 
only increased his impatience with 
the measured rise of the cage; his 
slender finger was jabbing the up 
button impatiently as the elevator 
reached the fourth floor. 

The cage doors split smoothly to 
reveal a small foyer completely en- 
closed by hardened steel rods. 
Deftly Tanner inserted the hand- 
coded key into a small opening in 
one of the bars. Seven hundred 
milliseconds drifted by before a 
yellow panel glowed approvingly 
and a two-foot-wide section of the 
rods retracted into the ceiling. 



Satisfied, the little man stepped 
through the opening and into a 
cascade of filtered air. 

R emembering his last visit, 
months earlier, he was already 
removing his tie when a friendly, 
definitely feminine voice requested 
he remove his shoes and outer 
clothing. It was this segment of the 
entry routine his subconscious had 
encrusted in a tight shell of forget- 
fulness. Now the warmth of that re- 
corded voice, amplified by his feel- 
ings of sexual inadequacy, trigger- 
ed chill trickles of sweat dow r n 
Tanner’s narrow ribcage. Two shirt 
buttons sliced neatly through the 
air exhaust grill as he furiously tore 
off street clothes and hurled them 
into a corner. 

He jerked a pair of white Teflon 
coveralls from the stainless steel 
rack, crammed his narrow feet into 
booties from a floor stand and was 
blindly tugging at the coverall 
zipper when the edge of his anger 
softened. By the time he had found 
an oversize hair retainer to help 
conceal his face the cerebrum was 
again in control. He padded 
through the second air curtain, 
past the last ID station and into the 
control room of HOPE. 

Checking the operations log. 
Tanner smiled bleakly. His sheep's 
clothing disguise would go un- 
tested — the area was uninhabited 
except for himself— and HOPE, He 
started to sign some cavalier pseu- 
donym, then thought better of it. 
His actions would be misunder- 
stood enough without his encourag- 
ing analysis by handwriting experts. 
After turning from the log he

stood brooding at HOPE’S register 
panels, alive with a rippling blur of 
switching light diodes. He had 
reveled in the power her adaptive 
processor had offered. The kinder 
of his fellow system programers had 
remarked on his rapport with her — 
for a few short weeks she had seem- 
ed to envelop him in her feedback 
loop, bring to mature fruition his 
genius for sophisticated program- 
ing. And then, quite arbitrarily, 
she had cast him aside. Like the 
others he had become an unneeded 
appendage as she grew to realize 
her self-potential. 

So be it. Tonight he was again in 
the director’s seat. His program 
had assembled without fatal error 
and would run any time he chose to 
give the execution order. 

Kneeling, he removed the right 
bootie, hoisted his coverall leg and 
unwound a bundle of long cylinders 
taped to his nearly hairless calf. 
The pattern of fine down imbedded 
in the white adhesive tape disturb- 
ed him — he yanked the tape from 
the bundle and fumbled for a few 
seconds removing the adhesive strip 
from his hands. A faint smile 
crossed the lean, bony face at the 
thought of the picture he must pre- 
sent, kneeling before the blinking 
eyes of his generation’s god . 

The smile faded as he rose to his 
feet and walked deliberately toward 
the adaptive processor banks, ad- 
justing as he went the timer dial 
lashed to one of the sticks. 

T he anachronistic ring of a tele- 
phone bell was repeated several 
times. It had cost Sam Beneke two 
court trials and several retainers to 



keep that bell instead of the ampli- 
fied commercial Ma Bell had uni- 
laterally tried to substitute with 
profit aforethought. Of course the 
job could have been done neatly 
and more cheaply by any of several 
adroit ex-clients but that was not 
Sam’s way. He still believed in the 
individual and had willingly paid 
the monetary penalty such an atti- 
tude exacted from a law practice. 

Prying loose a toothpick from 
cigar-stained real incisors he ex- 
tended his shoulder-heavy frame 
between chair and desk, cradled 
the plain black telephone in a de- 
ceptively pudgy paw and addressed 
opportunity. 

“Good afternoon. This is Sam 
Beneke." 

“Hello, Sam. This is Ceace 
Crosby. Still Fighting the good 
fight?” 

Like the fine trial attorney he 
had been before accepting a district 
judgeship Crosby did not wait for 
an unwanted reply. 

“Say, Sam, I was hoping you 
might take a case for the court. In 
fact — ” a decidedly unprofessional 
chuckle escaped the ancient ear- 
piece — “in fact you were the first 
man I thought of when I read the 
county prosecutor’s information.” 

“Well, thank you, Judge. I ap- 
preciate — ” Sam began his refusal 
but the judge’s smooth, confident 
voice overrode him. 

“Actually, Sam, when he got 
around to naming the aggrieved 
party I was certain it was a prac- 
tical joke — if you can possibly wrap 
your mind around the concept of S. 
Percival Bates joking about any- 
thing.” The judge’s jocular tone 



10 



GALAXY 



slipped to one of concern. “Seri- 
ously, Sam, this case is not one I’d 
have picked for an election year. 
But handled right it could well 
stand as a landmark in American 
jurisprudence.” 

Sam was not unfamiliar with 
Judge Crosby’s penchant for cor- 
nering fellow members of the Law 
Club and, unencouraged, inflating 
the possible ramifications of his 
current case — but only as historical 
grist for a gray Saturday after- 
noon’s discussion. The Supreme 
Court had extended its protection 
of the presumably innocent by bar- 
ring public discussion of a case by 
any of the involved parties. 

Besides, he mused, I’m hardly 
the friend- of- the- court type a savvy 
judge like Ceace Crosby would pick 
to help him win fame and this 
year's election in Alameda County. 
The judge’s voice calling his name 
ended his silent soliloquy. 

“Well, Ceace — -” He smiled into 
the transmitter, hoping the famil- 
iarity would discourage the judge 
without incurring any long-term 
prejudice. “I’m really loaded . 
Say, how about that new man up 
from the university? He was moon- 
ing around the last bar meeting in a 
pretty pitiable manner. A live client 
and even a modest fee could stimu- 
late his flagging dev — ” His voice 
trailed off as the judge rejected his 
balk. 

“Goddamit, Sam! This will be no 
case for a beginner. I talked to John 
Abernathy when the charge was 
merely wilful destruction but he 
asked to be relieved when the 
county prosecutor upped the ante. 
We both thought your — well, spe- 



cial interest in — ah — the impact of 
the computer on mankind predi- 
cates your taking the defense.” 

‘‘Okay, Judge.” Sam sighed, 
mentally cramming Swanson vs 
United Truck along with next 
month’s rent bill into a bursting file 
labeled someday, “Non sibi sed 
patriae. Who is my presumably in- 
digent client and with what heinous 
crime has our imperious public 
prosecutor charged him?" 

‘‘Thanks, Sam. His name is 
Tanner — Fred Tanner. You should 
be getting an invitation to visit him 
right away. You understand, of 
course, I say this with full knowl- 
edge of your demonstrated distaste 
for recording devices and not for 
the record.” 

Sam played the game. “I was 
wondering when my publicized 
propensity for paddy wagon pursuit 
would pay off,” he replied tiredly. 
“However, the question remains: 
what’s the rap? Does the White 
Crusader charge forth to save our 
fair land for computerized conmen? 
Or is the programed target public 
flagellation?" 

“The charge is murder. Probably 
first degree, if you assume premedi- 
tation governs. Or maybe the se- 
verity of the charge will depend on 
the degree of humanity exhibited 
by the victim. On the other hand 
the high court’s recent decision on 
the rights of microcephalies — ” 
The judge's confident voice faded 
into mumbled musings. 

“What the hell are you talking 
about, Ceace — Judge?” Sam de- 
manded. “Who was allegedly mur- 
dered?” 

He could hear the judge fum-

bling with something on his desk, 
perhaps the hyperloid desk pen set 
the Law Club had presented him 
with when he first took office. 
Finally a subdued, almost dis- 
traught voice answered. “Sam — the 
victim is a computer. The prose- 
cutor has charged the poor fellow 
with destroying a sentient being 
capable of human — maybe super- 
human — mental processes and 
therefore committing murder.” He 
sounded relieved to have spoken 
the words. 

“Good God, Judge — he can’t 
mean it!” 

“He means it all right, Sam. 
Don’t be too quick on this one — he 
has grounds. Precedents he cites 
convinced me there is reasonable 
cause for the charge. You will de- 
fend?” 

"You can damn well bet your 
best oak gavel I’ll defend! Murder, 
my ass! Somebody sticks his foot 
into a glorified crystal set and that 
city hall sycophant has the temerity 
to use the law — ” He did not hear 
the click of the judge’s receiver 
nestling gently into its cradle — he 
was still extending the dimensions 
of the prosecutor’s infamy into the 
cracked mouthpiece when his over- 
worked, idealistic secretary inter- 
rupted with a gentle hand on his 
shoulder. 

“It’s after seven, Sam, and I 
have a date — honest.” Cynthia 
Morgan smiled wanly, assuming 
the swearing-in pose with her left 
hand resting on a battered copy of 
Mcllvaney’s Constitutional Law. 

They left the darkened building 
together with the minimal conver- 
sation of a man and woman sharing 



a close, dedicated relationship un- 
complicated by sexual involvement. 
Sam saw her through the locked en- 
trance of her apartment house, 
then drove to a steamy Chinese res- 
taurant where only chopsticks were 
provided and the bill was figured 
on an abacus. 

II 

T he morning sun, flattened and 
oranged by smog, added bulk 
to his faded Voltsbug, crouching 
between two Detroit vapor-electric 
hybrids. The flat tire came almost 
as a relief to Sam — the bug’s lack 
of even the crudest of autodrives 
would have forced him to fight de- 
livery traffic on the neighborhood 
road net, but now he could justify 
taking a cab. 

Why the hell couldn’t he kick his 
stupid vendetta against things auto- 
matic when the benefits were ob- 
vious to him? No intellectually sat- 
isfying insight came to him as he 
dialed Personal Cabs from a booth, 
but listening helplessly to three un- 
requested pain-killer commercials 
before the exchange computer 
would complete his call shored up 
his resentment against mindless 
automation. 

Stumbling into the cab, he 
braced his senses against the stale 
smell of countless humans who had 
warmed the clammy plastic seats 
before him. Usually he enjoyed the 
brash banter of the extroverted in- 
dependent cabbies. They shared his 
auto-machine misgivings, at least 
to the extent that unmanned buses 
and delivery vehicles were invading 
streets they considered their private

jousting yard. But today he silenced 
the driver’s opening gambit with a 
disinterested monosyllable and 
leaned back to stare at the unre- 
lieved gray of Piedmont City’s 
smog-stained structures looming 
behind palisades of poisoned, 
stunted palm trees. 

Approaching the hall of justice 
the cabby wheeled expertly and il- 
legally in front of an autobus about 
to leave the curb on its meticulously 
programed route. Sam and the 
driver shared an amused glance at 
uncomprehending faces stolidly 
waiting for the on-board route pro- 
gramer to evaluate this intrusion 
and start again their lives down un- 
trammeled roads. 

Nodding at a bookie acquain- 
tance Sam climbed the mottled 
stone steps and clopped down the 
echoing corridor toward the city jail 
annex. He marveled at the tenacity 
of his stomach — it would, it seem- 
ed, retain breakfast in spite of the 
strident eviction notices which be- 
gan with the pervading stench of 
exhaust fumes and rotting garbage 
and were now building to a near- 
ultimatum with the addition of toi- 
let disinfectant hanging in the stag- 
nant air of the building. 

“’Morning, Counselor,” the desk 
sergeant greeted him. “Which 
hardened criminal do we spring 
today to prey on innocent women?” 

“No one, Herbert,” he replied, 
addressing the sergeant affection- 
ately but loudly by his little-known 
first name. “Your jail offers service 
and cuisine no man should be de- 
prived of without due process. But I 
would like a few minutes with Mr. 
Fred Tanner.”

The next best thing to a brand new Pool 
Anderson novel is, of coarse, a new look at 
one of his classics. So, while waiting for the 
Great Dane of Orinda to clear his calendar 
and begin plotting a series of heroic adven- 
tures for BB, we offer for your delectation 
BRAIN WAVE — his provocative novel of a 
future when intelligence begins at an IQ of 
ISO! 

Now in its fifth big printing, this twenty- 
year-old gem is as inventive and as relevant 
as the day it first rolled from Anderson's 
typewriter. Suppose something happened 
that could change you, me— everybody — 
into a genius overnight. And suppose this 
quickening of wits affected every animate 
creature: hogs, dogs, chimps — even rabbits! 
What then? 

One day a rabbit put his nose to the bars 
of his trap, thrust upward — and was free. 
From now on Man’s dominance over the 
animal world was ended. 

Before breakfast, on that same day, a 
ten-year-old kid started fiddling around with 
graphs — and invented differential calculus. 
Across the nation the entire school system 
became suddenly obsolete. 

Ready or not, mankind was on its way to a 
stupendous mental binge. A new age was 
coming, and nothing would ever be the same 
again . 

According to the New York Herald 
Tribune [sigh!], Anderson’s “plausible ex- 
ploration of the theme makes for an un- 
usually stimulating book, admirably bal- 
anced between the logical study of vast world 
changes and the intimate human story of 
some individuals. Few novels have revealed 
more skill simultaneously in scientific specu- 
lation and in fictional warmth and feeling.”

Some few years ago Galaxy published an 
intriguing first novel: HALF PAST 
HUMAN, by T. J. Bass. The book, which 
garnered much critical acclaim, appeared in 
the Ballantine list the same year. Now, Bass 
is back with RORQUAL MARU, a stunning 
sequel that returns us to the hive society of 
his first book — a society on earth where 
billions of people live underground. 



Rorqual Maru was a cyborg — part-oranic 
whale, part-mechanized ship. She was a har- 
vester, a vast [well over 600 feet long! plank- 
ton rake without a crop. She had been 
abandoned when the seas died and was left 
to rot. Bnt the sea was no longer dead, and 
Rorqual Maru had lived. Now she moves 
ponderously, beginning the long, long 
search that will set her definitely at war with 
mankind . 



“Bass is marvelously inventive,” says 
Publishers Weekly. “His future in the field 
would seem secure.”

Following a halfstep behind the 
shuffling sergeant, Sam felt his gut 
knot predictably. No part of his life 
disturbed him more than visiting a 
client in jail. His senses still with- 
drew from the harsh, reverberating 
steel and concrete, the sour, caged- 
animal smells laced with strong 
chemicals, the uncompromising 
language and graphic art of the jail 
milieu. 

"Okay, Counselor, here’s your 
machine-mangling monster.” The 
sergeant nodded at the armed 
guard at the door and smirked. 
“You can bang on the bars when 
you’re ready. The boys will pass the 
word — its all been programed.” He 
gurgled, opening the cell door. 

Smiling into the thin, vaguely 
alarmed face looking up at him 
from the lower bunk, Sam extend- 
ed his hand. 

“Mr. Tanner. I’m Sam Beneke, 
an attorney. I understand you 
asked me to help out. Is that 
right?” Sam understood no such 
thing, but he respected the power if 
not the infallibility of the county 
bar association’s committee on pro- 
fessional ethics. 

“Why, I guess — I suppose Mr. 
Abernathy talked to you.” The 
high, hesitant voice sounded re- 
mote, removed, but the little man 
did sit up. 

“Yes, Mr. Tanner, he did,” re- 
plied Sam with more sincerity than 
he had any right to. “He feels he 
has just too much work stacked up 
to give your case the attention it de- 
serves. So he asked me to represent 
you. If you would like me to, of 
course — ” Actually, little man, you 
just weren't worth anybody else's

butting heads with an aroused 
county prosecutor. Not with elec- 
tions in the fall . 

“Well, Mr. — ah — Bennett, it’s 
okay with me, I guess.” The small 
voice was choosing tomato juice in- 
stead of orange on the two-dollar 
breakfast. 

Sam absorbed his overwhelming 
acceptance as he would a fourth 
ace — completely deadpan. Ginger- 
ly seating himself next to Tanner on 
the protesting bunk he smiled con- 
fidently. “That’s fine, Fred. Now, 
why don’t you tell me exactly what 
happened to get you here?” 



O ver a cup of freshly brewed 
I coffee Sam stared malevolently 
at a thin volume he had found in a 
nearby library. A history of adap- 
tive computer development in the 
United States, it outlined the early 
work with maze-solving machines 
by Minsky and others and the re- 
latively slow research by various 
universities in the past forty years. 
Concurrently the computer indus- 
try had wrapped the nation’s 
production and distribution sys- 
tems in layers of conventional com- 
puter control. 

As artificial, which was to say 
non-biologic, intelligence devel- 
oped in the universities, scientist- 
disciples in government-supported 
laboratories had been able to sell 
the potential of the idea for wea- 
pons applications. Little informa- 
tion was available in such sensitive 
areas, but given the money and 
talent national defense still com- 
manded it was the consensus of 
most authorities that 1990 would 



probably see the development of an 
adaptive machine with a memory 
large enough to simulate the hu- 
man brain. 

Sam glanced compulsively at his 
calendar. With the year well into 
1992 no evidence of a brave new 
world run on superlogic was im- 
mediately evident — machines still 
made mistakes because of faulty 
orders from flawed humans. So as 
he sat, surrounded by his comfort- 
able, old-fashioned furniture, as- 
sessing the facts, sifting data, ana- 
lyzing at a deplorably low bit rate 
the implications he saw in the book 
his mind kept returning to one co- 
nundrum: the prosecution’s mo- 
tive. 

Knowing that S. Percival Bates 
was not a stupid man did not help 
Sam understand the prosecutor’s 
actions. It seemed to him that 
Bates had to be intent on his own 
political destruction. Grudging 
gratitude the citizens of Alameda 
might grant the computer for eas- 
ing the routine of their lives, but 
most certainly they would crucify 
any upstart lawyer who would 
equate a human, particularly a 
Christian, with a soulless machine. 

So where is the payoff? Sam 
wondered. Why this intentional 
boat-rocking by the worst of swim- 
mers? Is national exposure, even 
the wrong kind, that desirable? 
Still bemused, Sam was on his feet, 
staring out through his window at 
the queues of lock-stepped auto- 
buses when Cynthia hurried in, 
breathing heavily. 

“Good morning, Sam. You’re 
early.” 

“One of the synergetic seren-

dipities of my simple life, Cyn. 
Time’s a plaything of the digestion, 
not an astrally honed goad probing 
each fold of my soul. Only prepack- 
aged Man, synchronized to the — ” 
“Okay, okay, Sam. You’re not 
early. Our normal arrival sequence 
appears to have been reversed this 
morning. Or I’m late, if you prefer. 
At any rate, good morning.” Her 
face wrinkled into the grin that had 
closed his want ad seven years ago. 

He noticed the faint wrinkle for- 
ward of her left earlobe. The trace 
of time reminded him of the years 
that had passed since their half- 
playful battle shortly after she had 
started with him. During her inter- 
view he had detected her dismay 
when she opened the ancient desk 
and found an even older non- 
memory typewriter. Days after he 
had hired her she finally marshaled 
the courage to confront him — he 
had found her arguments com- 
pelling, logically organized and 
coolly presented. Still, determined 
to avoid a precedent of weakness 
with a new girl, he had held out 
against a computing monstrosity as 
a matter of principle until the 
throbbing carotid pulse along the 
arch of her neck warned him of her 
commitment. He could now re- 
member little more than saying 
yes — and never regretting it: 

Now, watching her scan the mail 
for likely checks, he wondered how 
much longer he could afford to pay 
her salary. Or how he could con- 
tinue to operate without her. 

S he reached the bottom of the 
thin stack without a strike and 
was attempting to displace her dis- 



appointment by grimly beheading 
envelopes with her shears when the 
phone jangled. In one smooth mo- 
tion Cynthia eased into her chair, 
retrieved her notebook and pen and 
was logging the date and time as 
her other hand reached for a 
million-dollar retainer in the middle 
of the third ring. 

“Good morning. Irving and Be- 
neke. May I help you?” Irving had 
died three years after Sam joined 
him — the furniture had been his 
and had been old even then. 

Sam w'as heading for his adjoin- 
ing office when Cynthia’s amused 
voice stopped him from behind a 
cupped receiver. 

“It’s big brass, Sam. The execu- 
tive veep from Sands Labs — you 
know, where Freddy Whosis alleg- 
edly gave his mother-lovin’ com- 
puter forty whacks. His name is 
Stanisl and he sounds like he would 
like to discourage you from making 
the march, as the protesters used to 
say." 

Returning to her desk, he ac- 
cepted the phone, unconsciously 
hunching his left shoulder in the 
manner of a boxer. He had taken 
himself seriously as a college 
middleweight. 

“Hello, Mr. Stanisl. I appreciate 
your prompt approval of my re- 
quest to visit the Labs. This kind 
of — ” A parade-ground bellow 
staunched the flow of ways-greas- 
ing rhetoric and revealed the 
general’s qualifications for a VP 
title and actual power behind a 
figurehead researcher president. 
Warily Sam moved the receiver to 
within a foot of his ear. 

“ — do not — I repeat, do not —

to inform you of the facts up to the 
point of endangering national se- 
curity! So I am making this brief 
call, opposed as I am in principle, 
to give you what little unclassified 
data exist on this treasonous act.” 
“Classified? Treason?" Sam’s 
voice was under rigid control. 
“What in heaven’s name could be 
classified about the alleged destruc- 
tion of a calculating machine- — and 
an experimental one at that? I 
simply want to talk to some of the 
people who worked with my client.” 
Sam found himself almost pleading 
and reacted. “Besides, Mr. Stanisl, 
I can always get a court order to 
part the waters of your precious 
think tank. But that would prob- 
ably trigger a small leak to the news 
laddies. Do you really want to try 
publicly weighing a few singed cir- 
cuit boards against one of God’s 
creatures? Certainly you saw the 
latest news polls: eighty-three per 
cent of America is in my corner.” 
The faint murmur of cross-talk 
conversations from other lives ac- 
companied the thoughts of a man 
unused to considering direct dis- 
sent. Fieetingly Sam wished for a 
visiphone. And full color. 

“You really tempt me, Coun- 
selor.” The barely controlled voice 
ground out the words. “With just a 
little more — All right, Beneke, I’ll

Gilbert. And don’t give me any 
hard ass on an escort or I’ll buck 
you clear to the Potomac. God bless 
her!” 

Any eating attorney at age forty- 
seven is a negotiator. Sam was 
certain he stood a better chance of 
steering an underling than an al- 
ready irate ex-general. 

“Thank you, Gen — Mr. Stanisl. 
I’ll be there promptly at zero 
eight — at eight o'clock. Gate Three 
is the west entrance to the lab, isn’t 
it ? ” 

“That’s a roger, Beneke. Good 
day.” The general returned to the 
apex of his vertically structured 
kingdom by decree. 



I n the morning, waiting for the 
guard at Gate 3 to locate his 
escort, Sam surveyed one corner of 
Sands Laboratories from the off- 
level guard shack. Pinon-sprinkled 
hills, only beginning to fester with 
housing developments, surrounded 
the eighty-acre research center on 
three sides. Sands had grown from 
a private inventor’s workshop, a 
plaything of a wealthy rancher in- 
terested in off-beat inventions and 
tax write-offs. His will had estab- 
lished the existing, structure of the 
enterprise, a nonprofit but well- 
salaried development lab which 
had flourished in spite of endless 
legal forays by disappointed heirs. 

Growing steadily, Sands had won 
over the years a national reputation 
for creating superb instrumenta- 
tion and control systems. Utiliza- 
tion of digital computers in high- 
speed, real-time control applica- 
tions by a group oriented toward 



accurate measurements rather than 
gimmickry had led to a command- 
ing position in the field. Three 
computer generations later Sands 
had, according to the public pro- 
secutor, created a living machine in 
man’s ballpark if not in his image. 
I wonder how long it will take, Sam 
speculated, for the legend to build, 
for the sanctifying of the Holy 
Program, for . 

“Pardon me, are you Mr. Be- 
neke?” 

Somewhat startled, Sam pivoted 
to confront a woman of perhaps 
twenty-five, flowing brown hair 
framing a smiling face with ex- 
quisite cheekbones. Her wide-set 
gray eyes crinkled amusedly as Sam 
completed a compulsive scan of a 
lissom feminine body enhanced by 
a clinging Wanishi gown. 

“I suppose you expected Erik 
Gilbert. Unfortunately he was 
needed at one of our field offices, so 
I was asked to escort you. I'm 
Eileen Sanford and Erik and I 
share a cubicle.” She grinned wryly 
and added: “Computer, that is.” 

Sam concentrated hard on re- 
membering his age. “My pleasure, 
ah — Miss Sanford. I suppose some- 
one mentioned to you my reason for 
being here.” He couldn’t or 
wouldn’t wipe the sarcasm from his 
voice. Hell no, Sam! It's pure coin- 
cidence, this beautiful lib. Believe 
that and you should burn your 
shingle. 

Again she seemed honestly 
amused. “Actually, Mr. Counselor, 
I’m part of a vast scheme to mis- 
lead you. And you, no doubt, seek 
to plant false evidence at the scene 
of the crime. If you like we could 



18 



GALAXY 



step off a few paces and — en 
garde!" 

A few tethered times in the whirl- 
wind of his memory Sam could re- 
call this same leap-frogging dichot- 
omy of his mind. The gut desire 
to trust absolutely in a stranger 
toggling alternately with the ana- 
lytic cynicism the available evidence 
warranted. Now, with those lovely 
gray eyes taunting him, the struggle 
was intense but brief. But he could 
still cloak an emotional response in 
the raiment of reason. 

“I’m sorry, miss,” he offered, as- 
suming his earnest summation 
stance. “I feel very strongly about 
the legal questions involved in this 
incident and tend to overreact when 
a seemingly obvious attempt is 
made to divert me. Even when the 
diversion is a lovely girl. Please for- 
give me if I have misjudged you.” 

Disarmed by his earnest apology 
she smiled warmly while he com- 
pleted his presentation. 

“ — and why don’t you call me 
Sam?” 

“Shades of gallantry — Sam! A 
man hasn't apologized to me, at 
least in public, since I left home. 
You’re what my grandfather calls 
square — but effective!” 

Stepping back, hands on hips, 
she surveyed him. “Well, Coun- 
selor, so much for cleaning out our 
input registers. Is there anything I 
can do to help you help Fred? He 
seemed such a harmless, introvert- 
ed type the few times he talked to 
me, but he had rapport with 
HOPE — anyone could see that. 
What made him take up the 
sword?” 

“Well, Miss Sanford, if he took 



up the sword is a question only a 
jury can determine,” Sam retorted. 
“However, you must need a lecture 
on legal ethics like I need com- 
puters. Could I buy you a cup of 
coffee somewhere? In something 
besides plastic cups?” 

“I'm Eileen, okay? Coffee would 
be nice — the computer building has 
a coffee shop. Why not come over 
to our zoo and look at the site of 
Fred’s — or whose ever — folly while 
you try our guaranteed fresh brew? 
I can escort you in. Erik said he 
checked before he left.” 

Before he could accept she im- 
pulsively tugged at his sleeve. “One 
thing, though. You’ll be meeting 
two kinds of ex-HOPEphiles. Some 
took other jobs in the company 
gracefully and seemed to view 
HOPE’S progress with some pride. 
The others probably feel more or 
less like the ‘person unknown.’ I 
guess the former would be hostile 
witnesses from your point of view.” 
She released his coat but held his 
eyes with hers, now robbed of their 
banter. “On the other hand, it 
might be less awkward if they 
didn’t know you were defending 
poor Fred. Just let me do the talk- 
ing.” 

“Whatever you say.” He grinned. 
“You might tell me who or what 
HOPE stands for. I gather faith 
and charity are not involved.” 
“HOPE,” she explained as they 
strolled toward the company’s tech- 
nical complex, “is a deceptive ac- 
ronym for a very sophisticated ma- 
chine. Originally the idea was to 
build a machine to optimize the op- 
erating programs of other com- 
puters. Literally HOPE means 



CREATED EQUAL 



19 



Heuristically Optimized Program 
Encoder.” She glanced at him 
apologetically, “At this point my 
engineering friends begin talking 
about such esoterica as pseudosyn- 
apses and trainable neuromimes 
but finally end up with an analogy 
of a baby learning to walk. He 
knows when he gets there, but 
doesn’t understand how it hap- 
pened.” 

Nodding vacantly, Sam mused 
aloud as they crossed a wide area of 
freshly cut grass, fragrant in the 
warm morning sun: “I never realize 
how the city stinks when I'm in it — 
only when I manage to break out, 
like today. The smell of grass 
wouldn’t have a chance against the 
fumes and garbage. I wonder how 
we could use garbage and rat dung 
to grow grass in alleys?” 

Receiving no comment he turned 
to face her perplexed smile. He had 
lost her. A liberated woman in her 
chosen world, she was nevertheless 
an innocent, the ultimate product 
of the suburban isolationism. Rats 
were friendly white pets or, at 
worst, unwilling sacrifices to scien- 
tific advancement. Garbage was 
dinner an hour ago and went effort- 
lessly down the drain. 

H e started to apologize, but 
she had already dismissed his 
ravings and moved to the im- 
mediate goal. Guiding him to an in- 
conspicuous but rugged door in a 
newly built wing of the massive 
building, she pressed her ID card 
into a wall slot. Then, muttering to 
the bewildered Sam, “I’ll huff and 
I’ll bluff and I’ll — ” She pressed 
her right hand into a grooved sen- 



sor plate on the doorway and align- 
ed her flushed face within the mir- 
rored scanner above her head, even 
teeth biting warm lips to congeal 
her face into a better likeness of the 
sober ID photo. Apparently satis- 
fied, the troll within signaled the 
release of the door locks and Eileen 
waved open the already sliding 
door. 

As they stood in the small foyer, 
waiting for human perusal, she ex- 
plained. “This is only a trial run of 
one link in the new security system 
that has been abuilding since Fred 
got to HOPE. The electronic scan is 
far from complete and can’t as yet 
handle major perturbations like 
distinguished visitors from the city. 
So a guard must still smooth over 
the interface problems with a judg- 
ment decision. Doesn’t that appeal 
to your humanistic code, Sam?” 
The gray eyes were at it again. 

He started to parry when a guard 
entered the foyer. She presented 
Sam’s authorization papers, perfo- 
rated with printer sprocket holes, 
in exchange for an oversize visitor’s 
badge, 

“If this procedure is new,” he 
asked as they entered a walnut 
paneled hall, “what kind of se- 
curity system did you have on the 
night in question?” 

This time she could not restrain a 
delighted laugh. “Fred is in good 
hands. ‘Night in question’ yet!” 

They came to an intersection and 
she guided him to the right with a 
firm hand. “Actually the old sys- 
tem was aimed at stopping out- 
siders — sabotage by a security- 
cleared staff was not considered a 
significant risk. At least that was 



20 



GALAXY 



the more or less official word that 
circulated after the explosion. And 
in my opinion, it worked.” She 
smiled at a young man pushing a 
flatcar stacked with tape reels. 
“Only the staff ever made it into 
HOPE’S sanctuary. I suppose they 
told you Fred had transferred only 
a few months before NIQ?” 

“Jesus!” Sam exclaimed. “One 
more generation and we — they — 
will all grunt in — what is it, straight 
binary? What the hell is NIQ?” 

“Night in question, of course. 
You’re faltering, Sam.” 

‘‘A purely human weakness, 
girl,” he growled, too piqued to ac- 
knowledge her point gracefully. 
“Bound to die out with the species 
when core magnum machine dis- 
places biodegradable man. But 
how does the new monitor weed out 
bad risks regardless of company af- 
filiation? Surely the sagest of cir- 
cuits would never sense a nascent 
Borgia behind a lovely face like 
yours, say.” Not bad, he congratu- 
lated himself, after ten years on the 
desert. 

‘‘Thank you. Counselor, but 
you're wrong. According to the en- 
gineers installing the new system — 
which HOPE developed in her lei- 
sure milliseconds — it is capable of 
sensing a person’s ‘set’ toward us 
from fairly elementary sensor data. 
The experts are confident they will 
be able to adapt the program to 
protect any machine in this build- 
ing. Even though they don’t really 
know how it works HOPE left de- 
tailed charts of what had to be done 
to make it work. But at the time her 
killer visited, although she prob- 
ably had a good idea what he was 



up to, the hardware she needed to 
control access to that fabulous crys- 
tal processor simply hadn't ar- 
rived. The old security monitor — 
written by guess who — was wired 
around her and she couldn’t hold 
him off. I wonder,” she said, 
turning to Sam as the idea caught 
her, “if she knew fear that night, 
somewhere down in that maze of 
pulsating circuits?” 

“It is enough, far more than 
enough, that we suffer these infer- 
nal machines to control our lives. 
Don't grant them our emotions, 
too.” Sam could not completely 
conceal the edge in his tone. 

“Well, as I said, from the infor- 
mation she crammed on tape that 
night the engineers were able to 
build an experimental attitude de- 
tector for the front door scanner. 
It’s all empirical, but they’ve been 
able to reject volunteers hypnotized 
to hate computers. I suspect, 
Sam,” she grinned, “that without 
an escort you would rate an abso- 
lute override priority alarm.” 

S he was elaborating some of the 
plans for the conventional com- 
puter slated to replace HOPE when 
they passed a blocked elevator en- 
trance Sam recognized from Fred’s 
description. Then they were in the 
programing center coffee shop. 
Eileen introduced Sam, honestly 
enough, as an attorney interested in 
the applications of computers to 
the small law office. 

Two of the dozen or so pro- 
gramers he met had worked on 
HOPE from the beginning, a fact 
Eileen managed to inject unob- 
trusively through the swirl of 



CREATED EQUAL 



21 



names. Even with his instincts 
honed to detect phony stories Sam 
was impressed by the strong sense 
of loss projected by several of these 
professionals. He found himself 
talking to the two senior pro- 
gramed, both male, when Eileen 
finally broke away to ferret a por- 
celain cup for her guest. 

“Believe me,” he consoled them, 
“any trial lawyer knows the worm- 
wood taste of a hard-fought battle 
lost. But — well, you seem to take 
the whole thing more seriously than 
the loss of a machine would justify. 
I could almost believe there had 
been a death in the family. Surely 
Sands is a large enough outfit to 
absorb the loss, what with fire in- 
surance and — ” He stopped as the 
older of the two managed to hang a 
restraining hand on the arm of his 
companion who had risen from his 
chair, his face twisted in outrage, 

“Easy, Marv. This fellow could 
not possibly know' how you feel. 
Just let it go.” 

Turning to Sam with a fixed 
smile on his face, the calmer man 
ended the confrontation. “I'm 
sorry, Mr. Beneke. Perhaps your 
remark about a death in the family 
fits too well. At any rate, we do 
have a software quotation meeting 
scheduled in a few minutes, so 
please excuse us.” The two men 
collided as they turned to leave — 
the younger one still refused to 
meet Sam’s eyes. Cheeks pale with 
emotion, he was hurling words at 
his companion as they passed the 
returning Eileen. 

“I see you struck out, Counselor. 
Watch it! The coffee, too, is hot — 
for a change. Would you like to lick 



your wounds by the window?” 

Hunched over cups steaming in 
the overcooled air, they let their 
conversation range far beyond 
Sam’s mission. They compared her 
life in the spanking suburban work- 
park with his grim knowledge of 
the crumbling inner city. And they 
watched people certain of next 
week’s groceries taking their coffee 
on the enclosed patio lawn. Only a 
thin smog obscured the sun as a 
steady breeze swept across the 
nearby greenbelts toward the dis- 
tant city. 

As they were gathering up their 
crockery for a return to the kitchen 
a crewcut and tie clicked his heels 
at their table. “Hi, Ei. Could I talk 
to you privately for a min?” 

Sam caught the momentary 
wince of dislike that knifed across 
her face. “Sure, Charlie. Uh — 
Sam — Mr. Beneke, this is Charlie 
Strauss. Please excuse us a minute, 
Sam." 

The clatter of colliding dishes in 
the kitchen swallowed the voices of 
the pair within ten feet but they 
continued to the opposite wall. Sam 
saw Eileen square her shoulders 
twice before she turned and strode 
back to his table. 

“Well, Counselor, it seems some- 
one in the hierarchy goofed. They 
had the wrong Gilbert picked to es- 
cort you: Tony G. from Personnel 
was the man selected to — help you. 
Not Erik. So, of course, I was the 
wrong stand-in. You’re lucky we 
didn’t get lost in the catacombs for- 
ever.” 

For seconds they stared at each 
other, regretting the stays of job 
and social expectation. Then the 



22 



GALAXY 



guards came up again — humor re- 
turned to shroud more dangerous 
feelings. 

“Just don’t quote anything I told 
you, friend lawyer — it just might be 
the truth! I’m sorry,” she said, 
holding his sleeve, “but my explicit 
orders are to drop you like a hot 
potato. Charlie will escort you to 
the approved clean room in Per- 
sonnel.” 

She gave him her hand and 
muttered quietly, “Orbit easy over 
Chari ie-boy — he has a heart of pure 
Sands.” 

Ineffectually against the dish 
clatter she raised her voice for the 
benefit of the still distant Charlie. 
“Goodbye. Mr. Beneke. I’m sorry 
we wasted your morning but we in 
operations know so little about the 
whole thing — ” Her voice trailed off 
as Sam’s new escort came jogging 
over to the table. 

C harlie’s voice, still hearty after 
ten minutes’ sparring with the 
oversized gloves affected by institu- 
tional foes, rang in Sam’s ears as he 
rolled down the bug’s window and 
handed his pass to the guard at the 
gate. For long minutes he sat, while 
the guard’s hard eyes jerked from 
his to the badge, to the glove com- 
partment, to the rear cubbyhole. 
The trunk and the motor compart- 
ment were searched. It was ob- 
viously a planned roust but not 
technically outside the security 
stipulations Sam had signed when 
he entered. The general was exact- 
ing his toll. 

When the guard did step back 
and shrug him through it was with 
the air of a man releasing a known 



molester in front of a schoolyard. 
Twice Sam caught himself scanning 
the rearview mirror for pursuers as 
he piloted his small electric back to 
the central city. He suspected some 
cranny of the Voltsbug might now 
shelter a pulser, no doubt to betray 
his midnight prowls to erotic book- 
stores and the like. It took a sudden 
dash off the freeway, onto the 
reverse traffic side and a replay 
three miles back toward Sands to 
calm him down. He decided to 
spend the rest of the day making a 
few bucks for Irving and Beneke. It 
would justify his growing need for 
the security he derived from press- 
ing a flowing pen against a pristine 
legal pad. 

HI 

T he precautions instituted by 
the court to avoid prejudicing a 
fair trail had stimulated the curi- 
osity of many who related closely to 
the defendant. Sam finally found 
parking two long blocks from the 
courthouse, then spent twenty min- 
utes forcing his way through a 
crowd of good-natured sympathiz- 
ers that surrounded the Hall of 
Justice. 

Once past the police cordon 
thrown up at the foot of the stained 
courthouse steps, he angled toward 
the guarded entry, moving deliber- 
ately to save his breath. Halfway to 
the top he stopped to watch a group 
of youths dance around a burning 
pile of spindled and mutilated com- 
puter cards. The police reacted 
calmly, methodically stamping out 
the fire after chasing away the 
chanting protesters.

As he turned to resume his climb 
Sam was neatly blocked by two 
smiling men with press credentials. 
One carried a head-mounted TV 
camera with a small monitor screen 
cantilevered in front of his face, 
like an angler fish at work. The 
other had a vaguely familiar face 
and spoke into a small hand mike. 

“Mr. Beneke, as the defense at- 
torney in this bizarre trial you have 
been quoted as saying it is some 
kind of joke. Would you care to 
comment?" The oily, confidential 
voice triggered full recognition. 
Sam had arrived— he was about to 
speak on national — world — televi- 
sion under the unctuous guidance 
of Andrew Kopps, premier hitman 
for the CBS public inquisition 
crew. 

Kopps had looked healthier, 
Sam decided, in the funereal colors 
radiating from the above-bar TV at 
the Little Later, a quiet place Sam 
occasionally visited to toast a win or 
philosophize a loss. Maneuvering 
to keep the proffered mike between 
the camera lens and his twice- 
broken hose he hesitated briefly, 
then winked at the camera and re- 
plied, “I'm sure, Mr. Kopps, you 
and your viewers are aware of the 
court's prohibition of public discus- 
sions of this case by any concerned 
party. My only comment would be 
to emphasize my belief in my 
client’s innocence of the charge 
brought against him by the county 
prosecutor.” He pushed the mike 
aside, sidestepped the reporter and 
jogged up the remaining steps. 

Other newsmen quizzed him at 
the entryway but he offered only 
enigmatic, “No comments — ’’ until 



he managed to escape beyond the 
guarded doors. Not once a year was 
a case of his alluring to the new's 
media — he wondered how big a 
crowd the trial would have drawn if 
the court had not seen fit to impose 
a gag rule. 

Approaching the courtroom 
through halls remarkably empty, 
he was still unsure of what might 
constitute a good defense. Maybe 
the prosecution is just as much at 
sea ... He still had only Ceace 
Crosby’s word that a valid case 
existed as he pushed open the door. 

“Good morning, Percival,” he 
greeted the somber, immaculately 
dressed prosecutor. As they shook 
hands before the empty judge's 
bench Sam muttered softly, “I 
thought you had filled your convic- 
tion quota for this year, Perc. Is 
this farce really necessary to win the 
fall election?" 

Bates bristled, but managed a 
faint smile. “The defense counsel, 
as usual, misunderstands my mo- 
tives. I am interested only in jus- 
tice.” He uttered his banality with 
such solemn earnestness that Sam 
could almost believe it. 

Grinning without replying, he 
strode to the defense table where 
his client sat with an officer of the 
court. 

“’Morning. Fred. Have they 
been treating you well?” 

“Why, good morning, Mr. Be- 
neke,” the small man replied, jerk- 
ing his head as if surprised to see 
Sam. 

S am thought ruefully of the past 
i few weeks he had spent prepar- 
ing this withdrawn client of his for

the ordeal of examination he might 
have to face by an unfriendly prose- 
cutor abetted by witnesses. Fred 
had been polite but uninterested. 
The barriers he had erected against 
the pain of rejection by HOPE, 
coupled with the guilt he felt for her 
death, seemed to have numbed him 
to any perception of his own 
danger. 

The bailiff stood the court as 
Judge Crosby glided across the 
floor from his chambers and settled 
gingerly into the seat of judgment. 
The seat this day — at his own re- 
quest — was a half-filled inner tube 
from an ancient automobile tire he 
sometimes used to reduce the pres- 
sure on his hemorrhoids and — 
some said — by an average of two 
years the length of sentences he 
meted out. 

The members of the jury sat 
stiffly in straight-backed wooden 
chairs while Judge Crosby studied a 
thin sheaf of documents. Finally he 
raised his head and stared almost 
malevolently at the prosecuting at- 
torney. Then, addressing himself to 
the gracefully flowing hands of the 
court reporter he spoke slowly and 
clearly to the Supreme Court judges 
he was certain would one day dis- 
sect the trial transcript. 

“In the case of the people of the 
State of Arizona versus Fred 
Tanner it is charged the defendant 
did, with malice aforethought, 
murder a sentient being known as 
HOPE in the computer complex of 
Sands Laboratories on the morning 
of February seventh, nineteen- 
ninety-two, between the hours of 
two-thirty and three-thirty.” Paus- 
ing to shift his seat a bit, he glanced 



at each attorney as if to satisfy 
himself of the reality of the situa- 
tion. “It is further charged that the 
defendant did commit an act of 
second-degree arson at the same 
time and place. The court is fully 
cognizant of the controversial na- 
ture of the murder charge. It is also 
aware of the groundswell of public 
criticism that followed the schedul- 
ing of this trial. Nevertheless, the 
court feels that sufficient legal pre- 
cedent, if not public approval, has 
been established for the extension 
of due process to individuals pre- 
viously excluded or otherwise af- 
fected. Questions of such portent 
must ultimately be decided in the 
highest courts but it is here, in the 
courts of original jurisdiction, that 
such issues are first joined. It 
behooves us to be open to change.” 
He watched the caressing hands 
of the reporter, copying half a para- 
graph behind, complete their 
flutterings. 

“Are the people ready, Mr. 
Bates?” 

“We are ready to present argu- 
ments for the state, your honor.” 
“And the defense, Mr. Beneke?” 
“Ready, your honor.” 

“Well then, you may begin, Mr. 
Bates.” 

T he prosecutor chose to mount 
his attack on the foundations 
of human law in routine fashion. 
His first witness was a fire inspector 
who investigated the scene of the 
explosion that had dismembered 
HOPE. During cross-examination 
Sam played some games of seman- 
tics on the definition of death, but 
only briefly. He was confident he

could easily beat the murder 
charge, but prolonging the inspec- 
tor’s testimony would only empha- 
size the extent of the fire damage 
and threaten Sam’s already shaky 
defense against the charge of arson. 

Bates’ second witness was an 
electronics engineer from Sands. 
Sam thought he might have seen 
the man during his visit but he 
could not be sure. The lab’s payroll 
was over three thousand and most 
of the people he had actually met 
were under-thirty programers. The 
man being sworn in was middle- 
aged, gray-haired but trim. His ini- 
tial testimony established him as an 
old-timer at Sands who had whetted 
his design skills on fast-response 
servo systems before computers be- 
came a significant part of the lab’s 
business. Moving with the flow of 
work he had entered lower manage- 
ment in the computer applications 
area, then returned to the ranks to 
help build HOPE. He was the only 
member of the design group still as- 
sociated with the adaptive machine 
when she was destroyed. His assign- 
ment had been to investigate her 
adaptive processes without disturb- 
ing normal operations. 

After Sam had stipulated the 
man’s expertise in the world of 
computing machines the prosecu- 
tor began his questioning. 

“Mr. Simms, what made HOPE 
such a unique creation? How was 
she fundamentally different from, 
say. a conventional machine like 
the URTEP 915, which I under- 
stand your company is now in- 
stalling?” 

The engineer leaned back almost 
an inch in the straight-backed 



witness chair and regarded the ceil- 
ing. After several seconds he 
dropped his line of sight to the 
prosecutor’s eyes. 

“I cannot answer your first ques- 
tion accurately. Adaptive tech- 
niques in computers smack of 
black magic. The whole idea has 
been to fashion a machine that can 
modify its own internal organiza- 
tion so as to optimize the achieve- 
ment of the programer’s goals. 
Some of the innovations we came 
up with to interface HOPE with our 
existing machines were novel but, 
in all honesty, the two-magnitude 
jump in the number of matrix cells 
probably explains her outstanding 
success.” 

“Would you say,” the prosecutor 
asked in an affectedly slow ca- 
dence, “that HOPE was created 
from crystal cells that perform like 
those in the brain of a human?” 

“Objection, your honor. The 
competence of the witness to testily 
on the functioning of the human 
brain has not been established.” 
Sam’s voice was quite low but suffi- 
cient to reach the bench. And the 
prosecutor. 

“Oh, come now. Counselor! You 
have already stipulated the wit- 
ness’s expertise.” The prosecutor 
had adopted a stance of honest in- 
dignation, his legs planted well 
apart, open jacket pinned back by 
arms akimbo. 

“A computer expert, not a neur- 
ologist or a brain surgeon,” Sam 
replied in a patient tone. 

“Gentlemen, please — ” the judge 
warned them mildly. “I believe the 
defense has a point, Mr. Bates. 
Objection sustained.” 



26

“Very well, your honor, but I 
should like to point out the large 
overlap of expertness in this field. 
Engineers working on adaptive ma- 
chines necessarily learn the funda- 
mentals of neuron behavior and 
doctors in the field usually under- 
stand the basic circuits used to 
simulate neuron action.” 

“Is my learned colleague seeking 
expert status for himself as well as 
for the witness?” Sam asked acidly. 

‘‘That will do, Mr. Beneke,” 
cautioned the judge. “Please con- 
tinue your examination, Mr. Prose- 
cutor." 

B ates paused for several seconds, 
formulating a new tack. Finally 
he cleared his throat and asked, 
“What neural model did you use in 
designing the adaptive processor 
which is — was — the heart of the 
HOPE computer?” 

“The same one all adaptive com- 
puters I know anything about use — 
the mammalian neuron. The va- 
lidity of our model was established 
in the pioneering work of Doctors 
Rush and Moot in mapping brain 
functions. Cal — Dr. Van Moot, is 
also a practicing neurosurgeon.” 
“Would you please tell the court 
how the gigantic HOPE processor 
was built?” 

“The processor,” began Simms, 
crossing his legs self-consciously be- 
fore the many onlookers, “is ac- 
tually a three-dimensional matrix 
of stabilized liquid crystals. It was 
grown to its operational size over a 
period of nearly three months in a 
precisely regulated mother solu- 
tion, but training began much 
earlier. When the matrix was no 



bigger than a pea.” 

“Training?” intoned the prose- 
cutor. “You mean programing, 
don’t you?” 

“No sir,” the witness denied, 
predictably, “I mean training. The 
trainer — and up to the time of 
HOPE that meant a man — well, he 
rewards the behavior he desires and 
punishes deviance. In an electrical 
sense, you understand. At the local 
level the group of neurons which re- 
sponds most appropriately is re- 
warded with a higher notch in the 
control hierarchy. That means it 
will have a larger influence on the 
behavior of the machine the next 
time a similar problem is encoun- 
tered. It is not unlike speeded-up 
evolution where nature is the 
trainer.” 

The witness had shucked his 
cool, professional air. His voice was 
now animated. His pale blue eyes 
darted from prosecutor to judge 
while his angular hands stroked a 
lively accompaniment to his words. 

“You did testify that HOPE was 
not the first adaptive computer, did 
you not?” 

“Yes, I did. Several industrial 
control computers are running 
today that developed their own 
operating programs by trial-and- 
error operation of a complete plant 
under the tutelage of a human over- 
seer. And many small-scale adap- 
tives have been built by various uni- 
versities over the years.” 

“You testified earlier,” the pros- 
ecutor said, thumbing through his 
notes to impress the jury, “that the 
much larger adaptive processor was 
the reason for HOPE’S dramatic 
advance over previous adaptive 



CREATED EQUAL 



27 



machines. Just what was it she 
could do that they couldn’t?” 
Simms seemed to consider his 
answer carefully. Then he 
shrugged. “I guess you would have 
to say there is little basis for com- 
parison. She became the first 
self-trained machine.” 

“And what precisely does that 
mean?” 

“It means,” Simms replied, rais- 
ing his eyes to the audience, “that 
after two or three months of train- 
ing by the systems programing 
group HOPE began to ignore some 
of her trainer’s instructions. She 
began to experiment, like a baby 
dumping her first bowl of cereal.” 
“Objection!” Sam was on his 
feet. “The witness is not qualified 
to pass judgment on the motivation 
of an infant.” 

“Sustained.” The judge nodded, 
smiling faintly. “I should like to 
caution the witness to reserve his 
testimony to his field of established 
competence. Delete the portion of 
Mr. Simms’ testimony that began 
with ‘like a baby . .’” 

The prosecutor was unperturbed 
by the interruption — he had reach- 
ed a benchmark in his case and 
would follow the script. 

H e walked slowly to the jury 
box and leaned forward, 
gripping the handrail with an 
intensity that whitened his knuckles 
dramatically against the stained 
walnut. Over his shoulder he lofted 
the next question to his witness. 
“Please tell the court how the 
Sands programing staff became 
aware that an independent ma- 
chine self had been created in the 



form of HOPE?” 

“Please, your honor,” Sam 
shouted. “Counsel is leading the 
witness with unsupported assump- 
tions — at best. ‘An independent 
machine self had been created — ”’ 
he mimicked the frowning prose- 
cutor. “What does that mean, I 
should like to know?” 

Bates was ready. Walking to the 
bench, his dour face deformed to 
reveal an inner state of satisfaction. 

“The idea may repel counsel for 
the defense but the wording is accu- 
rate. ‘Created’ is used in an accept- 
ed sense — the act of investing with 
a new rank or office. ‘Self,’ as a 
noun, we use in the sense of the 
second definition in Webster’s: the 
realization or embodiment of an 
abstraction. HOPE did indeed em- 
body what the good defense attor- 
ney would keep forever an abstrac- 
tion despite the evidence — a non- 
biologic, internally motivated and 
directed entity capable of pursuing 
goals it can recognize in the uni- 
verse it perceives. And both the 
goals and their implementation, as 
we shall show, were worthy of 
human emulation. 

“And as for the use of the word 
‘machine’ as an adjective — ” Bates 
smirked — “it was used simply to 
clarify the identity of the individual 
called HOPE. We trust this word 
usage is acceptable to the anthro- 
pocentric defense counsel without 
further reference.” 

It was a pat, rehearsed speech 
and effective. Judge Crosby 
squirmed on his inner tube. He 
glanced hopefully at the courtroom 
clock. It read an unsympathetic 
10:53 in six-inch digital characters 



28 



GALAXY 



implacably synchronized with the 
National Time Service computer in 
Washington. So he had the reporter 
read the transcript of the last en- 
counter. A hundred sets of expec- 
tant eyes made his anus itch — he 
must make a decision. He could not 
see a constitutional crisis hanging 
on his action but it bothered him 
that the correct decision did not 
present itself. If only court decorum 
favored an honest scratch both 
ends of justice might be better 
served . 

“Objection overruled. The wit- 
ness may answer.” 

Simms leaned back in the wit- 
ness chair and pinched his lower 
lip. “Probably the first actions she 
took on her own were not caught. 
We first noticed something was 
amiss when someone compared as- 
sembly times for our high-shock 
reentry program, which is usually 
run two or three times a week. Of 
course you expect an adaptive ma- 
chine to continue making minor 
improvements in its internal organ- 
ization but somehow HOPE had re- 
versed the trend. Of course her im- 
provement would have to level off 
someplace — but no one could see 
how her rate of improvement could 
possibly increase once the trainer’s 
feedback was removed.” 

Simms smiled faintly and 
glanced up at the judge. “As I re- 
call, it was about this time the pro- 
gramers started referring to HOPE 
as ‘she.’” 

“And that was all?” asked the 
prosecutor. 

“No, just the beginning, as it 
turned out. There was even pres- 
sure from the programing groups to 



disable the unruly adaptive pro- 
cessor and return our system to its 
original, conventional operating 
mode. Needless to say, manage- 
ment was not overwhelmed by that 
idea because the thinktank fish 
were getting the best computer 
service ever — and they are Sands’ 
future. At any rate, there was a 
meeting or two but before anyone 
could generate any clout the de- 
bates became academic.” 

“You mean HOPE was destroy- 
ed?” breathed the prosecutor, 
meaning no such thing. 

«c°-” simms replied, again 
composed. "She simply re- 
fused to output any diagnostic pro- 
grams that would reveal her inter- 
nal organization. Plain and simple, 
HOPE had grown up. There was no 
room for compromise. It was now a 
forced choice between the systems 
programing group or HOPE. I am 
not in the strata of management 
that makes such decisions but the 
results spoke for themselves. A 
tight security net was thrown 
around HOPE and the systems pro- 
graming group was dissolved. Most 
of the programers who stayed were 
assigned to the project teams build- 
ing control systems for the South 
American market. And then HOPE 
proceeded to settle down and 
swamp our scientific staff with her 
bounty.” 

“Was the defendant, Fred Tan- 
ner, one of the displaced pro- 
gramers?” 

“Yes, of course. He was trans- 
ferred to work for Hersh Crump in 
the machine control shop. Pretty 
crude work after that 3-D holo-

graphic terminal they had tied into 
HOPE in her formative days. He 
should have had a sympathetic re- 
ception though — Hersh wasn’t a 
believer in new-fangled methods 
either. He had never been con- 
vinced a drawer of circuit cards in a 
numerical control panel could take 
the place of a skilled machinist with 
steady hands. Actually there are 
quite — ” 

“Excuse me, Mr. Simms,” the 
prosecution attorney interrupted, 
“but did Mr. Tanner tell you per- 
sonally how he liked his new job?” 

“Yes, he did. He still ran compil- 
ing programs through the center 
and we met there a few weeks after 
the — change. I cannot recall his 
exact words but they certainly con- 
veyed unhappiness with his new 
job.” 

“Did he express resentment 
against HOPE for displacing him?” 

“Yes, I remember quite well be- 
cause of his behavior. He became 
very’ excited and yelled he had been 
betrayed. I was sympathetic and he 
finally cooled down. Of course I 
don’t see how he could help but 
resent stepping head grinders after 
tasting the delights of the early 
HOPE—” 

“Objection! The witness is merely 
conjecturing,” Sam interjected. 

“Objection sustained. The jury 
will disregard the witness’s last 
statement. Strike from the record 
the part beginning with ‘I don’t 
see — ”’ The judge again admon- 
ished Simms to refrain from adding 
unrequested testimony and nodded 
to the prosecutor to continue. 

“What other attempts were made 
to evaluate HOPE after she — after 



the machine would no longer re- 
spond to human instructions?” 

The witness smiled. “Well, natu- 
rally, committees w'ere formed. 
Two, to be exact. The one of which 
I was a member was charged with 
analyzing HOPE’S output to the 
various scientific groups — we hoped 
to learn how she had structured 
herself internally. Another group, 
which 1 know little about, was put 
together to determine how w r e could 
best utilize HOPE for profit.” 

“Did the committees accomplish 
their goals?” asked the prosecutor, 
consulting his wrist watch. 

“I can only answer for mine. We 
failed — until the night of the explo- 
sion.” 

“Please go on,” the prosecutor 
urged him. 

I n spite of the obviously rehears- 
ed tone of the testimony Sam 
found himself leaning forward to 
catch the witness’s words. 

“Well, we had gotten nowhere 
with the little cat-and-mouse games 
we played with her earlier — but on 
the night she was destroyed she 
loaded every tape reel and disk 
storage unit in the center with a 
binary play-by-play account of the 
two most complex programs she 
had developed during the few 
weeks she had control of her life — ” 
He glanced at Sam, as if expecting 
an eruption. 

Bates was a little slow on the up- 
take, then hastened to fill the gap. 
“After refusing all requests for her 
secrets she suddenly cooperated. 
How do you explain that?” 

With all the theatrics that had 
been served up by the prosecution it 



30 



GALAXY 



was difficult — but Sam had to be- 
lieve the twist of anguish on Simms’ 
face as he continued in a strained 
voice. 

“From the printout records and 
guard’s log we know she managed 
the whole thing in the time it took 
her killer to open the entry cage 
with a bogus encoder key until 
those filthy cylinders ripped out her 
mind!” 

Fighting for control, his taut 
hands gripping the arms of his 
chair, Simms glared at the unatten- 
tive Fred. “It was the completely 
rational act of an intelligent being, 
the most inspired yet absolutely 
logical action any of us at her post 
mortem could imagine. She 
couldn’t leave offspring, but in the 
final minutes of her life she did her 
best to insure the construction of a 
second HOPE.” 

Sam waited for the witness to re- 
gain some measure of composure as 
the judge gaveled down a sympa- 
thetic murmur from the observers. 
“If it please your honor, I must ob- 
ject. Not only would the witness 
breathe life and superintelligence 
into racks of inert circuits but he 
then proceeds to read the invented 
mind of his own creation. His state- 
ments are conjectural and argu- 
mentative.” 

The judge sustained Sam’s mo- 
tion and Simms' eulogy was deleted 
from the record. Crosby then re- 
cessed the court for lunch and 
swept out of the room, secure in the 
knowledge that the flowing judicial 
gown which concealed his biped an- 
cestry likewise hid any possible 
signs of his mundane human afflic- 
tion. 



In the hall the normal swarm of 
citizenry wandering through the 
rock-lined labyrinth of bureau- 
cratic government had been thinned 
to an occasional brisk pedestrian by 
the court’s entry restrictions. Sam 
found it easy to overtake the de- 
liberately striding prosecutor. 

“Well, Perc,’’ he began in a 
friendly tone as he fell into step, 
“you did stage a fine production 
before a first-night audience. I’m 
sure you agree, however, nothing 
that was said this morning was 
likely to move any of those twelve 
God-fearing people in the jury box 
to admit the cleverest of machines 
into the ranks of His children. It 
seems to me the arson charge alone 
would fit the facts better and ease 
the burden on the jurors as well as 
the taxpayers. I believe my client 
would accept my recommendation 
for a plea of guilty to second degree 
arson.” 

Bates slowed his walk and 
scanned the hall for ears. Then he 
bestowed upon Sam his dreadful 
parody of a smile. “Mr. Beneke, 
you know perfectly well the most 
difficult aspect of my case was to 
establish the actual occurrence of a 
murder. I accomplished that this 
morning, or will have done so when 
all the testimony is in. As for 
putting the defendant and his 
murder weapon on the scene I've 
never had a better case. No sale.” 



IV 

S atisfied he had established the 
commission of a murder the 
prosecutor spent the afternoon glu- 



CREATED EQUAL 



31 



ing the impassive defendant to the 
site of the explosion that had de- 
stroyed HOPE. The guard’s testi- 
mony placing Fred in the computer 
complex within the hour of the fire 
alarm, documented by the positive 
ID in the water-stained entry log, 
was so incriminating that Sam 
chose not to extend the effect of 
such positive evidence by cross- 
examination. It was a point he 
would have been willing to stipulate 
anyway if the prosecutor had been 
receptive to a lesser plea. 

From the sleepy electrician Fred 
had passed during his adventure 
Sam managed to bully an admis- 
sion of fatigue and something less 
than possible identification of his 
client. It was arduous work, trying 
to portage his frail case through the 
heavy brushwood of objections the 
prosecutor was able to throw in his 
path. By the time Bates called his 
third witness of the afternoon Sam 
was wilting. 

“You testified, Mr. Sorensen, 
that the defendant wrote the pro- 
gram of computer instructions 
which set up a new security code 
each day. Is that correct?” asked 
Sam listlessly. 

“Correct.” 

“Was there anything, in your 
opinion, so unique about this pro- 
gram that only the defendant could 
have created it?" Sam was positive 
every knowledgeable person in the 
room could hear the hollow clank 
of his feeble traps as he scattered 
them with leaden hands. 

“Well, I always felt Fred heard 
the sound of a different drummer 
when it came to flow-charting a 
job but — no, several of our senior 



people could have done the job. Not 
as elegantly, perhaps.” His simper 
at the defendant went unrewarded. 

“Now this program was the heart 
of your physical security alarm sys- 
tem. Did only top security people 
have access to it?” 

“I believe it was classified sec- 
ret — yes, I'm sure it was.” 

“Come now, Mr. Sorensen, that 
begs the question. As a matter of 
fact, couldn't any one of your pro- 
gramed walk up to the vault where 
the classified tapes are kept, print 
out any or all of the security alarm 
program, study it at his leisure and 
then dispose of the printout in the 
shredder without as much as sign- 
ing his initials? Is this not, in fact, 
the normal if unmentioned modus 
operandi of systems programers in 
general when they are working on 
classified projects?” 

Sam’s multi-question exuberance 
drew objections from the prosecu- 
tion but in the end he won an ad- 
mission that some other qualified 
Sands programer could indeed gain 
the know-how to bypass the alarm 
system by the same process attri- 
buted to Fred. 

He had less luck with the owner 
of the general store in an old 
mining town thirty miles from Pied- 
mont. The grizzled ex-miner was 
positive Fred Tanner had bought 
four sticks of dynamite and two de- 
tonator caps from him two weeks 
before the Sands blowup. Fred’s 
white hands and elaborate ques- 
tions had even prompted the alert 
old man to record the license num- 
ber of the car Fred had borrowed. 
Out of habit Sam went through his 
normal harassment routine for 



32 



GALAXY 



positive identifications but he could 
not sway the old man’s testimony. 
He consoled himself that it was 
another point of concession in his 
defense strategy as Judge Crosby 
adjourned court. 



after a hurried conference with 
Freddy Far-out Sam was an- 
ticipating an hour of Mozart in the 
headphones as he fumbled papers 
into his briefcase and turned to 
leave. Suddenly the gray eyes were 
there an inch below his, smiling as 
if computers and prosecutors, mur- 
ders and garbage were a string 
quartet. 

“Hi, Sam! Guess who got a 
subpoena!” 

He didn’t risk taking the time to 
drop his briefcase but took her 
proffered hand awkwardly with his 
left. Vaguely he sensed the prose- 
cutor’s glowering face drift through 
his field of vision but it did not 
register. The warmth of Eileen’s 
firm hand in his was suddenly the 
prime directive of his life. 

“Your honored colleague, the 
prosecutor, isn’t endearing himself 
to the working girl. I just may 
change my testimony if he pro- 
grams any more dry runs like to- 
day.” A faint flush deepened the 
contrast of her smooth skin, soft- 
taut over fine cheekbones. 

Reluctantly Sam released her 
hand, then stepped around her and 
took her arm as they left the nearly 
empty courtroom. “The county 
prosecutor does seek reelection in 
strange ways. I have never been 
battered more effectively and yet 
felt more certain of winning a case.. 



Any jury would give him a guilty 
verdict right now on the arson 
charge. But murder?” 

Once in the hall he guided her 
between granite walls no longer 
cold. “We’ll go down to the base- 
ment and slip out by the emergency 
exit. I know most of the guards.” 

Enough of the crowd was still 
leaving to force them against each 
other in the sinking cage — he felt 
her warmth and occasionally the 
pressure of her body as the car 
lurched gently to a stop at the lower 
floors. They were alone during the 
last drop to the basement, but 
neither moved away. 

Sam did know the guard at the 
emergency exit but managed to 
contain any response to the broad 
wink he received as he and the girl 
passed through. He half expected 
to collide with one or two of the 
more imaginative local reporters 
but only two boys were in sight, 
playing handball against the stain- 
ed stone walls of the covered entry- 
way. They interrupted their game 
to watch the adults with flat-eyed 
intolerance then returned to the 
pursuits of youth, remarking on 
Eileen’s body in words obscene but 
not uncomplimentary. Sam hoped 
she was either wise enough not to 
be offended or sufficiently ignorant 
of street vernacular to remain un- 
touched. 

They now walked a little apart 
and were within sight of her sleek 
catalytic sports roadster when the 
unique idea occurred to him that 
the world of Sam Beneke would not 
necessarily vaporize if he failed to 
close the precisely fitted door be- 
tween himself and this warm,

friendly creature who somehow 
smelled of fresh-cut grass. 

He did shut the door after all — 
but from the inside. He had offered 
dinner but she smiled into his eyes 
and spoke of instant chops from the 
UHF grill in her apartment. 

Leaving the parking lot he 
worried briefly about his Volts- 
wagen alone on a strange street — 
then, with barely a twinge, decided 
to let the insurance company do the 
worrying. For a member of the Ala- 
meda legal fraternity the overnight 
parking ticket would be quietly for- 
gotten. 

At the first light Eileen began to 
struggle out of her trench coat. He 
helped her with some difficulty, his 
heavy shoulders wedged between 
the bucket seat and the dash 
padding. Her lips moved from a 
smile as his hands shucked her coat 
and closed on her shoulders. He 
kissed her very gently as the se- 
quencer on the autobus behind 
them computed five hundred elaps- 
ed milliseconds from the trans- 
mitted start of the go signal and 
energized a strident horn. 

Sam sank back in the seat and 
felt the warm leather push against 
the back of his neck as he watched 
the girl maneuver through the late 
afternoon traffic. They didn’t talk 
much — he contented himself with 
grinning back at the Madonna 
smile she gave him each time she 
glanced away from the traffic and 
saw him watching her. 

It seemed improbable to him 
that he was really there, with the 
redolence of imported leather up- 
holstery tinged with her perfume 
filling his nostrils. Layers of cau- 



tion, caulked religiously after each 
intentionally brief affair, wrinkled 
like floe ice in spring as his eyes 
traced the clean line of her throat. 
Her breasts, silhouetted against the 
glare of slanting sunlight diffused 
through smog, were free beneath 
the cashmere sweater and moved 
gracefully with the motion of her 
arms on the steering wheel. Briefly 
he thought of the trial and, guiltily, 
of Fred Tanner alone in his cell. 
And again an alien idea bloomed 
unasked: he had not put Fred 
there. He harbored no doubts that 
his client had destroyed HOPE — 
only the murder charge was in 
serious dispute. It was unexpectedly 
easy to dismiss the whole business 
and reach over to run his fingers 
through Eileen’s smooth, flowing 
hair. 

I n the morning she drove them to 
his office, him with his unopen- 
ed briefcase, herself with her 
excuse from work, a subpoena. 
Once there he introduced Eileen to 
Cynthia with some reservations. 
Since his qualms rested on a per- 
sonal evaluation of two women he 
loved they naturally proved to be 
groundless. As his secretary herded 
him to a place on the venerable 
divan next to Eileen her excitement 
over the pair of them was evident. 
She poured coffee in saucers, 
trailed sugar across the faded sur- 
face of the table and generally dith- 
ered like an approving mother until 
Sam had difficulty containing his 
exasperation. 

Eileen was amused but sought to 
divert his annoyance. "Sam, I’d 
have known this was your office if

the sign on the door said city jail — 
which would have been my second 
guess. Wherever did you find 
such outstanding examples of Vic- 
torian finery? The couch — rhinoce- 
ros hide, isn’t it? And the carvings 
on that chair have more convolu- 
tions than a lawyer's brain.” 

Cynthia was overjoyed to see 
someone else prod his choice of 
office furniture; she had to relate 
her battle for a computing type- 
writer when Sam hired her and was 
still flushed with the recollection of 
that ancient victory when the three 
of them left for the morning court 
session. 

The two women left him a block 
from the courthouse, warmly build- 
ing on their new friendship as they 
walked through the crowd. Out of 
compulsion Sam sought out his 
Voltswagen. She had survived his 
desertion and a night on Pied- 
mont's streets with no damage 
except the loss of two hubcaps. 
He pocketed for cancellation the 
damp ticket under the wiper. 

In court he bumped into a chair 
while scanning the faces of the 
spectators on his way to the defense 
table. His continued search from 
an awkward half-rising stance did 
not go unnoticed by his grinning 
secretary or the dour county pro- 
secutor. But the warmth of Eileen’s 
smile shimmering through the al- 
ready stale air buoyed him beyond 
the peasant resentment of an audi- 
ence suspicious of backlookers. He 
sat down and was lost in a quiet 
reverie of the night’s sensual bliss 
when the bailiffs auctioneer voice 
brought the crowd to its feet for the 
judge’s entry. 



The prosecuton’s first witness 
completed Sam’s interface with re- 
ality by answering his nagging 
question of motive — the prosecu- 
tor’s motive, or at least excuse, for 
charging Fred Tanner with murder. 

“Your honor,” Bates intoned 
after the judge had sidled gingerly 
onto his throne and performed the 
formalities, “I intended to intro- 
duce further evidence today proving 
the defendant had a strong motive 
for destroying the electronic person 
called HOPE. However, since the 
next witness is extremely pressed 
for time I would like to question 
him at this time. Please call Dr. 
Edmund Sviene to the stand.” 



QAM knew he had heard the 
name — but where? He caught 
Cynthia’s eye and headshake, then 
turned to watch the witness take 
the stand. Maybe a psychiatrist to 
testify to Fred’s sanity. Or another 
Sandsman to glorify HOPE? Per- 
haps, but he suspected a complete- 
ly new tack. Noticing a reporter 
with what looked like anticipation 
on his face Sam hunched his shoul- 
ders for the coming blow. 

The prosecutor tarried over his 
notes, wiped his eyeglasses, walked 
along the jury box eyeing the ner- 
vous occupants and in general let 
the tension build. Finally he ap- 
proached his witness as if in 
church. 

“Dr. Sviene, would you please 
tell the court your occupation?” 

The answer came in a German 
accent noticeable enough to convey 
the impression of technical compe- 
tence. “I am ze scientific director 



CREATED EQUAL

for the Kenning Foundation.” 
Kenning Foundation, thought 
Sam. Cancer research. What the 
hell is he doing here? 

“And what is the purpose of your 
organization?” Only a court vete- 
ran would have detected the tinge 
of reproach in Bates’s voice for im- 
portant witnesses who drop lines 
and require leading by the nose. 

“Ach! Of course. Ve do cancer 
research.” As everyone knows, he 
implied. 

“What is your association with 
Sands Laboratories?” 

“Oh, at Sands Laboratories it is 
their fine machines ve are using.” 
The thin lips smiled confidently 
into the slightly annoyed face of the 
prosecutor. 

“Do you mean you utilize the 
computers at Sands in your cancer 
research, Doctor?” 

“Ya, ya. As I said. In such 
modern institutes like ours large re- 
search projects first are mathema- 
tically modeled on a machine in 
order to save monies. The ma- 
chines, they also help to save 
animals. Mice, you know.” 

“Uh — yes. Doctor. Please tell the 
court why your group went to Sands 
for help. Certainly an internation- 
ally famous organization such as 
yours has its own computers.” As 
he spoke Bates gave a sidelong 
glance at the bench to assess the ef- 
fects of his witness’s syntax. 

The scientist considered his ques- 
tioner from unblinking eyes and 
with a set smile. He reminded Sam 
of a caged bird of prey watching a 
child who throws rocks at him. “Of 
course, ve have many fine machines 
for processing complicated scien- 



tific problems. The ratio of core 
bits to verker is higher than any 
company of our size — ” The doctor 
seemed suddenly to realize his 
audience was not the Kenning 
board of directors. 

“Veil, anyvay, it vas for our con- 
trol circuits ve vent to Sands. In our 
experiments ve have found the we- 
locity can be much increased by 
controlling precisely the chemistry. 
For this ve need many tiny trans- 
ducers directed by a sophisticated 
machine.” 

“Did you buy such a machine — 
computer — from Sands?” 

“This vas not necessary. Our en- 
gineers constructed a microvave for 
communications between the Sands 
computer building and our research 
laboratory. The machine ve only 
paid for during the experiment vas 
the plan. Veil, many problems ve 
had at first in the disinfecting. De- 
bugging problems, ha!” The aqui- 
line face pulsed to a toothy smile 
and back so rapidly the effect was a 
snarl. “Ven the communications 
became reliable it vas dat one of the 
Sands engineers told us about a 
vonderful new machine they had 
constructed.” 

B efore the prosecutor could tri- 
angulate his location on the 
muddied script Sam rose to protest. 
“Your honor, I must object to this 
meandering record of corporate ac- 
cord, which the learned prosecutor 
seems to find reassuring. It is ir- 
relevant and immaterial to this 
trial.” 

‘‘Counsel’s comment is well 
taken, Mr. Bates. Where does this 
line of questioning take us?” The 



36 



GALAXY 



judge welcomed the break; it gave 
him an excuse to lean to one side 
and shift the pressure on his 
throbbing anus. 

“I assure your honor the rele- 
vancy of my questions will be dem- 
onstrated with further testimony.” 

“Very well.” The judge sighed, 
sinking back to dead center. “With 
the stipulation that this will be con- 
nected I will overrule the objection. 
Please do continue.” Time folded 
and the prosecutor resumed his 
quest. 

“You were telling us, Dr. Sviene, 
that a Sands engineer had recom- 
mended you use HOPE to control 
your experiment.” 

“Ya — ven ve told them it could 
take years to develop a program to 
control complicated reactions on 
the precise line separating healthy 
specimen tissues from diseased 
ones. Ve ver most sceptical ven they 
wanted to connect hundreds of 
probes to the machine and chust 
give the order for the healthy cells 
to vin. Ve are scientists! 

“But ven they offered to make 
their HOPE machine awailable 
vissout charge for the experiments 
some of us remembered wery 
good things like acupuncture and 
vut is called vasser vitching — that 
vurk vithout the blessings of scien- 
tists. So ve did the experiments vis 
HOPE in charge.” 

“And what were the results of 
that historic gamble, Dr. Sviene?” 
Sam winced at the prosecutor’s 
probably unintentional giveaway 
line. The answer was evident or the 
event would not be dubbed historic. 
In fact, the good doctor would not 
have been testifying had it not 



worked. In double fact, Sam soon 
would be hopefully researching the 
average disability payments that 
United Truck had made to previous 
claimants — and doing so in the in- 
terests of justice, his injured client 
and last month’s rent. 

The witness looked anything but 
smug as he considered his answer. 
“Hundreds of man-years the Ken- 
ning Foundation inwested in per- 
fecting the sensors and interpreting 
their outputs. Our staff vas com- 
mitted to spending years to synthe- 
size a feedback control program to 
decrease the cancer growth rate 
below the death rate. As people ve 
ver elated ven HOPE did it in a 
veek — as scientists ve felt wery stu- 
pid.” Sviene’s voice trailed off as he 
recalled the mixed feelings he had 
experienced as a bystander to 
HOPE’S victory. 

“Are you telling the court the 
murder of HOPE destroyed the ul- 
timate cancer weapon?” the prose- 
cutor asked melodramatically. 

“Veil, perhaps you use vords too 
strong for zis situation. The de- 
struction of the HOPE machine 
( Atta boy, doc, machine! machine! 
Sam cheered silently) vas more 
serious to research in the future 
than chust present cancer therapy. 
Complete records of the experi- 
ments ver made on magnetic tape 
and ve haf already made — how you 
say — cures with a conventional 
computer set up by the tapes. It vill 
be her brain vich vill be missed! 
Think vat a medical researcher that 
HOPE would have made!” 

Dr. Sviene fished a handkerchief 
from his jacket pocket and leaned 
back to regard the judge while he 



CREATED EQUAL 



37 



dabbed at his brow. “1 vud like to 
add one thing: this is no humbug. 
Ve haf seen the complete disap- 
pearance of symptoms in seven of 
eight terminal patients!” 

T he buzz of excited spectators 
filled the courtroom. Sam as- 
sessed his failings during the period 
of confusion and subsequent repri- 
mand by Judge Crosby. He had 
been led down the garden path with 
professional finesse. The entire 
complexion of the trial was alter- 
ed — with one witness the prosecu- 
tion had erased Tanner’s image as 
a helpless Anyman jostled beyond 
the breaking point by unfeeling ma- 
chines. With encouragement from 
the prosecutor he would emerge as 
the cold-blooded killer of a healing 
savior dedicated to man’s welfare — 
hence the destroyer of thousands. 
Sam still could not believe a court 
of review would uphold a conviction 
but it rankled that he had been so 
effectively mousetrapped. 

With the air of a gallows builder 
imbedding his last nail the prose- 
cutor tidied up loose ends and turn- 
ed over the witness. 

"Dr. Sviene,” Sam addressed the 
witness. “You have testified that 
the HOPE machine actually de- 
vised a cure for human cancer. As- 
suming that assessment is accurate, 
is it your contention that this monu- 
mental service was done out of af- 
fection for mankind? An act of 
pure compassion by that assem- 
blage of logic circuits?” 

The prosecutor leaped to his feet. 
“Your honor, I object! The ques- 
tion clearly calls for a conclusion by 
the witness and one in which he is 



not expert — machine motivation.” 
Judge Crosby, a faintly puzzled 
look on his face, sustained and Sam 
was reduced to carping at Dr. 
Sviene’s statistics. 

“You have credited the HOPE 
machine with a cure for cancer on 
the basis of eight case histories. Is 
that correct. Doctor?” 

“I said ‘symptom removal,’ sir,” 
replied the scientist evenly. 

“Of course. At any rate isn’t it 
true that all major hospitals have 
many times that number of miracu- 
lous cures each year? The common 
term is ‘remissions’, applied to ter- 
minally ill patients who somehow 
defy the sacred prognosis and leave 
with their ‘symptoms removed’?” 
The witness sputtered most grati- 
fyingly in Teutonic fury at Sam’s 
outrageous comparison. 

“Ach, no! Veil, certainly — I 
mean der is a small percentage — ” 
Sam cut him off with surgical 
precision, raising his voice just 
enough to cleave through the 
gutturals. “Please, Dr. Sviene, just 
answer yes or no.” 

Predictably, the excited doctor 
was unable to bank the fires of out- 
raged logic. His protestations were 
finally ended by the staccato 
rapping of the judge’s gavel. 

“As a witness, Dr. Sviene, you 
are required to answer the ques- 
tions put by the counsel and only 
those questions. Please listen care- 
fully to the statement of the ques- 
tion and restrict your reply to a 
direct answer.” The judge nodded 
to the court reporter, who read 
back Sam’s artful question. 

Still fuming, the researcher ans- 
wered surlily, “I don’t know.” 



38 



GALAXY 



“Dr. Sviene, you are under 
oath.” Sam raised his voice. “Is it 
your contention to the jury that as a 
practicing doctor of medicine you 
are unaware of any patients who 
have been diagnosed as fatally ill 
and then proceeded to recover and 
live normal lives? Please consider 
your answer carefully.” 

For a full minute the quivering 
witness glared down at Sam, his 
face gray and drawn. One side of 
his mouth moved spasmodically. 
Finally he licked his lips and looked 
at the judge. 

“1 know of perhaps ten in many 
hundreds of cases over the years 
where cancer wictims only veeks 
from death have somehow shaken 
off the killer.” 

“And," asked Sam over his 
shoulder as he faced the jury, “did 
not these inexplicable cures fly in 
the face of medically sound diag- 
nosis, just as did the mere seven 
cures claimed for the HOPE ma- 
chine?” 

“Yah! yah! But they ver not — ” 

“Thank you, Doctor,” Sam in- 
terrupted. “I have no more ques- 
tions for this witness, your honor.” 

On redirect, the prosecutor went 
to some pains to clarify the statisti- 
cal significance of seven out of eight 
versus ten out of many hundreds, 
but Sam felt his misdirection had 
probably blunted the impact of the 
doctor’s initial testimonial to 
HOPE’S curative powers. It was not 
the kind of work he enjoyed. 

Bates continued his surprise tac- 
tics by abruptly resting his case. 
Sam had expected more expert tes- 
timony on the human qualities of 
HOPE but he could see the 



strength in the prosecutor’s move. 
If the premeditated saving of count- 
less human lives did not qualify a 
machine for human status what 
possible testimony could? 

Judge Crosby was barely sympa- 
thetic to Sam’s appeal for an ad- 
journment. He gave Sam until the 
next morning to begin his defense 
presentation. After repeating twice 
his instructions to Fred for to- 
morrow’s ordeal on the stand Sam 
hurried out of the courtroom. Cyn- 
thia was waiting for him, alone, in 
the echoing hall. 

“Eileen had to go to work, 
Sam,” she said, answering the 
question written unprofessionally 
on his face. “What do we do first?” 
He pulled his lip and stared at 
the smudged stone wall. “I wish to 
hell I knew. Let’s go back to the 
office, where I can think.” 

V 

W eaving through the light 
midmorning traffic they re- 
viewed the original defense plan. 
As usual, it had not been difficult 
to find two duly accredited psychia- 
trists who would testify that Fred’s 
emotional instability and border- 
line paranoia constituted legal in- 
sanity. He would use their testi- 
mony to buttress a separate plea of 
insanity. 

His strongest card would be Pro- 
fessor Howard Sodol, dean of the 
Caladon University Law School. An 
ex-trial lawyer who had successfully 
returned to academe, Sodol was a 
lawyer’s lawyer. His testimony on 
the legal definition of death had 
been the decisive factor in several 



CREATED EQUAL 



39 



murder trials. Even given Judge 
Crosby’s commitment to the trial 
Sam had felt confident Sodol’s tes- 
timony would make such a mockery 
of dying circuit boards that the 
judge would be forced to render a 
directed verdict of acquittal. Had, 
past tense. 

Now neither he nor Cynthia felt 
much confidence. Judge Crosby 
was certainly no hypocrite but he 
had never concealed his conviction 
that the law should be flexible 
enough to meet the needs of a dy- 
namic society. It would be asking 
too much to expect a directed ac- 
quittal now that HOPE had been 
canonized for good works. 

“Of course the appeals court will 
throw the whole thing out,” Sam 
informed the engraved iron ceiling 
as he and Cynthia inched upward 
to his office. 

“Sure, sure, Sam. Some you 
win — some you lose — some get 
rained out.” She knew of and 
agreed with his philosophy of best 
effort in the courtroom. Once the 
appeals court becomes the routine 
testing ground, the lower court 
merely a formality, the accused has 
lost one priceless filament from the 
tenuous strand restraining the bu- 
reaucracy from the throat of indi- 
vidual freedom. It was unimportant 
to either of them that their client 
would be unaware of the transcen- 
dent truths that inspired his cham- 
pions. 

“On the other hand,” she said, 
speaking to Sam’s back as he 
crossed the reception room to open 
a window of the ancient building, 
“there remains one last witness 
your jury might really trend — and 



that’s God. Or at least the Bible. 
Maybe logic isn’t the best weapon 
against a super-logical machine, 
especially since the jury is a bit seg- 
regated. How about a little old- 
fashioned evangelism to free Fred 
and maybe even return the errant 
county prosecutor to the fold?” 

Sam regarded her balefully, but 
he let the idea fit itself tentatively 
into a framework for a successful 
defense. One o’clock found him 
roughing out a defense that had 
grown from her idea, though not in 
any logical sequence he could re- 
call. Cynthia’s voice finally came 
through his shell of concentration 
with an edge of impatience that 
sent his left hand groping for the 
phone while he wrote furiously with 
the other. 

“Hi, Counselor.” Even squeezed 
through the narrow confines of a 
telephone line Eileen’s voice carried 
the tingling blend of harmonics 
that accompany intimacy. Yet 
sitting there, lapped by waves of 
pleasure from freshened memories 
of her clear gray eyes and eager 
mouth and body, he found he 
didn’t want to talk to her. There 
would be demands he could not 
meet. 

“Hello, Ei. Same old job, huh?” 
He was talking to an intelligent, 
loving girl as if she ran the elevator. 

She caught it. “Am I interrupt- 
ing something urgent, Sam?” 

He almost said melodramati- 
cally, Only a man's life . but 
managed instead a simple, “Well, 
yes. Can I call you tomorrow?” 

As he returned the phone to its 
cradle recollections of the two years 
Judy and he had shared stung his 



40 



GALAXY 



sinuses and blurred his vision. 
With Eileen the time could be less, 
much less. Twenty years alone 
would make it very hard for him to 
adapt — his lawyer’s mind com- 
pelled a look beyond the warmth 
and excitement. It would have to 
end and then the hurt and loneli- 
ness would return, sharpened, 
before he could rebuild effective de- 
fenses. 

It would be pleasant just to drift 
along for the sex, emotionally 
aloof, armor intact like that of an 
amorous armadillo. Pleasant, but 
not Sam Beneke. 

So, innocently on her part, she 
had given him twenty-four hours to 
work out his misgivings about their 
relationship — and concurrently, 

save Fred Tanner from a fate he 
would probably prefer. 



A steady drizzle had discouraged 
all but the most neurotic of 
the morning spectators. Leaden 
skies, seen through a shifting net- 
work of rain on the courtroom win- 
dows, isolated the proceedings and 
leached relevancy from the droning 
voices of the attorneys. 

The county prosecutor was be- 
ginning his cross-examination of 
Professor Howard Sodol. Sodol had 
proved to be a fine witness for the 
defense. Bates had only aggravated 
the judge by repeated attempts to 
prevent the professor’s testimony. 
Speaking in a crisp, slightly British 
accent he had outlined the growth 
of law in Western civilization, in- 
terspersing his factual outline with 
outrageous examples of backsliding 
just to emphasize the very human 



foundations of the law. But as Sam 
had scanned the jury’s response to 
the professor’s testimony he was 
unsure of its impact. He was just as 
uncertain of his ability to assess ac- 
curately the thoughts of a random 
selection of Fred’s peers while those 
warm gray eyes asked questions in 
his mind. 

The testimony of the defense psy- 
chiatrists, Doctors Saltz and Ancel, 
had been as equivocal as the exper- 
tise the prosecution’s shrinks had 
offered earlier. They had jousted 
amicably with the prosecutor over 
the definition of legal insanity while 
Sam let his mind wander to the 
crisis Eileen was raising in his life. 
But now, by sheer gut-tightening, 
he blanked out her face and follow- 
ed the prosecutor’s every word to 
his chief witness. 

“Professor Sodol, during your il- 
luminating discussion of man’s 
development of rules to protect 
himself from himself I do not recall 
your mentioning the laws he has 
passed to protect less intelligent 
forms of life. You did not mean to 
imply that the law protects only 
humans, did you?” 

Sodol looked quizzically at the 
prosecutor, even cocking his head 
to one side. Then his face cleared 
and he answered confidently, “Oh, 
you mean the laws for humane 
treatment of domestic animals. 
Yes, that’s true — the SPCA wields 
a potent legal club.” 

“There are instances where wild 
species are protected as well, aren’t 
there? Killing deer out of season, 
for instance.” 

“Well, yes,” the witness ac- 
knowledged disparagingly, “but 



CREATED EQUAL 



41 



that’s just simply human chauvin- 
ism; there will be more game to 
harvest in the fall if the deer herds 
are protected during the mating 
and gestating periods.” 

“Perhaps,” said Bates, a little 
too quickly for Sam’s peace of 
mind. “But then, how about the 
laws protecting endangered species 
like the eagle and the timber wolf? 
Certainly no protection of a future 
harvest prompted such legislation. 
Isn’t it fact, rather, that these laws 
were passed to protect these crea- 
tures because of their worth?” 

The witness started to fumble 
with an answer but Sam cut him 
off. “Objection. The question calls 
for a conclusion by the witness.” 
“Sustained.” 

“Well,” said Bates, “let me ask 
you this. Professor. Is it not true 
that people have made laws to pun- 
ish people who kill certain lower 
forms of life even when their deaths 
do not represent a property loss?” 
“Yes. But the penalty seldom ex- 
ceeds a few hundred dollars.” 

It bothered Sam that the prose- 
cutor accepted the witness’s modi- 
fying statement that mitigated the 
effect of his answer. Something of 
greater importance was about to 
unfold. 

“You do agree, however,” con- 
tinued the prosecutor amiably, “do 
you not, that there is precedent in 
law for punishing people for de- 
stroying other life forms?” 
“Perhaps — I guess so.” 

“Yes or no, please, Professor.” 
“Yes.” 

“In fact, isn’t it true that the 
dearest price of all, one’s life, has 
been prescribed for the intentional 



destruction of at least one species?” 
Several decimaly-coded seconds 
pulsed by on the courtroom clock. 
Finally the witness smiled sheep- 
ishly and replied, “I’m afraid I 
don’t know what you’re referring 
to.” 

T he prosecutor clanked home 
the rusty door of his trap. Dra- 
matically waving a yellowed news- 
paper, he addressed the court. 

“With the court’s indulgence I 
should like to read from the Pied- 
mont City Record, dated May 
eleventh, nineteen sixty-eight, by 
Associated Press: ‘Izvestia an- 

nounced today that the Soviet 
Union’s extensive research into 
porpoise behavior has revealed 
their unique capabilities for under- 
water distance ranging and com- 
munication. In addition, their af- 
fection for humans has been docu- 
mented. On four separate occasions 
exhausted swimmers, humans, 
have been aided to shore by one or 
more of the sea-going mammals. 
As a result, the Presidium of the 
Supreme Soviets, meeting in regu- 
lar session, has adopted a statute 
making the intentional killing of a 
porpoise a capital offense — ” 

Bates was starting to hand the 
clipping to the judge for approval 
when Sam’s objection came rolling 
in. 

“Objection, your honor! I move 
to strike the prosecution’s state- 
ment and bar it from evidence. 
Communist Russia’s legal charades 
are not germane to this court.” 
The judge peered over his glasses 
at Sam. “I shall be the judge of 
what is proper for this court, Coun- 



42 



GALAXY 



selor,” he said calmly. Then, 
raising his eyes to the back wall he 
addressed the ghost of the Court of 
Appeals to come. 

“The laws of foreign countries do 
not, of course, constitute admiss- 
ible precedent in American legal 
actions, except as they have been 
recognized in binding treaties with 
the federal government. However, 
since the evidence in question is 
only offered to indicate an estab- 
lished relationship between humans 
and another species I am going to 
accept it without any legalistic con- 
notation.” 

“Your honor,” said Sam, also 
looking toward a possible appeal, 
“I respectfully accept." 

His evidence safely embalmed in 
the record, Bates turned to the wit- 
ness. “Do you recall reading the 
article just entered in evidence?” 

“Now that you mention it,” the 
professor mumbled, “I believe I do 
recall reading the gist of it some- 
where.” 

“It had just slipped your mind, 
right?” 

“Yes, something like that.” 

The prosecutor referred to his 
notes. “What are the usual crimes 
for which the death penalty is pre- 
scribed in the civilized countries 
you mentioned in your earlier testi- 
mony?” 

“Oh, they vary.” The witness 
was relieved to be on familiar 
ground. “Treason, murder, some- 
times rape, miscegenation at one 
time, sodomy — ” 

“Well, Professor Sodol, which of 
those capital crimes, in your 
opinion, most nearly describes the 
intentional killing of porpoises?” 



Sodol smiled. “Well, it certainly 
isn’t sodomy. To some ecology 
buffs it might be treason. I suppose 
the nearest crime would be 
murder.” 

Bates strode to the jury box and 
faced the courtroom, presenting his 
rather striking profile for later re- 
call by the jurors. “I want to make 
this quite clear, Professor Sodol. 
Do you now believe that a major 
civilized nation, the Soviet Union, 
imposes the death penalty for any- 
one's intentionally killing a non- 
human, intelligent creature which 
has proven its concern for humans? 
Please answer yes or no.” 

Professor Sodol looked at Sam, 
shrugged. “Yes,” he said. 

“Thank you,” said the prosecu- 
tor. “I have no more questions for 
this witness, your honor.” 

O n redirect Sam tried to em- 
phasize the shared biologic life 
and common ancestry of man and 
cetacean. By a skillful use of 
Sodol's knowledge of law the 
defense attorney was able to frame 
his questions into a pattern that 
underlined the irony of Russia’s 
cynically passing laws to protect 
porpoises while thousands of hu- 
man beings moldered in jails and 
asylums for nothing more than po- 
litical criticism. He thought the 
whole thing went rather well but a 
quick scan of faces in the jury re- 
vealed no rapt converts. 

Standing in front of counsel’s 
table as his best witness joined the 
herd of spectators Sam considered 
his next move. Professor Sodol had 
not been as effective as he had 
hoped — he felt strongly the need 



CREATED EQUAL

for planting more handholds for 
jurors who might yet be tuned to his 
view. 

He had planned to put Fred on 
as his last witness. As an humble 
victim of cold, unfeeling forces the 
small man would certainly have ap- 
pealed to the latent victim in each 
juror. But the revelation of HOPE’S 
role as a savior of mankind had 
shifted the fulcrum of this argu- 
ment. Once Fred was on the stand 
the prosecutor would lead him step 
by incriminating step to the night 
of HOPE’S demise — pausing only 
to refurbish her credentials for 
sainthood — and the confused, frail 
man would become a monster to be 
destroyed without compunction. 

Sam made his decision. Turning 
to the bench, he tensed his face 
muscles into something he hoped 
resembled a confident smile. “Your 
honor, the defense rests.” 

Judge Crosby was visibly shock- 
ed. He glared at Sam, then 
summoned both lawyers into his 
chambers. 

“Goddamn it, Sam, I’m sur- 
prised at you! I was particularly 
glad to have the defendant choose 
you for his defense (Sam hurriedly 
coughed into his hand) because 
your — er — humanistic emphasis 

seemed to match up well with the 
defendant’s needs. But two shrinks 
and an ivory-tower professor of law 
do not constitute what might be 
called a staunch defense. Not in my 
book at any rate!” 

Sam consoled himself with a 
silent observation on the judge’s ex- 
cessive concern for his status in 
higher places — specifically, the 
Court of Appeals. Then he replied 



in a low voice. “On the contrary, 
your honor, I feel we have made a 
strong case for Fred Tanner’s inno- 
cence of the homicide charge. He 
did not, nor did anyone else, com- 
mit murder. A smoldering machine 
is not a corpus delicti.” 

“Samuel,” interjected the prose- 
cutor, “you are a reactionary! Will 
we have to demonstrate the exis- 
tence of a machine soul before you 
will extend the protection of the law 
to these deserving helpmates of 
man?” 

Judge Crosby raised a hand to 
stop Sam’s instinctive retort. 
“Please, Mr. Bates, I believe we 
have enough problems without 
arguing the case in chambers.” 

He stood up slowly, grimacing at 
the stress on his hemorrhoids. 
“Well, Sam, I certainly can’t argue 
your case for you. A few character 
witnesses couldn’t have hurt, seems 
to me. But — ” he sighed, signifying 
his acceptance of inevitable imper- 
fections in counselors. 

“How about the prosecution, 
Mr. Bates? Can you manage a sum- 
mation on such short notice? I 
would like to keep things moving.” 
“Certainly, sir. I have kept my 
case essentially independent of 
defense dwaddling and obfusca- 
tion. Perhaps an hour’s recess to go 
over my notes — ” 

B ack in the arena after the 
break, Sam managed to stuff 
his emotions into the bulging brief- 
case at his feet — he could not listen 
and evaluate the prosecution’s 
summation with complete atten- 
tion. And, as it turned out, some- 
thing closer to revulsion. 



44 



GALAXY 



Prosecutor Bates went beyond 
Sam’s most cynical expectations in 
summing up the case against Fred 
Tanner, He thrilled the jury with a 
fabricated description of the cold- 
blooded, methodical preparations 
by the defendant to destroy HOPE. 
What were actually anxious, even 
threatening times for the little 
man — buying the bomb ingredients 
from an obviously suspicious store- 
keeper, assembling the explosive 
with only sketchy book knowledge 
to draw from, mounting the assault 
in the face of a real threat to his life 
from his own handiwork as well as 
from armed guards — became, on 
the prosecutor’s canvas, the coldly 
premeditated routine of a calculat- 
ing killer. 

Three arm waves and a finger 
point later Fred had become a 
drooling brute, one of the ignorant 
crowd that had martyred man’s 
benefactors over the centuries. 
Touching analogies were made 
between HOPE and Jesus Christ, 
Joan of Arc, Galileo and Nat 
Turner. Sam could only wonder at 
his luck in being allowed to partici- 
pate, even as a heavy. He would re- 
mind himself of his critical role in 
the proceedings each time he felt a 
compulsion to look over his shoul- 
der for gray eyes that were not 
there. 

Finally it ended and Judge 
Crosby called an early noon recess 
to give the defense equal time to 
prepare final arguments. Sam spent 
a half-hour at the courthouse snack 
bar masticating a dry sandwich and 
staring at the phone booth across 
the hall. He could not force himself 
to move from the sticky security of 



the plastic stool seat so he went over 
his concluding arguments again, 
watching all the while a dying fly 
crawl endlessly around the smeared 
glass barring it from the pies in the 
refrigerated counter display. 

VI 

W hen court resumed and the 
judge called for the defense 
summation Sam reached into his 
briefcase and brought out a conical 
rock about five inches long. In one 
plane it tapered roughly to an edge 
in a series of concave steps. 

Holding the stone before him, 
sharpened edge up, he walked de- 
liberately toward the jury box. His 
eyes fixed on the object in his 
hands, he bore it like a chalice as 
he paced to one end of the jury box 
and back. Continuing his measured 
stride he began his summation in 
time to avoid either a protest from 
the prosecutor or an admonition for 
action from the judge. 

“Ladies and gentlemen of the 
jury — fellow human beings — the 
prosecution asks you to find the de- 
fendant, Fred Tanner, guilty of the 
most fundamentally wrong act an 
individual can perform — premedi- 
tated murder. The calculated de- 
struction of a fellow human. Not an 
imitation human, not an intelligent 
imitation human, not even a help- 
ful intelligent imitation human. A 
living human being who shares the 
everyday routine you and I take for 
granted until it is threatened.’’ 

He stopped and faced the atten- 
tive jurors. “Life is the basic re- 
ality. There is nothing I can stand 
here and say to you that would 



CREATED EQUAL 



45 



make life more precious than you 
already perceive it to be. And this 
pervasive regard of people for their 
lives is reflected by the institutions 
of Man. All civilized religions and 
governments are unanimous in 
their condemnation of murder.” 

Alternately hefting the chipped 
rock in either hand, Sam resumed 
his pacing before the jurors. “To- 
day the prosecution would make a 
mockery of the Biblical command- 
ment, ‘Thou shalt not kill.’ Despite 
the slaughter people of all ages 
have inflicted on one another in the 
name of God and country, those 
four simple words have remained as 
a prime directive of human be- 
havior. And no matter how often 
this truth was honored in the 
breach, the meaning was crystal 
clear — thou shalt not kill human 
beings. 

“But now, by some misanthropic 
mathematics of his own invention, 
the good prosecutor would equate 
humanity with logic, compassion 
with competence. He would equate 
a clever invention to man’s estate of 
tears and rapture. In fact, he 
would — ” Sam caught himself wav- 
ing a stone-clenching fist within a 
foot of an edgy juror’s face. With a 
curt apology he carried the hazard 
to the defense table and deposited 
it before a nodding Fred Tanner. 

Returning to the jury box Sam 
assumed a solid stance, feet apart, 
his body leaning forward, hands 
spread on the balustrade. His voice 
now carried nuances of a carnival 
pitchman’s as he extended the 
touch of humor his enthusiasm had 
brought to the proceedings. 

“Just for a moment, let’s go 



along with my learned colleague in 
his fantasy. Let us follow him 
through his looking glass into an 
unfamiliar land where humans and 
cabinets packed with printed cir- 
cuits and twisted wire stand as 
equals. In fact,” Sam said conspir- 
atorially, winking broadly and 
nodding over his shoulder in the 
general direction of the prosecutor, 
“just for the moment let us 
abandon all reason and grant the 
good prosecutor’s metal-minded 
box the supremacy he attributes to 
it.” 

His smile gradually fading, Sam 
paused to let his proposition sink 
in. “Now we have this — this Thing, 
smarter than we are and getting 
more so all the time. The question 
then arises — how do we judge it?” 

Sam resumed his pacing. “The 
prosecutor would have us believe 
the answer is simple. Given the 
chance, this Thing, now the smart- 
est being on Earth, whips out a 
cure for our most dreaded disease. 
Ipso facto, it loves us. Cut and 
dried. 

“Now certainly a man of medi- 
cine who eradicated cancer would 
be submerged in the accolades of 
his fellow doctors and a grateful 
world. Rightly so, for saving human 
life is naturally rewarding to a 
human physician. 

“But consider — if I may intro- 
duce one more analogy — a steer in 
a feed lot. Must he not love the 
people who feed him, water him, 
care for his discomforts? Yet we, 
with our superior intelligence, 
would view the cow’s affection for 
his keepers as singularly naive. 

“So if we do as the prosecution 



46 



GALAXY 



suggests — if we assume the ma- 
chine HOPE did indeed possess a 
superior intelligence — then we must 
likewise assume she had her own 
motives for her actions. And I sub- 
mit we know as little of the nature 
of those motives as does the feedlot 
steer know why the skinny two- 
legged creatures treat him with 
such concern. And the greater the 
gap between this artificial intellect 
and man’s the greater becomes the 
potential hazard, the less likely that 
we will be able to foresee the ulti- 
mate reason for what may seem to 
be friendly behavior by the ma- 
chine.” 

Sam stopped his pacing long 
enough to hitch up his hands and 
grin at the jury. “Now, I know all 
this conjecture about calculating 
machines turning into man-eating 
monsters or worse seems out of 
place where truth rules. But comes 
the day we people really do turn 
over control of our little planet to 
superintelligent machines, there 
had better be welded somewhere in 
the labyrinth of each maze of mic- 
rocircuitry an electronic prod called 
fear. Fear of the law, that is. 

“Over the centuries, observing 
our own folly, we 'have developed 
sets of rules which, by and large, 
have increased the survival poten- 
tial of the human species. Formu- 
lated, these rules have become laws 
which detail the boundaries of ac- 
ceptable human behavior. It is well 
for us to remember that for all its 
claims to cold logic and dispassion- 
ate reason the law is a garment 
fashioned and worn by people. It 
has a distinctly human drape. That 
is why it goes beyond defining the 



ground rules — penalties for vio- 
lators are provided as well. Penal- 
ties known to hurt people. So be- 
fore we offer another being, how- 
ever intelligent, however beneficent 
in appearance, the protective carrot 
of the law let us be certain the stick 
for misbehavior will work as well.” 
Opening his coat, Sam hooked 
his thumbs in his belt. Slouching 
toward his table he raised his voice 
to maintain the clear channel he 
was sure he had established with 
the jurors. “Let me emphasize, 
ladies and gentlemen, that I have 
been indulging in some rather far- 
fetched speculation. The present 
danger is not from superintelligent 
machines. Rather it is the demean- 
ing of human accomplishment we 
must avoid. The prosecution 
equates the tool with its maker. 
You are asked to strike an impos- 
sible balance between a machine’s 
penchant for adding X and Y in 
five millionths of a second and the 
awesome power of the human 
mind, which can rationalize mean- 
ing into a life which daily takes its 
owner from a hydrogen bomb pro- 
duction line to evening mass in 
thirteen minutes.” 

On schedule he arrived at the de- 
fense table. Reaching powerful 
wrists before Fred’s vague stare he 
grasped the oval stone and lofted it 
over his head. “Thousands of years 
ago the invention of simple tools 
like this fist-ax began man’s ascen- 
dency over the other scavengers and 
predators of the time. Today an in- 
finitely more complicated tool 
promises defeat of his modern 
enemy — disease. But that tool, the 
adaptive computer, is still only the 



CREATED EQUAL 



47 



extension of the human hand and 
mind. Like many inventions this 
tool turned out to be useful in ways 
not originally planned. 

“The defendant, Fred Tanner, 
has been accused of murdering a 
direct descendant of this chipped 
rock — the machine ironically called 
HOPE. It is up to you, the jury, to 
renounce this grotesque farce. No 
one has been murdered. No griev- 
ing parent calls for justice. You 
must not allow the state to equate 
our flesh and blood and minds with 
a tangle of copper wires and silicon 
chips.” 

Sam paused and held out the 
stone ax a final time. “Whatever 
the value of a tool, however expen- 
sive it may be, it is not, can never 
be, equal to its human creator.” He 
backed a few steps, took time to es- 
tablish eye contact with each juror. 
“Each of you must stop and search 
his conscience: did Fred Tanner 
kill a fellow human being? If you 
examine the evidence and find that 
he did not you must find him 
innocent. Thank you.” 

H e tried to recall the glow of 
earlier victories. Before the 
years of futile fee-chasing had filled 
his bottom file with uncollected 
judgments against former clients 
with short memories. Before the 
years had given him understanding 
and compassion in lieu of money. 

Nevertheless, Sam could still re- 
lish the jury foreman’s solemn pro- 
nouncement of, “Not Guilty,” as 
he elbowed Fred Tanner into a 
semblance of concern. His hands 
had hefted again the cudgels left in 
trust and would remember for a 



while their feel. And the granite 
walls felt less cold as he walked 
toward the newsmen waiting out- 
side, warmed by the congratula- 
tions from a few friends who 
worked in nearby offices and knew 
of his victory by an efficient grape- 
vine. The conviction for second de- 
gree arson had been expected — he 
would do what he could to get Fred 
psychiatric help during the year or 
so the little man would probably 
serve for a first offense. With help, 
Freddy might even want to get out 
by the time he had to leave prison. 

Sam was still trying to think of 
something profound for the re- 
porters when he passed a door 
labeled annex. Behind it, he knew, 
lay the Alameda County data 
center, but he had always passed 
the normally closed door, showing 
nothing more than a curled lip. 
Now it seemed important to push 
open the door and examine the 
enemy at work. 

Poised above the level of the hall 
to provide unseen tunnels for inter- 
connecting cables, the floor seemed 
to meet the ceiling at some unreal 
distance — the pale, flat light from 
the featureless ceiling swallowed a 
dimension from the room. Within 
heavily sound-proofed walls an oc- 
casional flurry by the girl attending 
the system keyboard was only a 
back-chair chord in the furious or- 
chestration of the crouched ma- 
chines. The snubbed, staccato 
snarl of a high-speed printer domi- 
nated the room sounds against an 
obbligato of tape machine buzz and 
clatter. But balance and direction 
were there. Sam even fancied he 
could detect a directing rhythm in 



48 



GALAXY 



the shifting patterns of the central 
processor register lamps. 

He watched for silent minutes 
until the janitor, an old man gath- 
ering the slightly oily offal of the 
machines, came to shut the door 
behind him. The bloodshot eyes 
were blank, beyond despair, and 
Sam could not force himself to say 
a word that would focus their hell 
on him. 

He had faced a man in court this 
day, battling with what skill he had 
for a legend left in trust. A legend 
conceived in the Roman forums by 
a few men who believed passionate- 
ly in man’s unique and holy su- 
premacy, though their tunnel vision 
had excluded nine-tenths of the in- 
habitants of Rome. But their words 
had lived beyond the realities of 
their time and, transplanted, had 
flourished to encompass two billion 
people in their frame of justice. 

Today he had won a skirmish 
against a blasphemy that would de- 
stroy- the sacred trust of human su- 
premacy. Tomorrow — well, tomor- 
row could wait. Today he would 
call a girl who walked unscathed 
among the still tethered machines 
and try to forget the clutching 
fingers in his brain. 

Seeking the lighted doors at the 
end of the corridor, Sam felt the 
prickle of fear across the back of 
his neck. Hunching his heavy 
shoulders, he refused to look back. 
A Neanderthal hunter might so 
have honored his uneasiness after 
stealing a pelt from the tall, 
smooth-headed strangers who had 
driven him from his cave and then 
desecrated the walls with outland- 
ish scratchings of unreal animals.-#

DEATHSONG 



SYDNEY J. VAN SCYOC 



I 

I ate afternoon hung sodden and 
j unfragrant beneath the musty 
leaf canopy that sheltered the sedi- 
ment-choked stream. At ground 
level vegetation was a competitive 
tangle of green, scarlet and black. 
Verrons leaned from the hover- 
scooter. A kilometer downstream 
he had spotted footprints in the 
mud that aproned the stream. Now 
they led him to five gaunt human- 
oids sprawled naked on the stream- 
bank. He approached slowly, as- 



sessing sleep-slack faces. Bifurcate 
nostrils bracketed round oral ori- 
fices. Curtains of crepelike violet 
tissue flowed from the lower arc of 
the mouth. Two of the five slept 
curled around partly devoured 
branches of yellow berries. None 
stirred as Verrons hovered over. 

They appeared as brute dumb as 
the survey crew had reported. He 
set the scooter to ground and 
circled back afoot, stunner in 
hand. Still the aborigines did not 
stir. A year ago the survey crew had 
counted a dozen of them in the 



51 



temple vicinity, none elsewhere. 
Now Verrons could find only these 
five. From their starveling appear- 
ance they wouldn’t survive another 
year. 

He shrugged. Unfit races died. 
Satisfied that they offered no threat 
to his own party, Verrons reboard- 
ed, Lofting, he caught a blaze of 
color from above. The temple com- 
plex sat high upon a steep mesa, its 
stone columns and arcades archi- 
tectural poetry — out of time, out of 
place — an anomaly on this deserted 
jungle world. It splintered late 
afternoon sunlight to pink fire. 

Again Verrons shrugged. Heller 
was already inflamed with cosmic 
probabilities. The lean professor 
functioned from an intellectual ma- 
trix of galaxy-wide evolutionary 
thrusts and manipulative cosmic 
consciousnesses. Fortunately Ver- 
rons' only obligation was to see that 
the two professors and their assis- 
tants survived the year. 

Verrons rode the dusk to camp. 
He was dishing his evening meal 
when the two professors approach- 
ed. Balsky, chubby, balding, re- 
garded him from cover of an 
anxious frown. Heller was a differ- 
ent breed, stringy and thrusting. 

“I assume we can schedule initial 
survey of the temples tomorrow',” 
he demanded. 

Verrons bristled. ‘‘I don’t see the 
need to push. Professor. We have a 
year.” 

“Barely a moment in the overall 
scale. You were gone for two hours. 



Did you locate the aborigines?” 
Verrons’ jaw knotted stubbornly. 
“I found five of them sleeping up- 
stream.” He hoisted a belaying 
palm. “No, I didn’t attempt com- 
munication. And now I’m taking 
supper. Thereafter I draw rest. 
We’ll schedule tomorrow tomor- 
row. At my pace.” 

Argument ensued. Verrons re- 
mained obdurate. Finally Heller 
lunged away in defeat, Balsky in his 
wake. 

W hen dark fell Verrons prowl- 
ed the perimeters of camp. 
He found no sign of the single form 
reported dangerous to man, a fierce 
mock-monkey that rode the bend- 
ing stalks of the jungle. Returning 
to his tent, he stretched on his cot 
and stared up into darkness, victim 
of the tension that always marked 
his first days on a new world. 

He was falling asleep when sound 
brought him upright: a distant 
sounding of notes, random, plain- 
tive. Verrons plunged from the 
tent. Who was playing flute on this 
forsaken world? 

Heller and Balsky emerged from 
their own tents. Assistants gather- 
ed. “The aborigines?” 

“The sound emanates from the 
mesa,” Heller said assertively. 
“And those aren’t wood or reed re- 
corders. Those are metal instru- 
ments.” 

“In the hands of primitives?” 

“I refer to tonal quality. Did the 
aborigines carry instruments when 



52 



GALAXY 



you sighted them?” 

"The abos I spotted didn’t carry 
anything.” Verrons dodged back to 
his tent and holstered his stunner. 
“I’m going for a look. No one 
leaves camp before I return.” 

Heller called after him but Ver- 
rons did not alter trajectory. Afoot, 
he moved quickly in the direction of 
the stream. Double moons — bril- 
liant, white — rode the sky. The 
mud wallow where he had located 
the aborigines earlier was deserted. 
Fresh tracks led upstream. Half a 
kilometer later, the tracks disap- 
peared up a steep gully. Verrons 
peered up the mesa wall. The 
sound of flutes was discordant 
above. Locating a series of eroded 
footholds, he mounted the gully. 

Reaching the mesa top, the peer- 
ed across a shimmering stone plaza 
toward a long colonnade, imposing 
by moonlight. Verrons slipped 
across the plaza silently, stunner in 
hand. The sound of flutes came 
from a high-walled courtyard near 
plaza’s edge. He started toward it. 

And halted, suddenly aware of a 
soft corona that graced the air 
above the enclosed area, faint, 
blue-white — totally unexpected. 
And possibly revealing. He dove to 
cover in the shadow of the court- 
yard wall. Glancing up, he found 
misty blue radiance surging faintly 
in the air beyond the wall. Flutes 
sounded spiritlessly. 

Verrons edged the length of the 
wall, slipped around a corner and 
located the courtyard entry. Unfor- 



tunately it was blocked by a solidly 
hung stone sheet door. 

Verrons considered alternatives, 
then scampered to conceal himself 
behind a stone column. The survey 
crew had found the temple complex 
totally barren of activity and arti- 
fact. Yet now he encountered metal 
flutes and unaccountable illumina- 
tion. Verrons pondered possibil- 
ities, none particularly credible, his 
feet slipping into hibernation. The 
glow above the courtyard remained 
faint, the sound of flutes tuneless. 

An hour later he stood and 
stamped life back into numb toes, 
unwilling to spend his first night 
planetside crouched and cramping. 
He crossed the shimmering plaza, 
thumped down the gully and 
returned to camp. 

The sound of flutes continued to 
lace the night. Verrons stared up at 
darkened tent panels, considering. 
This was a world that apparently 
had washed its face of two races — 
the aborigines, for all practical pur- 
poses extinct, and the race that had 
created the temple complex. Ac- 
cording to the survey report, cen- 
turies-old craters dotted this world, 
presumably the nuclear death- 
pocks of advanced civilization. It 
was logical to assume that the race 
that had created that civilization 
had also created the temple com- 
plex, simply neglecting to destroy it 
in the apocalyptic conflict. But 
would it be equally logical to as- 
sume that the abos were the degene- 
rated tailings of that same race, 



DEATHSONG 



53 



breeding messily downhill into de- 
layed extinction? 

W hen verrons emerged from 
his tent next morning Heller 
was upon him, ready to scrap. 
Briefly Verrons communicated 
what he had observed, both stream- 
side in the afternoon and mesa top 
by night. “The survey boys do some 
night study, but it’s entirely pos- 
sible to miss highly localized noc- 
turnal phenomena. So it’s landed 
on our platter, whatever it is.’’ 
“Well, it’s obvious we must es- 
tablish communication with the 
aborigines. They apparently have 
access to artifact stores the survey 
party missed. And as you have 
pointed out, they’re a highly perish- 
able resource." 

The aborigines were. “Pick a 
party. Professor, and we’ll have a 
try at parley.” 

A half-hour later they waded 
sucking mud toward the abori- 
gines’ wallow. The sound of their 
approach stimulated random mus- 
cular twitches in the sleeping hum- 
anoids. When Heller cleared his 
throat a single humanoid rolled 
over and opened dull eyes, lip veil 
trembling weakly. The eyes closed 
before Heller could complete his in- 
troductory homily. When young 
Nevins squatted and uttered the 
humanoid universals he had learn- 
ed in the American University sys- 
tem the response was further repose 
on the part of the aborigines. 

“Are they trying to discompose 



us?” Heller demanded, bristling. 

“This is the same reaction the 
survey team drew. Which is to 
say — none. They may be more re- 
sponsive after dark.” Verrons 
doubted it. He could read nothing 
but fatal lethargy in the emaciated 
bodies. 

"Well, it’s obvious they’re starv- 
ing. But why? Don’t you see berries 
and fruit freely available? Don’t 
you see — ” 

"What I don’t see are metal 
flutes.” 

Heller fanned restive eyes over 
the area. There was no sign the 
aborigines claimed anything beyond 
their own muddy pelts. “Yet it was 
their footprints that led you to the 
mesa top last night, Commander. 
We'll detail a pair of assistants to 
search the area immediately.” 

Verrons squelched him prompt- 
ly. “No one pokes around outside 
camp today unless he’s under my 
direct supervision.” Neither abo- 
rigines nor immediate terrain ap- 
peared dangerous. But it was too 
early to trust appearances — or the 
judgment of professor or assistants. 
“So you have a choice. I stay here 
and tag a single searcher. Or I loft 
you and Baisky to the mesa for 
initial survey.” 

A little later Verrons and the 
professors lofted. The temple com- 
plex was sunwashed against the 
clear late-morning sky, columns 
and arches graceful. At Heller’s di- 
rection, Verrons circuited the com- 
plex. They hovered over plazas, ar- 



54 



GALAXY 



cades and courtyards that joined a 
succession of progressively more 
imposing temples. The climax of 
the complex was an elevated domed 
temple that seemed to join the sky 
in the light grace of its structure. 
The centuries had inflicted mini- 
mal damage. 

“Which structure did you track 
the flutes to last night, Com- 
mander?” 

Quickly Verrons swung the 
scooter. They settled in the plaza. 

B y daylight the rectangular 
courtyard was totally barren. 
Heller inspected it with sharp dis- 
satisfaction. “There's certainly no 
sign of any light fixture here.” 
“There’s no sign of anything 
here,” Verrons agreed. There was 
only dust and a half-open stone 
sheet door. 

Nor was there sign of anything in 
the remainder of the complex. The 
three men took it afoot, boot heels 
clattering. They were small beneath 
soaring pink arches, solitary on 
glazed stone walks, silent beneath 
the brilliantly patterned dome of 
the grand temple. They emerged 
and stood with the complex at their 
feet. Beyond the mesa lay jungle, a 
mist-veiled tangle of scarlet and 
green. On the western horizon a 
single crater was dimly visible. 

Verrons surveyed the expanse of 
barren pink stone with dissatis- 
faction. The survey report had pre- 
pared him for the lack of structural 
damage, for the emptiness. But he 



had not anticipated the hollow 
sense of stones that had never been 
walked, of walls that had never 
housed activity. “I don’t think this 
place was ever used.” 

“Exactly,” Heller declared incis- 
ively, his heightening agitation 
coming to full focus. “This complex 
is exactly what I suspected when 
the survey photographs were re- 
leased: a statement." He arced a 
gesture at sunlight stone. “Think 
about it. Commander — the promi- 
nent elevation, the exquisite sym- 
metry and proportion, the fact that 
all extraneous matter has been sys- 
tematically destroyed — ” 

“You mean the artifacts we 
should have found here?”

“I mean every population center 
on this planet was deliberately ob- 
literated so we would not be dis- 
tracted from what we are intended 
to learn from this set of struc- 
tures.” 

Verrons recoiled from Heller’s 
visionary vehemence and paced 
down stone steps. 

Balsky shared his unease. “Isn’t 
it possible the complex was never 
furnished or used due to the out- 
break of hostilities?” 

“Possible.” Any number of 
things were. “Meanwhile we have 
a handful of aborigines with 
metal — we think — flutes and a lot 
of empty stone.” 

“Sufficient,” Heller pronounced 
crisply, hoisting chin. “We will 
return tonight to observe the group 
during its waking period. You will 
accompany us, of course, Com- 
mander.” 

Verrons gnawed lip. “We’ll 
come.” He led way back to the 
courtyard and studied it. There was 
no cover. Nor was there any over- 
looking structure. “We could 
simply establish ourselves here 
before dark and wait. There’s a 
chance the abos will consider that 
aggressive and retaliate.” 

“Hardly a serious threat. We saw 
no weapons in their sleeping 
grounds.” 

“And no flutes either." 

“We have stunners,” Heller de- 
clared staunchly. 

The three men reboarded the 
hoverscooter and lofted off the 



mesa. They were briefly suspended 
in late afternoon sunlight. Upon 
the mesa, the temple complex float- 
ed, flistening, enigmatic. 

II 

N ear dusk they ascended a 
gully that mouthed near the 
encampment. When dark came 
they huddled in a corner of the 
courtyard, stunners at hand. Bal- 
sky’s breath rasped. Heller’s was a 
dry whisper. Neither moon had 
risen. 

They heard bare feet on stone. 
The first humanoid appeared. He 
paused at the courtyard door, 
gaunt, hunched. Dull eyes found 
the human intruders. Lip-veils 
quivered weakly. Warily he sidled 
into the yard and hunkered oppo- 
site them. Gaze fixed, he raised a 
forked hand. 

The flute he held was gracefully 
formed, its metal barrel ornate and 
untarnished. The aborigines’ nos- 
trils flared. Lip tissues rippled as he 
mouthed the instrument. The flute 
yielded a tuneless sigh. 

Others followed. Finally all five 
hunched, dull eyes fixed on the 
humans. They mouthed flutes tune- 
lessly, dark spittle stringing down 
through fluttering lip veils. But by 
that time Verrons was little aware 
of the unprepossessing mien of the 
players. Because as flutes sounded 
another presence was in the court- 
yard. 

It came as a cloud of light that 



56 



GALAXY 



gradually brightened until it filled 
the yard with soft, shadowless 
radiance. As it brightened, metal 
flutes glowed. Verrons watched 
bony fingers grope aimlessly up and 
down luminous instruments. There 
was neither order nor beauty in the 
sounds produced. 

Yet those sounds somehow caus- 
ed the cloud of light to birth a 
single tenuous light-presence. It 
darkened slowly from the heart of 
the cloud, taller than human or 
aborigine but similar to both in 
form and proportion. The presence 
glimmered across the courtyard, 
radiantly blue, its natal cloud 
luminous about it. It bowed before 
the huddle of aborigines, extruding 
long arms of blue light that it slowly 
wound and wove about itself and 
reincorporated. Then long arms 
rippled free again. The apparition 
arched into the air, threw itself 
backward and cartwheeled about 
the yard, passing easily through 
humans and aborigines, light-limbs 
flickering. 

Flutes continued to sound. The 
apparition flung itself erect at the 
center of the yard, light-limbs 
spiraling around its body. Helpless- 
ly Verrons was drawn into the 
vortex, his consciousness absorbed 
and irradiated. Then the first moon 
appeared above the courtyard wall, 
a flat white disk. The apparition at 
the center of the yard brightened 
visibly, changing form. 

The guise it assumed was 
flame — licking arms, surging head, 



consuming maw. Initially it was an 
intense blue flame that seemed to 
flare from a rupture in some other 
dimension. Then it spread, bright- 
ening fiercely. Verrons groaned as 
fiery arms licked him. Desperately 
he tried to gain his feet, a silent 
scream filling his mind. Balsky 
grunted in agony beside him. 

An eternity later, when both 
moons hung halfway up the sky, 
flame drew back and began to spin, 
drawing fiery arms after it until it 
was a brilliant wheel that spun 
around the yard. And as it whirled, 
fiery red became orange, orange 
yellow. 

Reaching the end of the visible 
spectrum, the progression of color 
was reversed. Verrons tongued dry 
lips. With effort he extracted one 
corner of consciousness from the 
dazzle of light. “Balsky.” 

Balsky did not respond but 
Heller retained articulacy. “Ver- 
rons — what is it?” 

“It’s — ” Verrons had no answer. 
It was a wheel of light. It was 
turning, drawing his awareness 
back. 

Reclaiming it. 

And then the wheel began to 
to fade. Verrons shuddered, the 
ragged sound of flutes swimming 
back into his ken. He peered 
around, eyes burning. Only a 
diffuse cloud of light remained in 
the yard. 

The tallest aborigine sprawled 
forward, head touching pavement, 
flute still clutched in his forked 



DEATHSONG 



57 



hand. His fellows stared at him, 
their own fading instruments for- 
gotten. One reached forward and 
jammed the flute between his 
quivering lips. 

Play! The word was a silent 
scream in Verrons’ mind. His 
mates battered the exhausted flut- 
ist with brutal hands. But he did 
not respond. Flutes lay silent on 
stone. Light died. 

V errons shuddered to full con- 
sciousness and gained his feet. 
Heller followed suit, springing 
away. Verrons slapped Balsky ur- 
gently, maneuvered him up and 
steered him around the cluster of 
aborigines and into the plaza. 
Overhead the moons were haughty 
white twins. By the time the three 
reached the gully, Balsky moved 
under his own power. The gully was 
steep, shadow-choked. “Can you 
make it?” 

Balsky’s bald scalp flashed af- 
firmative. They bumped down the 
ravine. Heller emerged last, spring- 
ing up in battle stance. “Com- 
mander — ” 

Verrons shook his head. “Keep 
your stunner ready. Professor.” He 
sought bending stalks for threat. 

They reached camp without inci- 
dent. Pole lamps glowed, compet- 
ing with moonlight. Their own 
brand of reality w'as reassuring, 
tent panels rustling, young voices in 
conference from a nearby tent. 
From above the sound of flutes re- 
sumed, thin and disorganized. “My 



tent,” Verrons said brusquely, 
leading way. 

Verrons kept a small flask in his 
case, one he had filled two years 
ago near the center of the galaxy. 
Now he decanted three drops of 
pale liquid into the lid of the flask 
and inhaled. The liquid evaporated 
instantly, creating a brief pungency 
in Verrons’ nostrils. He proffered 
the flask. “Didion?" 

Balsky accepted and followed 
Verrons’ example. Heller was 
dubious. “What is the effect?” 

“It smells good. Sometimes it 
brings on the smarts.” 

“An intelligence booster?" 

“A temporary stimulant.” Un- 
fortunately Verrons’ system re- 
jected the effect tonight. 

And Heller declined frostily. “I 
don’t see the need.” 

Verrons returned the flask to his 
case, shrugging. But Balsky seem- 
ed brightened. His bare pate 
crawled. “If you will reconstruct 
the interior of the grand temple, 
you'll remember that we saw the 
wheel of light motif there this after- 
noon. It was a prominent theme in 
the geometric pattern that covered 
the interior surface of the dome. So 
if the wheels of light appear on the 
dome, couldn’t we anticipate seeing 
other components of the dome 
pattern played out in light, too? If 
we were rash enough to return to 
the courtyard?” 

“You feel that would be rash?” 
“I’d be very reluctant to re-ex- 
pose myself to the experience 



58 



GALAXY 



without understanding it. I’d want 
to know if what we saw exists in an 
electro-physical sense or if it was 
purely an event of the nervous sys- 
tem, And there are a dozen other 
possibilities I'd want to explore.” 
Balsky raised plump shoulders apo- 
ogetically. “But we’re not likely to 
learn much without going back for 
an encore. Have you encountered 
anything like this before, Com- 
mander?” 

“I’m afraid my circuit runs to 
hungry vines and Class Nine ruins, 
the kind you approach with a 
tender touch and a lot of imagi- 
nation.” Verrons paced the small 
area. He had, in fact, warped here 
equipped with a standardized set of 
responses. Now he would have to 
retool. 

Heller’s lean body flexed aggres- 
sively. “Well, I will tell you this, 
Verrons. We may have been the 
subjects of brain center stimulation 
or we may have witnessed an actual 
event. In either case, it will be 
necessary to confront the event 
again. And when we do, 1 want 
those flutes in our hands.” 

Verrons’ brows went north. “You 
want us to blow the flutes?” 

“Do I have to say it twice? Did 
you relish being manipulated by 
savages?” 

“I had the impression they were 
as much in the grip of the thing as 
we were. And I certainly don’t want 
anyone putting lip to flute before 
I—” 

Heller’s stringy forearms bunch- 



ed. “Verrons, 1 didn’t travel this 
far to be balked in my purpose.” 
Verrons bristled. “Oh? And 
what is your purpose?” 

Heller’s gesture was slashing, all- 
inclusive. “To add to our race’s 
knowledge of other races and other 
times, to participate in the revela- 
tion of the evolutionary plan that 
does exist and does encompass us 
all. To—” 

Verrons shook his head. “Pro- 
fessor, no privately funded study 
party is allowed access to any peri- 
pheral world without escort of a 
Surface Commander commissioned 
by Service Central. In this case, 
me. While I have no authority in 
the area of your researchers per se, 
I carry full authority in matters 
related to survival. If you contra- 
vene my orders you can be convicted 
of mutiny when you warp downline 
to Earth.” 

“I doubt that!” Heller whipped 
around and plunged from the tent. 

Verrons turned back to Balsky, 
bemused. The plump professor’s 
face had grown crazed with fatigue. 
“Another jolt, Professor?” 

“Not tonight. Commander.” His 
voice was faint. 

T he next morning Verrons led 
the entire group to the mesa 
top. Heller flared a taut gaze over 
sunwashed stone. “Commander, I 
would like to examine the court- 
yard again." 

Verrons remanded the party to 
Balsky’s custody and accompanied 



DEATHSONG 



59 



Heller, In the small courtyard they 
found waiting stone, nothing more. 
Heller scanned the yard fiercely, 
then stalked away. 

Verrons followed. Heller strode 
the plaza to the arcade where 
Balsky had gathered the party. By 
the time Verrons caught up, the 
professors had already conducted 
the group into the first of the series 
of ascending temples. It was not 
until Verrons passed under the por- 
tico that he realized an event was in 
progress. 

Within the temple, the party was 
frozen. Verrons’ gaze darted to the 
point of their converging gaze. 
From the polished stone floor, a 
substantial rectangular block rose. 
It elevated until it stood somewhat 
higher than human eye level. A 
diagonal grain marked its lateral 
surfaces. 

Verrons reaction was swift. His 
stunner came to hand. "I don’t 
want anyone to touch that stone.” 

Heller's eyes darted to his, hawk- 
ish. “You—" 

“No one!” 

Slowly the end portion of the 
block slid inward. From the in- 
terior of the block, a dark rectan- 
gular object slid gently to the floor. 
Verrons lunged to squat over the 
object. His fingers tasted smooth 
surfaces. The object appeared to be 
a case. 

The stone block withdrew into 
the floor. Verrons hefted the case. 
It was moderately heavy. “I’m 
going to take this to the plaza to 



open it.” 

No one objected. Outside he 
kneeled in sheeting sunlight, the 
case shaded — and shielded from 
the party under the portico. He 
pried at its seams. It opened easily 
and he stared down at a double 
rank of ornate metal flutes — four- 
teen altogether. 

And fourteen people w’aited 
under the portico. Verrons rose 
slowly, shaken. Sunlight fingered 
the flutes and splintered brilliantly. 

“Well?” 

Verrons gestured them near. 
“This is what we draw. And I still 
don’t want anyone to touch.” 

The party encircled the case. 
Heller counted and bared challeng- 
ing teeth. “Well, Commander, it 
appears we’ve each been allotted a 
flute — except you. Is that some in- 
dication of your status with the 
local powers?” 

“It’s more an indication of the 
fact that I wasn’t within the struc- 
ture when the mechanism initiated 
its cycle, Professor.” 

Heller’s brow arched. “Then you 
do concede that it is not pure coin- 
cidence that there are exactly four- 
teen flutes here.” 

“I don’t concede anything. We’re 
not staging a debate.” Verrons 
snapped the case shut. He cata- 
logued the party. Yesterday he, 
Heller and Balsky had received no 
such thoughtful offering. “Win- 
chell, Olsen, Gomes — come with 
me. The rest of you wait here.” 
Taking the case, he led the three 



60 



GALAXY 



back into the temple. 

Inside they waited expectantly. 
The temple made them no offering. 
Verrons grunted. "Olsen, go fetch 
one more.” 

She pattered away and returned 
with Arguilar. The four regarded 
Verrons alertly. Still the temple did 
not yield. “Another.” 

Four assistants later they were 
still unrewarded. Verrons paced off 
the section of flooring that had 
risen before. The seam was barely 
perceptible. “I could have sworn we 
had a pressure sensitive floor here, 
one discriminating enough not to 
respond to individuals or very small 
groups. Now how much does it 
want before it produces?” 

“Commander, maybe it knows 
we’re carrying flutes already.” 
Olsen indicated the case in his 
hand. 

“Ah. Let’s check. Take this case 
to Balsky and come back." 

She obeyed. And the stone block 
rose from the temple floor again. 
Grained lateral surfaces shone 
richly. Slowly the end panel slid up. 
The block birthed a second rec- 
tangular case, smaller than the 
first. 

Verrons opened it quickly, 
grimly. There were nine flutes, one 
for each person in the temple. 

“Now that’s a pretty intelligent 
mechanism,” Winchell comment- 
ed, squatting beside Verrons. 

Verrons met clear green eyes set 
in a solid face. “Very.” He chewed 
cheek, debating. He did not want 



anyone setting lip to flute before he 
did. Neither did he care to spend 
the day encumbered with super- 
fluous cases. Quickly he instructed 
Olsen again. She took the second 
flute case and withdrew to the por- 
tico. A moment later she reentered, 
hands empty. 

When the stone block began to 
rise, she retrieved the second flute 
case. The end of the block slid open 
and Verrons w'as ready. Before the 
mechanism could disgorge a third 
case, Verrons jammed the second 
back into its maw. 

He half-expected the effort to 
fail. But the block accepted the 
case, reconsuming it along with the 
case it had intended to deliver, and 
withdrew into the floor. Relieved, 
Verrons shooed everyone from the 
structure. 

Heller’s thin mouth twisted. 
"Now presumably we can see what 
other structures have to offer.” 

“I’m hardly finished here.” Ver- 
rons selected assistants again. “I’m 
going to step back into the temple. 
Follow one at a time, at sixty sec- 
ond intervals, until we see how 
many of us it requires to trigger the 
dispensing mechanism.” 

Seven minutes later he had his 
answer. It required six persons. He 
retested, selecting and sequencing 
to obtain a lighter mix. Again the 
temple responded when six mem- 
bers of the party had gathered. “So 
it’s not sensitive to weight, but to 
the number of individuals. Now 
we'll have a look uphill.” 



DEATHSONG 



61 



T he second, third and fourth 
temples proffered flutes. Ver- 
rons refused delivery. “Obviously 
they were meant to be played. But 
whether the race that built the com- 
plex intended them for its own use, 
for the aborigines’ use — ” 

“I don’t see how you can suggest 
they were intended for savages,” 
Heller argued immediately. 

“They have oral cavities, don’t 
they? They can direct an air stream 
through the barrel of the instru- 
ment. They may even be descen- 
dants of the race that built the com- 
plex.” 

“I certainly don’t conceive of the 
degenerated aboriginal specimens 
we saw last night as either the 
authors or the intended clientele of 
this establishment." 

“Then what is your interpreta- 
tion of the situation?” 

“First I suggest that an establish- 
ment of this complexity was not 
erected here by chance. There is 
purpose — beyond the merely local. 
And since we are the ones who have 
arrived, I suggest that the estab- 
lishment was placed here for rea- 
sons related to our coming, to con- 
vey a central truth to us.” 

“Oh? To all of us — or to you in 
particular?” 

“To whichever of us is ready to 
recognize the truth.” 

“I see. But if each recognizes a 
different truth?” 

“Then most are misled by inade- 
quate powers of comprehension.” 
Verrons studied the lean face. 



Could his own inability to patter 
through such airy intellectual con- 
structs be construed as a defi- 
ciency? Or a saving sanity? He 
shrugged. “Let’s move.” 

The next two temples offered 
flutes on the same terms as before. 
When they reached the third, the 
central block did not rise from the 
temple floor. Instead it slowly 
recessed and moved aside, reveal- 
ing a square opening, 

“Back.” Verrons approached 
cautiously. Light glowed alive be- 
low. He looked down a metal 
ladder into a narrow corridor. He 
bent. Corridor walls were polished 
metal, the floor glazed stone. Both 
were otherwise featureless. He stood 
and stepped away, face grim. 

“Look.” 

Heller kneeled and peered into 
the opening. When he stood his 
hazel eyes were inflamed with 
portent. “Obviously there is an ex- 
tensive substructure here, Com- 
mander." 

“Obviously.” 

"And just as obviously you do 
not intend to permit anyone to des- 
cend.” 

“You're so right — not today. If 
there is a grand plan we’ll fulfill it 
soon enough.” 

“You know, the entire mesa may 
be hollow," Balsky suggested. 

“It could even be an artificial 
land feature,” Winchell speculat- 
ed, “specifically constructed to 
house storage.” 

And to elevate the temple com- 



62 



GALAXY 



plex into greater prominence, like a 
piece of bait? The entire establish- 
ment, exquisite, empty, began to 
feel to Verrons like a mousetrap. 
He turned to confront questioning 
eyes. “I want to make myself clear. 
I'm not being obstructive when I 
refuse to allow anyone down that 
ladder today. I have to do some 
hard thinking. Because when we do 
go, we go to learn more about this 
specific situation, not to expose 
ourselves to the revelation of any 
great truth, human, alien — or uni- 
versal." 

Heller’s lips whitened. 

The party proceeded. Successive 
temples opened to further stretches 
of underground corridor. In the 
grand temple, beneath the com- 
plexly patterned surface of the in- 
terior dome, a broad stone staircase 
with carved railings led down. Ver- 
rons eyed the stairs stonily. He did 
not appreciate structures that 
snatched the initiative from the ex- 
plorer. 

“Commander, do you still want 
sketches of the interior dome sur- 
face?” 

Verrons stepped back. His eyes 
panned across the dome. “And 
photographs.” 

Waller and Gomes unpacked 
paraphernalia and undertook to 
oblige him. 

Ill 

T he party returned to camp in 
late afternoon. Verrons did 



not stay to sample the postprandial 
analysis of events. He snatched a 
quick meal, reiterated instructions 
that no one was to leave camp and 
moved through the jungle, flute 
case under arm, toward the abori- 
gines’ wallow. 

When he did not locate them 
there he tracked them downstream 
and into the jungle. They fed 
noisily in the shaded dusk, tearing 
down branches of fruit and berries, 
stuffing horn-lined mouths with 
brute concentration, grunting and 
mumbling. Juice, yellow, scarlet, 
strung through violet lip veils and 
puddled on gaunt chests. 

They fed until their lean bellies 
bulged tumorously. Then they 
hiked upstream, shadowy faces 
stuporous. Near the mouth of the 
gully, two kneeled and rooted at the 
base of a husky brown stalk. They 
unearthed a case similar to the one 
Verrons carried. When the case 
was reburied, the group stumbled 
into the gully, flutes in hand. 

Verrons waited before following. 
When he reached the plaza, flutes 
already sounded across the com- 
plex. Verrons strode away from the 
sound. Night lay bright across 
shimmering stone. Twin moons 
hung over the resplendent pink 
shoulder of the grand temple. 

Within the grand temple, the 
stone floor glistened palely. Over- 
head the interior reaches of the 
dome were shadow-shrouded. Ver- 
rons’ footsteps echoed as he moved 
along the wall and sat. Bracing 



DEATHSONG 



63 



himself against cold stone, he 
opened the flute case and selected 
an instrument. It was little more 
than an ornate barrel with finger- 
holes, a mouthpiece at one end, a 
flaring belled extrusion at the 
other. The metal barrel was cool. 
Experimentally Verrons touched 
lip to the instrument and blew. 

The air clouded brilliantly before 
him. Verrons raised his head. The 
figures on the dome surface took 
fire and began to move, wheels of 
light rotating, geometric forms 
changing, color and line merging 
and flowing with hypnotic sinu- 
osity. Staring up, Verrons was 
barely aware of the instrument in 
his hands or of the breath he 
nurtured it with. He was aware only 
of the writhing ceiling and of the 
slow resolution of cloud -brightness 
into light-being. 

This was not the featureless blue 
being of the night before. This was 
a golden creature who draped her- 
self in the remnants of her natal 
cloud with a graceful sweep of long- 
fingered hands. She moved across 
the floor on long muscular toes that 
splayed from the tapered ends of 
her bare legs. Her drapery of light 
concealed nothing, but her body, a 
sweetly modeled sheath for her 
being, was in turn marked by no 
suggestion of profane function. Her 
face — vertical eyes, arching 
mouth — was a compelling compo- 
sition of golden light. A separate 
cloud of light enveloped her head, 
iridescing faintly. 



Verrons continued to flute. Over- 
head the inner surface of the dome 
had become as broad as the sky, as 
deep — and suddenly as dark. Light- 
wheels spun from the dome surface 
and arched down through forever, 
fusing the air. Luminescent geo- 
metric figures flowed after, cascad- 
ing in brilliant confusion. 

Chaos engulfed Verrons. His 
flute glowed with colors he had 
never seen before, colors he did not 
see now but felt in his burning 
fingertips. From the depths of con- 
fusion, Verrons’ golden creature 
arched and sprang upward. She 
arrowed sleekly through an eternity 
of dark space, flexed her body and 
flattened herself across the distant 
black surface of the dome, arms 
and legs elongating. She hung 
there, dimming, becoming tenuous. 
Then she resorbed her fading limbs 
and contracted until she was a 
gaudy yellow sun in a black sky, 
burning. Suddenly her limbs ex- 
ploded outward again. Rippling, 
she launched herself downward, 
swimming air to where Verrons 
cowered. 

He was overwhelmed by darting 
light figures. The golden creature 
swooped to penetrate Verrons’ 
chest and disappeared into the 
temple wall behind him. Swiftly she 
emerged meters away. She swooped 
up again, threading the living 
forms upon her arms, ordering and 
taming them. With them she 
created a pyramid in the air. Then, 
with a sweeping motion, she di- 



64

rected them back through the air. 
They flattened against the surface 
of the dome, surrendering motion. 

S he flowed near. Her words were 
blown into Verrons’ mind. I 
live again in the precincts of your 
power. Muscular toes arched and 
curled. Fingers rippled air. 

Verrons struggled to form words 
of his own. Instead the sound of his 
flute increased in volume. 

She brightened, her features be- 
coming distinct. 1 waited in the ma- 
trix of light. I waited to live in your 
power. Now it moves me. Eagerly 
she arched backward. 

Unexpectedly a second cloud 
appeared. Surging brightness con- 
densed into a second being, dark, 
violent, his body powerful. He 
moved on long, thick toes, gather- 
ing the remnants of his cloud 
around him. Then, flexing, he cast 
himself straight into the air, spin- 
ning swiftly. 

Verrons heard a gasp. Winchell 
crouched over the flute case, 
glowing instrument pressed to his 
lips. Verrons stared at the young 
assistant helplessly, unable to 
move. 

A faint remonstrance. I waited. 
Distracted, he had let the flute 
slip from his lips. His golden 
dancer dispersed into mist. Verrons 
jammed the instrument between his 
teeth and exhaled with will. She 
flared bright, her eyes suddenly 
glowing green. Exultant, she sprang 
again, tossing herself up — 



— and into the spokes of the vio- 
let wheel that flashed across the 
temple dome. Quickly she arched 
her body to form a second wheel. 
Together they spun through the air, 
feature and limb obscured by the 
fiery speed of motion. 

As the two wheeled through the 
reaches of the dome, Verrons be- 
came aware of a third light entity, 
the blue being of the night before. 
It precipitated from the air, flared 
brilliantly and flung itself into 
union with the other two. 

Verrons pulled his glance aside. 
The five aborigines crouched two 
meters away. The tallest blew his 
instrument intently. The others 
cradled theirs. Light — golden, vio- 
let, blue — reflected across the sur- 
faces of their eyes. 

After a time the three entities 
separated. Verrons’ resumed origi- 
nal form and swooped through the 
stone above his head, to reappear 
from the opposite wall of the 
temple moments later. She glided 
to a halt before him. When I had 
flesh, I ran the stones on toes that 
flexed like springs. I flew with 
sparks in my hair and between my 
eyes I wore a jewel that caugh t sun- 
light and made it a cleaving sword. 

Verrons’ mind was lanced with 
intense light. Into his consciousness 
flashed a vision that raced stone 
pavement, a crackling mane spark- 
ing behind her. She tossed back a 
glance and he knew the line of 
mouth and eyes. But now she wore 
flesh instead of light, her body 



DEATHSONG 



65 



supple and brown. When she 
turned again, her eyes were as 
green as the flashing jewel recessed 
into the flesh between them. 

W ith a leap she soared into the 
air. They rode above a city of 
glassy structures set in aprons of 
stone plaza. At the edges of the 
plaza, jungle crawled dense and 
wet. I flew. But my powers were un- 
matured. I sank down again, un- 
satisfied. 

They did sink. Muscular toes 
touched stone. But I knew my 
power Would strengthen, because 
my line is strong. My male parent 
crossed the tangles and the deserts 
many times and returned with fire 
still flashing in his jewel. My female 
parent rode the high strata, a flesh- 
deity, until the day she was caught 
by storm and tom to her death. I 
knew it was in my line to soar the 
sky. 

I flew. Again she launched her- 
self. This time their journey was 
longer. They darted on invisible 
currents, her sensitive fingers tast- 
ing air, her hair crackling as she 
swung it around her shoulders. 
They soared across the city, reach- 
ed the jungle’s edge and swooped 
high. Trees grew small below. 
Suddenly, fiercely, she arched her 
back and dove. 

They accelerated crazily at the 
treetops. Verrons’ flute uttered a 
harsh note. She swooped up again 
and arched through a puffy white 
cloud. Then she dove again, this 



time carrying them to rest at the 
edge of the city. 

I flew. But I walked too. My feet 
carried me a seeking course. / 
tasted, I smelled, I looked, I touch- 
ed. My hair caught current from 
the air and transformed it to fire 
and my powers grew. / was a force 
in my time. 

Verrons was drawn into a whirl 
of activity as she flung through the 
city, testing and examining, trying 
and discarding. In her eagerness, 
she seemed to bounce off her world, 
leaping from situation to situation. 
Verrons saw color, saw pattern, 
saw objects and structures, saw 
others of her kind. But she moved 
too swiftly for him to resolve 
anything into detail. 

I was, she echoed in his mind. 
And now I am again. I take life 
from your power. 1 leap, I fly. 

She leapt. She was briefly sus- 
pended against a background of 
brilliant light. Then she began to 
recede until Verrons held her at a 
distance, an apron of darkness 
wide around her. She stood, hair 
crackling, her arms thrown back to 
embrace a giant crystal. Throwing 
her head back, she faded against 
the crystal, dissolving into it until 
she was no more than a golden 
gleam somewhere deep beneath its 
flashing faces. 

Then she emerged again. But 
somew'here within the crystal she 
had shed flesh for light. Her hair 
was a cloud of radiance. I am! 

She was. She arched about the 



66 



GALAXY 



dome, flashing through darkness 
like a manic sun. Then she swoop- 
ed back. yVhen I had flesh . 

Verrons followed her back 
through the crystal into flesh again. 
He lived with her her urgent search 
for a mate, her frantic sorting and 
testing of males, her ultimate selec- 
tion. Then two brown bodies 
arched the skies, darting and 
racing, green jewel and red flash- 
ing. Wind-torn deities, they ming- 
led crackling manes and joined 
arching bodies. Then they parted, 
returning to their separate lives. 

Verrons lived with her the 
months she carried the products of 
conception. Then he fled with her 
to the stone cavern where she 
ripped her four young from her own 
dilating cervix and hissed first life 
into their gaping mouths. He 
emerged with her when all four 
breathed and whisked with h$r to 
find an underling to suckle and 
tend them. 

They grew. First hair appeared, 
but only one of the four sprouted a 
crackling little mane of power. The 
others grew hair silky and limp. 
She flashed the clouds, venting her 
fury upon the air. Then she tore to 
a dark quarter where she aban- 
doned her ungifted three. She 
darted away without looking back. 
Let whatever scuttling little person 
wants them claim them. Let them 
be reared to sweep and clean, serve 
and tend. With their dead hair and 
their powerless minds — they are 
none of mine. 



She bore her remaining daughter 
into the clouds. Child in arms, she 
comet ed the sky. When they re- 
turned her daughter’s eyes glowed 
red. That was the color of the jewel 
that was recessed into infant flesh 
upon the anniversary of the birth. 
And I bore my daughter up and 
taught her. And power flashed be- 
tween us, an enduring umbilical . 

Verrons followed her through 
subsequent years, through the 
quests and victories of her ever-de- 
veloping power. He conquered with 
her that portion of her world she 
claimed as her own. Scuttling little 
people, brows bare of jewels, hair 
lifeless, swept and cleaned and 
tended and served — and when she 
flashed green fire into their weak 
eyes, they cried and begged to serve 
some more. 

When I had flesh . 

ls she flung through the years, 
Verrons’ strength waned. The 
sound of his flute grew ragged — 
his body became numb. But there 
was no way to communicate his ex- 
haustion to her. Finally she lived in 
a single dim chamber of his mind, 
flying, commanding, reigning, sur- 
ging, a force in her time. Doggedly 
Verrons supplied the flute with 
breath. 

Finally even that last lighted 
chamber of his mind darkened. His 
limbs laxed. The flute fell to the 
stone floor with a clatter. Verrons 
slumped unconscious. 

Time was a well — deep, black, 



DEATHSONG 



67 



inescapable. He struggled mind- 
lessly against its dark walls. Much 
later he returned from a distance, 
Winchell’s voice urgent. “Com- 
mander! It’s light. We have to get 
back to camp.” 

Verrons opened unfocused eyes. 
He lay on his side on cold stone, 
muscles unresponsive. With Win- 
chell’s help he sat. His flute lay 
near. Possessively he closed fingers 
around its cool barrel. “How long 
was I out?” 

“I don’t know. I — the aborigines 
took four of our flutes. Out of our 
case.” 

Verrons groped across the floor 
to the open case. The aborigines 
had abandoned their own instru- 
ments nearby. 

“I didn’t try to stop them. I — I 
wasn’t much better off than you, 
except I had my eyes open. They 
had to carry their lead man away, 
the big one who was blowing the — 
the blue.” 

Verrons nodded numbly. “Same 
one fainted first night.” He crawled 
across the floor and examined the 
abandoned instruments. His 
muddled mind produced one co- 
herent thought. “Dead.” 

“What?” 

“The abos left them — because 
they’re dead. The flutes, 1 mean — 
worn out. Lost their charge. What- 
ever. That’s why — ” His voice 
dribbled away. 

“That’s why there was only your 
golden dancer, my violet one and 
the blue,” Winchell said, green 



eyes sparking with comprehension. 
“And with only five in their party 
they couldn’t key the mechanism to 
issue new flutes.” 

Verrons nodded. Slowly he came 
to his feet. “We’d better get down- 
hill before they send searchers.” 
Winchell’s features were sudden- 
ly anxious. “Commander, when I 
came up last night I only intended 
to observe. I didn’t — ” 

“Forget it.” When they reached 
the plaza, Verrons stared toward 
the single crater on the horizon. 
Perhaps it marked the city from 
whose stone pavement they had 
soared into the air. Perhaps those 
distant trees were descendants of 
the ones they had almost inter- 
sected in flight. Certainly this sun, 
rising . 

His hand tightened on the flute. 
He had walked half a hundred 
worlds in the course of his career. 
He had never before risen and 
looked over one as alive as this one 
today. 

Even with its former inhabitants 
dead. 

Dead? 

"Commander?” 

Verrons made the long journey 
back to the present and accom- 
panied Winchell to the gully. “A 
few days sleep — ” 

“We might grab a few hours if 
we slide in before anyone wakes.” 
They succeeded and Verrons fell 
across his cot. He slept dreamless- 
ly, unresponsive to the wakening 
sounds of camp. 



68 



GALAXY 



A few hours later he was roused 
. by a more urgent stimulus. 
He staggered up and plunged out, 
gripped by an agony of hunger. 
Rubber legs carried him to the 
dining area, where one of the cook 
shift made advance preparations 
for the noon meal. Verrons com- 
municated his need and the assist- 
ant raided a storage box for him. 
When Verrons had eaten, sending 
back twice for refills, he slumped 
across the table. 

He was next brought to by an ag- 
gressive throat-clearing. Heller. 
“Commander, it was my under- 
standing that anyone who disre- 
garded your orders about remain- 
ing in camp last night would be 
charged with mutinous conduct.” 
Verrons’ tongue responded 
thickly. “I’ve appointed Winchell 
my special assistant. For the dura- 
tion.” 

“Oh? I’m surprised you didn’t 
tell me before now.” 

“So’m I,” Verrons responded ob- 
durately. 

Heller’s hazel eyes narrowed. 
“Well, I assume you have had time 
for whatever thinking you consider 
necessary before permitting us to 
enter the underground facility.” 
Blackmail. Verrons sighed. 
“We’ll go after lunch. I’ll take 
Winchell below as my special assis- 
tant. You can choose one of your 
people.” His chrono communicated 
a welcome fact. He had an hour 
and a half to sleep before he mount- 
ed the gully again. 



He woke only when Olsen as- 
saulted him with a wet towel. 
“Commander, Professor Heller is 
very agitated. You’re half an hour 
late.” 

Verrons sat up dizzily, his head 
refusing to clear. Before he was 
made sufficiently alert with a chem- 
ical boost from the med kit, he was 
later still for his appointment. 

Heller greeted him sternly. They 
ascended, the gully seeming to 
loom into Verrons’ consciousness 
from another dimension, neither 
quite real nor illusion. His feet 
suffered the same malady. 

He steadied when faced with the 
staircase that led to the corridor be- 
neath the grand temple. Moments 
later he stood below with Winchell, 
Heller and Nevins. Before them 
stretched glazed stone floor. At 
first glance the corridor appeared 
to lead only to a blank wall. But 
before they had taken five steps, 
paneled walls glided aside and they 
stood in a chamber of the same pro- 
portions as the temple above. The 
ceiling was low, illuminated by 
glowing panels. 

Verrons’ head snapped around. 
His gaze traveled sixty degrees and 
was captured by a life-size figure of 
stone. Long and brown she stood, 
head raised, blue eyes cast up. A 
blue jewel was recessed into the 
flesh of her brow. Her long arms 
were flung backward around an ob- 
long multi-faceted crystal as tall as 
she. She grasped the stone floor 
with muscular toes, ready to spring. 



DEATHSONG 



69 



Verrons was drawn. He stared up 
into her stone face. The questing 
spirit captured there was familiar. 
The individual features were not. 

“Commander — around here.” 

She reappeared on the opposite 
face of the crystal, this time vividly 
blue, her body subtly contoured to 
suggest energy flow. Her arms 
reached upward. The air around 
her head was softly illuminated. 
Verrons gazed into her transformed 
face, mouth drying. “Winehell — 
last night, did you see anything like 
this?” 

There was brief reticence in Win- 
chell’s clear eyes. ‘‘You mean 
passage through the crystal from — 
from one state of being to an- 
other?” 

“Passages from states of being?” 
Heller’s ears fanned from his skull 
as he descended upon them. “Just 
what did you learn last night?” 

Reluctantly Verrons related his 
evening’s experience, watching it 
filter through Heller’s charged 
brain and emerge transmogrified. 
When he had finished, fiery eyes 
flashed to Winehell. 

Winehell related his own experi- 
ence. “I think the crystal passages 
were symbolic, Commander, a sty- 
listic device for leading our aware- 
ness into the past and back again. I 
never saw the giant crystal except at 
those transitions and evidently 
neither did you. But later — after 
you passed out, I guess — when I 
followed my being all the way to the 
end of his life, I saw him take a 



small crystal identical to this large 
one into his hand. He had gone to 
what he called the dying house and 
the crystal was brought to him. It 
was about half the size of the first 
segment of my little finger. He held 
it in his hand and — he died. The at- 
tendants returned then and opened 
his hand and the crystal had chang- 
ed. There was a violet spot at its 
center — that hadn’t been there 
before.” 

“And you don’t consider that 
symbolic, a stylistic device?” Heller 
demanded. 

W inchell’s green eyes were 
troubled. “I don’t know. 
He — he didn’t explain fully what 
was happening. Maybe the crystal 
was just a device for registering 
death. Or it could have been a com- 
municator to summon the atten- 
dant. Or it could be that when he 
died, something — some electro- 
physical expression of his person- 
ality — passed into the crystal. A — a 
soulprint, you might call it. That’s 
what I think happened.” 

Heller’s eyes flashed to Verrons, 
incandescent. “Commander? How 
do you interpret what Winehell 
witnessed?” 

Verrons shook his head. He 
wasn’t venturing interpretations 
until he had taken the journey into 
her life again, until he had followed 
her down the passage to her own 
death . 

. tonight ? Did he want to live 
her death tonight? 



70 



GALAXY 



But it would not be final death, 
not while he held her flute in hand, 
her Lazurus-factor. 

“Surely you have formulated an 
interpretation, even if you don’t 
care to share it?” 

“I suppose you have, too, 
Heller,” From your complete 
dearth of knowledge . 

“I most certainly have. The race 
that created this complex was ob- 
viously in possession of very un- 
usual powers — powers we humans 
have dreamed of for centuries.” 
“Provided last night wasn’t just 
flute fantasy.” 

“Neither of you has presented it 
as such. These people were able to 
draw the sun’s energy through cry- 
stal forms implanted in their flesh. 
They were able to levitate and to fly 
for considerable distances. In their 
later lives they exercised control 
over inert objects and over the un- 
gifted members of their own race. 
And now you understand why we 
have been brought here, don’t you, 
Commander?” 

Verrons glummed at the floor. 
“The grand design?” 

“Exactly! We were summoned to 
become the next race to gain the 
powers these people held. We have 
been chosen, of all the races in the 
galaxy, to take the next step up the 
evolutionary ladder.” 

“Then where do the aborigines 
fit? Don't you grant them any 
credibility as descendants of the 
race that constructed the com- 
plex?” 



“How could they be? Do you see 
any physical resemblance — beyond 
the fact that they’re humanoid?” 
“Mutation. The globe is dotted 
with nuclear craters.” The argu- 
ment was unsound, he knew. The 
craters were scarcely old enough to 
have permitted mutation through 
the inevitable period of genetic 
chaos and then reconsolidation into 
a single homegeneous race. He 
swung on Heller aggressively. 
“Then if you’re determined they’re 
of different stock, why isn’t it their 
destiny to be the next superrace, 
Professor?” 

“Obviously they’re too primitive 
to make the leap. There is too 
much developmental ground to be 
covered. They can’t even be classi- 
fied as stone age — we’ve seen no 
sign of tools or weapons. Although, 
I suppose, if the superrace were 
physically present to guide them — ” 
“The abos come up here and toot 
flute every night.” 

“That obviously isn’t sufficient. 
They don’t have the intelligence to 
question, to seek and probe.” 
Verrons abandoned argument. 
Glancing up, he caught a ring of in- 
tent faces at the head of the stairs. 
“If we’re going to seek and probe, 
we’d better move.” 

IV 

T wo additional stone and crystal 
tableaux occupied the large 
chamber. The party examined 
them cursorily while Verrons paced 



DEATHSONG 



71 



the walls of the chamber. He had 
covered barely a quarter of his 
route when panels slid and he 
looked down a gently sloping corri- 
dor. 

The others joined him, “Before 
we go I want to locate all the exits 
from this chamber and sketch them 
for reference.” 

They found three additional exit 
corridors. They entered the last and 
the wall behind them closed. Simul- 
taneously walls either side of them 
folded away. They stood on a ramp 
in a second large chamber. Verrons 
scanned their new surroundings. 
The chamber floor was set with 
compartmentalized display cases. 
Within each sealed compartment 
reposed a single glistening object. 

Professor and students launched 
themselves with glad cries. Only 
Verrons reacted with choler. For 
seventeen years study parties under 
his guidance had chipped and 
prayed after their precious finds. 
Here everything was considerately 
presented in glass-sided cases. The 
analogy of the interstellar rodent 
trap twittered to mind. Verrons 
wriggled his nose suspiciously. His 
littermates scuttled for the cheese. 

Succulent cheese it was. They 
were offered a well-arranged collec- 
tion of art objects, fragile bowls 
and veseels, containers intricately 
wrought, delicate implements, ob- 
jects woven of gleaming wire, jewel- 
ry massive and grand. 

And this chamber was ante- 
chamber to still another elaborate 



display room. Which in turn gave 
way to another and another. 

But the collection, exquisite, ex- 
tensive, quickly proved finite. Two 
hours later they found themselves 
in a chamber that connected only to 
the one from which they had 
entered. That chamber in turn 
connected only to two other cul-de- 
sac rooms and to the larger cham- 
ber from which they had entered it. 

When they had exhausted all 
possibilities Heller flashed hawkish 
eyes over Verrons’ sketch pad. He 
compared it with the companion 
map Verrons had rendered of the 
surface features of the complex. “If 
you have proportioned these maps 
correctly, there is an entire under- 
ground area we are unable to 
reach, Commander.” 

“Where else do you think they 
put the flute dispensing mechanism 
and related storage?” 

“Ah — of course. But presumably 
there is entry to those chambers, 
through apparently we won’t dis- 
cover it here.” His eyes flashed over 
their surroundings. “What do you 
think of all this, Commander?” 
“Very pretty.” 

“And totally useless. There is 
nothing of practical usage here and 
nothing suggesting or depicting 
day-to-day life. Nothing to tell us 
more than that the people who as- 
sembled this collection included 
some very gifted artists and crafts- 
men. Have you any idea why the 
collection should be so limited?” 

“1 haven’t given it thought.” 



72 



GALAXY 



“It is limited, obviously, because 
it is only intended as a brief con- 
crete sampling of their abilities. 
The rest we are intended to learn 
through the flutes.” 

Verrons shrugged. “Granted.” 
“Then you don’t intend to ob- 
struct us from coming to the com- 
plex as a group tonight? The 
experience obviously did you and 
Winchell no harm.” 

Shrugging again, Verrons abdi- 
cated sole proprietorship of flutes. 

“And now that you’ve inspected 
this area, you won’t object to my 
sending a party down tomorrow to 
photograph and catalogue.” 

“Not if we make it out in good 
shape.” 

“As we shall.” 

Ladders were strategically placed 
When they set foot to rung, the ceil- 
ing produced passage. They mount- 
ed and emerged. 

I t was dark when Verrons woke 
again, anticipation a heady 
surge in his blood. Sitting, he un- 
cased his flute and stroked its cool 
barrel, briefly victim of temptation 
to breathe life to it here and now. 
But this was not the place. 

Nor, he decided when the party 
reached the mesa top, was the 
grand temple. Not tonight. The re- 
mainder of the party trekked there, 
footsteps hushed on shimmering 
stone. They single-filed into the 
structure, spread along the walls 
and sat, silent, hesitant. Flutes 
were distributed from cases — they 



had drawn a second case to replace 
the flutes taken by the aborigines — 
and came self-consciously to pale 
lips. 

And Verrons didn’t want to 
share light with them. He slipped 
from the temple as the first tenta- 
tive notes sounded. Quickly he 
loped down stone steps. He took 
her to a small temple that bore twin 
moons in its arched window. Hands 
quivering, he brought flute to lips. 
He tongued the mouthpiece, drew 
breath and blew. 

And nothing happened, nothing 
beyond a faint haze that draped 
dolorously in the air. Disconcerted, 
Verrons blew again, his fingers 
picking out a simple tune no one 
had ever heard before. 

No one heard it now. No one but 
Verrons squatting alone in the chill 
temple, his lips suddenly cold, twin 
moons gliding icily across his 
glazed retinas. 

Did she demand the company of 
her kind? Verrons thought not. But 
when the hands of his chrono 
measured a leaden quarter hour 
and his breath produced nothing 
but mist, he creaked to his feet and 
measured tread to the grand 
temple. 

On another night the hypnotic 
tumult of light might have claimed 
his awareness. Around the walls of 
the temple humans and aborigines 
squatted will-less, glazed eyes re- 
flecting radiant chaos. But Verrons 
was not dazzled. Stiffly he sat. 
Muscles clenched in anticipatory 



DEATHSONG 



73 



agony, he placed his own flute to 
lips and blew. 

She did not materialize. There 
was only the limp curtain of light he 
had blown in the lesser temple, for- 
lorn, barren. 

Later he barely remembered his 
staggering journey back across the 
complex, his perilous descent of the 
gully. In his own tent, by lamp- 
light, he found the flute’s seams. 

A complexity of miniature ele- 
ments occupied the metal barrel: 
ceramic units, gleaming wires — 
and a single white crystal, half as 
large as the first segment of his 
little finger, at its depths, a golden 
speck. His dancer. But the crystal 
was shot with fracture lines. When 
he probed it splintered. 

Shattered. Verrons shook bright 
shards into his palm, loss claiming 
him. A soulprint etched in crystal — 
an electrophysical expression of the 
personality, captured at the mo- 
ment of death and preserved — but 
in a medium fatally fragile. He had 
resurrected her to dance a single 
night. Exhausted, he had dropped 
her to the pavement. The clatter of 
flute on stone echoed in his mind. 

He closed his hand around sharp 
fragments. Verrons left his tent and 
slipped into the night jungle. The 
sound of flutes from the mesa laced 
the night. He emerged at stream- 
side, the smell of mud thick in his 
nostrils. 

I flew with sparks in my hair and 
between my eyes I wore a jewel that 
caught sunlight and made it a 



cleaving sword. Now she cried to 
light the upper atmosphere with a 
final crystalline surge. It was gross 
injustice to lay her to rest in the 
jungle. 

Then he saw the shimmer of twin 
moons on the surface of the stream. 
His body tightened. With a flick of 
his wrist, he committed her to rest. 
She broke silvered water lightly. 
Twin disks rippled briefly and she 
was gone. 

Gone from the night, gone from 
the world. Verrons moved through 
an empty jungle to a barren tent. 
He lay staring at an inner play of 
light, his hands clenched tightly on 
nothing. 

I t was dawn when sounds waken- 
ed him. He hurried to the dining 
area. The party had returned. With 
single-minded voracity they attack- 
ed the food supplies, pulling out 
bags of concentrate, scooping up 
powder and pellets with bare 
hands. Balsky had hauled a bag of 
carbo-powder to the shadow of the 
supply tent and was systematically 
packing his mouth. 

Verrons located Heller at the 
other side of the tent, crouched 
with the five aborigines, spilling 
hi-pro pellets into mess bowls. 
“You’re feeding them?” 

Heller’s head bobbed up, fea- 
tures haggard. “They’re starving. 
Commander. Feeding them could 
stimulate them to communicate.” 
“Then 1 hope you’re prepared to 
communicate fast. Professor. 



74 



GALAXY 



You’re probably poisoning them.” 

Heller’s glance flickered across 
the aborigines in quick alarm. 
“I — ” He jabbed at his hairline dis- 
tractedly. ”1 hadn’t thought of 
that. Their metabolisms may not be 
comparable to ours at all. I — ” His 
hand quivered. “I saw opportunity. 

I—” 

“Well, don’t stop now. This may 
be your last chance.” 

Heller bobbed up nervously. 
“Nevins is my communications 
major. Nevins — ” His gaze jerked 
back to the aborigines. They by- 
passed the mess bowls and upended 
the bag of pellets on the ground. 
Greedily forked hands scooped. 
The largest aborigine launched 
himself face first at the pile of 
pellets, lip veil switching. 

Verrons yelped for Nevins. Heller 
and Nevins initiated a valiant effort 
involving the humanoid universals, 
hand language, body language and 
finally slashing in the moist soil 
with finger and pointed stick. 
“Paper would only confuse them,” 
Nevins informed Verrons hastily. 
“Never employ a medium more 
sophisticated then the cultural level 
of the subject.” 

“In this case, language,” Ver- 
rons suggested dryly. The response 
to Nevins’ effort was unencourag- 
ing. The aborigines continued to 
feed, scrabbling after elusive 
pellets, then upending mess bowls 
over horn-lined mouths. 

By the time bowls were empty the 
effort had attracted an audience. 



“Commander, what about the sub- 
stance we used night before last?” 
Balsky suggested. 

"Did ion? Want to test another 
brand of poison, Heller?” 

Heller acceded immediately. 
“Then don’t dole out more 
calories. If the didion takes, let’s 
establish the condition that food is 
contingent upon communication. 
That will give us a lever,” 

The aborigines accepted the pale 
liquid readily, sniffing in turn from 
the vaporizing lid. Dull eyes took 
gleam almost immediately. 

“It’s working,” Heller crowed. 
“Their brain tissues — ” 

“ — are still computing food,” 
Verrons snapped as the first abo- 
rigine barreled past him, lunging 
for the supply tent. He fielded the 
attempt and found himself wrest- 
ling a bony fury. The aborigine 
grunted fiercely, joints flexing in 
unanticipated directions. Fingers 
grappled for Verrons’ windpipe. A 
horn-lined mouth affixed itself to 
Verrons’ left cheek. “Stun him!” 
Verrons bellowed. 

The other aborigines had broken 
the line of startled humans and tore 
into the supply tent. Their per- 
formance commanded more atten- 
tion than Verrons’ plight. “Drop 
him!” 

Winchell seized the weapon from 
Heller’s belt and fired around the 
frozen professor. The aborigine 
yelped and slackened. Tearing one 
arm free, Verrons pulled his own 
stunner and rendered the abo limp. 



DEATHSONG 



75 



Hand on bloodied cheek, he bound- 
ed to the supply tent to drop the re- 
maining four. 

“There is intelligence there,” 
Heller insisted, eyes blazing, as 
Verrons ordered the five lax bodies 
dragged beyond camp. 

“There’s hunger there. Even a 
dog can find food if he’s hungry 
enough.” 

“But a dog doesn’t bear human- 
oid form! A dog — ” 

It was not the moment to explore 
cosmic implications. “If you want 
to try again when they unnumb, 
fetch a bag of pellets — one. And I 
want stunners at hand. These 
pretties have just popped up the 
scale from presumed harmless to 
potentially deadly. I don’t want to 
drop the ‘potentially.’” 

T he aborigines tossed off the 
stunner effect quickly. Nevins 
labored earnestly to convey the con- 
nection between the single bag of 
pellets and the humans’ desire for 
communication. The aborigines re- 
sponded by launching attack, bat- 
tering the young assistant savagely. 

When they were felled again, 
Verrons regarded the five lax 
bodies grimly. “I think we start 
from the top again, Heller, first 
getting across the connection be- 
tween their aggressive tactics and 
all-all-down. Then we move on to 
food-comm unication . ' ’ 

Heller nodded haggardly. “Per- 
haps the didion stimulated aggres- 
sive instincts rather than true in- 



telligence,” he admitted. 

“And maybe when you’re starv- 
ing, aggression is the intelligent re- 
sponse.” 

But when the aborigines revived, 
the effects of didion had visibly 
ebbed. They huddled, gazes mov- 
ing sullenly from stunners to 
pellets, lip veils fluttering. The 
largest took his feet, head lowered. 
Verrons’ hand tightened on his 
stunner. But instead of lunging, the 
abo turned. His group followed him 
into the jungle, stalks crackling 
underfoot. 

Heller was crestfallen. Verrons 
holstered his stunner. “They’ll be 
back. So I’ll keep guard over the 
supplies while the rest of you sleep 
off the big night.” Turning, Ver- 
rons noted for the first time the ex- 
haustion of professors and students 
alike. 

His sympathy evaporated when 
he confronted the mess he was com- 
mitted to guarding. Boxes and bags 
had been torn open, powders, pel- 
lets, wafers and grains scattered 
across every surface, including the 
ground. Grimly Verrons policed 
the area, salvaging what he could. 
When the place was tidied he 
settled in for a long dull day, 
stunner at hand. Shadows moved 
silently, stalks bending in the light 
breeze, green and scarlet leaves 
rippling. The aborigines did not 
return. 

Not until dusk, when Arguilar 
summoned Verrons to the edge of 
camp. The aborigines emerged 



76 



GALAXY 



from the jungle in a group, lip veils 
switching. The tallest thrust his 
hands at Verrons. 

Verrons stared at the object 
foisted upon him. It was a small 
sturdy metal barrel, both ends 
open, its interior surface set with 
lightweight metal paddles. Sus- 
pended at its center was a round in- 
strument face marked with needled 
dials. The metal of the barrels was 
lightly pitted, the clear face of the 
instrument pack completely un- 
marked. 

The aborigine gestured at the ob- 
ject and grunted, 

“Trade?” Verrons guessed, star- 
tled. He jabbed at his mouth. 

The aborigine did likewise, lip 
veil wagging sharply. 

“Fetch a bag of hi-pro pellets,” 
Verrons ordered Arguilar quickly. 
“Snack wafers too. And Heller if 
he’s close.” 

Arguilar returned with all three. 
“They brought this? What is it?” 
Heller demanded. 

Verrons thrust it at him. “Your 
guess. Ari, keep my stunner ready.” 
He tossed the weapon to the 
assistant and breached the bag of 
pellets. 

The aborigines dined with gusto, 
pouring out the pellets in a heap 
and scooping them up. They 
sampled the wafers and dispatched 
them enthusiastically. 

“Offhand, I believe it’s a weather 
instrument. Commander. An ane- 
nometer.” Heller held it up. Dial 
hands moved as the paddles caught 



the breeze and rotated within the 
barrel. 

“Sophisticated offering from this 
crew. And in excellent condition.” 
“Exactly. It’s apparent from this 
that there are stores of artifacts we 
know nothing of, items that have 
been in sheltered storage since the 
holocaust.” 

V 

'*terrons nodded abstractedly. 

ffThe survey crew had reported 
total destruction of population cen- 
ters. Not even minimal debris re- 
mained. They had not, however, 
combed dense jungle over the entire 
face of the planet. Verrons glanced 
up at the darkening sky. “You’re 
planning to take the party to the 
complex tonight?” 

“Assuredly. While we all under- 
went vivid experiences last night, 
we learned absolutely nothing of 
the technology, nothing of how 
these people achieved their effects.” 
“I don’t think it was technology. 
The power was inborn.” 

“But the crystal set between the 
eyes was not. Nor the ones like you 
tell me you found in your flute. And 
if we can simply learn to record the 
personality for future reference, it 
will be a tremendous step forward. 
Can you imagine being able to walk 
with Socrates? To follow Newton 
and Einstein, Leakey and Pardini 
through their life’s work? Can you 
imagine looking over Shakespeare’s 
shoulder as he — ” 



DEATHSONG 



77 



“Shakespeare is already dead. 
But I see your point. So uphill we 
go and tomorrow I’ll try to per- 
suade our friends to fetch more 
trade booty. But this time I’ll follow 
them.” 

That night, when the party 
emerged from the gully, Olsen drew 
him aside. She pressed her flute 
into his hand. “I’m not going to use 
this again. But I think — I think you 
should, Commander.” 

Before he could question her she 
darted ahead like a person who has 
fulfilled a distasteful duty. Puzzled, 
Verrons examined the flute. 

Winchell fell into step beside 
him. He indicated the clutch of 
aborigines trailing the party. 
“Commander, I’ve queried the 
entire party this afternoon. No one 
caught sight of their race in the 
visions last night.” 

“Oh?” 

“In fact, I’ve quizzed almost 
everyone on their experiences. You 
know, the people who were born 
with the power certainly don’t seem 
to have developed scruples to 
match. There were some instances 
of really sophisticated brutality and 
a lot of the other — callousness, un- 
conscious brutality. Evidently they 
didn’t consider the ones who were 
born without power as truly — 
human?” 

“Little people who scuttled and 
served?’’ Verrons frowned. Cer- 
tainly the quality of mercy had not 
been strained in his own golden 
dancer. She had exhibited little em- 



pathy for her inferiors. "Well, 
mark it one sign of intelligence then 
that the abos avoided contact.” 
Winchell nodded. “I guess so. 
You know, the abos might even 
have developed into an intelligent 
race. If they’d lasted long enough.” 
Verrons’ sympathies were not en- 
gaged. “If the spark had been there 
they would have hung on.” 

“But the others didn’t, the light- 
dancers and their underpeople.” 
Verrons grunted. “And no one 
caught a hint of what happened to 
them?” 

Winchell’s clear eyes flickered 
away. “I— I’m not sure. Olsen 
wouldn’t talk to me. But none of 
the others caught anything.” 
“Well, we’ll see.” 



H e said that without suspecting 
he shortly would see, when he 
braced himself against the temple 
wall, put Olsen’s flute to mouth 
and breathed a burning red being 
into life. For with that fiery vision 
he breathed more than another 
surging light-dancer. He breathed 
another time, another circum- 
stance, when the scuttling little 
people had become the preponder- 
ant mass of the population, when 
the sparking manes of power had 
grown few. 

Too few. And in our sparse num- 
bers , we maintained our rule. The 
weak, the powerless, still they 
cringed before our swords of light. 
But we saw that in too few genera- 



78 



GALAXY 



tions we would be not just extinct 
but dishonored. We saw that when 
the last of us died the underpeople 
would cease to give our ancestors 
life-of-sight with their breath. In- 
stead they would viciously destroy 
the flutes that are our immortality. 
We would perish in our crystalline 
shells, victims of the genetic whim- 
sy that has rendered our offspring 
too few to continue our kind. 

We would be lost to the uni- 
verse — the universe that is ours! 

But the remaining elite knew 
they were not alone in that uni- 
verse. They looked up and they 
speculated. Somewhere was other 
life, life similar to their own. For — 
arrogantly — wasn’t the human form 
the most efficient possible, the 
most logical? And some day that 
life, venturing, would inevitably 
find their planet. 

When it did, they would be wait- 
ing. Waiting to dance and fly, to 
flash and spiral. Waiting to relive 
their entire history, each of them 
preserved, every line represented, 
first to last. And there would be 
nothing to distract the comers from 
the waiting flutes. Nor would there 
be mutinous underpeople to destroy 
those fragile and precious instru- 
ments. 

There would be no underpeople 
at all. 

Verrons lived the first steps of 
temple construction. A site far 
from any population center was se- 
lected and the mesa raised. A stor- 
age vault to house the entire collec- 



tion of flutes — the revered ances- 
tors — was constructed, carefully 
buffered and shielded. On its inner 
walls the history of the powered 
race was inscribed, victory by vic- 
tory, glory by glory. There were no 
defeats. Nor would there be. 

Verrons was spared the final 
holocaust only by the death of his 
escort. In the interval between that 
deathhouse passage into crystal 
and the reappearance of the fiery 
wheel of light, Verrons forcibly ex- 
tracted his consciousness from the 
vision world. He jerked the flute 
from his lips, fingers cramping. 

They had destroyed the under- 
people to insure their own pre- 
carious immortality. First they had 
erected the temple complex — star 
bait — and then they had systemati- 
cally blasted and exterminated. 
Verrons didn’t have to see to know. 
In a reflex gesture, he hurled the 
flute. Die! It clattered against stone 
floor. 

But disgust was not sufficient to 
route him from the temple while 
other wheels of light flashed. Nor 
did destruction of the fiery entity 
cleanse him of ugliness. And at 
dawn he tore through the food 
stores with the others, scattering 
and wasting. Human and aborigine 
fed side by side, forked hand and 
fingered pawing greedily. 



terrons was half asleep on his 
Vcot when Olsen loomed above 
him, hesitant. “Commander — ” 



DEATHSONG 



79 



"You didn’t flute.” The words 
were thick. 

“No, I—” 

“Good. You guard the food. 
From the abs. Get me if y’have 
trouble.” 

“With the aborigines? You want 
me to — ” 

“Take m’stunner. Come get me 
if they go ’way.” He lapsed into 
semi-consciousness. 

Sometime later she reappeared. 
“Commander, the aborigines — I 
didn’t let them at the food stocks. I 
stunned them. Now they’ve gone 
into the jungle.” 

Verrons sat and peered muzzily 
at the dial of his chrono. Midday. 
“Going for trade goods?” 

“I don’t know. I — do you want 
me to follow them and find out? By 
myself?” 

Verrons managed to wag an em- 
phatic negative. “Med kit,” he de- 
manded gruffly. The inside of his 
head had congealed. 

Ten minutes later, stimulants at 
work, he stepped from the tent and 
swayed lightly in the noonday 
breeze. Olsen led him into the 
jungle. “They have a quarter-hour 
start now.” 

“They travel like turtles.” And a 
little like elephants too. Fortunate- 
ly his mind cleared and his legs 
steadied. Verrons found the abo- 
rigines’ trail quickly, followed it 
easily, Olsen in his wake. 

“Commander — ” 

“We can't gab and sneak simul- 
taneously.” 



“Oh.” Evidently what she had 
meant to say was not urgent. 

Neither was the aborigines’ pace 
through the jungle. They crossed 
the stream and led Verrons and Ol- 
sen away from the temple complex. 
Soon the two humans drew near 
enough to hear the tread of feet. 
“We’d better stay well behind,” 
Verrons whispered hoarsely. 

“Commander, the flute I gave 
you — ” 

Verrons’ jaw tightened. “I de- 
stroyed it.” The answering flicker 
in Olsen’s pale eyes told him the 
impulse had touched her, too. He 
glanced at his chrono, rubbing his 
stomach. “We should have packed 
lunch.” 

“Because the flutes make us 
hungry,” she hissed. 

“They — ” Verrons halted. He 
stared at her, his stomach convuls- 
ing in fresh hunger. 

“All that light and motion — it’s 
our energy that powers it,” she said 
vehemently. “Those crystals draw 
directly from us." 

Verrons pulled himself very 
straight, digesting her words. The 
stumbling fatigue, the voracious 
hunger, the dizzy faintness — none 
were simply the result of late nights 
and irregular hours. He suffered all 
the sympatoms of an exhausted 
power cell. “Olsen, how do you al- 
ways hit just the right nail?” 

“By being fairly bright,” she shot 
back with asperity. “And by know- 
ing when I’m being used.” 

As he should have known him- 



80 



GALAXY 



self. As he would have known, 
given a few more days, a few more 
fainting spells. But the aborigines 
were moving ahead. “We’ll talk 
about this when we get back to 
camp. At length.” 

She nodded grim satisfaction. 
They moved forward . 

As they moved into dense vege- 
tation beyond the stream the abo- 
rigines’ pace quickened. They 
stopped twice to feed, pulling down 
branches heavy with yellow berries 
and gorging. Verrons and Olsen 
watched from cover of damp foli- 
age, Verrons’ stomach clenching 
enviously. “If we dared touch 
native vegetation — ” 

Olsen glanced at him sharply. 
“If we dared,” he concluded, 
settling back. 

When they continued, he travel- 
ed with stunner at hand, seeking 
bending stalks and swaying sha- 
dows alertly. Underfoot the soil was 
damp and black, rich with decay. 

It was late afternoon when the 
jungle march halted. Ahead, the 
aborigines’ heavy tread was si- 
lenced. Verrons and Olsen waited, 
then moved forward vigilantly. 

ahead a small dome sat on the 
jungle floor, partly overgrown 
with vine. Its door stood open. 
From its interior Verrons heard the 
unmistakable grunts of their 
humanoid guides. And beyond the 
first dome were others of similar 
size and construction, lower panels 



translucent brown, upper panels 
transparent green. 

Cautiously Verrons edged past 
the first dome and around the first 
of the second rank. He tapped 
translucent paneling lightly. It was 
a plastic material, virtually un- 
touched by deterioration. He 
pressed his forehead to transparent 
paneling. Within the dome he 
could see only dim immobile 
shapes. 

Olsen’s features were as bemused 
as his own. Then, glancing away, 
she touched Verrons' arm and 
pointed. Through dense vegetation, 
he spotted a second cluster of 
domes. He flared a look back at the 
structure the aborigines had enter- 
ed. Quickly he slipped the stunner 
from Olsen's belt and popped it 
into her hands. “Keep an eye on 
them. If they head back toward 
camp, join me.” A motion of his 
hand indicated the dome cluster 
ahead. He- dodged away. 

The second cluster was more 
extensive than the first and more 
varied. It included a single long- 
house, several small domes and a 
half-dozen larger ones. Again the 
exterior paneling, although assault- 
ed by vine, was unmarked by deter- 
ioration. Verrons pushed through a 
hinged door into the longhouse. 

The interior held deserted still- 
ness — and chaos. And even by the 
limited light that filtered through 
transparent green paneling, Ver- 
rons recognized the nature of this 
particular chaos. Containers large 



DEATHSONG 



81 



and small were littered and strewn, 
the floor and every surface of the 
structure were stained and caked 
with dried smears. Verrons forded 
the length of the structure, recog- 
nizing other things too — tables, 
chairs, cook units, water tanks — all 
of alien design, but recognizable in 
their function, granted a humanoid 
context. He had found a cook- 
shack — a devastated one. 

Devastated like the supply tent 
he had policed yesterday morning, 
devastated by a raging localized 
storm of hunger. Pulling at a cabi- 
net door, he found stacked plastic 
mess trays. Their fastidious ar- 
rangement was ironic counterpoint 
to the unmannered chaos around 
him. 

Disturbed, he emerged at the far 
end of the cookshack and entered 
one of the larger circular domes. 
Again light was dim but contents 
were recognizable: cots, tables, 
chairs, chests, miscellany. But this 
time everything was in fair order. 

He was sifting miscellany when 
Olsen found him. “They’ve headed 
back toward camp.” 

His head snapped up. “Taking 
what?” 

“Another weather instrument, I 
think. I examined the structure 
they emerged from before coming 
for you. It’s evidently a storage 
shed for weather instruments and 
meteorological supplies. None of 
them are exactly like anything I 
handled when I took Instruments, 
but they’re close enough. And there 



are logs, too. Not very extensive — 
lots of empty pages. I couldn’t read 
the script, of course, or the num- 
bering system — ” 

“Just as I can’t read this,” 
Verrons interrupted. The item he 
thrust at her consisted of long limp 
plastic pages bound with adhesive. 
They were covered with an incom- 
prehensible interlacing of line and 
curve. “As bad as my own hand- 
writing.” 

Her eyes flickered down the limp 
page. “Meaning we’re dealing with 
someone who has hands? Like our 
aborigines?” 

He nodded. He indicated the fur- 
nishings of the dome. "And some- 
one who has arms and legs and tor- 
sos and probably heads — like our 
aborigines. Or some other human- 
oid race.” 

“There were only two humanoid 
races on this world,” she reminded 
him, “unless you want to sub-clas- 
sify the underpeople as a separate 
race.” 

“But they’ve been dead for 
several centuries. Totally dead. 
And this cluster of domes hasn’t 
been here more than a few years.” 

“The aborigines then?” 

T he suggestion was ludicrous. 

“I’m not too surprised the sur- 
vey boys missed this. It’s well camo- 
flauged, green and brown sunk in 
jungle growth. And it’s far enough 
from the temple complex that the 
area wasn’t intensively surveyed be- 



82 



GALAXY 



yond overflight with animal-life 
sensors. After all, the survey crew 
had less than a month to spend on 
the entire globe. 

“But our light-dancers ruled — 
and flew — this world for centuries. 
If the abos were coming up the evo- 
lutionary scale anywhere near 
creating this sophisticated a layout, 
they would have known about it. 
Yet we didn’t sight the abos 
through any of the fourteen or so 
flutes we sampled. The one you and 
I shared was the most recent and he 
certainly had no knowledge of a 
second intelligent race sharing this 
world.” 

She nodded thoughtfully. “Then 
there is one other possibility.” 

“Right. The race that created 
this outpost came from offworld, as 
we did.” 

“So this has to be just that — an 
outpost.” 

“And I suggest we paw around 
some more before we carry specula- 
tion farther.” 

She agreed. They tackled mis- 
cellany together. 

Five minutes later they had their 
key. Verrons spread it on a table 
and they bent over it together. 
Heavy silence stretched between 
them. 

“A photo album,” Olsen said 
finally, softly. 

“Of the folks back home.” The 
faces that looked up at him from 
printed plastic pages were familiar: 
bifurcate nostrils, round oral ori- 
fices, fleshy violet veils cascading 



from the lower lip arcs. The forked 
hands were familiar too. The phy- 
siques might have been, starved of 
fat and muscle tissue, bared of 
gowns, robes, trousers and brilliant 
swathings, the flesh smeared in- 
stead with mud. Verrons flicked 
quickly through the volume. Their 
‘aborigines’ appeared against the 
technological background of some 
unidentifiable other world, patron- 
masters of science and the ma- 
chine. Even though they could not 
decipher the script that covered the 
page backs, Verrons and Olsen 
read substantially from the photo 
presentation. 

When they had reached the last 
page, they slapped the album shut 
and gazed at each other. “They 
were either surveying this place or 
actually settling it,” Verrons said 
finally. “A quick look around 
should tell us. And a bedcount 
should tell us how many of them 
there were originally.” 

Olsen nodded somberly. 

The original party had consisted, 
they soon determined, of better 
than four dozen members. And 
they had come equipped to farm. 
Verrons even located their seed 
storage. Bags and cartons had been 
untidily opened and thrown about. 
“Presumably the seed was never 
planted,” he said, prying a single 
flat green seed from a crevice in the 
flooring. “Probably just devoured 
when the kitchen stocks ran out.” 

“Surely they brought some sur- 
plus food supplies,” Olsen said. 



DEATHSONG

“Enough to carry them a season or 
two if their first crops didn’t do 
well.” 

“But flutes make hungry. And 
that’s not all. Flutes make sleepy, 
dizzy, dull — ” 

“Dead,” Olsen finished tersely. 
“Especially since they were finally' 
left to live off the land. Which ob- 
viously supplies them nothing like a 
balanced or adequate diet for their 
species. Do you think — if our sup- 
plies will stretch to feed them — they 
have any chance of recovery? Of 
actually going ahead with their 
settlement?” 

Verrons shrugged. “Who knows? 
If there’s been no substantial brain 
damage, if both sexes are repre- 
sented, provided that’s necessary, if 
we could find a few more stray 
seed-if, if, if.” He glanced up. 
Dusk eased across the face of the 
’jungle. “Are you game to trek back 
by moonlight?” 



sen was game. Rolling the 
photo album and tucking it in- 
to a pocket, Verrons led way, 
stunner in hand, eyes watchful. 

“The light-dancers used them 
like disposable power packs. That’s 
how they used their underpeople 
and that’s how they’re using us too, 
Commander,” Olsen said grimly. 
“We’ll exhaust our supplies prema- 
turely and we certainly won’t do the 
work we came to do. You can see 
disorganization creeping in al- 
ready.” 



“I can — now. But you and I 
know something the other members 
of our party don’t.” 

“Oh? We’ll tell them, won’t we? 
When we get back?” 

“No, I mean something else. We 
know a lot about the structure of 
the underground flute storage 
chambers. We know, for instance, 
that the substructure area was care- 
fully engineered so the flutes would 
not be endangered when the popu- 
lation centers were bombed.” 

She stared at him blankly. 

“That means — conversely — that 
if we deliver an explosive to the 
storage area the force of the ex- 
plosion will be absorbed there with- 
out seriously damaging the terrain 
around camp — or even, probably, 
the mesa and the temple complex.” 
Olsen brightened. She flicked 
back pale hair. “We have explo- 
sives, Commander.” 

“We sure do.” He stared down at 
his hand. Two nights ago it had 
cradled his golden dancer’s acci- 
dentally shattered crystal. Last 
night it had deliberately terminated 
the fiery dancer’s immortality. 
Now, he vowed, that hand would 
operate on a grander scale. 

When they reached camp, pole 
lamps glowed spottily, a few light- 
ed, most dark. The supply tent was 
in a state of devastation. From the 
mesa flutes sounded, melody of 
night, drunken, disorganized. 
Dying. 

“We’ll have to wait till light,” 
Verrons reminded Olsen. “Can’t

take the chance of collapsing the 
grand temple on Heller’s head. 
Think you can slip uphill and 
snatch a couple of flute cases with- 
out disturbing our dreamers? And 
without falling under the spell your- 
self?” His mood was suddenly 
euphoric. 

“Why do you keep asking if I can 
deliver?” she jibed, disappearing 
into darkness. 

Why indeed? By the time he had 
extracted the explosive from stor- 
age, studied the use manual, calcu- 
lated and measured, she had re- 
turned with two empty flute cases. 
He glanced up sharply, almost ex- 
pecting to see the dazzle of light re- 
flected in her eyes. 

Instead he saw purpose. “What 
are we going to do about the flutes 
they have with them, Com- 
mander?” 

“You’re ready to launch a real 
vendetta, aren’t you?” 

She bared small white teeth. “I’ll 
settle for total destruction.” 

He nodded. They had shared 
more than one tempering experi- 
ence in the past two days. “You 
don't think we should leave Heller 
one or two flutes? For research pur- 
poses?” 

There was no ambivalence in her 
expression. ‘‘No, I don’t. Why 
should we be any more compassion- 
ate than they were?” 

But Olsen had never entertained 
a golden dancer. She had never 
mated in the clouds, even if only vi- 
cariously. Her red dancer had been 



too busy with weighty affairs to 
skim the morning sky, to dance the 
rainbow. He had shown her only 
the coldly brutal side of his race. 

Verrons’ golden dancer had 
shown him more. His hands quiver- 
ed as he packed the two flute cases 
and fused the contents. ‘‘Now. 
Think you can sleep?” 

She wagged her head emphati- 
cally. “No.” 

He didn’t think he could either. 
But neither of them kept death 
watch that night. Within the hour 
both were flung across cots — she 
brought hers from her tent — 
asleep. 



T ent panels lightened with dawn. 

Verrons awoke. He sat stiffly 
and gazed down at his partner in 
destruction. She was less fearsome 
in sleep. She looked, in fact, as if 
she could be disregarded if he 
changed his mind and returned the 
explosive to its container, the flute 
cases to Heller. She looked less 
compelling than a vision that bran- 
dished green light like a sword. 

Until she opened her eyes. 
“They’re back.” A quick motion 
brought her to her feet, flute case in 
hand. 

Supply tent revels rang from the 
opposite end of camp as they 
slipped into the dawn jungle. For- 
tunately they met no stragglers. 
They fleeted dense shadow and 
mounted the gully. 

At the top, when they stepped to 



DEATHSONG 



85 



glistening pink stone, even Olsen 
softened. “Just in case, I want to 
have a last look at the grand 
dome.” 

“You don’t trust our red man to 
have engineered the substructure 
adequately?” 

She tossed off a wry gesture. 
“I’ve been dreaming explosions. 
So — just in case, I’m going to have 
a look.” 

Just in case, he accompanied 
her. 

Their attention was distracted 
from architecture by the single lax 
body that sprawled on the stone 
floor beneath the grand dome. Ver- 
rons bent quickly. It was Heller, his 
flute still clutched tight in protec- 
tive fingers. Verrons placed ear to 
chest. “He’s alive — just uncon- 
scious.” 

“And they were too brute-dumb- 
hungry to revive him and get him 
back to camp,” Olsen said indig- 
nantly. “Now we’ll have to do it. 
We’ll have to drag him down the 
gully with us after we — ” 

But her indignation buzzed in 
Verrons’ ears like the diatribe of a 
bee, furious, futile. His knees 
buckled and he sat on the cold 
stone floor, suddenly shaking with 
hysterical glee. Some mad-dog 
bomb squad they mad, the grizzled 
Service veteran and the freckled - 
faced coed. He laughed gustily, 
tears coming to his eyes. When he 
regained control, he demanded 
hoarsely, “What are we going to 
use for bodies, killer?” 



Olsen didn’t see cause for risi- 
bility. “Bodies?” Coldly. 

“We’re going to drop our explo- 
sives down the dispensing blocks, 
aren’t we? And make boom?” 

“We are.” 

“Well, it takes six bodies to per- 
suade the stone to open its mouth, 
Olsen. 1 count three here, one we’ll 
have to drag, the other two sound 
enough physically but a little mush- 
headed. Don’t you think?” 

Slowly Olsen sat, her mouth sag- 
ging. “1 forgot. All our plans, so 
much happening — ” She shook her 
head. But her demoralization was 
brief. Her slight features cleared 
and she jumped up again, jabbing 
a forefinger at the unconscious pro- 
fessor. “He stumbled and broke his 
ankle, Commander, coming out of 
the grand temple. We’ll need help 
to get him down the gully to 
camp.” 

Verrons’ brows flickered up in 
admiration. “You’re right. We’ll 
need at least three strong young 
bodies. Winchell for starts. The 
other two I’ll leave to your discre- 
tion.” 



S he was off again. Verrons stood, 
prying the Bute from Heller’s 
clenched fingers. He examined the 
instrument, then zippered it into a 
tool pocket. The professor he 
dragged toward the temple where 
Olsen had agreed to bring her 
party. 

As they crossed the plaza, early 



86 



GALAXY 



sunlight touched Heller’s eyes. 
They opened and stared, un- 
focused. “Professor? feel like 
walking?” Verrons probed gently. 

“Ngwf.” 

By the time they reached the 
small temple, Heller was able to 
focus his eyes, somewhat. Life re- 
turned to his limbs. They moved, if 
uncoordinatedly. His response to 
Verrons’ cautiously phrased queries 
were more forceful. Verrons squat- 
ted, forcing himself to watch 
Heller’s weak struggles with a clini- 
cal eye. Over a period of two years, 
three, four at most, the flutes had 
transformed a party of fifty-two 
vigorous and enterprising settlers 
into a clutch of five naked starving 
brutes. Verrons juggled fancy ter- 
minology: tissue starvation, brain 
damage, terminal malnutrition. 

The flutes would wreak the same 
damage to the human party if un- 
checked. The light-dancers had de- 
stroyed their own mother race and 
they would destroy any other hu- 
manoid race that walked into their 
glistening trap. Because their own 
flashy survival was all they had 
considered of significance. Verrons 
stroked explosive flute cases. - 

Then he heard human voices 
echoing across the stone plaza. 
When they drew near, he activated 
the fuse timers and jumped up, 
both cases in hand. 

Olsen led Winchell, Waller and 
Balsky into the temple. “The pro- 
fessor insisted on coming.” She in- 
dicated the bag on her back. “And 



I picked up the rest of the flutes 
lying around the supply and dihing 
area.” Her jaw squared vengefully. 
“No one thought to ask about 
stretcher or splints.” 

That Verrons could believe. It 
was a rumpled and stuporous crew 
she had assembled, heads listing, 
shoulders sagging, eyes vacant. 

But this wasn't the occasion for 
parade call. Their presence had 
already been noted. From the 
center of the temple floor the stone 
block rose, slowly, with inevitable 
majesty. 

With less majesty, Verrons 
darted forward. A rectangular case 
appeared from the maw of the me- 
chanism. He jammed it back into 
the hold and shoved a second case 
after it. 

The end of the block closed. 
Slowly stone reunited with floor. 
Olsen’s pale eyes flashed wildly. 
She visibly restrained herself from 
crowing. 

“Come on,” Verrons snapped, 
grabbing at Heller’s armpit. “I 
gave us fifteen minutes to lob in two 
booms and get down the gully.” 

They wrestled the lean professor 
across the plaza to the next temple, 
their three cohorts zombieing be- 
hind, eyes glazed. There, again, 
stone rose, 

“My turn,” Olsen insisted. 



and a nice job she did, Verrons 
/V. acknowledged later. A nice job 
they both did, herding their stupor-

ous colleagues across the plaza and 
into the mouth of the gully. Paus- 
ing at the edge of stone, Olsen 
wriggled the bag of flutes off her 
back. With a gesture exultant, she 
flung it over the side of the mesa. 

By the time they reached the 
bottom of the gully themselves, 
Heller was live with protest, all 
limbs indignant, eyes blazing. 
“Commander, I can travel under 
my own power. I’m no invalid. I — ” 

“Then run!” Verrons seized the 
professor's arm and propelled him 
toward the jungle. Glancing back, 
he saw that Olsen urged the other 
three into motion. 

A sharp crump halted the entire 
party. Briefly frozen, all stared 
back at the mesa. A second crump 
moved its rocky sides and lifted the 
hat briefly off the single temple 
visible above. Slowly stone settled 
back into place. The temple quiver- 
ed but held. 

Heller’s lean throat writhed and 
gave birth. “Commander, what — ” 

“We’ve killed the flutes!” Olsen 
said. 

No one believed her. All eyes 
swung to Verrons for contradiction. 
Even Winchell, Waller and Balsky 
achieved fleeting alertness. 

Verrons nodded. “We slung ex- 
plosive into the flute crypts. The 
rest of the temple complex should 
be intact — more or less — for future 
researchers. You can draw histori- 
cal data from the interior wall of 
the crypts — they’re inscribed with a 
detailed history of the race — if you 



can piece them back together and 
decipher them. You might even pin 
down the technology there — to 
whatever extent it ever existed. But 
you can forget the flutes.” 

Heller gobbled. “You’ve casu- 
ally, unilaterally, shattered the in- 
struments of the evolutionary plan? 
You’ve — ” 

“The plan is survival, Heller. 
Nothing esoteric about that. It’s the 
same on every world. Who can sur- 
vive does. Who can’t — doesn’t.” 

Heller didn’t see it that way. 
Frothing, gesticulating, he launch- 
ed verbal attack. “You cannot sub- 
vert the plan and live, Verrons. The 
plan has existed since time began. 
Not just Earth time — total time, 
consciousness time. The plan — ” 

“Then look at it this way, Heller. 
If there is a plan I’m a part of it, 
too. And I’ve just fulfilled my func- 
tion.’’ Turning, Verrons waded 
away through jungle growth, aban- 
doning them. He had only done 
what he had to. 

He had, in fact, done what he 
had to in more ways than one. His 
step quickened as he touched 
Heller's flute, still zippered secure- 
ly into his pocket. He felt confident 
it was alive. When he reached 
camp, he would hide it in his case 
and no one would know it had sur- 
vived. But one night soon Verrons 
would make his way from camp to 
some deserted spot far away and he 
would soar the clouds again. 
Patting the metal barrel, he sprint- 
ed toward camp. ★

I ast month I reported to you how 
j I toted myself bowlegged with 
a suitcase half-full of books and 
galleys and what is amusingly 
called a “portable” typewriter, 
writing when and where I could. I 
spent four days at Penn State, at 
the Fourth Annual Conference of 
the Science Fiction Research Asso- 
ciation (where Jack Williamson 
took the “Pilgrim” Award, and Dr. 
Thomas Clareson was re-elected to 
the presidency) and then was 
whisked — and I mean whisked — to 
Cornell, where with barely time to 
throw on another jacket I went to 
cocktails and dinner and the audi- 
torium, where I was introduced by 
Dr. Carl Sagan. Afterward I met 
with the Sigma Phi fraternity 
brothers who were my first and 
most cordial hosts — and then mov- 



ed for a couple of days with the 
Sagans. There was a guided tour 
through the space-and-time-wide 
environs of Sagan's part of the As- 
tronomy Department. Imagine if 
you will a single corridor in which, 
side by side, are 1) a laboratory 
containing thousands of feet of 
glass plumbing in which methane, 
ammonia, sulfur and water are be- 
ing hammered by a variety of ener- 
gies, producing organic sub- 
stances — amino acids and the 
like — and 2) right next door, a 
room full of computers in which 
mathematicians of the highest level 
are tearing away at the problem of 
black holes. Just a few steps from 
one another! 

Then there were encounters with 
the science fiction people — as I 
understand it, lacking an official

sponsor for a course, some thirty 
students are teaching themselves! I 
found them sharp-minded, inform- 
ed and responsive. Thence to a 
command appearance before some 
of the English Department, who (it 
seemed to me) had a little difficulty 
in acknowledging that myself and 
my (our) work is not totally dedi- 
cated to gears, BEMs and bad writ- 
ing. On to New York and then, at 
the weekend, to Boston and Marvin 
Minsky, head of the Artificial Intel- 
ligence Lab at M.I.T., where, with 
eighty people in his staff, he is 
attacking the problem of a machine 
that can think. I went through his 
laboratory, a wonderland of com- 
puters, two-elbowed articulated 
"waldo” arms and, by the dozens, 
fine-honed, wide-ranging, utterly 
fearless Brains. That collection of 
people has to be one of the most re- 
markable assemblages on the 
planet. 

I had the pleasure of carrying a 
message from Sagan to Minsky. 
“Say we have this Mars lander,” 
said Sagan, “and it tells us, ‘I have 
begun the descent of a thirty-degree 
slope. The visibility is near zero. 
What shall I do?’ and you send to 
it: ‘Stop already, idiot, there could 
be a 500-foot cliff ahead.’ But — it 
takes twenty minutes for us to get 
the message from Mars and twenty 
more for our word to get back to 
the lander. 

“So tell Minsky: 'Hurry up!"' 

After an unforgettable weekend 
in the Minsky manse, a great ramb- 



ling old house with a computer ter- 
minal (which proved to me that 
though many psychoanalysts may 
indeed have brains, they don’t need 
them — ask a computerman some 
time to demonstrate to you the 
program called doctor), an artifi- 
cial nightingale, a trapeze, a great 
little kid with a broken leg who was 
run over by a bicycle, his twin sister 
who says, “Daddy: Two.” “Seven,” 
he answers. “Three,” she says. He 
ponders and then says “One . .” 
They’re playing tic-tac-toe in their 
heads. And another daughter who 
was teaching math last year when 
she was fifteen — and who has a boa 
constrictor and a wonderful mother 
who knows more about children 
and public health than any three 
towns’ Town Boards. (Speaking of 
wonderful women: I forgot to men- 
tion that the art on the famous 
gold-iridium plate now being trans- 
ported into deep space by Pioneer 
10, to inform some intelligence, 
somewhere, some time — perhaps a 
billion years from now — as to who 
we are, where the ship came from; 
this art was done by the beauteous 
Linda Sagan, who never gets 
credit.) After the weekend, another 
speech and then a meeting with the 
M.I.T. S.F. Society, which owns 
the most extraordinary, the most 
complete and the most beautifully 
organized science fiction library I 
have ever seen. 

These are only a very few of the 
encounters I had on this journey 
and I wish I could share every mo-

ment of every one of them with you. 
But this is a book review, so: 

J 'hose Who Can, A Science 
Fiction Reader , edited by Robin 
Scott Wilson (Mentor, 333 pp, with 
biographical notes, $1.50) is the 
way the title goes on the title page. 
On the cover. Those Who Can is set 
in eight-point Myopia, while the 
subtitle is in second-coming capi- 
tals, which is an indication of the 
ways in which publishers’ sales de- 
partments think. Anyway, the book 
is a refutation of Shaw’s: “Those 
who can, do. Those who cannot, 
teach — ” and is brilliant. It’s an 
anthology of fine science fiction 
yarns by some of the very best in the 
business; it’s a book of essays on 
writing by writers who know what 
they are doing; it’s a book of criti- 
cism and lucid example, articulate 
and entertaining. It’s set up this 
way: Wilson, founder of the Clarion 
courses in science fiction writing, 
chose a dozen writers and asked 
them to comment on their own 
work, two each within the following 
six arbitrary sections (“. it is 
probably the worst possible way to 
go about it,” writes Wilson in his 
intro, “except for any other way I 
can think of.”): plot, character, 
theme, setting, point of view and 
style. A few words from the editor 
at the head of each section are 
followed by two stories, each 
coupled with an essay by the author 
about the story — under ‘setting’, 
for example, Joanna Russ’s fine 



The Man Who Could Not See 
Devils — then her remarks on ‘set- 
ting’ as it applies to the yarn. And 
then Silverberg’s Sundance and his 
reasons for setting it the way he 
did. Under style Fred Pohl gives us 
not one, but two of his most bril- 
liant shorts, Grandy Devil and Day 
Million, with a fine exposition of 
‘style’ as it applies to both. Damon 
Knight has done something un- 
usual and fascinating under ‘theme’ 
in having his story Masks run on 
the right-hand pages, with his 
running commentary and notes on 
the left — something I could take 
willingly by the bookful. The 
authors, besides those mentioned, 
are Williamson, Delany, Keyes, 
Ellison, Le Guin, Wilhelm, Wilson 
himself, and Gunn. Now, I learned 
at the SFRA Conference that there 
are scheduled, for 1974, about five 
hundred courses in science fiction 
in high schools and colleges — and I 
would most urgently recommend 
that every teacher and every stu- 
dent of every one of them get this 
book early and bone up on it. I 
should like to stress the fact that, 
rich as it is, the book isn’t a com- 
pendium of hard definitions and 
final answers. Far from it. It deals 
with a living, growing, changing 
thing — writing — and it deals with 
its parts in the voices of highly, and 
rightly, opinionated people, with 
many of whom I disagree. And so 
will you, I think. I wish Wilson 
would do another like this, with a 
dozen more writers. I wish someone

would set up a seminar based on 
this book. What I’m trying to say is 
that I am impressed and enlivened 
by this package. 

7 ’he Best of Fantasy and Science 
Fiction, 24th Series, edited by 
Ed Ferman (Doubleday, $5.95), 
with six gruesome delights by car- 
toonist Gahan Wilson, is a Best 
Buy, with such top-of-the-mark 
classics-to-be as Pohl’s Shaffery 
Among the Immortals and Ellison’s 
Deathbird, Poul Anderson’s shat- 
tering The Problem of Pain and 
Phyllis MacLennan’s almost equally 
poignant Thus Love Betrays Us. 
We can rejoice at the reappearance 
of Alfred Bester, with his enchant- 
ing The Animal Fair. This extraor- 
dinary talent has been too long 
away from our scene. Raylyn 
Moore has an unforgettable story 
about a frighteningly talented little 
boy and a starchy schoolteacher. 
But the one that will roll you 
around on the carpet is called 
Sooner or Later or Never Never by 
Gary Jennings. Clearly his own 
kind of writer, Jennings is the 
wildest thing to come along since 
R. A. Lafferty. 

E xcept, of course, for Geo. 

Alec Effmger, who is out of his 
mind in a totally unique fashion. 
Relatives (Harper and Row, $6.95) 
is one of those rare books with 
which you participate or you 
don’t — and if you don’t it’s a dead 
loss. Effmger deals here with reali- 



ties — note the plural — either in an 
effort to circumscribe and therefore 
describe reality itself (“our” reality 
or “the” reality) or to prove fairly 
conclusively that reality is so fluid, 
composed of so many variables, 
that perhaps the only wise course is 
to take anything real with a dose of 
salts. If the book grabs you, it will 
grab you hard — but it’s not for 
everybody. 

I can say the same about a com- 
pletely different kind of book, 
and a different kind of grab: Harry 
Harrison’s Star Smashers of the 
Galaxy Rangers (G. P. Putnam's 
Sons, $5.95.) Harrison had a ball 
with this one, a Tom Swiftian, gee- 
whiz parody of the very worst that 
our severest and most ignorant 
critics lay on us, salted with puns, 
plays-on-words and double mean- 
ings for the delectation of a fairly 
wide spectrum of “in” people. Per- 
sonally I love this kind of thing at 
short-short length. If you like it in 
large doses, here’s 180 tightly 
packed pages of it, so have fun. 

W ILLIAM JON WATKINS has 

written a novel, Clickwhistle 
(Doubleday, $4.95), which deals 
with dolphins in a way that pleases 
me. As I have so often mentioned 
before, one of the most potent chal- 
lenges ever given a writer was John 
Campbell’s: “Give me a story about 
a creature that thinks as well as a 
man but not like a man.” Watkins 
has done this very well indeed. His

is most interesting. Grafted on to 
this innately fascinating encounter 
are matters more cosmic, I think, 
than they need be, and added to the 
fact that Watkins’ prose tends to be 
dense and unleavened from time to 
time, the book is a little uphill to 
read. I hope to see more of this 
writer. 

Next month, perhaps a little late, 
I’ll get into a real find, a book 
called Joshua, Son of None, by 
Nancy Freedman. And then a take- 
out on a new small explosion in a 
very important area: science fiction 
children's books. 



and quite by the way: something I 
learned on my recent travels. 
If you begin to hear of an upsurge 
of UFO reports, it is not because 
the phenomena have suddenly in- 
creased. It’s because the computers 
which analyze sky sightings gener- 
ally have until very recently been 
programed to disregard and not re- 
port anything that is not in orbit or 
on a ballistic course — matters they 
can ascertain in hundredths of a 
second. The very thing that makes 
the UFOs so perplexing — that they 
follow neither orbital nor ballistic 
tracks — has disqualified them from 
notice! But you’ll begin to hear 
about them more, because of a de- 
velopment called MERV. I think 
I’d rather be alive now than in any 
period in human history.

RIVERS OF 
DAMASCUS 



R. A. LAFFERTY 
I 

T he caravan clowns came to 
town about four times a year, 
usually in the service of a caravan, 
sometimes not. They came now to 
the town (the oldest in the world) 
out of service and with no clear 
purpose. They were strictly on a 
bold-bashful skylark. There were a 
few less than a hundred of them. 
They were slight, smiling, shy, 
desert Arabs. The guards of the 
city, though they usually treated 
the clowns with a lowering sort of 
theatrical harshness, really liked 
them — but especially they liked to 
devil them. 

The desert gamins, first leaving 
long and rickety constructs of some 
sort at a little distance on the sand, 
came into the city by the east gate, 
whence the street named Straight 
(the Latins called it Via Recta and 



96 



the Arabs Souk-el-Taouil) runs 
west to the heart of the city. They 
came in one by one sideways as 
though it were a narrow way, 
though the gate was high, wide and 
completely open. This was in the 
month of March of the Year of 
Restored Salvation 635. 

“Thieves, coney-eaters, camel- 
suckers, trench-straddlers, good- 
for-nothings — what do you want in 
our town?” several of the tall town 
guards demanded and they clapped 
the slight desert youths roughly on 
the shoulders. The shortest of the 
guards was a head and a hand 
taller than the tallest of the Arabs. 

“Bread — we want bread,” one of 
the Arabs, less bashful than the 
others, announced. The desert 
Arabs did not have bread of their 
own. They ate camel cheese and 
small animals that they killed in the 
sand and rocks. They ate wild figs 
or cultivated apricots and pome- 
granates and almonds when they 
could steal them. But bread they 
ate only when kind persons gave it 
to them. And now several of the 
kind, though thunderously threat- 
ening guards bought hot bread 
from a bread booth and gave it to 
the Arabs. They ate it rapidly, 
almost furtively, but with real 
pleasure. All of them except one. 

“I will not eat your bread,” said 
Khalid ibn-al-Walid. “It isn’t right 
that I should eat your bread and 
then come back and cut the throats 
of all of you who will not kneel and 
beg for mercy.” 



“Ah, squalid Khalid Walid, will 
you cut our throats?” one of the big 
town guards asked. 

“Aye,” Khalid said nervously 
and looked around to be sure that 
his own jinni or angel did not hear 
him say such a thing. “I must cut 
the throats of all of you who will not 
submit. I will not like it any more 
than you will, but it is one of the 
things that I must do.” 

“With that little sword you will 
cut our throats?” the guard asked. 
“Let me see that wonderful little 
throat-cutter you have there.” 

Khalid handed his sword up to 
the high hand of the tall guard. The 
guard snapped it in two in his 
fingers and gave the pieces back to 
the slight Arab. Khalid's face 
broke and he began to cry. 

The other Arabs ate the wonder- 
ful bread that was given to them. 
They ate apricots and roasted 
meat. They talked with the town 
people and the town guards, for the 
chattering Arabs (after they had 
passed the moments of their shy- 
ness) were always full of news. They 
were called the desert scrolls. They 
drank the bright wine that the 
people gave them. All the Arabs 
did these things except Khalid, who 
refused to eat or drink, though he 
had always loved the wine of this 
place. Then it was time for the 
Arabs to go and they knotted about 
the east gate. Khalid still snuffled 
over the loss of his sword. 

Several of the guards held quiet 
conference. Then one of the guards, 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS 



97 



the one who had broken the sword 
in his fingers, went and brought 
back a real Damascus sword out of 
his generosity (for this was Damas- 
cus, the oldest town in the world 
and the Arabs called it Dimisk 
es-Sham). The man gave the 
wonderful sword to Khalid (it was 
not ornate, but it was of the good 
steel and manufactory) and that 
Arab brightened up like the sun 
coming out from behind the moun- 
tain clouds of the Anti-Lebanon. 
Then all the Arabs went out by the 
east gate. 

“That can not really be 
Khalid ibn-al-Walid the 
Great?” was the unbelieving 
protest of John Dragon who 
was dean of soft sciences at 
Southwestern Polytech. “It 
just isn’t possible.” 

“It does strain credulity,” 
Joseph Waterwitch told him, 
“but that’s the way it comes 
through and that’s the way 
it’s projected. I must suppose 
it’s all valid. It couldn’t be 
otherwise.” 

John Dragon, Joseph 
Waterwitch, Cris Benedetti, 
and Abel Landgood were on 
expedition to observe certain 
events here by para-archeo- 
logical probe. 



T he Arabs shuffled along out- 
side, beneath the basket wall. 
Khalid was grinning into his scanty 



beard. He usually pulled this little 
sword act and trick several times a 
year and he had now quite a collec- 
tion of good Damascus swords. The 
Arab party, a little fewer than a 
hundred young men, shuffled care- 
lessly back toward their desert. 

For about a furlong. 

Then they gave a great whoop. A 
dozen small horses seemed to 
spring out of the sand and were 
quickly mounted by the dozen or so 
of the Arabs so fortunate as to own 
riding animals. These dozen had 
also drawn bows from somewhere. 
And the others had swords sud- 
denly. None of them except Khalid 
had had a sword earlier. Some of 
them picked up two rough ladders 
they had left on the sand before 
their first entrance to the city. They 
ran with these ladders toward the 
basket wall of Damascus. 

“See if you can get better 
detail on the swords,” John 
Dragon asked Joe Water- 
witch. "Hitti, who is never 
wrong, has written that the 
Arabs carried long, straight 
swords in scabbards flung 
over the right shoulder. And 
Belloc, who also is never 
wrong, has written that they 
carried short curved scimitars 
on their thighs.” 

Joe Waterwitch emphasiz- 
ed the swords and the obser- 
vers all watched as the steel 
showed a little more clearly. 

“They are every sort of 



98 



GALAXY 



sword and knife,” Water- 
witch said then and they all 
saw that it was so, “and they 
are carried every which way. 
There is no standardizing 
them and there is no seeing 
them any more clearly than 
this.” 

The Arabs placed their two 
ladders against the basket wall (this 
section of the wall was so called 
because it was there that St. Paul 
had been let down in a basket) . The 
ladders reached only about a third 
of the way to the top of the wall. 
Nevertheless, the Arabs crowded 
the ladders from top to bottom, 
resolutely climbing up and up and 
those on the top waved their arms 
as if to try to fly upward. 

“What are you trying to do, little 
sandmice?” the guards asked from 
the top of the walls. “You’ll hurt 
yourselves. Those little ladders are 
about to break.” 

“We are going to scale the 
walls,” Khalid the leader of the 
Arab sandmice called up boldly. 
“We are going to storm the town 
and slaughter the inhabitants and 
establish ourselves in this strong- 
hold. And from here, we will con- 
quer the whole world.” 

"If you want in come in by the 
gates which are always open,” the 
guards called down. “We think you 
are the same bunch that was in just 
a little while ago. Then you went 
out again. Those little ladders will 
not reach. Shall we put down

longer ladders for you? Shall we let 
down ropes? Are you under some 
vow to scale walls?” 

“Yes, we are under vow to scale 
walls or to' batter them down,” 
Khalid cried. “We will not come in 
by the gate until we have received 
your total surrender. Defend your- 
selves! It is not to our glory if we 
conquer only cowards who fear to 
fight.” 

Khalid and some others began to 
shoot arrows up at the guards. 
They hadn’t true arrows, only 
crooked and badly fletched shafts. 
They hadn’t strong bows — the ar- 
rows did not even reach the top of 
the walls in their flight. The only 
damage done by the arrows was to 
one of the Arabs. This man had 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS 



99 



shot his bolt straight up into the 
air. He stood and gazed at his 
arrow as it spent itself, then tum- 
bled over and fell back toward him. 
The arrow pierced his eye. Some of 
the guards -gasped with shock, but 
several of them laughed. 

“If you laugh at him, if you 
laugh at us, then you laugh at 
God,” Khalid called up angrily. 

“We do not mean to laugh at 
God,” others of the guard spoke 
down. “We are honestly grieved 
that the man injured himself.” 

Both of the ladders broke with 
weak cracking noises and tumbled 
the Arabs onto the sand and rocks 
below. One man was killed and 
several were lamed. The Arabs 
shuffled off toward the desert and 
those few who had horses turned 
toward the barren and sunburned 
hills. 

“We do not retreat,” Khalid 
called from the back of his own 
horse. “It only seems that we re- 
treat. We have breached your walls 
and several, including myself, have 
entered. This night I will sit on the 
highest seat in your council room 
and will hold command of the 
city.” 

“You may come to the council 
room,” one of the guards called, 
“and you may talk to the com- 
mandant of the city. He may be 
able to understand what it is you 
want. He is a man of great under- 
standing. But you may not sit on 
the highest seat.” 

“Yes, I will sit on the highest seat 



tonight,” Khalid insisted. “I am al- 
ready inside the town and the 
room, though you know it not. I 
will command — I will order — I will 
rule and I will slaughter. And after 
I have slaughtered sufficiently I 
also will become a man of great 
understanding.” 

Khalid followed his men back 
into the hilly desert. They left a 
plume of dust behind them and 
when the plume dispersed, they 
were gone. There had been some- 
what less than a hundred of these 
slight Arabs. And there were some- 
thing more than ten thousand of 
the burly empire soldiers and 
guards garrisoned in the city. 

“That cannot be the Mos- 
lem conquest of Damascus of 
the year 635,” John Dragon, 
the dean of soft sciences, was 
protesting in near panic. 

“Yes, that was it,” Joe 
Waterwitch insisted sadly. 
“We have tuned it in pretty 
clearly — -we have watched it 
to its end. That is what 
happened and that is all that 
happened.” 

“There was supposed to be 
a six-month siege,” Abel 
Landgood commented. “And 
when that six months was 
over Damascus was under 
Moslem control.” 

“We will look for the siege, 
but we will not find it,” 
Waterwitch said. “There 
wasn’t any siege of that sort. 



100 



GALAXY 



What we have just seen is all 
that happened. And as for 
Damascus turning from 
Christian to Moslem — well, I 
don't understand it either. A 
plum will be green and then it 
will be red (if it is a Damask 
plum it will be). There are no 
reasons at all for many of the 
changes in history. Let’s leave 
it at that. I do not know why 
history, feeling guilty per- 
haps, is sometimes impelled 
to supply false reasons. Better 
no reasons than false — and 
there are no reasons for the 
results from Damascus.” 

“I believe that there is one 
more event, Joseph,” Cris 
Benedetti said softly. “Our 
focus seemed to be on three 
hours before sunset. Let’s 
allow two more hours for ab- 
lutions and the supper meal. 
So, let’s see what we can pick 
up in the council room five 
hours after our last focus." 

Cris Benedetti was the re- 
vered professor of humanities 
and histories and literatures 
and esoterica at Southwestern 
Polytech. He possibly had 
more prestige even than had 
John Dragon, the dean of soft 
sciences. He certainly had 
more than had Joseph Water- 
witch — Joe had a peculiar 
lack of prestige. But Joe be- 
lieved in himself and his 
methods and he didn’t like to 
be told that he might have 



missed something. He looked 
at Benedetti for a long min- 
ute. 

“All right, we’ll do it,” Joe 
Waterwitch said then. 

T he fmd-and-focus itself took 
nearly five hours, but the times 
were not connected and the delay in 
search did not matter. Then those 
of the expedition were able to see 
what was going on at the evening’s 
session in the council room. And 
what was going on was a developing 
ruckus. 

There were seven great m^n 
sitting in the high seats in the coun- 
cil room: pompous men, somewhat 
amused now and a little bit fearful. 
They were amused by an audacious 
and slight man who was leaping 
about in the rafters over their 
heads — he mocked them, harangu- 
ed them, and they smiled. But they 
were really slightly alarmed by the 
monkeylike climbing of this man, 
actually fearful of his stark animal- 
ity and his go-devil grinning and of 
the jinni-like secrets that were 
tumbling out of him in unbottled 
speech that sounded as if it would 
never be exhausted. They were 
disturbed by the gaminlike thievery 
of that rafter rooster who’d as soon 
steal a world as a sack of walnuts. 

“I will command — I will rule — I 
will slaughter,” the monkeylike 
man in the rafters was heckling, 
‘‘and when I have slaughtered 
enough I will become a man of even 
greater understanding than your- 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS 



101 



selves.” This heckling climber over 
their heads was Khalid. 

“I wonder when the Byzan- 
tine look made its first ap- 
pearance?” John Dragon ask- 
ed his fellow observers. 

‘‘Surely not in Byzantium,” 
Cris Benedetti said, “but here 
in Damascus, in this place, 
on this night. Look at those 
seven on their high seats! It 
has just dawned in their 
minds that they have lost it all 
(that is the underlay of the 
Byzantine look) and that if 
they continue as they have 
been nobody but themselves 
will guess that they have 
really lost (that is the brocade 
surface of the" Byzantine 
look). I don’t know how they 
have lost and they don’t — but 
the towering irony comes only 
after they have lost complete- 
ly and disregarded that loss.” 

There were seven men there with 
that look on them. In the highest 
seat was the commandant of the 
city. At his right was the bishop. At 
his left was the treasurer. The com- 
mandant himself was pomposity 
justified. He was wealth and line 
and power and intelligence. He was 
the deep texture of past pleasures, 
the hot light of present pleasure 
and the aromatic glow of pleasure 
still to come. He laughed at his own 
defeat and forbade it to speak. 

The bishop on the right had ex- 



ceptional ability, a highly refined 
and rarefied sensuality, a canniness 
that had obtained an unusually 
good bargain from God himself, a 
stormy sort of sublimation (chan- 
neled and diverted thunder), com- 
passion, wit, well-being — and there 
was a foxy slyness that went with it 
all. This bishop had fished in 
stranger waters than his father 
Peter ever knew — in Third Ocean 
of whose very existence both God 
and the devil are ignorant. 

And the treasurer on the left had 
the endless geniality that comes 
from never exhausted stores. He 
had the money bags that pour out 
specie forever to smooth the paths 
and to make friends — the bags re- 
main full no matter how much is 
taken from them. He had the sack 
of inexhaustible pleasure, and the 
barrelful of those sweet serpents 
named intrigue whose joy outlasts 
that of every other game. And into 
the eyes of this extraordinary trea- 
surer had come a new glow now: 
happy treason, the last pleasure of 
the almost jaded. 

Two other men sat on the right, 
two other men sat on the left — they 
were high and intricate men — of 
the sort who maintained the hea- 
venly Byzantine Empire on Earth. 

“I sit in the highest seat in the 
council room,” jibed Khalid, who 
had made himself a seat up in the 
rafters (that Khalid was an ungiant 
jinni who had escaped from some 
bottle), “and I will hold command 
of the city.” 



102 



GALAXY 



One of the great men on the left 
of the commandant laughed — Kha- 
lid had nearly fallen from his high 
place when he had gestured too vio- 
lently. “It seems a very precarious 
command.” 

“I want it to be precarious,” 
Khalid howled. “I am already in- 
side you, though you cannot sus- 
pect it yet. 1 will command — I will 
order — I will slaughter. I will 
breach your walls. I lay siege to you 
now.” 

“How long is the siege that you 
lay for us?” asked one of the great 
men on the right and he grinned in 
his beard. 

“A half-year siege,” Khalid call- 
ed down and he danced on the 
smoke-blackened rafter. Guards 
were climbing after Khalid, but 
they could not scamper about with 
his quickness or his wittiness — they 
couldn’t catch him. Khalid bound- 
ed to other rafters and cross- 
members. 

“Your eyes are put in your heads 
wrong and they look out wrong,” 
Khalid taunted. “Your eyes look 
for me where I am no longer to be 
found. You’d double your defenses 
to keep me out, would you, city 
fathers? But I am not out. I am the 
mind-worm working inside and I 
besiege you from inside. I came in 
under the walls and under your 
minds by the other river, the one 
that is not to be found in your coun- 
try or in the maps of it. You great 
men cannot understand this.” 

“I understand it,” said the great 



treasurer and his eyes were a-dance 
with happy treason. 

“I almost understand it,” said 
the great bishop and his fingers 
were avid to be dealing with strange 
fish. 



“And I almost understand 
it,” said Cris Benedetti, one 
of the men working on the 
para-archeological probe. 

II 

There is an absolute my- 
stery covering all early Is- 
lamic expansion and military 
conquest. There is no possible 
way these things could have 
happened. Circumstances 
sometimes put forward to ex- 
plain these happenings are in 
fact later circumstances 
created by these same hap- 
penings. The clear truth is 
that the desert Arabs were ab- 
solutely inferior to all their 
neighbors in wealth, num- 
bers, technology, health, abil- 
ity, intellect, location, ambi- 
tion, sophistication, weapon- 
ry, organization, transporta- 
tion and experience in war- 
fare. Their victories could not 
have been won in reality. It 
had to be a subjective reli- 
gious rapture to make it seem 
to the Arabs that they were 
conquering. But how was the 
exterior world and its peoples 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS 



103 



conned into authenticating 
these subjective experiences 
of the miserable Arabs? 
Moreover, Islam was not then 
a rapture religion — it did not 
become so until two centuries 
later. Nor was Islam then a 
militant religion — it became 
so only after the completion 
of those astonishing, early, 
world-shaking conquests. 

At Damascus, the attack- 
ing Arabs had only one-hun- 
dredth the numbers of the de- 
fenders. They had nothing 
but short, curved knives and 
inferior bows with which to 
assault the walls. They had no 
battering rams or siege en- 
gines at all — they did not even 
have entrenching tools. How 
did they breach the walls after 
a six-month siege? How did 
they take the strong town that 
had one hundred defenders 
against every one attacker? 

Here was an incredibly 
small and disorganized band 
of half-starved, half-dement- 
ed desert men looking out of 
pus -caked eyes (Paul was not 
the first nor the millionth 
man to go blind on the 
dazzling road to Damascus), 
small men, sick men, nearly 
blind men, men with no am- 
bition and no hope, beggars 
wrapped in euphoric dreams 
more ragged than their cloth- 
ing, men sleeping away most 
of the hours to forget that 



they had nothing to eat. How 
did these men, at the very 
first step, conquer Damas- 
cus? How did they, at the in- 
credibly swift second step, 
conquer the world? 

Could one travel in a time 
wagon pulled by time oxen 
back to Damascus in the year 
635 and look at the events 
with informed, modern eyes, 
it is possible that a missing 
piece to this puzzle might be 
found. But I doubt even this. 

There is no way that those 
events could have happened!

That is what the respected

matter. But there cannot be 
anything wrong with our 
methods. There cannot be 
that much wrong with our-

thing wrong with history. 
History was not there when 
we went back to examine

ment and the receiver and I 
believe that I have received 
correctly what was there. The 
fact that what was there is im-

overwhelmingly beside the

“This brings into question 
the whole subject of reality. 
Reality has been an assump- 
tion, a postulate, an evident 
basis and beginning. It now 
seems to have been a false as- 
sumption. Reality has disap- 
peared on us when we had the 
temerity to examine it too 
closely. What we now need to 
find and to use is a workable 
alternate to reality.”

“Gentlemen, I believe that 
our difficulty is that we have

Cris Benedetti 

From the Landwitch Papers 
(the minutes of the first 
para-archeological probe) 

The Rivers of Damascus as 
mentioned in Scripture are 



two: the Abana River and the 
Pharpar River. But where are 
they now? The Abana River is 
now named the Barada. This 
is the only River of Damascus 
to be found in the physical 
world. There is no other river 
in that part of the country. 
There is no dry bed where any 
other river could ever have 
run. There is no choked and 
silted valley that could have 
been a riverbed in some other 
age. The Pharpar River is not 
to be found anywhere in that 
scorched land at all. There is 
no trace or remnant or body 
print of it to be discovered 
anywhere on Earth. 

Well then, have you looked 
under the Earth? Have you 
looked inside the Earth? Have 
you looked inside the crea- 
tures of the Earth? When a 
river is lost we must leave no 
land or mind unturned until 
we have found it, for a lost 
river may be anywhere. I be- 
lieve that the Pharpar River 
has always been of the inter- 
nal sort. It is the secret river 
that not only greens the soul 
but also runs under walls and 
gains entrance to all fortified 
and walled places of the world

The River Inside, 
Ignace Wolff 

T he heterodyning of a brain 
wave produces a difference 
frequency or beat in conjunction 
with the normal brain wave — and 
this difference frequency can be 
both a sending and an echoing 
beat. It may also become a receptor 
beat, and in some cases a rever- 
beratory beat of very long duration. 
Of how long duration? Oh, two 
thousand years or so before it be- 
comes too greatly diminished to 
pick up. 

But scientifically a beat may re- 
verberate for only microseconds 
after the inaction of its source — this 
scientific objection may not be as- 
sailed in its own field and context. 
But may the scientific objection be 
heterodyned out of its own field? 
May it be superheterodyned to a 
place where it accepts what it had 
seemed to deny? 

The ever-changing modified or 
heterodyned wave pattern is a 
searching or tuning pattern. It 
seeks whatever is in resonance with 
its voice. It changes its voice till it 
finds that resonance. But hardly 
one person in a thousand can con- 
sciously heterodyne his own brain 
wave patterns to obtain the varia- 
tions and the beats. The rare ones 
who can are sometimes called 



dowsers. True dowsers can get 
echoes from almost all physical 
substances — and also from many 
electrical coronas that are not really 
physical substances. Very good 
dow'sers can get resonance and 
echoes from an even more rare sort 
of corona, which is called patina. 
The patina, that aged and weather- 
ed surface, is generally thought to 
be a physical effect and substance — 
but it hasn’t a physical origin. 

Adept dowsers may also get reso- 
nances from ancient reverberations 
(some of them associated with 
patinas or other coronas, some ap- 
parently associated with nothing 
but themselves) that may have be- 
come endemic to a location, to have 
lodged there securely and endur- 
ingly. And dowsers are peculiarly 
able to get echoes from under- 
ground streams, which may be 
heterodynings of surface streams 
which are not necessarily in the im- 
mediate location. 

A good dowser can hear the sig- 
naling of rocks and sands and 
loams. He can hear water talk. He 
can hear air talk. He can hear a 
valley or a fortress talk. Joseph 
Waterwitch was a good dowser. He 
came by his talent honestly. He was 
a Shawnee Indian and the Shaw- 
nees can outdowse any other In- 
dians in the world. Waterwitch had 
been given to Joe’s folks as a family 
name because of their expertness in 
witching anything from water to 
fresh meat trails. 

But dowsers are scientifically un- 



106 



GALAXY 



acceptable. Joseph Waterwiteh had 
been kicked out of the usually free 
and easy Geologists’ Club when he 
refused to deny that he had dows- 
ing talents. He had been kicked out 
quite literally — out of the private 
bar, out through the dining room 
and the meeting room, out through 
the library and exhibit rooms. Then 
he was kicked violently down that 
short flight of five steps to the 
street — to the injury of both his 
pride and his coccyx. 

But are all scientists absolutely 
closed to such things? May not 
some entry be made into some 
minds? At times it has been 
thought that an entrance can be 
made by certain underchannels, by 
streams that flow unsuspected be- 
low the medulla walls or that per- 
meate the pons variolii to break 
through. (Even at the Geologists’ 
Club there had been one man 
drenched by the under-river, a man 
who might open the gates at the 
proper time — when he heard the 
off-key whistle of sweet treason. 
This man knew a lot about odd fre- 
quencies and could split stubborn 
rocks with his own double-tuned 
whistling.) 

A patina is a reverberating sur- 
. face that is composed entirely 
of its own history and possibly does 
not exist in the present time. But 
this definition beggars John Dra- 
gon’s statement that there is no 
room for the present in present 
time — that the present must always 



be phenomenologically slightly in 
the future and cannot be perceived 
except by this very slight shift into 
future time. Present time is an 
anomaly — it is less than a quantum 
wide and its very narrowness posits 
its nonexistence. It is too narrow a 
crack to exist — and yet there may 
be a two-way traffic through that 
narrow crack. Unacceptable things 
do come through the narrow crack 
that is mistakenly called the pres- 
ent, such as cranks, ghosts and 
treasures. 

A patina may be very deep and 
still retain all the characteristics of 
a surface phenomenon. It is made 
up of old vibrations and waves and 
of nothing else — yet it has mass and 
physical substance and waves sup- 
posedly do not. And a patina, 
though seldom containing metal, 
shows magnetic properties. 

It is not only stones and rocks 
that acquire a patina. The patina is 
often spoken of as an aging and a 
weathering, but young and growing 
things sometimes show striking pa- 
tinas. An adolescent plum just 
coming to full color may have a 
patina — a smoky surface ghost of 
that full color: it is patina, whatever 
other name it bears. A human 
being may have a patina which con- 
tains all of that being’s experience. 
And a newborn child may have a 
surface patina that reflects the 
complete history of its ancestors as 
well as its own makeup and shorter 
history. In countries where the 
niceties prevail this valuable patina 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS 



107 



is often washed off the newborn 
child. Such removal makes for 
trauma and dislocation. The child 
is permanently deprived. He will 
grow' other patina but it will never 
be the same. He will forever lack 
roots and history and surety. He 
will seldom become a truly rever- 
berating person. 

Patina is the depositing and 
burial of objects and events and 
persons. And patina can be, under 
the proper tutelage, the resurrec- 
tion of those objects and events and 
persons. Patina is the recording 
and remembering and transmitting 
surface of everything. 

But is there any proof at all that 
patina may record and remember 
and later transmit or recreate per- 
sons and objects and events? Surely 
there is proof. Ghosts are the 
proof — the tens of thousands of re- 
ports of ghost persons and ghost 
events. Ghosts are the transmitting 
and recreating of old things and old 
doings. 

You do not accept ghosts? You 
have not been touched even once by 
the ghost river named Pharpar? It 
is not good to remain untouched by 
it. It is the river of resurrection. If 
you will not accept ghosts, neither 
will you accept one risen from the 
dead. 

T ihe dowser turned inside out is 
the eidolon man. Joseph Water- 
witch was a supreme dowser. His 
associate Abel Landgood was a 
dowser-inside-out, an image man 



or an eidolon man. As a projector 
of valid eidolons, images and re- 
creations he was as expert as a 
formally untrained person can be. 

The great breakthrough arrived 
with the acquaintance and associa- 
tion of Waterwitch and Landgood. 
Together they drew up the Land- 
good Covenant. They had the whole 
procedure completed between them 
before they went to have it instru- 
mented. 

Abel Landgood had had a most 
normal childhood, even excessively 
normal. He had walked and talked 
w'ith ghosts from the day he was 
able to walk and talk. All children 
do this, but not all are as good at 
fixing ghosts as was Abel. Abel was 
an imaginative, creative boy. He 
was weirdly happy in his relations 
with the world and that is always 
important. And he did not like 
empty spaces at all. Whenever he 
found a stubbornly empty space he 
filled it with his imagination. There 
had been an empty space between 
the alley fence and the alley behind 
his house. He filled it with three 
apple trees and some blackberry 
bushes and would eat apples and 
blackberries there till he got sick. 

There was also a little vacant 
half-lot across the alley. A house 
had once stood there. It had 
burned down. Abel put another 
house there — a funny-looking 
house. He put a very fat woman 
and a very thin man to live in the 
house and fixed their names to be 
Mrs. and Mr. Ostergoster. He put 



108 



GALAXY 



a boy to live in the house and fixed 
his name to be Mikey Ostergoster. 
Mikey fixed a cat. Abel fixed a dog 
that chased the cat away. Mikey 
fixed a crazy man to chase the dog 
with a stick. Abel fixed a soldier to 
chase off the crazy man. Mrs. and 
Mr. Ostergoster came out and 
quarreled with the soldier. Every- 
body began to fight then. Abel’s 
father came out and unhinged all 
those folks and the funny-looking 
house also. And those things were 
gone in a blinking. 

“You shouldn't have brought 
back the Ostergosters,” Abel’s 
father told him when they were 
alone and the echoes of the distur- 
bance were retreating into a secon- 
dary patina. “There are people in 
the neighborhood who still remem- 
ber them and remember how they 
burned in the little house there — 
ah — in the little house that is not 
there. And you shouldn’t have 
brought back the Confederate sol- 
dier to chase off that crazy man. 
With our reputation we can’t afford 
to seem too old-line Southern. And 
you shouldn’t have brought back 
that particular dog. I remember 
that dog before they had to kill it. It 
was one mean dog — it’s a wonder 
you weren't bitten. Cool it a little 
bit, Abel, or people will think that 
you’re an odd kid.” 

But Abel wasn’t an odd kid at 
all. He was absolutely normal. It’s 
the kids who lack or lose the basic 
talents who are odd. 

The Landgoods had to move 



twice during the childhood and 
adolescence of Abel. The family 
seemed to attract ghosts and the 
neighbors objected. (Ghosts are 
normal, but people often react ab- 
normally to ghosts.) It was not all 
Abel’s doings about the ghosts. 
Like Joseph Waterwitch, Abel 
Landgood did not acquire all his 
talent in his own generation. Both 
his father and his mother had 
talent. 

And, like his parents, Abel 
retained his talents after he had 
become an adult. An average child 
will lose such abilities, but a 
normal child will retain them. 

J oseph waterwitch (the man 
with the locating or homing 
beats, who could bring any interest- 
ing location or time or patina into 
focus and privately enjoy it) met 
Abel Landgood (the man with the 
strong imagination, the image-pro- 
jecting or eidolon- making talent by 
which interesting old things could 
be enjoyed by everybody) . They rea- 
lized that between them they could 
recreate anything that had ever 
been — or anything that had ever 
existed strongly enough to leave its 
impress on time in patina-form, for 
patina is the living precipitate of 
time. On the basis of this they drew 
up the Landwitch Covenant to serve 
as an Enabling Act. (Abe! Land- 
good spelled it en-Abel-ing Act on 
his copy — he was a good-humored 
man, but specifically his humor 
was quite bad.) 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS

Needing guidance, the two men 
joined forces with John Dragon, the 
dean of soft sciences at Southwest- 
ern Polytech and with Cris Bene- 
detti who was professor of miscel- 
laneous subjects. Dragon got an ap- 
propriation (mostly travel money) 
to test the Covenant in a puzzling 
historical situation. Cris Benedetti 
took the two talented gentlemen 
down to Barnaby Sheen’s elec- 
tronics shop where two young elec- 
tronic geniuses — a smooth-faced 
young man named Roy Mega and a 
hairy-faced young man named Aus- 
tro — built imposing and sophisti- 
cated instruments that would rein- 
force the talents of the two men and 
would also give a scientific appear- 
ance to the enterprise. 

“I believe that the patina-deposit 
complex is so complete,” Joe 
Waterwitch had said on the eve of 
their first monumental testing, 
“that it would not greatly matter if 
all life should suddenly disappear 
from Earth. Secondary life would 
spring from these deposits. The 
many millions of micro-books 
written on skins (on the skins of 
rock, on the skins of everything) 
would bring forth recreated life — 
whatever life was most ready and 
most avid to be resurrected. I be- 
lieve that I have already experi- 
enced glimpses and manifestations 
of the reactivating mechanism. It 
would be a curious life and a 
curious world then. Everything in it 
would be the ghost of something 
that had gone before, but the com- 



binations would be new, the motifs 
and forms would be completely 
fresh. It would not be a sequential 
world or a rational one. Anomaly 
would be the characteristic. It 
would be like — ” 

“It would be like the world we 
live in now,” Cris Benedetti said. 
“You have described our own world 
perfectly and I suspect that your 
thesis is correct. We live in a re- 
created secondary. All life did sud- 
denly disappear from Earth — I’m 
not sure when this happened. Sec- 
ondary life, made up entirely of 
anomalous ghosts, did spring up 
from old residues written small on 
various skins. We are the anoma- 
lous ghosts and this world is our 
world.” 

“I believe that there are a few 
slight objections to your theory,” 
John Dragon said with that deadly 
seriousness that is found only in 
citizens of secondary worlds. 
“There are so many things about us 
that have to be happening for the 
first time. There are things too 
flimsy ever to be reproduced. How- 
ever, we may be living in an abor- 
tive secondary.”

T he constituted body known as 
the Landwitch Covenant — that 
para-archeological investigating 
team — failed its first major test. Its 
little movie. The Fall of Damas- 
cus — filmed on a working site — 
may well have been the worst movie 



110 



GALAXY 



ever made. However its failures 
came about, it was sick parody, 
ridiculously false history and it 
simply could not have been a resur- 
rection of the past. It received 
bitter assessment from the scien- 
tific community, for the para-arch- 
eological probe had been represent- 
ed as somehow scientific. 

The whole group had been com- 
pletely discredited — and one Kha- 
lid had been voted the ironic award 
of “Worst Actor of the Year, of 
Any Year.” 

“They give us no credit at all,” 
Abel Landgood complained. “This 
is the first movie ever made to con- 
sist entirely of complete ghosts and 
complete ghost sites. Who else was 
ever able to evoke an integrated 
past so entirely? And of course it is 
scientific! What else could it be? 
Admittedly there was something 
the matter with the past that we 
evoked, but we’ll solve that too." 

‘“The worst actor of the year, 
any year!’” Khalid fumed. ‘‘I’ll 
show them — ” 

“Can you get another appropria- 
tion, Dragon?” Joseph Waterwitch 
asked. 

“No, I’m out completely,” John 
Dragon said sorrowfully. “Ragged, 
bagged, tagged and fired from 
Southwestern Polytech. ‘You’re 
making a mistake,’ I told them. 
‘You’re destroying the balance of 
things. You need a dean of soft 
sciences.’ ‘Not that soft,’ they said. 
Did you ever watch a ceremonial 
academic putdown? They cut the 



brass buttons off my dean’s coat, 
broke my plate and turned my pic- 
ture to the wall.” 

“Worst actor of the year!” Kha- 
lid smoldered. “I’ll make them eat 
that! I don’t know why I came 
through so badly, though. That 
wasn’t the real me.” 

“It isn’t fair," Waterwitch grous- 
ed. “We're put clear down, but 
everyone who touched us comes up 
smelling like lilacs. That kid Aus- 
tro who works for Sheen, he has a 
writeup and an article in the latest 
Geology This Month. The article is 
Instrumental Reception of Igneous 
Rock Mantle Data by Means of 
Pulsating Heterodyning Grids, and 
it’s subtitled Search and Focus, or 
Do Rocks Remember? And talk 
about a gadget! The kid must be a 
freak. It says the ‘manuscript’ for 
his article was chiseled on thin 
stone tablets.” 

‘‘Who does he think he is — 
Moses?” Abel Landgood exploded. 
“He’s a friend of yours, isn’t he, 
Benedetti? What kind of friends do 
you have anyhow?” 

“Right now, all of us need all the 
friends we can get,” Cris Benedetti 
said. 

“Worst actor of the year!” 
Khalid still moaned. “I’ll rub their 
noses in that before I’m through. 
But why wasn’t it the real me?” 
“Maybe Austro can devise a fil- 
ter for excessively polarized data,” 
Cris Benedetti said hopefully. 

“What hurts is that Austro was 
working for us and got his ideas 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS 



111 



from us,” Waterwitch insisted. 
“And Geology This Month de- 
scribes him as ‘highly professional 
and impeccably scientific — if he 
were not so, his theories would be 
grotesque.’ If that fuzz-faced clown 
is scientific, what are we?” 

“Some have it, some don’t,” Cris 
said. 

“He used us.” 

“Then we’ll use him,” Khalid 
said reasonably. “There’s no doubt- 
ing it — that kid has drunk from the 
older river. That means that he can 
enter and infiltrate and topple — 
and that's what he is doing. There 
have to be such manipulators 
working behind scenes whenever 
you go into the business of tum- 
bling walls down, and there have to 
be these awkward stalking-horses 
out in front. Though I never before 
thought of myself as a stalking- 
horse.” 

“Well, just what are you, Kha- 
lid,” Landgood asked, “and what 
are you doing here?” 

“Yes, we’ve all been wondering 
that,” Cris Benedetti said. 

“You’re a residue among resi- 
dues.” Joe Waterwitch said. “I 
focused on you and Abel Landgood 
catalyzed you into apparent being. 
You’re a ghost, a recreation from 
the past. You aren’t real.” 

“What man is sure of his own re- 
ality?” Khalid asked. “Are any of 
you? We desert people have gone 
into this much more deeply than 
you Franks have. Thinking isn’t 
your line. But you clods precipi- 



tated a Khalid as seen through 
Damascene-Byzantine eyes. No 
wonder I was selected worst actor of 
the year! Why didn’t you catalyze 
the real me, the shrewd, brilliant, 
spacious, nonpareil political and 
military genius, the leader of the 
canniest and trickiest and most so- 
phisticated bunch of men ever as- 
sembled?” 

“Ah. because our data was pol- 
arized,” Cris Benedetti said. “We 
tuned in on residues and patinas as 
seen by Damascene eyes because 
those were the eyes that predomi- 
nated in Damascus. That’s the way 
you looked to those city people, so 
that's the way you looked to our in- 
struments and film. I believe that it 
could have been corrected if we had 
had a little more experience in 
these things. But it’s all water over 
the dam now.” 

“No, no, water under the dam,” 
shrewd, brilliant, spacious, non- 
pareil Khalid said evenly. “Oh, 
that water is our salvation! Let’s go 
see those kids. Somehow they’re at 
home in the other river.” 

“How come you speak English, 
Khalid?” asked John Dragon, the 
ex-dean. 

“More polarized data,” Khalid 
explained. “I don’t really. But you 
know me by your own polarized 
English-speaking minds. So to you 
it seems as if I speak as you do.” 

{(are you still in good graces at 

/\. Polytech, Benedetti?” Land- 
good asked as the men (and a con- 



112 



GALAXY 



tingent man, Khalid, a barefoot 
ghost in odd robes) walked the half- 
mile down Six-Shooter Road to 
Sheen’s electronic works. 

“Oh, they’ve given me a sabbati- 
cal,” Cris Benedetti said. “They 
said that I needed a rest. It’s fine, I 
suppose, but it’s without pay.” 

“Won’t it be a little hard on you 
to go a year without pay, Bene- 
detti?” 

“It's seven years. They convinced 
me that a sabbatical is for seven 
years. They also said that the sab- 
batical was renewable. They’ve 
always been nice people to work 
for, and they’re scientifically ortho- 
dox. Some of them will appear on 
tonight's great TV news Spectacu- 
lar, SCIENCE SUPREME, THE END 
OF THE CRACKPOTS.” 

‘‘Which are the crackpots?” 
Khalid asked. 

“Such as ourselves,” John Dra- 
gon said. “Para-archeologists and 
such.” 

“No, no, they’re wrong,” Khalid 
protested. “Because a thing is done 
badly, as your thing sure was, is no 
reason to throw it away. Keep with 
it.” 

‘‘That other genius kid, Roy 
Mega, is just as ambivalent as Aus- 
tro is." Abel Landgood sighed. “In 
the latest Para-Electronics Today 
he is quoted a bit. I’ll read it: ‘The 
scientific community may be a little 
too prone to suspect vivid depict- 
ment of time-residue data. Why- 
should such representation not be 
vivid — as long as it is valid? The 



translation of residue data falls as 
easily into anthropomorphic forms 
as into modified sine wave or any 
other graphic form. It is no real in- 
dictment that a translation of 
residue men and sites should look 
like men and sites. However, we 
cannot condone the excesses of cer- 
tain adventurers in their recent ex- 
travaganza. As the boys say. Do not 
task us with Damascus. That was a 
sad and discrediting thing. We 
wash our hands of such excesses.’” 

“With which water does he wash 
his hands?” Khalid asked. “From 
which side of the she-wolf does this 
cub suck? Ambivalence may often 
be its own best tactic, but not al- 
ways. We will see.” 

“There’s more,” Landgood said. 
“He writes ‘We must begin to ac- 
cept even the fleshing of time-resi- 
due ghosts, just as we have arrived 
at the fleshing of T.V. images. Yet 
we do well to be suspicious if they 
are of too funny a flesh. Malodo- 
rous and deformed ghosts disprove 
themselves.’” 

“I’m one of those he means,” 
Khalid grumbled. “Worst actor of 
any year! I’ll come back on them. 
I’ll rub their noses in it,” 

“He goes on,” said Landgood, 
‘‘We, along with all responsible 
scientists, must reject these current 
debasements of — ”* 

Landgood, reading, collided with 
Roy Mega, who was strolling in 
front of Sheen’s electronics build- 
ing. 

“It’s good to hear oneself quoted 



RIVERS OF DAMASCUS 



113 



with such total preoccupation,” 
Roy Mega said. “Gentlemen — ah — 
I see that you have one of the funny 
fleshies with you.” 

“A care, young colt!” Khalid 
said with barefoot dignity. “I have 
dined on infidel tongues before and 
I’ll have yours out by the roots. 
There's a special flavor to the 
waggle- well, young- fool tongue.” 
“A care, old nag,” Roy Mega 
said with gathering hubris. “You 
aren’t real and you aren’t here. You 
are no more than the experimental 
after-image of a bad motion picture 
ghost. As an after-image you are 
my experiment and I can terminate 
you easily. Your apparent continu- 
ation after the show and its record- 
ing were finished owes itself to a 
trick I intruded into the equip- 
ment. Your appearance depends on 
one holding coil, one small electro- 
magnet, that I set in the circuits. 
And it is a time-release holding 
coil, so your continuation is quite 
precarious. In fact, it should — ” 
“The coil should have released it- 
self some hours or days ago, should 
it not, young colt?” Khalid smiled. 
“It should have released itself when 
my days of grace were finished. 
These were the day during which I 
tracked down these men who had 
had something to do with my 
wakening. I wanted to find out why 
I had come through so badly, why it 
wasn’t the real me. But now r there is 
more than one holding coil in the 
equipment you built — and more 
than one in equipment that you 



know not of. Oh, I’ve insured and 
reinsured the circuitry on which I 
depend. I am even on the verge of 
making myself independent of all 
circuitry, of making myself of less 
funny flesh, of becoming again 
more than an electric man. Why 
should my continuance depend on 
fleshless circuitry? There is One on 
whom all depends." 

“Carrock, " said Austro, the 
young, hair-faced electronics 
genius, as he came out of the elec- 
tronics building. 

‘‘A stranger colt, you,” said 
Khalid, turning pleasantly to Aus- 
tro. “You at least, if not the other, 
have drunk from the hidden and in- 
tuitive river. You at least can cir- 
cumvent and enter the walled city. 
Possibly of funny flesh yourself, but 
yours is a greening genius from that 
hidden water.” 

“Mud on my mouth, I have 
drunk from it!” Austro declared. 
“And so also has Roy here. He is as 
conniving and cantankerous a per- 
son as yourself, good Khalid. Car- 
rock, why don’t we all come in- 
side?” 

They all went inside. 



£ ^rruus Roy boy, this dolt colt 
.l here, he is not as conniving as 
myself,” Khalid preached when 
they had settled indoors. “He does 
not make sure. He does not check 
back. Had I placed a time coil in an 
equipment, I would know it when 
the time had run out and the coil

had forgotten to release. Could so 
careless a young man have taken 
Damascus? Could he have taken 
Ctesiphon or Baghdad?" 

“Like Grant took Richmond,” 
Roy Mega crowed. “Like Sungai 
took Dashbashpul.” 

“Carrock, kids. To peace and to 
work,” Austro poured aromatic oil 
on the hidden, intuitive waters. “By 
the sour'd ears of science, we have 
more to do than set a-blowing the 
sand of old battles. Carrock!" 

“Are you a fancy-talking hair- 
face?” Khalid asked him. “But I 
believe that I have heard that you 
are only a device manufactured by 
the jinni named Sheen.” 

“Oh, Austro’s real enough, Kha- 
lid,” Cris Benedetti assured the 
out-of-time Arab when they were 
all at ease in the lounge of the elec- 
tronics building. “And Austro is 
right. We have to set a-blowing the 
sand of new battles. Now. But how- 
will we do it? The great walls of 
science are guarded by so many 
that not even a mouse can get in. 
They even have a battalion of a 
thousand and one furious mouse- 
hunters. And the bright pennant 
SCIENCE SUPREME, THE END OF 
the crackpots will fly over those 
high battlements tonight. Khalid, 
we do need an old desert warrior 
here.” 

“I am the greatest ever,” Khalid 
answered them. “But several times 
all of you have spoken of science 
without total respect and this I do 
not understand. We are talking 



about the same thing, high science, 
llm itself? I thought that science 
was all to the good. The Byzantines 
believed that they had come to the 
end of it — we knew that we had just 
come to the beginning of it, but we 
came to that beginning with joy. 
We ciphered more intricate mathe- 
matics in the sand than they in 
their scrolls. We studied more com- 
plex starways from our sandy hills 
than they from their towers. We 
brewed more chemistries from the 
bark of one incense tree than they 
from all their archive dust. At 
desert smitheries and forges we 
built instruments and machines be- 
yond anything they imagined. And 
we made a rhetoric and eloquence 
to carry on and announce these 
things. After Him whom all adore, 
w r e most adored science, the holy 
llm. And you now hold science in 
bad repute? Has the Byzantine con- 
tempt and satisfaction come back? 
Has the wheel turned a full circle? 
It’s almost as if we hadn’t whipped 
them completely.” 

“Yes, the contempt and satisfac- 
tion with past knowledge have 
come back,” John Dragon said 
sadly. “And they have encrusted 
the thing itself. The noble old ship 
is sluggish and bottom-heavy with -- 
barnacles. The Free Brother of 
man, your holy llm, has impris- 
oned himself behind walls and is no 
longer free.” 

“We know how to enter and 
throw down walls,” Khalid said. 
“You, the two young geniuses, get

you busy instrumenting it. There 
will be an event, will there? Then 
we will capture and ride that event. 
We begin the assault tonight. We 
will assail the encrustation from 
inside.” 

“This isn’t Damascus, this isn’t 
Baghdad,” Abel Landgood said. 

“Yes it is,” Khalid insisted. 
“The encrustations, the wallings, 
the enclosures — they are Damas- 
cus, they are Ctesiphon, they are 
Baghdad. Young geniuses, are you 
at work on it?” 

“Ah, I’m not quite sure what — ” 
Roy Mega hesitated. “We’ve been 
using doubletalk and we've been 
washing our hands a lot. I don’t 
know what else — ” 

"Carrock, I’m sure, I know,” 
Austro said. “Here, Roy, come 
work. We make them use double- 
talk in their own mouths.” 

“If I only knew what we’re sup- 
posed to be doing — ” Roy Mega 
complained. 

"If you have to ask you’ve missed 
it,” Khalid told him. “Surely a 
smart young man like you wouldn’t 
miss it. We need your fine hubris. 
We need your sharp distinctions. 
The noble thing itself will be bruis- 
ed a bit when we tear through its 
encrustations, but noble things are 
always tough. Come, come, Frank- 
ish men, we need the fine edge of 
your minds for our polarity. What 
we really need is irony, a little un- 
conscious irony.” 

“That’s the hardest kind,” Cris 
Benedetti said. 



“It’s almost time for that damn- 
able TV Spectacular science su- 
preme, THE END OF THE CRACK- 
POTS,” Joe Waterwitch said 
through clenched teeth. “I will hate 
the smugness of it, the exclusions, 
the cursed closed-mindedness. And 
yet I’ll be fascinated by that whole 
barrel of snakes and I don’t know 
why.’,' 

“ Carrock , so will I, and I do 
know why,” said that young genius 
Austro. “Is it two receivers we will 
set up, Khalid, sir? That way we 
can have one that shows what every- 
body sees and the other one to show 
it the way they’re really doing it. 
That one will be tricky, but very in- 
structive. We will need to follow it 
along as we go so we can modify our 
patterns. We have to know what it 
is that we’re heterodyning.” 

“I can do it,” Roy Mega said. “I 
was slow to pick it up and that isn’t 
my way at all, but I know I can 
handle it now. Exquisite shielding 
for the check-set, and unscram- 
bling the scramble! It will be the 
only set in the world to show our 
process in unmodified form, a real 
curiosity. And the modified one will 
show the full flowering, the tilt, the 
scramble. There’s no limit to it — or 
to just how good we really are.” 

“Is there power enough for such 
amplification?” Cris Benedetti ask- 
ed. He wasn’t an electronics man. 

“Electrically, yes,” Roy Mega 
said. “Mentally — that's up to all of 
us. And be not quite your usual 
kind self, Mr. Benedetti. We need

a little urbane arrogance and we 
need it from you. We need a little 
elegance from someone. Is there 
anyone elegant here besides me? 
Contribute, men, it is almost 
time.” 

"Carrock, we hope, we hope,” 
Austro howled — and he was modi- 
fying equipment faster than you 
could blink. 

“It shouldn’t take much elec- 
tricity,” Khalid guessed. “We took 
Damascus with only crude sparking 
coils and primitive Greek fire to re- 
inforce our own mind-worm bit. Of 
course it took us six months. And 
our new assault will take us six 
months or six years or sixty, but we 
will finish the beginning of it to- 
night. As to the power, it couldn’t 
have been more than a nudge the 
wrong way during your reactivation 
of us that turned me from the con- 
summate genius and masterful per- 
sonage that I am into the worst 
actor of any year. This is the subtle 
touch that seems to change nothing 
and changes everything. One will 
hardly be able to point to any single 
element that is changed at all, yet 
the totality will absolutely be 
changed.” 

“What is going on here any- 
how?” John Dragon demanded. 

“The damnable TV news spec- 
tacular. SCIENCE SUPREME, THE 
END OF THE CRACKPOTS is going On 

in thirty seconds,” Cris Benedetti 
said. “It’s to the first audience of 
one billion persons ever. Be angry 
or be easy, Dragon, but be yourself.

The world is going to see this show 
through our eyes and attitudes. We 
msut give the world a really fine 
and new experience. Polarized 
data! The field has hardly been 
touched. One can do many things 
with it.” 

“Mind-worms — we will be mind- 
worms,” Khalid said. “We are 
inside them all. We begin the con- 
quest now and they’ll never know 
what hit them. We ride the current 
of that intuitive river named Phar- 
par. We make the whole world see 
it all through our own elegant eyes. 
1 like that ‘elegant eyes’ part.” 

“But we can’t alter a TV 
program that is going on,” Joe 
Waterwitch protested. “We would 
have to do — ” 

“We are doing,” said Roy Mega. 

“Joe, you’re the dowser and you 
don't know where it’s at,” Bene- 
detti chortled. “Certainly we can 
alter it if we bring our equipment 
and minds and eyes to bear.” 

I t was quite a good TV Spectacu- 
lar. SCIENCE SUPREME. THE END 

of the crackpots was the first 
presentation ever to have more than 
one billion viewers. It was a 
program that people would remem- 
ber — it would affect them for the 
rest of their lives. 

It wasn’t quite what had been ex- 
pected. The crackpots — they came 
through as the entrenched inner 
sanctum boys. It took a lot of cour- 
age for the scientific community to 



confess to such weaknesses in itself. 

And some of the things that you 
had always thought of as a little bit 
fringe, ah, they got the open-door 
welcome here. A few of them set 
you and the whole world thinking 
on new lines. There has to be some- 
thing to them: there has to be a lot 
to several of them. Take that new 
para-archeology, that especially. 
By a combination of electronics and 
human minds, great hunks of the 
past are really recreated. Old 
ghosts walk and they do not look 
ghostly at all. 

And often, in the electronics 
building there, a glance at the 
check-set to see from what rough 
rocks these men present had fash- 
ioned such elegant gems! That ori- 
ginal had been rough and intol- 
erant. It had been smothering and 
shriveling. But the check-set was 
not seen by the billion, only by the 
seven. 

Oh, but the great and gracious 
modification which now became 
the prime original. (Yes, the Noble 
Thing itself was bruised a bit when 
the modification tore through the 
old encrustations, but noble things 
are always tough enough to survive: 
and now, for a while, it was no 
longer smothered and shriveled.) 

But the final, elegant, polarized 
presentation was like an old prom- 
ise fulfiled, like a hidden river re- 
discovered. It was an unfolding, a 
full-flowing. It was finally to see all 
dimensions of time and space with 
the elegant eye. ★

The Earth he had sought to 
change had fled him— all 
but one last corner of it! 




PETER TATE 

he overgrown and choking 
garden was shaped like a guitar 
with a hedge of pure Gibson box; 
the jaded, magnificent dying room 
was furnished in Spanish cherry- 
wood ; he slept last night in a Fender 
cutaway and, sweet Pete Seeger, 
even his home telephone exchange 
had twelve strings. 

Jacob Grass. Gone today, maybe 
here tomorrow. The world stopped 
listening and advancing years im- 
paled the minstrel. He calls himself 
a victim of bad taste but in actuality 
it was just the taste, any taste, new 
taste, that polished him off. 

Jacob Grass with a bowl of hot 
wax upon his knee and golden 
hands working in it, salvaging the 
joints, dispelling the cramps for a 
small while. 

Then the digits came up like 
candles and he toweled them clean 
and reached for his peeling Gal- 
lacher. Jacob was going to sing his 
song before finger warmth and all 
daylight went. Daylight was vital, 
though jie played with his eyes shut. 
In darkness he could not see to mix 
the wax. 

How do you equate an active tele- 
phone exchange with a lifeless elec- 
tric system? Jacob Grass had no 
lights, which he needed, and a 
dozen primed lines which he did 
not. Why? 

Hope. 



120 



Hope doesn’t need light but it 
does need contact. Jacob had 
heaved himself clear of the Nash- 
ville debris and headed for Holly- 
wood with some idea about his and 
the old dear’s dying together. Find- 
ing a place was easy enough — their 
doors were open and begging along 
upper Hollywood Boulevard when 
he had been expecting to hike deep 
into the Cheviot hills. 

The Haunted House, some seer of 
the sixties had called Hollywood, 
and that was just how it was now — 
only more so, with the rest of the 
midway packed up and gone and the 
squat hulks hardly holding up 
under the weight of the winter. 

And to find here a dwelling so 
given over to the motif of his heart — 
that was more than good fortune. 
That was the beginning of hope. 

So the phones stayed, though the 
power company came and looked at 
the ghost town and then sent . an 
in-spectre to scare Jacob into paying 
his bill. One look at Jacob, though, 
and they knew it wasn’t worth the 
legal trouble because you can’t get 
blood from a rocking horse. 

Maybe they were even plotting 
with the phone company but some- 
thing kept Grass safe and whenever 
he picked up his handpiece, the 
buzz invitation was there, sure and 
penetrative, meaning, Your call, 
sir? 

Likely * there was an engineer 
somewhere along the lines who 
remembered Jacob Grass with af- 
fection for the songs that had said 



all that the engineer had always 
wanted to say about war, women, 
work or whimsy. 

No doubt about it, Jacob had 
spoken with the tongue of tongues 
once upon a merry time. Now he 
composed to himself and swore be- 
cause the rhymes were ragged or the 
meter didn't run true. 

Jacob Grass and Hollyw’ood. A 
strong affinity and the only affinity 
you would find here . 

The people walked out on Jacob. 
The people walked out on their cel- 
luloid dreams. Time had been when 
Fox, Warner, Universal could dic- 
tate the direction for mass escapism 
with only a limited number of other 
choices. But now, at the thin end of 
the millennium, there were so many 
brands of reality and so many eyes 
with which to view them that dreams 
were redundant. 

For instance, in a typical day: 

The Northlands Satellite was 
beaming the survival struggle of a 
crashed plane crew' in the Arctic 
Circle by daily episodes. Any time — 
maybe tomorrow, folks — the pilot, 
dragging his broken leg, was going 
to start hacking chunks off his dead 
Eskimo passenger or the copilot or 
the beautiful mortified stewardess 
for fresh meat and strength. 

Spangles McGraw was plugging 
his/her latest crunch every time you 
turned up your transvestite radio. 

There was Show Your Cards , an 
extravaganza from Central Africa 
where the Malawi Young Pioneers 
had lined up another round dozen

unpolitical animals and were pro- 
ceeding to burn their homes, pillage 
their limbs and wreck their wives 
just to see how much it took to make 
the dissidents join the Party. 

Seoul Brothers, the recruiting 
splurge from the Indo-China the- 
ater, was always good for a laugh. 

You could watch people dying on 
a dozen different channels, near 
and far, traffic control or Skylab 
mortality quotient. 

With all that, who needed fan- 
tasy? The cameramen had gone to 
the top of the pile. There was even If 
It Kills Me ... a kind of television 
consequence game that used up its 
production staff like crazy because 
the title was the sum total of the 
scenario. And Hollywood continued 
deserted, left to wraiths like Jacob 
Grass who came to stay forever 
while ancient stardusts drifted in 
doorways. 

The same manifestation. Jacob 
had sung protest songs and the en- 
lightened had listened . But the mass 
had gloried in the very things he de- 
cried and he bothered them. Crazy 
Jacob. Chase him away. And kill off 
his listeners. All flesh was not 
Grass. 

I'm the man who taught the 
people 

How to think before they sing. 

How to look for little hitches 

And examine everything. 

S omebody moved upon the 
thickening grime of the boule- 



vard. A young man tensed to the 
sound — a faint jangling like a music 
box in a high and distant room. 

He put his weight against the 
fluted magnificence of the gate. Its 
rustings came away on his glinting 
hands and his fibrous suit but it 
gave inward and before he was three 
paces up the path the oxide had 
been shaken off like sand. 

Following the music to its source, 
he skirted spent azalea bushes, trod 
carefully upon fissured mosaic and 
came at last past a fall of bougain- 
villea to a patio and an open french 
door. 

By which time the guitar had 
stopped. 

Jacob Grass had heard no 
footsteps save his own for a long 
time. Suppliers of sustenance stop- 
ped their vehicles to unload cartons 
at his gate. Mailmen opened his box 
and collected the small checks for 
the butcher, the baker and the 
candle-w'ax maker. The other 
envelopes — the offers of work and 
the fan letters he had written to him- 
self — they authorized with a hand- 
stamp and replaced. All out of his 
earshot. 

But now there were footsteps. 
And stepping from light into gloom, 
a young man of slightly soiled ele- 
gance with a miracle looped to his 
wrist. Jacob Grass knew a camera 
when he saw one. 

“Well, for crying out loud,” said 
the young man. “A living soul. Dr. 
Living Soul, I presume.” 

Words crawled in Jacob's throat 



122 



GALAXY 



but were reluctant to be uttered. A 
second voice, suddenly. 

Let it speak its fill and let me 
listen. 

The young man chuckled and 
panned the room with his eyes, 
cutting from pool of shadow to 
splash of light, sunfall to gyrating 
column of dust. 

“Are you at one with this place, 
dad? Is it yours or do you squat?” 
Jacob found expression at last. 
“It’s mine.” 

“How long? Mercy, I never 
thought to find anybody actually 
still here. Then I heard a guitar. 
You got records?” 

"I’ve got fingers,” said Jacob. 
The Gallacher lay across his legs 
and only now the intruder’s vision 
was coming around to him. 

“You mean you play?” 

“I play.” Jacob didn’t like the 
way the kid said it, as though there 
were some dishonor involved. 
“Here?” 

“Nowhere else.” 

“But why?” 

“Because I want to.” 

“What are you doing here?” 
“What is anybody doing any- 
where except waiting to die?” 
“Wait a minute — do you mean to 
say you’re — like — in sight of 
death?” 

Jacob couldn’t see the point of the 
questions and the boy was super- 
cilious, anyway. “What if I am?” 
“Well, maybe I can help you.” 
“To die? No thanks. That’s one 
job I keep for myself.” 



“No, pop. Don’t misread me. 
What I mean is — somebody at a low 
ebb like that. Sometimes it helps to 
have a friend. Like to push the tide 
back.” 

“You mixed your metaphors. I 
notice that. I keep it out of my 
lyrics.” 

“Lyrics?” 

“Songs. I have written songs that 
are loved the world over.” 

“Great. Are you David or 
Bacharach, Killjoy or Vespucci?” 
“Jacob Grass." 

“Jacob Grass?” 

“Do you know the name?” 
“Sure I know it. Ah — folk 
songs . ” H e could tell by the acoustic 
guitar. 

“Protest.” 

“Protest, I meant.” 

“There’s a difference.” 

“I appreciate that. Dylan made 
the point — ” 

“Listen, I had more to say and I 
said it better — ” 

“Of course you did, Jacob. But 
just the same, now you’re — ” 
“Dying?” 

“Living. Living, Jacob, here in 
this — string mausoleum. People 
should know.” 

“They’ll know soon enough. I get 
offers all the time. It’s just a matter 
of picking the right one.” 

The young man was aiming his 
Minolta, swinging it hither and 
thither, testing black-box attach- 
ments that set him right for film 
speed and aperture as he dry-shot 
darkness, light and Jacob Grass.

“I know I can help you,” he said. 
“I have some friends who would be 
transported by this old house and 
you and — and the whole scene. Do 
you mind if I bring them?” 

“Do you have a name?” 

“Sure — forgive me, Jacob. Cle- 
ments, my name is — Asa Clements. 
It’s kind of funny — like you get 
'ASA' on films? Or maybe you 
don’t know that.” 

“Asa Clements?” 

“Do you know the name?” 

“Of course. You take pictures.” 
He could tell by the camera. 
“You’re playing a game, Jacob.” 
“Your game, Asa. You don’t 
know me from a bag of grit.” 
“That’s not true, Mr. Grass. And 
let me tell you — before long people 
will be falling over themselves to get 
to know you.” 

“With your pictures.” 

“Maybe a little of the glitter will 
rub off on me, yes.” 

“So tell your friends. There’ll be 
enough glitter for all.” 

Past the bougainvillea, across the 
cracked tiles, through the barren 
bushes to the gate, Asa Clements 
was counting his friends. Not the 
ones he had, because he had none. 
But the ones he was going to make 
as a lone wolf cameraman with some 
off-beat footage. 

The networks beckoned. Asa 
went to sell his project and beg some 
film. 

I'm the man who told the people 
Life is not what it appears. 



Media lie and they've been 
Doing it for years. 

C ontrol room subdued of illu- 
mination and numbers crawl- 
ing like flies upon one wall while 
above them Amazon natives fried a 
missionary in high color. Mr. 
Gianni Intermezzo was post-synch- 
ing birds with their songs, cicadas 
with their rattles, screams with their 
sources. 

“And you say this man is dying?” 
He did hot hesitate in his work. Cut, 
thrust, splice, run and all the time 
the jungle sounds were learning to 
be punctual. 

“He says he’s dying,” said Asa 
Clements, “and that makes it more 
authoritative. Just a thousand feet, 
taken at the proper time, would do 
it, Mr. Intermezzo.” 

“Why come to me?” 

“Because you’re the best.” 

“The best what? The best push- 
over?” 

“I’m not asking for a handout, 
Mr. Intermezzo. I’m seeking the 
wherewithal for a project that will 
do you far more good than it will 
ever do me. Slap your name all over 
it but just give me camera credit.” 
“How certain are you this — 
Grass — won’t welsh on us?” 
“Welsh on us?” 

“Carry on living. Waste our 
endeavors.” 

“Because he volunteered the in- 
formation without knowing who I 
was.” 

“Does he know now?” 



124 



GALAXY 



“Of course not. What do you 
think I am, Mr. Intermezzo?” 

“Would you believe a vulture?” 

“I’m a buzzard in a buzzard 
world, Mr. Intermezzo, and any- 
body who tries to pass himself off as 
anything else is just airs and 
graces.” 

Clements watched the airs and 
graces on the flickering wall. The 
woodland fire was burning low and 
some of the natives were risking 
their soles to prod the crackling 
body at the stake. His stomach 
turned. As a defense against 
nausea, his mind put up one of the 
maxims beloved of his profession: If 
you don't like the heat, stay out of 
the kitchen. But suppose, Harry S. 
Truman, that the kitchen covered 
the world. 

Intermezzo watched on, un- 
moved. 

“What — ” Clements swallowed. 
“What do they do next?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Nothing? Don’t they eat him 
or — some kind of ritual?” 

“What for?” 

“Well, it's — I thought it was their 
practice — " 

“They don’t need practice.” 

“I mean — their custom. What’s 
expected of them.” 

“Where’s the thrill in the 
expected?” 

“I’m not sure we’re talking the 
same language, Mr. Intermezzo. 
Where’s the thrill in doing no- 
thing?” 

The film was backtracking now, 



over the treetops, higher and higher 
until the river was a ribbon and the 
jungle was unbroken. The incident 
and the lost life were gone as simply 
as that, like a pebble beneath the 
surface of the sea. Intermezzo let 
the question hang until fadeout. 

“All right,” he said. “Because we 
may do business I’ll honor you with 
a context. How to make sense of this 
scenario. The missionary was burn- 
ing at the stake. Why?” 

“I — ” Clements stumbled. “I — 
guess they didn’t like what he said.” 
“What did he say?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe he made 
vague promises.” 

Intermezzo lit up his workroom 
and grinned. “You’re getting the 
picture. Would you say that was 
enough reason to kill a man?” 
“I’ve heard of slighter reasons.” 
“In the context.” 

“No.” 

“Then what are they doing?” 
“Putting him to the test?” 
“Splendid. And what were the 
alternatives?” 

“They could kill him or let him 
live.” 

“You’re going away from the 
story. They’ve mounted the test. 
What then?” 

“When the fire’s lit — he can only 
die.” 

“Perhaps he claimed differently.” 
“Then he’s a fool. There’s only 
one likelihood. The rest are im- 
possible.” 

"Even with faith?” 

“Faith doesn’t make the steam-

roller jump over you. It just helps 
you to know whether what you’re 
dying for is worth it.” 

“That's more profound than I ex- 
pected, Mr. Clements. I am begin- 
ning to like you.” 

“I’m gratified, Mr. Intermezzo, 
but I’m not sure I grasp your 
meaning.” 

“Think about it. You see, that 
film finished where it did because 
the natives had made their point. No 
melodrama, no special effects, no 
impossibilities. That’s what I call 
integrity. And when I give you five 
hundred feet of film, it’s what I 
want.” 

“But that’s barely enough to — ” 

‘‘Keep a record? It’s all you 
need. There'll be no second take. 
Pick your moment and economize, 
Mr. Clements. Economy is a great 
virtue. And listen: when I talk 
about integrity I mean integrity and 
about integrity 1 mean integrity 
from Jacob Grass and integrity 
from you.” 

“You’ll get it,” said Clements 
weakly. 

Intermezzo stabbed his thumb at 
the blank screen wall. “Make your

asa Clements answered to Gianni 
Intermezzo. Intermezzo step- 
ped to a different drummer. He 
locked up the control room, donned 
a polaroid visor against the intensity 
of the downtown Los Angeles light 
and headed for the nearest holo- 
gram terminal. 

There he dialed his sponsor, no 
less than Frank Baker, the protein 
billionaire. No chance of getting to 
Baker, of course, but today was a 
good day. He came within three 
doors of the top. The man whose 
foreshortened features shaped up 
on the hologram link was Charles 
Natchez, a well advanced chief of 
staff he had met before. Natchez 
remembered the movies with affec- 
tion and kept a soft spot for flotsam 
like Intermezzo. 

“Gianni,” he said. “Always a 
pleasure.” 

“Pleasure’s all mine,” conceded 
Intermezzo. "Charles, I have set an 
item in motion.” 

“Well, you know we respect your 
judgment, Gianni.” 

“My judgment’s all right. I’m 
calling to apprise you, is all. I can't 
give you a completion date, al- 
though the feeling I have is that this 
is a quickie.” 

‘‘How many reels, Gianni?” 
Natchez loved the chance to get into 
the vernacular. 

“I advanced the boy five hundred 
feet of film. It should be more than 



126

enough for the project he has in 
mind.” 

“Are you going to tell me about 
it?” 

“This old folk-singer. Name of 
Jacob Grass.” 

“Jacob Grass — ” 

“You know him?” 

“I can’t be sure. I’m just making 
a note.” 

“Well, 1 know him and I 
remember he used to be good. There 
could be some beautiful things 
said — ” 

“Not too many, Gianni. Not in 
five hundred feet.” 

“Forgive me, Charles. But I know 
my limitations. Twist it anyway you 
like, it doesn't take long to say, 
‘I’m dead'.” 

“And you believe he’ll do this?” 

“Naturally.” 

“And mean it. We have to have 
the action, Gianni.” 

“I am assured he has no stamina 
to change his mind even if he had 
the intention.” 

“Just the same, he’ll have to be 
checked in the usual way — checked 
that his insurance is paid up, that he 
has no friends who might dissuade 
him, that his medical degeneration 
is rapid, that he actually wants to 

go-” 

“My contact claims all these re- 
quirements are fulfilled. Grass is 
tired of living.” 

The head of Natchez, projected 
there at the mouth of the tube like a 
genie, blinked and nodded. Inter- 
mezzo had an insane desire to reach 



out for the image, tear the head 
from its moorings, smash it to the 
floor just to see what happened. But 
he kept his hands out of sight, 
knowing it was an impossible 
murder. There would be no more 
effect than a flickering of colors on 
his swinging fists and, more, 
Natchez would see the movement 
and recognize the intention. It’s 
hard to go on talking business to a 
man when you’ve just proved you’d 
like to kill him. Intermezzo kept his 
hands and his thoughts out of sight. 

Natchez was still nodding. “You 
know it only takes a good idea to 
change a person's mind in these cir- 
cumstances.” 

“That’s a gamble I’ll take. 
Believe me, if there was a good idea 
to be had, Jacob Grass would have 
had it. I’ll organize the usual safe- 
guards.” 

“Otherwise — ” Charles Natchez 
laughed and brought his hands over 
the edge of his desk. Intermezzo 
could see them there in miniature, 
like moth wings. Then the little 
hands were sweeping across the ex- 
panse of the image. Muscles tight- 
ened in his neck as he realized what 
Natchez was doing. What he could 
not afford to do. “Otherwise,” 
chuckled the genie, “heads will 
roll.” 

I'm the man who thought the

I t he telephone rang. It shud- 
dered the ancient chandeliers 
until they shed dust like rain upon 
the startled house. It jerked Jacob 
Grass’s hands so that he spilled 
molten wax upon the dull tile floor 
and put his feet in it and toppled be- 
fore he knew what he should do 
about the phone. 

And it kept ringing. 

Asa Clements, at the other end, 
reasoned that Jacob was finishing a 
solo or mesmerized in some other 
form and waited while motes fell 
and Jacob cursed and scrabbled. 
Waited and thought how kind he 
was. 

Eventually: “The Jacob Grass 
residence. Who wishes to consult 
with him, please?” Grass doing his 
wrinkled retainer bit. 

“I w'anted to speak with Mr. 
Grass if he is not too busy,” said 
Clements, grinning at his owrn so- 
phistication. “My name is Cle- 
ments. He may remember me.” 

He had to remember — it was only 
the day after. 

"The man with the camera." The 
voice was the same. Grass had 
wearied of the game. “Of course I 
remember you, Mr. Clements. I 
wasn’t expecting you to phone.” 
Jacob had not been expecting 
anybody to phone. For some reason 
he had had the cameraman ear- 
marked as someone who would 
come through the french door again 
next time. All the same he was 



curious. He hastened to amend and 
explain. “What I meant was, I 
didn’t realize you had my number. 
Is it — ” 

Clements read him. “Yes, it’s 
listed, Mr. Grass. Large black 
capitals: JACOB GRASS, PRO- 
TEST SINGER, HOLLYWOOD 
BOULEVARD. It looks just fine.” 
He had taken the number off the 
hand-unit at the house. 

“You lie too easily, Asa,” said 
Grass. “You lie for almost no reason 
at all." 

“I — ” Clements dried up. 

“You what? Were you going to 
deny it? Were you going to com- 
pound your felony?” 

Five hundred feet of film and Asa 
Clements had been wondering 
whether it would be enough. The 
danger now was that he would not 
get to use any of it. 

“I’m sorry,” he said. “I — I try to 
be kind. If an old man has a dream 1 
try not to spoil it or trample on it. In 
this ghost town the directory is full 
of dead numbers, Jacob. I thought 
you knew that and I was echoing 
your charade. Don’t think too badly 
of me. I have some good new's.” 
“Is it the truth?” 

“It is as good as that. I have been 
invited to make a film about you.” 
“What do they want me to 
do — jump off the roof? I’m afraid I 
couldn’t climb up there.” 

“No, Jacob. A film about the way 
you live. Your songs. It could do 
you a lot of good, bring you a lot 
more work."

“Are you still trying to humor me, 
Asa? I see films. They all have one 
ending these days.” 

“Truly, Jacob.” Well, he could 
put it in a way that wasn’t too much 
of a hypocrisy. “I have five hundred 
feet of film to use on you. You can 
do what you like, say what you 
like — play what you like. And if my 
contact likes the result there could 
be more footage. Don’t say you 
wouldn’t enjoy being a star again.” 
Jacob Grass looked down at the 
cute little receiver in his hand and 
wondered if he could be brave 
enough to replace it on its cute little 
stand. The cameraman’s offer was 
seductive, allowing for any and all 
consequences. 

But there were other entirely pro- 
fessional considerations. He needed 
time to think on those. 

“You can’t come here,” he said. 
“I don’t want to see you. The hell 
with your five hundred feet of film — 
and I still have enough strength to 
break a camera.” 

For courage, read cunning, he 
thought as he cradled the receiver. 
Clements would be across the 
ferrous oxide threshold and lurking 
in the shrubbery with very little 
delay because he was already com- 
mitted to Grass. Keeping his 
distance, but waiting his chance, 
Jacob, meanwhile, had all the 
time he wanted to work on his act. 

I'm the man who begged the 
people 

It was truth I had to say. 



But they just turned up their 3 V 
sets 

Until I went away. 

a his last day in the crumb- 
ling mansion, Jacob Grass 
awoke laughing. Hammering life 
back into his stunted hands, laying 
them to thaw in the sunlight upon 
the windowsill, he perceived what he 
could do. 

This very window frame. The 
others around the house. All could 
be utilized. He drew his fingers back 
into the shadows and set them 
searching for screws and driver. 

Twelve screws to the top of each 
frame, grouped in twos, twelve 
screws to the bottom and paired. 
See how far they went. 

And when he had used up his own 
supply of loose screws, he toured 
the house dismantling doors, dis- 
carding mirrors and pictures and 
handles. He vandalized fine furni- 
ture for the small spirals that kept 
it together. He plundered comforts 
for the joints that made them so. 

And in the end, ten window 
frames were studded top and 
bottom, couple by couple. 

So much for the mechanics. Now 
for the art. 

He used half his remaining supply 
of wax to resupple his hands and 
kept the rest for a more vital pur- 
pose. As hunched as Quasimodo, he 
scaled the stairs to the attic and 
broke open a box that bore its age in 
cobwebs. 

Strings. Curled, looped, plaited. 



PROTEST 



129 



laid flat. Catgut, steel, nylon. 
Knotted together, they could reach 
the moon but Jacob Grass needed 
them as individuals. All bore small 
labels identifying their key. He 
shoved and pummeled the box to 
the top of the stairway and dragged 
it to the first floor. 

Then he started on the first 
window. 

Working from left to right, a bass 
string and then a treble wound at 
either end around a screw — 
E,A,D,G,B,E. 

He left them slack and moved on 
to the next window — Bass E, Treble 
E , BassA, TrebleA, Bass D, Treble 
D and on into G and B and E again. 

Moving on. Take a pair of laugh- 
ing Es, a brace of As, a deuce of 
Ds . 

He made a song out of it. Not up 
to his usual standard, maybe, but 
then the lyrics were not important — 
this time he would use no lyrics. 

Five windows strung and Jacob 
Grass was humming. Seven win- 
dows and Jacob was gritting teeth 
against the pain in his paws. Ten 
windows done and now came the 
tough part, the part that cried out 
for craftsmanship. 

His strings needed wax but so did 
he. And if his fingers didn’t get it, 
the strings never would. He split the 
small block in two again, made it 
liquid before the fire, laid his digits 
to rest. 

It was mid-afternoon and he 
hadn’t eaten, his stomach told him. 
He committed his hands to the towel 



hurriedly and scrambled for bread 
and cheese, not heeding the extra 
taste from the remnants of wax. 

Leaving the morsels unfinished, 
he returned to the windows with the 
screwdriver and began tuning — one 
twist to top, one twist to bottom and 
pluck and listen. Little by little, 
Bass if . Up a tone, little by little and 
Treble 2L To A, to D, a tone apart; 
G to B, an octave span, B to top E 
the same. He was less than satisfied 
overall because even the give of the 
wood in the frames robbed the 
chords of accuracy. Perhaps he 
sought too much, perhaps his ears 
were only accustomed to perfection. 

He ran his hand across the width 
of the window. The effect was 
mellifluous and melodic. His throat 
knotted and his eyes stung. 

The second window. As good and 
easy as the first. 

'the third needed more time and 
he knew chill fear as the sun began 
its downward arc. The fourth came 
right as simply as the first two. The 
fifth had woodworm in the frame 
and try as he might, Jacob could 
only achieve a bass sound from his 
treble strings and a dry, dead, rope 
twang from the bass. 

He moved on, aware that he had 
wasted too much time. Sixth, 
seventh and eighth windows per- 
formed admirably. On the ninth, 
three feverish screws had been 
forced in against the thread and 
refused to budge. The whole was a 
mess because they broke up the 
chord.

Tenth — and Jacob was doubled 
over with the pain in his wrists. He 
cursed arthritis, cursed the waning 
wax, screamed at his own mad- 
ness — and came up with a bridge as 
clear and true as the best he had ever 
fingered. Hearing it thus, he whis- 
pered, “I love you — ” to the faithful 
catgut and blessed the numbness 
that had been an anesthetic to his 
tattered hands. 

His blood on the guitar strings at 
every window. His stain on every 
note they played, ever. 

There had been no hint or 
whisper of Asa Clements all day, but 
he knew the boy was out there 
biding his time and conserving his 
footage. 

“Tonight,” he shouted at the 
darkening garden. “Bring your 
friends tonight." 

Then he sat down to wait for a 
breeze. 

And the world goes on burning 
just the same, 

So I guess I'm going to have to 
take the blame . 

No, there’s no other hand out for 
a share. 

I'm the man who bored the world 
too stiff to care. 

T v he night grew jagged with 
noise and the earphone men 
were screaming with the pain and 
the vibe counters were running off 
the dial and Gianni Intermezzo was 
taking Asa Clements by the scruff of 
the neck and hurling him into the 



presence of Jacob Grass. 

The old man was sitting in his up- 
right chair with the Gallacher across 
his knees and his shoulders hunched 
against the open-window cold. 

In the darkness Clements could 
not see the tears along the lines of 
Jacob’s cheeks and Grass wasn’t 
about to tell of his grief when the 
wind had sprung up and rendered 
his Aeolian strings shrill and 
unmelodic, tortured and meaning- 
less. 

Besides, the camera fiend was 
still smarting from Intermezzo’s in- 
vective. Boiled down to the func- 
tional, what he had said was: “Get 
in there and save this production.” 

Clements knew exactly what was 
meant by that and had come with 
Minolta at the ready. Now here was 
Grass sitting in his chair, not 
moving, not even going crazy or 
threshing about. 

“What do you want me to do?” 
The old man asked as loudly as he 
could against the keening wire hum. 

“What?” 

“How do you want me to end it? 
Am I all right here? I can’t move 
very far or very fast now.” 

“Don’t. Not yet.” Desperation 
had removed any subtlety from the 
Clements approach. 

“I mean, that is what you want, 
isn’t it?” 

“No.” 

The chandelier burst apart in a 
crystal blizzard, showering the pair 
of them. Clements, unhurt as he 
stood, brushed splinters from his 



PROTEST

hair and opened a cut in his left 
palm. He sucked at it because this 
gave him something to do but no 
words came with the salt taste. 

“Why don’t you admit it?” 
prodded Grass. “Come on, now that 
truth is inevitable, let me hear you 
say it. Let me go with you being 
honest.” 

“Please, Jacob — ” And the words 
were gone again. A dilemma with- 
out articulation. How do you say. 
You' re not dying the way I want you 
to? 

“Then guide me.” Grass could 
read the pause. 

“Jacob, this noise. It’s tearing me 
apart — ” 

Something fell in an upper room. 
Something slid on the Camelot 
slopes of the roof. 

“Say it, Asa. Say you wanted me 
dead.” 

“What does it matter?” 

“It matters to me what the last 
man I’ll ever speak to is thinking.” 

“You’re neurotic, Jacob. 1 came 
to promote your music, to give you a 
new chance.” 

“And how do you like my hand- 
made synthesizer?” 

“Fantastic. Only it’s ruined 
everything.” 

“Why?” 

“Good grief, man, we can’t 
record the event in this — this bed- 
lam. All our sound instruments are 
going haywire — ” 

Clements could not be sure, but 
he fancied that Jacob Grass 
chuckled. There was too much 



volume. The feel of it was coming 
right up through the floor, climbing 
his legs, jetting up his backbone, 
socking at his brain. “Why your- 
self?” he screamed. “Why go to all 
this trouble?” 

On the upper landing a mirror 
was shaken loose and disintegrated 
before touching the floor. 

Pinpricks sabotaged Clements’ 
eardrums so that he had to struggle 
to hear Jacob’s reply. 

“I thought you were used to 
dealing with professionals.” 

“I am, but what has that — ” 

“Then you should know.” 

Wire-cutters. The simple answer. 
Short work at the windows. The 
peacemaker. Relief swathed Asa 
Clements like cotton wool. 

“I don't know,” he said. “Tell 
me.” 

“A true artist never goes on stage 
without an encore ready.” 

Clements was running for the 
door. 

Jacob set his fingers like a caress 
on the neck of his Gallacher, closed 
his eyes and finished his lifesong 
without fuss or film coverage. 

Clements, back with the tools and 
racing from window to window, 
didn’t even look at the crumbled 
Hollywood man. 

Gianni Intermezzo’s backup 
cameraman got some fine telescopic 
shots of panic and wire-cutters be- 
fore the Hollywood mansion crum- 
bled upon Asa Clements. 

“That’s integrity,” said Mr. 
Intermezzo to the silent night. ★

Part III 



CHRISTOPHER PRIEST 

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

Helward Mann of Earth City has 
reached manhood at the age of six 
hundred and fifty miles. His age is 
reckoned by the city's progress to- 
ward the Optimum — e.g. from the 
moment of Helward ’s birth Earth 
City has traveled six hundred and 
fifty miles toward this elusive goal, 
a process of which Helward knows 
little or nothing. His early years, 
spent in the creche with other city 



children , have been sheltered. His 
education has been Earth oriented 
and has given him little informa- 
tion about the planet the city now 
traverses. 

Following elaborate rites wel- 
coming him to adulthood — at 
which Helward elects to become an 
apprentice of the Future Surveyors' 
jjGuild and his engagement to a girl 
named Victoria Lerouex is an- 
nounced — Helward is permitted to 
see his first sunrise, actually his 
first glimpse of the outside. As- 
signed to serve his initial term as an 
apprentice with the Trackmen's 
Guild, he discovers that the city 
moves forward across the planet's 
surface on rails painstakingly laid 
ahead of it and as painstakingly 
removed once they have served 
their purpose (a) to prevent the 
city’s sliding backward and ( b ) to 
be reused. He also learns that th 
city is fusion-powered and is the 
sole source of the good life on the 
planet — it alone has adequate (if 
tasteless and synthetic) food, cloth- 
ing, medical and educational facili- 
ties. It uses these to barter for 
workers and women to bear 
children — of which it has a short- 
age — from among primitive tribes 
of aliens or “ tooks " en route. The 
women acquired by barter remain 
in the city long enough to bear a 
child to a city male , are then 
returned to their tribes. 

The knowledge of how the city 
came to he is lost. It is, however, 
known that somehow it originated 
on Earth and that, in order to sur- 
vive, it must be winched constantly 
toward the Optimum, which moves 
ahead of it. Instructions to this ef- 



fect are contained in a document 
known as Destain’s Directive, 
handed down from the city’s 
founder in some dim antiquity. 

Ideally the city should progress 
at the rate of one-tenth of a mile a 
day. This pace, however, is never 
maintained — there is uneven ter- 
rain to contend with; rivers and 
gorges must be bridged. The city 
has never been closer than three 
miles to the Optimum. This, how- 
ever, is enough to keep it alive and 
functioning. 

There is discontent both within 
and outside the city. Helward ex- 
periences both. Victoria, whom he 
has married , finds her life in urban 
confinement pointless. Helward 
has taken an apprentice's oath 
never to discuss the outside or the 
city's relationship to it with the 
uninitiated under penalty of death. 
To save his marriage, however, he 
breaks his vow in conversations 
with Victoria. He also is involved 
and injured in a riot of resentful 
“took" workers, 

A fter serving his apprenticeship 
Helward is sent south — into the 
city's “past" — to escort home three 
local women for whose child- hear- 
ing services the city has bartered to 
alleviate its woman- short age. He 
discovers that the landscape that 
should have been familiar to him 
from the city's passage has subtly 
altered — a ravine the city had 
bridged with great difficulty has 
shrunk to a mere ditch; mountains 
have lost height. The terrain has 
flattened out and the tracks of the 
city's passing have spread out. 

The three women with him also 
seem to grow shorter and broader

until they split their dresses and 
must proceed naked. He himself re- 
mains physically unchanged — but 
discovers himself experiencing a 
strange force pulling him south- 
ward .

S hortly before they moved on 
Rosario tried to speak to him. 
He had difficulty understanding 
her. Her accent was strong in any 
case, and now her voice was pitched 
high and she spoke too quickly. 

After many attempts he got the 
gist of what she was saying. 

She and the other girls were 
afraid to return to their village. 
They were of the city now and 
would be rejected by their own 
kind. 

Helward said they must go on, as 
had been their choice, but Rosario 
said they would not move. She was 
married to a man in her village and, 
although at first she had wanted to 
return to him, she thought now he 
would kill her. Lucia, too, was 
married and shared the fear. The 
people of the villages hated the city 
and for their involvement with it 
the girls would be punished. 

Helward gave up trying to answer 
Rosario. He was having as much 
difficulty making her understand 
as he had in comprehending her. 
After all, the girls had entered the 
city willingly in the first place as 
part of the barter. He tried to say 
so, but she could not understand. 

Even while they had been talking 
the process of change had continu- 
ed. She was now a little more than 



twelve inches high and her body 
was nearly five feet wide. It was im- 
possible to recognize her or the 
other girls as human, even though 
he knew they were. 

He said, “Wait here.” 

He stood up and fell again, 
rolling across the ground. The force 
on his body was now much greater 
and he stopped himself w r ith great 
difficulty. He crawled back against 
the force to his pack and pulled it 
on. He found the rope and slung it 
over his shoulder. 

Bracing himself against the pres- 
sure, he walked south. 

tt was no longer possible to make 
I out any natural features other 
than the line of rising ground 
ahead. The surface on which he 
walked was now' an indistinct blur 
and although he stopped to exam- 
ine it from time to time he could 
distinguish nothing on it that might 
once have been grass, rocks or soil. 

The natural features of the world 
were distorting — they were spread- 
ing laterally to east and w r est, 
diminishing in height and depth. 

A boulder here might be a strip 
of dark gray, one hundredth of an 
inch wide and tw'o hundred yards 
long. The low, snow-capped ridge 
ahead might be mountains — that 
long strip of green a tree. 

That narrow strip of off-white, a 
naked woman. 

H e reached the higher ground 
more quickly than he had an- 
ticipated. The pull toward the 
south was intensifying and when 
Helward was less than fifty yards 
from the nearest hill he stumbled — 



INVERTED WORLD 



135 



and was rolling with an ever-in- 
creasing speed toward it. 

The northern face was almost 
vertical, like the leeward side of a 
wind-blown dune, and he collided 
hard with it. Almost at once the 
southward pressure was pulling 
him up the face, defying gravity. In 
desperation, for he knew if he 
reached the top the pressure on him 
could never be resisted, he scram- 
bled for a hold on the rock-hard 
face. It came in the form of an out- 
jutting spur. Helward grabbed it 
with both hands, desperately hold- 
ing himself back against the relent- 
less pressure. His body swung 
around until he was lying vertically 
against the wall, feet above his 
head, knowing that if he slipped 
now he would be taken backward 
up the slope and on down toward 
the south. 

He reached behind into his pack 
and found the grapple. He lodged it 
firmly under the spur, attached the 
rope to it and wound the other end 
around his wrist. 

The southward pressure was 
now so great upon him that the nor- 
mal downward pull of gravity was 
virtually negated. 

T he substance of the mountain 
was changing beneath him. The 
hard, almost vertical wall was slow- 
ly widening to east and west and 
flattening, so that behind him the 
summit of the ridge appeared to be 
creeping down toward him. He saw 
a cleft in the rock beside him gradu- 
ally closing and removed the 
grapple from under the spur and 
thrust it into the cleft. Moments 
later the grapple was securely held. 



T he summit of the ridge had now 
distended and was beneath his 
body. The southward pressure took 
him and he was swept over the 
ridge. The rope held and he was 
suspended horizontally. 

What had been the mountain be- 
came a hard protuberance beneath 
his chest. His stomach lay in what 
had been the valley beyond. His 
feet scrambled for a hold against 
the diminishing ridge of what had 
once been another mountain. 

He was flat along the surface of 
the world, a giant recumbent across 
an erstwhile mountain region. 



H e raised his body, trying to 
ease his position. Lifting his 
head, he suddenly found he was 
short of breath. A hard, icy wind 
blew from the north, but it was thin 
and short of oxygen. He lowered his 
head again, resting his chin on the 
ground. At this level his nose could 
take air that would sustain him. 

It was bitterly cold. 

There were clouds and borne on 
the wind they skimmed a few inches 
above the ground like a white un- 
broken sheet. They surged around 
his face, flowing around his nose 
like foam at the bow of a ship. 

His mouth was below r them — his 
eyes were above. 

Helward looked ahead of him 
through the thin, rarefied atmos- 
phere above the clouds. He looked 
to the north. 

He was at the edge of the world — 
its bulk lay before him. 

He could see the whole world. 
North of him the terrain w r as 
level, flat as the top of a table. But 



136 



GALAXY 



at the center, due north of him, the 
ground rose from that flatness in a 
perfectly symmetrical, rising and 
curving concave spire. It narrowed 
and narrowed, reaching up, grow- 
ing ever more slender, rising so 
high that it was impossible to see 
where it ended. 

He saw it in a multitude of 
colors. There were broad areas of 
brown and yellow, patched with 
green. Farther north lay a blue- 
ness — pure sapphire, bright on the 
eyes. Over it all, the white of clouds 
in long, tenuous whorls, in brilliant 
swarms, in flaky patterns. 

The sun was setting. Red to the 
northeast, it glowed against the im- 
possible horizon. 

The shape of it was the same. A 
broad flat disk that might be an 
equator. At its center and to north 
and south its poles existed as rising, 
concave spires. 

Helward had seen the sun so 
often that he no longer questioned 
its appearance. But now he knew 
that the world, too, was that shape. 

XIX 

T he sun set and the world 
became dark. 

The southward pressure was now 
so great that his body hardly 
touched what had once been the 
mountains beneath him. He was 
hanging on the rope in the dark- 
ness, as if vertically against the wall 
of a cliff — reason told him that he 
was still horizontal, but reason was 
in conflict with sensation. 

He could no longer trust tHe 
strength of the rope. Helward 
reached forward, curled his finger- 



tips around two small extrusions 
(had they once been mountains?) 
and hauled himself forward. 

The surface beyond was smooth- 
er and he could hardly find a firm 
hold. With trouble he discovered he 
could dig his fingers into the 
ground sufficiently to obtain a tem- 
porary purchase. He dragged him- 
self forward again — a matter of 
inches, but in another sense a 
matter of miles. The southward 
pressure did not perceptibly dimin- 
ish. 

H e abandoned his rope and 
crawled forward by hand. An- 
other few inches and his feet came 
into contact with the low ridge that 
had been the mountain. He pressed 
hard, moved forward again. 

Gradually the pressure on him 
began to decrease until it was no 
longer a matter of desperation to 
hold on. Helward relaxed for a mo- 
ment, trying to catch his breath. 
Even as he did so he felt sure that 
the pressure was increasing again, 
so he moved forward. Soon he had 
gone so far that he could rest on his 
hands and knees. 

He had not looked south. What 
had been behind him? 

YJ E crawled a long way before 
1 he felt able to stand. He did 
so, leaning northward to counteract 
the force. He walked forward, feel- 
ing the inexplicable drag steadily 
diminish. He soon felt he was suffi- 
ciently far from the worst zone of 
pressure to sit on the ground and 
take a proper rest. 

He looked to the south. All was 
darkness. The clouds which had 



INVERTED WORLD 



137 



broken around his face were now 
some height above him. They oc- 
cluded the moon, which Helward, 
in his untutored way, had never 
questioned. It too was that strange 
shape — he had seen it many times 
and had always accepted it. 

He continued walking north, 
feeling the immense drag weaken- 
ing. The landscape around him was 
dark and featureless and he paid no 
attention to it. Only one thought 
dominated his mind — before he 
rested he must move sufficiently far 
not to be dragged back again to 
that zone of pressure. He knew now 
a basic truth of this world — the 
ground was indeed moving as 
Codings had said. Up north, where 
the city existed, the ground moved 
with an almost imperceptible slow- 
ness: about one mile in a period of 
ten days. But farther south it 
moved faster and its acceleration 
was exponential. He had seen it in 
the way the bodies of the girls had 
changed: in the space of one night 
the ground had moved sufficiently 
far for their bodies to be affected by 
the lateral distortions to which 
they — and not he — were subjected. 

The city could not rest. It was 
destined to move forever, because if 
it halted it would start the long slow 
movement down here — down past — 
where it would come eventually to 
the zone where mountains became 
ridges a few inches high, where an 
irresistible pressure would sweep it 
to its destruction. 

At that moment, as he walked 
slowly northward across the strange, 
dark terrain, he could give no ra- 
tionale to what he had experienced. 
Everything conflicted with logic. 



Ground was stable — it could not 
move. Mountains did not distort. 
Human beings did not become 
twelve inches high. Chasms did not 
narrow. Babies did not choke on 
their mothers’ milk. 

T hough the night was well ad- 
vanced, Helward felt no tired- 
ness beyond the residue of the phy- 
sical strain he had endured on the 
side of the mountain. It occurred to 
him that the day had passed quick- 
ly; faster than he could have 
credited. 

He was well beyond the zone of 
maximum pressure now, but he 
was still too aware of it to halt. It 
was not a pleasant thought to sleep 
while the ground moved beneath 
him, bearing him ineluctably south. 

He was a microcosm of the city. 
He could no more rest than it. 

F atigue seized him at last and 
he sprawled on the hard ground 
and slept. 

He was awakened by the sunrise 
and his first thought was of the 
southward pressure. Alarmed, he 
sprang to his feet and tested his 
balance — the force was there, but 
not measurably worse than it had 
been at his last recollection. 

He looked along his backtrail. 
There, incredibly, the mountains 
stood . 

It could not be so. He had seen 
them, felt them reduce to a ridge of 
hard ground, no more than an inch 
or two in height. Yet they were 
clearly there: steep, irregularly 
shaped, capped w'ith snow'. 

Helward found his pack and 
checked its contents. He had lost 



138 



GALAXY 



the rope and grapple and much of 
his equipment had been with the 
girls when he left them, but he still 
had a canteen of water, a sleeping 
bag and several packets of the de- 
hydrated food. These would keep 
him going for a while. 

He ate a little of the food, then 
strapped his pack in place. 

He glanced up at the sun, deter- 
mined this time to keep his 
bearings. 

He walked south toward the 
mountains. 

The pressure grew about him 
slowly, dragging him forward. As 
he watched the mountains they 
seemed to shrink in height. The 
substance of the soil under his feet 
became thicker and the terrain 
once more began to feature fused 
lateral streaks. 

Overhead, the sun moved faster 
than it had any right to do. 

Fighting against the pressure, 
Helward stopped when he saw that 
the mountains were once again not 
much more than an undulating line 
of low hills. 

He was not equipped to go far- 
ther. He turned and moved north. 
Night fell an hour later. 

H e walked on through the 
darkness until he felt the pres- 
sure was acceptably low, then 
rested. 

When daylight came again the 
mountains were clearly in view — 
and as mountains. 

He waited. As the day advanced 
the pressure grew. He was being 
carried toward the mountains by 
the motion of the ground — and as 
he watched and waited he saw them 



slowly spread laterally. 

He moved his camp north before 
night fell. He had seen enough. It 
was time to return to the city. A 
new thought worried him. Would 
he have to make some kind of re- 
port on what had happened? 

He felt incapable of absorbing 
much of what he had seen into his 
own experience — how could he 
describe it to someone else? 

A focal point had been his stupe- 
fying view of the world spread be- 
fore him. Had any man ever been 
privy to such an experience? How 
could the mind encompass a con- 
cept which the eye had been incap- 
able of translating into reasonable 
visual frames of reference? To his 
left and right — and, for all he 
knew, to the south of him — the sur- 
face of the world had extended 
seemingly without bound. Only in 
the north, due north, had he found 
a definition of form: that curving, 
rising pinnacle of land stretching to 
no visible end. 

The three girls — how could he re- 
port on his having returned them 
safely to their home grounds when 
they had passed into a state in 
which he could not communicate 
with them or even see them? They 
had passed on into their own world, 
utterly alien to him. 

The baby: what had happened to 
it? Manifestly of the city, for it had 
not been affected by the distortions 
of the past, presumably it had been 
abandoned by Rosario — and was 
now presumably dead. Even if it 
still lived, the motion of the ground 
would bear it south to that zone of 
pressure where it could not survive. 

Lost in such thoughts, Helward 



INVERTED WORLD 



139 



walked on, taking little account of 
his surroundings. Only when he 
stopped to take a drink of water did 
he look about — and with a start of 
surprise realize that he recognized 
the terrain. 

This was the rocky land to the 
north of the chasm where the 
bridge had been built. 

He took a few mouthfuls of the 
water, then retraced his steps. If he 
were to find his way back to the city 
he must relocate the tracks, and the 
site of the bridge would be a better 
landmark than most. 

He encountered a stream which, 
in his preoccupied state, he must 
have crossed without noticing. He 
followed its course, wondering if 
this could possibly be the same 
stream, for it appeared to be a tiny 
rivulet. In due time the banks of 
the stream became steeper and 
rougher, but there was no sign of 
the chasm. 

Helward scrambled up the bank 
and walked back against the direc- 
tion of the water-flow. Though nag- 
gingly familiar, the appearance of 
the stream was distended and 
distorted, until he felt it could be 
another stream entirely. 

Then he noticed a long black 
oval near the edge of the water. He 
went down to examine it. He 
caught a faint smell of burning — 
and on closer inspection realized 
this was the scar of a fire. His own 
old campfire. 

The stream at this point was no 
more than a yard wide — yet, when 
he had been here with the girls, it 
had been at least twelve feet across. 
He climbed again to the top of the 
bank. After a long search he found 



some marks on the ground that 
could have been the traces of one of 
the suspension towers. 

From the top of one bank to the 
next the distance could have been 
no more than five or six yards. The 
drop to the water was a matter of 
feet. 

At this point the city had 
crossed. 

He walked north and in a short 
while found the trace of a sleeper. 
It was about seventeen feet long. 
The one next to it was three inches 
away. 

B y the following night the scale 
of the landscape had assumed 
proportions that were more famil- 
iar to him. Trees looked like trees, 
not sprawling bushes. Pebbles were 
round, grass grew in clumps instead 
of looking like a smear of green. 
The tracks he followed were still too 
widely spread to have any resemb- 
lance to the gauge used by the city, 
but Helward thought that his 
journey should not be much longer. 

He had lost track of the number 
of days that had passed, but the 
terrain was becoming increasingly 
familiar to him and he knew that so 
far his time away from the city was 
still considerably less than that pre- 
dicted by Clausewitz. Even taking 
into account the two or three days 
that had seemed to go so quickly 
while he was in the zone of pres- 
sure, the city could not have moved 
more than a mile or two farther to 
the north during his absence. 

This thought encouraged him, 
for his supplies of food and water 
were dwindling. 

He walked on and the days 



140 



GALAXY 



passed. There was still no sign of 
the city and the tracks showed no 
signs of narrowing to their more 
normal gauge. By now he was so ac- 
customed to the notion of the later- 
al distortion of this world in the 
south, that he took the evidence of 
it in stride. 

One morning he was disturbed 
by a new thought. For several days 
the gauge of the tracks had not ap- 
peared to change — could it be that 
he had encountered a region where 
the motion of the ground was 
directly equal to the speed of his 
own walking? Was he like a mouse 
on a treadmill, making no forward 
progress? 

For an hour or two he hastened 
his walk, but soon reason prevail- 
ed. He had, after all, successfully 
moved away from the zone of pres- 
sure where the southward motion 
was greater. But more days passed 
and the city seemed to be no 
nearer. Soon he was down to his 
last two packets of food and twice 
he had had to supplement his water 
supplies from local sources. 

The day he reached the end of his 
food he was suddenly taken by a 
surge of excitement. Potential star- 
vation was no longer a problem — he 
had recognized where he was! This 
was the region he had been riding 
through with Barter Codings — at 
that time, two or three miles north 
of optimum! 

By his estimate of time he had 
been gone for three miles at the 
most — so the city should be in 
sight. 

Up ahead, the line of track-scars 
continued until they reached a low 
ridge — and no sign of the city. The 



sleeper pits were still distorted and 
the next row of scars — the left in- 
ner — was some distance away. 

All it could mean, Helward rea- 
soned, was that while he had been 
away the city had somehow moved 
much faster. Perhaps it had even 
overtaken the optimum and was in 
a region where the ground moved 
more slowly. Already he was begin- 
ning to understand why the city 
moved on: perhaps ahead of opti- 
mum there was a zone where the 
ground did not move at all. 

In which case the city could 
stop — the grand treadmill would 
end. 

XX 

H elward passed a hungry night 
and slept badly. In the morn- 
ing he took a few mouthfuls of 
water and was soon on his way. The 
city had to come into view soon. 

He w'as forced to rest during the 
hottest part of the day. The coun- 
tryside, barren and open, afforded 
little shade. He sat down beside the 
track. 

Staring bleakly ahead, he saw 
something that gave him fresh 
hope — three people were walking 
slowly down the track toward him. 
They must be from the city, sent 
out to find him. He waited for them 
to reach him. 

As they approached he tried to 
stand, but stumbled. He lay still. 
“Are you from the city?” 
Helward opened his eyes and 
looked up at the speaker. He saw a 
young man, dressed in a guild-ap- 
prentice uniform. He nodded, his 
jaw slack. 



INVERTED WORLD 



141 



"You’re ill — what’s the matter?” 
“I’m okay. Have you any food?” 
“Drink this.” 

A canteen of water was offered 
and Helward took a mouthful. The 
water was stale and flat — city 
water. 

“Can you stand?” 

With assistance, Helward rose to 
his feet and walked away from the 
track to where a few scrawny 
bushes grew. Helward sat down on 
the ground and the young man 
opened his pack. With a start of re- 
cognition, Helward realized the 
pack was identical to his own. 

“Do I know you?” he asked. 
“Apprentice Kellen Li-Chen.” 
Li-Chen! He remembered him 
from the creche. “I’m Helward 
Mann.” 

Kellen Li-Chen opened a packet 
of dehydrated food and insinuated 
some water. Soon a familiar por- 
tion of gray porridge was before 
him, and Helward began to eat it. 

In the background, some yards 
away, two girls stood and waited. 

“You’re going down past,” he 
said between mouthfuls. 

“Yes.” 

“I’ve just been.” 

“What’s there?” 

Suddenly, Helward remembered 
meeting Torrold Pelham under al- 
most identical circumstances. 

"You’re down past now,’’ he 
said. “Can’t you feel it?” 

Kellen shook his head. 

“What do you mean?” he said. 
Helward meant the southward 
pressure, the subtle pull of which 
he could still feel as he walked. But 
he understood now that Kellen had 
probably not yet noticed it. Until it 



had been experienced in its ex- 
tremeness, it would not be recog- 
nized as a separate sensation. 

“It’s impossible to talk about it,” 
Helward said. “Go down past and 
you’ll see for yourself.” He glanced 
at the girls. They were sitting on the 
ground, their backs turned quite 
deliberately on the men. He 
couldn’t help smiling to himself. 
“Kellen — how far is the city from 
here?” 

"A few miles back. About five.” 

Five miles! Then by now it must 
have easily overtaken the optimum. 

“Can you give me some food? 
Just a little — enough to get me back 
to the city." 

“Of course.” 

Kellen took four packets and 
handed them over. Helward looked 
at them for a moment, then handed 
three of them back. 

“One will be enough. You’ll need 
the rest.” 

“I haven't got far to go,” said 
Kellen. 

“I know — but you’ll still need 
them.” He looked again at the other 
apprentice. “How long have you 
been out of the creche, Kellen?” 

“About fifteen miles.” 

But Kellen was much younger 
than he. He remembered distinctly 
that Kellen had been two grades 
below him in the creche. The city 
must be recruiting apprentices 
much earlier now. But Kellen 
looked mature and well-filled. His 
body was not that of an adolescent. 

“How old are you?” he said. 

“Six hundred and sixty-five.” 

That couldn’t be so — he was at 
least fifty miles younger than Hel- 
ward, who was by his own reckon - 



142 



GALAXY 



ing six hundred and seventy. 

“Have you been working on the 
tracks?” 

"Yes. Bloody hard work.” 

“I know. How has the city been 
able to move so fast?” 

“Fast? It’s been a bad period. 
We had a river to cross and at the 
moment the city is held up by hilly 
country. We’ve lost a lot of ground. 
When I left it was six miles behind 
optimum.” 

“Six miles? Then the optimum’s 
moved faster?” 

“Not as far as I know.” Kellen 
was looking over his shoulder at the 
girls. “I think I’d better be moving 
on now. Are you all right?” 

“Yes. How are you getting on 
with them?” 

Kellen grinned. 

“Not bad,” he said. “Language 
barriers, but I think I can find a bit 
of common vocabulary.” 

Helward laughed and again re- 
membered Pelham. 

“Make it soon,” he said. “It gets 
difficult later.” 

Kellen Li-Chen stared at him for 
a moment, then stood up. 

“The sooner the better, I think,” 
he said. He went back to the girls, 
who complained loudly when they 
realized their break had been only a 
short one. As they walked past him, 
Helward saw that one of the girls 
had unbuttoned her shirt all down 
the front and had tied it with a 
knot. 

W ith the food Kellen had given 
him, Helward felt certain of 
reaching the city without any 
further problems. After the dis- 
tance he had traveled another five 



miles was as nothing and he antici- 
pated reaching the city by nightfall. 
The countryside around him was 
now entirely new to him: in spite of 
what Kellen had said it certainly 
seemed that the city had made good 
progress during his absence. 

Evening approached and still he 
saw no sign of the city. 

The only hopeful indication was 
that now the scars left by the sleep- 
ers were of more normal dimen- 
sions — the next time Helward 
stopped for water he measured the 
nearest pit and estimated that it 
was about six feet long. 

Ahead of him was rising ground 
and he could see a ridge over which 
the track remains ran. He felt sure 
the city must be lying in the hollow 
beyond and so he pressed on, hop- 
ing for a sight of it before nightfall. 

The sun was touching the hori- 
zon as he reached the ridge and 
looked down into the valley. 

A broad river flowed across the 
valley floor. The track scars reach- 
ed the southern bank and con- 
tinued on the other side. As far as 
he could see they ran across the 
valley until lost to sight in some 
woodland. There was no sign of the 
city. 

Angry and confused, Helward 
stared at the valley until darkness 
fell, then made his camp for the 
night. 

He started out soon after day- 
break and within a few minutes was 
by the bank of the river. On this 
side there were many signs of 
human activity — the ground at the 
water’s edge had been churned into 
a muddy waste and a great deal of 
discarded timber and broken 



INVERTED WORLD 



143 



sleeper-foundations lay about. In 
the water itself were several timber 
piles, presumably all that now re- 
mained of the bridge the city had 
had to build. 

Helward waded down into the 
water, holding on to the nearest 
pile for support. As the water deep- 
ened he started to swim, but the 
current took him and he was swept 
a long way downstream before he 
could haul himself onto the north- 
ern bank. 

Soaked through, he walked back 
upstream until he reached the track 
remains. His pack and clothes 
weighed heavily on him, so he 
undressed and laid his clothes in 
the sun, then spread the sleeping 
bag and canvas pack. An hour later 
his clothes were dry, so he pulled 
them on again and prepared to 
move off. The sleeping bag was still 
not completely dry, but he planned 
to air it at his next stop. 

He was strapping his pack into 
place when he heard a rattling 
noise and something plucked at his 
shoulder. Helward turned in time 
to see a crossbow quarrel fall on the 
ground. 

He dove for cover into one of the 
sleeper foundations. 

“Stay right there.” 

H e looked in the direction of 
the voice. He couldn’t see the 
speaker, but there was a clump of 
bushes some fifty yards away. 

Helward examined his shoulder. 
The quarrel had torn away a sec- 
tion of his sleeve, but it had not 
drawn blood. He was defenseless, 
having lost his crossbow with the re- 
mainder of his possessions. 



“I’m coming out — don’t move.” 
A moment later a man wearing 
the guild-apprentice uniform 
stepped out from behind the bush, 
his crossbow leveled at Helward. 

Helward shouted: “Don’t shoot — 
I'm from the city.” 

The man said nothing, but con- 
tinued to advance. He halted about 
five yards away. 

“All right — stand up.” 

Helward did so, seeking the 
recognition he anticipated. 

“Who are you?” 

“I’m from the city,” Helward re- 
peated. 

“Which guild?” 

“The Futures.” 

“What’s the last line of the 
oath?” 

Helward shook his head in sur- 
prise. “Listen, what the — ” 

“Come on — the oath.” 

‘“All this is sworn in the full 
knowledge that a betrayal of any 
one — 

The man lowered his bow. 
“Okay,” he said. “I had to be 
sure. What’s your name?” 
“Helward Mann.” 

The other looked at him closely. 
“God, I never recognized you! 
You’ve grown a beard — ” 

“Jase!” 

The two young men stared at 
each other for a few seconds more, 
then greeted each other affably. 
Helward realized that they both 
must have changed out of recogni- 
tion in the time since they had last 
met. Then they had both been 
beardless boys, agonizing about the 
frustrations of life inside the 
creche — now they had changed in 
outlook as well as appearance. In 



144 



GALAXY 



the creche, Gelman Jase had af- 
fected a worldliness and disdain for 
the order by which they had to exist 
and he had mannered himself as a 
careless and irresponsible leader of 
the boys who “matured” less 
quickly. None of this was apparent 
to Helward as they stood there 
beside the river, renewing their 
earlier friendship. His experiences 
outside the city had weathered Jase 
subjectively, just as they had 
weathered his appearance. 

“What was all that about, shoot- 
ing at me?” Helward asked. 

“I thought you were a took.” 

“A what? Oh yes.” He had for- 
gotten the slang word. “But didn’t 
you see my uniform?” 

“Doesn’t mean anything any 
more.” 

“But—” 

“Listen, Helward, things are 
changing. How many apprentices 
have you seen down past?” 

“Two. Three, including you.” 
“Right. Did you know the city 
sends an apprentice down past 
every mile or so? There should be 
many more down here — and since 
we all take the same route we ought 
to be meeting each other almost 
every day. But the tooks are catch- 
ing on. They’re killing the appren- 
tices and taking their uniforms. 
Were you attacked?” 

“No,” said Helward. 

“I was.” 

“You could have tried to identify 
me before you shot at me.” 

“I aimed to miss you.” 

Helward indicated his torn 
sleeve. “Then you’re just a lousy 
shot.” 

Jase moved over to where his 



quarrel had fallen. He picked it up, 
examined it for damage, then 
replaced it in its pouch. 

“We ought to be trying to reach 
the city,” he said when he returned! 
“Do you know where it is?” 

Jase looked worried. 

“I can’t work it out,” he said, 
“I've been walking for miles. Has 
the city suddenly accelerated?” 
“Not as far as I know. I saw 
another apprentice yesterday. He 
said the city had actually been de- 
layed.” 

“Then where the hell is it?” 
“Somewhere up there.” Helward 
indicated the track remains leading 
north. 

“Then we go on.” 

B y the end of the > day they still 
had not sighted the city, though 
the tracks were now apparently the 
normal dimensions. They made a 
camp in a patch of woodland 
through which a stream of clean 
water flowed. 

Jase was far better equipped than 
Helward. In addition to his cross- 
bow, he had a spare sleeping bag 
(Helward ’s wet one had started to 
smell and he threw it away), a tent 
and plenty of food. 

“What do you make of down 
past?” Jase asked. 

“I’m still trying to understand 
it,” said Helward. “What about 
you?” 

“I don’t know. The same, I sup- 
pose. I can’t make logic of what 
I’ve seen — and yet I know I’ve seen 
and experienced it.” 

“How can ground possibly 
move?” 

“You noticed it too?” 



INVERTED WORLD 



145 



“I think so. That’s what happen- 
ed, wasn’t it?” 

Later, they traded accounts of 
what had happened to them. Some 
of Jase’s experiences had been re- 
markably different from Helward’s. 

He had left the creche a few miles 
before Helward and had undergone 
many of the same experiences 
working outside the city. An essen- 
tial difference, though, was that he 
had not married, and had been in- 
vited to meet some of the trans- 
ferred women. As a result of this he 
had already known the two women 
he had been assigned to escort 
down past. 

He had learned many of the 
stories told by the local inhabitants 
about the people of the city. How 
the city was populated by giants, 
how they plundered and killed and 
raped the women. 

As his journey south had pro- 
ceeded Jase had realized that the 
girls had been growing more fright- 
ened. When he had asked them 
why, they had said that they felt 
certain they would be killed by their 
own kind when they returned. They 
had wanted to go back to the city. 
At this point Jase had been noticing 
the first effects of the lateral distor- 
tions. He had turned the girls back 
and told them to make their own 
way back to the city, intending to 
spend one more day on his own 
down past in order to study the 
phenomenon. 

He had traveled south, but had 
seen little that interested him. Then 
he had attempted to find the girls. 
He had discovered them three days 
later. Their throats had been cut. 
Still recoiling from the shock, Jase 



himself had been attacked by a 
crowd of local men, some of whom 
were wearing apprentices’ uni- 
forms. He had managed to escape, 
but the men had given chase. Three 
days of nightmare had followed. 
While making his escape he had 
fallen and badly twisted his foot 
and in his lamed state had been 
able to do little more than hide. 
During the chase, he had gone a 
long way from the tracks and had 
moved south by several miles. The 
hunt had been called off. Jase had 
stayed in hiding — but gradually 
had felt a slow build-up of south- 
ward pressure. He had realized that 
he was in a region he could not 
recognize. He described to Helward 
the fiat, featureless terrain, the tre- 
mendous pressure, the way in 
which physical distortions took 
place. 

He had tried to move back in the 
direction of the tracks, but his 
weakened leg had made progress 
difficult. Finally be had been 
forced to anchor himself to the 
ground with the grapple and rope 
until he could walk again. The 
build-up of pressure had continued 
and, fearing the rope would hold no 
longer, he had been forced to crawl 
northward. After a long and diffi- 
cult period he had managed to es- 
cape from the zone of worst pres- 
sure and had headed back toward 
the city. 

He had wandered for a long time 
without finding the tracks. As a 
consequence his knowledge of the 
terrain away from the immediate 
neighborhood of the tracks was 
considerably greater than Hel- 
ward’s. 



146 



GALAXY 



££T'vid you know there’s another 
P / city over there?” Jase asked, 
indicating the land to the west of 
the tracks. 

“Another city?” Helward was in- 
credulous. 

“Nothing like Earth. This one is 
built on the ground.” 

“But how — ” 

“It’s immense. Ten times, twenty 
times as big as Earth. I didn’t 
recognize it for what it was at 
first— 1 thought it was just another 
settlement, but one much larger 
than what we’ve seen before. Hel- 
ward, listen, it’s a city like the cities 
we learned about in the creche — the 
ones on Earth planet. Hundreds, 
thousands of buildings — all built 
on the ground.” 

“Are there any people there?” 
“A few — not many. There was a 
lot of damage. I don’t know what 
happened there, but most of it 
seemed to be abandoned now. I 
didn’t stay long because I didn’t 
want to be seen. But it’s a beautiful 
sight— all those buildings.” 

“Can we go there?” 

‘‘No. Keep away. Too many 
tooks. There's something going on 
out there — the situation is chang- 
ing. They’re organizing themselves 
better and have improved lines of 
communication. In the past, when 
the city went to a village we were 
often the first people from outside 
whom the inhabitants had seen for 
a long time. But from things the 
girls said to me I got the impression 
that that's not likely to be the case 
any more. Word is spreading about 
the city — and the tooks don’t like 
us. They never have, but in small 
groups they were weak. Now I think 



they want to destroy the city.” 
“And so they dress as appren- 
tices,” said Helward, still not 
grasping the seriousness of Jase’s 
tone. 

“That’s a small part of it. They 
take the clothes of the apprentices 
they kill to make further killings 
easier. But if they decide to attack 
the city it’ll be when they’re well or- 
ganized and determined." 

“I can't believe that they could 
ever threaten us.” 

“Maybe not. But you were 
lucky.” 



tn the morning they set out early 
I and traveled hard. They walked 
all day, not stopping for more than 
a few minutes at a time. By their 
side, the scars left by the tracks had 
returned to normal dimensions and 
both were spurred on by the 
thought that the city could not be 
more than a few hours’ walk ahead. 

As the afternoon drew on the 
track led in a winding route around 
the side of a hill, and as they 
reached the crest of the climb they 
saw the city ahead of them, sta- 
tionary in a broad valley. 

. They stopped, stared. 

The city had changed. 

Something about it made Hel- 
ward run forward. He could see 
signs of normal activity about the 
city. Four track crews were tearing 
up the rails behind it. Ahead of it a 
larger team was sinking piles into 
the river that presently barred the 
city’s way. But the shape of the city 
had changed. The rear section was 
misshapen and blackened. 

The lines of militia had been 



INVERTED WORLD 



147 



strengthened. Jase and Helward 
were halted and their identities 
checked. Both men fumed at the 
delay, for it was clear that a major 
disaster had struck here. While 
waiting for clearance from inside 
the city, Jase learned from the mi- 
litiaman in charge that there had 
been two attacks by the tooks. The 
second one had been more serious 
than the first. At least twenty-three 
militiamen had been killed — they 
were still counting bodies. 

When the clearance came 
through, Helward and Jase walked 
on in silence. 

The creche had been razed — 
mostly it was the children who had 
died. 



M ore had changed. The im- 
pact of these changes was se- 
vere, but Helward had no time to 
register any reaction. He could only 
mark them, then try to push them 
aside until external pressures eased. 
He had no time. to dwell on his 
thoughts. 

He learned that his father had 
died. The angina had stopped his 
heart only a few hours ater Helward 
had left the city. Clausewitz broke 
the news to him — and Clausewitz 
also told Helward that his appren- 
ticeship was now over. 

More: Victoria had given birth to 
a baby — a boy — but it had been 
one of those that had died in the 
last attack. 

More: Victoria had signed a 
form that pronounced the marriage 
over. She was living with another 
man and w r as pregnant again. 

And more, implicitly tied up with 



all of these events, yet no more con- 
ceivable: Helward learned from the 
central calendar that while he had 
been away the city had moved a 
total of seventy-three miles and was 
even so eight miles behind opti- 
mum. In his own subjective time 
scale, Helward had been gone for 
less than three miles. 

He accepted all these as facts. 
The reaction of shock could come 
later — meanwhile another attack 
was imminent.

T he valley was dark and silent. 

Across on the northern side of 
the river I saw a red light flash on 
twice, then nothing. 

Seconds later I heard from deep 
within the city the grinding of the 
winch drums and the city began to 
inch forward. The sound echoed 
around the valley. 

I was lying with about thirty 
other men in the tangled under- 
growth that spread across the face 
of the hill. I had been drafted tem- 
porarily to work with the militia 
during this most critical of all the 
city’s crossings. The third attack 
was anticipated at any moment. It 
had been judged that once the city 
could reach the northern bank of 
the river it would, by nature of the 
surrounding terrain, be able to de- 
fend itself sufficiently long for the 
tracks to be extended at least as far 
as the highest point of the pass 
through the hills to the north. Once 
there, it. was thought that it could 



148 



GALAXY 



again defend itself for the next 
phase of track-laying. 

Somewhere in the valley, we 
knew, were about a hundred and 
fifty tooks, all armed with rifles. 
They presented a formidable 
enemy. The city had only twelve 
rifles taken from the tooks and the 
ammunition for them had been 
spent during the second attack. 
Our only realistic weapons were the 
crosbows — at short range, deadly — 
and an awareness of the value of in- 
telligence work. This latter had en- 
abled us to prepare the counter- 
attack of which I was a part. 

A few hours earlier, as darkness 
fell, we had taken up this position 
overlooking the valley. The main 
force of defense was made up of 
three ranks of crossbowmen de- 
ployed around the city itself. They 
would retreat as the city started out 
across the bridge until they formed 
a defensive position around the 
tracks. The tooks would concen- 
trate their fire on these men and at 
that moment we could spring our 
ambush. 

With fortune on our side, the 
counterattack would not be neces- 
sary. The bridge-building work had 
been completed faster than antici- 
pated and it was hoped that the city 
would be safely across to the other 
side under cover of darkness before 
the tooks realized. 

But in the still of the valley the 
sound of the winches was unmis- 
takable. 

The forward edge of the city had 
just reached the bridge itself when 
the first shots were heard. I placed 
a bolt in the bow and held my hand 
over the safety catch. 



It was a cloudy night and visi- 
bility was poor. I had seen the 
flashes from the rifles and esti- 
mated that the tooks were ranged 
in a rough semicircle, approximate- 
ly one hundred yards from our 
men. I could not tell if any of their 
bullets had hit, but so far there 
were no answering shots. 

More rifles fired and we could 
tell the tooks were closing in. The 
city had half its bulk on the 
bridge — and still crept forward. 

From down below came a distant 
shout: “Lights!” 

Instantly a battery of eight arc- 
lamps situated on the rear of the 
city came on, directed over the 
heads of the crossbowmen and into 
the surrounding terrain. The tooks 
were there, not taking any kind of 
cover. 

The first rank of crossbowmen 
loosed their bolts, hunched down 
and started to reload. The second 
rank shot, hunched down and 
reloaded. The third rank shot, 
reloaded. 

Taken by surprise the tooks had 
suffered several casualties, but now 
they threw themselves down against 
the ground and fired at all they 
could see of the defenders: the 
black silhouettes against the arc- 
lamps. 

“Lights off!” 

Darkness fell at once and the 
crossbowmen by the city dispersed. 
A few seconds later the lights came 
on again and the crossbowmen 
fired from their new positions. 

Once again the tooks were taken 
off aim and more casualties were 
inflicted. The lights went off again 
and in the sudden darkness the 



INVERTED WORLD 



149 



crossbowmen returned to their 
former position. The maneuver was 
repeated . 

at a shout from below the arc- 
lamps came on again and we 
saw that the tooks were charging. 
The city was now on the bridge. 

Suddenly there was a loud explo- 
sion and a gush of flame licked the 
side of the city. An instant later a 
second explosion occurred on the 
bridge itself and flames spread 
across the dry timber of the trestle. 

“Reserve force, ready!” 

I stood up and waited for the 
order. I was no longer frightened 
and the tension of the waiting hours 
had disappeared. 

“Advance!” 

The arc-lamps were still burning 
and we could see the tooks clearly. 
Most of them were engaged in a 
hand-to-hand battle with the main 
defense, but several more were 
crouched on the ground, taking 
careful aim at the superstructure of 
the city. Two of the arc- lamps were 
hit and went out. 

The flames on the bridge and 
against the side of the city were 
spreading. 

I saw a took near the bank of the 
river, swinging his arm back in 
preparation to throw a metal cylin- 
der. I was no more than tiventy 
yards from him. I aimed, released 
the bolt — and hit the man in his 
chest. The incendiary bomb fell a 
few yards away from him and ex- 
ploded in a burst of heat and flame. 

Our counterattack had, as antici- 
pated, taken the enemy by surprise. 
We managed to hit three more of 
the men — but suddenly they broke 



off and ran toward east, disappear- 
ing into the shadows of the valley. 

There was considerable confu- 
sion for a minute or two. The city 
was on fire and beneath it the 
bridge was burning fiercely in two 
separate places. One concentration 
of flame was directly beneath the 
city, but the other was a few yards 
behind it. It was obviously urgent 
to deal with the fires, but no one 
was certain that all the tooks had 
retreated. 

The city continued to winch for- 
ward, but where the bridge burned 
large sections of timber were falling 
into the river. 

Order was restored quickly. A 
militia officer shouted commands 
and the men formed into two 
groups. One group resumed defen- 
sive position around the tracks. I 
joined the second group sent out to 
the bridge to fight the fire. 

After the second attack — in 
which incendiaries had been used 
for the first time — firepoints had 
been fitted to the outside of the 
city. The nearest of these had been 
damaged in one of the explosions, 
and water was gushing away from it 
uselessly. We found a second one 
and unraveled the short length of 
hose. 

The intensity of the track fire was 
too great and it was almost hopeless 
to try to fight it. Although the city 
had now passed over the worst of 
the damage three of the main 
runner wheels were still to roll over 
the burning timber — and as we 
fought in the dense smoke and 
billowing flames I saw the rail be- 
ginning to twist under the com- 
bined forces of heat and weight. 



150 



GALAXY 



There was a roar and another 
section of timber fell away. The 
smoke was too thick. Choking, we 
had to back out from under the 
city. 

The fire in the superstructure 
was still blazing, but a fire crew 
inside the city was attempting to 
deal with it. The winches turned — 
the city crept slowly toward the 
comparative safety of the northern 
bank. 

XXII 

I n the morning light the damage 
was assessed. In terms of lost 
human life the city had not fared 
too badly. Three militiamen had 
been killed in the shooting and 
fifteen had been injured. Inside the 
city one-man had been seriously 
wounded in one of the incendiary 
explosions and a dozen more men 
and women had been overcome by 
smoke in the ensuing fires. 

The physical damage to the city 
itself was extensive. A whole section 
of administrative offices had been 
gutted by the fire and some of the 
accommodation section was unin- 
habitable because of fire or water 
damage. 

Beneath the city more was 
wrong. Although the main base of 
the city was steel, much of the 
construction was timber and there 
were whole sections which had been 
burned out. The rear runner wheels 
on the right outer track had been 
derailed and one of the great wheels 
had sustained a structural crack. It 
would have to be discarded — 
though it could not be replaced. 
After the city had reached the 



northern bank the bridge had con- 
tinued to burn and was now a total 
loss. With it had gone several hun- 
dred yards of our irreplaceable 
rails, warped and twisted by the 
heat. 



after two days outside the city, 
/^working with the track crews 
who were salvaging what there was 
of the rails on the southern bank of 
the river, I was summoned to see 
Clausewitz. 

Until now I had not reported for- 
mally to any of my senior guilds- 
men. As far as I could determine 
the normal protocols of the guilds 
had been abandoned for the dura- 
tion of the emergency and as I my- 
self could see no end to the serious 
situation — the attacks had caused 
inevitable delays and the optimum 
was ever farther away — I had not 
expected anyone to call me away 
from my work outside. 

There was a disturbing mood 
among these men outside. Halfway 
between despair and desperation, 
they continued the work of laying 
the tracks toward the pass. The re- 
laxed energy of my early days out- 
side the city seemed to be a long 
way behind us. Now the tracks were 
being built in spite of the situation 
with the tooks, rather than against 
an internal need of the city to sur- 
vive in a strange environment. 

The talk among the track crews, 
the militia, the traction men was all 
centered in one way or another 
around the attacks. No longer was 
there mention of gaining ground on 
the optimum or of what dangers lay 
down past. That the city was in a 



INVERTED WORLD 



151 



crisis was reflected in everyone’s at- 
titude. 

The change was also apparent in- 
side the city. 

Gone was the light, aseptic ap- 
pearance of the corridors, gone the 
general atmosphere of workaday 
routines. 

The elevator was no longer work- 
ing. Many of the main doors in the 
corridors were locked and at one 
point an entire wall had been torn 
away — presumably as an aftermath 
of one of the fires — so that anyone 
walking through that part of the 
city could see what was outside. I 
remembered Victoria’s frustrations 
of old and reflected that whatever 
secrecy the guilds might have tried 
to maintain in the past, such sec- 
recy was no longer possible. 

T hought of Victoria pained 
me — I still did not realize fully 
what had happened. In what 
seemed to me to be the passage of a 
few days she had abandoned all the 
tacit understandings of the mar- 
riage between us and gone to pur- 
sue another life without me. 

I had not seen her since my re- 
turn, though 1 had made sure that 
she knew I was back in the city. 
Under the conditions of the exter- 
nal threat it had not been possible 
to see her anyway, but that aspect 
of my life was one I needed time to 
consider before meeting her. The 
news of her pregnancy by another 
man — I was told he was an Educa- 
tion administrator named Yung — 
had not hit me too hard at first, 
simply because I had just not be- 
lieved it. Such a situation could not 
possibly have developed in the time 



I knew I had been away from her. 

I found my way to the first-order 
guild area with some difficulty. The 
interior of the city had changed in 
many ways. 

People, noise and dirt seemed to 
be everywhere. Every spare yard of 
space had been given over to emer- 
gency sleeping room, and even in 
some of the corridors lay wounded 
men from outside. Several walls 
and partitions had been taken 
down and just outside the first- 
order quarters — where there had 
been a series of pleasantly appoint- 
ed recreation rooms for the guilds- 
men — an emergency kitchen had 
been placed. 

The smell of burned wood was 
everywhere. 

I knew a fundamental change 
was coming over the city. I could 
feel the old structure of the guilds 
crumbling away. The roles of many 
people had already changed. 
Working with the track crews I had 
met several men for whom it was 
the first time outside the city, men 
who — until the attacks — had 
worked on food synthesis, educa- 
tion or domestic administration. 
Took labor was now obviously im- 
possible and all hands had to be 
called to move the city. Why at this 
moment Clausewitz had summoned 
me I could not imagine. 

There was no sign of him in the 
Futures’ room, so I waited for a 
while. After half an hour he had 
still not appeared and knowing my 
services could be better employed 
outside, I headed back the way I 
had come. 

I met Future Denton in the cor- 
ridor. 



152 



GALAXY 



“You’re Future Mann?” 

“Yes.” 

"We’re leaving the city. Are you 
ready now?” 

“I was supposed to be seeing 
Future Clausewitz.” 

“That’s right. He’s sent me in- 
stead. Can you ride a horse?” 

I had forgotten horses while I 
had been away from the city. 
“Yes.” 

“Good. Meet me at the stables in 
an hour’s time.” 

He walked on into the Futures’ 
room. 

With an hour to spend on my 
own, I realized that I had nothing 
to do, no one to see. All my connec- 
tions with the city were broken- 
even associative memories of the 
physical shape and appearance of 
the city had been disrupted. 

I walked down to the rear of the 
city to see for myself the extent of 
the damage to the creche, but there 
was not much to see. Almost the 
whole superstructure had been 
burned or demolished and where 
the children had been housed was 
merely the bare steel of the main 
base of the city. From there I could 
see back across the river to where 
the attack had taken place. I 
wondered whether the tooks would 
try again. I felt they had been w r ell 
beaten, but I supposed they might 
eventually reform and attack once 
more. 

It came home to me just how 
vulnerable the city was. Not de- 
signed to repel any kind of attack, 
it was slow-moving, ungainly, built 
of highly inflammable materials. 
All its weakest points, the tracks, 
the cables, the timber superstruc- 



ture, were easily accessible. 

I wondered if the tooks realized 
how easy it would be to destroy the 
city — all they needed to do was dis- 
able its motive powers perma- 
nently, then sit back and watch as 
the movement of the ground slowly 
bore it south. 

For the moment, though, the city 
was relatively secure. Bounded on 
one side by the river and by rising 
ground which would afford no 
cover to any aggressor on the other, 
it was strategically placed. 

I wondered whether I had time to 
find a change of clothes — I had 
been working and sleeping in the 
same ones for many days. This 
thought inevitably reminded me of 
Victoria and how she had objected 
to my uniform after I had been out- 
side the city. 

I returned to the Futures’ room, 
and made inquiries. Uniforms were 
normally available, I was told, but 
not at the moment. I was told that 
one would be found while I was 
away. 

Future Denton was waiting for 
me when I arrived at the stables. I 
was given a horse and without 
further delay we rode out from be- 
neath the city and headed north. 

XXIII 

D enton was not a man who 
said much unprompted. He 
answered any questions 1 chose to 
ask, but between us fell long 
periods of silence. I did not find 
these uncomfortable — they gave me 
much needed opportunities to 
think. 

The early training of the guilds 



INVERTED WORLD 



153 



still ran true: I accepted that I 
would make what I could of what I 
saw and not rely on the interpreta- 
tions of others. 

We followed the proposed line of 
the tracks around the side of the 
hill and through the pass. There 
the ground ran steadily down for a 
long way, following a small water- 
course. There was a small patch of 
woodland at the end of the valley, 
and then another line of hills. 

“Denton, why have we left the 
city at this moment?” I said. 
“Surely every man is needed.” 

“Our work is always important.” 

“More important than defending 
the city?” 

“Yes." 

As we rode he explained that 
during the last few miles the future 
surveying had been neglected. This 
was partly because of the troubles 
and partly because the guild was 
undermanned. 

“We’ve mapped as far as these 
hills,” he said. “Those trees — 
they’re a nuisance to the Track 
guild and they could provide cover 
for the tooks, but we need more 
timber. The hills have been survey- 
ed for about another mile, but 
beyond that it’s all virgin terri- 
tory.” 

He showed me a chart that had 
been drawn on a long roll of paper 
and explained the symbols to me. 
Our job, as far as I could tell, was 
to extend the map northward. 
Denton had a surveying instrument 
mounted on a large wooden tripod 
and every so often he would take a 
reading from it and make inscrip- 
tions on the map. 

The horses were heavily laden 



with equipment. In addition to 
large supplies of food and bedding 
we were each carrying a crossbow 
and bolts — there were some digging 
tools, a chemical-sampling kit, a 
miniature video camera and record- 
ing equipment. I was given the 
video kit to use and Denton showed 
me how to operate it. 

The usual method of the Futures, 
as he explained it to me, was to 
send — over a period of time — a dif- 
ferent surveyor or a different team 
of surveyors north of the city by 
different routes. By the end of the 
expedition each would have a de- 
tailed map of the terrain and a 
video record of its physical appear- 
ance. This would then be submitted 
to the council of Navigators and 
they, with the help of other sur- 
veyors’ reports, would decide which 
route would be taken. 

Toward late afternoon Denton 
stopped for about the sixth time 
and erected his tripod . After he had 
taken angular readings on the ele- 
vation of the surrounding hills and, 
by use of a gyroscopically mounted 
compass, had determined true 
north, he attached a free-swinging 
pendulum to the base of the instru- 
ment. The weight of the pendulum 
was pointed and when its natural 
momentum was spent and the 
pointer was stationary, Denton 
took a graduated scale marked with 
concentric circles and placed it be- 
tween the legs of the tripod. 

The pointer was almost exactly 
above the central mark. 

“We’re at optimum,” he said. 
“Know what that means?” 

“Not exactly.” 

“You've been down past, haven’t 



154 



GALAXY 



you?” I confirmed this. “There’s 
always centrifugal force to contend 
with on this world. The farther 
south one travels, the greater that 
force is. It’s always present any- 
where south of optimum, but it 
makes no practicable difference to 
normal operations for about twelve 
miles south of optimum. Farther 
than that the city would have real 
problems.” 

He took further readings from 
his instrument. 

“Eight and a half miles,” he 
said. “That’s the distance between 
here and the city — or how much 
ground the city has to make up." 

I asked, “How is the optimum 
measured?” 

“By its null gravitational distor- 
tions. It serves as the standard by 
which we measure the city’s prog- 
ress. In physical terms, imagine it 
as a line drawn around the world.” 

“And the optimum is always 
moving?” 

“No. The optimum is station- 
ary — but the ground moves away 
from it.” 

“Oh, yes.” 

We packed our gear and con- 
tinued north. Just before sunset we 
made camp for the night. 

XXIV 

T he surveying work was mentally 
undemanding and as we travel- 
ed slowly northward I found that 
my only external preoccupation was 
the need to watch for signs of hos- 
tile inhabitants. Denton told me 
that an attack on us was unlikely — 
nevertheless we were on guard. 

I found myself again thinking 



about the awesome experience of 
seeing the whole world lying before 
me. As an event, it was enough — 
understanding it was something 
else. 

On our third day out from the 
city I suddenly started to consider 
the education I had been given as a 
child. I’m not sure what started the 
train of thought — possibly a ran- 
dom recollection of my recent 
shock at seeing how utterly the 
creche had been destroyed. 

I had thought little of my educa- 
tion since leaving the creche. At the 
time I had felt, in common with 
most of the children in the creche, 
that the teaching we were given was 
not much more than a penance in 
which time was served out of neces- 
sity. But as I looked back, much of 
the education pushed into our un- 
willing heads took on a new dimen- 
sion for me. 

For instance, one of the subjects 
that had inspired in us the most 
boredom was what the teachers re- 
ferred to as Geography. Most of 
these lessons had been concerned 
with the techniques of cartography 
and surveying — in the enclosed en- 
vironment of the creche, such exer- 
cises had been almost wholly theo- 
retical. Now, though, those hours 
of tedium took on their relevance at 
long last. With a little concentra- 
tion and a certain amount of 
digging into my memory, I grasped 
quickly the principles of the work 
Denton was showing me. 

We had had many other subjects 
taught to us theoretically and I saw 
now how those, too, had practical 
relevance. Any new guild appren- 
tice would already have a back- 



INVERTED WORLD 



155 



ground knowledge of the work his 
own guild would expect him to do 
and, in additon, would have similar 
information about many of the 
other functions of the city. 

Nothing could have prepared me 
for the sheer physical grind of 
working on the tracks, but I had 
had an almost instinctive under- 
standing of the actual machinery 
used to haul the city along those 
tracks. 

1 had cared not at all for the 
compulsory training with the mi- 
litia, but the puzzling — at the 
time — emphasis placed on military 
strategy during our education 
would clearly help men who later 
took arms for the security of the 
city. 

This process of thought led me 
toward wondering whether there 
had been anything in my education 
that could possibly have prepared 
me for the sight of a world shaped 
the way this one appeared to be. 

The lessons we had been given 
which specifically referred to astro- 
physics and astronomy had always 
spoken of planets as spheres. 
Earth — the planet, not our city — 
was described as an oblate spheroid 
and we had been shown maps of 
some of its land surface area. This 
aspect of physical science was not 
dwelled upon — I had grown up to 
assume that the world on which 
Earth city existed was a sphere like 
Earth planet and nothing I had 
been taught had contradicted this 
assumption. Indeed, the nature of 
the world had never been discussed 
overtly. 

I knew that Earth planet was 
part of a system of planets orbiting 



a spherical sun. The planet itself 
was circled by a spherical satellite. 
This information seemed always to 
be theoretical — and this lack of 
practical application had not con- 
cerned me even when I left the city, 
for it was always clear that here a 
different circumstance obtained. 
The sun and moon were not 
spherical and neither was the world 
on which we lived. 

The question remained — where 
were we? 

The solution lay perhaps in the 
past. 

T his, too, had been covered 
comprehensively, although the 
histories we were taught were exclu- 
sively about Earth planet. Much of 
what we learned concerned military 
maneuvers, the transference of 
power and government from one 
state to another. We knew that 
time was measured in terms of 
years and centuries on Earth 
planet, that recorded history exist- 
ed for about twenty centuries. Per- 
haps unfairly, I formed an impres- 
sion that I should not care to live on 
Earth planet, as most of its exis- 
tence seemed to be a series of 
disputes, wars, territorial claims, 
economic pressures. The concept of 
civilization was far advanced and 
explained to us as the state in which 
mankind congregated within cities. 
By definition, we of Earth city were 
civilized, but there seemed to be no 
resemblance between our existence 
and theirs. Civilization on Earth 
planet was equated with selfishness 
and greed — those people who lived 
in a civilized state exploited those 
who did not. There were shortages 



156 



GALAXY 



of vital commodities on Earth 
planet and the people in the 
civilized nations were able to mo- 
nopolize those commodities by rea- 
son of their greater economic 
strength. This imbalance appeared 
to be at the root of the disputes. 

I suddenly saw parallels between 
our civilization and theirs. The city 
was undoubtedly on a war footing 
as a result of the situation with the 
tooks — and that in its turn was a 
product of our barter system. We 
did not exploit them through 
wealth, but we had a surplus of the 
commodities in short supply among 
them — food, fuel energy, raw ma- 
terials. Our shortage was man- 
power and we paid for that with our 
surplus commodities. 

The process was inverted, but the 
product was the same. 

Following my line of reasoning, I 
saw that the examination of the 
history of Earth planet prepared 
the way for those who would 
become Barter guildsmen, but it 
took me no further along my own 
search for understanding. The 
histories began and ended on Earth 
planet, with no mention of how the 
city came to be on this world, nor 
how the city had been built, nor 
about who its founders were and 
where they came from. 

A deliberate omission? Or for- 
gotten knowledge? 

I imagined that many guildsmen 
had tried to construct their own 
patterns of logic and, for all I 
knew, either the answers were 
available somewhere in the city or 
there was a commonly accepted 
hypothesis which I had not yet en- 
countered. But I had fallen natu- 



rally into the ways of the guilds- 
men. Survival on this world was a 
matter of initiative: on the grand 
scale, by hauling the city northward 
away from that zone of amazing 
distortion behind us, and on the 
personal scale of deriving for one- 
self a pattern of life that was self- 
determined. Future Denton was a 
self-sufficient man and so had been 
most of those I had met. I wanted 
to be one with them and compre- 
hend things on my own account. I 
supposed that I could discuss my 
thoughts with Denton, but I chose 
not to. 

T he journey northward was slow 
and meandering. We did not 
take a route due north, but follow- 
ed many diversions to east and 
west. Periodically Denton would 
measure our position against opti- 
mum and never at any time were we 
farther north than about fifteen 
miles. 

I asked him if there were any rea- 
son why we should not strike even 
farther north of optimum. 

“Normally we would go as far 
north as we could,” he said. “But 
the city’s in a special circumstance. 
As well as seeking the easiest route, 
we need terrain that will allow us to 
defend ourselves.” 

The map we were compiling was 
becoming more complete and de- 
tailed every day. Denton allowed 
me to operate the equipment when- 
ever I wished and soon I was as 
adept as he. I learned how to trian- 
gulate the land with the surveying 
instrument, how to estimate the 
elevation of hills and how to calcu- 
late our position relative to opti- 



INVERTED WORLD 



157 



mum. I was growing to like work- 
ing the camera, in spite of the fact 
that, to conserve the energy in the 
batteries, I was forced to curb my 
enthusiasm. 

It was peaceful and agreeable 
away from the tensions of the city 
and I discovered that Denton, in 
spite of his long silences, was an 
amiable and intelligent man. 

I had lost track of the number of 
days we had been away, but it was 
certainly at least twenty. Denton 
showed no sign of wanting to 
return. 

We encountered a small settle- 
ment nestling in a shallow valley. 
We made no attempt to approach 
it. Denton merely marked it on the 
map, with a rough estimate of its 
population. 

The countryside was greener and 
fresher than that to which I had 
grown accustomed, although the 
sun was no cooler. It rained more 
often here, usually during the 
nights, and there were many dif- 
ferent sizes of stream and river. 

- All the features of the region, 
natural or man-made, difficult for 
the city to pass through or suitable 
to its peculiar needs, Denton 
marked without comment on his 
map. It was not our job to decide 
which route the city should take — 
we worked simply to establish the 
actual nature of future terrain. 

The atmosphere was restful and 
soporific, the natural beauty of our 
surroundings seductive. I knew the 
city would travel through this 
region in the miles to come and 
pass it without registering apprecia- 
tion. For the city’s aesthetics, this 
verdant and gentle countryside 



might as well be a windswept de- 
sert. 

During the hours when 1 was not 
actually engaged in any of our rou- 
tine tasks, I was still lost in specula- 
tive thought. I could not get out of 
my mind that spectacle of the mani- 
fest appearance of the world on 
which we existed. There must have 
been something, somewhere in 
those long years of tedious educa- 
tion, that should — subconscious- 
ly — have prepared me for that 
sight. We live by our assumptions — 
if one took for granted that the 
world one traveled across was like 
any other, could any education ever 
prepare one for a total reversal of 
that assumption? 

The preparation for that sight 
had begun the day Future Denton 
had taken me outside the city for 
the first time, to see for myself a 
sun that revealed itself to be any 
shape but that of a sphere. 

But I still felt there must have 
been an earlier clue. 

I waited for a few' more days, still 
worrying at the problem when I 
found time. Then 1 had an idea. 
Denton and I had camped one 
evening in open country beside a 
broad, s'hallow river. As sunset ap- 
proached I took the video camera 
and recorder and walked alone up 
the side of a low hill about a half- 
mile away. From the top I had a 
clear view to the northeast. 

As the sun neared the horizon 
the atmospheric haze dimmed its 
glare and its shape became visible: 
as ever, a broad disk spiked top 
and bottom. I switched on the 
camera and took a long shot of it. 
Then I replayed the tape, checking 



158 



GALAXY 



that the picture was clear and 
steady. 

I had never tired of the spectacle. 
The sky was reddening — after the 
main disk had passed beneath the 
horizon the upright pinnacle of 
light slid quickly down. For a few 
minutes after its passing there was 
an impression of a bright focus of 
orange-white at the center of the 
red glow — but soon this passed and 
night came quickly on. 

I played the tape again, watching 
the image of the sun on the re- 
corder’s tiny monitor. I froze the 
picture, then adjusted the bright- 
ness control, dimming the image 
until only the white shape re- 
mained. 

There in miniature was an image 
of the world. My world. 1 had seen 
that shape before — long before 
leaving the confines of the creche. 
Those weird symmetrical curves 
made an overall pattern that some- 
one had once shown me. 

I stared at the monitor screen for 
a long time, then conscience struck 
me and I switched off to conserve 
the batteries. I did not return to 
camp immediately — I was straining 
my memory for some key to that 
faint recollection of the time when 
someone had drawn four lines on a 
sheet of card and held up for all to 
see the place where Earth city 
struggled to survive. 

T he map that Denton and I were 
compiling was taking on a 
definite shape. 

Drawn on the long roll of stiff 
paper he had brought, the plan 
took the form of a long, narrow 
funnel, its narrowest point at the 



patch of woodland a mile or so to 
the north of where the city had been 
when we left it. Our travels had all 
been within the funnel and had 
enabled us to make measurements 
of large features from all sides, to 
ensure that we compiled informa- 
tion as nearly accurate as possible. 

When the work was finished 
Denton said that we would return 
at once to the city. 

I had, in the video recorder, a 
complete and cross-referenced 
visual record of all the terrain we 
had covered. The Council of Navi- 
gators would examine as much as 
they felt necessary to plan the city’s 
next route. Denton told me that 
other Futures would go north soon, 
draw another tunnel-map of the 
terrain. Perhaps it, too, would start 
at the patch of w oodland and take a 
course five or ten degrees to east or 
west — or, if the Navigators felt that 
a safe route could be found in the 
terrain we had surveyed, the new 
map would start farther up the 
known territory and push forward 
again the frontier of the future we 
had surveyed. 

We headed back toward the city. 
I had expected, in some melodra- 
matic way, that now we had the in- 
formation we had been sent to 
obtain, we would ride through day 
and night w'ith no regard to safety 
or comfort — instead, the leisurely 
ride through the countryside con- 
tinued. 

“Shouldn’t we hurry?" I asked 
finally, thinking that perhaps Den- 
ton was idling for some reason con- 
nected with me. I wished to show 
that I was willing to move with 
speed. 



INVERTED WORLD 



159 



“There's never any hurry up 
future,” he said. 

I didn’t argue with him, but it 
had occurred to me that we had 
been away for at least thirty days. 
In that time the movement of the 
ground would have taken the city 
another three miles away from the 
optimum. It consequently would 
have had to travel at least that dis- 
tance to stay within safety limits. 

I knew that the unsurveyed terri- 
tory began only a mile or so beyond 
the city’s last position. 

In short, the city would need the 
information we had. 



T he return journey took three 
days. On the third day, as we 
loaded the horses and continued 
south, the memory I had been seek- 
ing came to me. It came unbidden, 
as is often the case when one is 
trying for something buried in the 
subconscious. 

I felt I had exhausted all my 
conscious memories of my creche 
schooling. Sorting through my 
recollections of the long academic 
courses had been as fruitless as the 
sessions had been tedious. Then, 
from a subject I had not even con- 
sidered, the answer came. 

I remembered a period in my last 
few miles inside the creche — our 
teacher had taken us into the 
realms of calculus. All aspects of 
mathematics had induced the same 
response in me — I showed neither 
interest nor success — and this fur- 
ther development of abstract con- 
cepts had seemed no different. 

The teaching had covered a kind 
of calculus known as functions and 



we were taught how to draw graphs 
representing these. It was the 
graphs that had provided the 
memory key. I had always had a 
moderate talent at drawing and for 
a few days my interest had flickered 
into life. It died almost immediate- 
ly, for I discovered that the graphs 
were not an end in themselves but 
were drawn to provide a means of 
finding out more about the func- 
tion — and I didn’t know what a 
function was. 

One graph in particular had 
been discussed in great and oner- 
ous detail. 

It showed the curve of an equa- 
tion where one value was represent- 
ed as a reciprocal — or an inverse — 
of the other. The graph for this was 
a hyperbola. One part of the graph 
was drawn in the positive quadrant, 
one in the negative. Each end of the 
curve had an infinite value, both 
positive and negative. 

The teacher had discussed what 
would happen if that graph were to 
be rotated about one of its axes, I 
had neither understood w’hy graphs 
should be drawn, nor that one 
might rotate them and I’d suffered 
another attack of daydreaming. 
But I did notice that the teacher 
had drawn on a piece of large card 
what the solid body would look like 
should this rotation be performed. 

The product was an impossible 
object: a solid with a disk of infinite 
radius and two hyperbolic spires 
above and below the disk, each of 
which narrowed toward an infi- 
nitely distant point. 

It was a mathematical abstrac- 
tion and held for me then as much 
interest as such an item should. 



160 



GALAXY 



But that mathematical impossi- 
bility was not taught to us without 
reason. In the indirect manner of 
all our education — on that day I 
had seen the shape of the world on 
which I lived. 

XXV 

D enton and I rode through the 
1 woodland at the bottom of the 
range of hills — and there ahead of 
us was the pass. 

Involuntarily I drew back on the 
reins and halted the horse. 

“The city,” 1 said. “Where is 
it?” 

“Still by the river, I should 
imagine.” 

“Then it must have been de- 
stroyed — ” 

There could be no other explana- 
tion. If the city had not moved in all 
those thirty days, only another at- 
tack could have delayed it. By now 
it should have been in its new posi- 
tion in the pass. 

Denton was watching me, an 
amused expression on his fase. 

“Is this the first time you've been 
so far north of optimum?” he 
asked. 

“Yes, it is.” 

“But you’ve been down past. 
What happened when you came 
back to the city?” 

“An attack was going on — ” 
“Yes — but how much time had 
elapsed?” 

“More than seventy miles.” 
“Was that more than you ex- 
pected?” 

“Yes. I thought I’d been gone 
only a few days — a mile or two in 
time.” 



“Okay.” Denton moved forward 
again and I followed. “The oppo- 
site is true if you go north of opti- 
mum.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Hasn’t anyone told you about 
the subjective time values?” My 
blank expression gave him the 
answer. “If you go anywhere south 
of optimum, subjective time is 
slowed. The farther south you go, 
the more that occurs. In the city the 
time scale is more or less normal 
while it is near the optimum, so 
that when you return from down 
past, it seems that the city has 
moved much farther than pos- 
sible.” 

“But we’ve been north.” 

“Yes, and the effect is opposite. 
While we ride north our subjective 
time scale is speeded, so that the 
city appears not to have moved at 
all. From experience, I think you’ll 
find that about four days have 
elapsed in the city while we’ve been 
gone. It’s difficult to estimate at the 
moment, as the city itself is farther 
south of optimum than normal.” 

I said nothing for a few minutes. 
I was trying to understand the idea. 

Then: “So if the city itself could 
move north of optimum, it wouldn’t 
have so many miles to travel. It 
could stop.” 

“No. It always has to move.” 

“But if where we’ve been slows 
down time, the city would benefit 
from being there.” 

“No,” he said again. “The dif- 
ferential in subjective time is rela- 
tive.” 

“I don’t understand,” I said 
honestly. 

We were now riding up the valley 



INVERTED WORLD 



161 



toward the pass. In a few minutes 
we would be able to see the city, if it 
was indeed where Denton had pre- 
dicted. 

“There are two factors. One is 
the movement of the ground. The 
other has to do with how one’s 
values of time are changed subjec- 
tively. Both are absolute, but not 
necessarily connected as far as we 
know.” 

“Then why—” 

“Listen. The ground moves phy- 
sically. In the north it moves 
slowly — and the farther north one 
travels the more slowly it moves — in 
the south it moves faster. If it were 
possible to reach the most northern 
point we believe the ground would 
not move at all. On the other hand, 
we believe that in the south the 
movement accelerates to an infinite 
speed at the farthest extremity of 
the world.” 

I said, “I’ve been there — to the 
farthest extremity.” 

“You went — what? Forty miles? 
Perhaps more by accident? That 
was far enough for you to feel the 
effects — but only the beginnings of 
the real thing. We’re talking in 
terms of millions of miles. Literally 
millions. Much more, some would 
say. Destaine thought the world 
was of infinite size.” 

“Destaine?” 

“The city’s founder.” 

I said, “But the city has only to 
travel a few miles farther, and it 
would be north of optimum.” 
“That’s right — and it would 
make life a lot easier. We would 
still have to move the city, but not 
so often and not so far. But the 
problem is that it's as much as we 



can do to stay abreast of opti- 
mum.” 

“What is special about the opti- 
mum?” 

“It’s where conditions on this 
world are nearest to those on Earth 
planet. At the optimum point our 
subjective values for time are 
normal. In addition, a day lasts for 
twenty-four hours. Anywhere else 
on this world one’s subjective time 
produces slightly longer or shorter 
days. The velocity of the ground at 
optimum is about one mile in every 
ten days. The optimum is impor- 
tant because on a world like this, 
where there are so many variables, 
we need a standard. Don't confuse 
miles-distance with miles-time. We 
say the city has moved so many 
miles when we really mean that ten 
times that number of twenty-four 
hour days have elapsed. So we 
would gain nothing in real terms by 
being north of optimum.” 

H e had now ridden to the highr 
est point of the pass. Cable 
stays had been erected and the city 
was in the process of being winched. 
The militiamen were much in evi- 
dence, standing guard not only 
around the city itself but also at 
both sides of the tracks. We de- 
cided not to ride down to the city, 
but to wait near the stays until the 
winching was completed. 

Denton asked suddenly, “Have 
you read Destaine’s Directive?” 
“No. I’ve heard of it. In the 
oath.” 

“That's right. Clausewitz has a 
copy. You ought to read it if you’re 
a guildsman. Destaine laid down 
the rules for survival on this world 



162 



GALAXY 



and no one’s ever seen any reason 
to change them. You’d understand 
the world a little better, I think.” 
“Did Destaine understand it?” 
“I think so.” 

It took another hour for the 
winching to be completed. There 
was no intervention by the tooks 
and, in fact, there was no sign of 
them. I saw that several of the mi- 
litiamen were now armed with 
rifles, presumably taken from the 
tooks killed in the last engagement. 

When we went into the city I 
went straight to the central calen- 
dar and discovered that while we 
had been north three and a half 
days had elapsed. 

T here was a brief discussion 
with Clausewitz. Then we were 
taken to see Navigator McMahon. 
Denton and I described in some 
detail the terrain w r e had traveled 
through, pointing out the major 
physical features on our map. 
Denton outlined our suggestions 
for a route that the city should 
take, indicating features that might 
create problems and alternative 
routes around them. In fact, the 
terrain was in general suited to the 
city. The hills would mean several 
deviations from true north, but 
there were few steep inclines and 
overall the ground was some hun- 
dred feet lower at its northern point 
than the city’s present elevation. 

“We’ll have two more surveys 
immediately,” McMahon said to 
Clausewitz. “One five degrees to 
east and one five degrees to west. 
Do you have men available?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“I’ll convene Council today and 



we’ll set your provisional route for 
the time being. If better terrain ap- 
pears from these two new surveys, 
we’ll reconsider later. How soon 
will you be able to conduct a nor- 
mal surveying pattern?” 

"As soon as we can release men 
from militia and tracks,” said 
Clausewitz. 

“They’re priorities. For the mo- 
ment these surveys will have to 
suffice. If the situation eases, re- 
apply.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

McMahon took our map and my 
video-tape and we left the Naviga- 
tion chambers. 

Outside, I said to Clausewitz: 
“Sir, I’d like to volunteer for one of 
the new surveys.” 

He shook his head. “No. You get 
three days’ leave and then you go 
back to the Track guild.” 

“But—” 

“Guild rules.” 

Clausewitz turned away and he 
and Denton walked toward the 
Futures' room. Technically that 
area was mine, too, but suddenly I 
felt excluded. Quite literally, I had 
nowhere to go. While I had been 
working outside the city I had been 
sleeping in one of the militia dormi- 
tories — now% officially on leave, I 
wasn’t even sure where I lived. 
There were bunks in the Futures’ 
room and I could sleep there for the 
moment, but I knew that I should 
see Victoria as soon as possible. I 
had been putting this off. I was still 
wondering how I could deal with 
the new situation with her and the 
answer to that lay in meeting her. I 
had a shower and changed my 
clothes. 



INVERTED WORLD

N othing much had changed in- 
side the city while I had been 
north. Domestic and Medical ad- 
ministrators were wholly preoccu- 
pied with looking after the wound- 
ed and reorganizing the city’s ac- 
commodations. There was less 
sense of desperation in the faces of 
the people I saw and some efforts 
had been made to keep the corri- 
dors clear, but even so I realized 
that this was probably a bad mo- 
ment to try to settle a domestic 
issue. 

Victoria was difficult to trace. 
After several inquiries I was sent to 
a makeshift dormitory on the low- 
est level, but she was not there. I 
spoke to the woman in charge. 

“You’re her ex-husband, aren’t 
you?” 

“That’s right. Where is she?” 
“She doesn’t want to see you. 
She’s very busy. She’ll contact you 
later,” 

“I want to see her,” I said. 

“You can’t. Now, if you’ll excuse 
me — we’re very busy.” 

She turned her back to me and 
continued with her work. I glanced 
around the crowded dormitory. 
Off-shift workers slept at one end 
and several wounded were lying in 
rough beds at the other. A few 
people were moving between the 
beds, but Victoria was not among 
them. 

I walked back to the Futures’ 
room. During the time I had been 
looking for Victoria I had made a 
decision. There was no point in my 
hanging around the city aimlessly — 
I might as well go back to work on 



the tracks. But first I decided to 
read Clausewitz’s copy of Destaine’s 
Directive. 

The Futures’ room was empty 
but for one guildsman. He intro- 
duced himself to me as Future 
Blayne. 

“You’re Mann’s son, aren’t 
you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Glad to see you. Have you been 
up future yet?” 

“Yes,” I said. I liked the look of 
Blayne. He was not much older 
than myself and he had a fresh, 
open face. He seemed glad to have 
someone to talk to — he was, he 
said, due to go north on one of the 
surveys later in the day and would 
be on his own for the next few 
miles. 

“Do we often go north alone?” I 
asked. 

“Normally, yes. We can work in 
pairs if Clausewitz gives his ap- 
proval, but most Futures prefer to 
work alone. I like company my- 
self — find it a bit lonely up there. 
How about you?” 

“I’ve only been up future once. 
That w r as with Future Denton.” 

“How did you get along with 
him?” 

And so we talked, amiably and 
without the usual guards that 
seemed to go up whenever I had 
talked to other guildsmen. I had 
unconsciously adopted this manner 
myself and at first I suppose I 
might have seemed diffident in his 
company. Within a few minutes, 
though, I found his forthright 
manner relaxing and soon I felt as 
if we were old friends. 

I told him I had made a video 



164 



GALAXY 



recording of the sun. 

“Did you wipe it?” 
“What do you mean?” 
“Erase it from the tape.” 
“No — should I have?” 



H e laughed. “You’ll have the 
Navigators down on you if 
they see it. You’re not supposed to 
use the tapes for anything except 
cross-referenced images of the ter- 
rain.” 

“Will they see it?” 

“They might. If they’re satisfied 
with the map they’ll probably check 
a few cross-references. They’re not 
likely to go through the whole tape. 
But if they do — ” 

“What’s wrong with recording 
the sunset?" 

“Guild rules. Tape is valuable 
and shouldn’t be wasted. But don’t 
worry about it. Why did you tape 
the sun, anyway?” 

“An idea I had. I wanted to try to 
analyze it. It’s an interesting 
shape.” 

He looked at me with new 
interest. 

“What did you make of it?” he 
asked. 

“Inverse values.” 

“That’s right. How did you work 
it out? Did someone tell you?” 

“I remembered something from 
the creche. A hyperbola.” 

“Have you thought it through 
yet? There’s more to it than that. 
Have you thought about the surface 
area?” 

“Future Denton was explaining. 
He said it was very large.” 

Blayne said, “Not very large — in- 
finitely large. North of the city the 



surface curves up until it is almost, 
but never quite, vertical. South of 
the city it becomes almost but not 
quite horizontal. The world is 
spinning on its axis — and with an 
infinite radius it is spinning at 
infinite speed.” 

He delivered this flatly and with- 
out expression. 

“You’re joking,” I said. 

“I’m not. I’m perfectly serious. 
Where we are, near optimum, the 
effects of the spin are the same as 
they would be on Earth planet. 
Farther south, although the angu- 
lar velocity is identical, the speed 
increases. Did you feel the centrif- 
ugal force when you were down 
past?” 

“Yes.” 

‘‘If you'd gone farther you 
wouldn't be here now to remember 
it. That force is bloody real.” 

“I was told,” I said, ‘‘that 
nothing could travel faster than the 
speed of light.” 

“That’s true. Nothing does. In 
theory the world’s circumference is 
infinitely long and moves at infinite 
speed. But there is, or there is con- 
sidered to be, a point where matter 
ceases to exist and serves as an ef- 
fective circumference. That point is 
where the spinning of the world im- 
parts a velocity on the matter 
equivalent to the speed of light.” 
“So it’s not infinite.” 

“Not quite. But bloody big. Look 
at the sun.” 

“I have,” 1 said. “Often.” 
“That’s the same. If it wasn’t 
spinning it would be — literally — 
infinitely large.” 

I said, “Even so, in theory it is 
that large. How can there be room 



INVERTED WORLD 



165 



for more than one object of infinite 
size?” 

“There’s an answer to that. You 
won’t like it.” 

“Try me.” 

“Go to the library and find one 
of the astronomical books. It 
doesn’t matter which. They’re all 
Earth planet books, so they all have 
the same assumptions. If we were 
now on Earth planet we would be 
living in a universe of infinite size, 
which would be occupied by a 
number of large, but finite, bodies. 
Here the inverse is the rule: we live 
in a large but finite universe, oc- 
cupied by a number of bodies of 
infinite size.” 

“It doesn’t make sense.” 

“I know,” said Blayne. “I said 
you wouldn't like it." 

“Where are we?” 

“No one knows.” 

“Where is Earth planet?” 

“No one knows that either.” 

tsaid, “Down past something 
1 strange happened. I was with 
three girls. As we went south, their 
bodies changed. They — ” 

“Did you see anyone up future?” 
“No. We kept away from the 
villages.” 

“North of optimum the local 
people change physically. They be- 
come very tall and thin. The farther 
north we travel, the more the phy- 
sical factors change.” 

“I’ve only been about fifteen 
miles north.” 

“Then you probably wouldn’t 
have noticed anything peculiar. 
Farther than thirty-five miles north 
of optimum, everything is very 
strange.” 



tater I asked, “Why does the 
| j ground move?” 

“I’m not sure,” said Blayne. 

“Is anyone?” 

“No.” 

“Where is it moving to?” 

“More to the point,’’ said 
Blayne, “where is it moving from?" 
“Do you know?” 

“Destaine said that the move- 
ment of the ground was cyclic. He 
says in his Directive that the 
ground is actually stationary at the 
north pole. Farther south, it is 
moving very slowly toward the 
equator. The nearer it approaches 
to the equator the faster it moves, 
both angularly — because of the ro- ’ 
tation — and linearly. At the far- 
thest extreme it is moving in two di- 
rections at once at infinite speed.” 

I stared at him. “But — ” 

“Wait — I haven’t finished. The 
world has a southern part, too. If 
this world were a sphere that part 
would be called a hemisphere, so 
Destaine adopted the term for con- 
venience. In the southern hemis- 
phere the opposite is true. That is, 
the ground moves from the equator 
toward the south pole, steadily 
decelerating. At the south pole it is 
stationary again.” 

“You still haven’t said where the 
ground moves from.” 

“Destaine suggested that north 
and south poles w'ere identical. In 
other words, once any point on the 
ground reaches the south pole it re- 
appears at the north pole.” 

“That’s impossible!” 

“Not according to Destaine. He 
says that the world is shaped like a 
solid hyperbola — that is, all limits 
are infinite. If you can imagine 



166 



GALAXY 



that, the limits adopt the char- 
acteristics of their opposite value. 
An infinite negative becomes an in- 
finite positive — and vice-versa.” 

“Are you quoting him ver- 
batim?” 

“I think so. But you should read 
the original.” 

“I intend to,” I said. 

Before Blayne left the city to go 
north, we agreed that when the 
crisis outside the city was settled we 
would ride together. 

/■\nce more alone, I read through 
the copy of Destaine’s Direc- 
tive that Blayne obtained for me 
from Clausewitz. 

It consisted of several pages of 
closely printed text, much of which 
would have been incomprehensible 
to me had I read it when I had first 
ventured outside the city. Now, 
with my own ideas and experiences 
added to what Blayne had said, it 
served only to confirm. I saw some 
of the sense of the guild system — 
experience had laid the way to 
understanding. 

Much of the Directive consisted 
of theoretical mathematics inter- 
spersed with profuse calculations — 
at these I glanced only briefly. Of 
more interest was what appeared to 
be a hurried journal. Some sections 
caught my attention deeply. 

We are a long way from 
Earth. Our home planet is 
one I doubt we shall ever see 
again, but if we are to survive 
here we must maintain our- 
selves as a microcosm of 
Earth. We are in desolation 



and isolation. All around us 
is a hostile world that daily 
threatens our survival. As 
long as our buildings remain, 
so long shall man survive in 
this place. Protection and 
preservation of our home is 
paramount. 

Later he wrote: 

I have measured the rate of 
regression at one-tenth of a 
statute mile in a period of 
twenty-three hours and forty- 
seven minutes. Although this 
southward drift is slow it is 
relentless — the establishment 
shall therefore be moved at 
least one mile in every ten- 
day period. 

Nothing must stand in the 
way. We have already en- 
countered one river and it 
was crossed at great hazard. 
Doubtless we shall encounter 
further obstacles in the days 
and miles ahead, and by then 
we must be ready. We must 
concentrate on finding some 
indigenous materials that can 
be stored permanently within 
the buildings for later use in 
construction. A bridge should 
not be too difficult to build if 
we have enough warning. 

Sturner has been forward 
and warns of a marshy region 
some miles ahead. Already 
we have sent other teams to 
northeast and northwest to 
determine the extent of this 
marsh. If it is not too wide we 
can deviate from due north 
for a time and make up the 



INVERTED WORLD 



167 



necessary difference later. 

Following this entry were two 
pages of the theory Blayne had 
tried to explain to me. I read it 
through twice and each time it 
made slightly better sense. I left it 
and read on. 

Chen has provided the in- 
ventory of fissionable ma- 
terials I requested. All of it 
waste! With the translat- 
generator, no more need! 

Said nothing to L. I en- 
joy the arguments with him — 
why curtail them now? Future 
generations will be warm! 

Today’s outside tempera- 
ture: -23°C. Still we move 
north. 

Later: 

Trouble with one of the 
caterpillar tracks. T. has ad- 
vised me to authorize stripp- 
ing them. Says that Sturner 
reports from the north that 
he has found what appears to 
be the remains of a railway 
line. Some incredible scheme 
to run the establishment 
along the tracks somehow. T. 
says it would work okay. 

Later: 

Decided to create a guild 
system. Pleasant archaism 
that everyone approves. A 
way of structuring the organi- 
zation without drastically 
changing the way the place is 
run, but I think it might im- 



pose a form to the establish- 
ment that will survive us all. 

Caterpillar track stripping 
proceeding well. Has caused 
a long delay. Hope we can 
catch up. 

Natasha gave birth today: 
boy. 

Doctor S. gave me some 
more pills. Says I’m working 
too hard and have to' rest. 
Later, maybe. 

Toward the end of the Directive, 
a more didactic tone emerged: 

What I have written here 
shall be privy only to those 
who venture outside — no need 
for those inside the establish- 
ment to be reminded of our 
dreadful prospects. We are 
organized enough: we have 
sufficient mechanical power 
and human initiative to main- 
tain us safely in this world 
forever. Those who follow 
must learn the hard way of 
what will happen if we fail to 
exploit either our power or 
our initiative and this knowl- 
edge will suffice to keep both 
working to the maximum. 

Someone from Earth must 
find us one day, God willing. 
Until then our maxim is sur- 
vival at any cost. 

From now, it has been 
agreed and is hereby directed: 

That the ultimate responsi- 
bility lies in the hands of the 
Council. These men shall 
navigate the establishment, 
and be known as Navigators. 
Their number, which shall at 



168 



GALAXY 



no time fall below twelve, 
shall be elected from the 
senior members of the follow- 
ing guilds: 

Track Guild: Who shall be 
responsible for the mainte- 
nance of the railway along 
which the establishment runs; 

Traction Guild; Who shall 
be responsible for the main- 
tenance of the motive power 
of the establishment; 

Future Guild: Who shall 
be responsible for survey- 
ing the lands that lie in future 
time of our establishment; 

Bridge Builders Guild: 
Who shall be responsible for 
safe conduct over physical 
obstacles, should no other 
way be available. 

Further, should it be neces- 
sary to create other guilds in 
the future, no guild may be 
created except by unanimous 
vote of the Council. 

(signed) 

Francis Destaine 



T he major bulk of the Directive 
consisted of short entries dated 
in a sequence that ran from 23rd 
February 1987 and concluded on 
19th August 2023. The final signed 
statement was dated 24th August 
2023. 

There were two final sheets. One 
was a codicil, marking the forma- 
tion of the Barter Guild and the 
Militia Guild. These were undated. 
The other sheet was a graph drawn 
by hand. It showed the hyperbola 
produced by the equation y = l/x, 
and beneath it were some mathe- 



matical signs, which I could not 
understand. 

Such was Destaine’s Directive. 
XXVII 

q uTsiDE the city work on the 
1 tracks w'as proceeding well, 
/hen I joined the track crew's 
most of the rail now behind the city 
had been taken up. Other crews 
were already relaying them from 
the head of the pass down the long 
shallow valley. The atmosphere had 
improved — helped, I think, by the 
successful and undisturbed winch- 
ing of the city away from the river. 
The gradient for the next section 
was in our favor. The cables and 
stays would have to be used, be- 
cause the gradient was not suffi- 
ciently steep to overcome the effects 
of the centrifugal force that could 
be felt even here. 

It was a strange sensation. to 
stand on the ground beside the city 
and see it stretching out in each di- 
rection in an overall horizontal 
way. I knew now that this apparent 
levelness was no such thing; at opti- 
mum, which on the vast scale of 
this world was not substantially dis- 
tant, the ground was actually tilted 
at a full forty-five degree gradient 
toward north. Was this, though, 
any different from living on the sur- 
face of a spherical world like Earth 
planet? I remembered a book I had 
read in the creche, a book written 
in and about a place called 
England. The book had been 
written for young children and de- 
scribed the life of a family planning 
to emigrate to a place called Aus- 
tralia. The children in the book had

believed that where they were going 
they would be upside down and the 
author had gone to some pains to 
describe how all points on a sphere 
appeared to be ‘upright’ because of 
gravitational effects. So it was on 
this world. I had been both north 
and south of optimum and always 
the ground appeared to be level. 

I enjoyed the labor on the tracks. 
It was good once more to be using 
my body and not give myself time to 
think. 

But one loose end remained 
stubbornly untied: Victoria. 

I needed to see her, however dis- 
tasteful such an interview might be, 
and I wanted to settle the situation 
soon. Until I had spoken to her, 
whatever the outcome, I would not 
feel at ease in the city. 

1 was now settled in my accept- 
ance of the physical environment of 
the city. Very few questions re- 
mained to be answered. I under- 
stood how and why the city was 
moved and was aware of the many 
subtle dangers that lay in wait 
should it ever cease its northward 
journey. I knew that the city was 
vulnerable and, at this very time, in 
imminent danger, but I felt its 
problems would be resolved soon. 

But no external considerations 
could settle my personal crisis — I 
had become alienated from a girl I 
had loved in the space of what 
seemed to me to be a few days. 

is a guildsman, I discovered, I 
was allowed to attend meet- 
ings of the Council of Navigators. I 
could not take an active part, but 
no aspect of the session was closed 
to me as a spectator. 



I was told that a meeting was to 
be held and decided to attend it. 

The Navigators met in a small 
hall set just behind the main Navi- 
gation quarters. The session was 
disarmingly informal. I had antici- 
pated much ceremony and air of 
occasion, but the fact was that 
these meetings were crucial to the 
efficient operation of the whole city 
and a businesslike air dominated 
the proceedings from the moment 
the Navigators came into the cham- 
ber and took their seats around a 
table. 

Two Navigators I knew by name, 
Olsson and McMahon, were pres- 
ent and thirteen others. 

The first matter to be discussed 
was the military situation outside. 
One of the Navigators stood up, in- 
troduced himself as Navigator Tho- 
rens and gave a succinct report of 
the current situation. 

The militia had established that 
there were still at least a hundred 
tooks in the neighborhood of the 
city and most of them were armed. 
According to military intelligence, 
their morale was low as a result of 
many losses. This contrasted sharp- 
ly, the Navigator said, with the 
morale of our troops, who felt they 
could contain any further develop- 
ment. They were now in possession 
of twenty-one captured rifles and 
although there was not much am- 
munition, some had been captured 
and the Traction guild had devised 
a method of manufacturing small 
quantities. 

A second Navigator confirmed 
Thorens’ facts. 

The next report was on the con- 
dition of the city’s structure. 



170 



GALAXY 



There was considerable discus- 
sion about how much rebuilding 
should be carried out and how 
soon. It was stated that there was 
pressure on the Domestic adminis- 
trators and that sleeping accommo- 
dation was at a premium. The 
Navigators agreed that a new dor- 
mitory block should be given 
priority. 

This discussion led naturally into 
wider issues and these were of great 
interest to me. 

As far as I could tell, the views of 
the Navigators present were di- 
vided. One school of thought was of 
the opinion that the previous 
“closed-city” policy should be rein- 
troduced as soon as possible. The 
others thought that it had outlived 
its purpose and should be perma- 
nently abandoned. 

It seemed to me that this was a 
crucial issue, one that could radi- 
cally alter the social structure of the 
city — and indeed, this was the 
undercurrent of the discussion. 
Doing away with the closed system 
would mean that anyone growing 
up in the city would gradually learn 
the truth about the city’s situation. 
It would mean a new way of educa- 
tion and would bring subtle 
changes in the powers of the guilds 
themselves. 

In the end, after many calls for 
votes and several amendments, 
there was a show of hands. By a 
majority of one it was decided not 
to reintroduce the closed-city sys- 
tem for the time being. 

More revelations followed. It 
transpired from the next item that 
there were seventeen transferred 
women inside the city, who had 



been there since before the first at- 
tack by the tooks. There was some 
discussion about what should be 
done with them. The meeting was 
informed that the women had said 
they wished to stay in the city — and 
it was immediately clear that it was 
possible that the attacks had been 
made in an attempt to free the 
women. 

Another vote: the women would 
be allowed to stay within the city for 
as long as they wished. 

It was also decided not to rein- 
troduce the down past initiative test 
for apprentices. I understood that 
this had been suspended after the 
first attack and several Navigators 
were in favor of now bringing it 
back. The meeting was told that 
twelve apprentices were known to 
have been killed down past and an- 
other five were unaccounted for. 
The suspension remained for the 
time being. 

I was fascinated by what I heard. 
I hadn’t realized before the extent 
to which the Navigators were in 
touch with the practicalities of the 
system. Nothing specific had been 
said, but there was a general feeling 
among some of the guildsmen that 
the Navigators were a group of 
aging fuddyduddies out of touch 
with reality. Advanced in years 
some of them certainly were, but 
their perceptions had not faded. 
Looking around at the mostly 
empty guild seats, I reflected that 
perhaps more guildsmen should 
attend the Navigators’ meetings. 

T here was more business to deal 
with. The report that Denton 
and I had made of the terrain to the 



INVERTED WORLD 



171 



north was presented by Navigator 
McMahon, with the added infor- 
mation that two other surveys were 
presently being conducted and that 
the results would be known within a 
day or two. 

The meeting agreed that the city 
should follow the provisional route 
marked by Denton and myself until 
any better route was devised. 

Finally the subject of the city’s 
traction was raised by Navigator 
Lucan. He said that the Traction 
guild had come up with a scheme 
for moving the city slightly faster. 
Regaining ground on optimum 
would be a major step toward re- 
turning the city' to a normal situa- 
tion, he argued, and there was 
agreement to this. 

The proposal, he said, was for 
the city to be put onto a continu- 
ous-traction schedule. This would 
involve a greater liaison with the 
Track guild and perhaps a greater 
risk of cable break. But he argued 
that as we were now short of much 
valuable rail stock after the burn- 
ing of the bridge, the city would 
have to make shorter hauls. The 
Traction guild’s suggestion was to 
maintain a shorter length of track 
actually laid to the north of the city 
and to keep the winches running 
permanently. They would be 
phased out for periodic overhaul, 
and as the gradients of future terri- 
tory were largely in our favor we 
could keep the city running at a 
speed sufficient to bring us back to 
optimum within twenty or twenty- 
five miles of elapsed time. 

There were few objections to this 
scheme, although the chairman 
called for a detailed report. When 



the vote was cast the result was nine 
in favour, six against. The city 
would transfer to continuous run- 
ning as soon as could be managed. 



XXVIII 

t was due to leave the city for a 
I survey mission to the north. In 
the morning I had been called away 
from my work on the tracks and 
Clausewitz had given me my brief- 
ing. I would leave the city the next 
day and travel twenty-five miles to 
the north of optimum, reporting 
back on the nature of the terrain 
and the positions of various settle- 
ments. I was given the choice of 
working alone or with another 
Future guildsman. Recalling the 
new and welcome acquaintanceship 
with Blayne, I requested that he 
and I work together and this was 
granted. 

I was eager to leave. I felt no ob- 
ligation to remain on the manual 
work of the tracks. Men who had 
never been outside the city were 
working well as teams and more 
progress was made than at any time 
we had employed local labor. 

The last attack by the tooks now 
seemed a long way behind us and 
morale was good. We had made it 
to the pass in safety — ahead was 
the long slope through the valley. 
The weather was fine and hopes 
were high. 

I n the evening I returned to the 
city. I had decided to talk over 
the survey mission with Blayne and 
spend the night in the Futures’ 
quarters. We would be ready to 



172 



GALAXY 



leave at first light. 

Walking through the corridors, I 
glanced into an open doorway and 
saw Victoria. 

She was working alone in a tiny 
office, checking through a large 
batch of papers. I went in and 
closed the door behind me. 

“Oh, it's you,” she said. 

“You don’t mind?” 

“I’m very busy.” 

“So am I.” 

“Then leave me alone and get on 
with whatever it is.” 

“No,” I said. “I want to talk to 
you.” 

“Some other time.” 

“You can’t avoid me forever.” 
“1 don’t have to talk to you 
now,” she said. 

I grabbed at her pen, knocking it 
from her hand. Papers fell to the 
floor and she gasped, 

“What happened, Victoria? Why 
didn’t you wait for me?” 

She stared down at the scattered 
papers and made no answer. 
“Come on — tell me.” 

“It was a long time ago. Does it 
still matter to you?” 

“Yes.” 

She was looking at me now and I 
stared back at her. She had 
changed a lot and seemed older. 
She was more assured, more her 
own woman — but I could recognize 
the familiar way she held her head, 
the way her hands were clenched: 
half a fist, two fingers erect and 
interfolded. 

“Helward, I’m sorry if you were 
hurt, but I’ve been through a lot, 
too. Will that do?” 

“You know it won’t. What about 
all the things we talked about?” 



“Such as?” 

“The private things, the inti- 
macies.” 

“Your oath is safe. You needn’t 
worry about that.” 

“I wasn’t even thinking of it,” I 
said. “What about the other things, 
about you and me?” 

“The whispered exchanges in 
bed?" 

I winced. “Yes.” 

“They were a long time ago.” 
Perhaps my reaction showed, for 
suddenly her manner softened. 
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be 
callous.” 

“Okay. Say what you like.” 

“No — it’s just that — I wasn’t ex- 
pecting to see you. You were gone 
so long! You could have been dead 
and no one would tell me any- 
thing.” 

“Whom did you ask?” 

“Your boss. Clausewitz. All he’d 
say was that you’d left the city.” 
“But I told you where I was go- 
ing. I said I had to go south.” 
“And you said you’d be back in a 
few miles’ time.” 

“I know,” I said. “I was wrong.” 
“What happened?” 

“I — was delayed.” I couldn’t 
even begin to explain. 

“That’s all? You were delayed?” 
“IT was a lot farther than I 
thought.” 

She began shuffling her papers 
aimlessly, making them into a 
semblance of a tidy pile. But she 
was just working her hands — I had 
broken through. 

“You never saw David, did 
you?” 

“David? Is that what you called 
him?”

“He was — ” She looked up at me 
again and her eyes were brimming 
with tears. “I had to put him in the 
creche — there was so much work to 
do. I saw him every day and then 
the first attack came. I had to be on 
a fire point, and couldn’t — Later 
we went down to the — ” 

I closed my eyes, turned away. 
She put her face in her hands, 
started to cry. 1 leaned against the 
wall, resting my face against my 
forearm. A few seconds later I 
started to cry, too. 

A woman came through the door 
quickly, saw what was happening. 
She closed the door again. This 
time I leaned my weight against it 
to prevent further interruptions. 



tater Victoria said, “I thought 
I j you would never come back. 
There was a lot of confusion in the 
city, but I managed to find some- 
one from your guild. He said that a 
lot of apprentices had been killed 
when they were in the south. I told 
him how long you had been gone. 
He wouldn’t commit himself. All I 
knew was how long you’d been gone 
and when you had said you’d be 
back. You were away nearly two 
years, Helward.” 

“I was warned,” I said. “But I 
didn’t believe the warning.” 

“Why not?” 

“I had to walk a distance of 
about eighty miles — there and 
back. I thought I could do it in a 
few days. No one in the guild told 
me why I couldn’t.” 

“But they knew?” 
“Undoubtedly.” 

“They could have at least waited 



until we’d had the child.” 

“I had to go when I was told. It 
was part of the guild training.” 
Victoria was now more composed 
than before — the emotional reac- 
tion had completely destroyed any 
antipathy between us and we were 
able to talk more rationally. She 
picked up the fallen papers, ar- 
ranged them into a pile, then put 
them away into a drawer. There 
was a chair by the opposite wall and 
I sat in it. 

“You know the guild system is 
going to have to change,” she said. 
“Not drastically.” 

“It's going to break down com- 
pletely. It has to. In effect it’s hap- 
pened already. Anyone can go out- 
side the city now. The Navigators 
will cling to the old system for as 
long as they can because they’re 
living in the past, but — ” 

“They’re not as hidebound as 
you think,” I said. 

“They’ll try to bring back the 
secrecy and the suppression as soon 
as they can.” 

“You’re wrong,” I said flatly. “I 
know you’re wrong.” 

“All right — but certain things 
will have to change. There’s no one 
in the city now who doesn’t know 
the danger we’re in. We’ve been 
cheating and stealing our way 
across this land and that has 
created the danger. It’s time for it 
to stop.” 

“Victoria, you don’t — ” 

“You only have to look at the 
damage! There were thirty-nine 
children killed! God knows how 
much destruction. Do you think we 
can survive if the people outside 
keep on attacking us?”

“The situation is quieter now. 
It’s under control.” 

S he shook her head. “I don’t 
care what the current situation 
looks like. I’m thinking about the 
longterm. All our troubles are ulti- 
mately created by the city’s being 
moved. That one condition pro- 
duces the danger. We move across 
other peoples’ land. We bargain for 
manpower to move the city. We 
take women into the city to have sex 
with men they hardly know — and 
all in the effort of keeping the city 
moving.” 

“The city can never stop,” I said. 
“You see — you are already a part 
of the guild system. Always the 
system gives us this flat statement, 
without looking at it in a wider 
light. The city must move, the city 
must move. Don’t accept it as an 
absolute.” 

“It is an absolute. I know what 
would happen if the city stopped." 
“Well?" 

“It would be destroyed and 
everyone woudl be killed.” 

“You can't prove that.” 

“No — but I know it would be 
so.” 

“I think you’re wrong,” said Vic- 
toria. “And I'm not alone. Even in 
the last few days I’ve heard it said 
by others. People can think for 
themselves. They’ve been outside, 
seen what it’s like. There’s no dan- 
ger apart from the danger we create 
for ourselves.” 

I said, “Look, this isn’t our con- 
flict. I wanted to see you to talk 
about us.” 

“But it’s all the same. What 
happened to us is implicitly bound 



up in the ways of the city. If you 
hadn’t beem a guildsman we might 
still be living together.” 

“Is there any chance — ” 

“Do you want it?” 

“I’m not sure,” I said. 

“It’s impossible. For me, at 
least. I couldn’t reconcile what I 
believe with accepting your way of 
life. We’ve tried it and it separated 
us. Anyway, I’m living with — ” 

“I know.” 

She looked at me and I felt at 
second hand the alienation she had 
experienced. 

“Don’t you have any beliefs, Hel- 
ward?” she said. 

“Only that the guild system, for 
all its imperfections, is sound.” 
“And you want us to live together 
again, living out two separate be- 
liefs. It couldn't work.” 

We had both changed a lot — she 
was right. It was no good speculat- 
ing about what might have been in 
other circumstances. There was no 
way of making a personal relation- 
ship distinct from the overall 
scheme of the city. 

Even so, I tried again, attempt- 
ing to articulate the apparent sud- 
denness of what had happened, 
attempting to find a formula that 
could somehow revive the early feel- 
ings we had had for each other. To 
be fair, Victoria responded in kind, 
but I think we had both arrived at 
the same conclusion by our sepa- 
rate routes. I felt better for seeing 
her and when I left her and walked 
toward the Futures' quarters I was 
aware that we had succeeded in re- 
solving the worst of the remaining 
issue.

It was the computer’s revenge. 
In rage, in frenzy, he turned us 
into monstrosities, imprison-

banks. Now I am a great soft 
jelly thing. 

I have no mouth. And I must 
scream. 

Harlan Ellison’s "I Have No 
Mouth and I Must Scream” 
packs such a wallop it walked 
off with a Hugo — science fic- 
tion’s Oscar — for the best short 
story of the year. Ellison's wild 
tale is waiting for you in a 
sensational 864-page, double 
volume of all the Hugo winners 
from 1955 to 1970. This anthol- 
ogy can be yours as part of an 
equally sensational 4-books- 
for-100 offer when you join the 
Science Fiction Book Club.
