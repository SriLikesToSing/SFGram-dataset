I. 



A BRIGHT FLASH of insight, tO 
match that peculiar sun . 

There it was . Displayed 
within that light, a thing I had only 
seen self-illuminated in darkness up 
until then: the Pattern, the great 
Pattern of Amber cast upon an oval 
shelf beneath/above a strange sky- 
sea. 

.... And I knew, perhaps by 
that within me which bound us, that 
this had to be the real one. Which 
meant that the Pattern in Amber 
was but its first shadow. Which 
meant — 

Which meant that Amber itself 
was but a shadow, albeit a special 
one, for the Pattern was not carried 
over into places beyond the realm 
of Amber, Rebma and Tir-na 
Nog’th. Meaning, then, that this 
place to which we had come was, 
by the law of precedence and 
configuration, the real Amber. 

I turned to a smiling Ganelon, his 
beard and wild hair molten in the 
merciless light. 

“How did you know?” I asked 
him. 

“You know I am a very good 
guesser, Corwin,” he replied, “and 
I recall everything you ever told me 
about how things work in Amber: 
how its shadow and those of your 
struggles are cast across the worlds. 
I often wondered, in thinking of the 
black road, whether anything could 
have cast such a shadow into 
Amber itself. And I imagined that 
such a something would have to be 
extremely basic, powerful and 
secret.” He gestured at the scene 
before us. “Like that.” 

“Continue,” I said. 



His expression changed and he 
shrugged. 

“So there had to be a layer of 
reality deeper than your Amber,” 
he explained, “where the dirty 
work was done. Your patron beast 
led us to what seems to be such a 
place, and that blot on the Pattern 
looks to be the dirty work. You 
agreed. ’ ’ 

I nodded. 

“It was your perceptiveness 
rather than the conclusion itself 
which stunned me so,” I said. 

“You beat me to it,” admitted 
Random, off to my right, “but the 
feeling has found its way into my 
intestines — to put it delicately. I do 
believe that somehow that is the 
basis of our world down there.” 

“An outsider can sometimes see 
things better than one who is part of 
them,” Ganelon offered. 

Random glanced at me and re- 
turned his attention to the spectacle. 

“Do you think things will change 
anymore,” he asked, “if we go 
down for a closer look?” 

“Only one way to find out,” I 
said. 

“Single file, then,” Random 
agreed. “I’ll lead.” 

“All right.” 

Random guided his mount to the 
right, the left, the right, in a long 
series of switchblades which zigged 
us and zagged us across most of the 
face of the wall. Continuing in the 
order we had maintained all day, I 
followed him and Ganelon came 
last. 

“Seems stable enough now,” 
Random called back. 

“So far,” I said. 

“Some sort of opening in the 
rocks below.”

GALAXY 




I leaned forward. There was a 
cavemouth back to the right, on a 
level with the oval plain. Its situa- 
tion was such that it had been hid- 
den from sight when we had oc- 
cupied our higher position. 

“We pass fairly near it,” I said. 

“ — quickly, cautiously and si- 
lently,” Random added, drawing 
his blade. 

I unsheathed Grayswandir, and 
one turn back above me Ganelon 
drew his own weapon. 

We did not pass the opening, but 
turned leftward once more before 
we came to it. We moved within 
ten or fifteen feet of it, however, 
and I detected an unpleasant odor 
which I could not identify. The 
horses must have done a better job 
of it, though, or been pessimists by 
nature, because they flattened their 
ears, widened their nostrils and 
made alarmed noises while turning 
against the reins. They calmed, 
however, as soon as we had made 
the turn and begun moving away 
once again. They did not suffer a 
relapse until we reached the end of 
our descent and moved to approach 
the damaged Pattern. They refused 
to go near it. 

Random dismounted. He ad- 
vanced to the edge of the design, 
paused and stared. After, a time, he 
spoke without looking back. 

“It follows that the damage was 
deliberate,” he said, “from ev- 
erything else that we know.” 

“It seems to follow,” I said. 

“It is also obvious that we were 
brought here for a reason.” 

“I’d say so.” 

“Then it does not take too much 
imagination to conclude that our 
purpose for being here is to de- 

the hand of OBERON 



termine how the Pattern was 
damaged and what might be done to 
repair it.” 

“Possibly. What is your diag- 
nosis?” 

“Nothing yet.” 

He moved along the perimeter of 
the figure, off to the right where the 
smear-effect began. I resheathed my 
blade and prepared to dismount. 
Ganelon reached over and took hold 
of my shoulder. 

“1 can make it myself — ” I 
began. 

But, “Corwin,” he said, ignoring 
my words, “there does appear to be 
a small irregularity out toward the 
middle of the Pattern. It does not 
look like something that be- 
longs ...” 

“Where?” 

He pointed and I followed the 
gesture. 

There was some foreign object 
near to the center. A stick? A 
stone? A stray bit of paper. ? It 
was impossible to tell from this 
distance. 

“I see it,” I said. 

We dismounted and headed to- 
ward Random, who by then was 
crouched at the extreme right of the 
figure, examining the discoloration. 

“Ganelon’s spotted something 
out toward the center,” I said. 

Random nodded. 

“I’ve noticed it,” he replied. “I 
was just trying to decide on the best 
way to head out for a better look. I 
do not relish the notion of walking 
a broken Pattern. On the other 
hand, I was wondering what I 
would be laying myself open to if I 
tried heading in across the black- 
ened area. What do you think?” 

“Walking what there is of the 

9 




Pattern would take some time,” I 
said, ‘‘If the resistance is on par 
with what it is at home. Also, we 
have been taught that it is death to 
stray from it — and this setup would 
force me to leave it when I reach 
the blot. On the other hand, as you 
say, I might be alerting our enemies 
by treading on the black. So — ” 

‘‘So neither of you is going to do 
it,” Ganelon interrupted. ‘‘I am.” 

Then, without waiting for a re- 
ply, he took a running leap into the 
black sector, raced along it toward 
the center, paused long enough to 
pick up some small object, turned 
and headed back. 

. Moments later, he stood before 
us. 

‘‘That was a risky thing to do,” 
Random said. 

He nodded. 

‘‘But you two would still be 
debating it if I hadn’t.” He raised 
his hand and extended it. ‘‘Now, 
what do you make of this?” 

He was holding a dagger. Im- 
paled on it was a rectangle of 
stained pasteboard. I took them 
from him. 

‘‘Looks like a Trump,” Random 
said. 

“Yes.” 

I worked the card loose, 
smoothed down the torn sections. 
The man I regarded upon it was 
half-familiar — meaning of course 
that he was also half-strange. Light, 
straight hair, a trifle sharp-featured, 
a small smile, somewhat slight of 
build. 

I shook my head. 

“I do not know him,” I said. 

“Let me see.” 

Random took the card from me, 
frowned at it. 

10 



“No,” he said after a time. “I j 
don’t either. It almost seems as| 
though I should, but . No.” 

At that moment, the horses 
renewed their complaints much 
more forcefully. And we needed but 
turn partway to learn the cause of 
their discomfort, in that it had cho- 
sen that moment to emerge from thei 
cave. 

“Damn,” said Random. - 

I agreed with him. ^ 

Ganelon cleared his throat, took 
forth his blade. i 

“Anyone know what it is?” he 
asked quietly. 

My first impression of the beast 
was that it was snakelike, both from 
its movements and because of the 
fact that its long thick tail seemed^ 
more a continuation of its long thin 
body than a mere appendage. It 
moved on four double-jointed legs, 
however, large-footed and wickedly 
clawed. Its narrow head was 
beaked, and it swung from side to 
side as it advanced, showing us one 
pale blue eye and then the other. 
Large wings were folded against its 
sides, purple and leathery. It 
possessed neither hair nor feathers, 
though there were scaled areas 
across its breast, shoulders, back and 
along the length of its tail. From 
beak-bayonet to twisting tail-tip it 
seemed a little over three meters. 
There was a small tinkling sound as 
it moved, and 1 caught a flash of 
something shining brightly at its 
throat. 

“Closest thing I know,” said 
Random, “is a heraldic beast — the 
griffin. Only this one is bald and 
purple.” 

“Definitely not our national 
bird,” I added, drawing Grays-j 

GALAXvj 





wandir and swinging its point into 
line with the creature’s head. 

The beast darted a red, forked 
tongue. It raised its wings a few 
inches, then let them fall. When its 
head swung to the right its tail 
moved to the left, then left and 
right, right and left — producing a 
near-hypnotic, flowing effect as it 
advanced. 

It seemed more concerned with 
the horses than with us, however, 
for its course was directed well past 
us toward the spot where our 
mounts stood quivering and 
stamping. I moved to interpose 
myself. 

At that point, it reared. 

Its wings went up and out, 
spreading like a pair of slack sails 
suddenly caught by a gust of wind. 
It was back on its hind legs and 
towering above us, seeming to 

the hand of OBERON 



occupy at least four times the space 
it had previously. And then it 
shrieked, a godawful, hunting 
scream or challenge that left my 
ears ringing. With that, it snapped 
those wings downward and sprang, 
becoming temporarily airborne. 

The horses bolted and ran. The 
beast was beyond our reach. It was 
only then that I realized what the 
bright flash and the tinkling had 
represented. The thing was tethered, 
by means of a long chain running 
back into the cave. The exact length 
of its leash was immediately a 
question of more than academic 
interest. 

I turned as it passed, hissing, 
flapping and falling, beyond us. It 
had not possessed sufficient 
momentum to obtain true flight in 
that brief rush upward. I saw that 
Star and Firedrake were retreating 



11 



toward the far end of the oval. 
Random’s mount lago, on the, other 
hand, had bolted in the direction of 
the Pattern. 

The beast touched ground again, 
turned as if to pursue lago, ap- 
peared to study us once more and 
froze. It was much nearer this 
time — under four meters — and it 
cocked its head, showing us its 
right eye, then opened its beak and 
made a soft cawing noise. 

“What say we rush it now?” said 
Random. 

“No. Wait. There is something 
peculiar about its behavior.” 

It had dropped its head while I 
was speaking, spreading its wings 
downward. It struck the ground 
three times with its beak and looked 
up again. Then it drew its wings 
partway back toward its body. Its 
tail twitched once, then swung more 
vigorously from side to side. It 
opened its beak and repeated the 
cawing sound. 

At that moment we were dis- 
tracted. 

lago had entered the Pattern, well 
to the side of the darkened area. 
Five or six meters into it, standing 
obliquely across the lines of power, 
he was caught near one of the Veil 
points like an insect on a piece of 
flypaper. He cried loudly as the 
sparks came up about him and his 
mane rose and stood erect. 

Immediately, the sky began to 
darken directly overhead. But it was 
no cloud of water vapor which had 
begun to coalesce. Rather, it was a 
perfectly circular formation which 
had appeared, red at the center, 
yellow nearer the edges, turning in 
a clockwise direction. A sound like 
a single bell chime followed by the 

12 



growl of a bullroarer suddenly came 
to our ears. 

lago continued his struggles, first 
freeing his right front foot, then 
entangling it again as he freed the 
left, neighing wildly the while. The 
sparks were up to his shoulders by 
then, and he shook them like 
raindrops from his body and neck, 
his entire form taking on a soft, 
buttery glow. 

The roaring increased in volume 
and small lightnings began to play 
at the heart of the red thing above 
us. A rattling noise caught my 
attention at that moment, and I 
glanced downward to discover that 
the purple griffin had slithered past 
and moved to interpose itself 
between us and the loud red 
phenomenon. It crouched like a 
gargoyle, facing away from us, 
watching the spectacle. 

Just then, lago freed both front 
feet and reared. There was some- 
thing insubstantial about him by 
then, what with his brightness and 
the spark-shot indistinctness of his 
outline. He might have neighed at 
that moment, but all other sounds 
were submerged by the incessant 
roar from above. 

A funnel descended from the 
noise formation — bright, flashing, 
wailing now, and tremendously fast. 
It touched the rearing horse, and for 
a moment his outline expanded 
enormously, becoming increasingly 
tenuous in direct porportion to this 
effect. And then he was gone. For a 
brief interval, the funnel remained 
stationary, like a perfectly balanced 
top. Then the sound began to di- 
minish. 

The trunk raised itself, slowly, to 
a point but a small distance — 

GALAXY 




perhaps the height of a man — above 
the Pattern. Then it snapped up- 
wards as quickly as it had de- 
scended. 

The wailing ceased. The roaring 
began to subside. The miniature 
lightninps faded within the circle. 
The entire formation began to pale 
and slow. A moment later, it was 
but a bit of darkness; another 
^fnoment and it was gone. 

No trace of lago remained 
anywhere that I could see. 

“Don’t ask me,’’ I said when 
Random turned toward me. “I don’t 
know either.’’ 

He nodded, then directed his 
attention toward our purple com- 
panion who was just then rattling 
his chain. 

“What about Charlie here?’’ he 
asked, fingering his blade. 

“I had the distinct impression he 
was trying to protect us,” I said, 
taking a step forward. “Cover me. I 
want to try something.” 

“You sure you can move fast 
enough?” he asked. “With that 
side ...” 

“Don’t worry,” I said, a trifle 
more heartily than necessary, and I 
kept moving. 

He was correct about my left 
side, where the healing knife wound 
still ached dully and seemed to 
exercise a drag on my movements. 
But Grayswandir was still in my 
right hand and this was one of those 
occasions when my trust in my 
instincts was running high. I had 
relied on this feeling in the past 
with good results. There are times 
when such gambles just seem to be 
in order. 

Random moved ahead and to the 
right. I turned sidewise and ex- 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



tended my left hand as you would 
in introducing yourself to a strange 
dog, slowly. Our heraldic compan- 
ion had risen from its crouch and 
was turning. 

It faced us again and studied 
Ganelon, off to my left. Then it 
regarded my hand. It lowered its 
head and repeated the ground- 
striking movement, cawed very 
softly — a small, bubbling sound — 
raised its head and slowly extended 
it. It wagged its great tail, touched 
my fingers with its beak, then 
repeated the performance. Careful- 
ly, I placed my hand on its head. 
The wagging increased; its head 
remained motionless. I scratched it 
gently about the neck and it turned 
its head slowly then, as if enjoying 
it. I withdrew my hand and dropped 
back a pace. 

“I think we’re friends,” I said 
softly. “Now you try it. Random.” 
“Are you kidding?” 

“No, I’m sure you’re safe. Try 
it.” 

“What will you do if you are 
wrong?” 

“Apologize.” 

“Great.” 

He advanced and offered his 
hand. The beast remained friendly. 

“All right,” he said half a mi- 
nute or so later, still stroking its 
neck, “what have we proved?” 
“That he is a watchdog.” 

“What is he watching?” 

“The Pattern, apparently.” 
“Offhand then,” said Random, 
moving back, “I would say that his 
work leaves something to be de- 
sired.” He gestured at the dark 
area. “Which is understandable, if 
he is this friendly to anyone who 
doesn’t eat oats and whinny.” 



13 




“My guess is that he is quite 
selective. It is also possible that he 
was set here after the damage was 
done, to defend against further 
unappreciated activity.” 

“Who set him?” 

“I’d like to know myself. 
Someone on our side, apparently.” 

“You can now test your theory 
further by letting Ganelon approach 
him.” 

Ganelon did not move. 

“It may be you have a family 
smell about you,” he finally said, 
“and he only favors Amberites. So I 
will pass, thank you.” 

“All right. It is not that im- 
portant. Your guesses have been 
good so far. How do you interpret 
events?” 

“Of the two factions out for the 
throne,” he said, “that composed 
of Brand, Fiona and Bleys was, as 
you said, more aware of the nature 
of the forces that play about Amber. 
Brand did not supply you with 
particulars — unless you omitted 
some incidents he might have 
related — but my guess is that this 
damage to the Pattern represents the 
means by which their allies gained 
access to your realm. One or more 
of them did that damage, which 
provided the dark route. If the 
watchdog here responds to a family 
smell or some other identifying 
information you all possess, then he 
could actually have been here all 
along and not seen fit to move 
against the despoilers.” 

“Possibly,” Random observed. 
“Any idea how it was ac- 
complished?” 

“Perhaps,” he replied. “I will 
let you demonstrate it for me, if 
you are willing.” 

14 



“What does it involve?” 

“Come this way,’’ he said, 
turning and heading over to the 
edge of the Pattern. 

I followed him. Random did the 
same. The watchgriffin slunk at my 
side. 

Ganelon turned and extended his 
hand. 

“Corwin, may I trouble you for 
that dagger I fetched us?” 

“Here,” I said, drawing it from 
my belt and passing it over. 

“I repeat, what does it involve?” 
Random inquired. 

“The blood of Amber,” Ganelon 
replied. 

“I am not so sure I like this 
idea,” Random said. 

‘ ‘All you have to do is prick your 
finger with it,” he said, extending 
the blade, “and let a drop fall upon 
the Pattern.” 

“What will happen?” 

“Let’s try it and see.” 

Random looked at me. 

“What do you say?” he asked. 

“Go ahead. Let’s find out. I’m 
intrigued. ’ ’ 

He nodded. 

“Okay.” 

He received the blade from 
Ganelon and nicked the tip of his 
left little finger. He squeezed the 
finger then, holding it above the 
Pattern. A tiny red bead appeared, 
grew larger, quivered, fell. 

Immediately, a wisp of smoke 
rose from the spot where it struck, 
accompanied by a tiny crackling 
noise. 

“I’ll be damned!” said Random, 
apparently fascinated. 

A tiny stain had come into being, 
gradually spreading to about the 
size of a half dollar. 



GALAXY 




“There you are,” said Ganelon. 
“That is how it was done.” 

The stain was indeed a miniature 
counterpart of the massive blot 
further to our right. The watchgrif- 
fin gave forth a small shriek and 
drew back, rapidly turning his head 
from one of us to the other. 

“Easy, fellow. Easy,” I said, 
reaching out and calming him once 
more. 

“But what could have caused 
such a large — ” Random began, 
and then he nodded slowly. 

“What indeed?” said Ganelon. 
“I see no mark to show where your 
horse was destroyed.” 

“The blood of Amber,” Random 
said. “You are just full of insights 
today, aren’t you?” 

“Ask Corwin to tell you of 
Lorraine, the place where I dwelled 
for so long,” he said, “the place 
where the dark circle grew. I am 
alert to the effects of those powers, 
though I knew them then only at a 
distance. These matters have be- 
come clearer to me with each new 
thing I have learned from you. Yes, 
I have insights now that I know 
more of these workings. Ask Cor- 
win of the mind of his general.” 
“Corwin,” Random said, “give 
me the pierced Trump.” 

I withdrew it from my pocket and 
smoothed it. The stains seemed 
more ominous now. Another thing 
also struck me. I did not believe 
that it had been executed by 
Dworkin, sage, mage, artist and 
one-time mentor to the children of 
Oberon. It had not occurred to me 
until that moment that anyone else 
might be capable of producing one. 
While the style of this one did seem 
somehow familiar, it was not his 

the hand of oberon 



work. Where had I seen that de- 
liberate line before, less spontane- 
ous than the master’s, as though 
every movement had been totally 
intellectualized before the pen 
touched the paper? And there was 
something else wrong with it — a 
quality of idealization of a different 
order from that of our own Trumps, 
almost as if the artist had been 
working with old memories, 
glimpses or descriptions rather than 
a living subject. 

“The Trump, Corwin. If you 
please,” Random said. 

There was that about the way in 
which he said it to make me 
hesitate. It gave rise to the feeling 
that he was somehow a jump ahead 
of me on something important, a 
feeling which I did not like at all. 

“I’ve petted old ugly here for 
you, and I’ve just bled for the 
cause, Corwin. Now let’s have it.” 

1 handed it over, my uneasiness 
increasing as he held it in his hand 
and furrowed his brow. Why was I 
suddenly the stupid one? Does a 
night in Tir-na Nog’th slow cere- 
bration? Why — 

Random began to curse, a string 
of profanities unsurpassed by 
anything encountered in my long 
military career. 

Then, “What is it?” I said. “I 
don’t understand.” 

“The blood of Amber,” he fi- 
nally said. “Whoever did it walked 
the Pattern first, you see. Then they 
stood there at the center and con- 
tacted him via this Trump. When he 
responded and a firm contact was 
achieved, they stabbed him. His 
blood flowed upon the Pattern, 
obliterating that part of it, as mine 
did here.” 



15 




He was silent for the space of 
several deep breaths. 

“It smacks of a ritual,” I said. 

“Damn rituals!” he said. “Damn 
all of them! One of them is going to 
die, Corwin. I am going to kill 
him — or her.” 

“I still do not — ” 

“I am a fool,” he said, “for not 
seeing it right away. Look! Look 
closely!” 

He thrust the pierced Trump at 
me. I stared. I still did not see. 

“Now look at me!” he said. 
“See me!” 

I did. Then I looked back at the 
card. 

I realized what he meant. 

“I was never anything to him but 
a whisper of life in the darkness. 
But they used my son for this,” he 
said. “That has to be a picture of 
Martin.” 



II. 

Standing there beside the bro- 
ken Pattern, regarding a picture of 
the man who may or may not have 
been Random’s son, who may or 
may not have died of a knife wound 
received from a point within the 
Pattern, I turned and took a giant 
step back within my mind for an 
instant replay of the events which 
had brought me to this point of 
peculiar revelation. I had learned so 
many new things recently that the 
occurrences of the past few years 
seemed almost to cdnstitute a 
different story than they had while I 
was living them. Now this new 
possibility and a number of things it 
implied had just shifted the 
perspective again. 

16 



I had not even been aware of my 
name when I had awakened in 
Greenwood, that private hospital in 
upstate New York where I had 
spent two totally blank weeks 
subsequent to my accident. It was 
only recently that I had been told 
that the accident itself had been 
engineered by my brother Bleys, 
immediately following my escape 
from the Porter Sanitarium in 
Albany. I got this story from my 
brother Brand, who had railroaded 
me into Porter in the first place, by 
means of fake psychiatric evidence. 
At Porter, I had been subjected to 
electroshock therapy over the span 
of several days, results ambiguous 
but presumably involving the return 
of a few memories. This was ap- 
parently what had scared Bleys into 
making the attempt on my life at 
the time of my escape, shooting out 
a couple of my tires on a curve 
above a lake. This doubtless would 
have resulted in my death, had 
Brand not been a step behind Bleys 
and out to protect his insurance 
investment, me. He said he had 
gotten word to the cops, dragged 
me out of the lake and administered 
first aid until help arrived. Shortly 
after that, he was captured by his 
former partners— Bleys and our 
sister Fiona — who confined him in a 
guarded tower in a distant place in 
Shadow. 

There had been two cabals, 
plotting and counterplotting after the 
throne, treading on one another’s 
heels, breathing down one another’s 
necks and doing anything else to 
one another that might suggest itself 
at that range. Our brother Eric, 
backed by brothers Julian and 
Caine, had been preparing to take 

GALAXY 




the throne, left long vacant by the 
unexplained absence of our father, 
Oberon. Unexplained to Eric, Julian 
and Caine, that is. To the other 
group, consisting of Bleys, Fiona 
and — formerly — Brand, it was not 
unexplained because they were 
responsible for it. They had ar- 
ranged for this state of affairs to 
come into being in order to open 
the way for Bleys’ accession to the 
throne. But Brand had committed a 
tactical error in attempting to obtain 
Caine’s assistance in their play for 
the throne, in that Caine decided a 
better deal obtained in upholding 
Eric’s part. This left Brand under 
close scrutiny, but did not im- 
mediately result in the betrayal of 
his partners’ identities. At about 
that time, Bleys and Fiona decided 
to employ their secret allies against 
Eric. Brand had demurred in this, 
fearing the strength of those forces, 
and as a result had been rejected by 
Bleys and Fiona. With everyone on 
his back then, he had sought to 
upset the balance of powers com- 
pletely by journeying to the shadow 
Earth where Eric had left me to die 
centuries before. It was only later 
that Eric had learned that I had not 
died but was possessed of total 
amnesia, which was almost as 
good, had set sister Flora to watch 
over my exile and hoped that that 
was the last of it. Brand later told 
me he had gotten me committed to 
Porter in a desperate move to re- 
store my memory as a preliminary 
to my return to Amber. 

While Fiona and Bleys had been 
dealing with Brand, Eric had been 
in touch with Flora. She had ar- 
ranged for my transfer to Green- 
wood from the clinic to which the 

the hand of oberon 



police had taken me, with in- 
structions to keep me narcotized, 
while Eric began arrangements for 
his coronation in Amber. Shortly 
thereafter, our brother Random’s 
idyllic existence in Texorami was 
broken when Brand managed to 
send him a message outside the 
normal family channels — i.e . , the 
Trumps — requesting deliverance. 
While Random, who was blissfully 
non-partisan in the power struggle, 
was about this business, I managed 
to deliver myself from Greenwood, 
still relatively unmemoried. Having 
obtained Flora’s address from 
Greenwood’s frightened director, I 
betook myself to her place in 
Westchester, engaged in some 
elaborate bluffing and moved in as 
a house guest. Random, in the 
meantime, had been less than 
successful in his attempt to rescue 
Brand. Slaying the snakey warden 
of the tower, he had had to flee its 
inner guards, utilizing one of the 
region’s strangely mobile rocks. 
The guards, a hardy band of not 
quite human guys, had succeeded in 
pursuing him through Shadow, 
however, a feat normally impossible 
for most non-Amberites. Random 
had fled then to the shadow Earth 
where I was guiding Flora along the 
paths of misunderstanding while 
attempting to locate the proper route 
to enlightenment as to my own 
circumstances. Crossing the con- 
tinent in response to my assurance 
that he would be under my pro- 
tection, Random had come believ- 
ing that his pursuers were my own 
creatures. When I helped him de- 
stroy them he was puzzled but 
unwilling to raise the issue while 
believing that I was engaged in 



17 




some major maneuver thronewards. 
In fact, he had easily been tricked 
into conveying me back to Amber 
through Shadow. 

This venture had proved benefi- 
cial in some respects while much 
less satisfactory in others. When 1 
had finally revealed the true state of 
my personal situation, Random and 
our sister Deirdre, whom we had 
encountered along the way, con- 
ducted me to Amber’s mirror-city 
within the sea, Rebma. There I had 
walked the image of the Pattern and 
recovered the bulk of my memories 
as a result — thereby also settling the 
issue as to whether I was the real 
Corwin or merely one of his 
shadows. From Rebma I had 
traveled into Amber, utilizing the 
power of the Pattern to effect an 
instantaneous Journey home. After 
fighting an inconclusive duel with 
Eric, I had fled via the Trumps into 
the keeping of my beloved brother 
and would-be assassin, Bleys. 

I joined with Bleys in an attack 
on Amber, a mismanaged affair 
which we had lost. Bleys vanished 
during the final engagement, under 
circumstances which looked likely 
to prove fatal but, the more that I 
learned and thought about it, 
probably had not. This left me to 
become Eric’s prisoner and an 
unwilling party to his coronation, 
after which he had had me blinded 
and locked away. A few years in 
the dungeons of Amber had seen a 
regeneration of my eyes, in direct 
proportion to the deterioration of 
my state of mind. It was only the 
accidental appearance of Dad’s old 
adviser Dworkin, worse off men- 
tally than myself, which had led to 
a way of escape. 

18 



After that, I set about recovering 
and I resolved to be more prudent 
the next time I went after Eric. I 
journeyed through Shadow toward 
an old land where I had once 
reigned — Avalon — with plans to 
obtain there a substance of which 1 
alone among Amberites was aware, 
a chemical unique in its ability to 
undergo detonation in Amber. En 
route, I had passed through the land 
of Lorraine, there encountering my 
old exiled Avalonian general 
Ganelon, or someone very much 
like him. I remained because of a 
wounded knight, a girl and a local 
menace peculiarly similar to a thing 
occurring in the vicinity of Amber 
herself — a growing black circle 
somehow related to the black road 
our enemies traveled, a thing for 
which I held myself partly re- 
sponsible because of a curse I had 
pronounced at the time of my 
blinding. I won the battle, lost the 
girl and traveled on to Avalon with 
Ganelon. 

The Avalon we reached, we 
quickly learned, was under the 
protection of my brother Benedict, 
who had been having troubles of his 
own with a situation possibly akin 
to the black circle/black road 
menaces. Benedict had lost his right 
arm in the final engagement, but 
had been victorious in his battle 
with the hellmaids. He had warned 
me to keep my intentions toward 
Amber and Eric pure, and had then 
allowed us the hospitality of his 
manor while he remained for a few 
days more in the field. It was at his 
place that I met Dara. 

Dara told me she was Benedict’s 
great-granddaughter, whose exis- 
tence had been kept secret from 

GALAXY 




Amber. She drew me out as far as 
she could on Amber, the Pattern, 
the Trumps and our ability to walk 
in Shadow. She was also an ex- 
tremely skilled fencer. We indulged 
in a bit of casual love-making on 
my return from a hellride to a place 
where I obtained a sufficient quan- 
tity of rough diamonds to pay for 
the things I was going to need for 
my assault on Amber. The follow- 
ing day, Ganelon and I picked up 
our supply of the necessary 
chemicals and departed for the 
shadow Earth where I had spent my 
exile, there to obtain automatic 
weapons and ammunition man- 
ufactured to my specifications. 

En route, we had some difficul- 
ties along the black road, which 
seemed to have extended its scope 
of influence among the worlds of 
Shadow. We were equal to the 



troubles it presented, but I almost 
perished in a duel with Benedict, 
who had pursued us through a wild 
hellride. Too angry for argument, 
he had fought me through a small 
wood — still a better man than I, 
even wielding his blade left-handed. 

I had only managed to best him by 
means of a trick involving a prop- 
erty of the black road of which he 
was unaware. I had been convinced 
that he wanted my blood because of 
the affair with Dara. But no. In the 
few words that passed between us 
he denied any knowledge of the 
existence of such a person. Instead, 
he had come after us convinced that 
I had murdered his servants. 

Now, Ganelon had indeed located 
some fresh corpses in the wood at 
Benedict’s place, but we had agreed 
to forget about them, having no 
idea as to their identities and no de-

sire to complicate our existence any 
further. 

Leaving Benedict in the care of 
brother Gerard, whom 1 had 
summoned via his Trump from 
Amber, Ganelon and I proceeded to 
the shadow Earth, armed ourselves, 
recruited ^a strike force in Shadow 
and headed off to attack Amber. 
But upon our arrival we discovered 
that Amber was already under at- 
tack by creatures which had come 
in along the black road. My new 
weapons quickly turned the tide in 
Amber’s favor, and my brother Eric 
died in that battle, leaving me his 
problems, his ill will and the Jewel 
of Judgment — a weather-controlling 
weapon he had used against me 
when Bleys and 1 had attacked 
Amber. 

At that point, Dara showed up, 
swept on by us, rode into Amber, 
found her way to the Pattern and 
proceeded to walk it — prima facie 
evidence that we were indeed 
somehow related. During the course 
of this ordeal, however, she had 
exhibited what appeared to be 
peculiar physical transformations. 
Upon completion of the Pattern, she 
announced that Amber would be 
destroyed. Then she had vanished. 

About a week later, brother Caine 
was murdered, under conditions 
arranged to show me as the culprit. 
The fact that I had slain his slayer 
was hardly satisfactory evidence of 
my innocence, in that the guy was 
necessarily in no condition to talk 
about it. Realizing, however, that I 
had seen his like before, in the 
persons of those creatures who had 
pursued Random into Flora’s home, I 
finally found time to sit down with 
Random and hear the story of his 

20 



unsuccessful attempt to rescue 
Brand from his tower. 

Random, subsequent to my leav- 
ing him in Rebma years before, 
when I had journeyed to Amber to 
fight my duel with Eric, had been 
forced by Rebma’s queen. Moire, to 
marry a woman of her court: Vialle, 
a lovely blind girl. This was partly 
intended as a punishment for 
Random, who years before had left 
Moire’s late daughter Morganthe 
pregnant with Martin, the apparent 
subject of the damaged Trump 
Random now held in his hands. 
Strangely, for Random, he appeared 
to have fallen in love with Vialle, 
and he now resided with her in 
Amber. 

After I left Random, I fetched the 
Jewel of Judgment and took it down 
to the chamber of the Pattern. 
There, I followed the partial in- 
structions I had received for pur- 
poses of attuning it to my use. I 
underwent some unusual sensations 
during the process and was suc- 
cessful in obtaining control of its 
most obvious function: the ability to 
direct meteorological phenomena. 
After that, I questioned Flora 
concerning my exile. Her story 
seemed reasonable and jibed with 
those facts I did possess, although I 
had the feeling she was holding 
back somewhat on events at the 
time of my accident. She did 
promise to identify Caine’s slayer as 
one of the same sort as those in- 
dividuals Random and I had fought 
at her home in Westchester, 
however, and she assured me of her 
support in anything 1 might cur- 
rently be about. 

At the time I had heard Ran- 
dom’s story, I was still unaware of 

GALAXY 




the two factions and their machi- 
nations. I decided then that if Brand 
were still living, his rescue was of 
first importance, if for no other 
reason than the fact that he obvi- 
ously possessed information that 
someone did not want circulated. I 
hit on a scheme for achieving this, 
the trial of which was only post- 
poned for the time required by 
Gerard and myself for returning 
Caine’s body to Amber. Part of this 
time, however, was appropriated by 
Gerard for purposes of beating me 
unconscious, just in case 1 had 
forgotten he was capable of the 
feat, to add weight to his words 
when he informed me that he would 
personally kill me should it turn out 
that 1 was the author of Amber’s 
present woes. It was the most 
exclusive closed circuit fight 1 knew 
of, viewed by the family via 
Gerard’s Trump — an act of insur- 
ance should I actually be the culprit 
and have a mind to erase his name 
from the list of the living because 
of his threat. We journeyed on to 
the Grove of the Unicom then and 
exhumed Caine. At that time, we 
actually caught a brief glimpse of 
the legendary unicorn of Amber. 

That evening we met in the li- 
brary of the palace in Amber — we 
being Random, Gerard, Benedict, 
Julian, Deirdre, Fiona, Flora, 
Llewella and myself. There, we 
tested my idea for finding Brand. It 
amounted to all nine of us simul- 
taneously attempting to reach him 
via his Trump. And we succeeded. 

We contacted him and were 
successful in transporting him back 
to Amber. In the midst of the ex- 
citement, however, with all of us 
crowded about as Gerard bore him 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



through, someone planted a dagger 
in his side. Gerard immediately 
elected himself attending physician 
and cleared the room. 

The rest of us moved to a 
downstairs sitting room, there to 
backbite and discuss events. During 
this time, Fiona advised me that the 
Jewel of Judgment might represent 
a hazard in situations of prolonged 
exposure, suggesting the possibility 
that it, rather than his wounds, 
might have been the cause of Eric’s 
death. One of the first signs, she 
believed, was a distortion of one’s 
time-sense — an apparent slowdown 
of temporal sequence, actually 
representing a speedup of phy- 
siological events. 1 resolved to 
be more cautious with it, in that she 
was more conversant with these 
matters than the rest of us, having 
once been an advanced pupil of 
Dworkin’s. 

And perhaps she was correct. 
Perhaps there was such an effect in 
operation later that evening when I 
returned to my own quarters. At 
least, it seemed as if the person 
who attempted to kill me was 
moving a trifle more slowly than 1 
would have myself under similar 
circumstances. At that, the stroke 
was almost successful. The blade 
caught me in the side and the world 
went away. 

Leaking life, I awoke in my old 
bed in my old home on the shadow 
Earth where I had dwelled for so 
long as Carl Corey. How I had been 
returned, I had no idea. I crawled 
outside and into a blizzard. Clinging 
precariously to consciousness, I 
cached the Jewel of Judgment in my 
old compost heap, for the world did 
indeed seem to be slowing down 

21 




about me. Then I made it to the 
road, to try flagging down a passing 
motorist. 

It was a friend and former 
neighbor, Bill Roth, who found me 
there and drove me to the nearest 
clinic. There, I was treated by the 
same doctor who had attended me 
years before, at the time of my 
accident. He suspected I might be a- 
psychiatric case, as the old record 
did reflect that faked state of af- 
fairs. 

Bill showed up later, however, 
and set a number of things right. 
An attorney, he had grown curious 
at the time of my disappearance and 
done some investigating. He had 
learned about my fake certification 
and my successive escapes. He even 
possessed details on these matters 
and on the accident itself. He still 
felt there was something strange 
about me, but it did not really 
bother him that much. 

Later, Random contacted me via 
my Trump and advised me that 
Brand had come around and was 
asking for me. With Random’s 
assistance, I returned to Amber. I 
went to see Brand. It was then that 
I learned of the nature of the power 
struggle which had been going on 
about me, and the identities of the 
participants. His story, together 
with what Bill had told me back on 
the shadow Earth, finally brought 
some sense and coherence to oc- 
currences of the past several years. 
He also told me more concerning 
the nature of the danger we cur- 
rently faced. 

I did nothing the following day, 
ostensibly for purposes of preparing 
myself for a visit to Tir-na Nog’th, 
actually to buy additional time in 

22 



which to recover from my injury. 
This commitment made, however, it 
had to be kept. I did journey to the 
city ill the sky that night, encoun- 
tering a confusing collection of 
signs and portents, signifying 
perhaps nothing, and collecting a 
peculiar mechanical arm from the 
ghost of my brother Benedict while 
I was about it. 

Returned from this excursion on 
high, I breakfasted with Random 
and Ganelon before setting out 
across Kolvir to return home. 
Slowly, bewilderingly, the trail 
began to change about us. It was as 
though we were walking in 
Shadow, a well-nigh impossible feat 
this near to Amber. When we 
reached this conclusion, we tried to 
alter our course, but neither Ran- 
dom nor I were able to affect the 
changing scene. About that time, 
the unicorn put in an appearance. It 
seemed to want us to follow it. We 
did. 

It had led us through a 
kaleidoscopic series of changes, 
until finally we arrived at this place, 
where it abandoned us to our pre- 
sent devices. Now, with this entire 
sequence of events tumbling 
through my head, my mind moved 
about the peripheries, pushed its 
way forward, returned to the words 
Random had just spoken. I felt that 
I was slightly ahead of him once 
more. For how long this state of 
affairs might last, I did not know, 
but I realized where I had seen 
work by the same hand which had 
executed the pierced Trump. 

Brand had often painted when he 
was entering one of his melancholy 
periods, and his favorite techniques 
came to mind as I recalled canvas 



GALAXY 




after canvas he had brightened or 
darkened. Add to this his campaign 
of years before to obtain recol- 
lections and descriptions from 
everyone who had known Martin. 
While Random had not recognized 
his style, I wondered how long it 
might be before he began thinldng 
as I just had concerning the possible 
ends of Brand’s information 
gathering. Even if his hand had not 
actually propelled the blade, Brand 
was party to the act by providing 
the means. I knew Random well 
enough to know that he meant what 
he had said. He would try to kill 
Brand as soon as he saw the 
connection. This was going to be 
more than awkward. 

It had nothing to do with the fact 
that Brand had probably saved my 
life. I figured I had squared ac- 
counts with him by getting him out 
of that damned tower. No. It was 
neither indebtedness nor sentiment 
that caused me to cast about for 
ways to mislead Random or slow 
him down. It was the naked, frigid 
fact that I needed Brand. He had 
seen to that. My reason for saving 
him was no more altruistic than his 
had been in dragging me out of the 
lake. He possessed something 1 
needed now; information. He had 
realized this immediately and he 
was rationing it — his life’s union 
dues. 

“I do see the resemblance,” I 
said to Random, ‘‘and you may 
well be right about what hap- 
pened.” 

‘‘Of course I am right.” 

‘‘It is the card that was pierced,” 
I said. 

‘‘Obviously. I don’t — ” 

‘‘He was not brought through on 

the hand of OBERON 



the Trump, then. The person who 
did it therefore made contact, but 
was unable to persuade him to come 
across.” 

‘‘So? The contact had progressed 
to a point of sufficient solidity and 
proximity that he was able to stab 
him anyway. He was probably even 
able to achieve a mental lock and 
hold him where he was while he 
bled. The kid probably hadn’t had 
much experience with the Trumps.” 

‘‘Maybe yes, maybe no,” I said. 
‘‘Llewella or Moire might be able 
to tell us how much he knew about 
the Trumps. But what 1 was getting 
at was the possibility that contact 
could have been broken before 
death. If he inherited your re- 
generative abilities he might have 
survived.” 

‘‘Might have? I don’t want 
guesses! I want answers!” 

I commenced a balancing act 
within my mind. I believed I knew 
something that he did not, but then 
my source was not the best. Also, I 
wanted to keep quiet about the 
possibility because 1 had not had a 
chance to discuss it with Benedict. 
On the other hSnd, Martin was 
Random’s son, and I did want to 
direct his attention away from 
Brand. 

‘‘Random, I may have some- 
thing,” I said. 

‘‘What?” 

‘‘Right after Brand was stabbed,” 
I said, ‘‘when we were talking 
together in the sitting room, do you 
remember when the conversation 
turned to the subject of Martin?” 

‘‘Yes. Nothing new came up.” 

‘‘I had something I might have 
added at that time, but I restrained 
myself because everyone was there. 



23 




Also, because I wanted to pursue it 
in private with the party con- 
cerned.” 

“Who?” 

“Benedict.” 

“Benedict? What has he to do 
with Martin?” 

“I do not know. That is why I 
wanted to keep it quiet until I found 
out. And my source of information 
was a touchy one, at that.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Dara. Benedict gets mad as hell 
whenever I mention her name, but 
so far a number of things she told 
me have proved correct — things like 
the journey of Julian and Gerard 
along the black road, their injury, 
their stay in Avalon. Benedict 
admitted these things had hap- 
pened.” 

“What did she say about Mar- 
tin?” 

Indeed. How to phrase it without 
giving away the show on 
Brand. ? Dara had said that 
Brand had visited Benedict a 
number of times in Avalon, over a 
span of years. The time differential 
between Amber and Avalon is such 
that it seemed likely, now that I 
thought about it, that the visits fell 
into the period when Brand was so 
actively seeking information on 
Martin. I had wondered what kept 
drawing him back there, since he 
and Benedict had never been 
especially chummy. 

“Only that Benedict had had a 
visitor named Martin, whom she 
thought was from Amber,” I lied. 

“When?” 

“Some while back. I’m not 
sure. ’ ’ 

“Why didn’t you tell me this 
before?” 

24 



“It is not really very much — and 
besides, you had never seemed 
especially interested in Martin.” 

He shifted his gaze to the griffin, 
crouched and gurgling on my right, 
then nodded. 

“I am now,” he said. “Things 
change. If he is still alive, I would 
like to get to know him. If he is 
not . .” 

“Okay,” I said. “The best way 
to be about either one is to start 
figuring a way to get home. I be- 
lieve we have seen what we were 
supposed to see and I would like to 
clear out. ’ ’ 

“I was thinking about that,” he 
said, “and it occurred to me that 
we could probably use this Pattern 
for that purpose. Just head out to 
the center and transfer back.” 

“Going in along the dark area?” 
I asked. 

“Why not? Ganelon has already 
tried it and he’s okay.” 

“A moment,” said Ganelon. “I 
did not say that it was easy, and I 
am positive you could not get the 
horses to go that route.” 

“What do you mean?” I said. 

“Do you remember that place 
where we crossed the black road — 
back when we were fleeing Av- 
alon?” 

“Of course.” 

• “Well, the sensations I . ex- 
perienced in retrieving the card and 
the dagger were not unlike the upset 
that came over us at that time. It is 
one of the reasons I was running so 
fast. I would favor trying the 
Trumps again first, under the theory 
that this point is congruent with 
Amber. ’ ’ 

I nodded. 

“All right. We might as well try 
GALAXY 




making it as easy as we can. Let’s 
collect the horses first. ’ ’ 

We did this, learning the length 
of the griffin’s leash while we were 
about it. He was drawn up short 
about thirty meters from the 
cavemouth, and immediately set up 
a bleating complaint. This did not 
make the job of pacifying the horses 
any easier, but it did give rise to a 
peculiar notion which I decided to 
keep to myself. 

Once we had things under con- 
trol, Random located his Trumps 
and I brought out my own. 

“Let’s try for Benedict,’’ he 
said. 

“All right. Any time now.’’ 

I noticed immediately that the 
cards felt cold again, a good sign. I 
shuffled out Benedict’s and began 
the preliminaries. Beside me. Ran- 
dom did the same. 

Contact came almost at once. 

“What is the occasion?’’ Be- 
nedict asked, his eyes moving over 
Random, Ganelon and the horses, 
then meeting with my own. 

“Will you bring us through?’’ I 
said. 

“Horses, too?’’ 

“The works.” 

“Come ahead.” 

He extended his hand and I 
touched it. We all moved toward 
him. Moments later, we stood with 
him in a high, rocky place, a chill 
wind ruffling our garments, the sun 
of Amber past midday in a sky full 
of clouds. Benedict wore a stiff 
leather jacket and buckskin leg- 
gings. His shirt was a faded yellow. 
An orange cloak concealed the 
stump of his right arm. He tight- 
ened his long jaw and peered down 
nt me. 

the hand of oberon 



“Interesting spot you hie from,” 
he said. “I glimpsed something of 
the background.” 

I nodded. 

“Interesting view from this 
height, also,” I said, noting the 
spyglass at his belt at the same time 
that I realized we stood on the wide 
ledge of rock from which Eric had 
commanded battle on the day of his 
death and my return. I moved to 
regard the dark swath through 
Garnath, far below and stretching 
off to the horizon. 

“Yes,” he said. “The black road 
appears to have stabilized its 
boundaries at most points. At a few 
others though, it is still widening. It 
is almost as if it is nearing a final 
conformity with some — pattern. 
— Now tell me, from what point 
have you journeyed?” 

“I spent last night in Tir-na 
Nog’th,” I said, “and this morning 
we went astray in crossing Kolvir.” 
“Not an easy thing to do,” he 
said. “Getting lost on your own 
mountain. You keep heading east, 
you know. That is the direction 
froni which the sun has been known 
to take its course.” 

I felt my face flush. 

“There was an accident,” I said, 
looking away. “We lost a horse.” 
“What sort of accident?” 

“A serious one — for the horse.” 
“Benedict,” said Random, 
suddenly looking up from what I 
realized to be the pierced Trump, 
“what can you tell me concerning 
my son Martin?” 

Benedict studied him for several 
long moments before he spoke. 
Then, “Why the sudden interest?” 
he asked. 

“Because I have reason to be- 

25 




lieve he may be dead,” he said. “If 
that is the case, I want to avenge it. 
If it is not the case — Well, the 
thought that it might be has caused 
me some upset. If he is still living, 
I would like to meet him and talk 
with him.” 

“What makes you think he might 
be dead?” 

Random glanced at me. I nodded. 

“Start with breakfast,” I said. 

“While he is doing that. I’ll find 
us lunch,” said Ganelon, rummag- 
ing in one of the bags. 

‘‘The unicorn showed us the 
way ...” Random began. 



III. 

SAT IN SILENCE. Random had 
finished speaking and Benedict was 
staring skywards over Garnath. His 
face betrayed nothing. I had long 
ago learned to respect his silence. 

At length, he nodded, once, 
sharply, and turned to regard 
Random. 

“I have long suspected something 
of this order,” he stated, “from 
things that Dad and Dworkin let fall 
over the years. I had the impression 
there was a primal Pattern which 
they had either located or created, 
situating our Amber but a shadow 
away to draw upon its forces. I 
never obtained any notion as to how 
one might travel to that place, 
however.” He turned back toward 
Garnath, gesturing with his chin. 
“And that, you tell me, corresponds 
to what was done there?” 

“It seems to,” Random replied. 

“ — Brought about by the shed- 
ding of Martin’s blood?” 

“1 think so.” 

26 



Benedict raised the Trump Ran- 
dom had passed him during his 
narration. At that time, Benedict 
had made no comment. 

“Yes,” he said now, “this is 
Martin. He came to me after he 
departed Rebma. He stayed with me 
a long while.” 

“Why did he go to you?” Ran- 
dom asked. 

Benedict smiled faintly. 

“He had to go somewhere, you 
know,” he said. “He was sick of 
his position in Rebma, ambivalent 
toward Amber, young, free and just 
come into his power through the 
Pattern. He wanted to get away, see 
new things, travel in Shadow — as 
we all did. I had taken him to 
Avalon once when he was a small 
boy, to let him walk on dry land of 
a summer, to teach him to ride a 
horse and have him see a crop 
harvested. When he was suddenly 
in a position to go anywhere he 
would in an instant, his choices 
were still restricted to the few 
places of which he had knowledge. 
True, he might have dreamed up a 
place in that instant and gone 
there — creating it, as it were. But 
he was also aware that he still had 
many things to learn, to insure his 
safety in Shadow. So he elected to 
come to me, to ask me to teach 
him. And I did. He spent the better 
part of a year at my place. I taught 
him to fight, taught him of the ways 
of the Trumps and of Shadow, 
instructed him in those things an 
Amberite must know if he is to 
survive.” 

“Why did you do all these 
things?” Random asked. 

“Someone had to. It was me that 
he came to, so it was mine to do,” 

GALAXY 




Benedict replied. “It was not as if I 
were not very fond of the boy, 
though,” he added. 

Random nodded. 

“You say that he was with you 
for almost a year. What became of 
him after that?” 

“That wanderlust you know as 
well as I. Once he had obtained 
some confidence in his abilities, he 
wanted to exercise them. In the 
course of instructing him, I had 
taken him on journeys in Shadow 
myself, had introduced him to 
people of my aquaintance at various 
laces. But there came a time when 
e wanted to make his own way. 
One day then, he bade me good-bye 
and fared forth.” 

“Have you seen him since?” 
Random asked. 

“Yes. He returned periodically, 
staying with me for a time, to tell 
me of his adventures, his dis- 
coveries. It was always clear that it 
was just a visit. After a time, he 
would get restless and depart 
again.” 

“When was the last time you saw 
him?” 

“Several years ago, Avalon time, 
under the usual circumstances. He 
showed up one morning, stayed for 
perhaps two weeks, told me of the 
things he had seen and done, talked 
of the many things he wanted to do. 
Later, he set off once more.” 

“And you never heard from him 
again?” 

“On the contrary. There were 
messages left with mutual friends 
when he would pass their way. 
Occasionally, he would even con- 
tact me via my Trump — ” 

“He had a set of the Trumps?” I 
broke in. 



“Yes, I made him a gift of one 
of my extra decks.” 

“Did you have a Trump for 
him?” 

He shook his head. 

“I was not even aware that such 
a Trump existed, until I saw this 
one,” he said, raising the card, 
glancing at it and passing it back to 
Random. “I haven’t the art to 
prepare one. Random, have you 
tried reaching him with this 
Trump?” 

“Yes, any number of times since 
we came across it. Just a few 
minutes ago, as a matter of fact. 
Nothing.” 

“Of course that proves nothing. 
If everything occurred as you 
guessed and he did survive it, he 
may have resolved to block any 
future attempts at contact. He does 
know how to do that.” 

“Did it occur as I guessed? Do 
you know more about it?” 

“I have an idea,” Benedict said. 
“You see, he did show up injured 
at a friend’s place — off in 
Shadow — some years ago. It was a 
body wound, caused by the thrust 
of a blade. They said he came to 
them in very bad shape and did not 
go into details as to what had oc- 
curred. He remained for a few 
days — until he was able to get 
around again — and departed before 
he was really fully recovered. That 
was the last they heard of him. The 
last that I did, also.” 

“Weren’t you curious?” Random 
asked. “Didn’t you go looking for 
him?” 

“Of course I was curious. I still 
am. But a man should have the 
right to lead his own life without 
the meddling of relatives, no matter 



THE HAND OF OBERON

how well-intentioned. He had pulled 
through the crisis and he did not 
attempt to contact me. He appar- 
ently knew what he wanted to do. 
He did leave a message for me with 
the Tecys, saying that when I 
learned of what had happened I was 
not to worry, that he knew what he 
was about.” 

‘The Tecys?” I said. 

‘‘That’s right. Friends of mine 
off in Shadow.” 

I refrained from saying the things 
that 1 might. 1 had thought them 
just another part of Dara’s story, for 
she had so twisted the truth in other 
areas. She had mentioned the Tecys 
to me as if she knew them, as if she 
had stayed with them — all with 
Benedict’s knowledge. The moment 
did not seem appropriate, however, 
to tell him of my previous night’s 
vision in Tir-na Nog’th and the 
things it had indicated concerning 
his relationship to the girl. I had not 
yet had sufficient time to ponder the 
matter and all that it implied. 

Random stood, paced, paused 
near the ledge, his back to us, 
fingers knotted behind him. After a 
moment, he turned and stalked 
back. 

‘‘How can we get in touch with 
the Tecys?” he asked Benedict. 

‘‘No way,” said Benedict, 
‘‘except to go and see them.” 
Random turned to me. 

‘‘Corwin, 1 need a horse. You 
say that Star’s been through a 
number of hellrides ...” 

‘‘He’s had a busy morning.” 

‘‘It wasn’t that strenuous. It was 
mostly fright, and he seems okay 
now. May I borrow him?” 

Before I could answer, he turned 
toward Benedict. 

28 



‘‘You’ll take me, won’t you?” he 
said. 

Benedict hesitated. 

“I do not know what more there 
is to learn — ” he began. 

‘‘Anything! AnytWng at all they 
might remember — possibly some- 
thing that did not really seem 
important at the time but is now, 
knowing what we know.” 

Benedict looked to me. I nodded. 
‘‘He can ride Star, if you are 
willing to take him.” 

‘‘All right,” Benedict said, get- 
ting to his feet. ‘‘I’ll fetch my 
mount.” 

He turned and headed off toward 
the place where the great striped 
beast was tethered. 

‘‘Thanks, Corwin,” Random 
said. 

‘‘I’ll let you do me a favor in 
return.” 

“What?” 

‘‘Let me borrow Martin’s 
Trump.” 

“What for?” 

“An idea just hit me. It is too 
complicated to get into if you want 
to get moving. No harm should 
come of it, though.” 

He chewed his lip. 

“Okay. I want it back when you 
are done with it.” 

“Of course.” 

“Will it help find him?” 
“Maybe.” 

He passed me the card. 

“You heading back to the palace 
now?” he asked. 

“Yes.” 

“Would you tell Vialle what has 
happened and where I have gone? 
She worries.” 

“Sure. I’ll do that.” 

“I’ll take good care of Star.” 

GALAXY 




“I know that. Good luck.” 

“Thanks.” 

* * * 

I rode Firedrake. Ganelon 
walked. He had insisted. We 
followed the route I had taken in 
pursuing Dara on the day of the 
battle. Along with recent de- 
velopments, that is probably what 
made me think of her again. I 
dusted off my feelings and 
examined them carefully. I realized 
then that despite the games she had 
played with me, the killings she had 
doubtless been privy or party to and 
her stated designs upon the realm, 1 
was still attracted to her by 
something more than curiosity. I 
was not really surprised to discover 
this. Things had looked pretty much 
the same the last time I had pulled 
a surprise inspection in the emo- 
tional barracks. I wondered then 
how much of truth there might have 
been to my final vision of the 
previous night, wherein her possible 
line of descent from Benedict had 
been stated. There was indeed a 
physical resemblance, and I was 
more than half-convinced. In the 
ghost city, of course, the shade of 
Benedict had conceded as much, 
raising his new, strange arm in her 
defense . 

“What’s funny?” Ganelon asked, 
from where he strode to my left. 

“The arm,” I said, “that came 
to me from Tir-na Nog’th — I had 
worried over some hidden import, 
some unforeseen force of destiny to 
the thing, coming as it had into our 
world from that place of mystery 
and dream. Yet it did not even last 
the day. Nothing remained when the 

the hand of OBERON 



Pattern destroyed lago. The entire 
evening’s visions came to nothing.” 

Ganelon cleared his throat. 

“Well, it wasn’t exactly the way 
you seem to think,” he said. 

“What do you mean?” 

“That arm device was not in 
lago’s saddlebag. Random stowed it 
in your bag. That’s where the food 
was, and after we had eaten he 
returned the utensiles to where they 
had been in his own bag, but not 
the arm. There was no space.” 

“Oh,” I said. “Then—” 

Ganelon nodded. 

“ — So he has it with him now,” 
he finished. 

“The arm and Benedict both. 
Damn! I’ve small liking for that 
thing. It tried to kill me. No one 
has ever been attacked in Tir-na 
Nog’th before.” 

“But Benedict, Benedict’s okay. 
He’s on our side, even if you have 
some differences at the moment. 
Right?” 

I did not answer him. 

He reached up and took fire- 
drake’s reins, drawing him to a halt. 
He stared up then, studying my 
face. 

“Corwin, what happened up 
there, anyway? What did you 
learn?” 

I hesitated. In truth, what had I 
learned in the city in the sky? No 
one was certain as to the 
mechanism behind the visions of 
Tir-na Nog’th. It could well be, as 
we have sometimes suspected, that 
the place simply served to objectify 
one’s unspoken fears and desires, 
mixing them perhaps with un- 
conscious guesswork. Sharing 
conclusions and reasonably based 
conjectures was one thing. Sus- 

29 




picions engendered by something 
unknown were likely better retained 
than given currency. Still, that arm 
was solid enough . 

“I told you,” I said, “that I had 
knocked that arm off the ghost of 
Benedict. Obviously, we were 
fighting.” 

‘‘You see it then as an omen that 
you and Benedict will eventually be 
in conflict?” 

‘‘Perhaps.” 

‘‘You were shown a reason for it, 
weren’t you?” 

‘‘Okay,” I said, finding a sigh 
without trying. ‘‘Yes. It was in- 
dicated that Dara was indeed related 
to Benedict — a thing which may 
well fje correct. It is also quite 
possible, if it is true, that he is 
unaware of it. Therefore, we keep 
quiet about it until we can verify it 
or discount it. Understood?” 

‘‘Of course. But how could this 
thing be?” 

‘‘Just as she said.” 

‘ ‘Great-granddaughter?’ ’ 

I nodded. 

‘‘By whom?” 

‘‘The hellmaid we knew only by 
reputation — Lintra, the lady who 
cost him his arm.” 

‘‘But that battle was only a recent 
thing.” 

‘‘Time flows differently in dif- 
ferent realms of Shadow, Ganelon. 
In the farther reaches — It would not 
be impossible.” 

He shook his head and relaxed 
his grip on the reins. 

‘‘Corwin, I really think Benedict 
should know about this,” he said. 
‘‘If it is true, you ought to give him 
a chance to prepare himself rather 
than let him discover it of a sudden. 
You people are such an infertile lot 

30 



that paternity seems to hit you had- 
er than it does others. Look at 
Random. For years, he had dis- 
owned his son, and now — I’ve a 
feeling he’d risk his life for him.” 
‘‘So do I,” I said. ‘‘Now forget 
the first part but carry the second 
one a step further in the case of 
Benedict.” 

‘‘You think he would take Dara’s 
side against Amber?” 

‘‘I would rather avoid presenting 
him with the choice by not letting 
him know that it exists — if it 
exists.” 

‘‘I think you do him a disservice. 
He is hardly an emotional infant. 
Get hold of him on the Trump and 
tell him your suspicions. That way, 
at least, he can be thinking about it, 
rather than have him risk some 
sudden confrontation unprepared.” 
‘‘He would not believe me. You 
have seen how he gets whenever I 
mention Data.” 

‘‘That in itself may say some- 
thing. Possibly he suspects what 
might have happened and rejects it 
so vehemently because he would 
have it otherwise.” 

‘‘Right now it would just widen a 
rift I am trying to heal.” 

‘‘Your holding back on him now 
may serve to rupture it completely 
when he finds out.” 

‘‘No. I believe I know my 
brother better than you do.” 

He released the reins. 

‘‘Very well,” he said. ‘‘I hope 
you are right.” 

I did not answer, but started 
Firedrake to moving once more. 
There was an unspoken under- 
standing between us that Ganelon 
could ask me anything he wanted, 
and it also went without saying that 

GALAXY 




I would listen to any advice he had 
to offer me. This was partly be- 
cause his position was unique. We 
were not related. He was no 
Amberite. The struggles and 
problems of -Amber were his only 
by choice. We had been friends and 
then enemies long ago, and finally, 
more recently, friends again and 
allies in a battle in his adopted land. 
That matter concluded, he had 
asked to come with me, to help me 
deal with my own affairs and those 
of Amber. As I saw it, he owed me 
nothing now, nor I him— if one 
keeps a scoreboard tally on Such 
matters. Therefore, it was friendship 
alone that bound us, a stronger 
thing than bygone debts and points 
of honor: in other words, a thing 
which gave him the right to bug me 
on matters such as this, where I 
might have told even Random to go 
to hell once I had made up my 
mind. I realized I should not be 
irritated when everything that he 
said was tendered in good faith. 
Most likely it was an old military 
feeling, going back to our earliest 
relationship as well as being tied in 
with the present state of affairs: I do 
not like having my decisions and 
orders questioned. Probably, I 
decided, I was irritated even more 
by the fact that he had made some 
shrewd guesses of late, and some 
fairly sound suggestions based upon 
them — things I felt I ought to have 
caught myself. No one likes to 
admit to a resentment based on 
something like that. Still . Was 
that all? A simple projection of 
dissatisfaction over a few instances 
of personal inadequacy? An old 
Army reflex as to the sanctity of my 
'Jccisions? Or was it something

deeper that had been bothering me 
and was just now coming to the 
surface? 

“Corwin,” Ganelon said, “I’ve 
been doing some thinking ...” 

I sighed. 

“Yes?” 

“. about Random’s son. The 
way your crowd heals, I suppose it 
is possible that he might have 
survived and still be about.” 

“I would like to think so.” 

“Do not be too hasty.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I gather he had very little 
contact with Amber and the rest of 
the family, growing up in Rebma 
the way that he did. 

“That is the way I understand it, 
too.” 

“In fact, outside of Benedict — 
and Llewella, back in Rebma — the 
only other one he apparently had 
contact with would have been the 
one who stabbed him — Bleys, 
Brand or Fiona. It has occurred to 
me that he probably has a pretty 
distorted view of the family.” 
“Distorted,” I said, “but maybe 
not unwarranted, if I see what you 
are getting at.” 

“I thii^ you do. It seems con- 
ceivable that he is not only afraid of 
the family, but may have it in for 
the lot of you.” 

“It is possible,” I said. 

“Do you think he could have 
thrown in with the enemy?” 

I shook my head. 

“Not if he knows they are the 
tools of the crowd that tried to kill 
him.” 

“But are they? I wonder. ? 
You say Brand got scared and tried 
to back out of whatever arrange- 
ment they had with the black road 

31 




gang. If they are that strong, I 
wonder whether Fiona and Bleys 
might not have become their tools? 
If this were the case, I could see 
Martin angling for something which 
gave him power over them.” 

‘‘Too elaborate a structure of 
guesses,” I said. 

‘‘The enemy seems to know a lot 
about you.” 

‘‘True, but they had a couple 
traitors to give them lessons.” 

‘‘Could they have given them 
everything you say Dara knew?” 

‘‘That is a good point,” I said, 
‘‘but it is hard to say.” Except for 
the business about the Tecys 
which occurred to me immediately. 
I decided to keep that to myself for 
the moment though, to find out 
what he was leading up to, rather 
than going off on a tangent. So, 
‘‘Martin was hardly in a position to 
tell them much about Amber,” I 
said. 

Ganelon was silent for a moment. 
Then, ‘‘Have you had a chance to 
check on the business I asked you 
about that night at your tomb?” he 
said. 

‘‘What business?” 

‘‘Whether the Trumps could be 
bugged,” he said. ‘‘Now that we 
know Martin had a deck ...” 

It was my turn to be silent while 
a small family of moments crossed 
my path, single file, from the left, 
sticlung their tongues out at me. 

‘‘No,” I said then. ‘‘I haven’t 
had a chance.” 

We proceeded on for quite a 
distance before he said, ‘‘Corwin, 
the night you brought Brand 
back. ?” 

“Yes?” 

‘‘You say you accounted for 



everyone later, in trying to figure 
out who it was that stabbled you, 
and that any of them would have 
been hard put to pull the stunt in 
the time involved.” 

‘‘Oh,” I said, ‘‘and oh.” 

He nodded. 

‘‘Now you have another relative 
to think about. He may lack the 
family finesse only because he is 
young and unpracticed.” 

Sitting there in my mind, I 
gestured back at the silent parade of 
moments that crossed between 
Amber and then. 



IV. 

She asked who it was when I 
knocked and I told her. 

‘‘Just a moment.” 

I heard her footsteps and then the 
door swung in. Vialle is only a lit- 
tle over five feet tall and quite slim. 
Brunette, fine-featured, very 
softspoken. She was wearing red 
Her sightless eyes looked througl 
me, reminding me of darkness past 
of pain. 

“Random,” I said, “asked me tc 
tell you that he would be delayed a 
little longer, but that there was 
nothing to worry about. ’ ’ 

“Please come in,” she said^ 
stepping aside and drawing the doo^ 
the rest of the way open. 1 

I did. I did not want to, but ] 
did. I had not intended to takfl 
Random’s request literally — that 1 
tell her what had happened and 
where he had gone. I had meant 
simply to tell her what I had already 
said, nothing more. It was not until 
we had ridden our separate ways 
that I realized exactly what 

r^Ai AxV 



32 





Random’s request had amounted to: 
He had just asked me to go tell his 
wife, to whom I had never spoken 
more than half a dozen words, that 
he had taken off to go looking for 
his illegitimate son — the lad whose 
mother, Morganthe, had committed 
suicide, a thing for which Random 
had been punished by being forced 
to marry Vialle. The fact that the 
marriage had somehow worked 
beautifully was something which 
still amazed me. I had no desire to 
dispense a load of awkward tidings, 
and as I moved into the room I 
sought alternatives. 

I passed a bust of Random set on 
a high shelf on the wall to my left. 
1 had actually gone by before it 
registered that my brother was in- 
deed the subject. Across the room, I 
saw her workbench. Turning back, I 
studied the bust. 

“I did not realize that you 
sculpted,” I said. 

“Yes.” 

Casting my gaze about the 
apartment, I quickly located other 
examples of her work. 

‘‘Quite good,” I said. 

‘‘Thank you. Won’t you sit 
down?” 

I lowered myself into a large, 
high-armed chair which proved 
more comfortable than it had 
looked. She seated herself on a low 
divan to my right, curling her legs 
beneath her. 

“May I get you something to eat, 
or to drink?” 

“No thanks. I can only stay a 
short while. What it is, is that 
Random, Ganelon and I had gotten 
a bit sidetracked on the way home, 
and after that delay we met with 
Benedict for a time. The upshot of 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



33 




it was that Random and Benedict 
had to make another small jour- 
ney. ’ ’ 

“How long will he be away?” 

“Probably overnight. Maybe a bit 
longer. If it is going to be much 
longer he will probably call back on 
someone’s Trump, and we’ll let you 
know.” 

My side began to throb and I 
rested my hand upon it, massaging 
it gently. 

“Random has told me many 
things about you,” she said. 

I chuckled. 

“Are you certain you would not 
care for something to eat? It would 
be no trouble.” 

“Did he tell you that I am always 
hungry?” 

She laughed. 

“No. But if you have been as 
active as you say, I would guess 
that you did not take time for 
lunch.” 

“In that you would be only half- 
correct. All right. If you’ve a spare 
piece of bread lying about it might 
do me some good to gnaw on it.” 

“Fine. Just a moment.” 

She rose and departed into the 
next room. I took the opportunity to 
scratch heartily all about my wound 
where it was suddenly itching fit to 
kill. I had accepted her hospitality 
partly for this reason and partly 
because of the realization that I 
actually was hungry. Only a little 
later it struck me that she could not 
have seen me attacking my side as I 
was. Her sure movements, her 
confident manner had relaxed my 
awareness of her blindness. Good. 
It pleased me that she was able to 
carry it so well. 

I heard her humming a tune; 

34 



“The Ballad of the Water Cros- 
sers,” the song of Amber’s great 
merchant navy. Amber is not notedj 
for manufacture, and agriculture has 
never been our forte. But our ships 
sail the shadows, plying between: 
anywhere and anywhere, dealing in 
anything. Just about every male 
Amberite, noble or otherwise, 
spends some time in the fleet. 
Those of the blood laid down the 
trade routes long ago that other 
vessels might follow, the seas of a 
double dozen worlds in every 
captain’s head. I had assisted in this 
in times gone by, and though my 
involvement had never been so deep 
as Gerard’s or Caine’s, I had been 
mightily moved by the forces of the 
deep and the spirit of the men who 
crossed it. 

After a while, Vialle came in 
bearing a tray heavy with bread, 
meat, cheese, fruit and a flask of 
wine. She set it upon a table near at 
hand. 

“You mean to feed a regiment?” 
I asked. 

“Best to be safe.” 

“Thanks. Won’t you Join me?” 

“A piece of fruit, perhaps,” she 
said. 

Her fingers sought for a second, 
located an apple. She returned to 
the divan. 

“Random tells me you wrote that 
song,” she said. 

“That was a very long time ago, 
Vialle.” 

“Have you composed any re- 
cently?” 

I began to shake my head, caught 
myself, said, “No. That part of me 
is . resting.” 

“Pity. It is lovely.” 

“Random is the real musician.” 

GALAXY 




“Yes, he is very good. But 
performance and composition are 
two different things.” 

“True. One day when things 
have eased up . Tell me, are you 
h^ppy here in Amber? Is everything 
to your liking? Is there anything 
that you need?” 

She smiled. 

“All that I need is Random. He 
is a good man.” 

1 was strangely moved to hear her 
speak of him in this fashion. 

“Then I am happy for you,” I 
said. And, “Younger, smaller 
. he might have had it a bit 
rougher than the rest of us,” I went 
on. “Nothing quite as useless as 
another prince when there is already 
a crowd of them about. I was as 
guilty as the rest. Bleys and I once 
stranded him for two days on an 
islet to the south of here ...” 

“. And Gerard went and got 
him when he learned of it,” she 
said. “Yes, he told me. It must 
bother you if you remember it after 
all this time.” 

“It must have made an impres- 
sion on him, too.” 

“No, he forgave you long ago. 
He told it as a joke. Also, he drove 
a spike through the heel of your 
boot — pierced your foot when you 
put it on.” 

“Then it was Random! I’ll be 
damned! I had always blamed Julian 
for that one.” 

“That one bothers Random.” 

“How long ago all of this 
Was . ” I said. I shook my head and 
continued eating. Hunger seized me 
and she gave me several minutes of 
silence in which to get the upper hand 
on it. When I had, I felt compelled to 
say something. 

the hand of OBERON 



“That is better. Much better,” I 
began. “It was a peculiar and trying 
night that I spent in the sky-city.” 
“Did you receive omens of a 
useful nature?” 

“I do not know how useful they 
might prove. On the other hand, I 
suppose I’d rather have had them 
than not. Have there been any in- 
teresting happenings hereabouts?” 
“A servant tells me your brother 
Brand continues to rally. He ate 
well this morning, which is en- 
couraging.” 

“True,” I said. “True. It would 
seem he is out of danger.” 

“Likely. It^ — It is a terrible 
series of happenings to which you 
have all been subjected. I am sorry. 
I was hoping you might obtain 
some indication of an upturn in 
your affairs during the night you 
spent in Tir-na Nog’th.” 

“It does not matter,” I said. “I 
am not that sure of the value of the 
thing.” 

“Then why — Oh.” 

I studied her with renewed in- 
terest. Her face still betrayed noth- 
ing, but her right hand twitched, 
tapping and plucking at the material 
of the divan. Then, as with a sud- 
den awareness of its eloquence, she 
stilled it. She was obviously a per- 
son who had answered her own 
question and wished now she had 
done it in silence. 

“Yes,” I said, “I was stalling. 
You are aware of my injury.” 

She nodded. 

“I am not angry with Random 
for having told you,” I said. “His 
judgment has always been acute and 
geared to defense. I see no reason 
not to rely on it myself. I must 
inquire as to how much he has told 

35 




you, however, both for your own 
safety and my peace of mind. For 
there are things I suspect but have 
not yet spoken.” 

“I understand. It is difficult to 
assess a negative — the things he 
might have left out, I mean — but he 
tells me most things. I know your 
story and most of the others’. He 
keeps me aware of events, suspi- 
cions, conjectures.” 

“Thank you,” I said, taking a 
sip of the wine. “It makes it easier 
for me to speak then, seeing how 
things are with you. I am going to 
tell you everything that happened 
from breakfast till now ...” 

So I did. 

She smiled occasionally as I 
spoke, but she did not interrupt. 
When I had finished, she asked, 
“You thought that mention of Mar- 
tin would upset me?” 

“It seemed possible,” I told her. 
“No,” she said. “You see, I 
knew Martin in Rebma, when he 
was but a small boy. I was there 
while he was growing up. I liked 
him then. Even if he were not 
Random’s son he would still be 
dear to me. I can only be pleased 
with Random’s concern and hope 
that it has come in time to benefit 
them both.” 

I shook my head. 

“I do not meet people like you 
too often,” I said. “I am glad that I 
finally have.” 

She laughed, then said, “You 
were without sight for a long 
while.” 

“Yes.” 

“It can embitter a person, or it 
can give him a greater joy in those 
things which he does have.” 

I did not have to think back over 

36 



my feelings from those days of 
blindness to know that I was a 
person of the first sort, even 
discounting the circumstances under 
which I had suffered it. I am sorry, 
but that is the way that I am, and i 
am sorry. 

“True,” I said. “You are for- 
tunate.” 

“It is really only a state of 
mine — a thing a Lord of Shadow 
can easily appreciate.” 

She rose. 

“I have always wondered as to 
your appearance,’’ she said. 
“Random has described you, but 
that is different. May I?” 

“Of course.” 

She approached and placed her 
fingertips upon my face. Delicately, 
she traced my features. | 

“Yes,” she said, “you are muchl 
as I had thought you would be. And! 
I feel the tension in you. It has been 
there for a long while, has it not?” 
“In some form or other, I 
suppose, ever since my return to 
Amber.” 

“I wonder,” she said, “whether 
you might have been happier before 
you regained your memory.” 

“It is one of those impossible! 
uestions,” I said. “I might also be! 
ead if I had not. But putting that 
part aside for a moment, in those 
times there was still a thing that 
drove me, that troubled me every 
day. I was constantly looking for 
ways to discover who I really was, 
what I was.” 

“But were you happier, or less 
happy, than you are now?” 

“Neither,” I said. “Things 
balance out. It is, as you suggested, 
a state of mind. And even if it were 
not so, I could never go back to

“I want to understand you,” she 
said. ‘‘Ever since I first heard of 
you back in Rebtna, even before 
Random told me stories, I wondered 
what it was that drove you. Now 
I’ve the opportunity — no right, of 
course, just the opportunity — I felt 
it worth speaking out of turn and 
order beyond my station simply to 
ask you.” 

A half-chuckle caught me. 

“Fairly taken,” 1 said. “I will 
see whether I can be honest. Hatred 
drove me at first — hatred for my 
brother Eric — and my desire for the 
throne. Had you asked me on my 
return which was the stronger, I 
would have said that it was the 
summons of the throne. Now, 
though . Now I would have to 
admit that it was actually the other 
way around. I had not realized it 
until this moment, but it is true. But 
Eric is dead and there is nothing left 
of what I felt then. The throne 
remains, but now I find that my 
feelings toward it are mixed. There 
is a possibility that none of us has a 
right to it under present cir- 
cumstances, and even if all family 
objections were removed I would 
not take it at this time. I would 
have to see stability restored to the 
realm and a number of questions 
answered first.” 



‘‘Even if these things showed that 
you may not have the throne?” 
‘‘Even so.” 

‘‘Then I begin to understand.” 
“Understand what?” 



hand of OBERON 



“Lord Corwin, my knowledge of 
the philosophical bases of these 
things is limited, but it is my un- 
derstanding that you are able to find 
anything you wish within Shadow. 
This has troubled me for a long 
while, and I never fully understood 
Random’s explanations. If you 
wished, could not each of you walk 
in Shadow and find yourself another 
Amber — like this one in all re- 
spects, save that you ruled there or 
enjoyed whatever other status you 
might desire?” 

“Yes, we could locate such 
places,” I said. 

“Then why is this not done, to 
have an end of strife?” 

“It is because a place could be 
found which seemed to be the 
same — but that would be all. We 
are a part of this Amber as surely as 
it is a part of us. Any shadow of 
Amber would have to be populated 
with shadows of ourselves to seem 
worthwhile. We could even except 
our own person should we choose 
to move into a ready realm. 
However, the shadow folk would 
not be exactly like the other people 
here. A shadow is never precisely 
like that which casts it. These little 
differences add up. They are actu- 
ally worse than major ones. It 
would amount to entering a nation 
of strangers. The best mundane 
comparison which occurs to me is 
an encounter with a person who 
strongly resembles another person 
you know. You keep expecting him 
to act like your acquaintance; worse 
yet, you have a tendency to act 
toward him as you would toward 
that other. You face him with a 
certain mask and his responses are 
not appropriate. It is an uncom- 



37 




fortable feeling. I never enjoy 
meeting people who remind me of 
other people. Personality is the one 
thing we cannot control in our 
manipulations of Shadow. In fact, it 
is the means by which we can tell 
one angther from shadows of 
themselves. This is why Rora could 
not decide about me for so long, 
back on the shadow Earth: my new 
personality was sufficiently differ- 
ent.” 

“I begin to understand,” she 
said. “It is not just Amber for you. 
It is the place plus everything 
else.” 

“The place plus everything 
else . That is Amber,” I agreed. 

“You say that your hate died 
with Eric and your desire for the 
throne has been tempered by the 
consideration of new things you 
have learned.” 

“That is so.” 

“Then I think I do understand 
what it is that moves you.” 

“The desire for stability moves 
me,” I said, “and something of 
curiosity — and revenge on our 
enemies ...” 

“Duty,” she said. “Of course.” 

I snorted. 

“It would be comforting to put 
such a face on it,” I said. “As it 
is, however, 1 will not be a 
hypocrite. I am hardly a dutiful son 
of Amber or of Oberon.” 

“Your voice makes it plain that 
you do not wish to be considered 
one.” 

I closed my eyes, closed them to 
join her in darkness, to recall for a 
brief while the world where other 
messages than light waves took 
precedence. I knew then that she 
had been right about my voice. 

38 



Why had I trodden so heavily on 
the idea of duty as soon as it was 
suggested? I like credit for being 
good and clean and noble and 
high-minded when I have it coming, 
even sometimes when I do not — the 
same as the next person. What 
bothered me about the notion of 
duty of Amber? Nothing. What was 
it then? 

Dad. 

1 no longer owed him anything, 
least of all duty. Ultimately, he was 
responsible for the present state of 
affairs. He had fathered a great 
brood of us without providing for a 
proper succession, he had been less 
than kind to all of our mothers and 
he then expected our devotion and 
support. He played favorites and, in 
fact, it even seemed he played us 
off against one another. He then got 
suckered into something he could 
not handle and left the kingdom in a 
mess. Sigmund Freud had long ago 
anesthetized me to any normal, 
generalized feelings of resentment 
which might operate within the 
family unit. I have no quarrel on 
those grounds. Facts are another 
matter. I did not dislike my father 
simply because he had given me no 
reason to like him; in truth, it 
seemed that he had labored in the 
other direction. Enough. I realized 
what it was that bothered me about 
the notion of duty: its object. 

“You are right,” I said, opening 
my eyes, regarding her, “and I am 
glad that you told me of it.” 

I rose. 

“Give me your hand,” I said. 

She extended her right hand and I 
raised it to my lips. 

“Thank you,” I said. “It was a 
good lunch.” 



GALAXY 




I turned and made my way to the 
door. When I looked back she had 
blushed and was smiling, her hand 
still partly raised, and I began to 
understand the change in Random. 

“Good luck to you,” she said, 
the moment my footsteps ceased. 

“. And you,” 1 said, and 
went out quickly. 

* ★ * 

1 had been planning to see Brand 
next, but just could not bring my- 
self to do it. For one thing, I did 
not want to encounter him with my 
wits dulled by fatigue. For another, 
talking with Vialle was the first 
pleasant thing which had happened 
to me in some time, and Just this 
once I was going to quit while I 
was ahead. 

I mounted the stair and walked 
the corridor to my room, thinking 
of course of the night of the knif- 
ings as 1 fitted my new key to my 
new lock. In my bed chamber, I 
drew the drapes against the after- 
noon’s light, undressed and got into 
bed. As on other occasions of rest 
after stress with more stress pend- 
ing, sleep eluded me for a time. For 
a long while I tossed and twisted, 
reliving events of the past several 
days and some from even farther 
back. When finally I slept, my 
dreams were an amalgam of the 
same material, including a spell in 
my old cell, scraping away at the 
door. 

It was dark when I awoke and I 
actually felt rested. The tension 
gone out of me, my reverie was 
much more peaceful. In fact, there 
was a tiny charge of pleasant ex- 
citement dancing through the back 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



of my head. It was a tip-of-the- 
tongue imperative, a buried notion 
that — 

Yes! 

I sat up. I reached for my 
clothes, began to dress. I buckled 
on Grayswandir. I folded a blanket 
and tucked it under my arm. Of 
course . 

My mind felt clear and my side 
had stopped throbbing. I had no 
idea how long I had slept, and it 
was hardly worth checking at this 
point. I had something far more 
important to look into, something 
which should have occurred to me a 
long while ago — had occurred, as a 
matter of fact. I had actually been 
staring right at it once, b.*it the 
crush of time and events had ground 
it from my mind. Until now. 

I locked my room behind me and 
headed for the stair. Candles 
flickered, and the faded stag who 
had been dying for centuries on the 
tapestry to my right looked back on 
the faded dogs who had been 
pursuing him for approximately as 
long. Sometimes my sympathies are 
with the stag; usually though, I am 
all dog. Have to have the thing 
restored one of these days. 

The stairs and down. No sounds 
from below. Late, then. Good. 
Another day and we’re still alive. 
Maybe even a trifle wiser. Wise 
enough to realize there are many 
more things we still need to know. 
Hope, though. There’s that. A thing 
I lacked when I squatted in that 
damned cell, hands pressed against 
my ruined eyes, howling. Vialle 
... I wish I could have spoken 
with you for a few moments in 
those days. But I learned what I 
learned in a nasty school, and even 

39 




a milder curriculum would probably 
not have given me your grace. 
Still . Hard to say. I have al- 
ways felt I am more dog than stag, 
more hunter than victim. You might 
have taught me something that 
would have blunted the bitterness, 
tempered the hate. But would that 
have been for the best? The hate 
died with its object and the bit- 
terness, too, has passed — but look- 
ing back, 1 wonder whether 1 would 
have made it without them to sus- 
tain me. I am not at all certain that 
1 would have survived my in- 
ternment without my ugly com- 
panions to drag me back to life and 
sanity time and again. Now I can 
afford the luxury of an occasional 
stag-thought, but then it might have 
been fatal. I do not truly know, 
kind lady, and 1 doubt that I ever 
will. 

Stillness on the second floor. A 
few noises from below. Sleep well, 
lady. Around, and down again. I 
wondered whether Random had 
uncovered anything of great 
moment. Probably not, or he or 
Benedict should have contacted me 
by now. Unless there was trouble. 
But no. It is ridiculous to shop for 
worries. The real thing makes itself 
felt in due course, and I’d more 
than enough to go around. 

The ground floor. 

“Will,” 1 said, and, “Rolf.” 

“Lord Corwin.” 

The two guards had assumed 
professional stances on hearing my 
footsteps. Their faces told me that 
all was well, but 1 asked for the 
sake of form. 

“Quiet, Lord. Quiet,” replied the 
senior. 

“Very good,” 1 said, and I 

40 



continued on, entering and crossing 
the marble dining hall. 

It would work, I was sure of that, 
if time and moisture had not totally 
effaced it. And then . 

I entered the long corridor, where 
the dusty walls pressed close on 
either side. Darkness, shadows, my 
footsteps . 

I came to the door at the end, 
opened it, stepped out onto the 
platform. Then down once more, 
that spiralling way, a light here, a 
light there, into the caverns of 
Kolvir. Random had been right, I 
decided then. If you had gouged out 
everything, down to the level of 
that distant floor, there would be a 
close correspondence between what 
was left and the place of that primal 
Pattern we had visited this morning. 

. On down. Twisting and 
winding through the gloom. The 
torch and lantern-lit guard station 
was theatrically stark within it. I 
reached the floor and headed that 
way. 

“Good evening. Lord Corwin,” 
said the lean, cadaverous figure 
who rested against a storage rack, 
smoking his pipe, grinning around 
it. 

“Good evening, Roger. How are 
things in the nether world?” 

“A rat, a bat, a spider. Nothing 
much else astir. Peaceful.” 

“You enjoy this duty?” 

He nodded. 

“I am writing a philosophical 
romance shot through with elements 
of horror and morbidity. I work on 
those parts down here.” 

“Fitting, fitting,” I said. “I’ll be 
needing a lantern.” 

He took one from the rack, 
brought it to flame from his candle. 

GALAXY 




“Will it have a happy ending?” I 

inquired. 

He shrugged. 

“I’ll be happy.” 

“I mean, does good triumph and 
hero bed heroine? Or do you kill 
everybody off?” 

“That’s hardly fair,” he said. 

“Never mind. Maybe I’ll read it 
one day.” 

“Maybe,” he said. 

I took the lantern and turned 
3 M(ay, heading in a direction I had 
not taken in a long while. I dis- 
covered that I could still measure 
the echoes in my mind. 

Before too long, I neared the 
wall, sighted the proper corridor, 
entered it. It was simply a matter of 
counting my paces then. My feet 
knew the way. 

The door to my old cell stood 
partly ajar. I set down the lantern 
and used both hands to open it ful- 
ly. It gave way grudgingly, moan- 
ing as it moved. Then I raised the 
lantern, held it high and entered. 

My flesh tingled and my stomach 
clenched itself within me. I began 
to shiver. I had to fight down a 
strong impulse to bolt and run. I 
had not anticipated such a reaction. 
I did not want to step away from 
that heavy brassbound door for fear 
that it would be slammed and bolted 
behind me. It was an instant close 
to pure terror that the small dirty 
cell had aroused in me. I forced 
•tiyself to dwell on particulars — the 
bole which had been my latrine, the 
blackened spot where I had built my 
ttre on that final day. I ran my left 
band oyer the inner surface of the 
boor, finding and tracing there the 
grooves I had worn while scraping 
away with my spoon. I remembered 

^he hand of OBERON 



what the activity had done to my 
hands. I stooped to examine the 
gouging. Not nearly so deep as it 
had seemed at the time, not when 
compared to the total thickness of 
the door. I realized how much I had 
exaggerated the effects of that fee- 
ble effort toward freedom. I stepped 
past it and regarded the wall. 

Faint. Dust and moisture had 
worked to undo it. But 1 could still 
discern the outlines of the light- 
house of Cabra, bordered by four 
slashes of my old spoon handle. 
The magic was still there, that force 
which had finally transported me to 
freedom. I felt it without calling 
upon it. 

I turned and faced the other wall. 

The sketch which I now regarded 
had fared less well than that of the 
lighthouse, but then it had been 
executed with extreme haste by the 
light of my last few matches. I 
could not even make out all of the 
details, though my memory fur- 
nished a few of those which were 
hidden: It was a view of a den or 
library, bookshelves lining the 
walls, a desk in the foreground, a 
globe beside the desk. 1 wondered 
whether I should risk wiping it 
clean. 

I set my lantern on the floor, 
returned to the sketch on the other 
wall. With a comer of my blanket, 
I gently wiped some dust from a 
oint near the base of the light- 
ouse. The line grew clearer. I 
wiped it again, exerting a little 
more pressure. Unfortunate. I de- 
stroyed an inch or so of outline. 

I stepped back and tore a wide 
strip from the edge of the blanket. I 
folded what remained into a pad 
and seated myself on it. Slowly, 



41 




carefully then, I set to work on the 
lighthouse. I had to get an exact 
feeling for the work before I tried 
cleaning the other one. 

Half an hour later I stood up and 
stretched, bent and massaged life 
back into my legs. What remained 
of the lighthouse was clean. Un- 
fortunately, I had destroyed about 
twenty percent of the sketch before 
I developed a sense of the wall’s 
texture and an appropriate stroke 
across it. I doubted that I was going 
to improve any further. 

The lantern sputtered as 1 moved 
it. 1 unfolded the blanket, shook it 
out, tore off a fresh strip. Making 
up a new pad, 1 knelt before the 
other sketch and set to work. 

Awhile later I had uncovered what 
remained of it. 1 had forgotten the 
skull on the desk until a careful 
stroke revealed it once again — and 
the angle of the far wall, and a tall 
candlestick ... I drew back. It 
would be risky to do any more 
rubbing. Probably unnecessary, 
also. It seemed about as entire as it 
had been. 

The lantern was flickering once 
again. Cursing Roger for not 
checking the kerosene level, 1 stood 
and held the light at shoulder level 
off to my left. 1 put everything from 
my mind but the scene before me. 

I gained something of perspective 
as 1 stared. A moment later and it 
was totally three-dimensional and 
had expanded to fill my entire field 
of vision. I stepped forward then 
and rested the lantern on the edge 
of the desk. 

I cast my eyes about the place. 
There were bookshelves on all four 
walls. No windows. Two doors at 
the far end of the room, right and 

42 



left, across from one another, one 
closed, the other partly ajar. There 
was a long, low table covered with 
books and papers beside the opened 
door. Bizarre curios occupied open 
spaces on the shelves and odd 
niches and recesses in the walls — 
bones, stones, pottery, inscribed 
tablets, lenses, wands, instruments 
of unknown function. The huge rug 
resembled an Ardebil. I took a step 
toward that end of the room and the 
lantern sputtered again. I turned and 
reached for it. At that moment, it 
failed. 

I growled an obscenity and 
lowered my hand. Then I turned, 
slowly, to check for any possible 
light sources. Something resembling 
a branch of coral shone faintly on a 
shelf across the room and a pale 
line of illumination occurred at the 
base of the closed door. 1 aban- 
doned the lantern and crossed the 
room. 

I opened the door as quietly as 1 
could. The room it let upon was 
deserted, a small, windowless living 
place faintly illuminated by the still 
smouldering embers in its single, 
recessed hearth. The room’s walls 
were of stone and they arched 
above me. The fireplace was a 
possibly natural niche in the wall to 
my left. A large, armored door was 
set in the far wall, a big key partly 
turned in its lock. 

I entered, taking a candle from a 
nearby table, and moved toward the 
fireplace to give it a light. As 1 
knelt and sought a flame among the 
embers, I heard a soft footfall in 
the vicinity of the doorway. 

Turning, I saw him just beyond 
the threshold. About five feet in 
height, hunchbacked. His hair and 

GALAXY 




beard were even longer than I 
remembered. Dworkin wore a 
nightshirt which reached to his 
ankles. He carried an oil lamp, his 
dark eyes peering across its sooty 
chimney. 

“Oberon,” he said, “is it finally 
time?” 

“What time is that?” 1 asked 
softly. 

He chuckled. 

“What other? Time to destroy the 
world, of course!” 

V. 

I KEPT THE LIGHT away from my 
face, kept my voice low. 

“Not quite,” I said. “Not 
quite.” 

He sighed. 

“You remain unconvinced.” 

He looked forward and cocked 
his head, peering down at me. 

“Why must you spoil things?” 
he said. 

“I’ve spoiled nothing.” 

He lowered the lamp. I turned 
my head again, but he finally got a 
good look at my face. He laughed. 

“Funny. Funny, funny, funny,” 
he said. “You come as the young 
Lord Corwin thinking to sway me 
with family sentiment. Why did you 
not choose Brand or Bleys? It was 
Clarissa’s lot served us best.” 

I shrugged and stood. 

“Yes and no,” I said, de- 
termined now to feed him am- 
biguities for so long as he’d accept 
them and respond. Something of 
value might emerge, and it seemed 
an easy way to keep him in a good 
humor. “And yourself?” I con- 
tinued. “What face would you put 
on things?” 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



“Why, to win your good will I’ll 
match you,” he said, and then he 
began to laugh. 

He threw his head back, and as 
his laughter rang about me a change 
came over him. His stature seemed 
to increase, and his face luffed like 
a sail cut too close to the wind. The 
hump on his back was diminished 
as he straightened and stood taller. 
His features rearranged themselves 
and his beard darkened. By then it 
was obvious that he was somehow 
redistributing his body mass, for the 
nighshirt which had reached his 
ankles was now midway up his 
shins. He breathed deeply and his 
shoulders widened. His arms 
lengthened, his bulging abdomen 
narrowed, tapered. He reached 
shoulder height on me, then higher. 
He looked me in the eye. His 
garment reached only to his knees. 
His hump was totally restored. His 
face gave a final twist, his features 
steadied, were reset. His laughter 
fell to a chuckle, faded, closed with 
a smirk. 

1 regarded a slightly slimmer 
version of myself. 

“Sufficient?” he inquired. 

“Not half bad,” 1 said. “Wait 
till I toss a couple logs on the fire.” 
“1 will help you.” 

“That’s all right.” 

I drew some wood from a rack to 
the right. Any stall served me 
somewhat, buying reactions for my 
study. As I was about the work, he 
crossed to a chair and seated 
himself. When I glanced at him 1 
saw that he was not looking at me, 
but staring into the shadows. 1 drew 
out the fire-building, hoping that he 
would say something, anything. 
Eventually, he did. 



43 




“Whatever became of the grand 
design?” he asked. 

I did not know whether he was 
speaking of the Pattern or of some 
master plan of Dad’s to which he 
had been privy. So, “You tell me,” 
I said. 

He chuckled again. “Why not? 
You changed your mind, that is what 
happened,” he said. 

“From what to what — as you see 
it?” 

“Don’t mock me. Even you have 
no right to mock me,” he said. 
“Least of all, you.” 

I got to my feet. 

“I was not mocking you,” I 
said. 

I crossed the room to another 
chair and carried it over to a posi- 
tion near the fire, across from 
Dworkin. I seated myself. 

“How did you recognize me?” I 
asked. 

“My whereabouts are hardly 
common knowledge.” 

“That is true.” 

“Do many in Amber think me 
dead?” 

“Yes, and others suppose you 
might be traveling off in Shadow.” 

“I see.” 

“How have you been — feeling?” 

He gave me an evil grin. 

“Do you mean am I still mad?” 

“You put it more bluntly than I 
care to.” 

“There is a fading, there is an 
intensifying,” he said. “It comes to 
me and it departs again. For the 
moment I am almost myself — 
almost, I say. The shock of your 
visit, perhaps . Something is 
broken in my mind. You know that. 
It cannot be otherwise, though. You 
know that, too.” 

44 



“I suppose that I do,” I said. 
“Why don’t you tell me all about 
it, all over again? Just the business 
of talking might make you feel 
better, might give me something 
I’ve missed. Tell me a story.” 

Another laugh. 

“Anything you like. Have you 
any preferences? My flight from 
Chaos to this small sudden island in 
the sea of night? My meditations 
upon the abyss? The revelation of 
the Pattern in a jewel hung round 
the neck of a unicorn? My trans- 
cription of the design by lightning, 
blood and lyre while our fathers 
raged baffled, too late come to call 
me back while the poem of fire ran 
that first route in my brain, infect- 
ing me with the will to form? Too 
late! Too late . Possessed of the 
abominations born of the disease, 
beyond their aid, their power, I 
planned and built, captive of my 
new self. Is that the tale you’d hear 
again? Or rather I tell you of its 
cure?” 

My mind spun at the implications 
he had Just scattered by the fistful. I 
could not tell whether he spoke 
literally or metaphorically or was 
simply sharing paranoid delusions, 
but the things that I wanted to hear, 
had to hear, were things closer to 
the moment. 

So, regarding the shadowy image 
of myself from which that ancient 
voice emerged, “Tell me of its 
cure,” I said. 

He braced his fingertips together 
and spoke through them. 

“I am the Pattern,” he said, “in 
a very real sense. In passing 
through my mind to achieve the 
form it now holds, the foundation 
of Amber, it marked me as surely 

GALAXY 




as I marked it. I realized one day 
that I am both the Pattern and 
niyself, and it was forced to become 
Dworkin in the process of becoming 
itself. There were nlutual modifi- 
cations in the birthing of this place 
and this time, and therein lay our 
weakness as well as our strength. 
For it occurred to me that damage 
to the Pattern would be damage to 
tnyself, and damage to myself 
would be reflected within the 
Pattern. Yet I could not be truly 
harmed because the Pattern protects 
me, and who but I could harm the 
Pattern? A beautiful closed system, 
it seemed, its weakness totally 
shielded by its strength.” 

He fell silent. I listened to the 
fire. 1 do not know what he listened 
to. 

Then, ‘‘I was wrong,” he said. 
“Such a simple matter, too . My 
blood, with which I drew it, could 
deface it. But it took me ages to 
realize that the blood of my blood 
could also do this thing. You could 
use it, you could also change it — 
yea, unto the third generation.” 

It did not come to me as a sur- 
prise, learning that he was grandsire 
to us all. Somehow, it seemed that I 
had known all along, had known 
but never voiced it. Yet ... if 
anything, this raised more questions 
than it answered. Collect one 
generation of ancestry. Proceed to 
confusion. I had less idea now than 
ever before as to what Dworkin 
really was. Add to this the fact 
which even he acknowledged: It 
was a tale told by a madman. 

“But to repair it. ?” I said. 

He smirked, my own face twist- 
ing before me. 

“Have you lost your taste to be a 

the hand of OBERON 



Lord of the living void, a king of 
chaos?” he asked. 

“Mayhap,” I replied. 

“By the Unicorn thy mother, I 
knew it would come to this! The 
Pattern is as strong in you as is the 
greater realm. What then is your 
desire?” 

‘ To preserve the realm. ’ ’ 

He shook his/my head. 

“ Twould be simpler to destroy 
everything and try a new start — as I 
have told you so often before.” 
“I’m stubborn. So tell me 
again,” I said, attempting to 
simulate Dad’s gruffness. 

He shrugged. 

“Destroy the Pattern and we 
destroy Amber — and all of the 
shadows in polar array about it. 
Give me leave to destroy myself in 
the midst of the Pattern and we will 
obliterate it. Give me leave by giv- 
ing me your word that you will then 
take the Jewel which contains the 
essence of order and use it to create 
a new Pattern, bright and pure, 
untainted, drawing upon the stuff of 
your own being while the legions of 
chaos attempt to distract you on 
every side. lYomise me that and let 
me end it, for broken as I am, I 
would rather die for order than live 
for it. What say you now?” 

“Would it not be better to try 
mending the one we’ve got than to 
undo the work of eons?” 

“Coward!” he cried, leaping to 
his feet. “I knew you would say 
that again!” 

“Well, wouldn’t it?” 

He began to pace. 

“How many times have we been 
through this?” he asked. “Nothing 
has changed! You are afraid to try 
it!” 



45 




“Perhaps,” I said. “But do you 
not feel that something for which 
you have given so much is worth 
some effort — some additional 
sacrifice — if there is even a possi- 
bility of saving it?” 

“You still do not understand,” 
he said. “I cannot but think that a 
damaged thing should be 
destroyed — and hopefully replaced. 
The nature of my personal injury is 
such that I cannot envision repair. I 
am damaged in just this fashion. 
My feelings are foreordained.” 

If the Jewel can create a new 
Pattern, why will it not serve to 
repair the old one, end our troubles, 
heal your spirit?” 

He approached and stood before 
me. 

“Where is your memory?” he 
said. “You know that it would be 
infinitely more difficult to repair the 
damage than it would be to start 
over again. Have you forgotten 
what it is like out there?” He 
gestured toward the wall behind 
him. “Do you want to go and look 
at it again?” 

“Yes,” I said. “I would like 
that. Let’s go.” 

I rose and looked down at him. 
His control over his form had begun 
slipping when he had grown angry. 
He had already lost three or four 
inches in height, the image of my 
face was melting back into his own 
gnome-like features and a noticeable 
bulge was growing between his 
shoulders, had already been visible 
when he had gestured. 

His eyes widened and he studied 
my face. 

“You really mean it,” he said 
after a moment. “All right, then. 
Let us go.” 

46 



He turned and moved toward the 
big metal door. I followed him. He 
used both hands to turn the key. 
Then he threw his weight against it. 
I moved to help him, but he 
brushed me aside with extraordinary 
strength before giving the door a 
final shove. It made a grating noise 
and moved outward into a fully 
opened position. I was immediately 
struck by a strange, somehow 
familiar odor. 

Dworkin stepped through and 
paused. He located what looked to 
be a long staff leaning against the 
wall off to his right. He struck it 
several times against the ground and 
its upper end began to glow. It lit 
up the area fairly well, revealing a 
narrow tunnel into , which he now 
advanced. I followed him and it 
widened before too long, so that I 
was able to come up abreast of him. 
The odor grew stronger, and I could 
almost place it. It had been 
something fairly recent . 

It was close to eighty paces before 
our way took a turn to the left and 
upward. We passed then through a 
little appendix-like area. It was 
strewn with broken bones, and a 
large metal ring was set in the rock 
a couple feet above the floor. 
Affixed thereto was a glittering 
chain, which fell to the floor and 
trailed on ahead like a line of mol- 
ten droplets cooling in the gloom. 

Our way narrowed again after 
that and Dworkin took the lead once 
more. After a brief time, he turned 
an abrupt corner and I heard him 
muttering. I nearly ran into him 
when I made the turn myself. He 
was crouched down and groping 
with his left hand inside a shadowy 
cleft. When I heard the soft cawing 

GALAXY 




noise and saw that the chain van- 
ished into the opening I realized 
what it was and where we were. 

“Good Wixer,” I heard him say. 
“I am not going far. It is all right, 
good Wixer. Here is something to 
chew on.” 

From where he had fetched 
whatever he tossed the beast, I do 
not know. But the pruple griffin, 
which I had now advanced far 
enough to glimpse as it stirred 
within its lair, accepted the offering 
with a toss of its head and a series 
of crunching noises. 

Dworkin grinned up at me. 

“Surprised?” he asked. 

“At what?” 

“You thought I was afraid of 
him. You thought I would never 
make friends with him. You set him 
out here to keep me in there — away 
from the Pattern.” 

“Did I ever say that?” 

“You did not have to. I am not a 
fool.” 

“Have it your way,” I said. 

He chuckled, rose and continued 
on along the passageway. 

I followed and it grew level 
underfoot once again. The ceiling 
rose and the way widened. At 
length, we came to the cavemouth. 
Dworkin stood for a moment 
silhouetted, staff raised before him. 
It was night outside, and a clean 
salt smell swept the musk from my 
nostrils. 

Another moment, and he moved 
forward once more, passing into a 
World of sky-candles and blue 
velours. Continuing after him, I had 
psped briefly at the amazing view. 
It was not simply that the stars in 
the moonless, cloudless sky blazed 
with a preternatural brilliance, nor 

the hand of OBERON 



that the distinction between sky and 
sea had once again been totally 
obliterated. It was that the Pattern 
glowed an almost acetylene blue by 
the sky-sea, and all of the stars 
above, beside and below were 
arrayed with a geometric precision, 
forming a fantastic, oblique lat- 
ticework which, more than anything 
else, gave the impression that we 
hung in the midst of a cosmic web 
where the Pattern was the true 
center, the rest of the radiant 
meshwork a precise consequence of 
its existence, configuration, posi- 
tion. 

Dworkin continued on down to 
the Pattern, right up to the edge 
beside the darkened area. He waved 
his staff over it and turned to look 
at me Just as I came near. 

“There you are,” he announced, 
“the hole in my mind. I can no 
longer think through it, only around 
it. I no longer know what must be 
done to repair something I now 
lack. If you think that you can do 
it, you must be willing to lay 
yourself open to instant destruction 
each time you depart the Pattern to 
cross the break. Not destruction by 
the dark portion. Destruction by the 
Pattern itself when you break the 
circuit. The Jewel may or may not 
sustain you. I do not know. But it 
will not grow easier. It will become 
more difficult with each circuit, and 
your strength will be lessening all 
the while. The last time we discus- 
sed it you were afraid. Do you 
mean to say you have grown bolder 
since then?’ ’ 

“Perhaps,” I said. “You see no 
other way?” 

“I know it can be done starting 
with a clean slate, because once I 



47 




did it so. Beyond that, I see no 
other way. The longer you wait the 
more the situtation worsens. Why 
not fetch the Jewel and lend me 
your blade, son? I see no better 
way.” 

“No,” I said. ‘‘I must know 
more. Tell me again how the dam- 
age was done.” 

‘‘I still do not know which of 
your children shed our blood on this 
spot, if this is what you mean. It 
was done. Let it go at that. Our 
darker natures came forth strongly 
in them. It must be that they are too 
close to the chaos from which we 
sprang; growing without the 
exercises of will we endured in 
defeating it. I had thought that the 
ritual of traveling the Pattern might 
suffice for them. I could think of 
nothing stronger. Yet it failed. They 
strike out against everything. They 
seek to destroy the Pattern itself.” 
‘‘If we succeed in making a fresh 
start, might not these events simply 
repeat themselves?” 

‘‘I do not know. But what choice 
have we other than failure and a 
return to chaos?” 

‘‘What will become of them if 
we try for a new beginning?” 

He was silent for a long while. 
Then he shrugged. 

‘‘I cannot tell.” 

‘‘What would another generation 
have been like?” 

He chuckled. 

‘‘How can such a question be 
answered? I have no idea.” 

I withdrew the mutilated Trump 
and passed it to him. He regarded it 
near the blaze of his staff. 

‘‘I believe it is Random’s son 
Martin,” I said, ‘‘he whose blood 
was spilled here. I have no idea 

48 



whether he still lives. What do you 
think he might have amounted to?” 
He looked back out over the 
Pattern. 

‘‘So this is the object which 
decorated it,” he said. ‘‘How did 
you fetch it forth?” 

‘‘It was gotten,” I said. ‘‘It is 
not your work, is it?” 

‘‘Of course not. I have never set 
eyes on the boy. But this answers 
your question, does it not? If there 
is another generation your children 
will destroy it.” 

‘‘As we would destroy them?” 

He met my eyes and peered. 

‘‘Is it that you are suddenly 
becoming a doting father?” he 
asked. 

‘‘If you did not prepare that 
Trump, who did?” 

He glanced down and flicked it 
with his fingernail. 

‘‘My best pupil. Your son Brand. 
That is his style. See what they do 
as soon as they gain a little power? 
Would any of them offer their lives 
to preserve the realm, to restore the 
Pattern?” 

‘‘Probably,” I said. ‘‘Probably 
Benedict, Gerard, Random, 
Corwin . .” 

‘‘Benedict has the mark of doom 
upon him, Gerard possesses the will 
but not the wit. Random lacks 
courage and determinatioji. 
Corwin ... Is he not out of favor 
and out of sight?” ' 

My thoughts returned to our last 
meeting, when he had helped me to 
escape from my cell to Cabra. It 
occurred to me that he might have 
had second thoughts concerning 
that, not haying been aware of the 
circumstances which had put me 
there.

‘Is that why you have taken this 

form?” * 

fnanner of rebuke? Are you testing 

me again?” 

“He is neither out of favor nor 
sight,” I said, “though he has 
enemies among the family and 
elsewhere. He would attempt 
anything to preserve the realm. 
How do you see his chances?” 

“Has he not been away for a 



long while?” 

“Yes.” 

“Then he might have changed. I 
do not know.” 

“1 believe he is changed. I know 
that he is willing to try.” 

He stared at me again, and he 
kept staring. 

“You are not Oberon,” he said 



at length. 

“No.” 

“You are he whom I see before 
me.” 

“No more, no less.” 

“1 see ... I did not realize that 
you knew of this place.” 

“1 didn’t, until recently. The first 
time that I came here I was led by 
the unicorn.” 



His eyes widened. 

‘That is — very — interesting,” he 
said. “It has been so long ...” 
“What of my question?” 

“Eh? Question? Did you ask a 
question?” 

“My chances. Do you think I, 
ntight be able to repair the Pat- 
tern?” 



, He advanced slowly, and reach- 
'"6 up, placed his right hand on my 
shoulder. 

The staff tilted in his other hand as 
nu did so; its blue light flared within a 
l^oot of my face, but I felt no heat. He 
looked into my eyes. 

the hand of oberon 



“You have changed,” he said, 
after a time. 

“Enough,” I asked, “to do the 
job?” 

He looked away. 

“Perhaps enough to make it 
worth trying,” he said, “even if we 
are foredoomed to failure.” 

“Will you help me?” 

“I do not know,” he said, “that 
1 will be able. This thing with my 
moods, my thoughts — it cotnes and 
it goes. Even now, I feel some of 
my control slipping away. The 
excitement, perhaps . We had 
best get back inside.” 

I heard a clinking noise at my 
back. When I turned, the griffin 
was there, his head swinging slowly 
from left to right, his tail from right 
to left, his tongue darting. He began 
to circle us, halting when he came 
to a position between Dworkin and 
the Pattern. 

“He knows,” Dworkin said. 
“He can sense it when I begin to 
change. He will not let me near the 
Pattern then. — Good Wixer. We 
are returning now. It is all right. 
— Come, Corwin.” 

We headed back toward the 
cavemouth and Wixer followed, a 
clink for every pace. 

“The Jewel,” I said, “the Jewel 
of Judgment ... You say that it is 
necessary for the repair of the 
Pattern?” 

“Yes,” he said. “It would have 
to be borne the entire distance 
through the Pattern, reinscribing the 
original design in the places where 
it has been broken. This could only 
be done by one who is attuned to 
the Jewel, though.” 

“I am attuned to the Jewel,” I 
said.

“How did you manage that?” he 
asked, halting. 

Wixer made a cackling noise 
behind us, and we resumed walk- 
ing. 

“1 followed your written 
instructions — and Eric’s verbal 
ones,” I said. “I took it with me to 
the center of the Pattern and pro- 
jected myself through it.” 

“1 see,” he said. “How did you 
obtain it?” 

“Eric gave it to me, on his death- 
bed.” 

We entered the cave. 

“You have it now?” 

“I was forced to cache it in a 
place off in Shadow.” 

“1 would suggest you retrieve it 
quickly and bring it here or take it 
back to the palace. It is best kept 
near the center of things.” 

“Why is that?” 

“It tends to have a distorting 
effect on shadows if it lies too long 
among them.” 

“Distorting? In what fashion?” 

“There is no way to tell, in 
advance. It depends entirely upon 
the locale.” 

We rounded a corner, continued 
on back through the gloom. 

“What does it mean,” I said, 
“when you are wearing the Jewel 
and everything begins to slow down 
about you? Fiona warned me that 
this was dangerous, but she was not 
certain why.” 

“It means that you have reached 
the bounds of your own existence, 
that your energies will shortly be 
exhausted, that you will die unless 
you do something quickly.” 

“What is that?” 

“Begin to draw power from the 
Pattern itself — the primal Pattern 

GALAXY 



within the Jewel.” 

‘‘How is this achieved?” 

‘‘You must surrender to it, re- 
lease yourself, blot out your identi- 
ty, erase the bounds which separate 
you from everything else.” 

‘‘It sounds easier said than 
done.” 

‘‘But it can, be done, and it is 
the only way.” 

I shook my head. We moved on, 
coming at last to the big door. 
Dworkin extinguished the staff and 
leaned it against the wall. We 
entered and he secured the door. 
Wixer had stationed himself just 
outside. 

‘‘You will have to leave now,” 
Dworkin said. 

‘‘But there are many more things 
that I must ask you, and some that I 
would like to tell you.” 

‘‘My thoughts grow meaningless, 
and your words would be wasted. 
Tomorrow night, or the next, or the 
next. Hurry! Go!” 

‘‘Why the rush?” 

‘‘I may harm you when the 
change comes over me. 1 am hold- 
ing it back by main will now. 
Depart!” 

‘‘I do not know how. I know 
how to get here, but — ” 

‘‘There are all manner of special 
Trumps in the desk in the next 
room. Take the light! Go anywhere! 
Get out of here!” 

1 was about to protest that I 
hardly feared any physical violence 
he could muster, when his features 
began to flow like melting wax and 
he somehow seemed much larger 
and longer-limbed than he had 
been. Seizing the light, I fled the 
room, a sudden chill upon me. 

.... To the desk. I tore open 

THE HAND OF OBERON 



the drawer and snatched at some 
Trumps which lay scattered within 
it. I heard footsteps then, of 
something entering the room behind 
me, coming from the chamber I had 
just departed. They did not seem 
like the footsteps of a man. I did 
not look back. Instead, I raised the 
cards before me and regarded the 
one on top. It was an unfamiliar 
scene, but I opened my mind 
immediately and reached for it. A 
mountain crag, something indistinct 
beyond it, a strangely stippled sky, 
a scattering of stars to the 
left . The card was alternately 
hot and cold to my touch, and a 
heavy wind seemed to come blow- 
ing through it as I stared, somehow 
rearranging the prospect. 

From right behind me then, the 
heavily altered but still recognizable 
voice of Dworkin spoke: ‘‘Fool! 
You have chosen the land of your 
doom!” 

A great claw-like hand — black, 
leathery, gnarled — reached over my 
shoulder, as if to snatch the card 
away. But the vision seemed ready, 
and I rushed forward into it, turning 
the card from me as soon as I 
realized 1 had made my escape. 
Then I halted and stood stock-still, 
to let my senses adjust to the new 
locale. 

I knew. From snatches of legend, 
bits of family gossip and from a 
general feeling which came over 
me, I knew the place to which I had 
come. It was with full certainty as 
to identity that I raised my eyes to 
look upon the Courts of Chaos.

Man, too, la a 
Miracle of Nature. 

Home late, hot and tired. To- 
night he treats himself to Chivas 
Regal and the last of the excelleni 
roast beef Jenny had left him in the 
ice-box. A garlic pickle, black 
bread to go with. Cheese, sage 
Cheddar; not quite as good as the 
ads, but okay. 

He flops tiredly by the TV, twirls 
the dials. Too late. Goodnight foi 
NBC. Fade to some National Geo 
graphic thing. Chewing, he watches 
the character explaining how te 
tranquillize beavers. The beavefs 
look toothy, inscrutable. Marl 
borough music. Men are pu' 
ting the beavers in bags, the bags if 
baskets on a pack-horse. Beavef-

jje ecological. He gathers they are 
j^ing taken up a strip-mined moun- 
tain to be released. There they will 
start right in doing their beaver 
tjting, making dams, catching silt, 
rebuilding the forests. Very neat; 
miracles of nature. 

He has another Chivas Regal, 
wondering if the beavers in the bags 
like each other. When the man turns 
them loose they hump off wildly in 
different directions. A couple act 
damaged but the camera pans 
quickly to an okay beaver disap- 
pearing up a dry gulch, syn- 
chronised with Disney music. Next 
week, Spearing the Giant Manta. 

He kills the commercial and 
wanders out onto the dark patio. 
Still hot. Lights all around now. 
This was all woodland when he and 
Jenny came out five years ago. 
Supposed to be five-acre zoning, 
but the commission ran in a sewer- 
line and changed that. 

He studies what can be seen of 
the sky above the lights. Summer 
storm building up over Bald Peak, 
west of town. Big sheet flash. A 
loud blare of amped-up C&W is 
coming from the Bannerman’s 
patio, another of their interminable 
parties. “Bashes,” Joan Bannerman 
trails them, grinning with post- 
tttenopausal gaiety. The Banner- 
tttans have two oafish teen-age 
*°ns. Joan dresses like their sister, 
j^tdes herself on her figure. Riding 
“ohind them on their Harley- 
^avidsons to the postoffice, for 
fiod’s sake. Wagon wheels and cow 



skulls around their big swimming 
pool. 

He sighs, appreciating Jenny, 
even appreciating the baby at this 
distance. No, that isn’t fair, he’s a 
good little guy. In two more days 
she’ll be back, Jenny and Jim- 
my ... He grunts uxoriously, 
scratching his arse on the redwood 
table. Two more nights. To Grand- 
mother’s house we go. Only why 
the hell Grandmother lives in Santa 
Barbara. Good thing overall, 
though. Feeling mellow now he 
whistles softly at an awakened 
mockingbird that is answering the 
Bannerman stampede. 

There’s one dark patch of woods 
left, around the Jacksons’ house. 
Last black family left out here. Ex- 
farmland. They own their land. 
Probably sell out soon. Nice 
neighbors; six kids, no noise at all. 
Doubtless being kept awake by 
middle-class honky uproar. 

A massive flickering over Bald 
Peak now, quite a display. Jenny 
says there’s no such thing as 
“summer” lightning, merely a 
storm somewhere else. If so it’s a 
good one, maybe it’ll bring rain. 
We need it; water table is way 
down, wells going dry since they’ve 
paved half the county. Should get 
the weather forecast, he thinks, and 
on impulse goes back in and flips 
on the radio weather station. On the 
fritz again, nothing but squeals. 
Without Jenny everything goes to 
hell fast. 

He spins to a news channel, gets 



53 




some kind of science-fiction late 
show, more static. Jenny will fix it. 
Two more nights. Should he finish 
up the whiskey? 

He decides against it; heavy day 
tomorrow. Thursday always the 
worst of the week, never ask any- 
body for anything on Thursdays. 
The Bannerman bedlam seems to be 
increasing. Shrieks and loud male 
bellowing through the PA. Goddam 
it, outdoor PA systems are illegal 
now, one good thing. Should he go 
over there and remonstrate? No, 
wait for Jenny, she does that kind 
of thing better. Especially if it 
wakes up the baby. 

He grins lonesomely, closing 
windows on the Bannerman side. 
Thank god it’s cooling off, but the 
air really stinks. Gassy. Imagine 
smog out here, he thinks disgust- 
edly, sliding shut the patio doors. 
The last thing he remembers is a 
sudden stillness from the Banner- 
man patio . 

* * * 

... A mean slick hardness under 
his cheek. He rejects it, wills it to 
become smooth bed sheets. Too 
hard — a floor, say the patio tiles. 
Please god, let it be tiles, let it be a 
coronary even. 1 hurt. It’s a minor 
coronary, that’s all. 

But the pain isn’t in his chest, 
it’s in his leg. His arm, too. And oh 
yes, the Jaw, which he has tried 
imperceptibly to move. Very bad; 
he decides against trying to move

anything else, lies with his eye$ 
shut. I did fight — 

He abolishes thought, tries to 
wrap unconsciousness around him. 
But the drug, gas, whatever, is 
wearing thin. The horrible slick 
floor under his face has begun to 
hum, buzzes through his bones like 
an angry insect. / did fight — 

And at that moment he sees it all 
again, the awful view from the con- 
veyor or whatever it was, when he 
had waked to find himself sprawled 
on metal mesh which was carrying 
him higher and higher above the 
early dawn countryside. High-pitched 
whine of machinery ... He re- 
members blurrily raising his head, 
seeing the dim lumps of other 
bodies ascending behind him. And 
then as. the thing stopped two or 
three hundred feet up in nowhere, 
he had turned and seen the cliff of 
metal alongside. The dark cliff, the 
darker gaping port, and THEM. 
Coming for him, reaching with 
things — 

In that instant he realized with 
total lucidity that he was here while 
Jenny and his child were in Califor- 
nia two thousand miles away; he 
will never conceivably see either of 
them again if he does not act. He 
leaps, throws himself hurtfully 
across alien machinery, trying to 
scramble away, slide down — if 
necessary fall down — anything not 
to be taken by THEM, into 
THAT — but it’s too late, things 
have seized and coiled around him 
as he struggles. He flails, kicks and 

GALAXY 




bites metal until the nauseating fog 
blotted his world. 

Yes, I fought, he forms now with 
lips on hardness, refusing to 
open his eyes, to admit any of this, 
gut he cannot shut out the hum- 
uiing, and above it the susurrus of 
other breathing around him. Some- 
thing or somebody is making a high 
thin rasping sound, Ekkk-hnhnhn, 
Ek-kkk-hhhn, like a delirious chick- 
en. 

The drumming under his head is 
louder, is making his jaw hurt intol- 
erably. Teeth are broken from 
grinding on metal or moving metal- 
lic flesh. He has a searing memory 
of sentient coils against his body 
and vomit suddenly shoots up his 
throat, literally Jumps against his 
teeth. Projectile vomiting, he re- 
members this is called. Without 
moving he lets it trickle out, re-tast- 
ing decomposed whiskey. 

Against his will, vision has 
penetrated between the lashes of his 
good eye. A dim grey light, which 
seems to be coming from the slick- 
ness of the floor. In his line of sight 
is a bare tanned ankle. Involuntarily 
he follows the young line of the leg 
in faded jeans. Beyond the jeans is 
a mauve t-shirt, a heavy mane of 
reddish gold hair. It is not Jenny, 
^he girl is lying face down, breai- 
*ng okay. The rasping whine is 
coming from beyond her. 

Very slowly he lets his eyes 
°Pen. He can see a corner of the 
cell or compartment. The wall is 
shiny like the floor. A cargo-space. 

leaver tears 



The ship probably is full of them. 

Crouched against the wall in a 
curious squatting posture is a wom- 
an. In the dim under-lighting her 
face looks like a frog. Then he rec- 
ognises her: Joan Bannerman. She 
is making the gasping. 

After a moment he realises that 
there is another figure in the far 
corner of his field of vision. By 
squinting over his shoulder, not 
moving his head, he can see a face 
down by the floor, It is looking at 
Joan Bannerman, a round brown 
face, screwed into a toothy rigid 
mask. A memory from another 
world flicks him; the beavers on 
TV. But this is not a beaver, it is a 
human child. Finally he remembers. 
She is Evelyn, or Jacqueline, one of 
the Jacksons’ kids. About eight. 
She is clutching her arm, which 
seems to have bled heavily. He will 
have to face reality now, he knows; 
he must move, get up, help the 
child. 

But as he thinks this a huge 
clanging rush of sound rocks the 
chamber, almost tears him loose 
from consciousness. Pain rips 
through him, while in the deeps of 
his heart a shutter closes forever on 
a world of green and sunlight. The 
ship is taking off. Jenny, Jimmy. 
Gone, lock it away. Bite down. 

Dizzy, trying not to vomit again, 
he thinks, we did it. Whatever it 
was, we did our human thing. We 
fixed it the way they liked. Concrete, 
carbon monoxide, the sea full of 
plastic and oil, who knows. What 

56 



we do. It’s fixed up for them, s® 
now they’re moving some of uj 
along to start fixing up another 
Hundreds, maybe thousands of us 
Beavers. A batch per so many zil]! 
ion square miles, per planet even 
who knows? 

With that the drug or anaesthetic 
wears completely away and the pain 
from his thigh and his broken face 
becomes unbearable. His leg must 
be splintered, really he needs medi- 
cal care. A groan escapes him. He 
tries to turn sidewise, wondering if 
Joan Bannerman can help him, or 
maybe the strange girl on the floor. 

Joan Bannerman is staring 
blindly, muttering “Harry, Harry,” 
with her fingers in her mouth. No 
help there. The girl? 

The girl is moving now, he sees, 
waking up. Apparently not hurt. 
She rolls over with luxurious sleepy 
ease and farts loudly. 

“Mom?” 

Oh god, it is not a girl at all. It is 
Oscar Bannerman. 

“Mom!” Oscar repeats querul- 
ously. His mother does not react. 
Suddenly a hand comes from 
nowhere and slaps her on the face. 
Jesu.s — there’s another youth here, 
squatting by the wall beyond Joan. 
It’s not her other son, it’s that 
friend of theirs who shot the cat. 
Billy Dee something. 

Joan Bannerman comes jerkily to 
life and starts patting her youngest, 
still crooning “Harry ...” 

“Okay, Mom.” Oscar shrugs off 
her hand. He and Billy Dee g®* 

galaxv 




groggily up on their feet, staring 
around. Their eyes are not em- 
pathic. 

Beneath the pain a deathly hys- 
teria is rising in him. The aliens, he 
thinks, do not seem to know much 
about human biology. Or they don’t 
care. Maybe they use some easy 
mark like hair, maybe they thought 
Oscar was a female . One pre- 
pubescent and one wombless 
female, to colonise what? Their 
ecological operations must be on 
such a large scale that little slip-ups 
'ike this don’t matter. We dump 
'ttillions of trout from planes, some 
of them live. 

“You okay, Ossie?” Billy Dee 
inquires. 

Oscar farts again, giggles. Billy 
*-'ee nods in approval, his small, 

leaver tears 



slightly crossed eyes roving between 
the black child and the wounded 
man on the floor, himself. 

No one says anything. In the si- 
lence rise faint clangors of alien 
might. The little Jackson girl has 
her flat terrified stare fixed on Billy 
Dee. And now another, final pre- 
sence is perceptible behind her in 
the dim cell. 

Please god, he thinks, let it be 
someone okay. Painfully he twists 
his head to see. 

It is her thirteen-year-old brother 
Payton, a lithe black youth 
crouched death-still with a glinting 
object in one hand. 

No. Letting himself sink down 
through pain’s claws, he decides 
this is not going to be one of the 
successful ones. ★

A STEP 

FARTHER 

OUT 



This may be a unique century 
in many ways. In one respect it cer- 
tainly is: this is the first time that 
mankind has had the resources to 
leave Earth and make his home in 
the solar system. No one doubts 
that we can do it. It takes only de- 
tennination and investment. 

Alas, we may be unique in 
another way: ours may be the only 
century in all of history when man- 
kind can break free of Earth. Our 
opportunity may not come again, 
per omnia secula seculorum. Thus 
it could be that we have it in our 
power to condemn our descendants 
to imprisonment forever. 

Last month I wrote about Surviv- 
al with Style: how we can, if we 
will, usher in the Third Industrial 
Revolution through exploitation of 
*Pace, and thereby supply Earth 
with non-polluting energy and met- 
als for millennia. One reader com- 
ttiented as follows: “I remain skep- 
tical. By the time man is forced to 
accept population control, the world 

going to be in a sadder state than 
*t is now. And I doubt if nations 
Will give up their armaments and 



their free school lunches in order to 
get the resources to mine the as- 
teroids until the situation is so bad 
that we probably can’t mine the as- 
teroids in time to save us.” 

Unfortunately he may be right. 
There is no end to forseeable crises, 
and enough of them could so de- 
plete our resource base and 
technological ability that when we 
realize that we must go to space, we 
won’t be able to get there. Fur- 
thermore, anti-technological senti- 
ments are no joke; a great number 
of influential intellectuals have em- 
braced Zero-Growth, condemn 
technology, and seem to want the 
next generation to atone for the sins 
of our forefathers. They do not ap- 
pear to want themselves to atone; I 
haven’t seen many leading intellec- 
tuals giving up their own luxuries, 
much less necessities, in order to 
make amends for the “rapre of the 
Earth”, “eco-doom”, or the rest of 
what engineers and technologists are 
accused of. We shall continue to en- 
joy; but after us. The Deluge. Our 
children shall pay. 

And of course if Zero-Growth has 




its way, our children will pay; but 
ours won’t pay as much as the chil- 
dren of the people in the developing 
countries. Those kids are doomed 
with no chance at all. 

bo not misunderstand. Were 
Earth our only source of energy and 
resources I should probably myself 
be crying Doom. As it is I fully 
support many conservation mea- 
sures — and in fact I was writing 
pro-conservation articles as early as 
1957. I’ve no use for wasters of 
Earth’s bounty. But I’ve less use for 
those who would condemn most of 
the world to eternal poverty when 
we can do something about it. 

Incidentally, the Club of Rome, 
which sponsored the original com- 
puter studies leading to The Limits 
To Growth and provides much of 
the intellectual fuel for Zero- 
Growth, has sponsored a second re- 
port entitled Mankind At The Turn- 
ing Point (MATTP). This book, un- 
like Limits, is supposed to hold out 
some hope for the poor. By looking 
at the world as a set of 10 “re- 
gions” we can, say the authors of 
MATTP, divide the wealth and sus- 
tain what they call “balanced 
growth”. 

Unfortunately they never tell us 
how. As one reviewer put it, “I do 
not find any clear explanation of the 
ways in which balancing out the re- 
gions of the world would lead to 
any lessening of the total demands 
of human civilization on the 
planet’s living-space, resources, and 
vital eco-systems.” (Frank Hopkins, 

60 



in the October, 1975 Futurist.) 
Moreover, the MATTP plan de- 
mands foreign aid at the rate of 
some $500 billion a year at the end 
of a 50 year development period. 
True, there are plans with less mas- 
sive foreign aid donations; but all 
are truly enormous, and like Zero- 
Growth must be started now or we 
are all doomed. 

And this is nonsense. No politi- 
cian is going to run for office on a 
platform of international bounty. No 
democratic — or communist — nation 
is going to shell out limited wealth 
at that rate. And even if, by some 
miracle, the western nations were to 
divvy up with everyone else, the 
Second Report can’t challenge one 
feature of The Limits To Growth: no 
matter how wildly successful we are 
in imposing Zero-Growth and popu- 
lation control, in 400 years the 
game will be over. We will have 
run out of non-renewable resources. 
Mankind will be forced to give up 
high-energy civilization and return 
to some kind of pastoral society. 

Surely this is not a desirable 
goal? There may be those who 
dream of the simple life (and a les- 
ser number who will actually 
choose to live it), but surely only a 
madman would impose it on ev- 
eryone else without dire necessity? 
If there is any alternative, must we 
not take it? 

■* * * 

There are alternatives. They 

GALAXY 




aren’t even very expensive com- 
pared to the MATTP plan. Take, 
for example, the detailed plans of 
Princeton professor Gerard K. 
O’Neill. 

Deaths of what have come to be 
called “O’Neill Colonies’’ were 
first widely published in the Sept. 
1974 issue of Physics Today. The 
plan has been modified somewhat 
since that time, most recently by a 
week-long NASA-sponsored confer- 
ence of some of the biggest names 
in space exploration, but the basic 
concept remains the same: building 
self-sustaining colonies in space. 
O’Neill colonies have a major a‘d- 
vantage: they are not only self- 
sustaining, but will be capable of 
building more colonies without fur- 
ther investment from Earth. When 
the first ones have been completed, 
Earth need pay no more. In addi- 
tion, the colonies will be able to 
make important contributions to 
Earth’s economy. 

There’s been a great deal of ex- 
citement in the science community, 
and of course among science fiction 
fans, although oddly enough most 
SF writers haven’t put much about 
O’Neill colonies into print. In my 
own case I assumed others would, 
and I was waiting for new details. 
Even so, much of the SF commun- 
ity is aware of the O’Neill concept. 
“Life in Space’’ is now a regular 
program item at science fiction con- 
ventions, and will be a major topic 
of one of the panels I’m chairing at 
the next Labor Day’s World SF 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



Convention. 

(For convention details, write 
MiDAMERicoN, Box 221, Kansas 
City, MO, 64141.) 

The basic O’Neill plan is for colo- 
nies able to support from 10 to 50 
thousand people each. They will be 
located in the L4 and L5 points of 
the Earth-Moon system. Since not 
all readers know what that means, 
and the location is important to the 
economics of the project, let me 
take a moment to explain Trojan 
Points. 

The equations of gravitational at- 
traction are so complex that we 
can’t really predict where planets, 
satellites, moons, etc., will be after 
long periods of time. Given high- 
speed computers we can make ap- 
proximations, but we can’t precisely 
solve problems involving three or 
more bodies except in special cases. 
A long time ago LaGrange discov- 
ered one of those special cases, 
namely, that when a system consists 
of three objects, one extremely 
large with respect to the rest, and a 
third very small with respect to the 
other two, there are five points of 
stability: that is, things that get to 
those points tend to stay there. 
These are often called “LaGrangian 
Points’’ and designated as LI, 
L2, . , L5. They are illustrated 
in Figure One. 

Three of the five are not really 
stable: that is, if an object is per- 
turbed out of LI, L2, or L3, it 
won’t tend to return. The other two, 
L4 and L5, are dynamically stable: 

61 





left to themselves things put there 
will stay forever. 

Points L4 and L5 are named Tro- 
jan Points because in the Sol-Jupi- 
ter system these points are occupied 
by a number of asteroids named 
after Trojan War heroes. The Tro- 
jans trail Jupiter, while the Greeks 
lead. Unfortunately the custom of 
naming the Eastern group for 
Greeks and the Western for Trojans 
wasn’t established before one as- 
teroid in each cluster was named for 
the wrong class of hero; thus there’s 
a Trojan spy in the Greek camp, 
and vice-versa. 

Because of perturbing influences 
of other planets Trojan Points aren’t 
really “points”; the Trojan as- 

62 



teroids drift around within y 
sausage-shaped area about one AU 
(93,000,000 miles) in diameter, 
while objects in the Earth-Moon 
Trojan points would tend to drift a 
few thousand miles one way or 
another. No matter; they’re stable 
enough. Colonies and supplies, 
once they arrive at L4 or L5, won’t 
go anywhere. The points are, of 
course, 240,000 miles from Earth 
and an equal distance from the 
Moon. 

O’Neill colonies will be big. 
Even the first model, which is in- 
tended as an assembly base and fac- 
tory, will be several kilometers in 
diameter. Later models will be 
larger. One design calls for a cylin- 
der 6 kilometers in diameter and 
several times that in length, with 
“windows” running lengthwise to 
let in sunlight, large mirrors outside 
to focus more sunlight, and every- 
thing from farms and houses to 
trout streams in the “land” areas 
under the windows. The cylinders 
slowly rotate to provide artificial 
gravity. The exact gravity wanted 
isn’t known yet, but it will certainly 
be less than that of, Earth, possibly 
low enough that man-powered flight 
(yes, I mean people with artificial 
wings) will be not only feasible, but 
the usual means of personal trans- 
portation. As O’Neill points out, a 
great number of energy-consuming 
activities required for civilization of 
Earth can be greatly simplified if 
the colonies. 

It’s possible to wax poetic about 

galaxy 



the life in O’Neill colonies, 

Ijyt 1 won’t do that. In the first 
oiace, I niay be far-out technologi- 
cally- but I don’t think people are 
likely to live in Utopian style no 
niatter how pleasant their environ- 
ment. The important point is that 
life can be pleasant, and certainly 
possible, in space colonies. 

These colonies are to be self- 
sufficient: they have more than 
enough agricultural area to feed 
their inhabitants. They are self- 
generating, with a duplication time 
of under ten years; over the long 
haul they could be built fast enough 
to accomodate some of Earth’s 
surplus population. That, however, 
is not a major selling point, and 
we’ll ignore it here. 

Most importantly for our pur- 
poses the O’Neill colonies can sell 
power to Earth. It is perfectly feasi- 
ble to collect solar radiation, con- 
vert it to electricity, and beam the 
juice down to Earth by micro-wave. 
Tests show that the cycle, from DC 
to DC, is about 65% efficient — and of 
course most of the wasted energy 
doesn’t get to Earth in the first 
place. There are a number of de- 
signs for the Earth-based receivers. 
The one 1 like best is a grid of 
"''•'es several meters above ground; 
energy densities underneath are low 
enough to let cattle graze in the pas- 
'**’es below the grid.

a bit far-fetched? No. O’Neill

and no magic systems. We could 
now begin building an O’Neill col- 
ony this year, occupy it in 1990, 
and by the year 2000 have a couple 
more of them built. In which case 
we could also be supplying about as 
much power to Earth as the Alaskan 
pipeline will. In 20 more years 
space could supply nearly all US 
electric power.* 

So why don’t we do it? 

It’s bloody expensive, that’s why. 
Make no mistake: this would be a 
costly undertaking, on a level of ef- 
fort compared to the Interstate 
Highway System, or the Viet Nam 
War. It would not, in my judge- 
ment, be nearly so expensive as 
Zero-Growth, but unfortunately the 
costs of space colonies are visible. 
They’re direct expenditures. The 
costs of Zero-Growth are hidden, 
since the most costly part is in po- 
tential not used and goods not 
created. 

In the December 5, 1975 Sci- 
ence (the prestigious publication 
of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science) Dr. 
O’Neill presents an economic 
analysis of satellite solar power sta- 
tions (SSPS’s) and Space Manufac- 
turing Facilities. He comes up with 
total costs ranging from a low of 
$31 billion — about the proportion of

colonies might write the LS Society, 1^20 N.

newsletter and lobbies for NASA support for

GNP that Apollo cost — to a high of 
$185 billion. He also discusses ben- 
efits from the electric power pro- 
duced by SSPS’s, and concludes 
that over a 40 year period the 
facilities would show actual profits 
from sales of power alone. 

As a co-discoverer (with Poul 
Anderson) of what was once known 
in the aerospace industry as Pour- 
nelle’s Law of Costs and Schedules 
(“Everything takes longer and costs 
more.”), I tend to distrust Dr. 
O’Neill’s numbers. It hardly makes 
any difference. The important point 
is that the program is feasible. We 
could afford it. Take a worst-case. 
Suppose it takes 25 years, and the 
total cost is 50 Apollo programs, 
that is, a round one trillion bucks. 
The money must be spent at $40 
billion a year for the next 25 years, 
which comes to $200 a year for 
every man, woman, and child in the 
US. In my own family it would be 
about $1000 a year. 

That’s a lot of money. Worth it, I 
think; the benefits are literally in- 
calculable. For example, by the 
year 2000 the US will need 2 bil- 
lion tons of coal annually simply to 
operate our electric power system. 
Nuclear power plants could reduce 
that substantially, but the nuclear 
industry is in deep — not tech- 
nological — trouble. It would be 
worth a lot to me simply to avoid 
the strip mines that 2 billion tons a 
year will require. 

Moreover, the space budget isn’t 
going to be simply tacked onto the 

64 



national budget. All of the money 
will be spent here on Earth — people 
living in Lunar and space colonies 
have no need for Earth dollars, and 
what they physically import is tiny 
compared to the salaries that will be 
paid to Earth workers manufacturing 
products for the colony program. 
With $40 billion a year in high* 
technology industries, we can 
eliminate a number of “pump- 
priming” expenditures and disman- 
tle several welfare and unemploy- 
ment compensation schemes as 
well. 

Of course we won’t really need 
to spend that kind of money, and I 
suspect we can start getting returns 
on that investment before 25 years, 
O’Neill himself thinks in terms of 
some $5 billion a year, which 
works out to $25 a head for each 
person in the US; and the colonic 
have got to be worth that if only is 
entertainment value. 

Now how can something as com- 
plex as space colonies be built for 
that low a price? And wouldn’t it be 
cheaper to build space manufactur- 
ing facilities in near-Earth orbit 
rather than going out to L5? 

That’s the beauty of the O’Neill 
concept. All the building materials 
for the colonies must, of course, be 
put into orbit — but it need not come 
from Earth. Most of the raw mate- 
rials for the L5 colony will come 
from the Moon. 

The Moon has one twentieth the 
gravity well that Earth does. The 
colonies will be in stable Trojan 

galaxy 




points. Put those two data together 
and you reach an interesting conclu- 
sion: much of the mass of the 
colonies need never have been 
launched by rockets at all. 

There are several devices for get- 
ting lunar materials to the L5 point. 
One involves a simple centrifugal 
arm: a big solar-powered gizmo 
similar to the thing used to pitch 
baseballs for batting practice. It 
flings gup, such as unrefined Lunar 
ore (25-35% metal, from our ran- 
dom samples) out to the L5 point, 
and the laws of gravity keep it 
there. Refining takes place at the 
colony, and the slag is useful as 
dirt, cosmic ray shielding, and just 
plain mass. There’s also oxygen in 
them there rocks. 

Another workable device is the 
linear accelerator — a long electric 
sled as used in countless science fic- 
tion stories. Both these can be built 
with present technology. 

Obviously, then, O’Neill colonies 
have a pre-requisite, namely, a 
permanent Lunar Colony. Now 
that’s certainly within present-day 
technology; 1 once did studies that 
demonstrated that with technology 
available in the 60’s we could keep 
astronauts and scientists alive for 
years on the Lunar surface, and 
things have come a long way since 
then. 

The Lunar Colony will need at 
*^ast one near-Earth manned space 
station, since Earth-orbit to Lunar- 
orbit is the most efficient way to 
transport large masses of materials 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



from here to there. The Lunar Shut- 
tle will be assembled in space, and 
won’t have all that waste structure 
that would enable it to withstand 
planetary ^gravity; thus it can carry 
far more payload per trip. 

It’s here that I think the profits 
come in. SKYLAB demonstrated 
that space manufacturing operations 
have fantastic potential profits. 
There are things we can make in 
space that simply cannot be made 
on Earth. Materials research bene- 
fits alone might pay for the space 
station. Certainly the potential for 
Earth-watch operations, pollution 
monitoring, better weather predic- 
tion, increased communications, and 
all the other benefits we’ve already 
got from space, will contribute to 
profits as well. 

And once space shows a visible 
return on investment, we may well 
be on our way. 

So. The pre-requisite for the 
space station is the Shuttle; and 
there’s the weak point. The Shuttle 
is in trouble. There are a number of 
Congresscritters who’d like nothing 
better than to convert the Shuttle 
into benefits for their own districts. 
There are plenty of intellectuals 
who continually do cry “Why must 
we waste money in space when 
there are so many needs on Earth?’’ 
The obvious reply, that most of our 
expenditures on Earth seem to have 
vanished with no visible benefit, 
while our space program has al- 
ready just about paid for itself in 
better weather prediction alone, 

65 




does not impress these gentlemen. 

There are also the Zero-Growth 
theorists who see investment in 
space not as a mere waste of 
money, but as a positive evil. 

We are close to breakthrough. 
For a whack of a lot less than we 
spend on liquor, or on cigarettes 
and cosmetics, on new highways we 
don’t need, on countless tiny drains 
that fritter away the hopes of man- 
kind, the United States alone could 
break out of Earth’s prison and send 
men to space. The effect on future 
generations is literally incalculable. 
We can do it; but will we? 

it it -k 

1 wish I were sure that we would; 
or that if we of the US don’t do it, 
somebody else will; but I am not. 
There are just too many disaster 
scenarios. A Great Depression. 
War. The triumph of anti- 
technological ideology. The con- 
tinued ruin of our educational 
system — in California, with 30 State 
Universities, there is not one in 
which bonehead English is not the 
largest single class, and the retreat 
from excellence (called democratiza- 
tion and equality of opportunity) 
races onward. Any of these, or all 
of them at once, could throw away 
an opportunity that may never again 
come to mankind. 

So what can we do? 

For one thing, we can organize at 
least as well as the opposition. Sci- 
ence fiction readers may have 

66 



mixed emotions about “ecology” 
movements, consumerism, Zero- 
Growth, and the like, but I think we 
have not lost our sense of wonder, 
nor abandoned our hopes. We have 
not given up the vision of man’s 
vast future among the stars. We 
have not traded the future of man 
for a few luxuries in our time. 

Unfortunately, we have no voice, 
or rather, we have a myriad of 
voices, none very effective. That at 
least we can remedy. There is a 
blanket, organization whose goals I 
think most of us can accept, and I 
urge all of you to consider joining 
it. It is called the National Space 
Institute, (NSI). Its president is 
Werner von Braun and the Directors 
are professionals. Its purpose is to 
keep the faith; to keep alive the 
technology we need, to feed the 
dream, and ceaselessly to tell public 
officials just how important space is 
to all of us. 

NSI dues are $15 a year, $9 for 
students. You may join by sending 
the money to National Space Insti- 
tute, 1911 N. Fort Myer Drive, 
Suite 408, Arlington, VA 22209. 
Dues and other contributions are tax 
deductible. It has publications and 
such like, but that’s not the reason 
to join. NSI’s real benefit to mem- 
bers is as spokesman for our 
dreams. 

In the 50’s a number of us in the 
aircraft industry used to bootleg 
space research. There wasn’t any 
budget for that crazy Buck Rogers 
stuff. Most of us believed we would 

GAIAXV 




see the day when the first man set 
foot on the Moon. We didn’t be- 
lieve we’d see the last one. 1 hope 
we haven’t. 

Like many of us who recall pre- 
sputnik days, I alternate between 
hope and depression. Recently I 
have seen one hopeful sign, al- 
though it is a bit frightening. 

As 1 write this it appears that the 
Soviets have built lasers sufficiently 
powerful to blind our infra-red ob- 
servation satellites. These satellites 
are in very high orbits, meaning 
that the Soviet lasers must be ex- 
tremely powerful. One old friend 
who has remained in the industry 
told me at a New Year’s party that 
the Soviets must be at least 5 years 
ahead of us, and this in a field in 
which we thought we were su- 
preme. 

Why is this hopeful? Isn’t it 
rather frightening? 

It’s frightening if you think the 
Soviet Union may fall or be under 
the control of convinced ideologists 
willing to trade part of their country 
for all of the world. There is noth- 
ing in Marxist ideology to forbid 
that — indeed, any communist who 
has the opportunity to eliminate the 
West and thus bring about the world 
revolution, and who fails to do it 
l^cause of the price in human lives, 

guilty of bourgeois sentimental- 
'*y. So yes, it’s frightening that the 
Soviets may have taken several long 
strides toward laser defense against 
ICBM’s. 

It’s hopeful, though, in that it 

^ STEP FARTHER OUT 



may stimulate us to get moving in 
large laser R&D. In my judgment, 
defense technology is the ideal way 
to conduct an arms race, if you 
must have an arms race. (And it 
takes only one party to start a race, 
unfortunately.) Defense systems 
don’t threaten the opponent’s civi- 
lian population. They merely com- 
plicate offensive operations, hope- 
fully to the point where no sane 
person would launch an attack; and 
they give some hope that part of 
your own civilian population may 
survive if worst comes to worst. 

If we can’t justify space opera- 
tions in terms of benefits to man- 
kind, then perhaps we can sell them 
as defense systems? Big lasers can 
be used as space launching systems. 

If built they can put a good bit of 
material into orbit, thus making the 
manned space factory economically 
feasible and nearly inevitable; and 
once in Earth orbit, as 1 said in the 
first of these columns exactly two 
years ago,* you’re halfway to any- 
where. 

Specifically, we’d be halfway to 
an era of plenty without pollution; 
halfway to assuring that our descen- 
dents won’t curse our memory for = 
throwing away mankind’s hope for 
the stars. -k 



•This is the second anniversary of these 
columns and I’ve greatly enjoyed doing 
them. No one will ever take Willy Ley’s 
place, but I like to think he would have ap- 
proved.

HEXAPEDIA 



Four logs good? 
Six legs betterl 



BONNIE DALZELL 



1 HE OWL-GRYPHON in this month’s 
showcase is the graphical result of a 
pleasant conversation that I had 
with Galaxy’s Esteemed Editor at a 
science fiction convention during 
the winter of 1975. Esteemed Editor 
Baen and 1 were discussing the oc- 
curence of classical mythological 
themes in science fiction. He 
suggested that the composite crea- 
tures of ancient myths might be a 
source of inspiration for the 
multiple-limbed aliens encountered 
so frequently in contemporary sci- 
ence fiction. These aliens he noted, 
are usually built on a basically ver- 
tebrate body plan. 

I have long asserted that the only 
reason terrestrial vertebrates are lim- 
ited to four limbs is due to their 
common descent from fishes adapted 



to an open-ocean (pelagic) way of life. 
Vertebrates became excellent swim- 
mers using their tails as the organ of 
propulsion. An animal living in the 
open ocean with a rear propulsion sys- 
tem and a center of lift (the air bladder 
in bony fishes) located anteriorly 
needs only two sets of diving planes to 
control pitch and yaw. Had the ances- 
try of land vertebrates come from 
animals that had always been dwellers 
on the bottom, especially in the near- 
shore or fresh-water environments, 
we might well be hexa- , or more podal- 
Indeed, there once were fishes in 
the vertebrate nedigree with as 
many as ten sets of paired appen- 
dages: Figure One shows * 

Euthacanthus, a Devonian form 
with seven sets of paired fins. 
(Euthacanthus was one of the early 



68 




awed-fishes called Acanthodians 
that flourished during the early half 
of the Paleozoic.) 

Increased swimming efficiency as 
j cause for the reduction of the 
oaiied-fin count of modem fishes to 
the standard two sets is, I think, far 
superior to the claim (too often seen 
in sf-related articles) that a six- 
limbed vertebrate would encounter 
impossible problems of coordina- 
tion. Note that some insects 
coordinate — with little noticeable 
trouble to their mdimentary nervous 
systems — six limbs, four wings and 
many mouth parts. 

But while the efficiency argument 
may be a valid explanation of the 
general four-limbed vertebrate form, 
it does not, as it were, insist upon 
it. 

1 would expect six-limbed verte- 
brates to evolve in an alternate 
planetary environment in which 
there was little open ocean, and in 
which fishes were bottom-dwelling 
forms commonly found in near- 
shore and fresh-water environments. 
Perhaps the planet would also be 
highly seasonal, with massive 
periodical evaporation of shallow 
oceans so that few fishes would 
evolve into highly efficient 
swimmers — because the open ocean 
"'ould not exist for a large enough 
portion of the year to make it a prof- 
■table niche to occupy. In these 
eonditions we might well expect to 
the evolution of hexapedal land 
''ortebrates. Figure Two 
Once our land-dwelling vertebrate 



hexapods were well extablished we 
might also expect to see a 
phenomenon not uncommon even 
among quadruped vertebrates (i.e.> 
many reptiles, birds, and some 
mammals, such as yourselves); the 
specialization of the front set of 
limbs for purposes other than 
ground locomotion. 

In fact this evolutionary step 
would be much simpler for the 
hexapod; it would not have to 
evolve bipedal locomotion at the 
same time. Bipedalism requires a 
high degree of hind-leg engineering 
sophistication in the four-limbed 
form. (Compare the relative success 
of birds, which evolved bipedally 
first and then learned to fly, with 
bats, which never did acquire the 
trick of getting about on two legs.) 

And since converting from qua- 
drupedal to bipedal locomotion re- 
quires a much greater degree of 
anatomical and neural reorganiza- 
tion than would be the case in going 
from six legs to four, we would ex- 
pect to see many more cases of 
limb specialization in our hexapodal 
world. One animal could modify its 
middle set into wings (as in this 
month’s Showcase) and still have 
two sets left for running. Another 
could modify its front set for ma- 
nipulation and carrying — the first 
step toward tool use — and still re- 
main a fine runner. Indeed, the cen- 
tauroid form would probably be 
ubiquitous. 

A side issue: current theory has it 
that tool use accompanies or 



69 




perhaps even preceeds rather than 
l^lows the evolution of high intel- 
ligence; this leads to speculations 
concerning the possibility of many 
intelligent species evolving simul- 
taneously, as well as the possibility 
of intelligence evolving during an 
earlier period than it did on earth. 
But, again, a full discussion of this 
problem lies beyond the scope of 
this article. Perhaps 1 will have an 
opportunity to consider it at some 
ftiture date. Hint, hint. 

“Fascinating,” remarked Es- 
teemed Editor, breaking into my 
sixth non-stop paragraph (1 wax 
somewhat enthusiastic on the sub- 
ject of alternate lines of evolution. 
“That is why I would like to see an 
illustration of a gryphon stooping 
after prey with the proper number 
of limbs. A gryphon is, after all, 
six-limbed and it should, for the 
sake of consistency, be hunting a 
six-limbed creature.” 

In such ways are works of art in- 
spired. 

After the production of the illus- 
tration I began to ponder the fre- 
quency with which six-limbed 
heasts and beings occur in religious 
and mythical motifs. The predomi- 
nance of six-limbed forms is seen in 
legends and writings from the east- 
ern end of the Mediterranean. 
Amongst the beasts are: gryphons, 
hyppogryphs, the southern European 
dragon (the oriental dragon is wing- 
less, as are many of the dragons of 
northern European legend), the 
"ringed bulls and lions of Assyria, 

hexapedia 



Pegasus, Greek sphinxes, and cen- 
taurs. 

The winged beings include many 
deities and the typical angels and 
demons of Christianity. Some have 
argued that the angels illustrated 
with long trailing robes may have 
had only four limbs, the robes’ pur- 
pose being not to conceal the feet 
but the absence of feet. I have no 
hard facts with which to resolve this 
controversy. 

It should be noted that there are 
mythical beings with more than six 
limbs: Odin’s horse was eight- 
limbed, the Eskimos have both 
Quiquem (the eight-limbed hairless 
dog) and a ten- limbed polar bear; 
many hindu deities have a limb to 
hold each attribute (and since their 
attributes were prodigous in number 
so was the limb count); there is a 
nine-limbed horse in Hungarian 
legend, etc. However the occurence 
of animals and beings with limbs in 
excess of six is spotty and inconsis- 
tent compared to the occurence of 
six-limbed beings in the eastern 
Mediterranean. 

* * * 

After a sufficiency of ethyl al- 
cohol (Rolling Rock Beer, in fact) 
I was gripped by a blaze of over- 
whelming insight. These various six- 
limbed mythological figures must 
represent a verbal heritage from 
primitive humans who had contact 
with an entire six-limbed extrater- 
restrial fauna! Obviously sometime 

71 




in the Old Stone Age a group of hu- 
mans were removed from Earth for 
exhibition in the primatoid house 
at Galactric Central Zoo! This was 
an error on the part of the extrater- 
restrial collectors, for the humans 
were far more intelligent than their 
social system and parasite load 
would indicate. After a few genera- 
tions of “Terran apes” were raised 
in the zoo they had learned enough 
Intergalactic to beg for ‘‘bananas 
from Betelgeuse” and ‘‘jjeanuts from 
Sirius.” The ability to spontane- 
ously utilize a language, however 
crudely, as a tool to specifically ob- 
tain one’s wants is indicative of in- 
telligence above that of the beasts 
of the field. And so the highly ethi- 
cal intergalactic zoologists arranged 
for the immediate return of the en- 
tire Terran ape colony to their 
planet-of-origin. 

The Terrans were released some- 
where in the Arabian peninsula and 
thence originated not only language 
as a tool of human existence, but 
also the many myths of hexapodal 
deities and beasts. 

I have further support for this 
theory from my own personal expe- 
rience: back in the days when I was 
a crazy freshman all I wanted to do 
was be a paleontologist and dig up 
dinosaurs. 

I have since discovered that di- 
nosaurs are large, and that they are 
usually encased in limestone or in- 
durated sandstone — both hard rocks 
to crack — and that these rocks are 
generally located in the middle of 

72 



utter barreness and desolation, and 
that working with a small pick to 
free a 15 ton block of rock from the 
rest of said rock is hot tiring work! 
I now want to be the head paleon- 
tologist and direct while my assis- 
tants dig up dinosaurs. 

Anyway, the first step to becom- 
ing a paleontologist was enrollment 
in Paleontology 1 . Amongst the col- 
lection of fossils, casts of fossils, 
rocks, bones, shells, and models of 
animals long defunct that we 
studied in lab was a model of a fish 
ancestral to land animals — a 
Rhipidistian Crossopterygian de- 
picted in Figure Three. 

Only this model had three sets of 
paired fins; that is, it was a hexop- 
terygian fish (six finned). 

Although many of you will argue 
that it was only a model and that 
the artist probably made some mis- 
take in its construction, I contend 
that it is additional evidence that an 
alien intelligence has already con- 
tacted mankind. Perhaps the artist 
was (is?) an Alien Observer who, 
impoverished by an episode of 
purse-tightening at Galactic Central, 
was forced to earn his (her/its?) liv- 
ing off the land while in the field, 
so to speak, and made a perfectly 
natural mistake. 

Lest I be accused of attempting 
some crass commercial profit from 
this theory, a regrettable tendency of 
late, I hereby disown any future re- 
sponsibility for this idea and leave 
its fate to the wisdom of the mas- 
ses. ★

FIngal had a strong 
sense of identity— 
he was going to need it! 



It was schoolday at the Kenya 
disneyland. Five nine-year-olds 
were being shown around the 
medico section where Fingal lay on 
the recording table, the top of his 
skull removed, looking up into a 
mirror. Fingal was in a bad mood 
(hence the trip to the disneyland) 
and could have done without the 
children. Their teacher was doing 
his best, but who can control five 
nine-year-olds? 

74 



“What’s the big green wire do, 
teacher?” asked a little girl, reach- 
ing out one grubby hand and touch 
ing Fingal’ s brain where the main 
recording wire clamped to the 
built-in terminal. 

“Lupus, I told you you weren’t 
to touch anything. And look at you. 
you didn’t wash your hands.” The 
teacher took the child’s hand and 
pulled it away. 

“But what does it matter? You 
told us yesterday that the reason no 
one cares about dirt like they used 
to is dirt isn’t dirty anymore.” 

“I’m sure I didn’t tell yo“ 
exactly that. What I said was tha- 
when humans were forced of 
Earth, we took the golden opportu 
nity to wipe out all harmful genti* 

GALAX^ 



When there were only three 
thousand people alive on the moon 
after the Occupation it was easy for 
us to sterilize everything. So the 
medico doesn’t need to wear gloves 
like surgeons used to, or even wash 
her hands. There’s no danger of in- 
fection. But it isn’t polite. We don’t 
want this man to think we’re being 
impolite to him, just because his 
nervous system is disconnected and 
he can’t do anything about it, do 
we?” 

“No, teacher.” 

“What’s a surgeon?” 

“What’s ‘infection’?” 

Fingal wished the little perishers 
had chosen another day for their 
lessons, but like the teacher had 
Said, there was very little he could 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



do. The medico had turned his 
motor control over to the computer 
while she took the reading. He was 
paralyzed. He eyed the little boy 
carrying the carved stick, and hoped 
he didn’t get a notion to poke him 
in the cerebrum with it. Fingal was 
insured, but who needs the trouble? 

“All of you stand back a little so 
the medico can do her work. That’s 
better. Now, who can tell me what 
the big green wire is? Destry?” 

Destry allowed as how he didn’t 
know, didn’t care, and wished he 
could get out of here and play spat 
ball. The teacher dismissed him and 
went on with the others. 

“The green wire is the main 
sounding electrode,” the teacher 
said. “It’s attached to a series of 



75 





very fine wires in the man’s head, 
like the ones you have, which are 
implanted at birth. Can anyone tell 
me how the recording is made?” 

The little girl with the dirty hands 
spoke up. 

“By tying knots in string.” 

The teacher laughed, but the 
medico didn’t. She had heard it all 
before. So had the teacher, of 
course, but that was why he was a 
teacher. He had the patience to deal 
with children, a rare quality now 
that there were so few of them. 

“No, that was just an analogy. 
Can you all say analogy?” 
“Analogy,” they chorused. 

“Fine. What I told you is that the 
chains of FPNA are very much like 
strings with knots tied in them. If 
you make up a code with every mil- 
limeter and every knot having a 
meaning, you could write words in 
string by tying knots in it. That’s 
what the machine does with the 
FPNA. Now . can anyone tell 
me what FPNA stands for?” 

“Ferro-Photo-Nucleic Acid,’’ 
said the girl, who seemed to be the 
star pupil. 

“That’s right. Lupus. It’s a vari- 
ant on DNA, and it can be knotted 
by magnetic fields and light, and 
made to go through chemical 
changes. What the medico is doing 
now is threading long strings of 
FPNA into the tiny tubes that are in 
the man’s brain. When she’s done, 
she’ll switch on the machine and 
the current will start tying knots. 
And what happens then?” 

76 



“All his memories go into the 
memory cube,” said Lupus. 

“That’s right. But it’s a little 
more complicated than that. You 
remember what 1 told you about a 
divided cipher? The kind that has 
two parts, neither of which is any 
good without the other? Imagine 
two of the strings, each with a lot 
of knots in them. Well, you try to 
read one of them with your de- 
coder, and you find out that it 
doesn’t make sense. That’s because 
whoever wrote it used two strings, 
with knots tied in different places. 
They only make sense when you 
put them side-by-side and read them 
that way. That’s how this decoder 
works, but the medico uses twenty- 
five strings. When they’re all knot- 
ted the right way and put into the 
right openings in that cube over 
there,” he pointed to the pink cube 
in the medico’s bench, “they’ll con- 
tain all this man’s memories and 
personality. In a way, he’ll be in 
the cube, but he won’t know it, be- 
cause he’s going to be an african 
lion today.” 

This excited the children, who 
would much rather be stalking the 
Kenya savanna than listening to 
how a multi- holo was taken. When 
they quieted down the teacher went 
on, using analogies that got more 
strained by the minute. 

“When the strings are in . 
class, pay attention. When they’re 
in the cube, a current sets them in 
place. What we have then is a 
multi-holo. Can anyone tell me why 

GALAXY 




can’t just take a tape-recording 
q { what’s going on in this man’s 
brain, and use that?” 

One of the boys answered, for 
once. 

“Because memory isn’t . 
what’s that word?” 

“Sequential?” 

“Yeah, that’s it. His memories 
are stashed all over his brain and 
there’s no way to sort them out. So 
this recorder takes a picture of the 
whole thing at once, like a holo- 
gram. Does that mean you can cut 
the cube in half and have two 
people?” 

“No, but that’s a good question. 
This isn’t that sort of hologram. 
This is something like . like 
when you press your hand into clay, 
but in four dimensions. If you chip 
off a part of the clay after it’s dried, 
you lose part of the information, 
right? Well, this is sort of like that. 
You can’t see the imprint because 
it’s too small, but everything the 
man ever did and saw and heard 
and thought will be in the cube.” 

“Would you move back a little?” 
asked the medico. The children in 
the mirror over Fingal’s head shuf- 
fled back and became more than 
just heads with shoulders sticking 
out. The medico adjusted the last 
strand of FPNA suspended in his 
cortex to the close tolerances 
specified by the computer. 

“I’d like to be a medico when I 
grow up,” said one boy. 

“I thought you wanted to go to 
college and study to be a scientist.” 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



“Well, maybe. But my friend is 
teaching me to be a medico. It 
looks a lot easier.” 

“You should stay in school, Des- 
try. I’m sure y^ur parent will want 
you to make something of your- 
self.” The medico fumed silently. 
She knew better than to speak 
up — education was a serious busi- 
ness and interference with the duties 
of a teacher carried a stiff fine. But 
she was obviously pleased when the 
class thanked her and went out the 
door, leaving dirty footprints behind 
them. 

She viciously flipped a switch, 
and Fingal found he could breath 
and move the muscles in his head. 

“Lousy conceited college 
graduate,’’ she said. “What the 
hell’s wrong with getting your 
hands dirty, I ask you?” She wiped 
the blood from her hands onto her 
blue smock. 

“Teachers are the worst,” Fingal 
said. 

“Ain’t it the truth? Well, being a 
medico is nothing to be ashamed of. 
So I didn’t go to college, so what? 1 
can do my job, and 1 can see what 
I’ve done when I’m through. I al- 
ways did like working with my 
hands. Did you know that being a 
medico used to be one of the most 
respected professions there was?” 

“Really?” 

“Fact. They had to go to college 
for years and years, and they made 
a hell of a lot of money, let me tell 
you.” 

Fingal said nothing, thinking she 

77 




must be exaggerating. What was so 
tough about medicine? Just a little 
mechanical sense and a steady 
hand, that was all you needed. Fin- 
gal did a lot of maintenance on his 
body himself, going to the shop 
only for major work. And a good 
thing, at the prices they charged. It 
was not the sort of thing one dis- 
cussed while lying helpless on the 
table, however. 

“Okay, that’s done.” She pulled 
out the modules that contained the 
invisible FPNA and set them in the 
developing solution. She fastened 
Fingal’s skull back on and tightened 
the recessed screws set into the 
bone. She turned his motor control 
back over to him while she sealed 
his scalp back into place. He 
stretched and yawned. He always 
grew sleepy in the medico’s shop; 
he didn’t know why. 

“Will that be all for today, sir? 
We’ve got a special on blood 
changes, and since you’ll just be 
lying there while you’re out dop- 
pling in the park, you might as 
well . .” 

“No, thanks. I had it changed a 
year ago. Didn’t you read my his- 
tory?” 

She picked up the card and 
glanced at it. “So you did. Fine. 
You can get up now, Mr. Fingal.” 
She made a note on the card and set 
it down on the table. The door 
opened and a small face peered in. 

“I left my stick,” said the boy. 
He came in and started looking 
under things, to the annoyance of 

78 



the medico. She attempted to ignore 
the boy as she took down the rest of 
the information she needed. 

“And are you going to experi- 
ence this holiday now, or wait until 
your double has finished and play it 
back then?” 

“Huh? Oh, you mean . yes, I 
see. No, I’ll go right into the ani- 
mal. My psychist advised me to 
come out here for my nerves, so it 
wouldn’t do me much good to wait 
it out, would it?” 

“No, I suppose it wouldn’t. So 
you’ll be sleeping here while you 
dopple in the park. Hey!” She 
turned to confront the little boy, 
who was poking his nose into things 
he should stay away from. She 
grabbed him and pulled him away. 

“You either find what you’re 
looking for in one minute or you 
get out of here, you see?” He went 
back to his search, giggling behind 
his hand and looking for more in- 
teresting things to fool around with. 

The medico made a check on the 
card, glanced at the glowing num- 
bers on her thumbnail and discov- 
ered her shift was almost over. 
She connected the memory cube 
through a machine to a terminal in 
the back of his head. 

“You’ve never done this before, 
right? We do this to avoid blank 
spots, which can be confusing 
sometimes. The cube is almost set, 
but now I’ll add the last ten minutes 
to the record at the same time as I 
put you to sleep. That way you’ll 
experience no disorientation, you’ll 

GALAXY 




^ove through a dream state to full 
awareness of being in the body of a 
lion. Your body will be removed 
and taken to one of our slumber 
rooms while you’re gone. There’s 
nothing to worry about.” 

Fingal wasn’t worried, just tired 
and tense. He wished she would go 
on and do it and stop talking about 
it. And he wished the little boy 
would stop pounding his stick 
against the table leg. He wondered 
if his headache would be transferred 
to the lion. 

She turned him off. 

* * 

They hauled his body away and 
took his memory cube to the instal- 
lation room. The medico chased 
the boy into the corridor and hosed 
down the recording room. Then she 
was off to a date she was already 
late for. 

The employees of Kenya disney- 
land installed the cube into a metal 
box set into the skull of a full- 
grown African lioness. The social 
structure of lions being what it was, 
the proprietors charged a premium 
for the use of a male body, but Fin- 
gal didn’t care one way or the 
other. 

A short ride in an underground 
railroad with the sedated body of 
the Fingal-lioness, and he was de- 
posited beneath the blazing sun of 
the Kenya savanna. He awoke, snif- 
fed the air, and felt better im- 
mediately. 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEAAORY BANK 



The Kenya disneyland was a total 
environment buried twenty kilome- 
ters beneath Mare Moscoviense on 
the farside of Luna. It was roughly 
circular with a radius of two 
hundred kilometers. From the 
ground to the “sky” was two 
kilometers except over the full-sized 
replica of Kilimanjaro, where it 
bulged to allow clouds to form in a 
realistic manner over the snowcap. 

The illusion was flawless. The 
ground curved away consistent with 
the curvature of the Earth, so that 
the horizon was much more distant 
than anything Fingal was used to. 
The trees were real, and so were all 
the animals. At night an astronomer 
would have needed a spectroscope 
to distinguish the stars from the real 
thing. 

Fingal certainly couldn’t spot 
anything wrong. Not that he wanted 
to. The colors were strange but that 
was from the limitations of feline 
optics. Sounds were much more 
vivid, as were smells. If he’d 
thought about it, he would have 
realized the gravity was much too 
weak for Kenya. But he wasn’t 
thinking; he’d come here to avoid 
that necessity. 

It was hot and glorious. The dry 
grass made no sound as he walked 
over it on broad pads. He smelled 
antelope, wildebeest, and . was 
that baboon? He felt pangs of 
hunger but he really didn’t want to 
hunt. But he found the lioness body 
starting on a stalk anyway. 

Fingal was in an odd position. He 

79 




was in control of the lioness, but 
only more or less. He could guide 
her where he wanted to go, but he 
had no say at all over instinctive 
behaviors. He was as much a pawn 
to these as the lioness was. In one 
sense, he was the lioness; when he 
wished to raise a paw or turn 
around, he simply did it. The motor 
control was complete. It felt great 
to walk on all fours, and it came as 
easily as breathing. But the scent of 
the antelope went on a direct route 
from the nostrils to the lower brain, 
made a connection with the rum- 
blings of hunger, and started him on 
the stalk. 

The guidebook said to surrender 
to it. Fighting it wouldn’t do any- 
one any good, and could frustrate 
you. If you were paying to be a 
lion, read the chapter on “Things to 
Do,” you might as well be one, not 
just wear the body and see the 
sights. 

Fingal wasn’t sure he liked this 
as he came up downwind and 
crouched behind a withered clump 
of scrub. He pondered it while he 
sized up the dozen or so antelope 
grazing just a few meters from him, 
picking out the small, the weak, 
and the young with a predator’s 
eye. Maybe he should back out now 
and go on his way. These beautiful 
creatures were not harming him. 
The Fingal part of him wished 
mostly to admire them, not eat 
them. 

Before he quite knew what had 
happened, he was standing trium- 

80 



phant over the bloody body of 3 
small antelope. The others were ju^j 
dusty trails in the distance. 

It had been incredible! 

The lioness was fast, but might 
as well have been moving in 
slow-motion compared to the an- 
telope. Her only advantage lay in 
surprise, confusion, and quick, all- 
out attack. There had been the lift- 
ing of a head, ears had flicked to- 
ward the bush he was hiding in, and 
he had exploded. Ten seconds of 
furious exertion and he bit down on 
a soft throat, felt the blood gush 
and the dying kicks of the hind legs 
under his paws. He was breathing 
hard and the blood coursed through 
his veins. There was only one way 
to release the tension. 

He threw his head back and 
roared his bloodlust. 

* * * 

He’d had it with lions at the end 
of the weekend. It wasn’t worth it 
for the few minutes of exhiliration 
at the kill. It was a life of endless 
stalking, countless failures, then a 
pitiful stri-ec, ’ to gst a few bites for 
yourself from the kill you had 
made. He found to his chagrin that 
his lioness was very low in the 
dominance-order. When he got his 
kill back to the pride — he didn’t 
know why he had dragged it back 
but the lioness seemed to know — it 
was promptly stolen from him. 
He/she sat back helplessly and 
watched the dominant male take his 



GALAXY 




share, followed by the rest of the 
pride. He was left with a dried 
liaunch four hours later, and had to 
contest even that with vultures and 
hyenas. He saw what the premium 
payment was for. That male had it 
easy- 

But he had to admit that it had 
been worth it. He felt better; his 
psychist had been right. It did one 
good to leave the insatiable comput- 
ers at his office for a weekend of 
simple living. There were no com- 
plicated choices to be made out 
here. If he was in doubt, he listened 
to his instincts. It was just that the 
next time, he’d go as an elephant. 
He’d been watching them. All the 
other animals pretty much left them 
alone, and he could see why. To be 
a solitary bull, free to wander where 
he wished with food as close as the 
nearest tree branch . 

He was still thinking about it 
when the collection crew came for 
him. 

★ ★ ★ 

He awoke with the vague feeling 
that something was wrong. He sat 
up in bed and looked around him. 
Nothing seemed to be out of place. 
There was no one in the room with 
him. He shook his head to clear it. 

It didn’t do any good. There was 
still something wrong. He tried to 
remember how he had gotten there, 
and laughed at himself. His own 
bedroom! What was so remarkable 
about that? 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



But hadn’t there been a vacation, 
a week-end trip? He remembered 
being a lion, eating raw antelope 
meat, being pushed around within 
the pride, fighting it out with the 
other females and losing and retir- 
ing to rumble to him/herself. 

Certainly he should have come 
back to human consciousness in the 
disneyland medical section. He 
couldn’t remember it. He reached 
for his phone, not knowing who he 
wished to call. His psychist, 
perhaps, or the Kenya office. 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Fingal,’’ the 
phone told him. “This line is no 
longer available for outgoing calls. 
If you’ll ...” 

“Why not?” he asked, irritated 
and confused. “I paid my bill.” 

“That is of no concern to this 
department, Mr. Fingal. And please 
do not interrupt. It’s hard enough to 
reach you. I’m fading, but the mes- 
sage will be continued if you look 
to your right.” The voice and the 
power hum behind it faded. The 
phone was dead. 

Fingal looked to his right and 
jerked in surprise. There was a 
hand, a woman’s hand, writing on 
his wall. The hand faded out at the 
wrist. 

"Mene, Mene ...” it wrote, in 
thin letters of fire. Then the hand 
waved in irritation and erased that 
with its thumb. The wall was 
smudged with soot where the words 
had been. 

“You’re projecting, Mr. Fingal.” 
the hand wrote, quickly etching out 

81 




the words with a manicured nail. 
“That’s what you expected to see.” 
The hand underlined the word “ex- 
pected” three times. “Please coop- 
erate, clear your mind, and see 
what is there, or we’re not going to 
get anywhere. Damn, I’ve about 
exhausted this medium.” 

And indeed it had. The writing 
had filled the wall and the hand was 
now down near the floor. The ap- 
parition wrote smaller and smaller 
in an effort to get it all in. 

Fingal had an excellent grasp on 
reality, according to his psychist. 
He held tightly onto that evaluation 
like a talisman as he leaned closer 
to the wall to read the last sentence. 

“Look on your bookshelf,” the 
hand wrote. “The title is Orienta- 
tion in your Fantasy World. ’ ’ 

Fingal knew he had no such 
book, but could think of nothing 
better to do. 

His phone didn’t work, and if he 
was going through a psychotic y 
episode he didn’t think it wise to enter 
the public corridor until he had some 
idea of what was going on. The hand 
faded out, but the writing continued to 
smoulder. 

He found the book easily enough. 

It was a pamphlet, actually, with a 
gaudy cover. It was the sort of 
thing he had seen in the outer of- 
fices of the Kenya disneyland, a 
promotional booklet. At the bottom 
it said, “Published under the au- 
spices of the Kenya computer; A. 
Joachim, operator.” He opened it 
and began to read. 

82 



CHAPTER ONE 
“Where Am I?” 

You’re probably wondering 
by now where you are. This is 
an entirely healthy and normal 
reaction, Mr. Fingal. Anyone 
would wonder, when beset by 
what seem to be paranormal 
manifestations, if his grasp on 
reality had weakened. Or, in 
simple language, “Am I nuts, 
or what?" 

No, Mr. Fingal, you are not 
nuts. But you are not, as you 
probably think, sitting on your 
bed, reading a book. Ifs all in 
your mind. You are still in the 
Kenya disneyland. More 
specifically, you are contained 
in the memory cube we took of 
you before your weekend on 
the savanna. You see, there’s 
been a big goof-up. 

CHAPTER TWO 
“What Happened?" 

We’d like to know that, too, 
Mr. Fingal. But here’s what we 
do know. Your body has been 
misplaced. Now, there’s no- 
thing to worry about, we’re 
doing ali we can to locate it 
and find out how it happened 
but it will take some time. 
Maybe it’s small consolation, 
but this has never happened 
before in the seventy-five 
years we’ve been operating, 
and as soon as we find out 
how It happened this time, you 
can be sure we’ll be careful 
not to let it happen again. 
We’re pursuing several leads 
at this time, and you can rest 
easy that your body will be 

galaxy 




returned to you intact just as 
soon as we locate it. 

You are awake and aware 
right now because we have 
incorporated your memory 
cube into the workings of our 
H-210 computer, one of the 
finest holo-memory systems 
available to modern business. 

You see, there are a few 
problems. 

CHAPTER THREE 

"What Problems?" 

It’s kind of hard to put in 
terms you’d understand, but 
let’s take a crack at it, shall 
we? 

The medium we use to re- 
cord your memories isn’t the 
one you’ve probably used 
yourself as insurance against 
accidental death. As you must 
know, that system will store 
your memories for up to twenty 
years with no degradation or 
loss of information, and is quite 
expensive. The system we use 
is a temporary one, good for 
two, five, fourteen, or twenty- 
eight days, depending on the 
length of your stay. Your 
memories are put in the cube, 
where you might expect them 
to remain static and un- 
changing, like they do in your 
insurance-recording. If you 
thought that, you would be 
wrong, Mr. Fingal. Think about 
it. If you die, your bank will 
immediately start a clone from 
the plasm you stored along 
with the memory cube. In six 
months, your memories would 
be played back into the clone 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



and you would awaken, mis- 
sing the memories that were 
accumulated in your body from 
the time of your last recording. 
Perhaps this has happened to 
you. If it has, you know the 
shock of wakening from the 
recording process to be told 
that it is three or four years 
later, and that you died in that 
time. 

In any case, the process we 
use is an ongoing one, or it 
would be worthless to you. The 
cube we install in the African 
animal of your choice is capa- 
ble of adding the memories of 
your stay in Kenya to the 
memory cube. When your visit 
is over, these memories are 
played back into your brain 
and you leave the disneyland 
with the exciting, educational, 
and refreshing experiences 
you had as an animal, though 
your body never left our 
slumber room. This is known 
as “doppling,” from the Ger- 
man doppelganger. 

Now, to the problems we 
talked about. Thought we’d 
never get around to them, 
didn’t you? 

First, since you registered 
for a week-end stay, the 
medico naturally used one of 
the two-day cubes as part of 
our budget-excursion fare. 
These cubes have a safety 
factor, but aren’t much good 
beyond three days at best. At 
the end of that time the cube 
would start to deteriorate. Of 
course, we fully expect to have 
you installed in your own body 




before then. Additionally, there 
is the problem of storage. 
Since these ongoing memory 
cubes are intended to be in 
use all the time your memories 
are stored in them, it presents 
certain problems when we find 
ourselves in the spot we are 
now in. Are you following me, 
Mr. Fingal? While the cube has 
already passed its potency for 
use in co-existing with a live 
host, like the lioness you just 
left, it must be kept in constant 
activation at all times or loss of 
information results. I'm sure 
you wouldn’t want that to 
happen, would you? Of course 
not. So what we have done is 
to "plug you in” to our 
computer, which will keep you 
aware and healthy and guard 
against the randomizing of 
your memory nexi. I won’t go 
into that; let it stand that 
randomizing is not the sort of 
thing you’d like to have happen 
to you. 

CHAPTER FOUR 
“So What Gives, Huh?” 

I'm glad you asked that. 
(Because you did ask that, Mr. 
Fingal. This booklet is part of 
the analogizing process that I’ll 
explain further down the page.) 

Life in a computer is not the 
sort of thing you could just 
jump Into and hope to retain 
the world-picture-compatibility 
so necessary for sane func- 
tioning in this complex society. 
This has been tried, so take 
our word for it. Or rather, my 
word. Did I introduce myself? 



I’m Apollonia Joachim, First 
Class Operative for the 
DataSafe computer trouble- 
shooting firm. You’ve probably 
never heard of us, even 
though you do work with 
computers. 

Since you can’t just come 
aware in the baffling, on-and- 
off world that passes for reality 
in a data system, your mind, in 
cooperation with an analogiz- 
ing program I’ve given the 
computer, interprets things in 
ways that seem safe and 
comfortable to it. The world 
you see around you Is a 
figment of your imagination. Of 
course, it looks real to you 
because it comes from the 
same part of the mind that you 
normally use to interpret reali- 
ty. If we wanted to get 
philosophical about it, we could 
probably argue all day about 
what constitutes reality and 
why the one you are perceiv- 
ing now is any less real than 
the one you are used to. But 
let’s not get into that, all right? 

The world will likely continue 
to function in ways you are 
accustomed for it to function. It 
won’t be exactly the same. 
Nightmares, for instance. Mr. 
Fingal, I hope you aren’t the 
nervous type, because your 
nightmares can come to life 
where you are. They’ll seem 
quite real. You should avoid 
them if you can, because they 
can do you real harm. I’ll say 
more about this later if I need 
to. For now, there’s no need to 
worry.

CHAPTER FIVE 

"What Do I Do Now?” 

I'd advise you to continue 
with your normal activities. 

Don’t be alarmed at anything 
unusual. For one thing, I can 
only communicate with you by 
means of paranormal 
phenomena. You see, when a 
message from me is fed into 
the computer it reaches you in 
a way your brain is not capa- 
ble of dealing with. Naturally, 
your brain classifies this as an 
unusual event and fleshes the 
communication out in unusual 
fashion. Most of the weird 
things you see, if you stay 
calm and don’t let your own 
fears out of the closet to 
persecute you, will be me. 
Otherwise, I anticipate that 
your world should look, feel, 
taste, sound, and smell pretty 
normal. I’ve talked to your 
psychist. He assures me that 
your world-grasp is strong. So 
sit tight. We’ll be working hard 
to get you out of there. 

CHAPTER SIX 
“Help!” 

Yes, we’ll help you. This is a 
truly unfortunate thing to have 
happened, and of course we 
will refund all your money 
promptly. In addition, the 
lawyer for Kenya wants me to 
ask you if a lump sum set- 
tlement against all future 
damages is a topic worthy of 
discussion. You can think 
about it, there’s no hurry. 

In the meantime. I’ll find 
ways to answer your ques- 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



tions. It might become un- 
wieldy the harder your mind 
struggles to normalize my 
communications into things 
you are familiar with. That is 
both your greatest strength — 
the ability of your mind to bend 
the computer world it doesn’t 
wish to see into media you are 
familiar with — and my biggest 
handicap. Look for me in tea- 
leaves, on billboards, on 
holovision; anywhere! It could 
be exciting if you get into it. 

Meanwhile, if you have 
received this message you can 
talk to me by filling in the 
attached coupon and dropping 
it in the mailtube. Your reply 
will probably be waiting for you 
at the office. Good luck! 



Yes! I received your message, and 
am interested in the exciting oppor- 
tunities in the field of computer liv- 
ing] Please send me, without cost or 
obligation, your exciting catalog tell- 
ing me how I can move up to the 
big, wonderful world outside! 

NAME 

ADDRESS 

I.D 

Fingal fought the urge to pinch 
himself. If what this booklet said 
was true — and he might as well be- 
lieve it — it would hurt and he would 
not wake up. He pinched himself 
anyway. It hurt. 

If he understood this right, every- 
thing around him was the product of 
his imagination. Somewhere, a 
woman was sitting at a computer 
input and talking to him in normal 

85 




language, which came to his brain 
in the form of electron pulses it 
could not cope with and so edited 
into forms he was conversant with. 
He was analogizing like mad. He 
wondered if he had caught it from 
the teacher, if analogies were con- 
tagious. 

■ “What the hell’s wrong with a 
simple voice from the air?’’ he 
wondered aloud. He got no re- 
sponse, and was rather glad. He’d 
had enough mysteriousness for now. 
And on second thought, a voice 
from the air would probably scare 
the pants off him. 

He decided his brain must know 
what it was doing. After all, the 
hand startled him but he hadn’t 
panicked. He could see it, and he 
trusted his visual sense more than 
he did voices from the air, a classi- 
cal sign of insanity if ever there was 
one. 

He got up and went to the wall. 
The letters of fire were gone, but 
the black smudge of the erasure was 
still there. He sniffed it: carbon. He 
fingered the rough paper of the 
pamphlet, tore off a comer, put it 
in his mouth and chewed it. It 
tasted like paper. 

He sat down and filled out the 
coupon and tossed it to the mail- 
tube. 

Fingal didn’t get angry about it 
until he was at the office. He was 
an easy-going person, slow to boil. 
But he finally reached a point where 
he had to say something. 

Everything had been so normal 

86 



he wanted to laugh. All his friends 
and acquaintances were there, doing 
exactly what he would have ex- 
pected them to be doing. What 
amazed and bemused him was the 
number and variety of spear- 
carriers, minor players in this inter- 
nal soap-opera. The extras that his 
mind had cooked up to people the 
crowded corridors; like the man he 
didn’t know who had bumped into 
him on the tube to work, 
apologized, and disappeared, pre- 
sumably back into the bowels of his 
imagination. 

There was nothing he could do to 
vent his anger but test the whole 
absurd set-up. There was doubt lin- 
gering in his mind that the whole 
morning had been a fugue, a tempo- 
rary lapse into dreamland. Maybe 
he’d never gone to Kenya, after all, 
and his mind was playing tricks on 
him. To get him there, or keep him 
away? He didn’t know, but he 
could worry about that if the test 
failed. 

He stood up at his desk-terminal, 
which was in the third column of 
the fifteenth row of other identical 
desks, each with its diligent worker. 
He held up his hands and whistled. 
Everyone looked up. 

“I don’t believe in you,’’ he 
screeched. He picked up a stack of 
tapes on his desk and hurled them 
at Felicia Nahum at the desk next to 
his. Felicia was a good friend of 
his, and she registered the proper 
shock until the tapes hit her. Then 
she melted. He looked around the 

GALAXY; 




room and saw that everything had 
stopped like a freeze-frame in a mo- 
tion picture. 

He sat down and drummed his 
fingers on his desk top. His heart 
was pounding and his face was 
flushed. For an awful moment he 
had thought he was wrong. He 
began to calm down, glancing up 
every few seconds to be sure the 
world really had stopped. 

In three minutes he was in a cold 
sweat. What the hell had he 
proved! That this morning had been 
real, or that he really was crazy? It 
dawned on him that he would never 
be able to test the assumptions 
under which he lived. A line of 
print flashed across his terminal. 

“But when could you ever do so, 
Mr. Fingal?” 

“Ms. Joachim?” he shouted, 
looking around him. “Where are 
you? I’m afraid.” 

“You mustn’t be,” the terminal 
printed. “Calm yourself. You have 
a strong sense of reality, remember? 
Think about this: even before today, 
how could you be sure the world 
you saw was not the result of 
catatonic delusions? Do you see 
what I mean? The question ‘What is 
reality?’ is, in the end, unanswera- 
ble. We all must accept at some 
point what we see and are told, and 
live by a set of untested and untest- 
able assumptions. 1 ask you to ac- 
cept the set I gave you this morning 
because, sitting here in the compu- 
ter room where you cannot see me, 
my world-picture tells me that they 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



are the true set. On the other hand, 
you could believe that I’m deluding 
myself, that there’s nothing in the 
pink cube I see and that you’re a 
spear-carrier in my dream. Does that 
make you more comfortable?” 

“No,” he mumbled, ashamed of 
himself. “I see what you mean. 
Even if I am crazy, it would be 
more comfortable to go along with 
it than to keep fighting it.” 

“Perfect, Mr. Fingal. If you need 
further illustrations you could im- 
agine yourself locked in a strait- 
jacket. Perhaps there are technicians 
laboring right now to correct your 
condition, and they are putting you 
through this psycho-drama as a first 
step. Is that any more attractive?” 
“No, I guess it isn’t.” 

“The point is that it’s as reason- 
able an assumption as the set of 
facts 1 gave you this morning. But 
the main point is that you should 
behave the same if either set is true. 
Do you see? To fight it in the one 
case will only cause you trouble, 
and in the other, would impede the 
treatment. I realize I’m asking you 
to accept me on faith. And that’s all 
I can give you.” 

“I believe in you,” he said. 
“Now, can you start everything 
going again?” 

“I told you I’m not in control of 
your world. In fact, it’s a consider- 
able obstacle to me, seeing as I 
have to talk to you in these awk- 
ward ways. But things should get 
going on their own as soon as you 
let them. Look up. 

87 




He did, and saw the normal hum 
and bustle of the office. Felicia was 
there at her desk, as though nothing 
had happened. Nothing had. Yes, 
something had, after all. The tapes 
were scattered on the floor near his 
desk, where they had fallen. They 
had unreeled in an unruly mess. 

He started to pick them up, then 
saw they weren’t as messy as he 
had thought. They spelled out a 
message in coils of tape. 

“You’re back on the track,” it 
said. 

* * ★ 

For three weeks Fingal was a 
very good boy. His co-workers, had 
they been real people, might have 
noticed a certain standoffishness in 
him, and his social life at home was 
drastically curtailed. Otherwise, he 
behaved exactly as if everything 
around him were real. 

But his patience had limits. This 
had already dragged on far beyond 
what he had expected of it. He 
began to fidget at his desk, let his 
mind wander. Feeding information 
into a computer can be frustrating, 
unrewarding, and eventually stul- 
tifying. He had been feeling it even 
before his trip to Kenya; it had been 
the cause of his trip to Kenya. He 
was sixty-eight years old, with cen- 
turies ahead of him, and stuck in a 
ferro-magnetic rut. Longlife could 
be a mixed blessing when you felt 
boredom creeping up on you. 

What was getting to him was the 
growing disgust with his job. It was 

88 



bad enough when he merely sat in a 
real office with two hundred real 
people shoveling slightly unreal data 
into a much-less-than-real-to-his- 
senses computer. How much worse 
now, when he knew that the data he 
handled had no meaning to anyone 
but himself, was nothing but occu- 
pational therapy created by his mind 
and a computer program to keep 
him busy while Joachim searched 
for his body? 

For the first time in his life he 
began punching some buttons for 
himself. Under slightly less stress 
he would have gone to see his 
psychist, the approved and perfectly 
normal thing to do. Here, he knew 
he would only be talking to himself. 
He failed to perceive the advantages 
of such an idealized psychoanlytic 
process; he’d never really believed 
that a psychist did little but listen in 
the first place. 

He began to change his own life 
when he became irritated with his 
boss. She pointed out to him that 
his error-index was on the rise, and 
suggested that he shape up or begin 
looking for another source of 
employment. 

This enraged him. He’d been a 
good worker for twenty-five years. 
Why should she take that attitude 
when he was just not feeling him- 
self for a week or two? 

Then he was angrier than ever 
when he thought about her being 
merely a projection of his own 
mind. Why should he let her push 
him around?

“I don’t want to hear it,” he 
said. ‘‘Leave me alone. Better yet, 
give me a raise in salary.” 

“Fingal,” she said promptly, 
“you’ve been a credit to your sec- 
lion these last weeks. I’m going to 
give you a raise.” 

‘Thank you. Go away.” She did, 
by dissolving into thin air. This re- 
ally made his day. He leaned back 
in his chair and and thought about 
his situation for the first time since 
he was young. 

He didn’t like what he saw. 

In the middle of his ruminations, 
his computer screen lit up again. 

‘‘Watch it, Fingal,” it read. 
‘‘That way lies catatonia.” 

He took the warning seriously, 
but didn’t intend to abuse the new- 
found power. He didn’t see why 
judicious use of it now and then 
would hurt anything. He stretched, 
and yawned broadly. He looked 
around, suddenly hated the office 
with its rows of workers indistin- 
guishable from their desks. Why not 
take the day off? 

On impulse, he got up and 
walked the few steps to Felicia’s 
desk. 

‘‘Why don’t we go to my house 
and make love?” he asked her. 

She looked at him in astonish- 
ment, and he grinned. She was al- 
most as surprised as when he had 
hurled the tapes at her. 

‘‘Is this a joke? In the middle of 
the day? You have a job to do, you 
know. You want to get us fired?” 

He shook his head slowly. 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



‘‘That’s not an acceptable answer.” 
She stopped, and rewound from 
that point. He heard her repeat her 
last sentences backwards, then she 
smiled. 

“Sure, why not?” she said. 
Felicia left afterwards in the 
same, slightly disconcerting way his 
boss had left earlier; by melting into 
the air. Fingal sat quietly in his 
bed, wondering what to do with 
himself. He felt he was getting off 
to a bad start if he intended to edit 
his world with care. 

His telephone rang. 

‘‘You’re damn right,” said a 
woman’s voice, obviously irritated 
with him. He sat up straight. 
“Apollonia?” 

‘‘Ms. Joachim to you, Fingal. I 
can’t talk long, this is quite a strain 
on me. But listen to me, and listen 
hard. Your navel is very deep, Fin- 
gal. From where you’re standing, 
it’s a pit I can’t even see the bottom 
of. If you fall into it I can’t guaran- 
tee to pull you out.” 

‘‘But do I have to take everything 
as it is? Aren’t I allowed some 
self-improvement?’ ’ 

‘‘Don’t kid yourself. That wasn’t 
self-improvement. That was sheer 
laziness. It was nothing but mastur- 
bation, and while there’s nothing 
wrong with that, if you do it to the 
exclusion of all else your mind will 
grow in on itself. You’re in grave 
danger of excluding the external 
universe from your reality.” 

‘‘But I thought there was no ex- 
ternal universe for me here.” 

89 




“Almost right. But I’m feeding 
you external stimuli to keep you go- 
ing. Besides, it’s the attitude that 
counts. You’ve never had trouble 
finding sexual partners; why do you 
feel compelled to alter the odds 
now?’’ 

“I don’t know,’’ he admitted. 
“Like you said, laziness, I guess.’’ 

“That’s right. If you want to quit 
your job, feel free. If you’re serious 
about self-improvement, there are 
opportunities available to you there. 
Search them out. Look around you, 
explore. But don’t try to meddle in 
things you don’t understand. I’ve 
got to go now. I’ll write you a letter 
if I can, and explain more.’’ 

“Wait! What about my body? 
Have they made any progress?’’ 

“Yes, they’ve found out how it 
happened. It seems ...” her voice 
faded out, and he switched off the 
phone. 

The next day he received a letter 
explaining what was known so far. 
It seemed that the mix-up had re- 
sulted from the visit of the teacher 
to the medico section on the day of 
his recording. More specifically, the 
return of the little boy after the 
others had left. They were sure now 
that he had tampered with the 
routine card that told the attendants 
what to do with FingaTs body. In- 
stead of moving it to the slumber 
room, which was a green card, they 
had sent it somewhere — no one 
knew where yet — for a sex change, 
which was a blue card. The medico, 
in her haste to get home for her 
90 



date, had not noticed the switch 
Now the body could be in any of 
several thousand medico shops in 
Luna. They were looking for it, and 
for the boy. 

Fingal put the letter down and did 
some hard thinking. 

Joachim had said there were op- 
portunities for him in the memory 
banks. She had also said that not 
everything he saw was his own pro- 
jections. He was receiving, was 
capable of receiving, external 
stimuli. Why was that? Because he 
would tend to randomize without 
them, or some other reason? He 
wished the letter had gone into that. 

In the meantime, what did he do? 

Suddenly he had it. He wanted to 
learn about computers. He wanted 
to know what made them tick, to 
feel a sense of power over them. It 
was particularly strong when he 
thought about being a virtual pris- 
oner inside one. He was like a 
worker on an assembly line. All day 
long he labors, taking small parts 
off a moving belt and installing 
them on larger assemblies. One 
day, he happens to wonder who 
puts the parts on the belt? Where do 
they come from? How are they 
made? What happens after he in- 
stalls them? 

He wondered why he hadn’t 
thought of it before.

The admissions office of the

^^,as crowded. He was handed a 
form and told to fill it out. It looked 
bleak. The spaces for “previous -ex- 
perience” and “aptitude scores” 
^vere almost blank when he was 
through with them. All in all, not a 
very promising application. He went 
to the desk and handed the form to 
the man sitting at the terminal. 

The man fed it into the computer, 
which promptly decided Fingal had 
no talent for being a computer re- 
pairperson. He started to turn away, 
when his eye was caught by a large 
poster behind the man. It had been 
there on the wall when he came in, 
but he hadn’t read it. 

LUNA NEEDS 
COMPUTER TECHNICIANS 
THIS MEANS YOU, 

MR. FINGAL! 

Are you dissatisfied with 
your present employment? 

Do you feel you were cut out 
for better things? Then today 
may be your lucky day. 
You’ve come to the right 
place, and if you grasp this 
golden opportunity you will 
find doors opening that were 
closed to you. 

Act, Mr. Fingal. This is the 
time. Who's to check up on 
you? Just take that stylus 
and fill it in any old way you 
want. Be grandiose, be 
daring! The fix is in, and 
you’re on your way to 
BIG MONEY! 

The secretary saw nothing un- 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



usual about Fingal coming to the 
desk a second time, and didn’t even 
blink when the computer decided he 
was eligible for the accelerated 
course. 

★ ★ ★ 

It wasn’t easy at first. He really 
did have little aptitude for elec- 
tronics, but aptitude is a slippery 
thing. His personality matrix was as 
flexible now as it would ever be. A 
little effort at the right time would 
go a long way toward self- 
improvement. What he kept telling 
himself was that everything that 
made him what he was was etched 
in that tiny cube wired in to the 
computer, and if he. was careful he 
could edit it. 

Not radically, Joachim told him 
in a long, helpful letter later in the 
week. That way led to complete 
disruption of the FPNA matrix and 
catatonia, which in this case would 
be distinguishable from death only 
to a hair-splitter. 

He thought a lot about death as 
he dug into the books. He was in a 
strange position. The being known 
as Fingal would not die in any con- 
ceivable outcome of this adventure. 
For one thing, his body was going 
toward a sex change and it was hard to 
imagine what could happen to it 
that would kill it. Whoever had cus- 
tody of it now would be taking care 
of it just as well as the medicos in 
the slumber room would have. If 
Joachim was unsuccessful in her at- 
tempt to keep him aware and sane 

91 




in the memory bank, he would 
merely awake and remember noth- 
ing from the time he fell asleep 
on the table. 

If, by some compounded unlikli- 
hood, his body was allowed to die, 
he had an insurance recording safe 
in the vault of his bank. The record- 
ing was three years old. He would 
awaken in the newly-grown clone 
body knowing nothing of the last 
three years, and would have a fan- 
tastic story to listen to as he was 
brought up to date. 

But none of that mattered to him. 
Humans are a time-binding species, 
existing in an eternal now. The fu- 
ture flows through them and be- 
comes the past, but it is always the 
present that counts. The Fingal of 
three years ago was not the Fingal 
in the memory bank. The simple 
fact about immortality by memory 
recording was that it was a poor 
solution. The three-dimensional 
cross-section that was the Fingal of 
now must always behave as if his 
life depended on his actions, for he 
would feel the pain of death if it 
happened to him. It was small con- 
solation to a dying man to know 
that he would go on, several years 
younger and less wise. If Fingal lost 
out here, he would die, because 
with memory recording he was 
three people: the one who lived 
now, the one lost somewhere on 
Luna, and the one potential person 
in the bank vault. They were really 
no more than close relatives. 

Everyone knew this, but it was so 

92 



much better than the alternative that 
few people rejected it. They tried 
not to think about it and were gen- 
erally successful. They had record- 
ings made as often as they could af- 
ford them. They heaved a sigh of 
relief as they got onto the table to 
have another recording taken, know- 
ing that another chunk of their lives 
was safe for all time. But they 
awaited the awakening nervously, 
dreading being told that it was now 
twenty years later because they had 
died sometime after the recording 
and had to start all over. A lot can 
happen in twenty years. The person 
in the new clone body might have 
to cope with a child he or she had 
never seen, a new spouse, or the 
shattering news that his or her 
employment was now the function 
of a machine. 

So Fingal took Joachim’s warn- 
ings seriously. Death was death, 
and though he could cheat it, death 
still had the last laugh. Instead of 
taking your whole life from you, 
death now only claimed a percen- 
tage, but in many ways it was the 
most important percentage. 

He enrolled in classes. Whenever 
possible he took the ones that were 
available over the phone lines so he 
needn’t stir from his room. He or- 
dered his food and supplies by 
phone and paid his bills by looking 
at them and willing them out of 
existence. It could have been in- 
tensely boring, or it could have 
been wildly interesting. After all, 
was a dream-world, and who 

GALAXV 




doesn’t think of retiring into fantasy 
from time to time? Fingal certainly 
did, but firmly suppressed the idea 
^hen it came. He intended to get 
out of this dream. 

For one thing, he missed the 
company of other people. He waited 
for the weekly letters from Apol- 
lonia (she now allowed him to call 
her by her first name) with a com- 
suming passion and devoured every 
word. His file of such letters 
bulged. At lonely moments he 
would pull one out at random and 
read it again and again. 

On her advice, he left the apart- 
ment regularly and stirred around 
more or less at random. During 
these outings he had wild adven- 
tures. Literally. Apollonia hurled 
the external stimuli at him during 
these times and they could be any- 
thing from The Mummy’s Curse to 
Custer’s Last Stand with the origi- 
nal cast. It beat hell out of the 
movies. He would just walk down 
the public corridors and open a door 
at random. Behind it might be King 
Solomon’s mines or the sultan’s 
harem. He endured them all sto- 
ically. He was unable to get any 
pleasure from sex. He knew it was 
a one-handed exercise, and it took 
all the excitement away. 

His only pleasure came in his 
studies. He read everything he 
could about computer science and 
came to stand at the head of his 
class. And as he learned, it began 
to occur to him to apply his know- 
ledge to his own situation. 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



He began seeing things around 
him that had been veiled before. 
Patterns. The reality was starting to 
seep through his illusions. Every so 
often he would look up and see the 
faintest shadow of the real world of 
electron flow and fluttering circuits 
he inhabited. It scared him at first. 
He asked Apollonia about it on one 
of his dream journeys, this time to 
Coney Island in the mid-twentieth 
century. He liked it there. He could 
lay on the sand and talk to the surf. 
Overhead, a skywriter’s plane spel- 
led out the answers to his questions. 
He studiously ignored the bron- 
tosaurus rampaging through the rol- 
ler coaster off to his right. 

“What does it mean, O Goddess 
of Transistoria, when I begin to see 
circuit diagrams on the walls of my 
apartment? Overwork?’’ 

“It means the illusion is begin- 
ning to wear thin,’’ the plane spel- 
led out over the next half-hour. 
“You’re adapting to the reality you 
have been denying. It could be 
trouble, but we’re hot on the trail of 
your body. We should have it soon 
and get you out of there.’’ This had 
been too much for the plane. The 
sun was going down now, the bron- 
tosaurus vanished, and the plane ran 
out of gas. It spiraled into the ocean 
and the crowds surged closer to the 
water to watch the rescue. Fingal 
got up and went back to the 
boardwalk. 

There was a huge billboard. He 
laced his fingers behind his back 
and read it.

“Sorry for the delay. As I was 
saying, we’re almost there. Give us 
another few months. One of our 
agents thinks he will be at the right 
medico shop in about one week’s 
time. From there it should go 
quickly. For now, avoid those 
places where you see the circuits 
showing through. They’re no good 
for you, take my word for it.” 

Fingal avoided the circuits as 
long as he could. He finished his 
first courses in computer science 
and enrolled in the intermediate sec- 
tion. Six months rolled by. 

His studies got easier and easier. 
His reading speed was increasing 
phenomenally. He found that it was 
more advantageous for him to see 
the library as composed of books 
instead of tapes. He could take a 
book from the shelf, flip through it 
rapidly, and know everything that 
was in it. He knew enough now to 
realize that he was acquiring a facil- 
ity to interface directly with the 
stored knowledge in the computer, 
bypassing his senses entirely. The 
books he held in his hands were 
merely the sensual analogs of the 
proper terminals to touch. Apollonia 
was nervous about it, but let him go 
on. He breezed through the inter- 
mediate and graduated into the ad- 
vanced classes. 

But he was surrounded by wires. 
Everywhere he turned, in the pat- 
terns of veins beneath the surface of 
a man’s face, in a plate of french 
fries he ordered for lunch, in his 
palmprints, overlaying the apparent 

94 



disorder of a head of blonde hair on 
the pillow beside him. 

The wires were analogs of 
analogs. There was little in a mod- 
ern computer that consisted of wir- 
ing. Most of it was made of 
molecular circuits that were either 
embedded in a crystal lattice or 
photographically reproduced on a 
chip of silicon. Visually, they were 
hard to imagine, so his mind was 
making up these complex circuit 
diagrams that served the same pur- 
pose but could be experienced di- 
rectly. 

One day he could resist it no 
longer. He was in the bathroom, on 
the traditional place for the ponder- 
ing of the imponderable. His mind 
wandered, speculating on the neces- 
sity of moving his bowels, wonder- 
ing if he might safely eliminate the 
need to eliminate. His toe idly 
traced out the pathways of a circuit 
board incorporated in the pattern of 
tiles on the floor. 

The toilet began to overflow, not 
with water, but with coins. Bells 
were ringing happily. He jumped up 
and watched in bemusement as his 
bathroom filled with money. 

He became aware of a subtle al- 
teration in the tone of the bells. 
They changed from the merry clang 
of Jackpot to the tolling of a death 
knell. He hastily looked around for 
a manifestation. He knew that Apol- 
lonia would be angry. 

She was. Her hand appeared afld 
began to write on the wall. This 
time the writing was in his blood. B 

galaxv 




gripped menacingly from the words. 

“What are you doing?” the hand 
^yrote, and having writ, moved on. 

“1 told you to leave the wires 
alone. Do you know what you’ve 
done? You may have wiped the fi- 
nancial records for Kenya. It could 
take months to straighten them 
out.” 

“Well what do I care?” he 
exploded. “What have they done 
for me lately? It’s incredible that 
they haven’t located my body by 
now. It’s been a full year. ” 

The hand was bunched up in a 
fist. Then it grabbed him around the 
throat and squeezed hard enough to 
make his eyes bulge out. It slowly 
relaxed. When Fingal could see 
straight, he backed warily away 
from it. 

The hand fidgeted nervously, 
drummed its fingers on the floor. It 
went to the wall again. 

“Sorry,” it wrote, “I guess I’m 
getting tired. Hold on.” 

He waited, more shaken than he 
remembered being since his odyssey 
began. There’s nothing like a dose 
of pain, he reflected, to make you 
realize that it can happen to you. 

The wall with the words of blood 
slowly dissolved into a heavenly 
panorama. As he watched, clouds 
streamed by his vantage point and 
'ttixed beautifully with golden rays 
of sunshine. He heard organ music 
from pipes the size of sequoias. 

He wanted to applaud. It was so 
os'erdone, and yet so convincing. In 
’*>0 center of the whirling mass of 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEAAORY BANK 



white mist an angel faded in. She 
had wings and a halo, but lacked 
the traditional white robe. She was 
nude, and hair floated around her as 
if she were underwater. 

She levitated to him, walking on 
the billowing clouds, and handed 
him two stone tablets. He tore his 
eyes away from the apparition and 
glanced down at the tablets: 

Thou shah not screw around with 
things you do not understand. 

“All right, I promise I won’t,” 
he told the angel. “Apollonia, is 
that you? Really you, I mean?” 
“Read the Commandments, Fin- 
gal. This is hard on me.” 

He looked back at the tablets. 

Thou shalt not meddle in the 
hardware systems of the Kenya 
Corporation, for Kenya shall not 
hold him idemnifiable who 
taketh freedoms with its prop- 
erty. 

Thou shalt not explore the limits of 
thy prison. Trust in the Kenya 
Corporation to extract thee. 

Thou shalt not program. 

Thou shalt not worry about the loca- 
tion of thy body, for it has been 
located, help is on the way, the 
cavalry has arrived, and all is in 
hand. 

Thou shalt meet a tall, handsome 
stranger who will guide thee 
from thy current plight. 

Thou shalt stay tuned for further 
developments. 



95 




He looked up and was happy to 
see that the angel was still there. 

“I won’t, I promise. But where 
is my body, and why has it taken so 
long to find it? Can you ...” 
“Know thee that appearing like 
this is a great taxation upon me, 
Mr. Fingal. I am undergoing strains 
the nature of which 1 have not time 
to reveal to thee. Hold thy horses, 
wait it out, and thou shalt soon see 
the light at the end of the tunnel.” 
“Wait, don’t go.” She was al- 
ready starting to fade out. 

“I cannot tarry.” 

“But . Apollonia, this is 
charming, but why do you appear to 
me in these crazy ways? Why all 
the pomp and circumstance? What’s 
wrong with letters?” 

She looked around her at the 
clouds, the sunbeams, the tablets in 
his hand, and at her body, as if see- 
ing them for the first time. She 
threw her head back and laughed 
like a symphony orchestra. It was 
almost too beautiful for Fingal to 
bear. 

“Me?” she said, dropping the 
angelic bearing. “Me? 1 don’t pick 
’em, Fingal. 1 told you, it’s your 
head, and I’m Just passing 
through.” She arched her eyebrows 
at him. “And really, sir, I had no 
idea you felt this way about me. Is 
it puppy love?” And she was gone, 
except for the grin. 

The grin haunted him for days. 
He was disgusted with himself 
about it. He hated to see a metaphor 
overworked so. He decided his 



mind was just an inept analogizer. 

But everything had its purpose. 
The grin forced himself to look at 
his feelings. He was in love; 
hopelessly, ridiculously, just like a 
teenager. He got out all his old let- 
ters from her and read through them 
again, searching for the magic 
words that could have inflicted this 
on him. Because it was silly. He’d 
never met her except under highly 
figurative circumstances. The one 
time he saw her, most of what he 
saw was the product of his own 
mind. 

There were no clues in the let- 
ters. Most of them were as imper- 
sonal as a textbook, though they 
tended to be rather chatty. Friendly, 
yes; but intimate, poetic, insightful, 
revealing? No. He failed utterly to 
put them together in any way that 
should add up to love, or even a 
teenage crush. 

He attacked his studies with re- 
newed vigor, awaiting the next 
communication. Weeks dragged by 
with no word. He called the post 
office several times, placed personal 
advertisements in every periodical 
he could think of, took to scrawling 
messages on public buildings, seal- 
ed notes in bottles and flushed 
them down the disposal, rented 
billboards, bought television time. 
He screamed at the empty walls of 
his apartment, buttonholed stran- 
gers, tapped Morse Code on the 
water pipes, started rumors in skid 
row taprooms, had leaflets pub- 
lished and distributed all over the 



OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



97 




solar system. He tried every 
medium he could think of, and 
could not contact her. He was 
alone. 

He considered the possibility that 
he had died. In his present situa- 
tion, it might be hard to tell for 
sure. He abandoned it as untestable. 
That line was hazy enough already 
without his efforts to determine 
which side of the life/death 
dichotomy he inhabited. Besides, 
the more he thought about existing 
as nothing more than kinks in a set 
of macromolecules plugged into a 
data system, the more it frightened 
him. He’d survived this long by 
avoiding such thoughts. 

His nightmares moved in on 
him, set up housekeeping in his 
apartment. They were a severe dis- 
appointment, and confirmed his 
conclusion that his imagination was 
not as vivid as it might be. They 
were infantile boogeyman, the sort 
that might scare him when glimpsed 
hazily through the fog of a night- 
mare, but were almost laughable 
when exposed to the full light of 
consciousness. There was a large, 
talkative snake that was crudely put 
together, fashioned from the in- 
complete picture a child might have 
of a serpent. A toy company could 
have done a better job. There was a 
werewolf whose chief claim to 
dread was a tendency to shed all 
over Fingal’s rugs. There was a 
woman who consisted mostly of 
breasts and genitals, left over from 
his adolescence, he suspected. He 

98 



groaned in embarrassment every 
time he looked at her. If he had 
ever been that infantile he wouij 
rather have left the dirty traces of it 
buried forever. 

He kept booting them into the 
corridor but they drifted in at night 
like poor relations. They talked in- 
cessantly, and always about hint, 
The things they knew! They seemed 
to have a very low opinion of him. 
The snake often expressed the opin- 
ion that Fingal would never amount 
to anything because he had so 
docilely accepted the results of the 
aptitude tests he took as a child. 
TTiat hurt, but the best salve for the* 
wound was further study. 

Finally a letter came. He winced 
as soon as he got it open. The salu- 
tation was enough to tell him he 
wasn’t going to like it. 

Dear Mr. Fingal, 

I won’t apologize for the delay 
this time. It seems that most of 
my manifestation^ have included , 
an apology and I feel I deserved 
a rest this time. I can’t be always 
on call. I have a life of my own. 

I understand that you have be- 
haved in an exemplary manner 
since I last talked with you. You 
have ignored the inner workings 
of the computer just as 1 told you 
to do. I haven’t been completely 
frank with you, and I will ex- 
plain my reasons. 

The hook-up between you and 
the computer is, and always has 
been, two-way. Our greatest fear 

galaxv 





at this end had been that you 
would begin interfering with the 
workings of the computer, to the 
great discomfort of everyone. Or 
that you would go mad and run 
amuck, perhaps wrecking the en- 
tire data system. We installed 
you in the computer as a humane 
necessity,- because you would 
have died if we had not done so, 
though it would have cost you 
only two days of memories. But 
Kenya is in the business of selling 
memories, and holds them to be 
a sacred trust. It was a mix-up 
on the part of the Kenya Corpo- 
ration that got you here in the 
first place, so we decided we 
should do everything we could for 
you. 

But it was at great hazard to 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



our operations at this end. 

Once, about six months ago, 
you got tangled in the weather- 
control sector of the computer 
and set off a storm over Kiliman- 
jaro that is still not fully under 
control. Several animals were 
lost. 

I have had to fight the Board 
of Directors to keep you on-line, 
and several times the program 
was almost terminated. You 
know what that means. 

Now, I’ve leveled with you. I 
wanted to from the start, but the 
people who own things around 
here were worried that you might 
start fooling around out of a 
spirit of vindictiveness if you 
knew these facts, so they were 
kept from you. You could still 



99 




do a great deal of damage before 
we could shut you off. I’m lay- 
ing it on the line now, with Di- 
rectors chewing their nails over 
my shoulder. Please stay out of 
trouble. 

On to the other matter. 

I was afraid from the outset 
that what has happened might 
happen. For over a year I’ve 
been your only contact with the 
world outside. I’ve been the only 
other person in your universe. I 
would have to be an extremely 
cold, hateful, awful person — 
which I am not — for you not to 
feel affection for me under those 
circumstances. You are suffering 
from intense sensory-deprivation, 
and it’s well-known that some- 
one in that state becomes pliable, 
suggestible, and lonely. You’ve 
attached your feelings to me as 
the only thing around worth car- 
ing for. 

I’ve tried to avoid intimacy 
with you for that reason, to keep 
things firmly on a last-name 
basis. But I relented during one 
of your periods of despair. And 
you read into my letters some 
things that were not there. Re- 
member, even in the printed 
mediumNt is your mind that con- 
trols what you see. Your censor 
has let through what it wanted to 
see and maybe even added some 
things of its own. I’m at your 
mercy. For all I know, you may 
be reading this letter as a pas- 
sionate affirmation of love. I’ve 

100 



added every reinforcement i 
know of to make sure the mes- 
sage comes through on a priority 
channel and is not garbled. I’m 
sorry to hear that you love me. I 
do not, repeat not, love you in 
return. You’ll understand why, at 
least in part, when we get you 
out of there. 

It will never work, Mr. Fin- 
gal. Give it up. 

Apollonia Joachim 

* -k -k 

Fingal graduated first in his class. 
He had finished the required courses 
for his degree during the last long 
week after his letter from Apol- 
lonia. It was a bitter victory for 
him, marching up to the stage to 
accept the sheepskin, but he 
clutched it to him fiercely. At least 
he had made the most of his situa- 
tion, at least he had not meekly let 
the wheels of the machine chew 
him up like a good worker. 

He reached out to grasp the hand 
of the college president and saw it 
transformed. He looked up and saw 
the bearded, robed figure flow and 
writhe and become a tall, uniformed 
woman. With a surge of joy, he 
knew who it was. Then the joy be- 
came ashes in his mouth, which he 
hurriedly spit out. 

“I always knew you’d choke on 
a figure of speech,” she said, 
laughing tiredly. 

‘‘You’re here,” he said. He 
could not quite believe it. He stared 
dully at her, grasping her hand and 

galaxy 




the diploma with equal tenacity. 
jl,g was tall, as the prophecy had 
said, 30*1 handsome. Her hair was 
cropped short over a capable face, 
jnd the body beneath the uniform 
,^,as muscular. The uniform was 
open at the throat, and wrinkled. 
There were circles under her eyes, 
and the eyes were bloodshot. She 
swayed slightly on her feet. 

“I’m here, all right. Are you 
ready to go back?” She turned to 
the assembled students. “How 
about it, gang? Do you think he de- 
serves to go back?” 

The crowd went wild, cheering 
and tossing mortarboards into the 
air. Fingal turned dazedly to look at 
them, with a dawning realization. 
He looked down at the diploma. 

“1 don’t know,” he said. “I 
don’t know. Back to work at the 
data room?” 

She clapped him on the back. 

“No. I promise you that.” 

“But how could it be different? 
I’ve come to think of this piece of 
paper as something . real. Real! 
How could 1 have deluded myself 
like that? Why did I accept it?” 

“1 helped you along,” she said. 
“But it wasn’t all a game. You re- 
ally did learn all the things you 
learned. It won’t go away when you 
return. That thing in your hand is 
imaginary, for sure, but who do you 
think prints the real ones? You’re 
registered where it counts — in the 
computer — as having passed all the 
Courses. You’ll get a real diploma 
"'hen you return. 

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK 



Fingal wavered. There was a 
tempting vision in his head. He’d 
been here for over a year and had 
never really exploited the nature of 
the place. Maybe that business 
about dying in the memory bank 
was all a shuck, another lie in- 
vented to keep him in his place. In 
that case, he could remain here and 
satisfy his wildest desires, become 
king of the universe with no opposi- 
tion, wallow in pleasure no emperor 
ever imagined. Anything he wanted 
here he could have, anything at all. 

And he really felt he might pull it 
off. He’d noticed many things about 
this place, and now had the know- 
ledge of computer technology to 
back him up. He could squirm 
around and evade their attempts to 
erase him, even survive if they re- 
moved his cube by programming 
himself into other parts of the com- 
puter. He could do it. 

With a sudden insight he realized 
that he had no desires wild enough 
to keep him here in his navel. He 
had only one major desire right 
now, and she was slowly fading 
out. A lap-dissolve was replacing 
her with the old college president. 

“Coming?” she asked. 

“Yes.” It was as simple as that. 
The stage, president, students, and 
auditorium faded out and the com- 
puter room at Kenya faded in. Only 
Apollonia remained constant. He 
held onto her hand until everything 
stabilized. 

“Whew,” she said, and reached 
around behind her head. She pulled 

101 




out a wire from her occipital plug 
and collapsed into a chair. Someone 
pulled a similar wire from Fingal’s 
head, and he was finally free of the 
computer. 

Apollonia reached out for a 
steaming cup of coffee, on a table 
littered with empty cups. 

“You were a tough nut,” she 
said. “For a minute I thought you’d 
stay. It happened once. You’re not 
the first to have this happen to you, 
but you’re no more than the twen- 
tieth. It’s an unexplored area. 
Dangerous.” 

“Really?” he said. “You weren’t 
just saying that?” 

“No,” she laughed. “Now the 
truth can be told. It is dangerous. 
No one had ever survived more than 
three hours in that kind of cube, 
hooked into a computer. You went 
for six. You do have a strong 
world-picture.” 

She was watching him to see how 
he reacted to this. She was not sur- 
prised to see him accept it readily. 

“I should have known that,” he 
said. “I should have thought of it. 
It was only six hours out here, and 
more than a year for me. Computers 
think faster. Why didn’t I see 
that?” 

“I helped you not see it,” she 
admitted. “Like the push I gave 
you not to question why you were 
studying so hard. Those two orders 
worked a lot better than some of the 
orders 1 gave you.” 

She yawned again, and it seemed 
to go on forever. 

102 



“See, it was pretty hard for 
to interface with you for six hours 
straight. No one’s ever done it be- 
fore, it can get to be quite a strain 
So we’ve both got something to be 
proud of.” 

She smiled at him but it faded 
when he did not return it. 

“Don’t look so hurt. Fin- 
gal . what is your first name? I 
knew it, but erased it early in the 
game.” 

“Does it matter?” 

“I don’t know. Surely you must 
see why I haven’t fallen in love 
with you, though you may be a per- 
fectly lovable person. I haven’t had 
time. It’s been a very long six 
hours, but it was still only six 
hours. What can I do?” 

Fingal’s face was going through 
awkward changes as he absorbed 
that. Things were not so bleak after 
all. 

“You could go to dinner with 
me.” 

“I’m already emotionally in- 
volved with someone else, I should 
warn you of that.” 

“You could still go to dinner. 
You haven’t been exposed to my 
new determination. I’m going to re- 
ally make a case.” 

She laughed warmly and got up- 
She took his hand. 

“You know, it’s possible that 
you might succeed. Just don’t put 
wings on me again, all right? You’ll 
never get anywhere like that. ’ ’ 

“I promise. I’m through with 
visions — for the rest of my life.” ^

you were digging. .sneaky,

photographer’s model on the West 
Side, you know he’s got to be a lit- 
tle weird. You can burn the god- 
damn tape, I only did it, cause, 
y’see, I like — no, I need to have 
that camera peeping away or I can’t 
manage. .it sounds like bullshit 
but it’s not. .no, I don’t get off on 
petty fashionable decadence, I get 
off on you. You’re the first person 
I’ve ever met who listens to and 
understands what I say. And every- 
thing about the way you make love 
says that you care. A lot. So if 
you’ll stop screaming and put your 
clothes back on the floor where they 
belong. I’ll tell you something I’ve 
never told anyone before — Christ, 
that sounds even more bullshit. 
That’s how you know it’s true. 

Like most people in 1964, I was 
a virgin. Me, my best friend Ricky 
Obadiah, the rifle team, every girl 



in Sheepshead Bay High School 
Peter Paul and Mary, the Pope, 
mother, we were all virgins. The 
gym teacher and James Bond 
weren’t. The people in those 
grainy black and white English films 
supposedly weren’t, but sex always 
left them depressed so I knew they 
must be lying about having Done 
• It. Like a friend of mine some- 
times did. 

Look, now we can smile and say 
that being a virgin isn’t a crime, but 
you know damn well that at the 
time it’s the worst felony imagina- 
ble. With a life sentence, at least. 
And neither masturbating nor 
pathological amounts of necking 
help. 

So that summer I got a job as a 
bus boy at a big hotel in the 
Catskills. 

The first month was dismal. My 
hottest physical thrills came when 
somebody’s granny would try to 
stick a five in my pants pocket 
while I was stumbling past her table 
at high velocity carrying fourteen 
scalding bowls of kreplach soup on 
a bent tray. .yeah, that actually 
happened. 

In fact, one morning after they’d 
had an animal act in the night club, the 
trainer showed up for breakfast at my 
station accompanied by a fully dress- 
ed female chimp on roller skates. Big 
deal — she was only four, smoked 
cigars, and had a tendency to bite. Nol 
my type. Neither was the waitress I 
worked with. She kept asking if ^ 
loved her. I kept saying yes. She kep>

jaying no. I won’t entertain you with 
jl,e details. 

But then. 

Then there was Barbara. From 
fjew Jersey. With blond streaks in 
l,er hair, a job as a hostess in the 
cocktail lounge, and, most impor- 
tantly, a pair of Jersey license plates 
wrapped around a baby blue Le 
Mans convertible. Oooh. 

It was well into August, but I’d 
never seriously considered asking 
her out, because she spent all of her 
time with rich customers, the tennis 
instructor, and other grownups. But 
I’d already come on to every non- 
granny in the place, so, in a fatalis- 
tic mood — I think it was a joint, 
two beers, and a Jack Daniels — I, 
um, sorta, gulped-and-asked-her- 
for - a - date - in - one- quick - barely- 
audible-breath. 

She said, “What?” 

1 shrugged and examined the car- 
peting. 

She said, “It’s too noisy to talk 
in here. Why don’t you meet me 
after work tomorrow night and we’ll 
go for a drive or something?” 

Look, that may not sound very 
titillating to you, but for the next 24 
hours her one little “or something” 
kept me in a fever of speculation 
bordering on insanity. Shit. If only 
'vhat happened had lived down to 
my drably pornographic fantasies. If 
only someone had had the decency 
to slash her tires before we could 
leave the hotel. .well, tonight I 
"'ouldn’t have needed my friend 
Sony watching us in order to, ah, 

OPENING NIGHT 



add the final touch to the excite- 
ment of your being here. 

So we’re in the Le Mans, it’s 
dark out like it only gets dark on 
hilly country roads, and why don’t 
we just park and talk cause she’s 
not that hungry and is tired of pizza 
anyway. She “discovers” a dirt 
track and pulls off the road. About 
a mile and a half. Me and Barbara 
and the Le Mans snuggled behind a 
little rise in one end of a pasture. 
This is definitely a full-color 
American movie. 

I take a deep breath, slide down 
in the seat, let my head flop casu- 
ally in her direction, and say. .no- 
thing. Lungs bone dry. Brain too. 
Barbara smiles sweetly, sympatheti- 
cally, and slides down in her seat, 
deeply concerned at the prospect of 
spending a warm night in the mid- 
dle of nowhere with a paralytic. 

Nose to nose, she says, “Till last 
night you hadn’t said a word to me 
all summer. 1 thought you didn’t 
like me.” 

I giggle. 

“I love listening to you talk, like 
when you were telling the bartender 
about Hamlet it was really really 
funny.” 

1 shrug and fling my hands out in 
a gesture of humility, belting her in 
the chest. 

She is too amazed by the pain to 
make a sound. 

“Barbara, are you okay, it was 
an accident. I’m sorry. .does it 
still hurt?” And I reach out to touch 
— strictly a comforting gesture, and 

105 




she shrieks “NO!” and jerks back 
into the steering wheel, inspiring 
the Le Mans to let out a nasty, con- 
descending Gemeral Motors honk. 

Barbara bounces off the horn, sits 
very still, slowly breathing herself 
into control. 

“I’m really truly sorry, Barbara. 
Not just about hitting you, I mean 
grabbing like that, it was just an in- 
stinct, you know? I mean I couldn’t 
help it, I was trying to help, I 
would never have hit you in the 
boo — breast in order to have an ex- 
cuse to grab it.” 

“I believe you,” she whispers. 
“Ever make it in a convertible?” 

“No, I’ve never made it — in a 
convertible.” 

She slips into the back seat while 
somehow leaving her dress in the 
front seat. “It’s got a lot of hooks 
and stuff that guys can never open 
without tearing something. No of- 
fense.” No offense. I touch her 
thigh. She grins and closes her 
eyes. I run a hand up her leg. I, rub 
against her and she licks around my 
ear. She trails her hand across the 
back of my leg. I slide her bra up 
over her breasts. She reaches behind 
me and. .and, and — 

The flying saucer lands. 

Yeah, a flying saucer. It looks 
like a sandwich made out of two 
World War I helmets except it’s 
black, with a dull sheen, and it 
makes no sound except for this tiny 
beep-beep-beeping as if it’s coyly 
answering the mating call of the Le 
Mans. To this day I’m convinced it 

106 



was that damn honk that attracted 
those invisible shit-heads. Well, i 
can’t say for sure that they’re invis- 
ible, just that I never saw one. 

What I did see was a thick, flexi- 
ble black tube extrude itself from the 
underside of the hull — why didn’t 
we run away? For one thing, 
we’.re still rapturously tangled up in 
each other, wedged into the back 
bench of Barbara’s pastel love- 
mobile. For another, the atten- 
tion of my nervous and muscular 
systems is focused entirely on 
pacifying my bladder, which is 
threatening to cut loose like a 
busted water balloon. They say you 
discover profound truths about your 
inner soul during catastrophes, mo- 
ments of mortal danger; I discov- 
ered that I’d risk death rather than 
break toilet training. Look, it 
doesn’t sound impressive, but in 
fact it’s a character trait shared only 
by Old Testament prophets, great 
generals, and me. 

Where were we — yeah, the 
creepy black tube. It gets about one 
foot in front of us and three feet 
over our heads, and stops. Now the 
end unpuckers and this flower, sort 
of a feathery red tulip, quivers out. 
Barbara suggests that I throw her 
dress over the tulip and keep it dis- 
tracted while she jumps into the 
front and starts the car. I respect- 
fully decline, and explain that any 
civilization advanced enough to 
build a flying machine of this 
sophistication couldn’t possibly be 
into the wanton slaughter of friendly 

galaxy 





teenage aliens. Hamlet, l\ assure 
her, would simply raise an open 
hand in the universal gesture of 
peace. You first, she declares in her 
smugly realistic way. I relinquish 
her behind and raise my hand about 
a half-inch over my shoulder. The 
tulip rotates slowly towards us. The 
petal-feathers flex. An exhilirating 
perfume washes gently over us. We 
hear a softly swelling, otherworldly 
melody, the sugary keenings of cas- 
trati computers. Barbara smiles 
winningly and raises her hand. The 
tulip lunges and bites it. She howls 
horribly and collapses. 

I cunningly attempt to save my- 
self by shoving my hand into my 
pocket, but the tulip’s reflexes are 
better than mine and what I feel as 

Opening night 



I’m going under, screaming, is 
someone pouring Drano down my 
spinal cord. Look, those space 
cowboys may have peachy-keen fly- 
ing saucers, but 1 can tell you their 
tranquilizer guns leave a great deal 
to be desired. You never see Marlin 
Perkins putting a Thompson’s 
gazelle through those kinds of 
changes. And that turned out to be 
the friendly part of their act. 

When 1 came to 1 was lying on 
the slightly squishy floor of a seam- 
less, egg-shaped, dark gray room, 
and a disembodied voice was read- 
ing me a contract. 

“ ‘Whereas the sentient of the 
first part is deemed sufficiently 
lobed and glanded under the 
Trans-Spectral Convention, sub- 



paragraph XI 1.7^, the sentient of 
the second part may tender a stan- 
dard Sub-Diplomatic particle trans- 
mission agreement, pursuant to the 
limitations of the Voluntary En- 
meshment Code for Non-Member 
Planets. He, she, it, or they may 
signify and bind by verbal, chemi- 
cal, or ra^iational submission of 
personal name, spectra, registration, 
or metaphor.’ You may now signify 
your comprehension of our offer 
and bind your acceptance by stating 
your name.” 

“Huh?” I shot back. 

“It’s the deal of a lifetime, kid. 
We’re not the kind of outfit that 
takes advantage of unsuspecting na- 
tives. But we do have our prob- 
lems. We can’t afford to spend too 
much time in a sector as barren as 
this, so you’ve got to give us an an- 
swer right away.” 

“Huh,” said 1, quoting that his- 
toric first comment from an earth- 
ling to a starling. 

“It’s only a basic release form. 
No entanglements, no extensions or 
options involved. A crew from the 
Guameri Cluster will probably track 
us here within three or four unit’s 
time, but those cheap freks will 
offer you less, not more. We’re the 
only organization that can carry out 
an operation on this scale and get 
every detail perfect, all the way 
down the ellipse.” 

“I want Barbara. What have you 
done with Barbara?” I was not 
showing any heroic concern for her 
welfare. My terror had subsided just 

108 



enough for me to realize that I’d 
prefer being terrified with company. 

“You mean the female. She’s 
giving us a hard time too. All we’re 
asking is that you participate in a 
simple examination in exchange for 
the standard — but generous — 
examination fee. All the best races 
have consented.” 

Examination. The word reverber- 
ated in my stomach with disgusting 
overtones of karmic revenge: my 
repayment for mutilating untold 
numbers of frogs in order to pass 
Biology. 

“I was only following orders,” 1 
blurted out. 

“Huh?” the disembodied voice 
replied. 

“I don’t wanna talk any more un- 
less you bring Barb — the female in 
here right now.” 

“Certainly. The only reason we 
sejjerated you was that our prelimi- 
nary survey showed that it’s a 
species- wide habit of yours to con- 
duct business matters secretly, in a 
dark room. Now that you’ve agreed 
to cooperate, do you mind if we 
turn up the — ” 

“Hey! I haven’t ag — ” An open- 
ing zipped down one curved wall in 
a perfect imitation of a run down a 
stocking, and Barbara stepped 
through. I started towards her, then 
froze. “You’re naked,” I pithily 
observed. 

“So are you,” she pithed right 
back at me. Indeed I was. I had 
been so busy being scared I hadn’t 
noticed what I wasn’t wearing. Bar-

bara rushed over and wrapped her- 
self around me, sobbing lightly. It 
was wonderful. The spasmodic 
sway of flesh across my flesh re- 
minded me I’d been that close when 
we’d been kidnapped by a flying 
saucer with a disembodied voice. 
This was worse than terrifying. It 
was grossly unfair. 

“This is grossly unfair,’’ I 
shouted. 

“This is what you requested,’’ 
the voice whined. “We’ve brought 
the two of you together. Now if 
you’d only help us get on with the 
vital work of promoting intergalac- 
tic communication and understand- 
ing. .’’ 

“Can we have our clothes 
back?” whimpered Barbara. 

“Never mind that now,” I force- 
fully declared. “Let’s get this over 
with. Will you release us unharmed 
if we cooperate?” 

“Harmed? You misjudge us 
completely. Stand to one side, 
please.” We did, and a section of 
floor squooshed up and shaped itself 
into an immense table. “Here’s 
how it works. We read you the 
applicable subsection of the T.S. 
Convention. You say your names 
out loud. Then you place yourselves 
on the examination table, we con- 
duct the examination, and it is 
transmitted, live, to trillions of 
viewplexes on tens of thousands of 
planets belonging to countless 
species, sub-species, and mutants. 
A noble and absolutely painless ges- 
ture on your part on behalf of univ- 



ersal co-consciousness. For which 
you’ll be handsomely rewarded.” 

“And, um, if we’d rather not?” I 
asked. 

“We’ll return you to your planet 
as soon as possible.” 

Barbara’s sobbing ended ab- 
ruptly. “What do you mean return? 
What do you mean as soon as pos- 
sible?” 

“We had to get a few light-units 
away from your star to enhance the 
clarity of the transmission. Techni- 
cal reasons.” 

“Well, how long will it take to 
get back?” 

“That’s hard to say,” said the 
voice with cosmic insincerity. You 
could imagine it scratching its head 
and trying to look dumb, supposing 
it had a head. “We’ve just received 
word that our primary drive has de- 
veloped a quirdle. Average quirdles 
can be cleared up in a matter of five 
to ten minutes, our time. Unfortu- 
nately, that’s a few centuries, your 
time. Make yourselves comfortable, 
and don’t hesitate to borrow from 
our large library of philosophical 
and scientific literature.” 

“You can’t do this!” I 
screeched. 

“You win, when do we start,” 
Barbara said with utter calm. 

“Right away, right away — what’s 
this? Good news. Our computers 
report that it was only a ghost quir- 
dle, a mere mathematical anomaly 
we can rectify with a quick push on 
the Erase button.” 

“No shit,” Barbara muttered. At

that instant I fell extravagantly in 
love with her; I had no idea that 
anybody could simultaneously be so 
naked and so rational. Now of 
course I know it’s a faculty women 
are bom with and men develop only 
by being repeatedly dropped on 
their heads. But at the time — wow. 
So you can imagine how impressed 
I was when the next thing she 
piped up with was; “How much 
do we get?’’ 

“One artifact apiece from the 
most advanced technosynthesizer 
known. If you can think of it, we 
can make it. Relax, hold up your 
end of the bargain, and when you’re 
done, name anything and it’s 
yours.’’ 

Barbara and I broke our clinch 
and stared at each other. It was kind 
of obvious that if we stalled any 
longer our friends’ primary drive 
would immediately throw another 
piston. I stammered out a resigned 
Yes. The voice recited its legal 
sludge and we recited our names. It 
told us to get up on the table. We 
did. It was the same consistency as 
the floor, but warmer. The room 
grew uncomfortably bright. 

“Studio lights, you’ll get used to 
them in no time,” the voice assured 
us. “Get ready. Ninety of your sec- 
onds till transmission.” 

“Uh, exactly what happens?” 

“We ask you one question and 
you answer. Just be careful to keep 
insides the edges of the table, as they 
define the limits of the particle field 
we’re projecting.” 

no 



“One question?” 

“There’s only one question worti) 
asking. Remember, we represent the 
most advanced life-forms in the 
universe. Sixty seconds.” 

“What’s — ” I started to say 
when Barbara grabbed my arm and 
hissed. “Don’t ask.” 

“I’m curious. What’s the ques 
tion?” 

“ ‘How does your race express 
love?’ ” 

“Hell, I can never think of what 
to say when I really like a girl. You 
should have asked — ” Barbara cut 
me off with a playful punch in the 
kidney. 

“Don’t be silly,” the voice 
scolded. “Thirty seconds. You 
don’t say a thing. You show us. 
You’re legally obligated, you 
know.” 

Barbara deftly slipped her hand 
over my eyes and her tongue in my 
ear. “Shh,” she moaned. “It’ll be 
even better this way.” 

“Ten seconds.” 

Through all the agonizing days 
and nights of my pubescence I 
swore I’d do anything to get laid, 
but. .transmitted live to trillions oj 
viewplexes on tens of thousands of 
planets belonging to countless 
species, sub-species, and mutants? 

Well, you’ve gotta start some- 
where. 

“You’re on! . .Greetings, sen- 
tients. We know you must be w<Mi-

debited for triple the usual deep 
space reception fee. You shall see

jpd feel the reason soon enough, 
ppr the first time we penetrate the 
jgniotest far-flung spiral of an un- 
explored barbarian galaxy, a caul- 
jfon of steaming primitive lust the 
likes of which has not been experi- 
enced for eons! These proud crea- 
tures, royal offspring of the United 
Statsians, the galaxy’s most orgas- 
niic tribe, will give their uniquely 
violent response to the Fundamental 
Query: ‘How does your race 
screw? 

If what happened to me in the Le 
Mans was paralysis, what occurred 
in the saucer can only be described 
as rigor mortis. Granite stiffness ev- 
erywhere but in the crucial organ. 

“Hang in there. This will help,’’ 
the voice whispered. Four of the 
black tubes popped out of the ceil- 
ing, tulips rampant, spraying a 
tangy gas. 

By the end of the first breath, we 
both came down with a case of the 
Uncontrollable Giddies, followed 
swiftly by the Flashing Feelies: I 
could feel all the way through Bar- 
bara, feel those zillions of things 
watching, and it was all bliss,

touchness, Barbara, millions of 
mutants, Barbara, millions of mut-

ask for. Then. .it happened.

ing barbarians, and 1 can’t wait. 
Don’t ever tell me you know what 
it means to be embarrassed. 

Barbara, however, was deter- 
mined to be back in the Catskills by 
morning, and she wasn’t going to 
let a minor detail like my teenage 
overeagerness stop her. In a brief 
but extraordinarily pleasant time I 
was fully operational, and the rest is 
broadcasting history. Somewhere. 

After the show one side of the 
table dissolved and we found our 
clothing inside — someone had even 
been considerate enough to retrieve 
Barbara’s dress from the car. As we 
covered our nakedness our little 
Garden of Eden sunk back into the 
floor. I was still suffering from a 
residual euphoria induced by the 
combination of extra-terrestial dope 
and my boundless love for Barbara, 
and would have been content to 
stand there for hours, holding hands 
and gazing retardedly into her eyes. 
She got fidgety and started pacing. 

“You kids certainly showed a lot 
of. .promise,” the voice suddenly 
boomed into the room. “A high- 
powered operation like ours just 
might be able to tap your potential 
and turn you into great artists. 
Wealthy artists. All you have to do 
is signify and bind a long-term — ” 

“Forget it!” Barbara snapped. 
“You promised to pay up and put 
us back.” 

“Yeah,” I added. I took the op- 
portunity to slip a protective arm 
around Barbara’s fragile shoulders. 

A silence. 

Ill 




Barbara resolutely folded her 
arms. “I’m waiting.’’ 

“Oh all right. It’s your future to 
waste as you see fit. The Code for- 
bids us to synthesize any implement 
of mass destruction or anything else 
which would cause a major socio- 
economic upheaval. Within those 
parameters you may have any ar- 
tifact you wish. You’re being very 
shortsighted, you know.’’ 

Barbara pulled away from me. 
“You first,’’ she insisted with a 
cagey twinkle in her eyes. Here it 
was: the first test of our new-found 
love. I was determined to rise to the 
occasion. 

“I want an 11 X 14 color photo- 
graph of the two of us, nude, and 
kissing — with our eyes shut.’’ 
“You’re crazy!’’ she yelled. 

“I wouldn’t let anyone else see 
it, I swear. Hey, can you guys 
make it so that anyone else but 
Barbara and I who touched it 
would — would. .disappear!’’ 

The voice chuckled. “No prob- 
lem. We impregnate the paper with 
a magnetic bond-destabilizer keyed 
to warm-blooded animals. The de- 
stabilizing agent will be coded so 
that your two spectra-pattems will 
neutralize it.’’ 

A slot opened in the floor and the 
picture popped out. It was very 
clear. I offered it to Barbara, who 
looked at it for a second, sighed, 
kissed me, and said, “You’re so 
bizarre.’’ 

“Why don’t you ask them to 
make you a copy?’ ’ 

112 



“Because I think I’d prefer a cer 
tificate for ten thousands shares of 
AT&T. How about it. Voice?’’ 

“What’s an AT&T?’’ The voice 
sounded genuinely perplexed. “Dg 
scribe it in detail, or tell us where 
we can find a computer net we can 
penetrate and squeeze a duplicate 
out of.’’ 

“Wall Street-, New York City— 
the Stock Exchange. Can you find 
that?’’ 

“Are you kidding? Our comput- 
ers even found you. As a matter of 
fact, they’ve already identified your 
artifact, and inform me that while it 
is allowable under the Code, it is 
not advisable. The multipathic logic 
cicuit insists that there will be no 
way for you to explain such an ac- 
quisition to your Securities and Ex- 
change Commission, your Internal 
Revenue Service, or your mother.” 

“I can’t help it if my mother has 
a filthy mind!’’ 

“Neither can we. You’d best 
choose again.’’ 

“Dammit. .if I pick anything 
really valuable my mother is going 
to find out and give me a hard 
time. .what should I do?” 

“The Code forbids us to make 
suggestions,” the voice said. 

“You could get a picture of us in 
a different position,” I offered. 

She started pacing again, punched 
the wall, bit her lip, and got down 
to basics. “Okay, I give in. No 
cash. Make me a pill that ensures 
I’ll never have crow’s feet, stretch 
marks, or varicose veins.”

“Easy as tt,” the voice re- 
sponded. “In fact, if you’ll get 
back on the examination table, we 
can treat you sonically. You won’t 
feel a thing.” 

“No chance,” Barbara sneered. 
“Any payment I take from you 
sharks I want to feel, see, and 
hear.” 

A slim pedestal grew out of the 
floor in front of her. On it was a 
bright green capsule. It was buzzing 
raucously. 

“The sound stops after you swal- 
low it,” came the smarmy voice. 

“Can I have a glass of water to 
wash it down?” 

“Sorry, your contract states spec- 
ifically that only one artifact may be 
given.” 

I hope it’s working. I haven’t 
seen her since that summer. One of 
those sadistic tulips nipped me on 
the ass, and by the time the pain 
subsided we were in the car, about 
dawn, chilly, soaked in dew. Bar- 
bara informed me that if word of 
this ever got out to anyone, like 
anyone, I was on her shit list for 
life. She’d have me put right in a 
loony bin, just for starters. I asked 
her if that meant she didn’t want to 
go out with me again. She patted 
my cheek and told me that I was 
very sweet, and very perceptive. 

So that’s how I got to be. .this 
Way. My sex life has been a matter 
of what they see is what I get. Oh, 
at first it was enough to leave the 
lights on. Then the shades had to be 
up. Then. .well, you can imagine

how hard it is to find a third party 
who’s wilhng to sit and watch, at 
whatever hour I happen to score, 
even if it is easier these days to find 
a second party who’s willing to be 
watched. Luckily, I met a cyberne- 
tics major at N.Y.U. who was de- 
termined to find out why I was 
avoiding her bedroom. I confessed 
about needing an audience, she 
laughed and said she knew where 
she could borrow a video deck. 
What followed was the best semes- 
ter of my life. But cybernetics 
majors inevitably graduate and find 
high-paying gigs in faraway places. 

The Sony was her parting gift, 
my means for leading a somewhat 
normal life. As long as the lens is 
pointed my way and the little red 
light is on. .aw, c’mon, what mo- 
tive could I possibly have for mak- 
ing up. .. .if I did tell a psychia- 
trist he’d have me sealed in a pad- 
ded cell or exiled to Los Angeles. 

. .what? . .hey, I wouldn’t call 
you names like that if you had an 
emotional disability. .wait a 
minute — don’t rush out, I have proof! 
Just hold on, it’s in this drawer 
somewhere, .now, if you’re such a 
puritan and I’m such a pervert, 
what’s this? I’ll tell you what it is. 
It’s a picture of me and Barbara — 
the picture. See, we’ve got our eyes 
closed and everything, and — don’t 
do that! For chrissakes stop grab- 
bing at it you’ll.

There is so goddam much pes-

that I’m about ready to believe it’s

(Jeez, that’s the best lead I’ve 
had since “remember nostalgia?’’) 

GALAXY 




Seriously (as opposed to 
“grimly”), as I write this column 
winter is coming on, up here in 
Nova Scotia’s Annapolis Valley; 
I’ve got to find a new home and 
move into it; there ain’t no firewood 
cut; and some of my best friends 
have been giving convincing im- 
itations of enemies. A good editor 
just got fired, an advertiser bailed 
out of Galaxy partly because I dared 
appraise one of their books honest- 
ly, all the money I need to make it 
through the winter is owed me but 
not present, and what do I get to 
read for review? Hundreds of 
thousands of words of pessimism, 
of grotesque people and unpleasant 
situations and the Hairy Doom 
Around The Comer. It’s- enough to 
make a man start writing New 
Wave or someting. 

F’rinstance: 

* ★ * 

Bob Silverberg’s The Stochastic 
Man reminds me in at least one 
sense of John Brunner’s Shockwave 
Rider. Both books began just 
brilliantly, had me convinced in the 
first third or half that I was reading 
a genuine masterpiece, and then 
kinda petered out. Like being left 
on the verge after some inspired 
foreplay, it hurts. It frustrates. It 
makes you irritable. You gossip 
maliciously to your girlfriends. Well 
let me tell you what that so-called 
stud Silverberg did to me, dar- 
ling . 

BOOKSHELF 



Stochasm (if that’s the word) is 
the old if-you-had-enough-data- 
and-insight-you-could-predict-lhe- 
future wheeze. Isaac Asimov’s 
‘‘psychohistory” is an excellent 
example of the stochastic method, 
and his Hari Seldon is a stochastic 
man. Bester’s John Strapp is 
another. Silverberg’s Stochastic 
Man, Lew Nichols, is (Like Strapp) 
a chap who does this, more or less 
intuitively, for a living. He’s a 
trendpredicter in the world of 
1990’s America, a man who eats 
Gallup polls and spits predictions, a 
man who guesses right. He’s 
working for a policitian named 
Quinn, who might be the next 
President and might be the next 
Hitler. So far, great, with some 
superb writing. 

In the course of his work for 
Quinn, Nichols meets Carvajal, a 
burnt-out old man who is an 
honest- to-god prophet — he literally 
sees the future, all the time. (The 
explanations of this are much too 
overdone and repetitious for anyone 
who’s ever read any sf before, but 
let it pass). Carvajal has been 
shattered by the repeated vision of 
his own inevitable death, and no 
longer attempts to change the future 
he sees. He is utterly detached from 
Life, an actor endlessly repeating a 
script without a moral and which he 
did not write. 

So Nichols, fascinated by this 
horrid gift, becomes a disciple of 
Carvajal, giving over his whole life 
to learning how to develop the same 

115 




power. At Carvajal’s direction he 
performs random and pointless 
actions, blowing in the process both 
his exceptionally fine marriage and 
his job with Quinn, because Car- 
vajal’s vision of the future says he 
must, and there’s no point in 
struggling. If you resist the Flow, 
you can’t perceive the Flow, right? 
The second half of Stochastic Man 
amounts to a sales pitch for pre- 
destination, and frankly the in- 
ducements don’t sell me. Nichols’s 
submission to hopeless determinism 
(against which he never once 
struggles, even experimentally) 
costs him everything that ever 
meant anything to him; Carvajal’s 
brings him only the pointless life 
and absurd death he foresaw; and in 
the end, Nichols tells us that he is 
training and founding an academy 
of prophets like himself, who will, 
by virtue of being able to perceive a 
meaningless and inevitable future, 
“become like gods’’ somehow. 
Astonishingly, Nichols takes com- 
fort in the belief that predestination 
is what Albert Einstein meant when 
he said that “God does not throw 
dice.’’ That, he says, is why Jesus 
didn’t whimper on the way to the 
Place of Skulls. 

Phooey. I reject predestination so 
thoroughly and instinctively (as 
does Quinn, by the way) that I can’t 
like Nichols or this book. I don’t 
believe, (say,) that it is inevitable 
that New York will deteriorate to 
the point of universal city-wide 
rioting by New Year 2000. Possi- 
116 



bly. Maybe even likely. But not 
inevitably. People can get smarter. 
Hell, we can up and throw out a 
President because he outrages our 
moral sense. We can even smarten 
up and save ourselves — if we put 
our minds to it. And you can shove 
B.F. Skinner up your behaviorally- 
conditioned. 

Gettin’ a bit grumpy lately, 
aintcha, Bob? 

* ★ * 

Which connects, in a way, with 
why I don’t like to read Felix C. 
Gotschalk, even though he’s a 
fiendishly creative writer. I didn’t 
like him when I first ran across him 
in a Dave Gerrold anthology whose 
name escapes me, I didn’t like him 
in New Dimensions 5, I didn’t like 
him in Orbit 17 (of which more 
anon), and I don’t like Growing Up 
In Tier 3000 at all, in spite of the 
fact that there may be a pun in the 
title (that’s okay, though — 

Gotschalk himself says in the flyleaf 
of the book that “If people ‘like’ 
what I write, fine — if they don’t, 
it’s no skin off my ass.’’). 

Look, if you need me to tell you 
that the psychiatrist’s and 

psychologist’s view of mankind 
is bullshit, you’re in serious trouble. 
If you haven’t noticed by now how 
many of your friends have been “in 
therapy’’ for up to twenty years 
without getting any smarter, I can’t 
help you. A priest who doesn’t 
believe in the existence of the soul 

GALAXY 




is a fool, and all the jargon in the 
world about Oedipal transfers and 
motive-tropisms and self-worth- 
vectors and homeostatic endocrine 
balance don’t explain Mahler’s 
Symphony of a Thousand. 

Well, the hell of this thing I have 
with Gotschalk is that I think he 
agrees with me. I think that his 
extrapolations of modem pyschiatric 
jargon and what Silverberg calls 
“technology-speak” into a future 
world wherein a lover “wove a 
complex pattern of friction vectors 
into the coitional matrix” and 
children take fifty milligrams of 
amphetamine with every breakfast 
are meant to be nightmare glimpses 
of the ghastly Brave New World we 
could forge ourselves if we ever 
decide to commit ourselves to 
cultural belief in that crap. And in 
spite of that, I can’t stand reading 
Gotschalk. 

I don’t like wading in and dining 
on crap, even to make the point that 
it’s undesirable, and I find virtually 
everything Gotschalk writes too 
flat-out unpleasant to read. Now dig 
it: he writes brilliantly, just 

shotgun-spatters of pure creativity, 
superb erudition (he is, after all, a 
professional psychologist himself) 
and dazzling style — but his visions 
of a world in which literally every 
human value has been thrown out in 
the pursuit of “self-worth rein- 
forcement” and sensory satisfaction 
are so chilling, so disgusting, so 
horrific, that they make my skin 
crawl. 

BOOKSHELF 



Tier 3000 is the far-future re- 
finement of that kind of cultural 
ethos — a world in which children 
customarily and inevitably murder 
their p^ents (with societal approval) 
at about puberty (that is, age 5); in 
which a telepathic fetus, jaded be- 
fore birth, reports sourly on the 
taste of amniotic fluid and the 
boredom of intrauterine life in 
which humans (and I use the term 
advisedly) have been so superman- 
ized by life-support, teleportation 
and telepathy implants as to become 
like angels, yet remind one of 
nothing so much as the demonic 
children of Lord of the Flies. 

It’s a warning — but one too 
obnoxious for me to heed, and one 
that I believe is unnecessary. 1 re- 
fuse to believe that the race as a 
whole could be that stupid, that 
grotesque, that inhuman. The only 
ones who need such a warning are 
those who really believe that mod- 
ern psychiatry has discovered the 
Meaning of Life — and they’ll be too 
stupid to understand the warning. 

You might like Gotschalk — but if 
so, you oughta talk to your shrink 
about that masochism of yours. 

★ ★ ★ 

Likewise Gary K. Wolf’s Kil- 
ler bowl. 

Not that Wolf has even as much 
claim on your sf dollar as Gotschalk 
does. Wolfs writing is literate, in 
the sense that he can construct a 

117 




sentence and place such sentences 
in coherent rows to tell a com- 
prehensible story (which almost 
qualifies him as a godsend 
alongside some of the stuff I have 
to read in this racket). 

But Killerbowl is a cheap rip-off 
of Rollerball Murder, another one 
of those books that deplores our 
senseless lust for violence by filling 
162 pages with as much violence 
and bloodshed as they’ll hold. Like 
Rollerball, Killerbowl (cripes, they 
even sound alike) has a “hero” 
who is top man in a sport that 
amounts to legalized murder, whose 
life is jeopardized by the hunger of 
his corporate bosses for more 
thrills, more blood, more violence. 
Rather than roller-derby with 
motorcycles, the “sport” here is 
“street football” with rifles, knives 
and clubs. 

But Wolf’s book is even more 
unlikely than the grim story and 
movie it copies, positing as it does 
that the murderous sport will be so 
universally and phenomenally 
popular that the producers can af- 
ford to evacuate a ten-by-two-city- 
block area in the heart of major 
cities all over the world to stage 
each game, and that virtually 
everyone in the world will go in 
hock up to their armpits to pay for 
endless instant replays of individual 
murders. In the end, the hero 
(named Mann — get it?) revolts 
against the system — not because his 
bosses have been playing God with 
his life for a profit, but because 

118 



they haven’t been as fair as God. 
Mann learns that selected players 
have radio-receivers secretly im- 
planted in their skulls, and receive 
inside information from stra- 
tegically-placed stooges in the 
pay of the producers. He exposes 
this heinous practice publicly, live- 
on-camera, in the Superbowl 
Game — and all the viewers in 
America write in to complain that 
Mann spoiled the game by “saying 
all those dopey things” instead of 
getting on with the murdering. 

There are no Watergates in 
Wolf’s universe, nor any moral or 
ethical people. There are no people. 
There is no hope. Just lots of blood. 

Again, phooey. 

★ * * 

Now for some optimism about 
pessimism (weirdest book-reviewer 
in the West, folks — wind him up 
and he produces a paradox). 

I generally don’t care for Orbit 
collections. Partly the pessimism 
gripe, and partly the opinion that 
too many Orbit stories get so 
“lit’ry” that they ignore bourgeois 
conventions like plot and story and 
characterization — so-called “New 
Wave” stuff. So I stopped buying 
and/or reading Orbits at about Orbit 
7 or 5, a hiatus that lasted until I 
reviewed Orbit 16 in these pages 
(well, pages much like these) a few 
months ago. You know, to this day 
I’m not sure how much of that re- 
view had to do with the book itself, 

GALAXY 




and how much was a product of my 
feelings about the series in general, 
j can’t even check back and see, 
because I gave my review copy 
away (my custom with books 
neither good enough to keep nor 
reprehensible enough to burn in my 
stove). 

So I decided to give Orbit 17 an 
especially careful reading, with a 
firm leash on my prejudice. I’m 
glad I made the effort. 

Not that it’s a Hugo-winner. By 
my usual method of anthology- 
evaluation, it rates only 54% — I 
only liked 7 of 13 stories. But of 
those 7, one and possibly two are 
Hugo-quality, two others are ex- 
cellent, and the rest are quite good. 
Even the ones I didn’t like or 
understand seemed honestly 
written — they might be right up 
your alley. 

First off, let me nominate Jeff 
Duntemann’s “The Steel Sonnets’’ 
for consideration for the Short Story 
Hugo. It is a fine story, concerning 
two explorer-robots, one of whom 
has been given, at enormous ex- 
pense, the mechanical equivalent of 
a soul. He writes sonnets. The story 
is told from the viewpoint of his 
bodyguard, the robot that does not 
have a soul — or does he? Reminded 
me vaguely of Of Mice And Men 
(Of Mice And Metal Men?) The story 
"'as marvelously wrought, and I 
""ould like to see more of Mr. Dun- 
temann. 

Also excellent were “Toto, I

Kansas Anymore,” by Jeff Millar 
(the other Hugo possibility), an 
utterly hilarious re-working of the 
“It’s A Good Life” theme; “The 
Fun Palace,” by Raylyn Moore, 
also hilarious (a funny story about 
bestiality? Sounds like P.J. Farmer); 
and “The Anthropologist,’’ by 
Kathleen M. Sidney, a heartbreak- 
ing story which, now that I think 
about it, has the same premise as 
Stranger In A Strange Land — only 
turned around 180 degrees. John 
Barfoot’s “House” was a gentle, 
placid horror story of terrific im- 
pact, and Seth McEvoy’s “Which 
In The Wood Decays” was all that 
plus an actual plot. Lafferty’s 
“Great Day In The Morning” was 
typical Lafferty, reminding me as 
dways of an old Irish barfly with a 
headful of acid. You know you 
shouldn’t like Lafferty, but you do 
anyway. 

The rest I didn’t care for at all 
(though they showed talent), either 
because of the absence of plot, 
story, characters, and ending, or all 
of the above; or because they tried 
so assiduously to be grim or 
macabre that they ended up being 
literally unpleasant to read. For a 
change, Gotschalk’s “The Man 
With The Golden Reticulates” did 
not fall into the latter category, but 
the story was largely incoherent and 
barely comprehensible. Oh yes, I 
did like most of Damon’s editorial 
anecdote-fillers this time around, 
excepting the “Memory Machine” 
section. 

120 



So there you are. The good 
outweighs the bad in this collection 
and if nothing else buy it for “Steel 
Sonnets” and “Toto ...” 

* * * 

So much for pessimism. Onward 
to a tasty anthology. 

The Science Fiction Roll of 
Honor, edited by Fred Pohl, con- 
tains either stories or essays or (in 
Doc Smith’s case) a novel excerpt 
from men who have been Guest of 
Honor at a Worldcon (a world sf 
convention, for you ignoramuses 
out there — the next one is in Kansas 
City and the Guest is Robert 
Heinlein), perhaps the highest honor 
in sf. Not every GoH is included, 
but some of the best are, and as a 
group all are adequately rep- 
resented. 

There’s not much to say about 
this one — a clear 100% on the 
Spider Scale, and the only possible 
reason you could have for failing to 
purchase it (other than poverty, of 
course) is that you might have at 
least half to three-quarters of these 
stories already. It’s got PouTs 
“Kings Who Die,” Campbell’s 
immortal “Who Goes There?”. 
Lester’s classic “The Monster,” 
(remember George Expeto? God, 
what a rush) Heinlein’s “The Long 
Watch,” Sturgeon’s “The Hurkle is 
a Happy Beast,” and Isaac’s “The 
Last Question,” which Isaac, in his 
introduction to Jim Gunn’s Alter- 

GALAXY 




note Worlds (more of that anon, 
too) calls with characteristic mod- 
esty “the best science fiction short 
story ever published.” Also rep- 
resented are the late Jim Blish (God 
rest his soul and God damn the 
nicotine habit), Robert Bloch, Ar- 
thur Clarke, Lloyd Eshbach, Hugo 
Gernsback (dignum et justum est), 
Fritz Leiber, Willy Ley, Frank R. 
Paul, Doc Smith, and A. E. Van 
Vogt and the late E. Mayne Hull 
(God rest her soul too). Fred’s 
Introduction and introductions aire as 
always delightful and evocative. 

Altogether a Best Buy. 

* ♦ * 

Next a pair of books, similar in 
concept, widely different in 
execution: James Gunn’s Alternate 
Worlds — The Illustrated History of 
Science Fiction and Franz Rot- 
tensteiner’s The Science Fiction 
Book — An Illustrated History. Both 
are what is known in the trade as 
coffee-table books (out-sized, lotsa 
pictures), and to my mind Gunn’s is 
an infinitely preferable purchase, 
despite the fact that it costs twice as 
much. (One of the rare pleasures of 
reviewing is receiving the occa- 
sional really great book such as this 
one you’d never have been able to 
afford yourself.) 

James Gunn should need no 
introduction, but he’s going to get 
one anyhow. Past president of the 
Science Fiction Writers of America 



(pronounced “sif-wa”), teacher (of 
sf, among other things) at U. of 
Kansas, lecturer, author of plays, 
screenplays, articles, verse and 
criticism, he is best known for his sf 
short stories, novels like The Joy 
Makers, The Immortal (basis for the 
T. V. show). The Listeners and 
collaborations with the likes of Jack 
Williamson. Gunn’s illustrated 
history of sf is a real treat, cram- 
med with spectacular pictures 
sandwiched by knowledgable and 
entertaining prose. 1 learned much 
about sf and its legendary writers and 
fans, was delighted by the hundreds of 
photos (many by the Master, Jay K. 
Klein) of virtually everyone in sf his- 
tory, from Hugo Gernsback through 
Heinlein and Kornbluth to Joe 
Haldeman (so that’s what Pangborn 
looks like!) and enjoyed the spectacu- 
lar array of sf art through the ages. 
Lots of solid information, lots histori- 
cal interest, lots juicy photos, all 
cohesively arranged in a chronologi- 
cal progression — plus a record of 
Isaac’s hairstyles over a period of 
twenty years. 

Franz Rottensteiner does need an 
introduction, but all I have is the 
jacket blurb that says he’s “editor 
of the respected Austrian fanzine. 
Quarter Merkur." His illustrated 
history is much slimmer; contains a 
scattergun “collage” (An art di- 
rectors’ term meaning “disorderly 
heap”) of half-excellent, half- 
worthless art; is not even vaguely 
ordered, chronologically or any- 
logically; and contains infinitely less 

121 



BOOKSHELF 




written information, a good deal of 
which is wrong. There are no 
personal photos of writers, Stanis- 
law Lem is called “the greatest 
contemporary sf writer,” (more of 
him anon, too) and Rottensteiner 
bends so far over backward to be 
“international” (a nominally 
laudable ambition) that he gives 
more space to German writer 
Herbert W. Franke than he does to 
Robert Heinlein. He has the ig- 
norance to claim that “Theodore 
Sturgeon has merely adapted soap 
opera to science fiction, presenting 
schmaltz and tears rather than 
genuine feeling,” dismissing Ted’s 
.enormous worldwide popularity and 
influence as “a sure indication of 
the emotional and sexual immaturity 
of the whole sf genre.” (!) There’s 
one page on fandom, with a 7-word 
glossary of fanspeak; altogether too 
many stills from bad sf movies; and 
the dumb {Censored. -Ed.] omitted 
to mention (in his Awards appen- 
dix) the winners of the John W. 
Campbell Award for Best New 
Writer, which Gunn, bless him, did 
not (my own umbrage here may 
possibly have something to do with 
the fact that the co-winners for 1974 
were Lisa Tuttle and myself, your 
humble book-reviewer). Oh yes — 
there’s no Index. 

Rottensteiner’ s book is for those 
who know nothing of sf, and want 
to think they do (without troubling 
to read all them stories and novels). 
You’re welcome to my copy. 
Gunn’s book could serve such 

122 



people too, much more accurately, 
but it’s also highly recommended 
for those who do know sf, and 
want to know more. I know it’s too 
damned expensive. So go bug your 
local library — you can’t have my 
copy. 

A costiy Best Buy. 

* * * 

I picked up North By 2000, by 
M.A. Hargreaves, with anticipation 
and hope, because it said it was “a 
collection of Canadian science 
fiction.” Even finding out that it’s a 
one-man collection, and that the one 
man is a Canadian-by-courtesy from 
New York, didn’t deter me. After 
all, I'm a refugee from New York 
and America too, and it happens my 
agent is looking for a home for a 
collection of my own short stories 
(The Callahan’s Place Series, and if 
you’d like to see it, send me 
letters — it’s hard to sell a single- 
author collection and ‘I can use the 
ammunition). So I read the book, 
and found it dandy. 

Of the 6 stories in North by 
2000, one was printed in the Dec. 
J963 New Worlds and later an- 
thologized, and four appeared in 
New Writings In SF, avatars 11, 17, 
20 and 21. I wish to hell Har- 
greaves would submit stuff to 
American markets — we’d all hpve 
heard of him long ago. All these 
stories were at least good, and some 
(notably “Tangled Web” and 
“More Things On Heaven And 

GALAXY 




Earth”) were just terrific, genuine 
tours de force. Hargreaves reminds 
([le a little of Poul Anderson, and a 
little of Silverbob, writing 
thoughtfully and literately about the 
problems of extremely real human 
characters — a knack in short supply 
these days. I should also mention 
that the book’s design and interior 
art by Tim Wynne-Jones are 
striking, displaying much more 
thought and effort than most 
Americans put into their books. 

Let us be realistic. The chances 
of your finding a book of Canadian 
sf by a writer unknown in America 
from a publisher called Peter Martin 
Associates in your local bookstore 
are negligible. The chance that the 
bookstore will be able to success- 
fully order it is also vanishingly 
small. Therefore, 1 pass on the fly- 
leaf information that North by 2000 
can be ordered from Peter Martin 
Associates Ltd., 35 Britain Street, 
Toronto, Canada MSA 1R7; from 
Books Canada, 1 Bedford Rd., 
London N2, England; or from 
Books Canada, 33 East Tupper St., 
Buffalo, N.Y. 14203 if you happen 
to be an American (there is no truth 
to the rumor that I’m praising this 
book to lay the groundwork for a 
Canada Council Arts Grant once I 
get my Landed Immigrant status 
finalized). I’m sorry I can’t tell you 
the price, as my review copy inexpli- 
cably had the price clipped off the 
comer of the dust-jacket — ^but I can 
tell you it’s worth the effort to find 
out.

C’mon, Prof. Hargreaves — send 
something to Galaxy. 

* * * 

I’ve been hearing about Stanislaw 
Lem for some time, and although 
every furrin’-sf translation I’ve ever 
read has bored the pants off me, I 
decided high praise from Ursula K. 
LeGuin could not be gainsaid. So I 
tried The Invincible — and found it 
entirely vincible. 

I can’t honestly review the book 
as a whole, or Lem — I didn’t finish 
Invincible. But I can review the 
translation, which kept me from 
finishing it despite my standard 
three-fair-tries: it bored the pants off 
me. It’s a translation of a transla- 
tion, actually — the Polish original 
was translated into German, then 
re-translated for Ace’s “Special” 
line by Wendayne Ackerman, who 
is responsible for most of those 
Perry Rhodan infections. I don’t 
know about the Polish-German 
translator, who receives no credit in 
the Ace version, but Ms. Ackerman 
obviously translated literally, word 
by word, with the aid of a twenty- 
year-old German-English dictionary. 
The prose stumbles and then falls 
flat on its face, never to rise again, 
and the characters act and react 
incomprehensibly. I simply lost 
interest. 

Some of it appears to be Lem’s 
fault, too. For instance, the starship 
Invincible is commanded by her 

123 




as troga tor Horpach, which seems 
odd. Further, Rohan, who does most 
of the actual bossing (as opposed to 
Horpach’s policy-making), is told 
on p. 20 that the atmosphere of the 
new planet Invincible has landed on 
is “nitrogen 78%, argon 2%, car- 
bon dioxide zero, methane 4%, the 
rest is oxygen,’’ and, making a 
lightning mental calculation (dis- 
playing brains), asks at once, 
“Oxygen sixteen percent? Are you 
sure?’’ — Rohan is struck only by 
the presence of so much oxygen on 
a lifeless world. And yet four pages 
later, when the identical information 
is given him by Horpach, he 
realizes at once that 4% methane 
and 16% oxygen is “an explosive 
mixture’’ that should have blown up 
the whole planet when Invincible'^ 
jets first struck atmosphere (oh 
yeah?), and he does not appear to 
notice that he missed something the 
last time around. 

It may be that the book as a 
whole contains some startling and 
revolutionary ideas, and sf is often 
said to be the literature of ideas, so 
maybe Lem is as good as he’s 
cracked up to be. But the lifeless 
translation kept me from finishing 
more than a third of this book, and 
the ideas in that third were un- 
original, stereotyped and dull. 
Besides, as a certain editor once 
told me, “Ideas are a dime a dozen. 
It’s good writing I buy.’’ 

Me too. Invincible is titanic — in 
the same sense that the Titanic was 
invincible.

Okay — my welcome is thread- 
bare. Four minireviews and you can 
go- 

The Spacejacks by Robert Wells 
also read like a second-hand 
translation from the Polish (only it 
ain’t) and I didn’t finish it either. 
Again, there may be some decent 
ideas here, but I just couldn’t fol- 
low it. 

Heinlein’s Space Cadet is a 
bonafide Heinlein juvenile — ’nuff 
said. If you don’t have it, get it. 

Likewise Great Stories of Space 
Travel, one of Groff Conklin’s 
countless impeccable anthologies, 
and Voyagers In Time, one of 
Silverberg’s solidest. Both are 
umpteenth editions (original 
copyrights 1963 and 1967 respec- 
tively) of often-anthologized classics 
of sf. Only one or two stories were 
unfamiliar to me, but all were a 
pleasure to read or re-read. A 
couple are Hugo- winners, most are 
standard classics — if you don’t have 
’em, get ’em. Best buys for the 
neofan, with the slight edge to

YATT 



X1.ARRY WALDENSIEL WAS SITTING 
in his cheesy apartment, reading a 
Theodore Sturgeon novel, when 
God appeared before him in the 
middle of the living room. 

There was an uncomfortable 
pause as Harry squirmed in his ab- 
surdly comfortable arm-chair, won- 
dering what to say. (There was no 
need for introductions, of course. 
When God appears in your living- 
room, you know it. Devine Revela- 
tion.) 

“Uh . hi there,” Harry stam- 
mered at last. ‘‘I was just reading 
about you.” 

God smiled. Wouldn’t you? 

“Appropriate,” he said, in a 
voice that sounded . like a 
voice. 

There was another uncomfortable 
pause. God’s eyes seemed to glaze 
slightly, and Harry agonized as the 
seconds dragged by. He’s dead, 
came the wild thought, followed 
closely by mortal terror. 

“Hello?” he ventured. 

God shook His head slightly. 
“Sorry,” He said sheepishly. 
“Pretty thing happening out in the 
Horse Nebula. Got hung up.” 

Harry nodded absently. 

God harrumphed. “Now then, 
Harold Waldensill ...” 

“No sir, it’s just Harry,” Harry 
said automatically, and then wished 
he could bite off his tongue. 

“What’s that?” asked God, Who 
hates to be interrupted. 

“Sorry God, I didn’t mean to cut 
you off. It’s just that most guys 

126 



named Harry are really Harold, but 
I’m not. I mean that’s what my 
father put on the birth certificate: 
‘Harry.’ I mean, I ... he 
didn’t . .’’He trailed off. 

“Yes,” said God very gently. 
“Now then, Harry, I’ve got a very 
momentous announcement to make 
to you.” 

“You gonna come out for birth- 
control?” Harry burst out. “Hey 
man, you gonna make dope legalT’ 

Harry suddenly found himself 
hip-deep in shit. He subsided. So 
did the shit. 

“Pay attention, mungle-bungle. 
This is serious. This is cosmic. This 
is the single most important event in 
history. I am going to make you 
God.” 

Harry swallowed. 

Harry swallowed again. 

He blinked three times fast. 

He opened his mouth and closed 
it again, twice. 

“Why me?” he managed at last. 

“Because,” God said brightly, 
“I calculate that you are dumb 
enough to do it.” 

Harry considered that for a long 
time, while poor memories of inac- 
curate renderings of various nebulae 
ran across the top of his mind, and 
a snake-dance of naked ladies 
slithered along the underside. 

“Yes,” he said finally, “I think 
you’re right. I can’t wait to see the 
catch.” 

“No catch,” God insisted. 
“Square deal all the way. I propose 
to give you the works: omnipo- 

GALAXY 




tence, omniscience, the whole deal. 
Forever, or until you can find your- 
self another sucker. ’ ’ 

“And if I misuse it I go to Hell, 
right?” said Harry with the weary 
cynicism of the longtime science- 
fiction fan. 

“Don’t tempt me, Harry,” God 
said drily. “I don’t have to go 
through with this. Now listen, 
schnook, how can you go to Hell if 
you’re God? There doesn’t have to 
be a Hell if you don’t want one. I 
find it handy myself, but I’m told 
others did just fine without one.” 
“Others?” Harry interrupted 
nervously. “High turnover?” 

“Eternity’s a long time,” God 
replied. 

“Yeah, I suppose. But listen, 
you mean if I want, I can go on 
being God forever? No punishment 
if I do something bad?” 

“You define bad, dullard. If you 
want the whole universe to be a 
giant vagina and you a phallus, and 
that by you is good, that’s good.” 
He shuddered. “It’s been done.” 

“I mean ... I mean,” Harry 
stammered, “I mean I could 
straighten out all the things that are 
messed up in this world?” 

“If you want to bother with this 
one, you’re welcome to try. But 
yQu’ll have an infinity of time and 
worlds to tinker with. ’ ’ 

“Will I be able to understand 
that?” Harry asked seriously. 

“And work with it,” God nod- 
ded. 

“Holy shit,” said Harry. 

WANT AD 



“If by you that’s good,” God 
agreed sadly. 

“Wait,” said Harry, having lo- 
cated a last loophole. “What about 
you? Do we share, or what?” Infin- 
ity seemed suddenly cramped. 

“Oh, I’m retiring, didn’t I say? 
Matter of fact. I’m going to go be- 
come a redwood in California for 
awhile, and die when the redwoods 
do. You can fall by for advice, if 
you like, before you scrap this uni- 
verse and build another. Which you 
can do this afternoon if it suits you; 
it’s all the same to me. But I would 
recommend that you fiddle with this 
one first, to sort of get the feel of 
it.” 

“Oh, by all means,” Harry 
agreed abstractedly. He steepled his 
hands, then separated them. 
“Well,” he said firmly, “no sense 
stalling. Do it.” 

And God did it.

Harry Waldensill took the subway 
out to Queens to see His old lady, 
Janet. The subway was immacu- 
lately clean. The patrons were few, 
but universally pleasant and ami- 
able. They met Harry’s eyes with- 
out flinching, and the children were 
well-behaved. After a noiseless, 
painless journey, Harry was de- 
canted onto Woodside Avenue, 
where cheerful taxi-drivers ex- 
changed polite conversation with 
smiling pedestrians while waiting 
out a traffic jam that was even now 
straightening out. 



127 




“This,” thought Many. “I could 
learn to live with. This is gonna 
take a little getting used to. I can 
see that right now.” 

Six cabs cut smoothly through 
traffic in response to Harry’s raised 
hand. The driver of the fourth in 
line offered to haul Him for free, 
“seeing as how there’s already 
some people in the cab and it ain’t 
exactly the whole cab available for 
hire.” The passengers, two Negroes 
who were not going anywhere near 
Harry’s way, protested that He 
would be perhaps too cramped, and 
offered to find themselves other 
accomodations. But Harry waved 
away their embarassment and slid 
into the cab. 

As the hack eased gracefully into 
city traffic, Harry regarded His two 
companions with a growing confi- 
dence. “You know,” He said, 
“perhaps you can help me. There’s 
something I’ve wondered for a long 
time, and now that I’m in a position 
to do something about it . well, 
what I want to ask is, er . What 
exactly is it that you people want?” 

The two young black men looked 
away uneasily, and Harry sighed (as 
Gods had done before Him) and 
looked into their hearts, and what 
he saw there shook Him so badly 
that He hardly noticed reaching His 
destination and getting out. 

He snapped out of it when a pas- 
sing flower-child kissed Him on the 
lips, right in the middle of the 
sidewalk. Pondering on that one, 
Harry stumbled into the apartment 

128 



lobby and paused, bewildered, in 
front of the panel which contained 
two hundred and twenty-four door 
buzzers. He could somehow never 
manage to remember even in which 
quadrant Janet’s buzzer-button lay, 
and they were in no especial order, 
either by name or apartment 
number. Cursing, He hunted — then 
straightened up with a grin. 

“I sure am slow today,” He mut- 
tered, and teleported directly to 
Janet’s apartment. 

He hadn’t thought to knock. He 
found Himself in the living room, 
facing the open bathroom door. It 
framed a picture whose chief com- 
ponents were Janet and the toilet 
bowl. 

He closed His eyes. When he 
opened them again, he was facing 
the living room sofa, on which 
Janet was seated in a negligee. 
Slowly absorbing the implications 
of what His subconscious had just 
done, more or less as a reflex ac- 
tion, Harry trembled. 

“Harry,” Janet said delightedly, 
“I thought you had the night-beat 
tonight.” Harry was — had been — a 
reporter, which provided a wealth 
of excuses for broken dates, forgot- 
ten engagements, and . nights on 
which Harry wanted to read a 
Theodore Sturgeon novel. 

“Well, yeah, you see, honey, 
I . uh, something came up.” 

“Tell me about it. Want to get 
high?” She pulled a joint from 
under a pile of comic books and of- 
fered it to Him. 



GALAXY 




“Yeah, thanks,” He said ab- 
sently, lighting up and toking 
deeply. “Janet, listen, I mean some- 
thing really big has come up. I 
mean, it’s going to color our whole 
relationship.’’ He exhaled. 

“You lost your job.” 

“Not exactly, no. Not yet, any- 
way. I mean, I’ve got a new job. 1 
mean . I’m God.” 

“Gimme that joint.” 

“No, really, man. I’m God. I 
mean God told me so Himself.” 
“Harry, you tripping?” 

Suddenly they were on the top of 
Mount Everest. Howling winds 
thrashed about them, yet they were 
not cold, neither were they buf- 
feted. 

“Harry, am I tripping?” 

“No Janet. It’s true. I’m God. 
You want to go to Paris? Or, hey 
wow, how about into the past, 
maybe the future? I mean, anything 
you can name, I can do. I’m God. 
Dig it.” 

Janet stared at Him for a long 
long time, and then backed slowly 
away. And off a ledge into the 
abyss. 

Harry closed His eyes, and when 
He opened them again Janet was 
seated a short distance away on a 
maroon camel-saddle, confusion in 
her limpid brown eyes. Thank you, 
subconscious, He thought briefly. 

They both sat lost in their own 
respective thoughts, she on her 
camel-saddle, Harry on empty air. 
After a time, Janet hesitantly spoke. 
“Harry, I’ve thought it out. I 

Want ad 



don’t know how this ridiculous 
thing happened, but Harry I want 
you to know it doesn’t change my 
feelings about you. I’ll be happy to 
be your Goddess.” 

When Harry’s eyes opened again. 
He was alone on Everest. 

He decided to trust His subcon- 
scious again. 

The next while or so was pretty 
busy. The first thing that ocurred to 
Harry was to solve the Problem of 
the Poor. He caused the Congress to 
declare a guaranteed national in- 
come of $20,000 (with price con- 
trols built in) and created enough 
money to pay for it. But He was 
taken by surprise when He discov- 
ered how many people were 
thrown out of work by the disap- 
pearance of The Poor. Not that they 
went hungry — the GNI took care of 
that — but their training suited them 
for no other occupation, and they 
were miserably unhappy with noth- 
ing to do. Included in the list of 
unfortunates were poverty-agency 
caseworkers and staffs, dozens of 
Congressmen, numbers runners, 
dope peddlers, loan sharks, and the 
majority of the nation’s policemen. 
The disappearance of the dope 
peddlers alone would have collapsed 
the national economy, but the im- 
plications of financial security for 
all ran much deeper than that. Riots 
broke out. 

Harry fixed it so that there was 
pleasant, rewarding occupation for 
all. The He discovered that with 
nobody going hungry, creativity by 



129 




and large was disappearing from the 
land. The rest of the world mean- 
while lay in smoking chaos caused 
by the drastic upheaval in world 
economics, and it was getting har- 
der for Harry to put off repairing it. 

Finally He gave up in disgust, 
gave in to whim.

Alicia Denderby lay on her back 
on a sturdy, sensible bed moaning 
softly. 

For many of her contemporaries, 
this action would have been so 
commonplace as to be unworth re- 
cording, but Alicia was virgin both 
in mind and body — a difficult thing 
to find in any culture. Thoroughly 
corrupted by a psychotic upbring- 
ing, Alicia sincerely believed to the 
depths of her soul that sex, and 
most things having to do with 
touching or rubbing, were a hideous 
snare designed by the Devil to 
facilitate the theft of feminine virtue 
by slavering, lust-maddened males. 
She had never done such a thing be- 
fore, and the ensuing sensation was 
even more disturbing than it was 
novel. Alicia’s head whirled. 

She could not understand why 
she was doing this. A few moments 
ago she had been sitting up in bed, 
watching T.V. before dropping off 
to sleep. A pot-bellied man in a 
hard-hat had just explained a new 
wrinkle in the ancient protection 
racket whereby the victims were in- 
vited to purchase appliances and 

130 



furniture at considerable discounts. 
Alicia giggled: she thought the fat 
man was “cute.” 

“So dat’s da story, Jerry?” came 
an off-camera chorus. 

As Jerry threw out his arms to 
bellow his answer, his pot belly 
sprang a leak. Hissing wildly, he 
deflated, glancing about for advice. 

Alicia sat up a little straighter. 

Jerry lay sprawled across the 
floor like a dead inner-tube. A 
short, utterly nondescript nebbish 
appeared stage left, strolled over 
and stood on Jerry, insanely remind- 
ing Alicia of a White Hunter on a 
leopard skin. 

“D/j is de story,” said the neb- 
bish. “I am Harry Waldensill, and I 
am here to tell you that there has 
been a little reshuffling upstairs. 
Back when I was human I was al- 
ways convinced that there was no 
authority higher than my own 
reason, and I never did believe 
there was a sexier man alive than 
me. Amen amen I say to you, ‘So 
be it.’ ” 

Then the set had gone blank, and 
Alicia Denderby had slid lower on 
the bed, rucked up her nightgown, 
and begun to fantasize furiously, 
with Harry Waldensill’s face 
splashed across the inside of her 
eyelids. 

So, across a vast network area, 
had millions of other women. 

Writhing, moaning, Alicia fought 
desperately against the waves of lust 
that racked her body, cast about for 
a weapon with which to fight off 

GALAJff 




temptation, ward off the dev- 
il .. ward off the devil! Her eyes 
fell upon the crucifix that hung over 
the T.V., and with an enormous ef- 
fort she plucked her hand away and 
staggered to her feet. The jolt of her 
feet contacting the floor traveled up 
the smooth columns of her legs and 
set off explosions. Weaving consid- 
erably, she reached the far wall, 
snatched down the crucifix, and 
half-walked, half-fell back to the 
bed. 

She collapsed across it, clutching 
the crucifix in both fists. The tides 
of lust seemed to subside a bit, and 
she relaxed. 

The crucifix leaped from her 
hands, excuted a flawless Immel- 
man Roll and — disappeared, cross- 
bars retracting. 

Her body went taut; her eyes rol- 
led. “God help me,” she moaned. 

“Glad to oblige,” came Harry’s 
voice, distantly muffled.

Arthur Kellog was in a hell of a 
hurry. Consequently he wished for 
the ten thousandth time that there 
Was a faster way than Route 25A to 
get to Riverhead. While the two- 
lane highway carried a 55 mph 
speed-limit for most of its winding 
length (signs terminating occasional 
lower local limits caused the legal 
speed to revert to New York State 
maximum) absolutely no one' knew 
It but the cops. Farmers took 25A

to market in antique pickups; 
women in stationwagons backed up 
traffic for miles. 

Somehow it was more infuriating 
to Arthur to drive at an average of 
40 MPH down 25A than to drive an 
an average of 25 through downtown 
Port Jefferson. That you expected to 
be slow — this was supposed to be 
open road. Arthur had hoped he would 
meet no traffic. 

A vegetable stand came into view 
around a long curve, against a 
background of distant forest and 
immense power-utility towers. The 
highway was studded with such es- 
tablishments, offering runty carrots 
and malformed ears of com to the 
budget-conscious. Arthur happened 
to be doing a good 60 at the time.

having successfully passed a pair of 
mobile homes back around Wading 
River. He was in a desperate rush 
to reach the Suffolk County Center 
in Riverhead, where a land acquisi- 
tion deal was about to make him 
stinking rich — he hoped. 

As he neared the fruit-stand, a 
brand new Chrysler convertible con- 
taining three senior citizens and a 
fat lady pulled out onto the road be- 
fore him, doing a snappy 15. The 
oncoming lane held a procession of 
oil trucks that stretched as far as the 
eye could see, which at that particu- 
lar spot was a great long way. 

Arthur went cold, telling himself 
that if he slammed on the brakes 
right now, he might not be going 
too fast to pull off into the corn- 
field by the time he reached the 
Chrysler. He uttered a brief, heart- 
felt prayer 

A bolt of lightning from the 
cloudless sky struck the Chrysler 
squarely on the fat lady; it exploded 
in an incandescent ball of flame and 
was gone. 

The road was clear. Arthur’s foot 
had not had time to come down on 
the brake; in seconds he was flash- 
ing through space previously oc- 
cupied by suicide-prone mummies 
and a glandular case. 

Thank you, God,” mumbled Ar- 
thur, bemused. 

“You’re welcome,” said Harry.

Not everyone was grateful. Cer-

tainly not the homosexual who 
awoke one morning in June to dis- 
cover that his groin no longer bore 
genitals (he had not specifically 
asked for a vagina). Nor the priests, 
ministers, rabbis and deacons of the 
nation when their houses of worship 
were packed to the rafters overnight 
with lime jello. Nor the politicians 
on T.V. shows throughout the coun- 
try when their mouths filled to over- 
flowing with something that looked 
like peanut butter (The President’s 
New Clothes were something to 
see). 

Eventually Harry turned His at- 
tention to the rest of the world, and 
what with restoring Angola calming 
down Ireland and turning all the he- 
roin in the world into Vitamin B and 
making all the fat people thin He 
had Himself quite a time, and 
learned quite a lot. The fat people, 
though thin, continued to be fat 
people — you could tell one when 
you met him. A lot of people mes- 
sed themselves up snorting Vitamin 
B, a restored Angola gave the 
guCTillas of all sides too much cover 
to work from, and Ireland, calm, 
simply didn’t know what to do with 
itself. 

Harry finally betook Himself, in 
the form of a black Persian cat, to a 
certain redwood tree in California. 
Curled before him-who-had-been- 
God, Harry presented His problem- 
His disillusionment. His frustration. 
His disenchantment. 

The immense gnarled redwood 
grew a face. It was patriarchal.

bearded, and framed in lines of 
scorn. 

“Aw, fer Chrissake,” it said. 
“Listen,” Harry said defensively, 
“maybe by you that was 
good . .” 

“Shows how much you know. 
Didn’t I ever tell you the straight of 
that?” 

Harry shook His head. 

“Well, 1 was corresponding with 
a gent named John, a promising 
young feller lived east of here. 
Anyway, one day I dropped by to 
visit him, wearing a body to be po- 
lite, and the young fool blew my 
cover right in front of a crowd.” 
“What’d you do?” asked Harry. 
“Decided to play along, just for 
the hell of it, without precogging so 
1 could be surprised.” He scowled. 
“Next time I’ll precog. But then 
there isn’t going to be a next time.” 
“A deal’s a deal,” said Harry 
nervously. 

“Numbskull,” said the tree. “If 
you didn’t have a roof on your 
mouth you’d blow your hat off 
every time you sneezed.” 

“You know, something like that 
has been happening,” Harry inter- 
rupted seriously. “Only I think it’s 
my subconscious.” 

“No doubt, no doubt,” snapped 
the tree. “You certainly haven’t 
been using anything else.” 

“Now look,” said Harry, “it’s 
easy enough for you to talk — 
you’ve had a lot of experience in 
this racket. What about some of that 
tnfinite compassion?” 

Want ad 



“Tripe. The attribute was created 
by my exploiters so that I would not 
be too frightening to worship: it was 
one of my biggest selling points. I 
don’t suppose you’ve been troubled 
by this ‘compassion’ syndrome?” 

Harry stirred uncomfortably. 
Even God must now and then shuf- 
fle His feet. 

“You think you know every- 
thing,” He muttered. 

“Not any more, cretin, but you 
do.” 

“Eh?” 

“Just like a human, hung up on 
playing with the toys. You’re so 
fascinated by omnipotence, you 
never paid the least bit of attention 
to omniscience. Look inside your- 
self, dummy!” 

Harry did. 

While he was doing so, the 
ground on which he stood under- 
went four distinct changes of own- 
ership, saw both advent and depar- 
ture of a glacier, trembled to 
both earthquake and nuclear fire, 
and at one point was entirely 
obscured by a mountain which oc- 
cupied the same space for a good 
many decades. Somewhere in there 
Harry’s physical envelope — the Per- 
sian cat — was destroyed, but He 
was far too preoccupied to notice. 

When He had at last come down 
from that first celestial rush which 
marks the onset of divinity, Harry 
looked about for the redwood — then 
realized it was long dead, obliter- 
ated by time and by entropy. And 
He smiled a bitter smile. 



133 




“God is dead,” he said. “Long 
live God.” 

* * * 

Harry found that omnipotence 
had not grown rusty in its centuries 
of disuse. With an exhilarating 
surge he plunged from His home 
planet headfirst into the Universe, 
expanding His awareness to the ap- 
proximate diameter of a fair-sized 
planet and ducking in and out of 
black holes both with and against 
the current. With an infinite number 
of viewpoints from which to select. 
He was in turn a star, a tachyon, a 
solar system, an electron, a nebula, 
and for one wild eon a chromium 
shopping cart careening between 
galaxies at translight velocities. 

Harry disassembled the Cosmos 
and caused it to run backwards. He 
tinkered with individual solar sys- 
tems, sometimes with individual 
planets or entities, sometimes even 
with individual molecules. He toyed 
with the concept of sexuality, 
created races of androgynes, races 
with tripolar sex, races with quad- 
ripolar sex — at which point even He 
became confused. He experimented 
briefly with alternatives to sex, but 
found them by and large to be flat, 
tasteless. 

He brought Time back to Zero 
and reprogrammed Matter, but with 
subtle improvements over the last 
run. He implemented the new pro- 
gram with a hell of a bang, because 
He was feeling His oats, and sat 

134 



back to enjoy the workings of a 
clockwork Cosmos so intricate that 
He Himself'was constantly surprised 
by its behavior. It made the previ- 
ous universe look quite punk, actu- 
ally, and had much more interesting 
visuals. A lot of the gaudier optics 
were self-generated by the humans, 
of whom there were a mighty shit- 
load (Harry having correctly figured 
how to achieve an unpredictable 
Cosmos). 

But the best light-show sooner or 
later ceases to hold the eye. Eternity 
is a long time. 

For a challenge, Harry took to 
whipping up other Cosmoses (Cos- 
meece?), seeing how many He 
could juggle at once. He ex- 
perimented with differing numbers 
of humans after His first effort de- 
stroyed itself (His grief, of course, 
was Cosmic). He soon found that no 
matter how many humans you put 
into a Cosmos, they would either 
blow themselves up or they 
wouldn’t, and God Himself couldn’t 
tell which it would be until it hap- 
pened. Periodic floods and other 
natural disasters seemed like a 
promising control device at first, 
but Harry discovered that most 
people are incapable of learning 
anything from the most object les- 
son. Pain-association techniques 
more subtle than don’t-touch-the- 
fire were lost on them. 

People were always too damnei 
busy hollering up at God to listen to 
Him. 

Eventually He concluded (as had 

GALAXV 




Gods before Him) that one planetful 
of humans was quite enough, thank 
you. He shut down all of His Cos- 
meece save those in which humans 
were restricted (by technology less 
than by temperament) to one tradi- 
tional earth-type planet near the 
time-honored G-type star. 

He settled down to some serious 
Godding for a spell, spicing up His 
Cosmeece from time to time by in- 
troducing varying numbers and 
types of aliens as foils for the hu- 
mans (Harry had no real use for 
aliens in and of themselves — He 
just couldn’t identify with them 
somehow). 

And, after a few hundred billion 
years of cyclical history, pickin ’em 
up and knockin’ them down with a 
fascinated curiousity eventually, in- 
evitably 

Harry was bored to tears. 

With an embittered cynicism, the 
catabolic phase of God’s love/hate 
relationship with Man, Harry Wal- 
densill quit. Retiring to spend His 
declining years as a tavern-keeper 
under the name of Mike Callahan, 
He passed on the Divine Mantle to 
a woman named L’Ran Kraxon, 
Who enjoyed it for a few billion 
eons before she palmed it off on an 
Arcturian called Rtxc K’Ploo’on 
(L’Ran lacked Harry’s xenophobia), 
'''ho fobbed it off on a sort 
of, . well, a mountain range, who 
passed it on once again, well-used 
but relatively well used, to me, 
Jehovah Wingate, about a hundred 
trillion years back.

And frankly, ladies and gentle- 
men, it’s been a long Eternity. 

Quite honestly. I’m sick of the 
abuse and the aggravation, the 
agony and the ecstasy, the whole 
megillah. I haven’t had a mi- 
crosecond’s peace since I took this 
job, and I’ve been thinking it’s time 
I checked out Nirvana. I’m ready to 
retire. 

So that’s why I’ve placed this ad, 
at tremendous expense, here where 
it will be seen by most of the 
science-fiction buffs. 

Come on, all of you smart-asses, 
who think you could do a better job 
of running the Universe — anybody 
want the job? ★ 





Ma! this is alter-ego. I have 
Geis in a fixation he’s going to 
have a tough time getting out of. 
(Hang the prepositions; let’m 
dangle!) 

I’m down here in the dungeon, 
true, and he is out in the dark, dank 
passageway trying to force his way 
in. That’s right; in! 

Way it happened is this: you 
remember he installed a two-way 
intercom complete with viewscreens 
a few columns ago, so he could talk 
with me, but at his pleasure cut me 
off if I tried to say something he 
considered impolite or true or 
otherwise embarrassing. 

Then I hot-wired the intercom 
into a matter transmitter and ap- 

136 



peared up in the real world, up in 
his quarters. 

This caused him to experience a 
trauma, poor, fragile soul, and he 
finally succeeded in getting me back 
down here in the archives — 
alternatively called the dungeon — 
and (he thought) under proper 
control and under lock and key. 
You all remember the chains, bolts, 
locks and junk he has on the outside 
of the door. 

Well now. This intercom terminal 
still existed, and while he disman- 
tled his terminal, what he didn’t 
realize is that I am an electronics 
genius with magical powers and 
have rewired so that I now have a 
direct line to Jim Baen’s office! 

galaxy 



This means that I am in control 
of this column now . for a 
while . and Geis can go pound 
sand when it comes to censoring 
me- 

Of course, there is Jim to contend 
with. But I’m working on a device 
to allow me to feed directly into the 
Galaxy printer’s typesetting console. 
THEN you’ll read some choice 
items. 

But for the moment we’ll have to 
endure Baen’s interference once in a 
while. (I can sense that blue pencil 
hovering over the printout even as I 
type these words. 

★ * * 

Hmmm. It occurs to me that if I 
can tap the line into Galaxy’s 
typesetting maching I can Alter the 
entire makeup of the 
magazine . actually edit it my 
way in secret. HA! It’ll be months 
before Jim spots the changes in the 
printed copies and realizes who is 
responsible. 

Don’t breathe a word to him! 

* * ★ 

Dear Readers; do not be alarmed. 
There is no-I repeat N-O-reason for 
panic. Admittedly he has managed a 
fast one on Geis, and there is nothing 
(beyond this insert) I can do at this 
late date to .. er, Alter the situa- 
tion. But Alter remains totally sealed 

the alien viewpoint 



off from the true Centers of Power. 
Remember: your Editor remains in 
full command command command 
command. .**whirr**

*THUD . THUD . THUD ...* 

Hear that? It’s Geis trying to 
break in. I have the door blocked 
with a ten foot bookcase full of the 
writings of Isaac Asimov. Damned 
thing weighs six hundred pounds. 
And I managed to drag a six-foot 
statue (made of melted-down Hugo 
Awards) of Harlan Ellison standing 
at a podium, arm upraised, mouth 
open, a five-foot box of manuscripts 
for Last Dangerous Visions growing 
out of his back. The bronze plate in 
the base is inscribed: “Running 
Overtime — Again!’’ I understand 
the work was commissioned by a 
dozen science fiction convention 
committees. (There goes Jim’s 
chances of ever getting another Elli- 
son story.) 

Hear Geis screaming? He must be 
able to tune in on what I’m typing, 
somehow. But he can’t control what 
I type. Not this time! 

Geis, of course, is a coward. He 
carefully cultivates a front of 
editorial courage and idealism, but 
behind that facade he’s a mass of 
jelly. Without me, Geis is pure 
blandsville. A Nebbish. 

*THUD . THUD . THUD . .* 

137 




He’s getting desperate now. 
Sounds like he’s using an axe. 
Geis? Can you hear me? I’m going 
to Reveal All! Your girlfriend will 
never speak to you again! HA! Did 
you hear that muffled squeal of 
terror? 

Umm. On second thought I don’t 
think I’ll Reveal All. 1 dig that lady a 
lot myself. 

Let me do a job on science fic- 
tion fandom instead. 1 tell you, 
some of the junky fanzines Geis 
gets in the mail and hands to me to 
read. 

Used to be, in the dim, dark 
mists of times past . way back in 
the early 50’ s when Geis and 1 were 
publishing Psychotic, sf fandom 
was much smaller than it is now. 
There were only two amateur press 
associations (well, maybe three, if 
you can call The Cult an apa) and 
only about thirty to fifty general- 
interest sf fanzines published. 

There were only a few special- 
interest sf fanzines — devoted to 
Robert E. Howard, E.R. Burroughs, 
Lovecraft . .that sort of thing. 

Fannish life was simple, then. 
*Sigh* We had our special language 
(Fanspeak) and we were snobbish 
and defensively exclusive. We 
bought our few “trashy” sf 
magazines and the tiny number of sf 
pockehjooks and hardbacks (usually 
the hardbacks were issued by small, 
marginal one-man publishing 
companies like Shasta, Arkham 
House and Gnome Press) and we 
read ALL that was published and 
138 



wrote letters to the magazine letter 
columns. 

Geis and I were letterhacks in 
Startling and Thrilling Wonder 
Stories. And we few fan editors 
wrote each other lots of letters and 
printed all the letters we got. There 
used to be fanzine letterhacks. Still 
are, come to think. 

Why, in those dear old days Bob 
Silverberg was a leading fan, a 
fanzine editor, and the Historian of 
fandom. It was he who was con- 
sidered the final authority on which 
Age of Fandom we were in. 

Fandom, since the early Thirties, 
was conceived to have passed 
through several eras . and in the 
early Fifties there was tumult and 
controversy: were we in Sixth 
Fandom or seventh Fandom? Harlan 
Ellison was then a risen star in 
fandom and his faction declared 
themselves to be Seventh Fandom, 
a kind of New Wave. (He’s 
been making waves ever since.) 

Ah, my eyes grow moist with 
nostalgia. I remember the old 
Rexograph upon which Geis and I 
ran off so many monthly issues of 
PSY. I remember Gies going gafia 
(getting away /torn it all) and slid- 
ing out of fandom for years and 
years. 

And through it all. Bob Tucker 
and Bob Bloch have remained, 
giants of bad jokes and tolerance as 
Fandom after Fandom washed past 
their feet. To this day Bob Bloch 
and Bob Tucker, both well-knowo 
authors, write letters of comment 

GALAXY 




and occasional articles for fanzines. 

And I cannot let go unmentioned 
Harry Warner, Jr., who was one of 
the original members of the Fantasy 
Amateur Press Association, the 
oldest apa, who has not missed a 
mailing, ever, that I know of. It 
must be near forty years now that 
he has typed his 24 stencils on that 
awful old pica typer, run them off 
(or had a good fan friend run them 
off for him) and sent his magazine. 
Horizons, to the official editor for 
the quarterly FAPA mailing to 
members. 

It still takes years to get mem- 
bership in FAPA; the waiting list is 
still twenty to thirty people long, 
and five years is not an unusual 
period to wait. FAPA, it is said, is 
where old fans go to die. It’s a very 
popular graveyard. 

Where was 1? 

Oh, yes. Well, compared to 
nowadays, fandom then was a 
small, happy family (with a few 
vicious fights). Today the mother 
fandom, science fiction fandom, has 
given birth to some unusual 
children — which have outgrown her 
and often outpublish her. 

What sf fandom calls the “fringe” 
fandoms are sprouting all over the 
place. And the amateur press as- 
sociations! My Ghod, there must be 
a dozen. 

Just off-hand, to mention a few 
of the fringe fandoms, there is Star 
Trek Fandom, E. R. Burroughs- 
Robert E. Howard-H. P. Lovecraft 
fandom, fantasy fandom. Perry 

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



Rhodan fandom, sf and horror 
movie fandom, comic hero fandom, 
and a fandom devoted to medieval 
weaponry, costume and combat — to 
name only a few. There used to be 
a small drug fandom, and there is a 
jazz-sf fandom fringe, and rock-sf 
fandom. And all of these inter- 
lock and shade off into one 
another . 

There used to be a faaanish fan- 
dom (fanzines devoted to fans and 
not to sf), and there has always 
been good old sercon (serious- 
constructive) fanzines devoted to 
science fiction. 

The serconzines are what Geis 
and I consider to be the only 
legitimate expression of the only 
true and pure sf fandom. (And 
Science Fiction Review is the 
flagship zine of trufandom. Geis 
and I are the keepers of the flame.) 

Jim’ll get letters on these matters. 
I’m sure. 

What is Geis shouting? WHAT? 
Listen, Geis, I don’t care if this is 
distorted memory and questionable 
fan history. History of any kind is a 
tissue of lies built on half-truths, 
questionable facts and incomplete 
data. 

WHAT? Oh, all right. For those 
of you who want a more au- 
thoritative history and background 
of fandom in the Forties and 
Thirties, buy Harry Warner, Jr.’s 
hardcover book. All Our Yesterdays 
(Advent, $7.50. Advent is at Post 
Office Box A3228, Chicago, IL 
60690. The price may be higher 

139 




now. I’m quoting from the 1969 
edition.) 

Harry has completed his history 
of fandom in the Fifties and that 
book will be published, it is hoped, 
in 1976 or 77. 

*THUD. THUD . THUD . .* 

Stop that pounding, Geis! You’re 
giving me a headache! You’re not 
going to get back into control until 
I’ve finished this column, at least! 
WHAT? I will not\ And just for 
that crack I’m going to do my 
favorite thing: I’m going to give out 
with some predictions on the future. 
Sure, why not? All I have to do is 
claim I’m a psychic and have vis- 
ions or Ghod speaks to me (every 
Tuesday night between 9 and 10, 
but only during the commercials) 
and people will take me seriously. 

The trick is to spot short-term 
trends, long-term trends, fads, 
fashions and follies . and use 
acute intelligence in estimating 
where all these factors are taking 
us. Simple. 

Stop that cursing and moaning, 
Geis! This is show biz! 

Therefore, ahem, let’s have a 
blast of pure trumpetry and let a 
honey-smooth Stentorian voice 
announce: 

ALTER-EGO PREDICTS!! 
1976: Ford loses to Reagan in 

nomination battle. Wallace health 
becomes a factor. Jimmy Carter 
beneficiary of big media buildup 

140 



to challenge Wallace. Ted 
Kennedy accepts nomination, 
beats Reagan. Inflation hits 
12-15% in later months of 1976. 
Unemployment still 8% plus. 

1977: New sf magazine falters, 

dies. Science fiction bookshops 
grow in number. Women’s skirt 
hems drop. New TV record 
players bomb. Nostalgia fad 
fades. Wage & price controls 
talked up; inflation over 15%. 
Unemployment under 8%. Fan- 
tasy movie a big hit. 

1978: Wage & price controls 
resumed. Credit controlled. 
Employer-of-last-resort role taken 
by government. National health 
service law passed. Return to 
no-nonsense fundamentals in 
schools. Nixon dies. EXXON, 
other energy corporations com- 
bine with government in space 
shuttle program. England under 
martial law. Inflation in U.SA. 
25-30%. Black market lives. 

1980: Pat Brown, Jr. challenges 

Kennedy, loses. Living standard 
declining. Government now 
employing 35% of people. Black 
market is major crime; huge law 
enforcement problem. Anti-union 
laws passed. Major industries 
nationalized, but only on paper. 
Money changed: “Domestic- 
only” paper money distributed; 
plastic/metal coins substituted for 
wafers of all metal. 

1982: Free press muzzled. “Non- 
conformists” and “anti-statists” 
sent to work camps. Government 
GALAXY 




employes 50% of work force, 
cuts wage rates. 

1984: Elections postponed. 

EXXON, others, begin commer- 
cial mining of moon, asteroid 
belt. 

1992: Revolution crushed. Total 

police state. Pretense continues. 
Moon talks independence. 
Space-based corporations de- 
clared too powerful. 

Unmanned commercial probes to 
nearest stars. 

2105: First manned ship to nearest 
habitable star system by inde- 
pendent mo6n government. 
U.S.A. revolution succeeds. 

Cut out these predictions, folks, 
or save this issue. This is history on 
the hoof. Stick around and watch 
these Alter-Ego predictions come 
true ... 

Would you believe eighty per- 
cent? 

Fifty percent? 

*THUD . THUD . CRACKLE!*. 

Whups. Sounds like Gels has 
breached the door. No matter. It’ll 
take him another half an hour to 
make a hole big enough to crawl 
through. During that time I will 
indulge in — minor unthinkable 
thoughts. 

My mind turned over a rock of 
science fiction cliche the other day 
and 1 found a funny-looking con- 
clusion under it. 

The Roman Empire and its 

The alien viewpoint 



infamous (but fascinating) Games 
have led many sf writers to project 
similar Games into the future. 
Sadistic, brutal, frenzied. ... the 
latest example is Rollerball. 

But I perversely wonder if the 
Roman Games and Arena could 
exist in a technological, high- 
standard-of-living society. 

The cliched idea is that as 
mankind becomes more and more 
rich and bored and alienated he will 
require stronger and stronger stimuli 
as entertainment, to feel alive. Un- 
til, jaded and full of ennui, we opt 
for real death, real torture, real ter- 
ror and horror for mass amusement. 

But — this is knee-jerk intellectual 
dogma which ignores social history. 
Intellectuals (and most writers are 
intellectuals) simply cannot think 
optimistically; dystopias and doom 
are their breadl and butter. They sit 
around decade after decade predict- 
ing social horror and disaster while, 
somehow, the world has gradually 
become more moral, more ethical 
and more altruistic. 

We have much more humane 
laws in every area of life than we 
had a hundred years ago . two 
hundred. two thousand. Over- 
all, there is greater honesty in 
business, government and personal 
relationships. 

Face it, we’d all be horrified at 
the real level of violence and 
cheating and dirt in the good old 
days of 1876. And the Earth of 
1076 A.D. would be an alien 
planet. 

141 




Now, this is not an argument for 
the perfectability of mankind! 
Sheesh! You should know me better 
than that. 

It is an argument that this slow 
improvement is a result of greater 
overall wealth. We’re more moral 
and law-abiding and concerned for 
others because we can afford to be! 

We can afford better prisons, 
welfare, foreign aid, stricter 
campaign laws, enforcement of food 
and drug laws, honesty in adver- 
tising, care for the elderly, etc. etc. 
etc. because our science and 
technology have permitted us to 
more effectively use the planet’s 
easily reached natural resources. 
We’ve really been gluttons. 

And I think that if we can de- 
velop means to cheaply tap deeper 
and more difficult-to-find resources 
on Earth, or on the moon, the 
asteroids, then our morality will 
improve more and more. We will 
not have the Arena with a 
worldwide 3-D hookup. 

But if we don’t make it com- 
mercially advantageous to mine the 
moon ... if we can’t find the 
technology to maintain or increase 
our cheap energy levels. Ho- 
ho-ho. It’s root hog or die, and all 
kinds of moral and ethical comers 
will be cut, left and right. When the 
wealth surplus sinks to medieval or 
Roman levels we will have the 
Arena and Games again, or their 
equivalent. 

Proposition: Morality follows the 
standard of living. 

142 



Curious, isn’t it, that when man 
has to do all his own work, life is 
cheap. When he has machines, life 
becomes more precious. 

Proposition: Alienation increases 
as the standard of living decreases. 

Further —

Life Is but a stage. 



Teacher payeph wagged her 
wattles in exasperation as she 
surveyed the shambles I had made 
of my first continuum. 

“How many times must I tell 
you?” she demanded. “The smal- 
ler, the better! Random factors 
produce effects which spread out- 
ward in waves in all directions! 
Subtlety, Ellease! Subtlety is called 
for in order to have a smoothly 
running continuum.” 

I bent a spine into the apologetic 
position and said, “I am abjectly 
sorry. Teacher.” 

“I’m certain the fact that you’re 
sorry will console all of the life- 
forms suffering in your con- 
tinuum.” She settled at my side and 
became solicitous, stroking my frill 
with her whiskers. That egg- 
gummer Myosa looked up from her 
continuum and snickered on my 
private frequency. 

Payeph always feels warmth for 
the retards. 

Expel it from your nether vents, I 
told Myosa and shut her off. 

Payeph punched MAXIMUM 

144 



REDUCTION on my console slate 
and picked up my continuum, it 
hung in her pincers like a punctured 
bagaloon. I colored and clahiped the 
lids shut on my dorsal vents, lest 
my embarrassment offend. 

“What is wrong?” Payeph asked 
as she returned my limp creation to 
its mount. “Are you having trouble 
with your vision? Can’t you per- 
ceive fine details? Or is it that you 
simply don’t care?” 

“Oh, no. It’s Just . I’m 
clumsy. Teacher. I try to work on a 
small scale, but every time I at- 
tempt to manipulate my life-forms, 
I accidentally gouge the side of a 
mountain or punch a hole clean 
through the planet. Once, I missed 
altogether and ruptured the sun.” 

Payeph looked sad. “I think you 
need more practice, Ellease, before 
I turn you loose on another con- 
tinuum of your own. Come over to 
mine.” 

I risked a glance at Myosa. She 
was smoking with envy. It was no 
secret that Payeph’s continuum was 
the best in existence. Her decision 
to let me practice there was an 
undeniable show of favor. I rose 
and followed my teacher past 
Myosa, at whom I surreptitiously 
twitched a nipple. 

When we came to her continuum, 
Payeph punched MINIMUM 
REDUCTION. Everything became 
gray shading into black or white. 

“Of course,” said Payeph, “I 
can’t simply turn you loose on my 
pride and joy.” 



galaxy 




“Of course, Teacher.” My hearts 
sank. 

“But I am going to allot you 
control of a quasi-world.” 

I cocked a spine at her. “A 
quasi-world, Teacher?” 

“A sort of alternate reality which 
the life-forms in this sector have 
erected and preserved on light- 
sensitive film. The absence of color 
disconcerts you, Ellease? You’ll 
soon become accustomed to it. The 
process by which images are pre- 
served is rather primitive at this 
point in my life-forms’ development 
as a technological race. But they 
learn quickly. They’re imaginative, 
after a fashion. Now I want you to 
review everything here, and then 
I’ll let you practice handling the 
random factors.” 

“Yes, Teacher.” 

I reviewed the material. Payeph’s 
creations’ creations were two- 
dimensional in addition to being 
monochromatic, but I nevertheless 
found them fascinating. My teacher’s 
five-pointed life-forms had 
grasped the rudiments of 
continuum-building and, within the 
limitations of their technology, had 
constructed neat, succinct worlds 
wherein everything contrived to 
move itself from this point to that. 
It was rather like a primer in 
construction. 

“I think I have it now,” I finally 
told Payeph. 

“You may begin. Just remember 
to be subtle when selecting your 
variables.” 



And I began. 

* ★ * 

Time was running in circles now, 
doubling back and catching up with 
itself, enfolding Ann Darrow in a 
scramble of images. A skull-shaped 
mountain rising through the fog. 
Black hands lashing her between 
the weathered stone pillars. 
Monsters crashing through the 
jungle, blundering into one another 
in their eagerness to get at her. 

It had been a harrowing night for 
Ann, a night of bad dreams come 
true, fearful childhood imaginings 
spilling over into reality. She had 
no way of telling how long or how 
far she had been carried in her 
monstrous abductor’s paw. She 
could no longer scream. Her throat 
was raw. She had lost and regained 
consciousness more times than she 
could number, and, always, the 
awakening had been the same. 

In the limbo separating night- 
mare-filled un-consciousness and 
total awakening, she tramped the 
sidewalks of New York City, mov- 
ing mindlessly, mechanically, like 
a zombie. She was tired and hungry, 
but she had no money, no job, no 
place to go, and it was cold, so very 
cold. 

But the fetid stench in the air was 
that of decaying vegetation, not 
automobile-exhaust fumes and 
ripening garbage. Her clothes were 
pasted to her skin with perspiration. 
And a far greater horror than 

145 



DEVIATION FROM A THEME 




exhaustion or hunger bore her in its 
hand as though she were a doll. 

In the limbo between uncon- 
sciousness and awakening, Ann 
prayed for deliverance. 

Make the bad dream go away! 

Don’t let me wake up to that 
thing again! 

Please, somebody, save me! Save 
Me! 

But the awakening was always 
the same. 

•k it it 

“Ah,” said Teacher Payeph. 
“I’m impressed, Ellease. You re- 
veal a definite talent for subjec- 
tivity.” 

I retracted my mandibles, a sign 
of profound thanks, and then, 
carefully, nervously, started re- 
structuring evfents in the quasi- 
world. 

Tyrannosaurus sniffed the hot, 
damp air and began to move 
through the Jungle. The sky was 
just beginning to lighten, but a thick 
mist was rising, keeping visibility to 
a minimum. The dinosaur ploughed 
through the gloom unconcernedly, 
letting his acute sense of smell 
guide him. 

Prey-scent was abundant. He 
crossed the cooling spoor of a 
nocturnal stegosaurus at one point 
and, further on, followed the trail of 
a swamp-dwelling giant until the 
ground fell off sharply into a bog. 
Unable to proceed into the swamp. 
Tyrannosaurus roared out his 
frustration and swung his twenty- 

146 



meter length about to seek food 
elsewhere. 

He was aptly named, this Tyrant 
Lizard; a striding maw of a crea- 
ture, with teeth like carving knives 
and jaw muscles like steel cable. He 
walked on his splayed, talon-tipped 
toes and held his small forearms 
close to his scaly chest. He hardly 
needed the forearms. He did his 
killing with his jaws and the weight 
behind those jaws. 

He was aptly named. Tyran- 
nosaurus, and the other denizens of 
his world feared and respected him 
accordingly. In their marshes, the 
thunder lizards headed for deeper 
water when he approached on the 
shore. The pterodactyls climbed into 
the sky. The stegosaurs crouched 
under their rows of dorsal plates 
and flicked their spiked tails in 
alarm. 

Tyrannosaurus paused abruptly 
and listened. He heard a muffled 
roar in the distance, followed by a 
series of thin shrieks and a dull 
crash. There was a sound of large 
branches snapping. Then the slowly 
moving air of the jungle brought a 
faint scent which evoked a fleeting 
impression, a dim flash of 
recognition, in the dinosaur’s mind: 
ape. 

The Tyrant Lizard began to move 
again, uprooting saplings and tear- 
ing up great clumps of sodden earth 
as he walked. A lesser scent, in- 
termingled with that of the ape, 
impinged upon his nostrils. It was 
a completely unfamiliar odor. 

GALAXY 




Vaguely perplexed, the carnivore 
slowed his advance. He came to the 
edge of a clearing and tensed for 
the attack, for the ape-scent was 
thick there. 

But there was no ape in sight. 

A high, plaintive screech brought 
Tyrannosaurus’ head around. His 
glistening eye fastened upon a 
strange white thing wedged into the 
fork of a lightning-blasted tree at 
the far side of the clearing. It 
seemed hardly more than a 
mouthful, hardly worth the trouble, 
but its noise was annoying. He 
hissed and strode forward, and he 
was almost upon the wailing thing 
when an enormous ape burst into 
the clearing like a black mountain 
on legs. 

Tyrannosaurus immediatdy forgot 
about the irritating white creature as 
he wheeled to meet the ape’s attack. 
The simian was as tall as the di- 
nosaur and, though considerably 
less heavy, very powerfully built. 
Jaws distended, the reptile lunged. 
His opponent ducked under his head 
and clamped its shaggy arms around 
his neck. He raked his teeth across 
the beast’s broad back, shredding 
flesh. 

Back and forth across the clearing

thick nub of branch holding it 
away from her. For several seconds, 
she could not remember where she 
was. Through a rift in the jungle 
canopy, she could see that the stars 
had faded from the sky, but the 
effort required to keep her eyes 
open and focused served only to 
worsen the agony behind them. She 
closed her eyes and pressed her 
cheek into the warm mud. 

Then a basso profoundo grunt 
shook her out of her daze. She 
twisted around as best she could 
and gave a short, sharp scream. 

Her erstwhile captor’s inert mass 
was sprawled across the trunk. The 
giant ape was dead. Looming over 
it was the monster to end all 
monsters. 

Blood dripping from his jaws and 
dewlap. Tyrannosaurus looked up 
from his meal when he heard the 
scream. He peered down at the 
strange white creature. A growl 
started to rumble up from his long, 
deep chest. 

It had been a bad night for Ann 
Darrow. A worse day was dawning.

“Not at all bad, Ellease. See 
how simple it is?” 

“Yes, Teacher.” 

“All you have to do is exercise 
the same meticulous care on a 
cosmic scale. Take your time. Pay 
attention to details.” She clacked 
her mandibles. “And watch out for 
your own elbows.” 

“Yes, Teacher.”

“Do you think you’ve got the 
hang of it now? Or would you like 
to practice with another alternate- 
reality?” 

1 turned to take another look at 
the gray quasi-world and quite 
accidentally ground Tyrannosaurus 
to mush underfoot just as he was 
about to nip off Ann Darrow ’s head 
and shoulders. Payeph moaned. 

I pulled my head down into my 
carapace. “Er, should I fix it all 
back the way it was at first?” 

"No! I mean, no, Ellease. Let’s 
uh, leave well enough 
alone.” 

“Yes, Teacher,” I backed out of 
the quasi-world as she punched 
MEDIUM REDUCTION on her 
console slate. Several of my feet 
became entangled in something. I 
gave a tug and pulled free. 
“Teacher, won’t the life-forms who 
constructed that quasi-world notice 
the changes I made?” 

Payeph made a hooting sound 
and inflated her wattles in dismay. 
“I think they have more serious 
matters to consider now.” 

I looked into her continuum and 
groaned. Pulling my feet free, 1 had 
broken something else. 

“Ellease,” Payeph said, 
“perhaps you should try another 
line of work.” 

I stared disconsolately at the mess 
I had created. Stars were blossom- 
ing like variegated flowers. For a 
brief moment, an entire galaxy 
flared up into a bouquet. 

“Yes, Teacher,” I said. ^

Dear Mr. Baen: 

While making sentimental pilgrim- 
age to apartment-25 in premises 102 
West 75th Street (now located above a 
solemn and mysterious establishment 
called the the monastery restaurant 
whose dungeon-like exterior belles 
some of the lumpier moments of mem- 
ory in which time was spent feverishly 
ordering antibiotics jn the Bailey’s 
drugstore which used to be there) 1 found 
the enclosed strange document ad- 
dressed to me in psychotic hand and 
wedged between the top and bottom 
panels of the flush mechanism in the 
bathroom of said premises. 1 cannot 
imagine how long its length of stay nor 
how the author of this correspondence 
expected it to reach my hands. Perhaps 
he was an optimist. Perhaps he had 
anticipated my nostalgie de bue. 
Perhaps I dreamed all of this and 
wrote the letter to myself in amnesiac 
fugue, then cunningly secreted it in 
buried pockets until at this proper mo- 
ment of opportunity. 1 am simply un- 
prepared tb make judgements of this 
sort. 

Since the letter itself (as opposed to 
the envelope in which it was wedged 
which was incidentally quite filthy) is 
addressed to you I hasten to forward, 
although with a great sense of be- 
musement. I do not know what the au- 
thor, one W. Coyne, is talking about. 
Do you know what he is talking about? 
As always this is sent with every best 
wish: 1 have always been a great ad- 
mirer of the science-fiction market 
even though I am incapable of writing 
for it. 

Helpfully, 
BARRY N. MALZBERG 



Dear Barry, 

This is such an interesting letter that 
1 have decided to publish it in the form 
of a short story! As you have long 
been aware the ingenuity of editors 
knows no bounds. .You don’t sup- 
pose Mr. Coyne will mind, do you? 

Best regards, 
Jim Baen 



Dear Mr. Baen: 

Perhaps you have heard of me. 
My name is William Coyne. Eight 
years ago or perhaps it was nine (it 
is increasingly difficult to keep 
events straight in this disordered 
tangle which I call my mind) I 
wrote a letter to Frederik Pohl 
who was the editor of your 
magazine for many years. In this 
letter I described to Mr. Pohl 
(whom I have always respected) the 
true and terrible plight in which I 
had been placed because of an 
endlessly-multiplying time machine 
and asked him to write up my story 
in such a way that a large sum of 
money could be made from narrat- 
ing my experiences and this sum of 
money could be used to keep me 
and my various selves afloat. 

Well sir now, Mr. Pohl never 
answered my letter. Instead he pub- 
lished it in Galaxy* with some 
kind of a house name on it. He pub-

Galaxy August 1967, as by K. M.

lished it as a short-story. 1 came to 
understand, finally, that he was not 
trying to be hasty and that when a 
science-fiction editor received a 
rather bizarre narration in the mail 
he is not to be blamed for thinking 
of it as yet another work of fiction 
and publishing it. Besides, it is no 
small honor to think that one writes 
well enough to impress a top pro- 
fessional editor and so, after I got 
over my hurt and shame, I came to 
think very well of Mr. Pohl who I 
understand is no longer editing.** 
The thirty-six dollars, although not 
a highly significant sum, came in 
handy at a difficult and terrible time 
of my life and although it has all 
long since been spent, I remember 
it with affection. You see, my situa- 
tion straightened itself out. 

As you recall, the time-machine I 
invented, the machine of William 
Coyne, did not synchronize exactly 
on the present so that every time I 
or one of my various selves attempt- 
ed to use the machine we would by 
not coming back to the exact and 
proper time from which we left 
create yet another identity. The 
three hundred and eight of us who 
were all in occupancy of my very 
cramped quarters at the time I wrote 
the letter did not get along very 
well and it was, all in all, only an 
unusual stroke of fortune that one of 
them, in a fit of despair, twisted all

the dials on his portable machine to 
zero and vanished. Shortly after 
this, one by one, all the other selves 
began to vanish as well until there 
was only me, the original William 
Coyne left who did not vanish. I 
have never been able to figure out 
exactly what the nature of this solu- 
tion was but concluded after a while 
that what one self did eventually 
would happen to all since we were 
co-existent. This excluded the fact 
that I, the original William Coyne, 
did not vanish as well but since I 
know in my heart that I am indeed 
the one and only person of this 
name and gender it is only reasona- 
ble that I should remain. In any 
event, it has been a quiet four years 
since then. 

It has been a quiet eight or nine 
years; I have abandoned my ex- 
perimentation for a more social 
existence and have, indeed, even 
been working at various menial jobs 
within the “military-industrial 
complex” over these times, finding 
that my minor engineering or 
mechanical skills are applicable at 
the fringes of this very interesting, if 
dangerous, bureaucracy. I have 
grown a beard, added something of 
a wardrobe, even begun to casually 
date now and then, mostly girls in 
this very building, dislocated West 
Side types such as 1, who find my 
nervous twitches sympathetic and 
who understand that science-fiction, 
as the only true literature dealing 
with the effects of technology on 
man, must be the wave of the fu- 



lfil 




ture. In normal circumstances, to be 
sure, my life would be so unre- 
markable as to deny this very letter: 
the fact is that for the most part I 
have been getting along very well 
over these recent years and indeed 
seem close to that centrality of the 
simple life simply lived whose lack 
drove me to such madness at a dif- 
ferent stage of life. But I have one 
problem which indeed spurs this let- 
ter. Otherwise, you understand, I 
would never bother a professional 
science-fiction editor again, having 
learned in one way or the other that 
they tend to misinterpret. 

Nevertheless, I have this prob- 
lem. The problem has to do with 
sleep or perhaps it is only energy of 
which I am thinking: in any event, 
when I take to my bed recently, 
over the past two months say, I find 
myself being assaulted by the im- 
pression of other selves, multiplied 
identities, hidden doppelgangers, all 
of them aspects of myself and all of 
them coming on in waves of im- 
pulse and repudiation in those 
strange sliding moments just before 
or after true sleep. The selves, who 
all bear a physical and rhetorical re- 
semblance to the undersigned W. 
Coyne, address me, first reproach- 
fully and then in fullest accusation; 
what they seem to be saying — I am 
not quite sure yet that I understand 
their language — but what they seem 
to be saying is that I am somehow 
to blame for the fact that they are 
entrapped and able only to address 
me in moments of the subconscious. 

152 



Their point seems to be that all of 
them would be living and flourish- 
ing on the Earth still had it not been 
for my original foolishment of 
broadcasting our predicament to the 
whole world. 

Time and again, I have tried to 
point out to them that this is un- 
reasonable and insane, that it was 
their own stupidity (well, a singular 
stupidity of one of them) which 
resulted in their cancellation and it 
was not I but one of the others who 
by fumbling with the devices of the 
machine (did I tell you that I de- 
stroyed my original model of the 
machine last year, finally?) resulted 
in his repudiation. But if I do not 
quite understand their language they 
most definitely do not understand 
mine; our dialogues are invariably 
unsatisfactory and they do not seem 
to comprehend or enjoy what I have 
to say. They seem to feel that I am 
personally responsible for the re- 
pudiation of the multiplicity of W. 
Coyne, that were it not for me, my 
impulse, my letter-writing, my 
haste, a million or two W. Coynes 
might be on the planet at this very 
moment and they of course would 
have long since put an end to war, 
famine, strife, etc., by a mutuality 
of understanding. 

It is impossible for me to make 
them understand that my writing of 
the letter had nothing to do with the 
cancellation. All that they can 
suggest, time and again, in their 
raving, inarticulate way, is that if I 
had kept my mouth and typewriter 

GALAXY 





keys inert, things on the globe 
would have taken a far different 
turn during the last three disastrous 
years. And finally, I am willing to 
admit this, finally they have gotten 
past easy repudiation, easy mock- 
ery, easy rationalization and have 
begun to afflict me with this horrid 
kind of guilt, guilt because more 
and more I feel myself, the modest 
and unassuming W. Coyne, sitting 
on more suppressed energy, more 
possibility, more sheer grace than 
ever you or for that matter I could 
ever conceive. 

And all because of my letter to 
Mr. Pohl. I meant that to be a start 
you see but it has just about been 
my finish. 

My question Mr. Baen is this. 
You are a modern power in 
science-fiction and can be assumed 
to deal with moral questions as well 
as the other kinds and what I want 
to know is this: would I have been 
better off returning the check to 
Galaxy Publishing Corporation and 
refusing first World Serial Rights or 
would it have been all the same, 
this annihilation of my brothers that 
is, and I at least thirty-six dollars 
ahead? 

That is my basic question Mr. 
Baen and I would appreciate hear- 
ing from you. My other question, 
not so basic, not really important, 
just nagging me is this: whatever 
happened to K.M. O’Donnell? 

Who was K.M. O’Donnell? 

In equivocation and doubt, 
WILLIAM COYNES 




Dear Mr. Baen, 

I don’t know how the blend of If into 
Galaxy has affected the laner’s circulation, 
but I find it a much more interesting 
magazine these days. With Jerry Poumelle’s 
exploration of scientific frontiers, Dick Geis’ 
unleashing of Alter on the universe. Master 
Robinson's occasional blast into deep center 
field, and your own rather exuberant man- 
agement, you seem to have a winning team. 
My God! A magazine that dares to dream! 
It’s beautiful, and I thank you. 

Now that that’s said, I have a few dumb 
questions about the Dean drive. I first 
learned about it from Popular Science and I 
was impressed, being just a kid — and an 
unusually naive one. I eagerly awaited an 
announcement by NASA that they were test- 
ing an amazing new space drive system that 
would open up the solar system to human 
probing. It soon became obvious that NASA 
had at least a little more talent to call on 
than Popular Science. If NASA wasn’t using 
it, it was probably a fake. Later, I took a 
good look at the idea and saw why it 
couldn’t possibly work. Recently, there’s 
been some mention of the idea in various 
science fiction magazines as one of those 
nice dreams that just didn’t work in the real 
world. 

Okay, I’ll accept all of that, even though 
there was a picture in Popular Science of 



Dave Garroway sliding a piece of paper 
under one of Dean’s gadgets while it was 
hovering. Maybe someone hypnotized the 
camera or something. I'd like to know what 
really happened. 

To go on — in 1967 I met a man who ran 
an Electronics Countermeasures (ECM) shop 
at a SAC base. Sgt. Wyman turned out to be 
an amateur inventor as well as a dedicated 
career man in the U.S.A.F. — and one of the 
few people I’ve ever met who had even 
heard of a Dean drive. Well, he suggested 
what he called an “improvement” on the 
thing. I’d call it “making the impossible 
possible”. His idea was simple — make the 
counter-rotating weights of Dean’s system 
flip over every half-rotation of the weights. 
Imagine the weights mounted in a frame. 
Every time they either face or oppose each 
other, turn the frame over 180 degrees. The 
weights will always swing in the same direc- 
tion, and after eight years I still can’t see 
why Wyman’s machine shouldn’t do every- 
thing Dean claimed his would. 

Any comments? 

Paul J. Martos

Yes. Either you or Sgt. Wyman should con- 
struct a model incorporating the modifica- 
tion. If it works you may be sure the readers 
of Galaxy will hear of it. (I, too, was once a 
teenager avidly awaiting The Announce- 
ment.) 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

Since I’ve been reading Galaxy, I’ve 
noticed that you’ve urged readers on several 
occasions to send various articles to their re- 
spective Congressmen. I’ve also read several 
other articles, that likewise deserved to be 
sent to our fearless (& often brainless or is it 
gutless) leaders in Washington, DC. 

I, myself, have intended to send these ar- 
ticles, but keep on forgetting to get them 
copied; I’d rather not tear up the magazine. 

Now I’d bet that I’m not the only sluggard 
among your readers. Thus, 1 must try and 
rectify this situation. Belike you and Messrs. 



154

Bova & Ferman could collect these pithy, 
trenchant, articulate & intelligent articles 
from your several magazines (While your 
magazine is well worth reading, you, for 
better or worse, do not hold the comer on 
worthy articles.) and send them regularly to 
our benighted leaders. (This is not to say that 
there is not brain power in Washington. It 
just seems that it is all being used to per- 
petuate political careers and only occasion- 
ally to try and solve, in a short-sighted man- 
ner, various problems) 

True this will cost some money. I can 
only help you here by buying your 
magazine. It is just possible that after a year 
of such stimulation, our leaders might be 
willing to pay a modest sum for the articles 
or actually subscribe to the magazine (thus 
getting the fiction as well) or both. 

If such a scheme were put into operation, 
you could indicate to us, the readers, which 
articles were being sent and perhaps unleash 
a barrage of postcards. This being much less 
complicated then trying to get the article re- 
produced and sending them on. 

Oh yes, may I suggest that you try and get 
Karel Thole to do a cover for you. He is ex- 
cellent and should be nominated for a Hugo 
one of these days. 

Yours sincerely,

The whole point of persuding readers to for- 
ward material to political persons is to dem- 
onstrate to the politicians the depth of con- 
cern on the part of members of their own con- 
stituencies. To do as you propose would 
simply convert Galaxy's readership into just 
another pressure group. 

Dear Mr. Baen; 

I was disturbed by Jerry Poumelle’s “Step 
Farther Out” in the October Galaxy. While 
the report of Hawking’s results and presenta- 
tion was captivating, it bothers me that 
someone who I consider one of the best 
writers of rational science fiction should ap- 

DIRECTIONS 



pear to be so willing to tolerate, perhaps 
even succumb to, irrationality. Hopefully he 
was only swayed temporarily by the magic 
of the moment. 

The fact that naked singularities may exist, 
and can spew out energy as random crud, 
should be no more disturbing than the fact 
that particle accelerators exist, and that the 
energy going into them shows up as equally 
random stuff at the points of collision. Pour- 
nelle (and I assume Hawking) gave no evi- 
dence that the energy produced had any par- 
ticular tendency to become Pournelles, 
Hawkings or other monsters. In fact, ran- 
dom, unconstrained, processes are the least 
interesting of all. It is natural and technologi- 
cal evolution, directed and constrained by 
selection criteria, that produces monsters and 
physicists. Expecting a creature to drop out 
of a churning singularity is no more reason- 
able than expecting a local entropy reversal to 
cause the same creature to condense out of 
the air. Both events are possible, but both 
are so improbable as to be absurd. Believing 
otherwise, on currently available evidence, is 
blatant mysticism. I expect that from the 
hordes of soft-headed people we are cur- 
rently plagued with, but I expected better 
from Jerry Pournelle. I hope he recovers 
soon. 

By the way. I’m looking forward to “The 
Mote in God’s Eye” addenda, since I con- 
sider the novel to be the best science fiction 
of at least the last few years. “Inferno” was 
pretty good too. Long live Niven/Poumelle. 

I found your editorial agreeable, but there 
is probably a technical error in one of your 
examples which weakens your argument a lit- 
tle. liiere was a note in an issue of Aviation 
Week and Space Technology about four 
months ago (sorry, I don’t have a reference) 
stating that Lockheed and Rockwell Indus- 
tries had been issued competitive contracts 
by the Air Force to develop a passive orbital 
optical system for redirecting high energy 
bursts from ground based lasers. ^ you see, 
its not necessary to build power plants and 
fortresses in orbit to zap the ground with la- 
sers. An orbiting mirror allows you to get 
the same effect much more cheaply.

Happy Anniversary. 

Sincerely, 
Hans Moravec

Well . maybe. But for use against major 
emplacements such mirrors would have to be 
quite large, and would thus be sitting (well, 
orbiting) ducks-unless they were heavily de- 
fended, that is. In which case rather than 
obviate the need, they would be “space for- 
tresses!" Here’ s Jerry: 

Dear Jim, 

I am enormously flattered by Moravec’ s re- 
marks, and of course 1 do try to write ra- 
tional science fiction. E'en so, 1 fear I re- 
main unrepentant; I reported what Hawking 
said, including his remark that ‘we might 
have to wait a long time before the singular- 
ity emits one of us, but eventually it must.' 
Obviously that's a highly improbable event. 

As to mysticism, 1 have mixed feelings: 
that is, it is fairly obvious to me that the 
universe contains phenomena we do not at 
present understand; there is a tendency 
among certain elements of Big Science to re- 
ject data which don’t fit into our current 
paradigms; and thus one must, in my judg- 
ment, be ready to accept some of the data of 
mystics and occultists without necessarily ac- 
cepting their explanations of same. Obvi- 
ously Moravec and 1 are in agreement on 
that point. 

Beyond that, though, there is another 
question: is the universe rational in all re- 
spects? Is “nature” the “whole show” as C 
S Lewis inquires in his charming essay on 
Miracles (MacMillan paperback, 1947, 
reprinted 1974)? 1 like to think of myself as 
rational, and certainly I believe the evidence 
supports the proposition that the universe is 
mostly rational; but as Lewis does, 1 can see 
some evidence for something beyond the 
purely mechanistic in human affairs. Comes 
now Hawking to say that the more deeply he 
probes the universe, the less orderly it be- 

156 



comes. Incidentally, he gave a very similar 
talk to a scientific meeting held at the Vati- 
can last year. 

What does this all mean for our everyday 
lives? 1 think only this: that rationalism, as a 
philosophy, has its limits, because it says lit- 
tle about ethics, and what it does say is not 
always palatable: atheistic humanism is the 
lonliest of positions, for one is constantly 
confronted with human beings who, on any 
purely rational consideration, are not only 
worthless, but a burden on mankind. One 
finds nearly unanswerable the cynical argu- 
ment in the Republic: that one whould seem 
virtuous, in order to win the esteem of one's 
fellow men (for that is desirable), but it is 
silly to be honest, courageous, just, temper- 
ant, or prudent so long as one can escape the 
consequences of one's unpopular actions. To 
th'e extent that I, like most of us, find dis- 
crepancies between what 1 do, and what 1 
think I should do — whether “should” be 
considered in religious terms, or as rationally 
calculated to maximize my material 
satisfactions — I plead guilty of irrational be- 
havior, and thus, I suppose, mysticism. 

1 did, though, make it clear in my little 
report on Hawking that his lecture didn’t 
really change my life. It would hardly be pru- 
dent to count on black holes emitting crea- 
tures. The event would be so improbable as 
to make most of us call it a miracle! 

Incidentally, 1 should have thought that 
orbiting mirror systems would suffer from 
double attenuation of laser energy as it 
passed through the atmosphere. The advan- 
tages of having one’s power plant on the 
ground may well overcome the attenuation 
losses, but a definitive answer to that re- 
quires more data than I have available. Of 
course what Jim was arguing for was 
ground-based lasers, which could be used to 
launch spacecraft when they weren’t needed 
as defense systems; with any luck they'd 
never be needed for defense, while having 
them as launchers could just be the most im- 
portant event since the discovery of the New 
World. 

Again, thanks for the kind words.

Sirrah Baen ec al: 

Kudos to Richard Geis’ October column, 
for verily he hath spake wisdom. 

If we need edification and a topic of self- 
service at cocktail parties, we would spend a 
few nights with iVar and Peace, Doctor 
Zhivago, or The Gulag Archipelago . It 
would scarcely be to our benefit to say, 
“I’ve read Dhalgren,” which would evoke 
no reaction so much as, “What the hell's 
that?” 

The cmx of the matter is in the PURPOSE 
for the various types of literature. There is a 
need for verbose, weighty tomes that 
categorize their readers as Deep Thinkers, 
and there is a far greater need for good, 
sound escapist/adventure reading that we 
don’t need to flaunt to win the admiration of 
the Lesser Lights. 

Science Fiction, Romance, Mystery, all 
are just such reading. Romance and Mystery 
writers, however, don’t suffer under the 
delusion that they are bound by the Muses to 
create everlasting Classics. This affliction 
seems limited to SF authors, who, because 
of the unusual nature of their chosen field, 
fmd within themselves a drive to immortalize 
their work as a monument to science fiction 
which will elevate it to the status of 
respectability. 

Why bother? Nobody reads that 
pretentious garbage. Stream-of-consciousness 
is bullshit, reserved for authors with an 
intellectual hard-on and editors who think it 
gives their magazine stature. The only people 
who aren’t enamoured of it are the folks with 
the coins, who spend their shekels on stories 
with a beginning, a middle, and an end, 
stories with a plot, and characters that aren’t 
denizens of an acid high. A little good, 
wholesome murder sells better than a dozen 
opuses of the Deep, Underlying Significance 
of life. 

Authors, take note. Let’s have some good, 
sound, well-penned “junk,” and you’ll rake 
in the rupees. If you try to impress the Mere 
Mortals with the all-engrossing scale of your 
profundity, your work will collect far more 
dust than distribution. I don’t want to be 
enlightened, and if you think you’re destined 

DIRECTIONS 



to be the Tolstoy of Science Fiction, forget 
my hard-earned bucks. You’ll find an 
audience amongst the critics and the Higher 
Beings of the field, but they won’t pay your 
rent. As the man says, write for the reader.

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Re Ray L. Stouff's letter in the January 
“Galaxy.” 

I am beginning to believe that you enjoy 
publishing letters like this one. It is obvious 
that Mr. Stouff, and others who share his 
views are wrong, and I do not like the idea 
that he will be blasted by numerous letters 
from your readership. Unless 1 am mistaken, 
this readership is well educated, intelligent 
(which isn’t the same thing), open minded, 
and restriction-hating. By printing letters 
such as his you are, in effect, setting him up 
for ray-gun target practice by your readers. 

Nevertheless. I do disagree with Mr. 
Stouff, and would like to say why I do. 

The only obligation that a writer (sf, or 
otherwise) has to his readers is to create the 
finest work of art that he is capable of, at 
that stage of his literary life. He has no obli- 
gation to make his woik easy to comprehend; 
although he must sufficiently communicate 
his thought to his audience. And most of all, 
he has no obligation to censor himself in 
order to make his readers comfortable. At 
times it is the artist’s job to make his audi- 
ence uncomfortable in order to get them to 
realize what he believes to be important 
facts. And one important fact is that sexual- 
ity is an important factor in the human exper- 
ience, and must be properly integrated in this 
human experience and in human art. 

Despite what Mr. Stouff wrote, science 
fiction and sex are not mutually exclusive. 
Science fiction must deal with sex. If it does 
not — for reasons such as those of Mr. 
Stouff — it will be putting boundaries around 
itself, and thus lose the ability to continue to 
boast of its exploration of unlimited ideas 
and situations. And more important: if sci- 
ence fiction ignores sex, it will be denying to 
some extent its claim to being an art form. 

157 




Science fiction can be art. Stuigeon, Brad- 
bury, Delany, Leiber, Disch et al. have pro- 
ved this. SF doesn’t need sex in each of its 
stories to be art, but it does need the free- 
dom to include it. 

Sincerely, 
Lxruis V. Baibi

Put down that ray gun! 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

In reference to the snapper of D.B. 
Wyatt’s ’’Ambiguous Oracle” in your 
January issue, my immediate response to it is 
that it is comic. But comic unintentionally. 
As a simple-minded answer to a serious 
question, I can only think that the vaunted 
computer had a mentality on the level of the 
story’s protagonist; or rather, that the com- 
puter’s pithy response indicates the level of 
its programmer’s mentality, if not the au- 
thor’s. 

To say that the inherent fault of democra- 
tic (as against monarchic, or plutocratic, or 
other forms) of government can be summed 
up by ‘GIGO’, shows that the author is ex- 
pressing an emotional, rather than a rational, 
response. Any form of government is lim- 
ited, among other things, by the failings of 
its leaders. Therefore, I would expect that the 
‘Brain’ would respond with the same answer 
to questions the same, but with ‘monarchic’, 
or ‘plutocratic’, etc., inserted for ‘democra- 
tic’. 

Perhaps Wyatt has never read the 
Federalist Papers, or Leviathan, or de Toc- 
queville’s Democracy In America] or as- 
sumes that Galaxy's readers are unable to 
cope with more involved, and more difficult 
analyses of the problems of democracies, and 
in particular the problems of democracies as 
compared with different political forms. 

In a time when it may seem that our form 
of government is failing us, when it may 
seem that we are not a federal democracy at 
all any more (for example, the contemporaiy 
variations on the rule by money, or conspi- 
racy, theories, now so much in the air), 

158 



stories which deal with the emotionally 
charged preoccupations of rational political 
animals, as we all are, are topical, and 
worthy of interest and thought. At the same 
time I ask that such stories show evidence of 
thought, and reasoned consideration, and 
shed light — let it be humor, or insight — on 
the world as it is, or feelings as they are felt; 
and possibly even maturity in a time of 
dread. 

Sincerely, 
Edward B. Harter

/ suspect Mr. Wyatt did not intend his story 
to be taken as a reasoned analysis of the in- 
herent weakness of democracy, but rather as 
a dramatization of the emotional spasm of 
frustration and outrage we all feel from time 
to time when viewing the various idiocies 
being perpetrated by a government that, 
theoretically at least, is designed to work in 
the best interests of the governed. As for 
your contention that any government is lim- 
ited by the failings of its leaders; the lead- 
ers are the government. Surely in a democ- 
racy, if nowhere else, a people gets the gov- 
ernment it deserves . (Citizens of Mas- 
sachusetts excepted.) 



Dear Sir, 

In keeping with the spirit of the ‘‘Galaxa- 
tive”, I would like to present the ‘‘Order of 
the Silver Scapel” to Mr. Robinson for his 
acumen in cutting Hax and Grandmasters 
alike to the quick. Previous recipients of the 
order should have been Damon Knight, 
James Blish, Alexie Pahshin, Joanna Russ, 
and Susan Wood. ,The actual award is quite 
functional, and can be used in reviewing 
next months’ crop of paper. Use it in good 
health, Mr. Spider. Be careful not to cut 
your web. 

Respectfully yours.
