Ode to a Skylark 



T he not-quite yet city of Tampeta, 
Florida, described in this issue’s 
The Imperial Stars, is Doc Smith’s 
conception of what will happen to 
Manatee County and surrounding 
areas in another couple of centur- 
ies. It is in this area of Florida’s 
Golf coast, stretching from Dunedin 
and Tampa on the north to Sarasota 
on the south, that Smith spends his 
winters; it was here that he wrote 
The Imperial Stars; and, in fact, it 
is in this same area that your editor 
is writing these notes. 

Yesterday we spent the day with 
Doc Smith, clearing up a few loose 
ends in his forthcoming, long-delay- 
ed and long-awaited conclusion of 
his famous Skylark series, Skylark 
DuQuesne, which we will be print- 
ing in If as soon as the Heinlein 
FarnhairCs Freehold and one or two 
other items are done. (If you think 
we’re name-dropping — we are! It 
isn’t often that an editor has a 
chance to announce a lineup like 
this!) Doc had a bit of eye surgery 
come up — complains somebody 
has stuck about a 30% neutral gray 
filter on his vision when he wasn’t 
looking — and at the pleading of his 
doctor has agreed to budget a few 
weeks for operation and convales- 
cence. But we talked mostly about 
the future — Skylark DuQuesne, 
the future d’Alembert Family ser- 



ies to follow The Imperial Stars and 
so on. Doc, who has been writing 
for all but half a century, has plenty 
of future to count on, and we’re 
hoping to keep printing his stories 
for half a century more. Hail to thee, 
blithe spirit! And keep ’em coming. 
* * * 

In case you hadn’t noticed, this 
is an All-Smith issue ... all differ- 
ent Smiths, of course. Besides Doc 
Smith we’ve got Mister and pro- 
fessor Smith, Herr Doktor Smith 
and Mr. Smith, Esq. Mister and 
professor Cordwainer Smith, a 
world traveler, confides that he was 
a great disappointment to his fam- 
ily because at the age of nine he 
could speak only five languages. 
Herr Doktor George O. Smith does 
all his writing now in Potsdam, 
Germany, where he is an electronics 
engineer on one of those enormous 
world-girdling projects that keep our 
satellites in orbit and our messages 
going through. Also from Potsdam 
— but the other Potsdam, the one 
in upstate New York — is Mr. Jack 
Smith, Esq. Proving it’s a small 
world, he worked there for radio 
station WPDT, which, as it happens, 
is operated by our old friend David 
A. Kyle. Mr. Smith, Esq., is our 
“first” for this issue; the others, of 
course are long-time favorites.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes toaay.

Jules and Yvette 

F or twenty-eight minutes The Fly- 
ing d’Alemberts — who 
throughout two centuries had been 
the greatest troupe of aerialists of 
the entire Empire of Earth — had 
kept the vast audience of the Circus 
of the Galaxy spellbound: densely 
silent; almost tranced. For twenty- 



6 




TNI MWEILAi STARS 



eight minutes both side rings had 
been empty and dark. The air over 
the center ring, from the hard-pack- 
ed, imitation-sawdust-covered earth 
floor up to the plastic top one hun- 
dred forty-five feet above that floor, 
had been full of flying white-clad 
forms — singles and pairs and groups 
all doing something utterly breath- 
taking. 

Suddenly, in perfect unison, 
eighteen of the twenty d’Alemberts 
then performing swung to their 
perches, secured their apparatus, 
and stood motionless, each with his 
or her right arm pointing upward 
at the highest part of the Big Top. 

As all those arms pointed up at 
her, Yvette d’Alembert moved swift- 
ly, smoothly, out to the middle of 
her high wire — and that wire was 
high indeed, being one hundred thir- 
ty-two feet above the floor of the 
ring. She did not carry even a fan 
for balance. She maintained her 
equilibrium by almost imperceptible 
movements of her hands, feet, and 
body. Reaching the center of the 
span, she stopped and posed. To the 
audience she appeared as motion- 
less as a statue. 

Like all the other d’Alemberts, 
she was dressed in silver-spangled 
tights that clung to every part of 
her body like a second skin. Thus, 
while she was too short and too wide 
and too thick to be acceptable as 
an Earthly high-fashion model, her 
flamboyantly female figure made a 
very striking and very attractive 
picture — at a distance. Close up, 
however, that picture changed. 

Her ankles were much larger than 
any Earthwoman’s should have been. 

8 



Her wrists were those of a six-foot- 
four, two-hundred-fifty-pound tim- 
berman. Her musculature, from toe- 
nails to ears to fingertips, would 
have made all the beach-boys of 
Southern California turn green with 
envy. 

After a few seconds of posing, 
she turned her head and looked 
down at her brother Jules, on a 
perch sixty-one feet below her and 
an “impossible” sixty-four feet off 
to one side. Then, flexing her knees 
and swinging her horizontally out- 
stretched arms in ever-increasing 
arcs, she put more and more power 
into her tightly stretched steel — 
and Jules, grasping a flying ring 
in his left hand, began to flex his 
knees and move his body in pre- 
cise synchronization with the na- 
tural period of the girl-wire system 
so far above him. Finally, in the 
last cycle through which she could 
hold the wire, Yvette squatted and 
drove both powerful legs downward 
and to her right — and something 
snapped, with a harsh, metallic re- 
port as loud as a pistol shot 

T he wire, all its terrific tension 
released instantly as one end 
broke free and dropped, coiled itself 
up in the air with metallic whinings 
and slitherings; and Yvette d’Alem- 
bert, premiere aerialiste of all civi- 
lization, sprawling helplessly in mid- 
air, began her long fall to the floor. 

Eighteen d’Alemberts came to life 
on their perches, seized all the 
equipment they could reach, and 
hurled it all at the falling girl. One 
of her frantically reaching fingertips 
barely touched the bar of one swing- 



IP 




mg trapeze; none of the other appa- 
ratus came even close. 

Jules, in the lowest position, had 
more time than did any of the 
others; but he did not have a milli- 
second to spare. In the instant of 
the break he went outward and 
downward along the arc of the nine- 
ty-eight-foot radius of his top-hung 
flying ring. His aim was true and 
the force of launching had been 
precisely right. 

Yvette was falling face down, flat 
and horizontal, at a speed of over 
seventy feet a second as she neared 
the point of meeting. Jules, rigidly 
vertical at the bottom of his prodi- 
gious swing, was moving almost 
half that fast. In the instant before 
a right-angle collision that would 
have smashed any two ordinary 
athletes into masses of bloody flesh, 
two strong right hands smacked to- 
gether in the practically unbreakable 
hand-over-wrist grip of the aerialist 
and Yvette spun and twisted like 
a cat — except much faster. Both 
her feet went flat against his hard, 
flat belly. Her hard-sprung knees 
and powerful leg muscles absorbed 
most of the momentum of his mass 
and speed. Then, at the last possible 
instant, her legs went around his 
waist and locked behind his back, 
and his right hand flashed up to 
join his left in gripping the ring. 

That took care of the horizontal 
component of energy, but the verti- 
cal one was worse — much worse; 
almost twice as great. Its violence 
drove their locked bodies downward 
and into a small but vicious arc; a 
savagely wrenching violence that 
would have broken any ordinary 



man’s back in a fraction of a sec- 
ond. But Jules d’Alembert, although 
only five feet eight in height, had 
a mass of two hundred twenty-five 
pounds, most of which was compos- 
ed of super-hard, super-reactive 
muscle; unstretchable, unbreakable 
gristle; and super-dense, super- 
strong, horse-sized bone. His arms 
were as large as, and immensely 
stronger than, an ordinary Earth- 
man’s legs. 

The two bodies, unstressed now 
relative to each other, began to 
hurtle downward together, at an 
angle of thirty degrees from the 
vertical, toward the edge of the 
ring facing the reserved-seat and 
box section of the stands. 

T he weakest point in the whole 
stressed system was now Jules’ 
grip on that leather-covered steel 
ring. Could he hold it? Could he 
possibly hold it? Not one person in 
all that immense audience moved a 
muscle: not one of them even 
breathed. 

He held his grip for just under 
half a second, held it while that 
half-inch nylon cable stretched a 
good seven feet, held it while the en- 
tire supporting framework creaked 
and groaned. Then the merest mo- 
ment before that frightful fall would 
have been arrested and both would 
have been safe, Jules’ hands slipped 
from the ring and both began to fall 
the remaining forty feet to the 
ground. 

A high-speed camera, however, 
would have revealed the fact that 
they did not fall out of control. 
Each landed in perfect position. 



THE IMPERIAL STARS 



f 




Hard-sprung knees took half of the 
shock of landing; hard-sprung el- 
bows took half of what was left 
Heads bent low on chests; powerful 
leg muscles drove forward; thick, 
hard shoulders and back muscles 
struck the floor in perfect rolls; and 
both brother and sister somersault- 
ed lightly to their feet. 

Hand in hand, they posed motion- 
less for a moment; then bowed 
deeply in unison, turned and ran 
lightly to an exit — and they cover- 
ed that one hundred yards of dis- 
tance in less than five seconds. 

And the multitude of spectators 
went wild. 

They had seen a girl falling to 
certain death. They had felt a mo- 
mentary flash of relief — or actually 
of disappointment? — when it seem- 
ed as though her life might be 
saved. Then they had watched two 
magnificently alive young people 
fall, if not to certain death, at least 
to maiming, crippling injury. Then, 
in the climactic last split second, the 
whole terrible accident had become 
the grand finale of the act. 

That it was a grand finale — a 
crashing smash of a finish — there 
was no possible doubt. The only 
question was, what emotion predo- 
minated in that shrieking, yelling, 
clapping, jeering, cheering, whistling 
and catcalling throng of Earthpeople 
— relief, appreciation or disappoint- 
ment? 

Whatever it was, however, they 
had all had the thrill of a life-time; 
and few if any of them could under- 
stand how it could possibly have 
been done. 

For of the teeming billions of 

10 



people inhabiting the nine hundred 
forty-two other planets of the Em- 
pire of Earth, scarcely one in a 
million had ever even heard of the 
planet DesPlaines. Of those who had 
heard of it, comparatively few knew 
that its surface gravity was approxi- 
mately three thousand centimeters 
per second squared — more than 
three times that of small, green 
Earth. And most of those who knew 
that fact neither knew nor cared 
that harsh, forbidding, hostile Des- 
Plaines was the home world of the 
Circus of the Galaxy and of The 
Family d’Alembert 

n 

The Service of the Empire (SO- 
TE) was founded in 2239 by Em- 
press Stanley 3, the first of the Great 
Stanleys, who, during her reign of 
37 years (2237-2274) inculcated in 
it the spirit of loyalty and devotion 
that has characterized it ever since. 
Its spirit wavered only once, under 
weak and vicious Empress Stanley 
5, whose reign — fortunately very 
short (2293-2299) — was calami- 
tous in every respect. SOTE came 
to full power, however, only under 
Emperor Stanley 10 ( reign 2379- 
— ), the third and greatest of the 
Great Stanleys, under whom it be- 
came the finest organization of its 
kind ever known. (Baird, A Study 
of Security, Ed. 2447, p291). 

The Brawl in the Dunedin Arms 

T he city of Tampeta, Florida, had 
a population of over fifteen 
milli on. It included, not only what 

IP 




had once been Tampa, St. Peters- 
burg and Clearwater, but also all 
the other cities and villages between 
Sarasota on the south and Port 
Richey on the north. Just outside 
Tampeta’s city limit, well out to- 
ward Lakeland, lay the Pinellas Fair 
Ground. There the Circus of the 
Galaxy had been playing to capa- 
city crowds for over a week, with 
a different show — especially with 
an entirely different climax — every 
night. 

Jules and Yvette d’Alembert, as 
top stars of the show, of course 
had private dressing rooms. They 
also had private entrances. Thus no 
one connected with the show saw, 
and no one else either noticed or 
cared, that two short, fat Delfians, 
muffled to the eyes in the shapeless- 
ly billowing robes and hoods of their 
race, joined one of the columns of 
people moving slowly toward the 
exits leading to the immense parking 
lot. It took them half an hour to 
get to their car, but they were in 
no hurry. 

Out of the traffic jam at last, 
Jules maneuvered his heavy vehicle 
up into the second-level, west-bound 
Interstate Four and sped for the 
Dunedin district and the Dunedin 
Arms, one of the plushiest night 
spots in all North America. At the 
Arms, he gave a dollar to the park- 
ing-lot attendant, another to the 
resplendently - uniformed doorman 
and a third to the usher who es- 
corted them ceremoniously into the 
elevator and up to the fourth floor. 
At the check-stand the two Delfians 
refused — as expected — to part 
with any of their mufflings. Jules 

THE IMPERIAL STARS 



did, however — also as expected — 
give the provocatively clad hat-check 
girl a dollar before he handed his 
reservation slip and a five-dollar bill 
to the bowing captain. 

“Thank you, sir and madam,* 
that worthy said. “We are very 
glad indeed to have you with us 
this evening, Mister and Misses Tyg- 
ven. Will you have your table now, 
or perhaps a little later?* 

“A little later, I think,” Jules 
said, using faultlessly the Russo- 
English “Empirese” that was the 
court language of the Empire. He 
paused then, and gazed about the 
huge room. At his right, along the 
full two-hundred-foot length of the 
room, ran the subduedly ornate, mir- 
ror-backed bar. At his left were 
three tremendous windows over- 
looking the beach and the open Gulf. 
Heavy tables of genuine oak, not too 
closely spaced, filled the place ex- 
cept for a large central dance floor. 
On a stage at the far end of the 
room a spot-lighted, red-haired strip- 
per was doing her stuff. Priceless 
paintings and fabulous tapestries 
adorned the walls. Suits of armor 
dating from the ancient days of 
chivalry stood on pedestals and 
niches here and there. The place 
was jammed with a gay, colorful 
and festive crowd; there were only 
a few vacant places even at that 
tremendously long bar. 

It was quite evident why the cap- 
tain had suggested a short delay, 
so Jules said, “Yes, later, please. 
We will do a little serious drinking 
at the bar before we eat.” 

And at the bar, Jules laid a fifty- 
dollar bill on the oak and said, “A 



11 




liter of vodnak, please. Estvan’s, if 
you have it. In the original bottle — 
sealed.” 

“We have it. Mister.” The bar- 
tender set out two glasses, a bowl 
of ice and the heavy, crudely mold- 
ed, green-glass bottle of the one- 
hundred-and-twenty-proof beverage 
that was the favored tipple of the 
rim-world, Delf. “We’ve got every- 
thing. And don’t worry about it not 
being the clear quill. We don’t 
cheat With our prices we don’t 
have to” — and he put down on 
the bar a dollar and fifteen cents 
in change, which Jules waved away. 

Before Jules opened the bottle — 
he was looking into the mirror, and 
so was Yvette — the man at Yvette’s 
left finished his drink and moved 
away, and a tall, slim Earthman 
came up to take his place. Holding 
up one finger to the bartender, the 
newcomer said, “I’ll take a jigger 
of the . 

T hat was as far as he got. “Rube!” 
Yvette snapped — throughout 
the years, half of the old-time circus 
battle-cry of “Hey Rube!” had sur- 
vived. She grabbed the heavy bottle 
by its neck, and hurling it even as 
she dropped — dropped safely un- 
der the vicious blaster-beam that, 
having incinerated the slender Earth- 
man, swept through the space her 
chest had occupied an instant be- 
fore. Still in air, falling almost flat, 
she braced one foot against the bar, 
dived headlong under the nearest 
table, bent her back and heaved. 

The blaster-beam, however, had 
already expired. The heavy bottle, 
still full and still sealed, hurled with 



a DesPlainian’s strength and with 
an aerialist’s sure control, had 
struck bottom-on squarely in the 
middle of the gunner’s face — and 
that gunner now had no face at 
all and scarcely enough head to 
be recognizable as human. 

Jules, too, was busy. He too had 
dropped at his sister’s warning word, 
scanning the room as he fell. He 
too made a dive; but his was high 
and far, toward a table for six at 
which only two couples sat. One 
of the men at that table, half hidden 
behind a tall and statuesque blonde, 
had started to rise to his feet and 
was reaching for his left armpit. 

Jules lit flat on the table and 
slid angle-wise across its length, in 
a welter of breaking and flying 
dishes, glassware, silverware, food 
and drink, directly at the man trying 
so frantically to draw his weapon. 
En route, Jules brushed the blonde 
aside. He didn’t push her hard at 
all — just a one-handed gentle 
shove; just enough to get her out 
of the way. Nevertheless, she went 
over backward, chair and all, and 
performed an involuntary back 
somersault — thus revealing to all 
interested observers that she wore 
only a lacy trifle of nylon in the 
way of underwear. 

Continuing his slide, Jules made 
a point of his left elbow and ram- 
med it into the man’s gut. Then, 
as the man doubled up and “w-h-o- 
o-s-h-e-d” in agony, Jules whirled 
to his feet off of the table and 
chopped the hard edge of his right 
hand down onto the back of his 
victim’s neck — which broke with 
a snap audible for dozens of feet 

IF 



12 




above the uproar then going on. 
Then, seizing the man’s half-drawn 
weapon — it was a stun-gun, not 
a blaster — he glanced at its dial. 
Ten. Wide open. Instantly lethal. 
Clicking it back to three — a half- 
hour stun — he played its beam 
briefly over the other man at the 
table (the guy had been too quiet 
and too unconcerned by far during 
all this action) and whirled around 
to see how his sister was making 
out. 

Yvette was doing all right. The 
table under which she had disap- 
peared had leaped into the air, turn- 
ed over — shedding dishes and so 
forth far and wide — and crashed 
**t>wn onto the table at which the 
first blasterman and three other 
goons had been sitting. She had 
picked the blaster up and had tried 
to bend it around the side of Num- 
ber Two’s head; but it broke up 
almost as thoroughly as the head 
did. Ducking as only such a per- 
former as she was could duck, she 
grabbed Number Three by the an- 
kles, up-ended him, kicked the flam- 
ing blaster out of his hand before 
it could kill more than three in- 
nocent bystanders and was going to 
use him as a flail on Number Four 
when that unlucky (or lucky) wight 
slumped bonelessly to the floor in 
the beam of her brother’s stunner. 

She had the motion all made — 
why waste it? — So, continuing her 
swing, she hammer-threw Number 
Three over a few rows of tables and 
out into fifty feet of air through 
the middle of one of the three im- 
mense windows already mentioned. 

Have you ever heard four hun- 

THE IMPERIAL STARS 



dred and thirty-two square feet of 
three-eighths-inch-thick plate glass 
shatter all at once? It makes a 
noise. 

Such a noise that all lesser noises 
stopped instantly. 

And in that strained, tense silence 
Jules spoke quietly to his sister. Both 
were apparently perfectly calm. Nei- 
ther breathed one count faster than 
normal. Only their eyes — his a 
glacially cold gray; hers a furiously 
hot blue — showed how angry and 
how disconcerted they both were. 
“Many more of ’em, you think?” 
he asked. 

“Not to spot.” Yvette shook her 
head. “And we’ve got no time to 
check.” 

“Right. Take that one, I’ll bring 
the other. Flit.” Carrying two un- 
conscious men, the two ran lightly, 
but at terrific speed, down three 
flights of stairs and out into the 
parking lot. The attendant, upon see- 
ing what burdens they carried, tried 
simultaneously to run and to yell, 
but accomplished neither — a half- 
hour stun saw to that. 

Tortured rubber shrieked and 
smoked as the heavy car spun out 
of the lot and into the highway 
Fortunately, traffic was so light — 
it was then half past two in the 
morning — that Jules did not have 
to drive far before a moment came 
when no other car was in sight. 

The d’Alembert vehicle, while it 
looked pretty much like an ordi- 
nary groundcar, was a little too 
long and too wide and too round 
and much too heavy to be any 
standard model. Thus, alone in the 
road for a moment, Jules punched 

IS 




three buttons and three things hap- 
pened: 1) the car’s lights went out; 

2) from those too-round sides the 
two halves of an airtight, bullet- 
proof, transparent canopy shot up, 
snapped together, and locked; and 

3) the vehicle went straight up, at 
an acceleration of four Earthly gra- 
vities — having two Earthers aboard 
they couldn’t hurry — to an altitude 
of a hundred and ninety thousand 
feet before it stopped. 

J ules and Yvette removed what 
was left of their Delfian cos- 
tumes — which wasn’t very much 
— and stared wordlessly into each 
other’s eyes for a long half minute. 
Then Yvette spoke: 

“That was our contact. Our only 
contact. And we don’t know any- 
body in SOTE on Earth . and 
there was a leak. There had to be a 
leak, Julie.” 

“That's for sure, and it was no 
ordinary leak, either. It had to be 
right in the Head’s own office . 
Jules voice died away. 

Yvette shivered. “I’m afraid so. 
And we haven’t an inkling, except 
for his retinal pattern, of who the 
Head is or where he is. He may not 
be on Earth, even.” 

“Well, there’ll be somebody in 
the Tampeta office here and they’ll 
be on the alert. That brawl put 
the stuff into the fan but good. 
They'll be monitoring the channel 
every second." 

“But our friends’ friends down 
there will be monitoring all channels 
every second — and they probably 
have the codes.” 

He thought for a moment, then 



grinned. “So I’ll go back to one 
that’s so old and so simple that 
they probably never heard of it . 
unless it’d fool our monitor, too . 
uh-uh. Whoever they’ve got on moni- 
tor right now is no dumb bunny; 
so here goes.” 

He flipped a blue switch and 
raised his powerful — and not too 
unmusical — deep bass voice in 
song: “Sing of the evening star, 
Oh Susan; sweetest old tune ever 
sung. Oh, Susan, sweet one, *tis . .” 
“Susan here.” A lilting, smooth- 
as-cream contralto voice came from 
the speaker. There was a moment 
of silence, then the voice said “Cut!” 
and Jules flipped his switch; where- 
upon the voice concluded, “We’ll 
beep you in. Out.” 

“I’ll say they’re alert!” Yvette 
exclaimed; then went on, half-giggl- 
ing in relief. “And she’s fast on the 
trigger — ‘Susan here’ my left eye- 
ball. You made that whole thing up, 
didn’t you, on the spur of the mo- 
ment.” 

“Uh-huh. If I’d had a little time 
the verse would have been as good 
as the music.” 

Yvette snorted. “Ha! Modesty, 
thy name is Jules! I expect them to 
tap you for the Met any minute 
now. But you were right on one 
thing — no dumb bunny could 
make ‘S-O-T-E- — S-O-S’ so fast 
out of that mess of yowling. But it 
won’t really be a beeper, you think?” 
“Anything else but. My guess is 
a laser. They’ve got us lined up and 
they’ll pour it right into our cup — 
so I’d better set the cup to spinning.” 
He did so, and in less than a 
minute the pencil-thin beam came 

IF

In, chopped up Into evenly-spaced 
dashes by the rotation of the cup- 
antenna of the car. There was of 
course no voice or signal. 

While Jules was manipulating his 
finders to determine the exact line 
of the beam, he said, “ Better un- 
limber the launchers, Evie, and 
break out some bombs. Just in case 
somebody wants to argue with us on 
die way. I’ll handle the other stuff.” 

“That’s a thought — ” She broke 
off; her tone changed, “But just 
suppose that’s their beam?” 

“Could be; so we’ll have to look 
a little bit out when we land. But 
they know that. So if everything’s 
oke they’ll engineer a safe approach 
— we won’t have to. They know 
who we are.” Things had gone 
wrong. They had given the right 
signal at the rendezvous — but the 
wrong people had responded. Now 
they had to find out whyl

Democracy failed because it could 
not cope with Communism . This 
failure , which began early in the 
twentieth century , became very ev- 
ident when , in 1922, Canada, the 
United States of America and Mexi- 
co united to form the United States 
of North America. The Congress 
of the USNA agrued and filibuster- 
ed, but could not agree upon any 
effective action against Commit- 
ism. The Premier of Russia, how- 
ever, acted. He issued orders; the 
recipients of which either obeyed 
them promptly or were promptly 
shot. ( Mees , History of Civilization , 
Vol. 21, pl077) 

THE IMPERIAL STARS 



The Head 

S liding down the beam, the d’Al- 
embert’s vehicle was heading 
directly toward the roof of a build- 
ing that towered at least forty stories 
above any other structure in its 
neighborhood. 

Jules slowed down; approached 
it gingerly; stopped half a mile 
away. It was all dark, except, stran- 
gely enough, for a small, brightly- 
lighted spot on the roof of one 
wing. 

“Scan it,” Jules said. “Infra first. 
See what it is.” 

Yvette put her eye to the scan- 
ner. “Hall of State; Sector Four. 
That makes sense. State would be 
the best place to hide the Service, 
wouldn’t it?” 

“Check. And the spot?” 
“Floodlight. One. That’s a girl, 
standing in it. Young. Skinny, but 
not bad for an Earther. Black hair 
— throat-mike — sweater — shorts 
— two Mark Twenty-Nine Service 
blasters hanging loose — sandals. 
Sneak up, Julie.” 

Jules dropped the “car” — which 
was in fact one of the deadliest 
fighting machines of its weight ever 
built by man — down to within 
a couple of hundred yards of the 
lighted spot and stopped; and that 
highly distinctive throaty contralto 
voice came again from the speaker. 

“It’s safe to talk now if we don't 
say too much,” the voice said con- 
versationally. “Are you armed?” 
“Yes.” Jules wasn’t saying much, 
yet. 

“Good. You won’t need these, 
then.” The girl walked out of the 



15 




ring of light, put the brutal big 
hand-weapons down on the roof, and 
resumed her former place. “You 
recognize my voice, of course.” 

“Yes.” 

“You have a retinascope, I sup- 
pose.” 

“Yes. Hold it a minute.” 

Jules cut com and turned to his 
sister. “I don’t like this a nickel’s 
worth. What Earther’s pattern, ex- 
cept the Head’s, would we recog- 
nize without a comparison disk? No- 
body’s. So, if this is on the up and 
up, we’ve got to manhandle the 
Head himself.” 

Yvette bit her lip. “Well, you 
said they’d arrange a safe approach, 
and that certainly would be one. 
What else can we do?” 

“Nothing,” and Jules again flip- 
ped the blue switch. “Go ahead.” 

“Land anywhere you please and 
one person will come aboard. Un- 
armed.” 

“Oke.” Jules landed the car well 
away from the ring of light and 
opened a port. 

In the darkness all that could be 
seen of the man who came up, 
empty hands outstretched, was that 
he was of medium height, of me- 
dium build and almost completely 
bald. He put his hands in through 
the port and Yvette, taking one of 
his wrists in each hand, helped him 
through the narrow opening and 
into the cramped front compartment 
of the car, where she held him gent- 
ly but securely while Jules applied 
the retinascope to the Earthman’s 
right eye. 

“The head himself,” Jules said. 
“I’m sorry, sir ... ” 



“Think nothing of H, Jules.” The 
stranger laughed deeply. “If you had 
acted differently I would have been 
amazed, displeased and disappointed. 
As it is, I am very glad indeed to 
meet you in the flesh,” and he 
shook hands vigorously. “And you 
too, Yvette, my dear.” Taking her 
hand, he kissed it in as courtly a 
fashion as though that tiny, cramped 
compartment were a ballroom. “And 
now — purely a formality, of course 
— the eyes. Yvette first, please,” 
and he handed her the 'scope. 

She fitted it to her eye. “But 
you didn’t put any disk in,” she said. 
“Surely, sir, you don’t ...” 

CCT surely do.” He studied her 

A pattern briefly, then Jules’. “I 
don’t know very many patterns, of 
course; but Jules and Yvette d’Al- 
embert? You’re too modest altogeth- 
er, my dear.” Then, opening the 
port, he called out, “Still safe, Hel- 
ena?” 

“Still safe, father,” the girl called 
back, and began to walk toward 
the car. “Nothing suspicious, they 
say, within three hundred miles of 
here.” 

“Fine,” Jules said. He opened 
the car up and all three got out. 
Jules went on, “I was hoping we 
were fast enough to get away clean, 
but I couldn’t be sure. Now, sir, 
about our guests,” and he jerked 
a thumb toward the rear compart- 
ment where the prisoners soddenly 
slept. 

“Ah, yes. I’ve been wondering 
about them. The reports were con- 
fused and contradictory.” 

“I’m not surprised; it happened 

IF 



16 




fast That one — ” Jules pointed — 
“is probably just a low-bred gunnie 
that doesn’t know a thing. The other 
one may not know anything or he 
may know a lot,” and he told, in 
a very few words, about the too 
imperturbable observer of the brawl. 
He finished: “So our secret ren- 
dezvous was no secret.” 

“I see.” The Head raised his 
left wrist to his lips and said, “Colo- 
nel Grandon.” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“Be on the roof in exactly two 
minutes. You’ll find two men who 
got number three stunbeams about 
twenty minutes ago. They’re in a 
Mark Forty-One Service Special near 
Space Jay Twelve. Revive them, 
find what they know and report.” 
“Very well, sir,” and the Head 
led the way to an elevator. 

The elevator took them down to 
the thirty-first floor, where it stop- 
ped of itself and opened its door 
into what was very evidently the 
private office of an exceedingly 
important man. 

It was a fairly large room, fur- 
nished richly but quietly. The rug, 
brown in color, was thick and soft. 
The beamed ceiling was of beauti- 
fully grained brown solentawood; 
the paneled walls were of the same 
fine, almost metal-hard wood. On 
the wall behind the big solentawood 
desk was inlaid the gold-crowned 
Shield of Empire. 

“Now we can talk,” the girl said 
then, holding out her hand to Jules. 
“I’m Grand Lady ... Oh, excuse 
that please!” She flushed hotly, 
whereupon Jules kissed her hand 
in true Court style; after which she 



shook hands cordially with both 
Jules and Yvette. 

“She should blush, friends,” the 
Head said, but with no reproof in 
his voice. “But she hasn’t been in 
the Service very long.” Turning to 
the girl, he went on. “You are the 
Head’s Girl Friday here, my dear. 
Our guests are of the thinnest upper 
crust of the entire Service; their 
worth to the Crown is immeasurable 
— beyond any number of Grand 
Ladies. We’ll sit down, please, and 
Helena will pour. A whiskey sour 
for me, if you please.” He cocked 
an eyebrow at his two agents. 
“Yours?” 

“Orange juice, please,” Yvette 
said, promptly; and Jules said, “Le- 
monade, please, if you have it han- 
dy.” 

D rinks in hand — Grand Lady 
Helena was drinking a weird- 
looking ice-cream concoction — the 
Head said: 

“The attack on you was a com- 
plete surprise. No leak, no hanky- 
panky was even suspected until the 
man who was to bring you to me 
here was killed. The connection be- 
tween this business and the matter 
that brought you to Earth is clear. 
In that connection it is a highly 
pleasing thought that the opposition 
knows nothing of you or of the 
Circus. You agree?” 

“I agree, sir,” Jules said, and 
Yvette nodded. 

But Helena was puzzled. “How 
can it follow that they don’t know, 
father?” 

“The d’Alemberts are new to you 
because there is no record anywhere 

IF 



THE IMPERIAL STARS 




of any connection between them 
and us. Except for this surprise at- 
tack you would not be learning of 
them now. I will go into detail after 
they leave, but for the present I 
will simply state as a fact that no 
one who knows anything about them 
would send only six men against 
Jules and Yvette d’Alembert. Or, 
if only six, all six would have fired 
simultaneously and on sight at them 
instead of burning the contact man 
first. That shows that they were 
more afraid of the Service here 
than of the supposed Delfian agents 
— a fatal error.” 

“Oh, I see — excuse me, please, 
for interrupting.” 

“That’s quite all right. It’s part 
of your education, Girl Friday. To 
proceed: we are investigating. We 
will find out where the leak is here 
and clean up the mess. In the mean- 
time we will go ahead with the 
business for which we scheduled the 
Circus of Earth. There’s trouble: 
centering, probably, on Durward. 
I’ll give you all forty-odd reels of 
the record on it, but there are many 
things that are not on record and 
never will be, which is why I had 
to discuss it with you in person. 
You’ll also have to talk to some 
outsiders to get the full picture. You 
may want to conduct preliminary 
investigation on Earth and/or else- 
where before you go anywhere near 
Durward.” 

The Head got up. These were 
his most valuable agents, and the 
fact that he had brought them here 
was a measure of the importance 
he attached to the situation. He had 
fully expected that there would be 
18 



trouble waiting for them between 
the Circus and his office . and 
he had been equally confident that 
the d’Alemberts would be able to 
handle it. 

What he was less sure of was that 
they — even they — would be 
able to handle the trouble that lay 
ahead. 

He said abruptly, “Let’s fill in 
some background. For example, con- 
sider the question of loyalty. The 
Service is loyal to the Crown as 
the symbol of Empire; to the wearer 
of the Crown, whoever or whatever 
he or she may be, as the focal 
point of the Empire. You agree?” 
“Of course, sir,” Jules said, and 
both girls nodded. 

“Very well. In early 2378, when 
Crown Prince Ansel was planning 
the murder of every other member 
of the Royal Family, if we could 
have caught him at it in time we 
would have burned him down, 
Crown Prince though he was.” 
“Why, I . suppose that . 
yes, sir,” Jules said, and Yvette 
added thoughtfully: 

“I never thought of it before in 
just that way, sir. But that’s the 
way it would have to be.” 

“Nevertheless, after those eleven 
murders were accomplished facts 
Ansel, as the sole surviving member 
of the House of Stanley, became 
Emporer Stanley Nine. Was there 
then any question of gunning him? 
No. We instantly became as loyal 
to him as we had been to his father 
Stanley Eight and now are to his 
son Stanley Ten.” 

“Of course, sir. But what . .” 
“Now comes some off-the-record 

IF 




material. Have you ever heard oi 
Banion the Bastard?” 

Jules thought for a moment. “I 
don’t think so, sir,” he said. 

' Yvette shook her head, but this 
time Helena nodded and said, “Oh- 
oh — a light beginneth to dawn.” 

“I didn’t think you two had,” 
the Head went on. “Not too many 
people now alive ever have.”

Even before Arnold invented the 
subether drive and made galactic ex- 
ploration possible, all Earth except 
the USNA was under Communism 
and North America was being in- 
filtrated and undermined. The real 
explosion of mankind into space , 
however, did not begin until 2013, 
when Copeland discovered the ur- 
anium-rich planet Urania Four ; thus 
assuring all mankind of cheap and 
virtually unlimited power. In 2016 
the American anti-Communists, dis- 
gusted and alarmed by the success 
of the “do-nothings” and “do-good- 
ers” in blocking all effective action , 
left Earth en masse for Newhope ; 
whereupon Communism took con- 
trol of all Earth without firing a 
shot or launching a missile . ( Mees , 
History of Civilization; Vol. 21, p- 
1281). 

Banion the Bastard 

■jl/Tarsh ailing his thoughts, the 
Head drank half of his whis- 
key sour slowly, then went on, 
“Stanley Nine’s weakness was wom- 
en; particularly young ones. Al- 
though he married late in 2378, 

THE IMPERIAL STARS 




It 




by the end of that year the Empress 
was merely a part of the furniture 
and the then Duke of Durward — 
one Henry, a bachelor of thirty — 
saw his big chance. He combed his 
planet to find one highly special 
woman. She had to be young, a 
virgin, spectacularly beautiful, and 
highly intelligent. Also, as unscru- 
pulous, as vicious, and as hard as 
he himself was. Also unknown on 
Earth or at Court. He found her . 

The Head paused to finish his 
drink and build another one. 

“The Beast of Durward,” Helena 
said. “Surely you’ve heard of her ” 

Neither Jules nor Yvette had, and 
the Head went on, “A small-time, 
ruthlessly ambitious actress. The 
Duke arranged and financed for her 
a tremendous and tremendously ex- 
pensive splash at Grand Imperial 
Court, right here on Earth. Stanley 
Nine fell hard. He didn’t stand a 
chance — and, with the Duke’s 
full backing, she kept him on the 
hook much longer than any other 
woman was ever able to. 

“When she was about seven 
months pregnant the Duke married 
her; with Nine’s full approval. Thus 
her son Banion was born in wedlock 
as the first child of and the heir 
of the Duke and Duchess of Dur- 
ward. That, however, wasn’t enough 
for the schemers. Stanley Nine, still 
blindly infatuated with the extremely 
talented Beast, issued a Patent of 
Royalty, admitting paternity and be- 
stowing upon the infant the unique 
title of ‘The Prince of Durward’. 
This patent also authorized a coat 
of arms as follows: 

“ ‘Purpure, quarterly three drag- 



ons rampant or, in chief sinister 
a bend sinister or, in dexter . 

“Wait up, father!” Helena broke 
in. “You’re not getting through to 
me at all, and I don’t believe that’s 
our guests’ language, either.” 

The Head laughed. “Gold dragons, 
rearing on purple enamel. The bar 
sinister, which may not be a mark 
of illegitimacy, in this case definitely 
was. It goes on that way for a couple 
of hundred words, only a few of 
which are pertinent. ‘Bordure gules, 
charged thirteen bezants sable’. Poor 
heraldry — color on color and an 
unlucky number of spots on a back- 
ground of blood — but that and the 
fact that the Patent was dated Fri- 
day the Thirteenth of June, 2380, 
are perfectly in keeping with the 
Duke’s vicious sense of humor. 

“A couple of months later — 
long overdue — Nine finally got 
tired of the Beast and came to with 
a thud. He who had wiped out all 
the rest of the Royal Family had 
himself set up a pretender with a 
completely valid claim. He ordered 
the Service to kill the Duke and 
Banion and destroy the Patent; but 
he was ’way too late. The Beast 
had seen it coming and they got 
away clean. With the Patent. 

“The Patent, of course, was most 
important. It was hand-written and 
signed in carbon ink by Emperor 
Stanley Nine himself, on Imperial 
parchment, with the signature driv- 
en into the parchment by the Great 
Seal of the Empire of Earth. The 
Patent was revoked, of course, and 
erased from all record, and the 
people were proscribed; but that 
wasn’t enough. That Patent had to 

IF 



20 




be found and destroyed; but it 
wasn’t. Banion the Bastard had to be 
found and killed; but he wasn’t. 

“In 2381 there was a fairly serious 
uprising; which, it was deduced later, 
was engineered by the Beast on her 
own. At least, there was clear evi- 
dence that she tried to knife the 
Duke in bed and he cut her throat 
with her own blade. 

“The search for that Patent and 
the Bastard and his blood has been 
going on ever since 2380; twenty 
years before I was born. As I said, 
the record of it covers more than 
forty reels. Results were neglible — 
except for finding, at a cost of eigh- 
ty-nine lives, three very good for- 
geries — until two years ago, when 
several leads pointed back to Dur- 
ward again. We sent agents, who 
found nothing. Three months ago 
all those agents stopped reporting. 
I sent in four of our best — with 
orders, of course, to avoid all pre- 
vious contacts — and have not 
heard from any of them. Hence the 
Circus; the heaviest artillery the Ser- 
vice has. The threat to Stanley Ten 
and The Family is grave indeed. 
Just how grave I myself did not 
fully realize until the event of last 
night. 

“Duke Henry was born in 2350, 
ninety-seven years ago; so he is 
probably dead. So it may or may 
not be his children and/or grand- 
children who are carrying on. The 
Bastard, though, at 67, may still 
be a potent force; and he undoubt- 
edly has children and grandchildren 
whom we don’t know anything 
about, either. 

“Your job is composed of two 



equally important parts. One, to 
find the genuine Patent and to briog 
it in so we can check its authenticity 
and so Stanley Ten can destroy It 
with his own bands. Two, to kill 
Banion the Bastard and aH of hti 
blood. Goodbye and good luck.” 

B ack at the Circus, well after day- 
break, Jules and Yvette re- 
ported to their father, the Manag- 
ing Director. Then they drove out 
to the edge of the field, snugged 
their “oar” down into its berth in 
their ultra-fast two-man subspacer, 
and Jules said: 

“I knew the Head would have to 
be a Big Wheel, but not that big. 
If his daughter’s a Grand Lady he’s 
got to be a Grand Duke, no less. 

I think maybe I’ve seen his picture 
somewhere or seen him in a parade 
or something on tri-di ...” 

“Oh, brother /” Yvette snorted. 
“And I use the term advisedly. If 
you didn’t recognize Grand Duke 
Zander von Wilmenhorst on sight! 
Oh no, he isn’t much of anybody — 
just one-half Stanley blood and the 
fifth from the Throne itself, is all. 
You’d better break out your Peerage 
and start studying it.” 

“Uh-huh. What a cover for the 
Head — my God, he owns Sector 
Four!” 

They slept until half past two; 
then went into the main tent to 
watch the climax of the matinee. 
They watched, with trained and 
minutely observant eyes, Yvette and 
Jules d’Alembert perform flawlessly 
a heart-stopping variation of the 
act they themselves had performed 
the night before. 



THE IMPERIAL STARS

Five minutes later, the younger 
couple still in spangles, the four 
d’Alemberts sat at a table in the 
commissary. The two men looked 
very much alike; so did the two 
girls — which was not surprising, 
since the two couples were two pairs 
of twins born of the same parents 
three yean apart No one except 
a DesPlainian could have told the 
two men or the two girls apart ex- 
cept by direct comparison. To the 
personnel of the Circus of the Gal- 
axy this succession of top stars was 
routine. In the two-hundred-year 
history of the Circus there had been 
almost a hundred pairs called “Jules 
and Yvette d’Alembert”; there 
would continue to be a succession 
of them, one new pair every two 
or three years, as long as the Circus 
should endure. 

“How’d we do, Gran’paw?” the 
younger brother asked. “It must 
have been a treat to see a good 
performance of your act.” 

“Close the orifice, Jules,” the 
younger girl broke in. 

“Oh, you’re calling me Jules al- 
ready?” 

“Certainly. You are Jules now. 
What I started to say was, that’s 
the way people break their arms, 
patting themselves on the back so 
much.” 

“Oke. What I meant was, I’m glad 
the Head pulled them out of the 
Circus for special duty. It wouldn’t 
be too long before they’d spatter 
themselves all over the ring the 
way their joints are creaking now. 
How about that, Jules?” and Jules 
grinned at Jules. 

“That is very true and very sad. 



Jules,” Jules agreed, as a waitress 
came up to take their orders. “These 
ancient and unwieldy bones are just 
about ready for the fertilizer mill. 
The old-time pep is all shot . .” 
“Stop crying, Jules, poor dear,” 
the waitress said. She was, of course, 
a d’Alembert, too; and she had been 
a star. “Before I break down and 
dilute your soup with a flood of 
tears of my own. The King and 
Queen are dead, et cetera. So what? 
You’re just getting started on your 
real jobs. The usual?” 

“Not quite,” Yvette said. “You 
can get fresh orange juice here and 
I’m drowning myself in it. Squeeze 
me half a liter, please Felice dear, 
besides the usual.” 

“ ‘Drowning yourself is right,” 
the younger Yvette said, darkly. 
“I've got to watch my figure; so 
Fll have one small glass of lemon 
sour and a lamb chop.” 

After eating, the older Jules and 
Yvette left the Circus — without 
a ripple to show that they had gone.

Citizens of Earth 

J ules and Yvette studied, analyzed 
and restudied forty-seven spools 
of top-secret date, then sent them — 
top-secretly — through channels 
back to the Head. Then they visit- 
ed more or less openly almost every 
district of Earth. 

At every point they encountered 
the same not-right odor. Something 
was definitely wrong. Security had 
been breached — within the Service 
itself! 

To Jules and Yvette d’Alembert 
the situation shrieked for action — 
instant effective action, at that. If 
the Service caught a chill, a hundred 
outlying planets lay under the threat 
of double pneumonia. For the Ser- 
vice was the ganglionic nerve system 
of the Stanleys themselves . and 
every bright, burning star, every 
immensely long, black spacelane, 
every whirling world and pocket 
of cosmic dust trembled and shook 
when those nerves tingled. 

As the evidence grew it became 
clear that there were two courses 
of action. They could patiently, 
painstakingly search, sift and study 
. and hope for a break ... or 
they could plunge themselves into 
a trouble spot — offer themselves 
as bait — risk life and limb on a 
gamble, and trust to mind and 
muscle to get them out. These were 
the choices . 



But really, there was no choice — 
because they were the d’Alemberts. 

“Out of everything we’ve learned 
I can see only three points of attack 
outside of Durward itself,” Jules 
said, thoughtfully. “Algonia, Nevan- 
der, and Aston. Years apart. Three 
forged Patents of Royalty, fiighty- 
nine good agents down the drain 
. most of them probably as smart 
as we are ... in spite of all the 
help the local SOTE could give 
them ...” He paused. 

“Uh-huh. Go on. Or because of 
it.” 

“Check. The higher the SOTE the 
the solider the security. We think. 
But that thing in the Head’s office 
didn’t smell exactly like Coty’s 
L’Arigon.” 

“I’ll say it didn’t. Usually they 
commit suicide or get their throats 
cut, but he simply disappeared. Ab- 
solutely vanished.” 

“So we’ll roll our own, except 
maybe for tops. So the big question 
is, what’s our best cover?” 

“Well, we can't be Earthers, that’s 
for sure.” Yvette shrugged her 
shoulders and indicated his shape 
and her own. “Nor Delfians, to 
stand inspection. We’re obviously 
DesPlainians. No other high-gravity 
planets were ever colonized, were 
there? Except Purity, of course . 
I wonder.” 

Jules frowned in thought. “That’s 
a thought, sis; that splinter-group of 
crackpots on Purity. We can be 
Puritans.” 

Yvette nibbled her lip. “But would 
it work? They won’t have anything 
to do with anybody they don’t ab- 
solutely have to. Everybody’s too 

23 



THE IMPERIAL STARS 




rinful. They expect all the other 
planets, especially mother-planet 
DesPlaines, to be whiffed into in- 
candescent vapor any minute by 
the wrath of God. There are a lot 
of renegade Puritans, though. Sin- 
ners .” 

“That’s what I meant. We’ll play 
it that they kicked us off because 
we got to be too sinful. We liked 
to dance and play cards and drink 
soda pop — to say nothing of min- 
ing gold and platinum and diamonds 
and emeralds and bootlegging all 
our stuff to Earth. That’s the way 
we made all our money. Remem- 
ber?” 

Yvette laughed. “Just dimly. I 
must have been looking the other 
way at the time, but you can fill 
me in. They have kicked a lot of 
people off of Purity for doing just 
that — and for much smaller sins, 
as well. Go ahead; it listens good.” 

“Oke, but I don’t know exactly 
what ... get into compound low, 
brain, and start grinding . how 
about this? We’ll have the Head 
make us ex-Puritan Citizens of 
Earth. You know how toplofty and 
you-be-damned Earthers are, out on 
the planets.” 

“Uh-huh, and we'll be toploftier 
and you-be-damneder than anybody. 
I like.” 

“Right. Concealment by obvious- 
ness. Rut as you said, not too many 
people ever even heard of Purity, 
and with our builds — your build 
especially — but wait a minute, 
how about disguising mel Hair down 
to my shoulders; waved and Hquid- 
golded. Eyebrows shaved to a dif- 
ferent shape and golded. Handle-bar

mustache, waxed to points and gold- 
ed. A cockeyed hat with gold 
plumes two feet long. Cloth-of-gold 
sleeveless jersey and tight purple 
trunks. Arms and legs bare. A mil- 
lion dollars worth of jewelry — 
genuine — and a big, heavy swag- 
ger-stick that’s really a blaster on 
one end and a stunner on the other. 
Think anybody’d recognize me as 
a DesPlainian in that kind of a fancy 
rig?” 

“I’ll say they wouldn’t!”' Yvette 
laughed delightedly, “anywhere on 
DesPlaines they’d shoot you on 
sight. The idea being that everyone 
would look at you and not bother 
to even wonder whether I was ir 
DesPlainian or not.” 

“Uh-huh. Maybe it's a bit thin, 
but . .” 

“I’ve got news for you, Buster.” 
Yvette laughed again. “Not only 
it’s thin, but also if you think I’m 
going to play little brown hen to 
that gorgeous hunk of rooster 
you’re out of your mind. I’ll design 
me a costume that will knock 
everybody’s eyes right out of their 
sockets — one that no DesPlainian 
woman would be caught dead in 
at a cat-fight.” 

“Now you’re chirping, birdie!” 

“That’ll be fun! But it'll take 
months to grow your hair ... a 
wig? Uh-uh.” 

“Uh-uh is correct. Too chancy. 
But they’ve been working on this 
case for sixty-seven years, so a few 
extra weeks isn’t going to make 
any important difference. And we’ll 
have plenty to do in the meantime.” 

“That’s true. Oka — let’s fly at 
” 



IF 




T hus it came about, some time 
later, that the Executive Office 
of the Duke of Algonia was invaded 
by a couple whose likes had never 
before been seen on the planet Al- 
gonia — or, for that matter, on any 
other planet. Jules was just as spec- 
tacular as his specifications had 
called for; Yvette was even more 
so. She, too, wore purple and gold 
— what little there was of it — 
with the arrangement of colors the 
exact reverse of his. 

Her shoes — not silly pumps, 
but half-calf-high sure-grips studded 
with precious stones — were royal 
purple. Her tight shorts were of 
golden jersey; her tight, sleeveless 
upper garment was of exactly the 
same shade of purple as her shoes 
and hair. She wore a wide, heavily- 
jeweled belt of nylon-backed gold; 
a jeweled half-veil of fine gold 
mesh; and, to cap the climax, a 
towering gold-filigree headdress of 
diamonds, emeralds and rubies that 
had been appraised at and insured 
for one million three hundred ninety 
thousand dollars. 

Paying no attention to the startled 
stares of the waiting people and 
office personnel, they walked calm- 
ly to the head of the line at the 
receptionist’s desk. “We are citi- 
zens of Earth,” Jules explained, as 
he courteously but firmly edged 
himself into the narrow space be- 
tween a fat woman and the desk. 
He leaned over, picked up the amaz- 
ed receptionist’s hand and tucked 
a hundred-dollar bill into it. “Carlos 
and Carmen Velasquez, Citizens of 
Earth,” he said gently, and dropped 
two ID cards onto her desk. “This 



k where visitors to your fair planet 
register, is it not?” 

“Oh, no, sir — thank you, sir," 
the flustered girl said, as soon aa 
her eyes got back into place and 
she could again use her voice. 

“That’s downstairs, air. The SOTE, 

*, »» 
sir. 

“You will take care of it, my 
dear.” Jules dropped three more 
notes on the desk. “Bring the cards 
over to the Hotel Splendide, after 
you have attended to it. We’ll be 
there for a few days ... or a few 
weeks, perhaps. Thank you, my 
girl.” And the two walked out of 
the office as unconcernedly as they 
had walked in. 

At the Splendide; which was the 
plushiest caravansery the planet 
boasted, they soon became the fa- 
vorite guests. Not only because 
they had the penthouse suite; 4>ut 
also because neither of them knew, 
apparently, that there was any 
smaller unit of currency than a 
five-dollar Earth bill. 

Whatever else they did, however, 
they always walked at a good, stiff 
hiking gait for at least an hour 
after supper. For the first few 
nights they explored; but after that, 
having found a route they liked, 
they stuck to it. Every night there- 
after they drove out beyond the 
city limits, parked their car and took 
a six-mile hike along a fixed suc- 
cession of narrow, lonely back- 
country roads and bridle-paths; a 
route that had five places made to 
order for ambush — and a route 
that they had gone to much trouble 
to publicize. 

For six nights they swung along 

25 



THE IMPERIAL STARS 




at their five-miles-an-hour hiking 
gait in complete silence . • 

Complete silence? Yes. Their sure- 
grip shoes made not even a whisper 
of sound against the blacktop: no 
item of their apparel or equipment 
rattled or tinkled or squeaked or 
even rustled. Everything had been 
designed that way. They could hear, 
but they could not be beard. Any- 
one laying for them would have to 
see them — and they themselves 
had very acute hearing and aerial- 
ists’ eyesight. 

Swinging along a clear stretch of 
road, Yvette asked, “S’pose we goof- 
ed, Julie?” 

“Uh-uh. Pretty sure not. It’s just 
taking them time to get set. Senor 
and Senora Velasquez aren’t the 
type to just disappear; it’d raise too 
much of a stink. Also, besides the 
king-size fortunes we’re wearing, 
everybody knows that we’ve got 
enough money in the safe at the 
Splendide to start a bank and they’ll 
want that So the job will take a 
lot of planning. This three-quarters- 
naked stunt wasn’t designed to make 
it tough to impersonate us, but how 
would you go about finding two 
people to check out of the Splendide 
— and get that half a megabuck 
out of their safe — as us?” 

"Nicer” Yvette laughed. “I never 
though of it cutting both ways. 
They’ll simply have to get a Des 
Plainian gangster and his moll . 
but wouldn’t they have them ready?” 

"I don’t think so. You don’t find 
very many DesPlainians on light- 
grav planets except in grav-controfl- 
ed buildings. They no like — for 
which I don't blame them. Another 



month of this with no work at gray 
and you and I both will be as 
flabby as two tubs of boiled nood- 
les.” 

"So we hope it won’t be a month. 
Oke; we’ll give ’em a few more 
days.” 

Five more hikes were eventless. 

But on the sixth, at a place where 
the road would through a coppice 
of small trees and dense under- 
brush, their straining ears heard 
sounds and their keen eyes' saw 
movement 

F or concealment, the place was 
perfect, but in order to act 
the attackers had to move — - and 
low-echelon thugs are not very 
smart. Also, they had no idea what- 
ever how fast their proposed quarry 
could move. Jules’ hat and swagger 
stick and Yvette’s tiara and handbag 
hit the blacktop practically at once 
as the two took off in low, flat 
dives ; he to his side of the road, she 
to hers. 

Diving straight through a bush, 
Jules slapped the nearest man light- 
ly on the head — gently, so as not 
to break his neck — picked him up, 
and hurled him at another man, 
some twelve feet away, who was 
just getting to his feet. One jump — 
he slugged the third in the solar 
plexus and in the same instant 
kicked the fourth in the face — not 
with his toe, but with the whole 
big flat sole of his shoe. Four down 
and one to go. But this action had 
taken almost a second of time — 
plenty of time for Number Five 
to get organized. Maybe he was 
the boss, since he'd been smut 

IP

enough to station himself well off 
to one side. 

Number Two, who hadn’t been 
hurt much, began to regain con- 
sciouness and to thrash around. 
Jules snaked bellywise over to him, 
picked his stunner up, and tapped 
him on the jaw with its butt. Then 
Jules crawled noiselessly around un- 
til he found a place from which 
he could get a fairly clear view to- 
ward Number Five; who, although 
he did not seem to realize it, was 
making a lot of noise. The seeing 
wasn’t good — the moon, while 
high, was only at quarter — but 
jpt much light is necessary to use 
a stun-gun at close quarters. 

“ P-s-s-s-t /” the hood said, finally. 
“Ed! Hank! Spike! Did you get 
’em. What the hell goes on?” He 
put his head out from behind a tree 
. and what went on was a half- 
hour stun. 

“Eve?” Jules asked then, of 
empty air. “Five here.” 

“Same here,” she replied from 
across the road. “No sweat. Is there 
any clear space over there?” 

“Yes — we’ll lug ’em over here.” 
Yvette recovered her towering 
headdress and bag, then came across 
the road, dragging two limp forms 
by the collars of their leather jack- 
ets. In a few minutes ten unconscious 
or dead men — Jules was afraid 
that he had hit Number Three a 
little too hard — were laid out on 
their backs in a neat row. 

Jules picked up a stunner, then 
paused. “Uh-uh,” he said, “Better 
give ’em the talk-juice now, so 
they’ll be ready when we get ’em 
out of the house.” 



“That’d be better.” And Yvette 
took a hypodermic kit out of her 
bag and went to work. 

VI 

In two centuries the colonized 
planets numbered seven hundred , 
many of them having large popula- 
tions. Interstellar commerce increas- 
ed exponentially . Interstellar crime 
became rampant . The government 
of Earth , under a succession of 
strong and able kings , had been 
in fact an imperium for many years 
when , in 2225, King Stanley the 
Sixth of Earth crowned himself Em- 
peror Stanley One of the Empire 
of Earth. ( Stanhope , Elements of 
Empire , p539). 

Storming the Castle 

Tules and Yvette did not drive 
** their car — which was of course 
the biggest and most expensive one 
obtainable — back to the hotel. 
Instead, they loaded their victims 
into the limousine like cordwood 
and took them to the “house” they 
had rented long since — an estate 
so big and so far away from any- 
where that the nearest neighbors 
could not have heard a forty-milli- 
meter Bofors working at full auto- 
matic. 

They unloaded their freight, then 
listened to the nine surviving hood- 
lums tell, completely unable to lie 
or withhold knowledge, everything 
they knew about crime — and es- 
pecially its biggest chief. 

The gamble paid off. “Got it!” 
exulted Jules when they were done.

rHE IMPERIAL STARS 




“I knew our friends — whoever 
they are — wouldn't stay out of a 
heist with this kind of money in- 
volved. But who would have thought 
that it was the Baron of Osberg . 

“You for one, brother dear,” sup- 
plied Yvette. “And maybe me for 
another — at least we knew the boss 
traitor had to be somebody big — 
but tell me, are we going to sit here 
all night patting you on the back 
or are we going to do something?” 

Jules grinned and gave her a 
mock-salute. Then they gave each 
of the men a twelve-hour stun and 
went elsewhere. 

The castle of the Baron of Osberg 
was some seventy miles away. They 
parked the car a good mile down 
the road from it and, after selecting 
certain items of equipment, went the 
rest of the way on foot, being very 
careful not to be seen. Then, very 
cautiously and keeping continuously 
under cover, they made their way 
around what was actually a fortress. 

The two gates, front and rear, 
were built of two-inch-square bar 
steel, topped with charged barbed 
wire. Neither could be opened ex- 
cept by electronic impulses from 
inside the castle. The estate was 
surrounded by a reenforced concrete 
wall fifteen feet high, surmounted 
by interlaced . strands of charged 
barbed wire. 

The two grinned at each other 
and separated. Taking advantage of 
the high, thick hedges bordering the 
drive, they sneaked up to within six 
feet of the wall. Both squatted down. 
Eyes met eyes through the lower, 
leafless part of the hedges. Muscles 
tensed and, at Yvette’s nod both 



leaped at full strength upward and 
inward. Each cleared the topmost 
wire by a good three feet, stunners 
drawn, and at the top of their 
silent flight they fired rapidly and 
precisely, stunning every guard they 
could see. Then, running around 
the main building, each taking a 
side, they stunned everything that 
moved. Yvette ran for the garage; 
Jules ran to the castle’s back door. 
It was locked, of course! but a 
Talbot cutter burned the lock away 
in seconds. 

Jules did not know whether that 
door opened directly into the kitch- 
en or into a hall; but the fact that 
it did open into the back hall mai5£~ 
the job easy and simple. The door 
to the kitchen was not locked. The 
dozen or so people in it slumped 
bonelessly to the floor before any 
one of them realized that anything 
unusual was going on. Through the 
kitchen Jules went, through the 
butler’s pantry and the serving hall, 
and put an eye to a tiny crack be- 
tween thick velvet drapes. 

The “commons” room was im- 
mense. Its beamed ceiling and pan- 
eled walls were of waxed yellow- 
wood. It was furnished lavishly and 
decorated profusely with ancestral 
portraits. At the far end there was 
an antlered fireplace in which a six- 
foot log smoldered. 

Eleven men were in that room; 
some sitting, some standing; smok- 
ing or drinking or both; talking only 
occasionally and mostly in mono- 
syllables; glancing much too fre- 
quently at watches on their wrists. 
Jules brought his stunner to bear 
and all eleven collapsed limply into 

IP

their chairs or onto the floor. 

In a couple of minute Yvette came 
in. “Oke outside” she reported 
crisply. “Now the big frisk.” 

“That’s right.” 

They went over the castle from 
subcellar to garrets, and when they 
were through they knew that every- 
one else inside the wall was uncon- 
scious. Then, and only then. Jules 
went over to the communicator, 
cut its video and punched a number. 

“This is the Service of the Em- 
pire,” a perfectly-trained, beautiful- 
ly-modulated voice came from the 
speaker. “How may I serve you? 
If you will turn your vision on, 
please?” 

“Sote six,” Jules said. “Affold 
abacus zymase bezant. The head 
depends upon the stomach for sur- 
vival.” 

“Bub-but-but, sir . The change 
in the girl’s voice was shocking. She 
had never heard any two of those 
four six-letter code words spoken 
together, and coupled with the words 
“head” and “survival” they knock- 
ed her out of control for a moment; 
but she rallied quickly. “He’s home 
asleep, sir, but I’ll get him right 
away. One moment, please,” and 
Jules heard the strident clatter of 
an unusually loud squawk-box. 

“Lemme ’lone,” a sleepy voice 
protested. “G’way. Cut out the damn 
racket or . .” 

“Mr. Borton! Wake up!” the girl 
almost screamed. “ Please wake up! 
It’s a crash-pri red urgent!” 

“Oh.” That had done it. “Oke, 
Hazel; thanks.” 

“You are connected, sirs, and I’m 
out. Signal green, please, when you

are through. 9 * She would much rath- 
er take a beating than listen to any 
part of the conversation that was 
to follow, whether she could under- 
stand any of it or not. 

“Praxis,” Borton said. (Request 
for identification, symbol, or author- 
ity). 

“Fazzle and Fezzle.” (Their own 
identifying numbers — Agents 
Eighteen and Nineteen). 

“Holy . ." Borton began, but 
shut himself up. The very top skim- 
mings of the very top cream of the 
entire Service! “Oke.” 

“Rafter, angles, angels. Angled. 
Suffer. Harlot static invert, cosine 
design. Single-joyful, singer, status, 
stasis. Over.* 

“Afy — God! Oke, but you didn’t 
say where you are.” 

“I don’t know your code for 
local specifics, so . comprehend 
Old English ig-pay attin-lay?” 

“Ess-yay.” 

‘Tate-ess-ay aron-bay berg-oz- 
zay.” 

“Catch . 99 

“Front gate. Douse you glims 
short-long-short Over and out if 
oke." 

“Catch. Oke," Borton said. And 
its was oke — perfectly so. If Agents 
Eighteen and Nineteen told any 
planetary chief of SOTE to go jump 
in the lake he’d do it — and fast. 
“Here’s your green, Hazel. Thanks.” 

I n the time that elapsed before 
Borton’s arrival at the estate of 
Baron’s Osberg, Jules and Yvette 
questioned the eleven men. They 
didn’t get enough to give them a 
dear lead to the planet Aston and 
30 



a general idea of what the mob on 
Aston would have to be like. Then 
Borton arrived and they let him in. 

“You!" he exclaimed, looking 
from one spectacular agent to the 
other and back again. "Thafs a 
switch. You came in with bands 
blaring and pennons waving." 

“Check. They would be looking 
for pussy-footers." 

“Could be ... If I may ask, I 
suppose there’s a good reason why 
I wasn’t let in on any of this?" 

41 “Very good. Come in and you’ll 
see what it was." They led him back 
into the commons room and Jules 
waved an arm at the stupefied qten 
who, glazed eyes unseeing, , lolled^ 
slackly in chairs. 

“You used Nitrobarb," Borton 
said. “And on the Baron of Os- 
berg. Half of them will die. I see." 

“They’ll all die," Jules said grim- 
ly. -“Especially the Baron. Those 
who live through this will live a 
few days longer than the others. 
Is all. But you really don’t see, yet 
Keep on looking." 

Borton’s fast-panning gaze came 
to a burly, crew-cut man of thirty- 
odd and stopped. His face turned 
gray; he was too shocked and too 
surprised even to swear. 

“That’s Alf Rixton," he manag- 
ed finally. “My first assistant. He’s 
been with me over ten years! top 
clearance — lie-detector and hypno- 
sis — every year. He’s done splen- 
did work." 

“Yeah — for the other side," 
Jules said coldly. “The only ones 
he ever gave you were the ones 
they wanted to get rid of. Take 
over, Borton, it’s all yours. We’ll 

IF 




have to stick around for a while — 
it’d smell cheesy if we’d leave the 
planet too soon — but we don’t want 
to appear in this. Not a whisper. 
Nobody around here got a glimpse 
of us, but there are nine men — ” he 
told him about them — “who 
shouldn’t talk.” 

“They won’t. But listen! This mess 
here — I couldn’t possibly have 
done this alone!” 

“Of course not.” Jules grinned. 
“Your assistant there cooked the 
whole deal up and helped you 
swing it. He was a tiger on wheels. 
Too bad the honors are posthu- 
mous.” 

^ Borton nodded slowly. “Thanks. 
One of our very best, he died a 
hero’s death, defending gallantly 
and so forth — sob, sob — the 
louse. But this thing of me taking 
all the credit for an operation that 
...” He broke off and grinned 
wryly. “Oke.” 

“Uh-huh,” Jules agreed. Then he 
and Yvette said in unison, “Here’s 
to tomorrow, fellow and friend. 
May we all live to see it!” And they 
strode blithely out. One nest had 
been cleared out — it was time to 
move on to the next! 

Borton, motionless, stared at the 
closed door. He knew what those 
two were — Agent Eighteen and 
Nineteen — but that was all he 
knew or ever would know about 
them . But he had too much to 
do to waste much time wool-gather- 
ing. Shrugging his shoulders, he 
called his office and issued orders. 

Then he set up his recorder and 
began to ask questions of the hood- 
lums who were still alive.

THE STANLEY DOCTRINE. 
Empress Stanley 3 also reorganized, 
simplified and in a sense standardiz- 
ed the theretofore chaotic system 
of nobility. Her system , which has 
been changed very little throughout 
the years , is in essence as follows . 
Grand Dukes ride sectors of space, 
each containing many planets . Dukes 
rule single planets. Marquises ride 
continents or the equivalents there- 
of. Earls rule states or small na- 
tion. Counts rule counties. Barons 
rule cities or districts. Primogeniture 
is strict , with no distinction as to 
sex. Nobles may marry commoners 
or higher or lower nobles ; the lower- 
born of each pair being automati- 
cally raised to the full rank of the 
higher-born spouse. ( Stanhope , Ele- 
ments of Empire , p541) 

The Switch 

T he news broke early the follow- 
ing morning. It broke with a 
crash that was channeled to every 
planet of civilization. 

Carlos and Carmen Velasquez 
knew nothing of it until half past 
ten, when the eager waiter hurried 
in with the breakfast they had 
ordered a few minutes before. Ho 
was accompanied this time by his 
captain, who carried both morning 
papers in his hand. 

“Good morning, sir and madam,” 
that worthy said. “You have perhaps 
not heard the extraordinary news 
on your receiver?” 

“Uh-us.” Jules covered a yawn 
with his hand an shook his head.

“We’re hardly awake yet.” He was 
wearing only purple-and-gold pa- 
jamas; Yvette wore her fabulous 
headpiece and a purple-and-gold robe 
that, while opaque in a few places 
here and there, was practically tran- 
sparent everywhere else. “Something 
happen?” 

“Most assuredly! The most tre- 
mendous, the most sensational erf 
happenings, be assured!” He put 
the papers down on a side table and 
helped the waiter arrange the break- 
fast table most meticulously. “But 
you will read of it later. You will 
eat your breakfast now, please, 
while it is hot.” And the two hotel 
men accepted gratuities and went 
back downstairs. 

After eating, Jules and Yvette 
went through the story with inter- 
est — if with an occasional snort 
or giggle. The official version was 
of course new to them. SOTE, un- 
der the masterly direction and lead- 
ership of Planetary Chief Borton, 
had been keeping this band of 
traitors under close and continuous 
surveillance for over a year. They 
had waited until they were sure 
that they had found every member 
and connection of the band, then 
they had struck everywhere at once. 
They had made a clean sweep. 

Faced with absolute proof of 
guilt, each traitor had confessed and 
each had been promptly executed, 
including the Baron of Osberg, who 
had been the leader. All had been 
cremated and their ashes had been 
dumped. The reporter was very 
glad to say that, since the Baron 
was the only member of his family 
involved in the crime, the Barony 



of Osberg would not revert to the 
crown. The Baroness Carlotta, who 
was very well known as a philan- 
thropic clubwoman would succeed 
— and so on. 

Planetary Chief Borton had had 
no help, not even from Earth. And 
there was no hint anywhere that 
nitrobarb — the mere possession 
of which was by law a capital 
offense — had been used. 

“Nice,” Yvette said. “That story 
is so tight I almost believe it my- 
self. But you said we’d have to 
stick around. Why? The fact that 
we were here on the planet — 
coupled with the fact that those two 
Delfians had to be DesPlainians ^ 
would be plenty for people not half 
as smart as they are. Whether we 
stay here a month or leave today 
makes no difference — except per- 
haps as an exercise in the old guess- 
ing game.” 

“That’s probably right, at that 
. Oke, we’ll shoot in a call for 
the ship as soon as we're dressed.” 

S ince the ship had to come from 
DesPlaines, it was eight days 
later that Carlos and Carmen Velas- 
quez left the Hotel Splendide for 
the spaceport, scattering largesse 
from the penthouse to the limousine 
as they went. 

It was good to fed real gravity 
again; it was vastly more than good, 
when, safely inside a private lounge 
of the big subspaeer, they were 
met by three particular people — 
two of whom were very special 
people indeed. 

“ Julesl ” a brown-haired girl 
shrieked, and took off at him in 



32 



IF 




a flying leap from a distance of 
twelve feet. 

“Vonnie! Sweetheart!” He caught 
her expertly, although her momen- 
tum swung him around in a full 
circle; and for a long, ecstatic min- 
ute they stood almost motionless, 
locked fiercely in each other’s arms. 

Yvonne pulled back a little, look- 
ed at him closely and shook her 
head. “I’ve got to have a picture of 
you. Both of you. They told me, 
but this is a thing that has got to 
be seen to believed. You always 
were a handsome dog, Julie, but 
now you’re simply beautifull ” She 
kissed him a few more times. “But 
I don't like that mustache — it 
tickles! You know something? I 
asked the Council to let me be 
Carmen Velasquez — begged them, 
practically on my knees — but the 
old stinkers wouldn’t. They made me 
take the thousand-point test, just 
like everybody else, and Gabby 
here beat me out.” 

Jules grinned. “Did you think 
they wouldn’t?” 

“Well, they certainly ought to’ve 
given me the job, since I’m engaged 
to the only thousapd-pointer alive. 
Anyway, I speared second place. 
I got nine eighty-nine.” 

“That’s mighty good going, 
sweet.” There was a brief interlude, 
then Jules, with his arm still around 
his Yvonne’s waist, turned to the 
two others, whom he hadn’t even 
looked at before. The man was of 
his own age, size and shape, his 
hair, mustache, and eyebrows match- 
ed Jules' exactly. The girl, too, 
except for costume, was a very 
reasonable facsimile of Yvette, pur- 

TWE IMPERIAL STARS 



pie hair and al. The man had 

been embracing Yvette ardently; 
the girl, having taken the towering 
ornament from Yvette’s head and 
put it on her own, was unblushing- 
ly admiring herself in a mirror. 

“Hi, Gabby; hi, Jacques,” Jules 
said, extending his free hand. 

“‘Gabby’, indeed!” the girl said, 
tossing her head in fine scorn. 
‘“Grand Lady Gabrielle’ to you, 
lout. I don’t think IH even speak to 
any of the common herd any more 
unless they come crawling, bumping 
their foreheads on the floor.” 
“Hear, hear!” “That’s telling him, 
Gabby!” Yvette and Jacques said 
at once, and Yvette added: 

“I liked wearing these jewels and 
that crown and stuff, darn it,” she 
mourned. “They did something for 
me,” and the conversation became 
general. 

Jules and Yvette took off their 
spectacular finery and turned it over 
to the new Carlos and Carmen. 
They had their hair un-dyed and re- 
barbered long and plain; and Jules 
un-waxed and un-curled his mus- 
tache. They donned shapeless brown 
trousers and jackets of homespun 
and became in appearance somewhat 
unorthodox Puritans. The switch 
completed, at the next transfer-point 
a new Carlos and Carmen Velas- 
quez, still tossing five-dollar Earth 
bills around like confetti, boarded 
the biggest and plushiest liner in port 
for a planet halfway across all ex- 
plored space. 

T here wasn’t room enough is 
Jules' cabin for him to pace 
the floor, so he stood still, with 



39 




clenched fists jammed into his pock- 
ets. Yvette sat on his narrow bunk, 
frowning in concentration. 

“It's like fighting a fog,” Jules 
•aid, scowling. “And yet everything 
we find is just too damned pat” 
“You just lost me. Fog, yes. But 
I haven't noticed any patness.” 
“Look. In sixty-seven years SOTE 
hasn’t found any evidence that Duke 
Henry of Durward wasn’t I, T, IT.” 
“Which goes to show that he 
was.” 

“Does it? He milked Durward of 
a staggering fortune, yes. Billions of 
bucks. But could he possibly have 
got away with enough to finance a 
project that big this long? And the 
others . 

“I see what you mean. Never 
mind the others, let’s pursue this 
one. Either he had help from the 
start or he hooked up with some. 
He’d have to, to do what he did.” 
“That’s sure. Yet nobody ever 
got a solid trace, ever. And the 
leads they did get didn’t point to 
anything solid; just to nit-picking 
•tuff. My thought is that every 
one of those leads was a trap — a 
trap that worked.” 

“And we weren’t trapped because 
we made them come to us.” 

“I’m not even sure of that.” 
“My God! Surely you don’t think 
this is a trap!” 

“Not exactly. I just think it may 
be. We have to follow it, of course, 
but we’ll follow it with our eyes 
wide open and everything we’ve 
got on the trips. And if what we 
dig up points to Durward — we’ll 
go anywhere else in all space but 
there.” 



“So you thing everybody’s been 
barking up the wrong trees and all 
they’ve got is forty-seven reels of 
junk and ...” 

“I said mayber Jules snapped. “I 
don’t know anything!” 

“Which puts you one up on 
SOTE,” Yvette said quietly. “That 
makes the most sense of anything 
I’ve heard yet So we jettison the 
junk and start from scratch ... the 
big question being — how? You’re 
implying a Grand Duke. We can't 
go running around sticking nitro- 
barb into Grand Dukes at random.” 
“How true; but you’ve read about 
how the old FBI used to catch the 
top mobsters?” 

“Uh-huh. CPA’s. 1 
“So look. Durward is in Sector 
Ten. Algonia is in Three, Aston is 
in Six, Nevander is in Thirteen and 
Gastonia is a rim-world clear to 
hellangone out on the edge of 
Twenty.” 

“How did Gastonia sneak into 
this muddle? It was muddled enough 
already, without another question 
mark.” 

“My own idea. Empress Stanley 
Five started exiling rebels there way 
back in the twenty-two hundreds 
sometime and they’ve been doing it 
ever since. What could be nicer for 
recruiting purposes? But to get back 
on the beam, the Head thinks this 
thing is getting ripe. If it is, who- 
ever’s doing it has had to do a lot 
of heavy work and spent an ungodly 
lot of money. You can hide a lot 
of building — armaments and such 
— even without putting it under- 
ground. But you can't hide big flows 
of money from experts who know 

I J 



U 




how to look. So if you don’t think 
I’m nuts,, we’ll message the Head 
tonight to check the growth curves 
of all the planets for the last seventy 
years and put the best CPA’s he’s 
got onto the top five or six.” 

She looked at him admiringly. 
“I’m for it; strong. And then we 
go to Gastonia, or wherever?” 

“No. Then we go to Earth.” 

She looked puzzled for a moment, 
then her face cleared. “I see. It 
would have to be a Grand Duke, at 
that, to get an agent into — and 
especially out of — the Head’s own 
office . and the brains would 
almost have to be on Earth. You 
care smart, Julie; maybe we’re getting 
Ttftoewbere, after all.” 

T he ship docked and the two, 
after killing half and hour — 
they expected real trouble, and 
preparations were being made to 
handle it — made their way to the 
middle-class dive that was the fa- 
vorite hangout of the lower officers 
and the highest crewmen of whatever 
subspacers happened to be in port. 
That was all they had — the name 
of the dive and a cryptic recognition 
signal bought for them by nitrobarb 
at the cost of a man’s life. But it 
was enough. 

Since the latest ship to come to 
ground was DesPlainian, the six 
bouncer-guards of the place — it 
was a somewhat unusual fact that 
all six of them were DesPlainians — 
thought nothing of it when half a 
dozen leather-clad DesPlainian 
spacemen came bouncing in, shout- 
ing for strong drink and friendly 
girls. 

THE IMPERIAL STARS 



How could the guards have sus- 
pected anything? Or the brains, 
either, since the d’Alemberts had 
pitched them such a nice curve? 
There was no evidence that the Ves- 
lasquez pair had anything to do with 
what had happened on Algonia. 
And if they had had, what were 
they skyshooting off into the middle 
of nowhere for? 

The renegade Puritans’ came in — - 
it was quite evident that they were 
renegades, since no Puritan in good 
standing would ever enter a bar — 
and looked unconoernedly around. 
Since it was early in the afternoon, 
only one bartender was at work and 
only a few waitresses and B girls 
were on hand. The two strolled up 
to the bar and Jules said, “I was 
told to ask for the Blinding Flash 

and say the Deafening Report sent 
» 

me. 

The entire room exploded. The 
six guards tried, but before any of 
them could get his blaster half into 
action he was struck by over an 
eighth of a ton of the hardest meat 
he had ever felt. In the same instant 
Jules put his left arm around the 
bartender’s throat and, with the 
blaster now in his right hand, drill- 
ed a half-inch hole through the PBX 
operator’s head. He then whistled 
sharply at the terrified girls and 
waved his weapon at a corner; into 
which they and the few non-combat- 
ant customers were very glad indeed 
to run. 

In the meantime Yvette had div- 
ed at the PBX board. She snatched 
the single earphone off the man’s 
head, put it on her own, let the 
body fall and sat at the board.

In two minutes the place was 
a shambles. When a five-hundred- 
pound pair of DesPlainian free- 
style brawlers strikes furniture it 
is the furniture that breaks, not the 
men. Two tables and half-a-dozen 
chairs remained intact; one savage- 
ly warring pair had gone straight 
through the heavy yellow-wood bar. 

And Jules, standing at ease with 
his blaster hanging at the loose, 
studied with keen appreciation the 
battles going on. He was not wor- 
ried about the outcome. Only one 
result was possible. The guards were 
good, but they were not d’Alem- 
bert — and those six d’Alemberts 
were the pick of the hardest-trained 
troupe of no-holds-barred fighting 
wrestlers known to man. 

In three and one-half minutes 
the place was practically a total loss, 
but the battle was over. The six 
survivors sported a few eyes that 
would soon be black, some contu- 
sions and abrasions, and several 
cuts, tears, scratches, gouges and 
bites that were bleeding more or less 
freely, but there had been no real 
damage at all. 

CCXTice work, fellows; thanks,” 

1^1 Jules said, as the sixth space- 
man came to his feet, grinning huge- 
ly. “Drink up. There’ll be at least 
some ginger ale left in whole bot- 
tles — I think. And break out some 
champagne for the cuties. I wouldn’t 
know whether they’re still in the 
mood for fun and games or not, 
but at least we’ll do the gentle- 
manly thing about the drinks. Now, 
barkeep my friend — ” he lifted 
that wight one-handedly over the 
bar, set him on his feet and put 



both big hands uncomfortably tight 
around his throat — “Do you want 
to tell me all about all the gizmos 
between here and the boss upstairs 
or do I wring your neck exactly 
like a chicken’s?” 

“I’ll tell, I’ll tell!” the man 
squawked. “Don’t wring my neck — 
please don’t! It’s all on the board 
there — really it is — the whole 
works!” 

“He isn’t lying, Julie,” Yvette 
said. “There’s a whole row of spe- 
cial red indicators that doesn’t be- 
long on a standard PBX. It looks 
like the boss rings down and they 
set the traps from the board here.” 
“That’s it, that’s it!” the man 
babbled. “There are blackjight 
beams across the halls up there, set 
to trigger blasters and stunners. The 
boss calls down and the man on the 
board sets up whatever he orders.” 
“Oke. What’s his door like — 
wood or steel? Locked? And how 
about guards up there?” 

“Wood. Not locked. No guards — 
no trouble ever gets to where he 
is, sir. He would’ve set ’em, of course 
— ” nodding his head at the dead 
man beside the PBX — “but you 
blasted ’im too quick.” 

“Oke. Lead the way. That’s so 
in case of trouble you’ll get it first 
— from me, if necessary.” 

Nothing happened until they 
reached the Boss’s door. The bar- 
tender knocked — no code, Jules 
noticed. A voice from inside the 
room called “Come in,” and the 
pilot opened the door and led the 
way into the office. The man be- 
hind the desk was alone in the 
room. He gasped once, turned pale 
and reached for a row of buttons; 

IF

but stopped the motion halfway as 
Jules’ blaster came to bear. 

“Go ahead, push ’em,” Jules said, 
but the boss, except for twitching 
muscles, made no move whatever 
as Jules gave the bartender a tap 
on the jaw, taking a hypodermic 
kit out of his pocket, went up to 
the desk. The man’s eyes widened 
in panic fear. 

“Not that — please not nitro- 
barb!” he pleaded, desperately. “I’m 
allergic to the stuff — it’ll kill me 
sure, my doctor says.” 

“What makes you think this is 
nitrobarb? It could be plain distilled 
water!” 

.“Don’t JTi ace me, mister! I think 
I probably know what you want . 
and you don’t need to give me any- 
thing! I’ll tell you everything I know 
without it, honestly I will!” 

And he did, and once again the 
d’Alemberts listened to the secrets 
of a traitors’ nest. And it was, as 
Jules had expected it to be, a clear, 
straight lead to one man in one 
city of the planet of Durward. 

“Oke,” Jules said, finally. “I won’t 
kill you — this time. Just tell your 
boss on Durward I’m coming; load- 
ed to the gills with stuff he never 
even heard of.” 

Then the eight d’Alemberts went 
back to their ship; where Jules and 
Yvette spent all the rest of the day 
and almost all of that night in the 
control room, the most secure spot 
they could find, composing and en- 
coding a long message to the Head. 

When it was done, Jules rose, 
stretched and walked over to the 
galactic chart. Her eyes brooding, 
he set it for maximum span and 
turned on the activating circuits. 
THE IMPERIAL STARS 



As the great wispy star-clouds of 
the galactic lens took form, each 
surveyed star positioned with minute 
accuracy, he keyed the index locat- 
ors for Durward, the planet to 
which all their hard-earned infor- 
mation pointed so surely, and for old 
Earth. Quickly the taped data spools 
whined and spun and printed out 
course and the dizzying distance 
in parsecs between the two planets. 
He said slowly, “All the signs say 
Durward is were the action is ... ” 

“I know, Julie,” said his sister, 
covering a yawn. “So, of course 
we go to Earth. Well, what are we 
waiting for?” 

VIII 

All explored space was divided 
into 36 wedge-shaped sectors; the 
line common to all sectors being 
the line through the center of Sol 
perpendicular to the plane of the 
Earth* s orbit. Each sector was own- 
ed , subject only to the Throne , by 
a Grand Duke , Earth, by far the 
most important planet, did not be- 
long to any sector , but was the 
private property of the Throne. Each 
Grand Duke had a palace , several 
residences and a Hall of State on 
Earth. Because of these facts the 
nobility of Earth were far more 
powerful than their titles indicated. 
The Principal Palace, in which all 
Grand Imperial Courts were held , 
was in Chicago; hence the Count 
of Chicago had more real power 
than most Earls and Marquises. 
More, in fact, than many Dukes .

The Massagerie 

I n his private office the Head was 
talking with a gray-haired man 
who, while old, was in no sense 
decrepit. Grand Lady Helena sat, 
shapely legs crossed, working on a 
twelve-ounce glass of cherry-ice- 
cream float. 

“But what does it mean , Zan?” 
the older man asked. “Route the 
Circus to Durward — with instruc- 
tions not to do anything whatever 
except circus routine. Carlos and 
Carmen Velasquez will not report 
and nothing they do, however wild, 
will be of any importance. And 
now this £eaw/y-parlor business, 
right here on Earth I It doesn’t make 
sense.” 

“Not a beauty parlor, Bill. A 
massagerie de luxe. Or rather, The 
House of Strength of Body and of 
Heart’.” 

“But don’t you know what they’re 
doing?” 

“Very little; and I don’t want 
to know more. I give them a job; 
they do it their own way. I would 
hazard a guess that they have some 
reason to believe that a specific 
person they are interested in is 
likely to take an interest in body- 
building. This, you will note, implies 
that they have reached the point of 
being interested in specific per- 
sons . but I don’t know who. 
That is to the good. 

“As a recent event proved, the 
less I know of detail, the better.” 
“That’s true. No trace of your 
missing person?” 

“None. There probably won’t be 
any until the d’Alemberts crack the 
main case. While they’re working 

38 



on it they get anything they want, 
with no questions asked.” 

“As they should, especially since 
they want so little from us. I know 
that Circus taxes are rebated, but 
surely they spend more than that 
on Empire business?” 

“My guess is, they don’t. The Cir- 
cus is so successful that its taxes 
are very high, but the Duke won’t 
say how high. I asked him once if 
we didn’t owe him some money and 
he told me if I wanted to count 
pennies I’d better go get myself a 
job in a dime store.” 

The old man laughed. “That 
sounds exactly like him. But Des- 
Plaines is a rich planet, you know, 
and Etienne d’Alembert is a tre- 
mendously able man — as well as 
being one of my best friends. Well, 
I’ll leave you to your work. I like 
to talk to you when I’m feeling low, 
Zan; you give me a lift.” He raised 
his glass. “Tomorrow, fellow and 
friend. May we all live to see it.” 
They drank the toast and Emperor 
Stanley Ten, erect and springy, left 
the room. 

Helena grinned up at her father. 
“You didn’t exactly lie, either; but 
if he knew as much as we do he 
wouldn’t feel so uplifted.” 

“He has troubles enough of his 
own without having to carry ours. 
Besides, we don’t know who they’re 
after. It could turn out to be some- 
one outside those six, as well as 
not.” 

The girl nodded. “If we had even 
a good suspicion, he’d get a shot 
of nitrobarb. All we know is that 
they haven’t got a shred of evidence 
of anything. But how under the sun 
and moon and eleven circumpolar 

IP 




stars can this glorified gymnasium 
help solve anything?” 

“I haven’t the most tenuous idea, 
my dear — and just between us 
two, I’m just as curious as you are.” 

A ten - story gravity - controlled 
building in the Evanston dis- 
trict of Chicago had been remodeled 
from top to bottom. All the work 
had been done by the high-grav 
personnel who now occupied the 
building. Over its splendidly impos- 
ing entrance a triple-tube brilliant 
sign flared red: 

DANGER — 

THREE GRAVITIES — DANGER 
.» 

and on each side of the portal, in 
small, severely plain obsidian letters 
on a silver background, a plaque 
read: 

duClos 

For weeks before the opening it 
had been noised abroad that this 
House of Strength would cater only 
to the topmost flakes of the upper 
crust; and that was precisely what 
it did. It turned down applicants, 
even of the nobility, by the score. 
Its first clients, and for some time 
its only clients, were the extremely 
powerful Count of Chicago, his 
Countess and their two gangling 
teen-age daughters. Since this dis- 
play of ultra-snobbishness appealed 
very strongly to the ultra-snobbish- 
ness of the high nobility of the 
Capital of Empire, “duClos” raised 
snobbery to a height of performance 
very seldom seen anywhere. 



“How*re you doing, sis?” Jules 
asked, one evening. “I’m getting a 
few bites, but nothing solid. But 
there’s a feel about Sector Twenty 
that I don’t like — I’m sure we’re 
on the right track.” 

“So am I, and I’m getting an 
idea. I wasn’t going to mention it 
until I could thicken it up a little, 
but here goes. You know that Duch- 
ess of Swingleton? That snooty 
stinker that’s supposed to be the 
daughter of the Grand Duchess?” 
Jules came to attention with a 
snap. “Supposed to be?” 

“Well, is then. Maybe I shouldn’t 
have put it quite that way — but 
you know how I’ve learned to sneer, 
in my own inimitable ladylike way?” 
“I wouldn’t put that ‘quite that 
way’, either. If it was me on the 
receiving end I’d sock you right 
in the middle of your puss.” 
“She’d really like to. I’ve been 
giving her the royal snoot all along 
and she’s burning like a torch. But 
her mother, Grand Duchess Olga, 
takes it in stride. So why wouldn’t 
Swingleton . unless she’s burst- 
ing at the seams with something 
she’s bottling up?” 

“My God, Eve! You think she’s 
the Bastard’s daughter?” 

“I’m not that far along yet; it’s 
just a possibility. Not daughter; 
sixty-seven he would be; she’s only 
about twenty. Still in the silly age — 
which may account for her touchi- 
ness and everything. She's beautiful, 
athletic, rich, talented, noble and 
spoiled rotten. Her hobby is men. 
She works hard at it. So my thought 
is this: if she gets the idea from 
somewhere that duClos himself is the

tine of such violence that the ap- 
paratus creaked and groaned and 
the very floor shook. 

“Now what a fair Earth gymnast 
— such as perhaps I’ll be able to 
make out of you — can do,” and 
they showed her that. 

“Now I’ll find out what you can 
do — if anything. You can’t do 
even fifty fast push-ups without 
going flat on your face,” and of 
course she couldn’t. 

He worked her fairly hard for 
half an hour, which was about all 
she could taken, then said, “That’s 
enough for today, poor thing.” Then, 
turning to Yvette, “Give her a mas- 
sage in steam, and go deep. After 
that, the usual.” 

“No, I want you to do it your- 
self,” the girl said. “They say you’re 
tops and I want nothing but the 
best.” 

“Oke,” Jules said, in a perfectly 
matter-of-fact voice, and peeled 
down to his white nylon shorts. 
“That’d be better — I’ll know more 
exactly how you come along.” 

The ladies-in-waiting were shock- 
ed — or pretended to be — as the 
three-quarters-naked man worked on 
their completely naked mistress; but 
Jules, alone, of all those present, 
was — apparently — not affected 
at all. He was a top-expert masseur 
working, at his profession. 

T his went on for day after day. 

Since the Duchess was actually 
a strong, healthy, athletic girl, splen- 
didly built, and agile both physically 
and mentally, she learned fast and 
developed fast. But for the first time 
in her life she had struck a man and 



bounced. It was an intolerable sit- 
uation — a situation that got no 
better at all as time went on. 

He stayed coldly impersonal and 
more than somewhat contemptuous; 
he was and he remained a master 
craftsman wasting his talents on 
material entirely unworthy of his 
skill. He paid no attention whatever 
to any of the little plays she made. 

One day, however, when she had 
become a pretty fair gymnast and 
was very proud of her accomplish- 
ments, all the ladies-in-waiting dis- 
appeared before the massage was 
to begin. 

“We don’t need them any more, 
I don’t think.” She pose4> wit b r her 
skimpy garment half off, and gave 
him an under-eyebrows look that 
would have put any other man she 
knew into a flat spin. “Do we?” 

“I don’t, that’s sure,” he said, 
with the sneer that had become so 
maddening that she wanted to bash 
it back into his skull with a sledge- 
hammer. “And if you’re trying to 
seduce me you’re wasting your time. 
You’re a hunk of clay I’m trying to 
model into something halfway worth 
while, and nothing else. I’d not 
rather have you than any other mass 
of poor-grade clay — or a dime’s 
worth of cat-meat.” 

That blew it — sky high. “You 
low-born oaf!” she screamed. “You 
clod! You base-born peasant, I’ll 
have you flayed alive and staked out 
on . .” She stopped screaming sud- 
denly and her eyes widened the 
veriest little. 

“Stop running off at the mouth!” 
he rasped, timing it so perfectly 
that she knew he had interrupted

her tirade. “My birth, high or low, 
has no bearing. I am duClos. I am 
trying to mold you into what our 
Creator intended you to be; His 
instrument to produce men, not the 
milksops and flabs now infesting this 
sinful planet Earth.” 

“Oh? Don’t tell me you’re a Puri- 
tanl” she exclaimed, very glad in- 
deed to change the subject. “I should 
have known it, though, by all that 
hair.” 

“An ex-Puritan,” he corrected 
her. “I do not believe that every- 
thing pleasant is sinful, but neglect

is. So get in there. And snap it

Work went on, exactly as though 
nothing had happened. She graduat- 
ed into the House of Strength and, 
everything considered, she did very 
well there. 

And she convinced herself quite 
easily that she had not revealed any 
tittle of the secret that had been 
held for sixty-seven years.

As an example of the traditional 
loyalty of the Navy: When Empress 
Stanley 5, her husband and four of 
their five children were assassinat- 
ed in 2229, their youngest child, 
Prince Edward, escaped death only 
because he, then an ensign in the 
Navy, was being guarded as no 
other person had ever been guarded 
before. Fleet Admiral Simms declar- 
ed martial law and, in the bloodiest 
purge in all history, executed not 
only all those found guilty, including 
Prince Charles and Princess Char- 



lene, but also their entire families . 
He then made himself regent and 
ruled with an iron hand for six 
years. Then, to the vast surprise of 
all , he relinquished his regency on 
the day that Prince Edward came 
of age and he himself crowned 
Prince Edward Emperor Stanley 
Six. (Farnham; The Empire , Vol 
1, P784) 

The Fortress of Englewood 

J ules and Yvette deigned to ac- 
cept six Grand Dukes and their 
wives as personal clients — among 
whom were Grand Duke Nicholas 
and Grand Duchess Olga of Sector 
Twenty — but that was all they 
would take. In that position of in- 
timacy they dug up a few hints, 
but neither of them could lay hold 
of anything solid. 

At every opportunity they planted 
Earth operators in the kitchens, in 
the garages and everywhere else 
they could. These detectives found 
bits and pieces of information, but 
they could not find any leads to 
Banion or to any of his blood; nor 
to the all-important Patent of Roy- 
alty. 

“We’ve got to take this to the 
Head, Eve,” Jules said finally. “I 
hate to yell for help on our first 
really big job, but he’s just too 
damned big for us. And it’s more 
than a possibility that it’d be the 
Head’s head that would roll, not 
Duke Twenty’s. We simply can*t 
take the chance.” 

Yvette nodded. “You’re right, Fm 
afraid. He’s really big . but he 
hasn’t got a drop of Stanley blood 
in him .

“Which is why he’s playing it 
this way,” Jules declared. “The 
power behind the Throne. I’ll set 
up a meet.” 

He set it up and they laid the 
whole ugly mess squarely on the 
line, and while they talked the Head 
aged ten years. When they were 
done he sat silent and motionless, 
in intense concentration, for a good 
fifteen minutes. They could almost 
feel the master strategist’s keen 
brain at work. 

Finally he lifted his head sharply 
and he said: 

“I was hoping it would be one 
of the others, but you’re right. We 
can’t move against him without the 
genuine Patent actually in our 
hands.” 

Jules scowled. “That’s what I was 
afraid you’d say. And that Patent 
must be in the solidest safe-deposit 
vault on Earth.” 

“It isn’t,” the Head said, flatly. 
“The Emperor can open any bank 
vault he pleases, with no. reason 
at all. So it’s in a vault as good as 
any on Earth, but in the deepest 
subcellar of Castle Englewood. I’d 
stake my head on that. Theoretical- 
ly, the Emperor could open that 
vault, too, at whim. But trying it 
would touch everything off and 
Nicholas might win. So I’m going 
to stake all our heads. No matter 
how daintily we try to pussyfoot 
it, there’s always the chance of our 
touching off the explosion. How- 
ever, there’d be no point in his 
killing the Crown Princess as long 
as the Emperor and the Empress 
are alive, so what do you think of 
this?” and they discussed details for 
two hours. 



T hree days later, the news media 
announced that Emperor Stan- 
ley Ten had had a heart attack. 

It wasn’t too serious, as such 
things go, but a battery of special- 
ists agreed unanimously that he had 
to have at least two months of 
carefree rest, preferably at his fa- 
vorite summer place, Big Piney in 
the Rockies. Wherefore Crown 
Princess Edna was given the un- 
usual title of “Empress Pro Tem” 
and her parents went, with no pomp 
or circumstance at all — not to Big 
Piney, but to an island in the Paci- 
fic that was guarded by every de- 
fensive device know to the military 
science of the age. 

And Empress Pro Tern Edna an- 
nounced a party — a getting-ac- 
quainted party that, beginning with 
a full Grand Imperial Court, would 
last for three days — to which all 
thirty-six Grand Dukes and their 
entire families were invited. And did 
any of the invitees even think of 
declining? Not one. 

As that party began, Jules and 
Yvette and a regiment of experts 
went as insidiously as possible to 
work on Castle Englewood. Having 
free run of the place, as far as 
anyone now there was concerned, 
the two went first — with stunners 
in their hands — to visit the key 
personnel. They were followed by 
fifty cat-footed, fully briefed d’Al- 
emberts, who took care of every- 
one else; particularly of the many- 
times-too-numerous Castle Guard. 

Architects and engineers had de- 
tailed plans of the castle, but they 
were found useless. The actual de- 
tails had never been registered. So 
electronic technicians unlimbered 

IF 



44 




their most sensitive detectors and 
explored walls, floors and ceilings. 
They traced cable after cable, wire 
after wire; and section after sec- 
tion of the vast building went dark 
and powerless. 

It had been clear from the start 
that this was no ordinary residence 
of any ordinary Grand Duke. It was 
a fortress; a fortress that, except 
for the Head’s brilliant strategy and 
the d’Alemberts’ ability to carry it 
out, would have been starkly im- 
pregnable. And, even so, the at- 
tack almost failed. 

“How about this, Major?” Jules 
asked, as the company, after ex- 
ploring all the other tunnels and 
corridors in the sub-basements, re- 
turned to a grimly thick steel wall. 

“It opens from somewhere, some- 
how.” The officer pointed out an 
almost invisible crack where steel 
butted against steel. “It’d probably 
take a week, though, to find out 
where or how. I think we cut all 
external leads to here, but they 
could have independent power in 
that section.” 

“We’ll assume they have,” Jules 
said. “And automatic blasters — or 
worse, stunners. Gas, maybe, or 
triggered bombs. But the Head gam- 
bled his life on a lot less than 
we know now, so bring up your 
shields and high-powers and burn 
the damned thing down.” 

When the eight-inches-thick mass 
of armor-plate fell inward into the 
brilliantly lighted room, revealing a 
squad of tremendously-muscled Des- 
Plainians, it struck a steel floor 
with a crash that shook the very 
bed-rock upon which Castle Engle- 
wood was built. 



One glance, however, was all 
Jules had; for even before steel 
struck steel he was smashed down 
flat by a force of twenty-five gra- 
vities; and the fact that the muscle- 
men inside the room went down 
too was of little enough comfort. 
They were weight-lifters. He wasn’t. 

U ltra-grav!” Jules gritted, through 
his clenched teeth. “Can you 
fellows do anything with it, Rick?” 
he demanded of the leader of the 
fighting wrestlers who had done 
such good work on Aston. “It looks 
like they’ve got me just about stuck 
down.” 

“We’re working on it, Chief,” 
Rick said hoarsely, and they were. 

It was fantastic to see two-hund- 
red-fifty-pound brawlers, muscled 
like Atlases, exerting every iota of 
their tremendous strength; first to 
get up onto their knees and then to 
lift, with the full power of both 
arms, a five-pound weapon up into 
some kind of firing position. Un- 
fortunately, one of the guards — a 
giant even for a DesPlainian weight- 
lifter — made it first. His first 
blast went straight through the man 
in front of Jules; and Jules, who 
had managed to get almost to his 
knees, lost a fist-sized chunk of 
flesh out of his left leg and went 
back down. 

Only the one guard, however, beat 
the d’Alemberts into action. In the 
ensuing awkward, slow-motion bat- 
tle eighteen men died; eight of 
them being the Grand Duke’s guards. 
Then slowly, ultratoilsomely, the 
d’Alembert found the gravity con- 
trols and restored a heavenly three 
thousand centimeters per second.

THE IMPERIAL STARS 




And Yvette, who had been pinned 
down all this time, rushed over and 
first-aid-bandaged the ghastly wound 
in her brother’s leg. 

They did not try to unlock the 
vault. It was too late now for cat- 
footing. Demolition experts brought 
up their shields and sandbags and 
blew the whole face of it to bits. 
They removed the debris and ran- 
sacked the vault — and they found 
a Patent of Royalty. 

Then, hearts in throats and scar- 
cely breathing, they looked on while 
hand-writing experts and document- 
ary experts gave that parchment 
the works. 

“This is the genuine Patent,” the 
chief examiner said finally; and in 
the joyously relieved clamor that 
followed even the dead were for 
the moment forgotten. 

The rest of the project went 
smoothly enough. The full regiment 
of Imperial Guards sealed the Prin- 
cipal Palace bottle-tight. The Navy 
put an impenetrable umbrella over 
all Chicago. Fleet Admiral Arm- 
strong himself led a company of 
marines into the Grand Ballroom 
and broke up the Empress Pro 
Tern’s party by putting Grand Duke 
Nicholas and his entire retinue un- 
der arrest. And immediately, then 
and there in the Grand Ballroom, 
the Emperor’s personal physician 
administered nitrobarb and the 
Court Psychologist asked questions. 
And Empress Pro Tern Edna, her 
face too stern and hard by far for 
any girl of her years, listened; and 
having listened, issued orders which 
Fleet Admiral Armstrong carried 
out. 

Since it is much faster to work 



such an inquiry from the top down 
than from the bottom up, full in- 
formation was obtained in less than 
a week. And thus, while the resul- 
tant vacancies in the various ser- 
vices were many and terribly shock- 
ing, the menace that had hung over 
the Empire for sixty-seven years 
was at long last abated. 

And thus — a thing supremely 
important to Jules and Yvette d’Al- 
embert — the Service of the Empire 
was at long last clean.

Because of their high intelligence , 
their super-cat agility, their hair-

enormous physical strength , D€S? 
Plainians had been the best secret- 
service agents of, in turn , the Central 
Intelligence of Earth, the Galactic 
Intelligence Agency and the Service

Plainians, throughout the years, the 
d'Alemberts had been by far the 
best. The fact that the Circus of 
the Galaxy was SOTE's right arm 
did not leak from . Earth because 
only the monarch, the Head and 
a very few of their most highly 
trusted intimates ever knew it. Nor 
did it leak from the Circus. Circus

was that d'Alemberts spoke only to 
d'Alemberts and to the Head, (un-

toward the roof of the Hall of 
State of Sector Four. This time, 
however, the little speedster was 
not riding a beam and there was 
no spot of light upon the building’s 
roof. Except for the light of the 
almost-full moon, everything was 
dark and still. 

Yvette was the Yvette of old. 
Jules, again short-haired and smooth- 
shaved, looked like his usual self; 
but there was a crutch beside him 
and his sister was doing the pilot- 
ing. 

She landed the craft near the 
kiosk of the ultra-private elevator, 
opened up and leaped lightly out; 
IwUvia -t»mho re d out, clumsily and 
stiffly; and Grand Lady Helena 
came running up in a very ungrand- 
ladylike fashion. 

“Oh, you’re wonderful, Yvette — 
simply marvelousl” She put both 
arms around Yvette’s neck and kiss- 
ed her three times on the lips. “I’m 
awfully glad father let me be the 
one to meet you!” She turned and 
went somewhat carefully into Jules’ 
arms. “And you, Jules! Oh, I just 
can’t — but surely you can hug a 
girl tighter than this, can’t you? 
Even with a bum leg?” 

Jules, returning her kisses en- 
thusiastically, tightened his arms a 
little, but not much. Then, lifting 
her by the armpits, he held her 
feather-lightly out at arms* length, 
with her toes ten or twelve inches 
in air. “Sure I can,” he said, solemn- 
ly but with sparkling eyes, “but the 
trouble is, I never hugged an Earther 
before and I’m afraid of breaking 
you in two. It wouldn’t be quite 
de rigeur, would it, to break a Grand 
Lady’s back and half of her ribs?” 

THE IMPERIAL STARS 



“Oh, there’s no danger of that . 
I’m ever so much stronger than . 
She broke off and her eyes widened 
in surprise as her hands, already on 
his arms, tried with all their 
strength to drive her fingertips into 
them. 

“Oh, I see,” she said quietly. “I 
never quite realized.” 

Jules lowered her gently to the 
roof and she led the way into 
the elevator. She did not tell them 
what the Head wanted of them and 
they did not ask. As the elevator 
started down she said, “Jules, I’m 
going to tell you something. I was 
all set to fall in love with you and 
make you love me whether you 
wanted to or not. But when I 
couldn’t make even a dent in those 
muscles of yours . arms as big 
and as hard as those of a heroic- 
size bronze . well . Her 
voice died away. 

“You couldn’t, possibly,” he re- 
plied soberly. “There’s too much 
difference. Three of your gravities 
is a lot of grav, Helena. But we 
have your friendship?” 

“More than that, both of you. 
Ever so much more. That, and ad- 
miration and esteem and . .” She 
broke off as the elevator door 
opened. 

She stepped aside; motioned for 
them to precede her. They took 
one step into the Head’s private 
office and stopped dead in their 
tracks, their eyes and mouths becom- 
ing O’s of astonishment. For — 

The big but trim old gray-haired 
man was Emperor Stanley Ten! The 
statuesque, regal, brown-haired wom- 
an was Empress Irene! And the 
beautifully built, prematurely stern- 



47 




faced girJ mixing drinks at the 
Head’s bar was Crown Princess 
Edna. 

Ihe emperor stood up and rais- 
ed a hand. “Do not kneel,” he said 
— but of course, with their speed 
of reaction, Yvette was already on 
her knees and Jules, gimpy leg and 
all, was on one. 

He raised them to their feet, kiss- 
ed Yvette’s hand and shook Jules’ 
and said, “During this visit and here- 
after in private, my friends, to you 
two I am Bill.” 

“Oh, we couldn’t, Your . Sire 
. not possibly,” Jules said. “But 
we might call you ‘sir’, sir?” 

Stanley Ten smiled; and in that 
smiling shed a heavy load. “Oh? 
I understand. Many of the younger 
generation are not so well bred. 
‘Sir’ will do very nicely. 1 take 
pleasure in presenting you both to 
Mrs. Stanley . and to our daugh- 
ter, Edna.” 

I ntroductions made, Edna Stanley 
went around with her tray, serv- 
ing Jules last. As she handed him 
his glass of lemonade her dark, gray 
eyes, usually distant, were soft and 
warm. “It’s a damned dirty stink- 
ing shame,” she said, feelingly, “that 
we can’t give you two, the two who 
saved our lives, at least a Grand 
Imperial Court channeled to every 
planet in space. And to cap it off 
we have to give that stuffed shirt 
Armsbold all the credit. The fat- 
head! And he’ll get another medal, 
I suppose — and compared to you 
two he positively could not detect 
a smell on a skunk!” 

“Well — ” Jules began, but the 
princess rushed on. 

48 



“Oh, I know that’s the way it 
has to be, Jules, and I know why. 
And I know exactly how you feel 
about it. The Service of the Em- 
pire. The fine tradition of the 
finest group of men and women 
who ever lived. But knowing all 
that doesn’t make it taste any better 
or go down any easier that all we 
can do is thank you for saving 
all three of our lives at such tre- 
mendous risk of your own, and that 
we have to do even that on the 
sneak — or cost you yours.” 

She threw her arms around Jules’ 
neck and kissed him warmly. And, 
while he could not bring himself 
to the point of kissing the Crown 
Princess of the Empire as though 
she were an ordinary girl, his re- 
sponse was adequate. 

Edna Stanley was not the crying 
type, but her eyes were brimming 
as she drew her head back, looked 
straight into Jules* eyes and went 
on, “But we three will remember it 
as long as we live; and you two 
will have a very special place in 
my heart as long as I live.” 

Without giving Jules a chance 
to say anything — which was just 
as well, since he could not possibly 
have said a word — she wriggled 
free and embraced Yvette. “What 
did you expect, Yvette? And call 
me Edna; we’re about the same age.” 
“I’d love to, Edna, it warms me 
clear through. What I expected was 
a pat on the back from the Head 
there and another tough job.“ 

The Head laughed. “You’ll get 
both, my dear.” Then, turning to 
Stanley, “You see, Bill?” 

“I see, Zan. D’Alemberts. Metal 
of proof. Wrought and tempered.” 

IF 




Stanley turned to Jules and Yvette. 
“You young people don’t realize 
that your lives are more important 
to the Empire than mine is.” 

“I not only don’t realize it, sir,” 
Jules said, doggedly, “but I don’t 
see how it can possibly be true. You 
are the third and the greatest of 
the Great Stanleys. Eve and 1 are 
just two d’Alemberts out of over 
a thousand.” 

“Correction, please. As of now 
you are, and probably for the next 
two or three years will continue to 
be the two most capable human 
beings alive.” Stanley replenished 
his drink and brought Yvette a small 
pitcher of fresh orange juice, while 
Edna ^waited on the others. “Let’s 
examine this ‘Great Stanley’ business 
a little; it will be a good way to get 
better acquainted. I’ve studied the 
House of Stanley quite thoroughly; 
enough to have developed what is 

— to me, at least — a new theory. 
Has it ever occurred to you to won- 
der why the three so-called Great 
Stanleys happened to be the three 
who reigned longest? Empress Stan- 
ley Three, thirty-seven years; Em- 
peror Stanley Six, thirty-six years; 
and I, who have more than either, 
and will probably — thanks to you 

— reign two more before reaching 
the age of seventy and abdicating 
in favor of Edna here?” 

“N-o-o-o, sir. I can’t say that I 
have.” 

“It’s a highly pertinent fact. You 
know, I’m sure, that only one Stan- 
ley so far has died in bed.” 

“Yes, sir, but . .” 

“And one died in a space acci- 
dent. The other seven were assassi- 
nated, usually by their own sons 

THE IMPERIAL STARS 



or daughters or brothers or sisters.” * 
“Yes, sir. I know that.” 

“They had too many children, too 
young. So Irene and I had only 
one child, and Edna wasn’t born 
until I was forty-five years old. So 
as soon as she’s able to carry the 
load we’ll hand it to her on a plat- 
ter and step out.” 

“Dad!” the Crown Princess ex- 
claimed. “You know very well I’d 
never even think of such a thing!” 
And: 

“William!” the Empress protest- 
ed. “What a nasty thing to say!” 

T he Emperor grinned. “If you’ll 
analyze what I actually said 
you’ll see that you read that wicked 
thought of regicide and patricide in- 
to it — and you’ll know why. Any- 
way, Irene, you helped plan it. And 
it’s worked out beautifully for all of 
us. You’ve all heard the old wheeze 
that ‘Power corrupts; absolute power 
corrupts absolutely’?” 

They all had. 

“My theory is that only the first 
part of that old. “Is really true. 
For, as a matter of fact, no human 
being ever had absolute power until 
King Stanley the Sixth crowned him- 
self Emperor Stanley One and took 
it. He had the whole galaxy. Every 
other despot in history was always 
reaching for more; so the truth of 
that old saying was never tested. 

“Indeed, there is much in pre- 
Stanley history that argues against 
its truth. The worst gangsters and 
the most rapacious capitalists Earth 
ever knew, when they got old enough 
and powerful enough and rich 
enough, turned from crime and ra- 
pacity to something that was for 

49 




the good of all mankind. And the 
entire history of the House of Stan- 
ley bears this out.” 

There was a short silence, then 
the Empress said, thoughtfully, 
“Well, it’s something to think about, 
at least . and it does seem to make 
sense . but my dear, what has 
all that to do with the present case?” 
“Everything,” Stanley said, deadly 
serious now. “It shows why these 
two d’Alemberts — highly trained, 
uniquely gifted, innately and com- 
pletely loyal to the Empire — are 
much more important to the Empire 
than I am. Not that they are in- 
dispensable. No one is. But they 
are at present irreplaceable and I 
am not. Any Stanley who is able 
to live long enough becomes a Great 
Stanley by sheer force of circum- 
stance, and Edna will be one from 
the day she is crowned.” 

The Emperor turned to face Jules 
and Yvette. “Nevertheless, my 
young friends, my life is extremely 
important to me. It is also extremely 
important to Irene and to Edna, as 
are their lives to me. Our three 
lives are important to a few real 
friends, such as Zander there and 
your father the Duke; but you would 
be surprised to know just how 
scarce such real friends are. The 



life of any individual Emperor or 
Empress, however, is of very little 
importance to the Empire itself, of 
which its rulers are merely the sym- 
bols. The Empire endures only be- 
cause of the loyalty to it of such 
people as you. Such loyalty can 
not be commanded; it must be 
earned. The Empire will endure as 
long as, and only as long as, it 
continues to be worthy of such loy- 
alty. Without that loyalty the Em- 
pire would fall. Instead of prosperity 
and peace there would be wide- 
spread and terribly destructive wars 
of planetary conquest. Our present 
cilization would degenerate into 
barbarism and savagery. 

“We Stanleys do what we can; 
but in the last analysis the Empire 
rests squarely upon the arch of its 
various services, and your Service 
of the Empire is the very keystone 
of that arch. 

“As Edna said, it is a shame 
that we three can give you only our 
thanks. It is not, however the thanks 
of only three people. I am speaking 
for the Empire when I say to you 
and through you to those who work 
with you . .” Emperor Stanley Ten 
took the d’Alemberts’ right hands, 
one in each of his own; 

“Thanks.” END

FIRE, 2016! 

BY GEORGE O. SMITH 



ILLUSTRATED BY NODEL 



Fire Is Man's oldest , 
best servant — and his 
oldest f fiercest foel 



I 

T 'he scene was eerie, as ugly as 
fire at night in a dwelling has 
always been and always will be. The 
searchlights of the fire department 
gave no feeling of comfort; rather, 
they added to the conflict between 
man and the element of fire. The 
dancing flames threw their yellow 
flickerings on the firemen as they 
raced back and forth arranging 



things, making observations, cal- 
culating how this fire was to be 
stopped. 

It was not done in silence! 

“Get that hose line in there!” 

“Get me a three-inch wye!” 
“Water ready.” 

“Pumper running!” 

“Steady, now. Steady! Got her 
set?” 

“Right!” 

“Okay, give her the works!” 



51 



The hose bucked as the high-pres- 
sure water hit the nozzle. It roared 
forth, arched toward the blaze, and 
crashed through a window The 
color of the smoke began to change 
immediately as the dancing flames 
within the house fought their los- 
ing battle. No more than minutes 
later, the stream of water was cut. 
The firemen went in to the house 
with hand extinguishers to kill the 
few remaining sparks and to quench 
smouldering embers. Now all there 
was left was the dirty clean-up job, 
and the task of packing the fire 
equipment and returning to the sta- 
tion. 

Fire Chief Mooney looked at the 
rookie beside him. “Still want to be 
a fireman?” he asked 

“More than ever,” said the rookie, 
whose name was Bill Lansing 

“Did this one give you enough 
to write your thesis?” asked the 
chief, pointing at the ruined home 
with his thumb. 

“I’m not certain. Could be,” re- 
plied Bill. 

“Well, if you’ve an idea, let me 
know If it’s good, l can tell you 
to go ahead If it isn’t, I can save 
you the trouble of trying something 
foolish,” said Fire Chief Mooney. 

“Chief, the process of adding 
something significant to the field of 
fire fighting isn’t very easy. On the 
other hand, it isn’t necessary to 
know the answer before you can 
point out that a problem does 
exist or that there is room for im- 
provement.” 

“This is true; of course, if you do 
a thesis on those lines it will get 
you your appointment if it’s good 



enough But it’s not the best way, 
nor the surest way.” 

“I know. But what can be added 
to the field of fire fighting in the 
year of twenty-sixteen?” 

“You’ll have to add something or 
you won’t be appointed.” 

“I know l didn’t mean that noth- 
ing could possibly be added, chief. 
What I meant is that a rookie can’t 
very well increase the scope of 
knowledge. Not when experienced, 
dedicated men have been working 
to advance the science. But I can 
point out one rather odd area, 
chief ’ 

“Go on.” 

“Chief, do you realize that here 
in twenty-sixteen, we’re still fight- 
ing fire in the same way that they 
did in the day of Julius Caesar? We 
pour water on it. All that’s changed 
is our more efficient ways of deliver- 
ing the water.” 

T he fire chief smiled. “Not 
quite Back in the day of 
Julius Caesar, they had private fire- 
fighting concerns, run as a business. 
If you were a customer of the 
Mooney Fire Company and your 
neighbor’s house caught fire, we 
wouldn’t touch it unless he were 
our customer too We’d go out all 
right, just to keep the fire from 
spreading to your house, but we’d 
let your neighbor’s house burn to 
the ground. And if your neighbor’s 
fire company happened to be a bit- 
ter rival of ours, we might even 
start a street fight.” 

“That’s not a matter of fire fight- 
ing,” objected Bill. “It’s just organi- 
zation.”

FIRE, 20161

“Of course. But I did want you to 
understand that things are not ex- 
actly the same as they were a couple 
of thousand years ago.” 

“Other things have changed, too,” 
•aid the rookie thoughtfully. “They 
used to race through the streets 
carrying buckets because they hadn’t 
invented the pump. The gizmo that 
Archimedes invented wasn’t much 
of a pump, sir. It was more of a 
water lifter. I grant that the mobile 
•team engine, with its pump, was 
a vast improvement over the hand 
pump . which was superior to 
the bucket brigade. Then the gaso- 
line engine replaced the horses and 
the high-pressure rotary pump was 
driven by the same engine when the 
vehicle got to the scene. But the 
same argument still stands, chief. 
For all of our modem science, we 
still pour water on the fire.” 

“I can point out one other item 
that’s changed.” 

“Yes?” 

“The nature of the fireman, Bill.” 
“Yes?” 

“A long time ago; in fact, it was 
a long long time ago, your fireman 
was not of an admirable, civic- 
minded character. The work was 
rough and largely physical, and its 
nature was such that it attracted the 
kind of man who did not mind 
sitting on his duff playing checkers 
for days on end, waiting for the 
alarm to ring.” 

“That must have been a long 
time ago.” 

“It was. Then came a breed of a 
better cut These men held jobs and 
public offices, and instead of a man 
joining the fire department because 



the job was easy, a man was ac- 
cepted by his local fire department 
in about the same way that a can- 
didate was accepted for a lodge or 
a freshman to a fraternity. This was 
the 'beginning. Fire-fighting opera- 
tions took a sudden upswing; the 
men took pride in their equipment 
and in their work. It was an honor, 
and they accepted it as such. They 
were not paid. 

“But the standard was set and 
the results were visible. And so now 
we have the present system of re- 
warding deserving citizens by ap- 
pointing them to the fire department 
and paying them an honorarium. 
This makes it possible for a truly 
talented man to be an artist or a 
writer, or to study for advanced de- 
grees, or to devote himself to civic 
betterment.” 

“This much I know.” 

“Then you also know that the 
mere proclamation that you pro- 
pose to be a deserving citizen isn’t 
gcrtng to make you a scholar.” 

“I do.” 

“And I’m also afraid that your 
criticism isn’t going to get you very 
far. I doubt that merely pointing 
out that we’re still dousing a fire 
with water despite our vaunted sci- 
ence is going to do it, Bill. The 
criticism may be valid, but in this 
case, I think someone is going to 
pose the question, ‘If, in two 
thousand and more years, no one 
has discovered anything more effici- 
ent, isn’t it just barely possible that 
there isn’t anything more efficient?*” 

“Thomas Edison had a slogan,” 
said Bill. “There’s a better way to 
do it — Find it!” 



54 




“Edison wasn’t always right,” ob- 
jected the chief. “And he could 
have made a vast improvement on 
his slogan by starting it with the 
word, ‘If.’ IF there’s a better way to 
do it — Find it!” 

II 

B ill Lansing’s thesis was thorough, 
but its scientific excellence was 
marred by a strong taint of emo- 
tion. His theme, that the basic im- 
provements in fire fighting were 
only to deliver a larger volume of 
water in a shorter time, concluded 
by suggesting that other substances 
and processes were ignored simply 
because water was so cheap and so 
plentiful that it hardly paid a man 
to rack his brains to improve upon 
it. It was, he said, plain laziness. 

Fire Commissioner Frank T. Ed- 
wards arose at the end of Bill Lans- 
ing’s treatise and asked, “I presume 
that you are aware of the funda- 
mental principle of extinguishing a 
fire, young man?” 

“Of course.” 

“Not ‘Of course.’ You haven’t 
proved that you know it at all.” 
With a labored, overly patient 
tone of voice, Bill Lansing replied, 
“Water is the total product of com- 
bustion; it can’t be oxidized any 
further. Technically, it is the ul- 
timate ash. As such, it smothers the 
blaze by keeping out the oxygen of 
the atmosphere. Second, the specific 
heat of water — that is, the number 
of calories required to raise the 
temperature of one cubic centimeter 
of water by one degree centigrade — 
is exceeded only by hydrogen. The 



on-pour of water therefore reduces 
the temperature of the burning stuff 
until the latter is below the kindling 
point.” 

“Then you will grant that insofar 
as its smothering and cooling pro- 
perties are concerned, there is noth- 
ing better?” 

“This I concede,” smiled Bill. 
“Since the substance with the high- 
est specific heat is hydrogen, sec- 
ond-best water indeed become firsts 
best.” 

“Then what is your point?” de- 
manded the commissioner. “If water 
is the best, what better can you 
want?” 

“My father,” said Bill, “was a 
fire claim adjuster. I learned some 
things from him — for example that 
the damage caused by water gener- 
ally exceeds the damage caused by 
the fire, a fact for many hundreds of 
years.” 

“Your father was hardly fool 
enough to suggest that we avoid the 
water damage by letting the fire 
run on,” snapped Commissioner 
Edwards. “What’s your point? Do 
you want someone to invent or dis- 
cover some substance that will do a 
better job.” 

“I am no chemist,” said Bill. 
“But I do know that specific heat 
is not the entire answer to the prob- 
lem of heat absorption. There’s the 
heat of conversion, for example. 
When the one degree centigrade 
variation in the definition of specific 
heat happens to span the freezing 
point, the amount of heat required 
to thaw a gram of ice into a gram 
of water — or boil water into steam 

is considerably higher than the 



FIR*, 20161 



59 




specific heat — maybe a thousand 
times greater.” 

“And you propose to use this sort 
of thing?” 

“It’s already in use,” said Bill. 
“When the water hits a hot fire, the 
first cooling is done when the heat 
boils the water into steam.” 

“And so we’re right back to the 
same argument. We use water, just 
as they did in Rome, because it is 
the best.” 

Lansing shook his head. “There 
are many substances with a higher 
heat of conversion.” 

“Yes,” sneered the commission- 
er, “and I’ll bet that when you look 
them up, you’ll find that they are 
corrosive as the devil, or that their 
fine high heat of conversion takes 
place either at minus two hundred, 
or at plus fifteen hundred. But let’s 
abandon that for a moment. Just 
why are you so all-fired interested 
in becoming a fireman?” 

4CT thought we were here to evalu- 

J. ate my thesis,” objected Lans- 
ing. 

“Young man, you want an ap- 
pointment to the Academy of Fire 
Fighters. You’ve received your prop- 
er degrees in the humanities and the 
sciences, and you’ve produced a 
thesis of dubious worth. I — ” 

“Of dubious worth?” exploded 
Bill Lansing. 

“Yes,” said the commissioner 
calmly. “I’d have said totally worth- 
less if I were as sure of my facts as 
I am of my opinion. This is just a 
simple admission that I do not know 
all there is to know about every- 
thing. Therefore it may be possible 



that your thesis has a trace of merit; 
now drop it, and let’s examine your 
motives.” 

“You can’t!” 

“Yes, I can: I have that prerog- 
ative as fire commissioner. I said 
‘examine,’ not ‘question.’ If your 
motives are above reproach, a strong 
mark will be made in your favor.” 
“All right. Go ahead.” 

“Isn’t it true that all you want is 
the honor and glory of having been 
appointed?” 

“The honor exists, sure. But there’s 
more. I am ambitious. I believe that 
I can go far as a member of the 
Academy Of Fire Fighters.” 

“And, maybe, a little ambitious 
for Gloria Mooney’s favor?” 

Lansing tensed, then controlled 
himself and said easily, ‘'Sir, a 
rather staggering proportion of all 
male effort is undertaken to make 
an impression on a girl.” 

“All right, I grant your argument. 
Ambition is by no means wrong.” 
Commissioner Edwards paused, 
then said to the assembly, “Gentle- 
men, I move that we do not accept 
this thesis, on the grounds that it 
offers nothing constructive. How- 
ever, for his honesty in telling of his 
ambition instead of mouthing some 
platitude about service and civic 
consciousness, I move that Bill Lan- 
sing be retained as a rookie and that 
he be urged to attack his appoint- 
ment-thesis from another angle.” 

T TThile fire fighting was still a 
▼ ▼matter of flooding the blaze 
with water as it had been for several 
thousands of years, the city of 
twenty-sixteen and its component 



56 



IF 




parts were quite different than the 
city of nineteen-sixty. 

For example, the word “dwelling” 
was still used; but it did not define a 
single-family structure situated on a 
plot of vacant ground. In even the 
least crowded areas of the megal- 
opolis that stretched from Boston 
to Washington, the dwellings were 
low structures, seldom more than 
three stories high. They were con- 
structed with an economy of build- 
ing materials by the clever process 
of using a single wall between the 
adjoining structures instead of the 
wastefulness of erecting separate 
walls for each building. 

In the more densely populated 
areas, the tight cores of the original 
cities, dwellings were veritable cliffs. 
The walls of the apartment build- 
ings rose sheer from the edge of the 
sidewalk, and each rectangular city 
block carried its own. Above the 
city, there was a thin, noisy popula- 
tion of helicopters. And below, the 
only reason traffic moved at all 
through the streets was because only 
essential vehicles were permitted in 
the dense knots. 

Had the Sleeper of H. G. Wells 
awakened, he would have found at 
least two things missing from his 
story. First, moving sidewalks did 
not hurl pedestrian traffic along a 
series of belts running at different 
speeds. There were no moving side- 
walks. Below the city, in the sub- 
ways, there were moving cars that 
closed tight, bumper-to-bumper as 
they crawled along the station plat- 
form, then stretched out into head- 
long flight to the next station. It was 
not a case of the quick or the dead, 
FIRE, 20161 



because he who lost his footing was 
merely thrust aside — or, if he fell, 
elbow, knee or anatomy was mildly 
abraded as he was moved to safety. 
Second, the clever little advertising 
gimmick of projecting names and 
slogans on the sidewalk couldn’t be 
done . because the sidewalks were 
elbow-to-elbow, cheek-to-jowl and 
nose-to-spine with those people who 
did not take to the subways. 

Within the individual dwelling 
units, things had not changed great- 
ly, but enough to make a difference. 
Wooden furniture was still present, 
but mostly in the form of a solid 
core or foundation for fabrications 
with a simulated wood-grain sur- 
face. Natural fabrics were not plenti- 
ful, but the synthetics were so num- 
erous that a story was told about 
using an alphanumeric computer to 
compose fetching names for them. 

One thing had hardly changed at 
all: The people. 

Oh, the faces and the figures of 
twenty-sixteen were not those of 
nineteen-sixty-odd by a factor of 
seventy-six years. But three gener- 
ations isn’t enough to detect a trend 
in evolution. 

Boys, for example, still called on 
girls — especially when they had 
come to a turning point in their 
careers . 

So Lansing said, “I failed, 
Gloria.” 

“But they kept you on as a rookie, 
didn’t they?” 

Bill Lansing looked gloomy. “Sure, 
but that’s sort of like handing out 
praise by writing it in Sanskrit and 
sealing it in the cornerstone of a 
granite building.” 



37 




“I still say you’ve got another 
chance.” 

“Gloria, how often do they have 
fires these days?” 

“Why, I don’t really know.” 

“I’ve been a rookie for two years. 
I’ve been to one fire. Things simply 
do not go Whoosh! at the touch 
of a spark any more.” 

“But doesn’t that give you loads 
of time to study?” 

“Sure,” he replied gloomily. “But 
study doesn’t solve the problem. 
I’ve read the detailed account of 
every fire in the entire megalopolis 
for the past fifteen years. It’s not 
enough. Nothing gives you firsthand 
knowledge like being on the actual 
scene of a fire so you can watch 
them work, see how they go about 
it and observe the results. So where 
does this leave me?” 

“Well, outside of being disappoint- 
ed, Bill, just where do you think it 
leaves you?” 

“I know where it leaves me,” he 
said. “I’m the son of a fire claim 
adjuster.” 

“Is that so bad?” 

“Bad enough so that your father 
gave me a rough time until I made 
the rookie grade and was on my way 
toward being a real fireman. Now 
one false step and I’ll be the son of 
a fire claim adjuster again. And be- 
lieve me, Gloria, you know as well 
as I do that the only thing worse 
than being the son of a fire claim ad- 
juster is to be the adjuster himself.” 
“Oh, now, it isn’t that bad.” 
“Isn’t it? Does your father know 
I’m here?” 

“He didn’t say anything about not 
seeing you, if that's what you mean.” 

58 



“Gloria, if you want to find out 
the degree of my welcome as a 
failed-to-make-it candidate for the 
Academy Of Fire Fighters, let’s you 
and I go and announce that we’re 
about to go dancing, or to a show, 
or something similar.” 

“All right. Let’s,” said Gloria. 

Ill 

T hey found Gloria’s father in the 
family recreation room watch- 
ing a comedy show. Here at home 
there was nothing to set him off as 
a fireman except for the traditional 
red suspenders that were, like a uni- 
form, the insignia of his position; 
the silver buckles indicated that he 
was an official of the Academy, and 
the four tiny shields embossed on 
the buckles denoted his rank as fire 
chief. 

He looked up and blinked as they 
entered hand in hand. A fleeting 
frown crossed his face, but it came 
and went so fast that no one, not 
even Bill Lansing, could be certain 
that the frown was not caused by 
the change in eye-focus from the 
bright viewing screen to the couple 
walking through the diminished light. 

Gloria said, “Bill and I are going 
dancing, dad.” 

“Dancing?” 

“Yes. The gang’s throwing an im- 
promptu at the Silver Garden.” 
“Oh. The gang.” 

“Yes.” 

“All right. You sounded as though 
you intended to go alone.” 

Bill Lansing bristled slightly. 
Gloria caught it first and squeezed 
his hand. He subsided without say- 

IF 




mg anything, and Gloria said gently, 
“Why, dad, we’re all big enough to 
be out alone. Even after dark.” 
Fire Chief Mooney looked at 
them and nodded slowly. “That isn’t 
exactly what I meant,” he said. “Jim 
Potter said last night that he was get- 
ting an idea for his thesis that he 
was going to work out in model 
form. And he said that if he fin- 
ished it, he’d be over to show it to 
us this evening. But if the gang is 
going to be at the Silver Garden, he 
will too. Tell him I’m quite inter- 
ested in his model, Gloria. Jim has 
a real head on his shoulders. Like 
father, like son, I always say.” 
“Yes,” said Gloria simply. 
Gloria’s father looked at Bill. 
“And how is your program, Bill? 
Got any new ideas?” 

“Nothing clear yet. I’ve a couple 
of ideas that need some study before 
they’re even presentable as possible 
ideas.” 

“Good. Come around any time 
you have something to offer.” 
Outside, on the crowded side- 
walk, they were part of the sur- 
rounded-alones that make up the 
population of any city. Had they 
stood on that same location fifty 
years earlier, they would have been 
truly alone, in the middle of a 
tract of land too rough for farming 
and not yet needed for dwelling 
space. Then they could have counted 
the dabs of sky-glow that marked 
the location of the larger towns hid- 
den by the slightly rolling hills that 
someone had dubbed the Watchung 
Mountains of New Jersey. 

But they were not fifty years 
earlier. Two generations of dwelling 
FIRE, 2016! 



construction had changed the face 
of the Earth. The first had cleared 
out the thin forestation and dotted 
the landscape with a polka-pattem of 
rubber-stamp houses built by the 
production-line process. The first 
crew dug for the foundation, the 
second crew poured it. A third re- 
moved the forms and installed them 
forward of the line, while the next 
crew began to put up stringers and 
studs. When they moved along, the 
sheathing came, the plumbers and 
the electricians installed their hard- 
ware, the flooring was laid and the 
walls were plastered, and the roof 
was slapped on. A coat of paint went 
next, followed by the real estate 
salesmen and their clients. 

And while the foremost was still 
digging holes for more foundations, 
miles behind them the sheriff was 
serving foreclosure notices on those 
whose payments were delinquent. 

The second generation of build- 
ing pushed the Watchung Moun- 
tains around until the terrain was 
level, and then erected row upon row 
of the two and three story dwellings, 
laid out in a closed formation of rec- 
tangles. This was the low-density 
population of the central megalop- 
olis. 

G loria and Bill were part of the 
surrounded-alones. When the 
density of population forces a man 
to breathe his neighbor’s exhalation, 
aloofness takes the place of privacy. 
It becomes a studied thing to not- 
observe; let some outrage take -place, 
and the people who stop to stare 
are from a distant part of the city, 
while the folks next door pass by 

59 




with the talent of a waiter who can 
walk through a crowded restaurant 
without letting anyone catch his eye 
or attention. 

And so Gloria and Bill could talk 
as if they were alone, and he said, 
“Well, that’s about it, isn’t it?” 
“Now what do you mean by 
that?” 

“There’s no gang dance tonight. 
And that Potter creep isn’t go- 
ing — ” 

“Now, don’t you go calling Jim 
Potter a creep. He isn’t.” 

“I suppose he’s a fine fellow with 
grace, charm, money, an interesting 
mind, sex appeal — and has the 
right to wear his father’s red sus- 
penders.” 

“Don’t be bitter, Bill.” 

“What else can I be?” he demand- 
ed. “Jim has a real head on his 
shoulders. Like father, like son, I 
always say. Come around when you 
have something to offer.” 

“Now, Billl” 

“That isn’t all, Gloria. He back- 
watered fast after that glum, ‘You 
sounded as if you were going out 
alone,’ line of his, but what is he 
going to say when his favorite, Jim 
Potter, turns up and declares there’s 
no impromptu dance tonight? He’s 
going to accuse the both of us of 
lying so that we could go out and 
canoodle somewhere.” 

“Don’t worry, Bill. There are ways 
of coping with that.” 

“For example?” 

“By proving that I’m not playing 
favorites.” 

“In other words, you’re going out 
with Jim Potter.” 

“Now you see here, Bill Lansing! 



I’ve got every right to go out with 
whom I choose. You have no more 
right to object to Jim Potter than 
he has a right to object to you, and 
neither of you has a right to object 
to anybody else. Now that’s not only 
clear, but it’s also logical and sen- 
sible — ” 

Bill put out a hand and caught her 
elbow, just as she was about to step 
off the curb to cross the street. 

The traffic light had flashed red, 
and the cross-traffic fought its way 
into the intersection without wait- 
ing for the last of the running traffic 
to clear. Bumper to bumper and 
curb to curb, everything came to a 
halt. Then came a crescendo of 
horns. The horns died as the inter- 
section cleared. There was a flurry 
in the vehicular pattern as one 
driver tried to fight his way from 
the middle lane to make a turn; he 
didn’t make it, but with luck, per- 
severance and the unlikely possibil- 
ity of meeting a polite driver that 
would give way, he might make his 
turn in the next couple of blocks. 

“Okay,” said Bill, disconsolately 
replying to her argument. “But right 
now what do we do? There’s no 
dance at the Silver Garden.” 

“So we’ll walk there, find that it 
isn’t open and then turn over on 
March Street and see if we can get 
tickets to Bitter Love ” She hugged 
his arm. “It isn’t a big event, but a 
girl can paste theater tickets in her 
diary, can’t she?” 

“I guess.” 

“So we were disappointed about 
being mistaken about the dance, but 
it worked out even better because 
we saw that big new hit.”

“If we can get tickets.” 

“We’ll get tickets,” she promised. 
“They wouldn’t dare refuse the 
daughter of Fire Chief Mooney.” 

IV 

T here was a murmur of voices 
when Bill opened the door with 
Gloria’s key. Gloria said, “Maybe 
you’d best not come in, Bill. That 
father of mine — he’s still up.” 
“The other is Jim Potter. He’s 
still here. Look,” he said hoarsely. 
“I’m not going to leave with Jim 
Potter in the house waiting to get 
you alone!” 

The hallway door before them 
opened to display Fire Chief 
Mooney, with Jim Potter in the back- 
ground. Gloria’s father used the 
voice that he’d found helpful in mak- 
ing himself heard over the crackle 
of open flames, the shouts of hard- 
working firemen, and the roar of 
newly-arriving fire equipment: “And 
how was the dance at the club that’s 
closed? Find the floor crowded? So 
just what have you been doing, you 
two?” 

Gloria replied, “Now father, don’t 
take that tone — ” 

“I’ll take any tone I want to in 
my own home! What have you two 
been up to?” 

“We got tickets to Bitter Love , 
playing at the- Orpheum,” said Bill, 
waving the ticket stubs. 

“Did you stay to watch the show, 
or are you using the tickets as an 
alibi?” demanded Gloria’s father. 

“Now, sir, that’s no way to talk. 
Don’t you trust your daughter?” 
“Yes, I trust her, you young 



schemer. But I don’t trust you not to 
make a fool of her.” 

“But I — ” 

“You, Lansing, might have spent 
your time better if you'd honestly 
tried to advance the science of fire 
fighting instead of thinking of clever 
schemes to marry into it. Hah! you 
yell about water, and how things 
haven’t changed for two thousand 
years. Well, while you were carping 
about water and lack of progress, 
Jim Potter was thinking . His idea 
will get him appointed cum laude, 
possibly summa , and maybe even 
magna .” 

“But, sir — ” 

“Lansing, I think you are a thrill- 
seeker. While you were complaining 
about lack of progress, and wailing 
that you couldn’t really study a fire 
and the methods we use without real- 
ly watching one, Jim Potter did what 
you couldn’t do. He has made a 
very sensible plan.” 

“Congratulations,” said Lansing in 
a flat tone. “And may I ask what 
it is?” 

“I’m proud to be the one to tell 
you,” said Fire Chief Mooney. “As- 
sume you are called to a fire in a 
dwelling, Lansing. It is yours to 
fight, to plan against, to lay out 
your campaign to extinguish the 
blaze in the shortest time with the 
minimum damage. Understand?” 
“That is the job of the fire boss, 
the ranking official present.” 
“Pre-cisely! Now, Lansing, sup- 
pose that you could make an instan- 
taneous determination of the amount 
and placement of all flammable ma- 
terial in the dwelling, the chemistry 
and physical characteristics of these 

IF 



62 




burnables, and the possible inter- 
action between the various products 
of combustion.” 

“That would be a help,” Lansing 
said thoughtfully. “It would be as 
great a help to us as it helps a gen- 
eral who knows the strength and de- 
ployment of the entire enemy force 
against him.” 

“Exactly! Well, Lansing, young 
Jim Potter proposes that every citi- 
citizen post a layout of his dwelling, 
and the contents, and the material of 
which the articles are made! This in- 
formation will go into a rapid cross- 
access file, so that the full informa- 
tion will be available as soon as the 
fire alarm delivers the identifica- 
tion of the dwelling.” 

B ill Lansing shook his head slow- 
ly. “I suppose you’d want pen- 
alties for falsification of the re- 
cords?” 

“Naturally. False information 
might be quite deadly.” 

“And sooner or later you’d issue 
licenses to purchase furniture and 
household goods to make certain 
that your records were accurate?” 
“Now that’s the first good sug- 
gestion that I have ever heard you 
make, Lansing. Jim,” he said to 
Potter, “I know you’ll give full 
credit for this suggestion when you 
present your thesis.” 

“Most certainly, sir,” said Potter, 
scribbling. Lansing raised his hands. 
“Chief Mooney, sir?” 

“Now what, Lansing?” 

“Before you continue along this 
line of reasoning, I think you had 
better consult an attorney for ad- 
vice.” 

FIRE, 20161 



“Why?* 

“Because I believe that any such 
requirement is a violation of the citi- 
zen’s right to be free of unwarrant- 
ed search. At any rate it is a viola- 
tion of his privacy.” 

“It’s for his own protection, con- 
found it!” Mooney shook his head 
violently. “What do you know about 
law?” 

“Very little. That’s why I suggest- 
ed that you consult someone who 
does. I think your plan would require 
a Constitutional amendment, a Su- 
preme Court ruling, and a special 
department formed to enforce the 
requirements. It’s a grand, blue-sky 
scheme, and totally impractical.” 
“Lansing, have you ever heard of 
the N.I.H. Attitude?” 

“No, sir. What does N. I. H. stand 
for?” 

“ ‘Not Invented Here.’ It refers to 
those people who go nit-picking and 
raising objections to anything they 
did not think of themselves. I with- 
draw my congratulations for your 
excellent suggestion because, it 
seems, it was meant as sarcasm. But 
to show you that we, at least, do 
not have the N. I. H. Attitude, we’ll 
still use your suggestion. It’s a good 
one — regardless of its intent.” 

“It won’t work,” said Lansing 
doggedly. “You’ll hear a yell about 
‘Police State’ go up so loud that no 
one will touch the idea.” 

“Now, don’t accuse me of advo- 
cating anything anti-democratic.” 

“I didn’t.” 

“Yes, you did! And if you and 
your kind would only offer positive 
suggestions instead of throwing 
stumbling blocks in the way of 

63 




progress, we would all be better off. 
You think fast enough when you’re 
objecting to someone else’s idea, or 
when you’re scheming a plot to 
squirrel my daughter out from under 
my eyes. Why don’t you bend that 
fine brain to something construc- 
tive?” 

“Mr. Mooney, I — ” 

“Lansing, you’re nothing but an 
inept social climber who is playing 
in the wrong league. Why don’t you 
leave quietly, you son of a fire 
claim adjuster?” 

“Now see here — ” 

“You see here, Lansing. Get out!” 
“Father, Bill Lansing is my guest, 
and I—” 

“You go to your room and stay 
there, young missy! Bill Lansing 
was your guest, past tense. No pro- 
gress, just water? Well, fathers have 
been pouring cold water over hot 
romances for a couple of thousand 
years, too. So get!” 

B ill Lansing’s return to his station 
was a doleful journey. 

It was late at night; or more ac- 
curately, it was very early in the 
morning. Crammed in and jostling 
were the night people of the city. 
Some were tired, some were bored. 
Not a few were dozing in their sub- 
way seats. There were many couples 
engrossed with their own business to 
the point where they cared little for 
their surroundings. But if there was 
one who could be as unhappy and 
frustrated with helpless rage and 
utter futility as Bill Lansing, it could 
not be known. For Lansing had no 
one to tell, no sympathetic ear to 
listen. 

64 



But if Bill Lansing thought that 
he had been kicked as low as any 
man could be kicked, he found that 
he had one more bitter blow await- 
ing him at the station. He was hailed 
just inside of the door by Fire Com- 
missioner Edwards. 

“Lansing, I have a complaint 
against you.” 

“A complaint, sir?” 

“Yes. Did you, or did you not 
imply that you were taking Gloria 
Lansing to a dance that in reality 
was non-existent?” 

Lansing gulped. It was a loaded 
question. In reality, the plan had 
simply been to test Fire Chief 
Mooney’s reaction to Gloria going 
out on a late date with her. It had 
been Gloria’s spur-of-the-moment 
picking, not his, that chose the 
dance. Bill could no more tell the 
commmissioner that they were test- 
ing Mooney’s reaction than he could 
permit himself to place the blame on 
Gloria. Neither was the act of a 
gentleman and a fire fighter; fur- 
thermore, he was at fault anyway 
because the code of the fire fighter 
demanded that he correct any erron- 
eous impression that Gloria might 
have given. 

But Bill Lansing had no doubt at 
all that the commissioner knew the 
entire story as close as Mooney could 
repeat it. For the commissioner’s 
word had been “imply” and that 
meant that Gloria’s statement had 
been undersigned; or in this case, 
underspoken, by Lansing. 

“Yes,” he said. 

“This has been an unfortunate ex- 
perience for all of us, Lansing. I 
hope it’s over. You know the penalty 

IF 




of the Academy of Fire Fighters for 
permitting an implied untruth to 
stand.” 

“Yes.” 

“While you are relieved of all 
duty and responsibility, you may not 
leave your station until the Board of 
Fire Regents accepts your resigna- 
tion officially.” 

“And if there is a fire in the in- 
terim, sir?” 

“While every hand is needed at a 
fire, Lansing, our code is our protec- 
tion. It is clear. No one who has not 
the full confidence of the Academy 
of Fire Fighters may have the honor 
of joining us in our chosen profes- 
sion.” 

“But, sir — ” 

The commissioner eyed Lansing 
coldly and in a sepulchral intonation, 
he said, “You have been weighed in 
the balance and found wanting.” 

It was the traditional phrase of 
cold dismissal from the Academy. 
The phrase was, indeed, a transla- 
tion of the Handwriting on the Wall. 

V 

TTTith absolutely nothing to do

It is worse when your cell can not

gave a tinkle. But the Academy of 
Fire Fighters was thoroughly fin- 
FIRE, 20161 



ished with Mr. Bill Lansing; so com- 
pletely finished with him that its 
members wouldn’t lift a finger to 
get rid of him. To them, he had 
ceased to exist. To place action be- 
fore the treadmill brought his card 
to the top was to recognize that 
such a person had rights. 

And it might have gone that way, 
right on out until Bill Lansing’s life 
turned a corner and became part of 
another world of activity. 

But a new world was not to be for 
Bill Lansing. Clotho, the Fate that 
weaves the lives of men, discovered 
the bowline, the knot that makes the 
closed loop which will not slip, and 
this she tied into her web. 

Call it fate. Call it coincidence. 
Call it anything you care to; but ac- 
cept, even though reluctantly, the 
fire that flared up in the cellar of 
Fire Chief Mooney’s home at one 
o’clock in the morning. 

The alarm clangored through the 
station, alerting the firemen, the 
rookies and the nearly-ex-rookie Bill 
Lansing. 

Next came the stentorian voice: 

“Now hear this! The address is 
one seven nine, three nine six four 
Rushman Avenue in the Watchung 
area near the metropolitan shopping 
area of Mountainside. The weather 
is clear. Temperature seventy-one, 
humidity fifty-three, wind from the 
southwest at ten. The time is one 
zero seven hours.” 

Near him, Lansing heard some- 
one mutter, “And the New York 
theater crowd will just be getting 
home, too!” 

In answer, the fire sub-chief said, 
“Right, Al. Look, you and Pete are 

65 




temporarily detached. Get out there 
right now and plant traffic stoppers. 
Go now; we’ll bring your fire gear 
in the equipment wagon.” 

“Right, chief. But won’t that leave 
you short-handed?” 

“We’ll make out.” 

Lansing said, “I volunteer.” 

For the first time in three weeks, 
Lansing got a reply. “We don’t ac- 
cept outsiders,” was the cold re- 
sponse. 

“Might as well use me,” said 
Lansing. “I’m going anyway.” 

“Not in any fire wagon this sta- 
tion uses!” 

From the roof of the station came 
the rising drone of a siren. It went 
up and up into a scream, undulated 
between shrill and ear-splitting, and 
then began to slide down the scale 
as the motor coasted to its well-bal- 
anced and near-frictionless stop. A 
banging scatter of cold motors came 
next; they settled down into a muted, 
vibrant roar. 

^top him from going they could, 
but stop him from watching 
them leave they could not. He fol- 
lowed them to the equipment, then 
stood on the edge of the roof, lean- 
ing into the blast of the big chop- 
pers of the heavy equipment. They 
wasted no time clawing for altitude. 
Instead, they lurched forward off 
the roof and arrowed straight across 
the . city, no more than a hundred 
feet above the forest of television 
antennas that reached up for them. 

It was a thrilling and a noisy 
spectacle, but once it was over, all 
that Lansing could do was to go 
back below and wait. This was a 
66 



world that had rejected him. A world 
that he was not permitted to join. 

He sprawled on his narrow bunk 
and listened to the radio. It was 
spilling orders and counter-orders, 
acknowledgements, and direction 
data and other information. To any- 
one not used to the patter, it would 
have been a hopeless mess of gabble. 
But to the ex-rookie, it was part of 
his nostalgia. He had the knowledge 
and the skill to build a radio receiver 
for this frequency (they could not 
be purchased) but once away from 
this station he would sever all ties. 
To maintain even the least of them 
would be more hurtful than not. 

One thing he could not envision 
was the spectacle of the Mooney 
dwelling in flame. That was a murky, 
flickering thing. But the approach of 
the sub-chiefs hopper he could fol- 
low without difficulty, for he knew 
that it would dip and circle the fire; 
the sub-chief would be collecting 
preliminary information so that he 
could plan his counter-attack. Then 
the radio became more orderly: 

“Redman, get the pyrometer over 
here.” 

“Right, chief.” 

“Harrington, get one of your 
spectographs aimed at that picture 
window in front. Put the second 
looking about ten feet above that 
tiled roof over on the side, and the 
third in the back. High, I’d say.” 

“Right.” 

“Now, where’s the XXXMIXXX! 
hosewagon?” 

Bill Lansing grinned. The fire 
radio band was speech-scrambled 
within weeks after it had first been 
used. Language that would offend 

IF 




the delicate ear was denied to that 
ear because the government realized 
that it was easier to conceal the bad 
language of men working under 
danger and stress than it was to train 
them to use, “Oh my goodness!” as 
a verbal indication of dismay. 

The sub-chief got his reply: 
“Layin’ hose, chief!” 

“From where, for XXXI !!'X 
sake?” 

“The Bound Brook Reservoir.” 
“What the XXll’s the matter with 
the standpipes?” 

“They ain’t been used in seven 
years, chief. Besides, we’ve got time 
to run a clear line before swoosh- 
second, and it's better that way.” 
“Okay. Now — ” 

“Who's in charge here?” This 
was a new voice. 

“I am. Sub-Chief Walter Lang. 
From the Newark district station.” 
“Where is Fire Chief Mooney?” 
“We haven’t been able to contact 
him.” 

“Commissioner Edwards?” 
“Probably on his way. And who 
are you — sir?” 

“Sub-Secretary of Public Safety, 
James Moriarity. You mean that 
neither Mooney nor Edwards aro 
present?” 

“No, sir. I — ” 

“I’m here, X#% %X## it,” came 
the unmistakable voice of Fire Chief 
Mooney. “And get me out!” 
“Trapped?” 

“Second floor rear.” 

“How long can you hold out?” 
“Not too long. It’s hot and it 
stinks of blowup.” 

“Do you want to take cognizance, 
chief?” asked Lang. 

FIRE, 20161 



“From within?” The sound of 
was unmistakable. 

“Well, someone has got to give 
the orders.” Lang turned to Mori- 
arty. “Shall we go in and get him, 
sir?” 

“How do you figure the fire, Mr. 
Lang?” 

“One mo. Redman, what do the 
pyros say?” 

“Hotspots running up to three 
hundred, bits and flares to five- 
fifty. Average is reasonable but 
going up.” 

“Harrigan, what does spectre 
say?” 

“The usual clutch of standard 
volatiles. You know. Polyesters, ac- 
rylics, acetates, eurenthanes, plus a 
mixture of ordinary smokes, wood 
distillates and monoxides.” 

“How bad?” 

“The mixture is deadly in con- 
centration, you know. Right now it 
will give a man an awful headache 
if he breathes it very long — say 
a half hour or more. But the temp- 
eratures recorded by Redman say 
that the mix isn’t to the whoosh 
point yet.” 

“Then I can’t take the emergency 
chance nor justify it,” said Mori- 
arity. “Where’s your fire claim ad- 
juster?” 

“He hasn’t shown yet. He should 
have been here.” 

“My God! Is there anyone who 
can work pro tern?” 

“Of course not. There never is 
when they’re needed.” 

M ooney’s voice broke in, “Is 
Gloria safe?” 

“Isn’t she with you?” 

6f 




“No. She has her own apartment 
on the top floor of this building.” 
“Front or rear?” 

“Front.” 

“And your wife?” 

“With me. But about Gloria — T* 
“Redman! Top floor front?” 
“About the same as below, maybe 
a bit cooler in the hot spots. Less 
total variation.” 

“Harrigan?” 

“Rough, chief. The whole, stan- 
dard list of hot, flammable volatiles 
are thick, plus traces of phosgene, 
hydrogen chloride and some nitrides. 
By comparison, Gloria’s folks are 
breathing pure mountain air.” 
“That’s an emergency, chief! Can 
we go in?” 

“General call! Isn’t there anybody 
who can certify this spot as an 
emergency? Anybody?” 

Bill Lansing could stand it no 
more. He got up from his bunk 
and snapped the press-to-talk switch 
on his radio. He said, “Sub-Secre- 
tary Moriarity from Bill Lansing. I 
am an ex-rookie fireman and there- 
fore disqualified to talk, act, or 
participate on that basis. However, I 
am also the son of James Lansing, 
a journeyman and fellow of the Col- 
lege of Fire Claim Underwriters, 
through whom I was granted my 
certificate of competence in fire 
evaluation.” 

“How fast can you get here?” 
“A matter of minutes if I can 
commandeer the hopper on the 
roof.” 

Mooney’s voice broke in, “Make 
him a #%& &#%% present of it, 
but get us the $#&& out of here!” 
Lansing headed for the roof on 

68 



a dead run. Meanwhile, a new voice 
came in, thin and wavering, on the 
edge of radio contact. “Am I within 
range yet? Do you hear me? This 
is Commissioner Edwards. Respond, 
please, over and out.” 

“We hear you now, Commission- 
er. Go ahead.” 

“How does it stand?” 

“It apparently started below, 
point and cause of origin unknown. 
The dwelling is a special,, belonging 
to Fire Chief Mooney. You know 
the place, Commissioner.” 

“Yes. Well, the elder Mooney 
dwelling, I do. But then daughter 
has a separate on the third floor that 
I haven’t been in.” 

“And the fire conditions?” 
‘Top-floor apartment, front side, 
isn’t as separate as if the place were 
truly unconnected. Therefore a lot 
of the volatile stuff has been seep- 
ing up through the stair wells and 
halls. It’s been collecting in Gloria’s 
apartment.” 

“Any sign of the girl?” 

“None. Harrigan?” 

“No trace of animal charcoal nor 
hydrocarbon vapor. She may be 
suffocated but she isn’t burned.” 
“Stop talking like that,” yelled 
Mooney. “Get me out of here and 
I’ll go up there myself!” 

“Is that an order, chief?” 

“Yes, #%& &#%% it!” 

Moriarity said, “Commissioner, 
the only fire claim adjuster on the 
spot is ex-rookie Lansing. You know 
him?” 

“Yes, I know him,” said Com- 
missioner Edwards wearily. “Lans- 
ing? Will you authorize a breach of 
Mooney’s section?” 



IF 




“Does Fire Chief Mooney wave 
his insurance?” 

“Now, see here! This is no time 
to — ” 

“If you’re going to accuse me of 
vindictiveness, don’t. Spectro and 
pyro give the Mooneys a good fifty- 
five minutes before the whoosh 
point and threaten them with no 
more than a headache. I’m mindful 
of their lives and of their comfort, 
but I have the property to protect. 
Furthermore, the real danger is to 
the girl in the top floor front.” 

“Shall we go in there?” 

“Without seeing it, I shouldn’t 
grant permission. But the reports say 
— yes, go in. Use the clear-out, 
grab and re-containment process, 
but be fast.” 

“Pyro, what’s the draft-coeffi- 
cient?” 

“Fairly slow. But once that roof 
is open, you’ll have a furnace con- 
dition in the whole place in a matter 
of minutes. All it takes is one ton- 
gue of flame to lick through a fire- 
break and — ” 

“Yes, yes, we know. Sky crew? 
Go in!” 

VI 

I ausing’s hopper crossed the 
ring of billowing red flares 
that barred all surface traffic from 
entering the area. Then he saw the 
stricken dwelling. Fire apparatus 
hung in the sky on their helicopter 
blades, hovering about the scene. 
As for the fire itself, there was not 
much to see to indicate how dan- 
gerous it was. Only a flicker and 
a flash of yellow flame showed at 
FIRE, 20161 



the windows. And, of course, the 
inevitable group of civilians huddled 
together in night clothing; the 
the dwellers on either side and to 
the back of the Mooney place that 
fronted on the next street. 

As Lansing approached, the sky 
crew went into action. The first 
’copter lowered carefully down onto 
the flat roof. On the bottom a six- 
foot, circular object began to ro- 
tate — the well-known but seldom 
seen sawing circle. When the cy- 
lindrical saw-teeth hit the material 
of the roof, the crunching noise 
could be heard above the racket of 
the many engines. It ground and it 
sawed, and the backlash from its 
effort made the pilot fight his stick 
to maintain hoverage. 

Then with a final crash, three 
things happened in so close a serial 
order that they appeared to have 
taken place at once. 

A slow-motion picture would have 
shown first that the thrust of the 
sawing circle and its helicopter drove 
the equipment down when the final 
resistance ceased; second that the 
pilot fought the thrust deftly by 
revving the engine and throwing the 
bite of the rotor blades to full life; 
and third that when the plug of 
the roof was lifted free, the gout 
of hot volatiles belched forth to 
carry the helicopter high and pre- 
cariously pitching in the turbulence. 
“Where’s the sky hook?” 

“Coming in, with hot papa in 
the iron claw.” 

“Ready with the flush tank?” 
“Ready!” 

‘Toss it!” 

From one of the helicopters, a 



69 




small glistening object arched out. 
With computer-accuracy it curved 
through the air to plunge into the 
newly made opening in the roof. 
There was no sound, but all at once 
the final billow of dirty smoke gush- 
ed forth and there was no more. 

“Snappy, now!” 

Hot papa, in his glistening fire- 
reflecting suit, was lowered through 
the opening. The iron claw line 
went slack; the pilot of the heli- 
copter hovered and fought his stick, 
for despite flushing the smoke out 
of the apartment with a tank of 
clear helium, the air above the scene 
was turbulent. Indeed, the helium 
did no more than to provide visi- 
bility. It was non-poisonous, but 
just as deadly for the human lungs. 

“Got baby!” came the cry. The 
iron claw line went taught again. 

“How is she?” 

“Alive and wrapped in baby’s 
bunting, double-folded with cold 
feet.” 

“All right! No re-contain!” 

T he sawing circle lowered 
again, hovered, turned and 
fitted the roof-plug back in place. 
Some battens were slapped over the 
circular cut and then there came a 
rapid-fire series of sharp detonations 
as anchor-fasteners were driven 
home with cartridge guns. The saw- 
ing circle .rose, followed by the 
first of a thin trickle of smoke that 
began to seep through the cut. 
Mooney asked, “My daughter?” 
Someone replied, “She’s being 
treated for smoke and vapor in- 
halation, some poisoning and a 
mild anoxia. No burns.” 



“Thanks. 

“Now let’s take care of the 
Mooneys,” said Commissioner Ed- 
wards. 

“Shall we go in?” 

“Lansing?” asked Edwards. 

“Look,” interjected Mooney, “if 
pyro and spectro say we’re in no 
imminent danger, we’ll play it by 
the rules.” 

“Yes, but as fire chief you should 
be here. Lansing?” 

“Mr. Commisioner, will the Aca- 
demy of Fire Fighters undertake 
Fire Chief Mooney’s insurance? I 
can’t underwrite it and accept the 
additional losses just to place him 
in his rightful command.” 

“Now I think you are being vin- 
dictive.” 

“Put yourself in my shoes, Com- 
missioner, and take a look from a 
long way outside. If I go in too 
soon, someone is going to accuse 
me of trying to curry favor with 
the very obvious combination of fire 
chief and father of the girl I love. 
Aren’t they?” 

“You’ll find, young Mister Lans- 
ing, that no matter what you do, 
someone will criticize.” 

“Then the best way is to do what 
I think right, isn’t it?” 

“Urn — ” 

“All right! Now get off the air, 
Commissioner, and let your data 
gang go to work.” 

Sub-Chief Walter Lang took over. 
“Data gang?” 

“Pyro here,” said Redman. “Gen- 
eral room ambient is about four- 
sixteen, with hot spots to seven- 
fifty.” 

“Spectro,” said Harrigan, “noth-

mg new to report. The same cross- 
section of gases from burning or 
decomposed plastic fabrics, artificial 
leathers and so forth.” 

“All right, plug your data directly 
into the computer.” 

The voices on the fire-radio band 
ceased. In their place there came a 
tuneless, and apparently patternless, 
mixture of short pulses in many fre- 
quencies from low to high pitch. It 
was digital data covering the com- 
position of the flammable gases 
within the confined dwelling, the 
temperatures found at a number of 
places within each room and the 
rate at which each factor was 
changing. From the computer there 
spilled lengths of tape, carrying 
their own computer code in punch- 
ed holes. These would be used for 
analysis later; the information they 
contained was already used and 
coded by the computer. From the 
collectable evidence, estimates and 
a computer-grade reconstruction was 
made of the conditions that existed 
in parts of the dwelling that could 
not be seen from the outside. 

W ithin minutes, the informa- 
tion was complete and the 
counter-attack planned with com- 
puter-accuracy. 

“Can we get the Mooneys, Lan- 
sing? Haven’t you stalled long 
enough? What’ll happen if we open 
that lower bedroom now?” 

“The computer says it is a little 
early,” said Bill Lansing. “And the 
book says that it’s frequently better 
to let it burn a bit longer and tend 
to smother itself. We’ve come a long 
FIRE, 20161 



way from the day when the first 
act was to chop a hole in the roof 
to vent the explosive gases. Now 
we can afford to wait until they 
get threatening before starting the 
inevitable Fire-draft up through the 
house. But my experience,” he went 
on, “isn’t extensive enough to fur- 
nish a considered opinion, other 
than to believe that there is a rea- 
sonable period during which only a 
computer could tell the difference. 
So I’ll say go in and get them.” 
“Thanks,” said Commissioner Ed- 
wards. “Mooney? We’re coming in!” 
“I hear you. We’re ready.” 

There was a quick roar of en- 
gines as the twin rotors of the 
flying bridge fired up. The flying 
bridge, parked in the street and 
poised for the operation, took no 
spare time in rising to window 
height and plunging forward to 
thrust its covered outrigger through 
the bedroom window behind which 
the Mooneys were waiting. Smoke 
burst forth around the bridge, and 
a gout of flame followed as the 
hot volatiles belched forth, rose and 
created an out-draft. 

The fire fighter in the hot papa 
suit aboard the flying bridge did 
not make it all the way to the end 
of the covered runway. The Moo- 
neys, she first and he second, were 
already aboard and running toward 
the body of the vehicle. 

“Baby’s aboard,” yelled hot papa , 
“and cryin’ for cool air!” 

The flying bridge backed, turned 
and dropped to the street. Fire 
Chief Mooney came out of the 
exit door, steadying his wife by a 
hand at her elbow. 



71 




Commissioner Edwards said, 
“Want to take over?” 

Mooney shook his head. “No. The 
headache they promised me is here, 
all right It’s a pip. I couldn’t think 
straight.” 

“You better get some treament, 
chief.” 

“After this thing is out. Let Lang 
go on. He’s done a fine job so far.” 
Walter Lang said, “Thanks chief.” 
Then he asked, “Lansing? When is 
whoosh second?” 

Lansing looked at the last tape 
from the computer. “We’ve still a 
large margin of safety before it 
goes whoosh,” said Lansing. “But 
I don’t think we’ll gain much by 
waiting, especially now that the 
bedroom window is gone. Hit it 
when you’re ready, Lang.” 

Then with the precision of com- 
puter programming. Pumper One 
hurled 1,750 liters of water through 
the smashed bedroom window; Pum- 
per Two delivered 2,500 liters 
through a second floor window; and 
a hose line rigged to the sawing 
circle dropped 500 liters through the 
re-opened hole in the roof. 

The smoke billowed briefly 
through the shattered windows; 
then made its characteristic change 
from dirty brown to the steamy 
white that comes when water fights 
fire. 

There was only one re-burst. Just 
as the mop-up squad was about to 
enter with their absorbent machines, 
a flare was seen in the living room. 
Pumper Two responded with an 
additional 500 liters, a quantity de- 
termined by human estimate and 
not by the computer. As a result 



the mop-up squad found puddles on 
the floor when they entered ten 
minutes later to finish off the job. 

V oices died around the table 
as Fire Commissioner Ed- 
wards arose; there was one tiny 
clink as one of the Board of Re- 
gents put down his coffee cup. The 
Regents of the Academy of Fire 
Fighters were present in their full 
red-suspendered regalia. But they 
were all uncomfortably aware of the 
stranger in their midst. 

For he, too, was in full regalia. 
There was the shiny blue-serge suit 
and the hard white hat of the fire- 
claim adjuster, and he carried the 
small, leather-covered attache case 
that contained the decimal comput- 
er used during on-the-spot estimates 
of fire, smoke and water damage. 

Commissioner Edwards said, “I 

am in the very uncomfortable posi- 
tion of having to offer an honor 
upon a man who has already re- 
ceived what he may well believe to 
be a higher one. In retrospect, I 
regret that Mr. Lansing did not 

make a material contribution to the 
science of fire fighting. He did 

not invent some new process of ex- 
tinguishing the blaze or eliminating 
the smoke, nor did he discover 

some fabulous new chemical that 
would kill the fleas without drown- 
ing the dog. In fact, Mr. Lansing 
did not even prove his own conten- 
tion that fire fighting was unchanged 
from the day when our remote 
ancestors discovered that water was 
the master of fire, provided you 
poured enough of it on the blaze.” 
“Indeed, gentlemen, I can only 

IF 



72 




apologize for being Impatient. I 
take the responsibility for having 
urged the premature action that re- 
quired a second charge of water, 
hastily estimated instead of care- 
fully computed, to be hurled into 
the Mooney dwelling. 

“But in the act of acquiescing to 
our premature pleas, Mr. Bill Lan- 
sing, recently appointed Adjuster 
First Class, and a member of the 
College of Fire Claim Adjusters, 
revealed a part of his human na- 
ture seldom displayed by other mem- 
bers of his college. Humanely and 
humanly, Mr. Lansing understood 
that our natural enemy is Fire, to 
be killed at all cost and at once. 

“And to continue this understand- 



ing and to hope that it becomes 
mutual, I am conferring upon him 
the highest office that a non-mem- 
ber can hold, the unglorious, un- 
dignified, unrewarding post of As- 
sociate Member. By appointment.” 
“And I,” added Fire Chief Moo- 
ney, “find myself appointing him 
to the post of son-in-law, first class. 
By marriage.” 

To his bride-to-be, Bill Lansing 
whispered, “I still say there’s a 
better way to do it.” 

“Than marriage?” 

“No. A better way to put out a 
fire.” 

“There is,” she chuckled. “And 
I’ll show you the way after the 
ceremony.” END

THE 

FINAL EQUATION 

BY JACK SMITH 



They expected to hear a revelation . 
They didn't expect — what they goti 



I n the semidarkness of the class- 
room the collection of intellec- 
tuals mulled over the possible rea- 
sons for their having been called 
together. They had come because 
Schuffman was their acknowledged 
master and because he was an old 
man, near death. They knew he was 
a tyrant and, at times, a crackpot. 
But no one could deny the man’s 
genius with figures. 

As the professor entered the class- 
room, his colleagues gave him a 
respectful, if not enthusiastic, round 



of applause. Schuffman walked stiff- 
ly to the front of the room and 
stepped upon the raised platform. 
Behind him was a black velvet cur- 
tain that concealed a blackboard. 
“Gentlemen, please be seated.” The 
professor was smiling. The thick 
lenses of his glasses made his eyes 
appear huge. “You are wondering 
why you have been called together?” 
Schuffman looked at the thirty- 
seven men before him. They sat be- 
hind grade-school desks and made 
notations in loose leaf binders. With 



74 



their features blurred by cigarette 
smoke and the lack of light in 
the room they looked for all the 
world like a class of aged fifth grad- 
ers. 

The old man smiled his all but 
toothless smile, raised his right hand 
and moved his right foot forward. 
Having assumed his favorite theat- 
rical pose he said, quite slowly, “The 
unknowns no longer exist.” 

A profound silence descended. 
Men in their forties looked in be- 
wilderment at men in their eighties, 
who candidly returned their glances. 

“We have always assumed, rather 
blindly, that galaxies are unique 
units. Well, they most certainly are 
not. They are only as unique as 
is one physical entity unique from 
another. It is a separation of mass 
and of mass only.” 

As Schuffman continued the room 
seemed to darken, almost imper- 
ceptibly. Only his face and the black 
velvet curtain behind him remained 
illuminated. “I have discovered the 
relationship between these sets or 
masses. There is a pattern. A key.” 

The scientists squirmed in their 
seats. They felt vaguely that they 
should be astounded. They did not 
yet understand why. 

“What is the importance of this 
deduction? Gentlemen, think. The 
person who could describe the work- 
ings of the universe in a single 
mathematical formula would be a 
god. He would be all-knowing. When 
will life arise on a certain planet? 
When will life on a given mass 
destroy itself? What kinds of life 
may evolve, given certain conditions? 
These questions that made mockeries 



of our pitiful intellects, these ques- 
tions would be child’s play for 
the person who possessed the equa- 
tion of the universe.” 

The tension in the room was al- 
most unbearable. Thirty-seven men 
held their breath. 

“In brief, gentlemen, I have the 
equation of the universel” 

S o saying, Schuffman pulled the 
velvet curtain back and reveal- 
ed a series of figures that had been 
almost carelessly scribbled on the 
blackboard. 

“Look at it. Look at it, gentle- 
men!” The professor’s voice had 
become louder and higher in pitch. 
“The universe depends for its very 
existence on this equation!” 

There was no sound in the room 
except Schuffman’s voice and the 
labored breathing of some of the 
elder members of his audience. One 
or two of them prayed silently. The 
professor was no doubt exaggerat- 
ing. Yet . 

“Look at it, you damned fools! 
You laughed at Schuffman before. 
No more! Now you will kneel down 
and ask favors like little children. 
I am like God. I am God — and you 
are all damned idiots!” 

Thirty-seven pairs of fists were 
clenched and white-knuckled. Thirty- 
seven pairs of eyes strained at the 
equation. Thirty-seven foreheads be- 
came damp with perspiration. 

Suddenly, from the back of the 
room, came a clear, well modulated 
baritone voice. “The equation is 
wrong, professor.” 

All heads turned to see who had 
questioned Schuffman. It was a 

75 



THE FINAL EQUATION 




young man, in his early thirties. 
Several of the scientists thought they 
recognized him. He stood perfectly 
erect and stared at the professor. 

“Who are you? How did you get 
in here?” 

“That is of little importance.” 

“Well, however you came in, you 
will do me the kindness of leaving 
by the same . .” 

“Schuffman.” The young man’s 
voice shook the room. It had a 
strange and fascinating depth to it. 
“Look at the seventh derivative of 
your equation. You have made an 
error that a careful high-school stu- 
dent could have avoided. The equa- 
tion is impressive — but it is in- 
valid.” 

An audible sigh went up from the 
thirty-seven men as they took note 
of the error. Someone laughed, “If 
the universe depends on that equa- 
tion for its existence, none of us 
exist!” 



N ow everyone was laughing. The 
sound of so much mirth din- 
ned in Schuffman’s ears. The young 
man’s voice was all he could dis- 
tinguish in the jumble of sound: 
“Erase the equation!” 

Schuffman knew he was wrong. 
He picked up an eraser and slammed 
it against the blackboard. The thirty- 
seven men were taunting him, 
“Nothing exists ... the equation is 
wrong . nobody here but us chick- 
ens!” they howled. 

The old man began to erase the 
blackboard with quick, agitated 
strokes. “Damn you, sir!” he scream- 
ed at the young man. 

As Professor Schuffman’s eraser 
ran over and obliterated the last 
symbol of his equation, the universe 
disappeared. 

In the void, the young man sighed 
and wondered what to call the eighth 
day.

The 

Store Of 
Heart’s Desire 

BY CORDWAINER SMITH 



Illustrated by GIUNTA 



Anything your heart desired 
was here — wealth — power — 
hatred — love — even deathl 



I 

T he animal-derived underpeo- 
ple talked about it for hun- 
dreds of years thereafter. The story 
became a part of their legend, their 
balladry. Real people, walking in- 
nocently around on the surface of 



the Earth, some kilometers above, 
never heard anything about it. To 
most of them, downdeep-downdeep 
was a place where robots and under- 
people worked to provide the lu- 
xuries, comforts and pleasures of 
mankind. They knew nothing of the 
mysterious Aitch Eye or of its 



77 



weird leader, the E-telekeli, and 
if they bad known, they would have 
been very surprised to find out that 
a true man had penetrated the ut- 
termost depths and had conferred 
with the Aitch Eye itself. 

Very surprised. 

But not interested. 

Why should they care? Curiosity 
had died out a long time ago and 
the attempted Rediscovery of Man 
was awakening it only very slowly. 
A few officials knew or suspected 
the whole story, but then officials 
never talked much. 

Only the underpeople cared and 
they were startled indeed. 

A true man in downdeep-down- 
deep? 

How had that happened? 

What could have gone wrong? 

Nothing went wrong. 

C’mell took him, and took him 
at the bidding of the E-telekeli him- 
self. He was an offworlder. He had 
the odd pompous name of Roderick 
Frederick Ronald Arnold William 
MacArthur McBan the hundred and 
fifty-first and he was the richest 
sheep-owner from the richest planet 
in the galaxy, Old North Australia, 
which most people just called Nor- 
strilia. He had gambled wildly, 
grotesquely, with help from his fa- 
mily’s old computer, and he had 
won the largest fortune in the known 
or suspected universe. With this, he 
had bought Earth. 

The name didn’t mean much. He 
was no crabbed financier, no em- 
pire-builder in civilian clothes. He 
was a boy, blond, tall, athletic. His 
shortname was Rod McBan. Though 
he was a mister and owner and a 



full-franchise landholder in Nor- 
strilia, he had been driven to ad- 
venture by mischance; he had not 
sought it for lust of power. 

He didn’t even go to downdeep- 
downdeep in true-man form. The 
traps would have killed him if he 
had. 

He had gone down disguised as 
a cat-man. 

T he cat-man disguise was not 
for the sake of downdeep; it 
was to keep him alive while all the 
thieves in space and Earth were 
looking for him. He had escaped 
death from the weapons of an old 
enemy, the Hon. Sec. in Norstrilia; 
he had bought Earth; he had aban- 
doned his cousin-sweetheart Lavinia 
on Norstrilia, at the urgent insis- 
tence of his own government, and 
he had arrived on Earth in a cat- 
body as the unwelcome but honored 
guest of the Instrumentality. The 
Instrumentality, which always ruled 
and never reigned, had even provid- 
ed him the undergirl C’mell as his 
consort and escort for his time on 
Earth; and C’mell was the most 
brilliant, the most beautiful, and the 
most enticing of the girlygirls of 
Earth. 

Knowing C’mell had been ad- 
venture incarnate. She had led him 
to things which he had not even 
imagined, including a knowledge of 
himself and of others. He had been 
places in the wet rich air of Earth, 
on the old streets and the complex 
cities, which no Norstrilian at home 
would ever believe; he had faced 
dangers, and now Rod knew that 
his time was drawing to a close. At

last she was asking something of 
him and he could not refuse. All 
the time he had known her — days 
which seemed as long and busy as 
years — she had been giving: of 
herself, her time, the risk of her 
life. Now, for the first time, it was 
she who asked. He could not re- 
fuse. 

He went with her down to a store. 
A commissary, run by a wonderful 
person called the Catmaster. Five 
hundred years old, and still allowed 
to live, and still allowed to run his 
store. 

It was called the Department 
Store of Hearts’ Desires. 

n 

Hphe trip was a vivid, quick dream. 

They had only a few hundred 
meters to fall before they reached 
ground level. 

They came out on the people- 
street. A robot policeman watched 
them from a corner. 

Human beings in the costumes 
of a hundred historical periods were 
walking around in the warm, wet 
air of Earth. Rod could not smell 
as much salt in the air as he had 
smelled at the top of the tower, but 
down here in the city it smelled 
of more people than he had ever 
even imagined in one place. Thou- 
sands of individuals, hundreds and 
thousands of different kinds of 
foods, the odors of robots, of under- 
people and of other things which 
seemed to be unmodified animals. 

“This is the most interesting-smell- 
ing place I have ever been,” said 
he to C’mell. 



She glanced at him idly. "That’s 
nice. You can smell like a dog-man. 
Most of the real people I have 
known couldn’t smell their own feet. 
Come on though, C’roderick — re - 
member who you are! If we’re not 
tagged and licensed for the surface, 
we’ll get stopped by that policeman 
in one minute or less.” 

She carried E-ikasus and steered 
Rod with a pressure on his elbow. 
They came to a ramp which led to 
an underground passage, well illu- 
minated. Machines, robots and un- 
derpeople were hurrying back and 
forth along it, busy with the com- 
merce of Earth. 

Rod would have been completely 
lost if he had been without C’mell. 
Though his miraculous broad-band 
hiering, which had so often sur- 
prised him and pleased him at home, 
had not returned during his few 
hours on Old Earth, his other senses 
gave him a suffocating awareness of 
the huge number of people around 
him and above him. (He never 
realized that there were times, long 
gone, when the cities of Earth had 
populations which reached the tens 
of millions. To him, several hundred 
thousand people, and a comparable 
number of underpeople, was a crowd 
almost beyond measure.) 

The sounds and smells of under- 
people were subtly different from 
those of people; some of the ma- 
chines of Earth were bigger and 
older than anything which he had 
previously imagined; and above all, 
the circulation of water in immense 
volumes, millions upon millions of 
gallons, for the multiple purposes 
of Earthport — sanitation, cool- 

IF 



80 




ing, drinking, industrial purposes — 
made him feel that he was not 
among a few buildings, which he 
would have called a city in Old 
North Australia, but that he himself 
had become a blood-cell thrusting 
through the circulatory system of 
some enormous composite animal, 
the nature of which he imperfectly 
understood. This city was alive with 
a sticky, wet, complicated aliveness 
Which he had hitherto not even im- 
agined to be possible. Movement 
characterized it. He suspected that 
the movement went on by night and 
day, that there was no real cessation 
to it, that the great pumps thrust 
water through feeder pipes and 
drains whether people were awake 
or not. that the brains of this or- 
ganization could be no one place, 
but had to comprise many sub- 
brains, each committed and respon- 
sible for its particular tasks. 

No wonder underpeople were 
needed! It would be boredom and 
pain, even with perfected automa- 
tion, to have enough human super- 
visors to reconnect the various sys- 
tems if they had breakdowns inside 
themselves or at their interconnec- 
tions. Old North Australia had vi- 
talitv. But it was the vitality of open 
fields, few people, immense wealth, 
and perpetual military danger. This 
was the vitality of the cesspool or 
the compost heap, blit the rotting, 
blooming components were not 
waste material, but human beings 
and near-human beings. 

No wonder that his forefathers 
had fled the cities as they had been. 
They must have been solid plague 
to free men. And even Old Original 

THE STORE OF HEART'S DESIRI 



Australia, somewhere here on Earth, 
had lost its openness and freedom in 
order to become the single giant 
city-complex of Nanbien. It must, 
Rod thought with horror, have been 
a thousand times the size of this 
city of Earthport. (He was wrong, 
because it reached three hundred 
thousand times the size of Earthport 
before it died. Earthport had only 
about two hundred thousand perma- 
nent residents when Rod visited it, 
with an additional number walking 
in from the nearer suburbs, the 
outer suburbs still being ruined and 
abandoned. But Australia — under 
the name of Aojou Nanbien — had 
reached a population of thirty bil- 
lion before it died, and before the 
Wild Ones and the Menschenjager 
had set to work killing off the sur- 
vivors.) 

R od was bewildered, but C’mell 
was not. She put A’gentur 
down, over his whined monkey-like 
protest. He trotted unwillingly be- 
side them. 

With the impudent knowledgeabili- 
ty of a true city girl, she led them 
to a cross-walk from which a con- 
tinuous whistling roar came forth. 
By writing, by picture, and by loud- 
speaker, the warning system repeat- 
ed, KEEP OFF. FREIGHT ONLY. 
DANGER. KEEP OFF. She snatch- 
ed up E-ikasus A’gentur, grabbed 
Rod by the arm, and jumped with 
them on a series of rapidly-moving 
airborne platforms. Rod, startled by 
the suddenness in which they had 
found the trackway, shouted to ask 
what it was: 

“Freight? What’s that?” 



81 




•Things, Boxes. Food. This is 
the Central trackway. No sense in 
walking six kilometers when we can 
get this. Be ready to jump off with 
me when I give you the sign!” 

Tt feels dangerous,” he said. 

“It isn’t,” said she, “not if you’re 
a cat.” 

With this somewhat equivocal re- 
assurance, she let them ride. A’gen- 
tur could not care less. He cuddled 
his head against her shoulder, wrap- 
ped his long gibbon-like arms around 
her upper arm and went soundly 
to sleep. 

C’mell nodded at Rod. “Soon 
now!” she called, judging their dis- 
tance by landmarks which he found 
meaningless. The landing points had 
flat, concrete-lined areas where the 
individual flat cars, rushing along 
on their river of air, could be shunt- 
ed suddenly to the side for loading 
or unloading. Each of these loading 
areas had a number, but Rod had 
not even noticed at what point they 
had gotten on. The smells of the 
underground city changed so much 
as they moved from one district to 
another that he was more interested 
in odors than in the numbers on 
the platforms. 

She pinched his upper arm very 
sharply as a sign that he should 
get ready. 

They jumped. 

He staggered across the platform 
until he caught himself up against 
a large vertical crate marked Al- 
gonquin Paper Works — Credit 
Slips, Miniature — 2m. C’mell land- 
ed as gracefully as if she had been 
acting a rehearsed piece of acroba- 
tics. The little monkey on her 

82 



shoulder stared with wide bright 

eyes. 

“This,” said the monkey A’gentur- 
Eikasus firmly and contemptuously, 
“is where all the people play at 
working. I’m tired, I’m hungry and 
my body sugar is low.” He curled 
himself tight against C’mell’s shoul- 
der, closed his eyes and went back 
to sleep. 

“He has a point,” said Rod. 
“Could we eat?” 

Cmell started to nod and then 
caught herself short “You’re a cat,” 
you know. 

He nodded. Then he grinned. “I’m 
hungry, anyhow. And I need a sand- 
box.” 

“Sandbox?” she said, staring at 
him. 

“An awef,” he said very clearly, 
using the Old North Australian term. 

“Awef?” 

It was his turn to get embarrassed. 
He said it in full: “An animal waste 
evacuation facility.” 

“You mean a johnny,” she cried. 
She thought a minute and then said, 
“Fooey.” 

“What’s the matter?” he asked, 

puzzled. 

“Each kind of underpeople has 
to use its own. It’s death if you 
don’t use one and it's death if you 
use the wrong one. The cat one fa 
four stations back on this under- 
ground trackway. Or we can walk 
back on the surface. It would only 
be a half hour.” 

He said something rude to Earth. 
She wrinkled her brow. 

“All I said was, ‘Earth fa a large 
healthy sheep.’ That # s not so dirty.” 
Her good humor returned. 



IP 




B efore she could ask him another 
question he held up a firm 
hand. “I am not going to waste a 
half hour. You wait here.” He had 
seen the universal sign for “men’s 
room” at the upper level of the 
platform. Before she could stop him 
he had gone into it. She caught her 
hand up to her mouth, knowing 
that the robot police would kill him 
on sight if they found him in the 
wrong place. It would be such a 
ghastly joke if the man who owned 
the earth were to die in the wrong 
toilet. 

As quick as thought she followed 
him, stopping just outside the door 
to the “men’s room.” She dared 
not to go in; she trusted that the 
place was empty when Rod entered 
it, because she had heard no boom 
of a slow, heavy bullet, none of 
the crisp buzzing of a burner. Ro- 
bots did not use toilets, so they 
went in only when they were inves- 
tigating something. She was pre- 
pared to distract any man living if 
he tried to enter that toilet by offer- 
ing him the combination of an 
Immediate seduction or a compli- 
mentary and unwanted monkey. 
A'gentur had waked up. 

“Don’t bother,” he said. “I called 
my father. Anything approaching 
that door will fall asleep.” 

An ordinary man, rather tired 
and worried-looking, headed for the 
men’s room. CmeH was prepared to 
stop him at any cost, but she re- 
membered what A’gentur-E-ikasus 
had told her, so she waited. The 
man reeled as he neared them. He 
stared at them, saw that they were 
underpeople, looked on through 

THE STORE Of HEART'S DESIRI 



them as though they were not 
there. He took two more steps to- 
ward the door and suddenly reach- 
ed out his hands as if he were 
going blind. He walked into the 
wall two meters from the door, 
touched it firmly and blindly with 
his hands and crumpled gently to 
the floor, where he lay snoring. 

“My dad’s good,” said A’gentur- 
E-ikasus. “He usually leaves real 
people alone, but when he must 
get them, he gets them. He even 
gave that man the distinct memory 
that he mistakenly took a sleeping 
pill when he was reaching for a 
pain-killer. When the human wakes 
up, he will feel foolish and will tell 
no one of his experience.” 

Rod came out of the ever-so- 
dangerous doorway. He grinned at 
them boyishly and did not notice 
the crumpled man lying beside the 
wall. “That’s easier than turning 
back, and nobody noticed me at 
all.” 

He was so proud of his foolhardy 
adventure that she did not have the 
heart to blame him. He smiled wide- 
ly, his cat-whiskers tipping as he 
did so. For a moment, just a mo- 
ment, she forgot that he was an 
important person and a real man 
to boot. He was a boy, and mighty 
like a cat, but all boy in his satis- 
faction, his wanton bravery, his pass- 
ing happiness with vainglory. For a 
second or two she loved him. 

Then she thought of the terrible 
hours ahead, and of how he would 
go home, rich and scornful, to his 
all-people planet. The moment of 
love passed but she still liked him 
very much.

“Come along, young fellow. You 
can eat. You are going to eat cat 
food since you are C’roderick, but 
it’s not so bad.” 

He frowned. “What is it? Do you 
have fish here? 1 tasted fish one 
time. A neighbor bought one. He 
traded two horses for it. It was 
delicious.” 

“He wants fish,” she cried to 
E-ikasus. 

“Give him a whole tuna for him- 
self,” grumbed the monkey. “My 
blood sugar is still low. I need some 
pineapple.” 

C 'mell did not argue. She stayed 
underground and led them 
into a hall which had a picture of 
dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, bears and 
snakes above the door; that indicat- 
ed the kinds of people who could be 
served there. E-ikasus scowled at 
the sign but he rode C’mell’s shoul- 
der in. 

“This gentlemen,” said C’mell, 
speaking pleasantly to an old bear- 
man who was scratching his belly 
and smoking a pipe, all at the same 
time, “has forgotten his credits.” 
“No food,” said the bear-man. 
“Rules. He can drink water, 
though.” 

“I’ll pay for him,” said C’mell. 
The bear-jnan yawned. “Are 
you sure that he won’t pay you 
back? If he does, that is private 
trading and it is punished by death.” 
“I know the rules,” said C’mell. 
“I’ve never been disciplined yet.” 
The bear looked her over criti- 
cally. He took his pipe out of his 
mouth and whistled. “No,” said he, 
“and I can see that you won’t be. 

84 



What are you, anyhow? A model.” 
“A girlygirl,” said C’mell. 

The bear-man leapt from his 
stool with astonishing speed. “Cat- 
madam!” he cried. “A thousand 
pardons. You can have anything 
in the place. You come from the 
top of Earthport? You know the 
Lords of the Instrumentality per- 
sonally? You would like a table 
roped off with curtains? Or should 
I just throw everybody else out of 
here and report to my Man that 
we have a famous, beautiful slave 
from the highplaces?” 

“Nothing that drastic,” said 
C’mell. “Just food.” 

“Wait a bit,” said A’gentur E- 
ikasus, “if you’re offering specials, 
I’ll have two fresh pineapples, a 
quarter-kilo of ground fresh coco- 
nut and a tenth of a kilo of live 
insect grubs.” 

The bear-man hesitated. “I was 
offering things to the cat-lady, who 
serves the mighty ones, not to you, 
monkey. But if the lady desires it, 
I will send for those things.” He 
waited for C’mell’s nod, got it, and 
pushed a button for a low-grade 
robot to come. He turned to Rod 
McBan, “And you, cat-gentleman. 
What would you like?” 

Before Rod could speak, C’mell 
said, “He wants two sailfish steaks, 
french fried potatoes, Waldorf sal- 
ad, an order of ice cream and a 
large glass of orange juice.” 

The bear-man shuddered visibly. 
“I’ve been here for many years and 
that is the most horrible lunch I 
ever ordered for a cat. I think Fll 
try it myself.” 

C’mell smiled the smile which 

IF 




had graced a thousand welcomes. 
“I’ll just help myself from the 
things you have on the counters. 
I’m not fussy.” 

He started to protest but she cut 
him short with a graceful but un- 
mistakable wave of the hand. He 
gave up. 

They sat at a table. 

A’gentur-E-ikasus waited for his 
combination monkey and bird lunch. 
Rod saw an old robot, dressed in 
a prehistoric tuxedo jacket, ask a 
question of the bear-man, leave one 
tray and bring another tray to him. 
The robot whipped off a freshly 
starched napkin. There was the most 
beautiful lunch which Rod McBan 
h#d ever seen. Even at a state ban- 
quet, the Old North Australians 
did not feed their guests like that. 

Just as they were finishing, the 
bear-cashier came to the table and 
asked, “Your name, cat-madam? I 
will charge these lunches to the 
government.” 

“C’mell, servant to Teadrinker, 
subject to the Lord Jestocost, a 
Chief of the Instrumentality.” 

The bear’s face had been epilated, 
so that they could see him pale. 

“C’mell,” he whispered. “C’mell! 
Forgive me, my lady. I have never 
seen you before. You have blessed 
this place. You have blessed my 
life. You are the friend of all 
underpeople. Go in peace.” 

C’mell gave him the bow and 
smile which a reigning empress 
might give to an active Lord of the 
Instrumentality. She started to pick 
up the monkey but he scampered 
on ahead of her. Rod was puzzled. 
As the bear-man bowed him out, 

THE STORE OF HEART'S DESIRE 



he asked, “C’mell. You are famous?” 
“In a way,” she said. “Only 
among the underpeople.”* She hur- 
ried them both toward a ramp. They 
reached daylight at last, but even 
before they came to the surface, 
Rod’s nose was assaulted by a riot 
of smells — foods frying, cakes 
baking, liquor spilling its pungency 
on the air, perfumes fighting with 
each other for attention and, above 
all, the smell of old things: dusty 
treasures, old leathers, tapestries, the 
echo-smells of people who had died 
a long time ago. 

C ’mell stopped and watched him. 

“You’re smelling things again? 
I must say, you have a better nose 
than any human being I ever met 
before. How does it smell to you?” 
“Wonderful,” he gasped. “Won- 
derful. Like all the treasures of the 
universe spilled out into one little 
place.” 

“It’s just the Thieves’ Market of 
Paris.” 

“There are thieves on Earth? Open 
ones, like Viola Siderea?” 

“Oh no,” she laughed. “They 
would die in a few days. The In- 
strumentality would catch them. 
These are just people, playing. The 
Rediscovery of Man found some old 
institutions, and an old market was 
one of them. They make the robots 
and underpeople find things for 
them and then they pretend to be 
ancient, and make bargains with each 
other. Or they cook food. Not many 
real people ever cook food these

days. It’s so funny that it tastes good 
to them. They all pick up money 
on their way in. They have barrels 
of it at the gate. In the evening, 
or when they leave, they usually 
throw the money in the gutter, even 
though they should really put it 
back in the barrel. It’s not money 
we underpeople could use. We go 
by numbers and computer cards,” 
she sighed. “I could certainly use 
some of that extra money.” 

“And underpeople like you — 
like us — ” said Rod, "what do we 
do in the market?” 

“Nothing,” she whispered. “Ab- 
solutely nothing. We can walk 
through if we are not too big and 
not too small and not too dirty and 
not too smelly. And even if we are 
all right, we must walk right through 
without looking directly at the real 
people and without touching any- 
thing in the market.” 

“Suppose we do?” asked Rod de- 
fiantly. 

“The robot police are there, with 
orders to kill on sight when they 
observe an infraction. Don’t yoh 
realize, C'rod,” she sobbed at him, 
“that there are millions of us in 
tanks, way below in Downdeep- 
downdeep, ready to be born, to be 
trained, to be sent up here to serve 
Man? We’re not scarce at all, C'rod, 
we’re not scarce at all!” 

“Why are we going through the 
market, then?” 

“It’s the only way to the Cat- 
master’s store. We’ll be tagged. 
Come along.” 

Where the ramp reached the sur- 
face, four bright-eyed robots, the 
blue-enamel bodies shining and their 

86 



milky eyes glowing, stood at the 
ready. Their weapons had an ugly 
buzz to them and were obviously al- 
ready off the “safety” mark. 

C’mell talked to them quietly and 
submissively. When the robot-ser- 
geant led her to a desk, she stared 
into an instrument like binoculars 
and blinked when she took her eyes 
away. She put her palm on a desk. 
The identification was completed. 
The robot sergeant handed her three 
bright disks, like saucers, each with 
a chain attached. Wordlessly she 
hung them around her own neck, 
Rod’s neck, and A’gentur’s. The ro- 
bots let them pass. They walked in 
demure single file through the place 
of beautiful sights and smells. 

Rod felt that his eyes were wet 
with tears of rage; “I’ll buy this 
place,” he thought to himself, “if 
it’s the only thing I'll ever buy!” 

C'mell had stopped walking. 

He looked up, very carefully. 

There was the sign: THE DE- 
PARTMENT STORE OF HEARTS’ 
DESIRES. 

A door opened. A wise old cat- 
person face looked out, stared at 
them, snapped, “No underpeople!” 
and slammed the door. C'mell rang 
the doorbell a second time. The face 
reappeared, more puzzled than an- 
gry. 

“Business,” she whispered, “of 
the Aitch Eye.” 

The face said, “In. Quick!” 

Ill 

O nce inside, Rod realized that 
the store was as rich as the 
market. There were no other cus- 



IP 





tomers. After the outside sounds of 
music, laughter, frying, boiling, 
things falling, dishes clattering, peo- 
ple arguing and the low undertone 
of the ever-ready robot weapons 
buzzing, the quietness of the room 
was itself a luxury, like old, heavy 
velvet. The smells were no less 
variegated than those on the out- 
side. But they were different, more 
complicated, and many more of 
them were completely unidentifi- 
able. 

One smell he was sure of: human 
fear. It had been in this room not 
long before. 

“Quick,” said the old cat-man. 
“I’m in trouble if you don’t get 
out of my store soon. What it your 
business?” 

“I’m C’mell,” said C’mell. 

He nodded pleasantly, but show- 
ed no sign of recognition. “I forget 
people,” he said. 

“This is A’gentur.” She indicated 
the monkey. 

The old cat-man did not even 
look at the animal. 

C’mell persisted, a note of tri- 
umph coming into her voice: You 

may have heard of him under his 
real name, E-ikasus.” 

The old man stood there, blink- 
ing, as though he were taking it 
in. “Yeekasoose? With the letter E?” 

“Transformed,” said C’mell in- 
exorably, “for a trip all the way 
to Old North Australia and back.” 

“Is this true?” said the old man 
to the monkey. 

E-ikasus said calmly, “I am the 
son of him of whom you think.” 

The old man dropped to his 
knees, but did so with dignity: “I

salute you, E-ikasus. When you 
next think-with your father, give 
him my greetings and ask from 
him his blessing. I am CWilliam, 
the Catmaster.” 

“You are famous,” said E-ikasus 
tranquilly. 

“But you are still in danger, 
merely being here. I have no license 
for underpeople!” 

C’mell produced her trump. “Cat- 
master, your next guest is no c’man. 
He is a true man, an offworlder, and 
he has just bought most of the 
planet Earth.” 

C’William looked at Rod with 
more than ordinary shrewdness. 
There was a touch of kindness in 
his attitude. He was tall for a 
cat-man; few animal features were 
left to him, because old age, which 
reduces racial and sexual contrasts 
to mere memories, had wrinkled 
him into a uniform beige. His hair 
was not white, but beige too; his 
few cat-whiskers looked old and 
worn. He was garbed in a fantastic 
costume which — Rod later learn- 
ed — consisted of the court robes 
of one of the Original Emperors, 
a dynasty which had prevailed many 
centuries among the further stars. 
Age was upon him, but wisdom was 
too: the habits of life, in his case, 
had been cleverness and kindness, 
themselves unusual in combination. 
Now very old, he was reaping the 
harvest of his years. He had done 
well with the thousands upon thou- 
sands of days behind him, with the 
result that age had brought a curious 
joy into his manner, as though each 
experience meant one more treat 
before the long bleak dark closed 



in. Rod felt himself attracted to 
this strange creature, who looked 
at him with such penetrating and 
very personal curiosity, and who 
managed to do so without giving 
offense. 

The catmaster spoke in very pass- 
able Norstrilian: “I know what you 
are thinking, mister and owner Mc- 
Ban.” 

“You can hier me?” cried Rod. 

“Not your thoughts. Your face. 
It reads easily. I am sure that I 
can help you.” 

“What makes you think I need 
help?” 

“All things need help,” said the 
old c’man briskly, “but we must get 
rid of our other guests first. Where 
do you want to go, excellent one? 
And you, cat-madam?” 

“Home,” said E-ikasus. He was 
tired and cross again. After speak- 
ing brusquely, he felt the need to 
make his tone more civil. “This 
body suits me badly, catmaster.” 

“Are you good at falling?” said 
the catmaster. “Free fall?” 

The monkey grinned. “With this 
body? Of course. Excellent.” 

“Fine,” said the catmaster, “you 
can drop down my waste chute. 
It falls next to the forgotten palace 
where the great wings beat against 
time.” 

The catmaster stepped to one side 
of the room. With only a nod at 
C’mell and Rod and a brief, “See 
you later,” the monkey watched as 
the catsmaster opened a manhole 
cover, leaped trustingly into the 
complete black depth which appear- 
ed and was gone. The catmaster re- 
placed the cover carefully.

H e turned to Cornell She faced 
him truculently, the defiance of 
her posture oddly at variance with 
the innocent voluptuousness of her 
young female body. “I’m going no- 
where.” 

“You’ll die,” said the catmaster. 
“Can’t you hear their weapons buzz- 
ing just outside the door? You know 
what they do to us underpeople. 
Especially to us cats. They use us, 
but do they trust us?” 

“I know one who does,” she said. 
“The Lord Jestocost could protect 
me, even here, just as he protects 
you, far beyond your limit of years.” 
“Don’t argue it. You will make 
trouble for him with the other real 
people. Here, girl, I will give you 
a tray to carry with a dummy pack- 
age on it. Go back to the under- 
ground and rest in the commissary 
of the bear-man. I will send Rod to 
you when we are through.” 

“Yes,” she said hotly, “but will 
you send him alive or dead?” 

The catmaster rolled his yellow 
eyes over Rod. “Alive,” he said. 
“This one — alive. I have predicted. 
Did you ever know me to be wrong? 
Come on, girl, out the door with 
you.” 

C’mell let herself be handed a 
tray and a package, taken seemingly 
at random. As she left Rod thought 
of her with quick affection. She 
was his closest link with earth. He 
blurted out, “C’mell, will you be 
all right.” 

She turned around at the door 
itself, looking all woman and all 
cat. Her red wild hair gleamed like 
a hearth-fire against the open light 
from the doorway. She stood erect, 

THE STORE OF HEARTS DESIRE 



as though she were a citizen of 
Earth and not a mere underperson 
or girlygirl. She held out her right 
hand clearly and commandingty 
while balancing the tray on her 
left hand. When he shook hands 
with her, Rod realized that her hand 
felt utterly human but very strong. 
With scarcely a break in her voice 
she said, “Rod, goodbye. I’m taking 
a chance with you, but if s the best 
chance I’ve ever taken. You can 
trust the Catmaster, here in the de- 
partment store of hearts’ desires. He 
does strange things, Rod, but they’re 
good strange things.” 

He released her hand and she 
left. C’William closed the door be- 
hind her. The room became hushed. 

“Sit down for a minute while I 
get ready. Or look around.” 

“Sir catmaster — ” said Rod. 

“No title, please. I am an under- 
person, made out of cats. You may 
call me C’William.” 

“C’William, please tell me first. 
I miss C’mell. I’m worried about 
her. Am I falling in love with her? 
Is that what falling in love means?” 
“She’s your wife,” said the cat- 
master. “Just temporarily and just 
in pretense, but she’s still your wife. 
It’s Earthlike to worry about one’s 
mate. She’s all right.” 

The old c’man disappeared be- 
hind a door which had an odd sign 
on it: HATE HALL. 

Rod looked around. 

The very first thing he saw was 
a display cabinet full of postage 
stamps. It was made of glass, but 
he could see the soft blues and the 
inimitable warm brick reds of his 
Cape of Good Hope triangular post- 

99 




age stamps. He had come to earth 
and there they were! He peered 
through the glass at them. They 
were even better than the illustra- 
tions which he had seen back on 
Norstrilia. They had the temper of 
great age upon them and yet, some- 
how, they seemed to freight with 
them the love which men, living 
men now dead, had given them for 
thousands and thousands of years. 
He looked around, and saw that the 
whole room was full of odd riches. 
There were ancient toys of all per- 
iods, flying toys, copies of machines, 
things which he suspected were 
trains. There was a two-story clo- 
set of clothing, shimmering with 
embroidery and gleaming with 
gold. There was a bin of weapons, 
clean and tidy — models so ancient 
that he could not possibly guess 
what they had been used for, or by 
whom. Everywhere, there were 
buckets of coins, usually gold ones. 
He picked up a handful. They had 
languages he could not even guess 
at and they showed the proud im- 
perious faces of the ancient dead. 
Another cabinet was one which he 
glanced at and then turned away 
from, shocked and yet inquisitive; it 
was filled with indecent souvenirs 
and pictures from a hundred per- 
iods of men’s history, images, 
sketches, photographs, dolls and 
models, all of them portraying gris- 
ly, comical, sweet, friendly, impres- 
sive or horrible versions of the 
many acts of love. The next section 
made him pause utterly. Who would 
have ever wanted these things? 
Whips, knives, hoods, leather cor- 
sets. He passed on, very puzzled. 



T here was a slight sound. Rod 
turned around to face the Cat- 
master. 

“You like my poems? You like 
my things? I like them myself. Many 
men come in here to take things 
from me, but they find that title 
is vested in the Lord Jestocost, and 
they must do strange things to 
obtain my trifles.” 

“Are all these things genuine?" 
asked Rod, thinking that even Old 
North Australia could not buy out 
this shop if they were. 

“Certainly not,” said the old 
man. “Most of them are wonderful 
forgeries. The Instrumentality lets 
me go to the robot-pits where insane 
or worn-out robots are destroyed. I 
can have my pick of them if they 
are not dangerous. I put them to 
work making copies of anything 
which I find in the museums.” 
“Those Cape triangles?” said Rod. 
“Are they real?” 

“Cape triangles? You mean the 
letter stickers. They are genuine, all 
right, but they are not mine. Those 
are on loan from the Earth museum 
until I can get them copied.” 

“I will buy them,” said Rod. 
“You will not,” said the cat- 
master. “They are not for sale.” 
“Then I will buy Earth and you 
and them too,” said Rod. 

“Roderick Frederick Ronald Ar- 
nold William MacArthur McBan to 
the one hundred and fifty-first, you 
will not.” 

“Who are you to tell me?” 

“I have looked at one person and 
I have talked to two others.” 

“All right,” said Rod. “Who?” 

“I looked at the other Rod Mc-

Ban, your workman, Eleanor. She 
is a little mixed up about having a 
young man’s body, because she is 
very drunk in the home of the Lord 
William Not-from-here and a beau- 
tiful young woman named Ruth 
Not-from-here is trying to make 
Eleanor marry her. She has no idea 
that she is dealing with another 
woman and Eleanor, in her copy of 
your proper body, is finding the 
experience exciting but terribly con- 
fusing. No harm will come of it, 
and your Eleanor is perfectly safe. 
Half the rascals of Earth have con- 
verged on the Lord William’s house, 
but he has a whole battalion from 
the Defense Fleet on loan around 
the place. So nothing is going to 
happen — except that Eleanor will 
have a headache and Ruth will have 
a disappointment.” 

Rod smiled. “You couldn’t have 
told me anything better. Who else 
did you talk to?” 

“The Lord Jestocost and John 
Fisher to the hundredth.” 

“Mister and owner Fisher? He’s 
here?” 

“He’s at his home, station of the 
Good Fresh Joey. I asked him if 
you could have your heart’s desire. 
After a little while, he and some- 
body named doctor Wentworth said 
that the Commonwealth of Old 
North Australia would approve it.” 
“How did you ever pay for such 
a call?” cried Rod. “Those things 
are frightfully expensive.” 

“I didn’t pay for it, mister and 
owner. You did. I charged it to 
your account, by the authority of 
your trustee, the Lord Jestocost. He 
and his forefathers have been my 



patrons for four hundred and twen- 
ty-six years.” 

“You’ve got your nerve,” said 
Rod, “spending my money when I 
was right here and not even asking 
me!” 

“You are an adult for some pur- 
poses and a minor for other pur- 
poses. I am offering you the skills 
which keep me alive. Do you think 
any ordinary cat-man would be 
allowed to live as long as this?” 
“No,” said Rod. “Give me those 
stamps and let me go.” 

The catmaster looked at him le- 
velly. Once again there was the per- 
sonal look on his face, which in 
Norstrilia would have been taken 
as an unpardonable affront; but 
along with the nosiness, there was 
an air of confidence and kindness 
which put Rod a little in awe of 
the man, underperson though he 
was. “Do you think that you could 
love these stamps when you get back 
home? Could they talk to you? 
Could they make you like yourself? 
Those pieces of paper are not your 
heart’s desire. Something else is.” 
“What?” said Rod, truculently. 

“In a bit, I’ll explain. First, you 
cannot kill me. Second, you cannot 
hurt me. Third, if I kill you, it 
will be all for your own good. 
Fourth, if you get out of here, you 
will be a very happy man.” 

“Are you barmy, mister?” cried 
Rod. “I can knock you flat and 
walk out that door. I don’t know 
what you are talking about.” 

“Try it,” said the catmaster level- 

iy- 

Rod looked at the tall withered 
old man* with the bright eyes. He

looked at the door, a mere seven 
or eight meters away. He did not 
want to try it 

“All right.” he conceded, “play 
your pitch.” 

“I am a clinical psychologist. The 
only one on Earth and probably 
the only one on any planet. I got 
my knowledge from some ancient 
books when I was a kitten, being 
changed into a young man. I change 
people just a little, little bit. You 
know that the Instrumentality has 
surgeons and brain experts and all 
sorts of doctors. They can do almost 
anything with personality but the 
light stuff. That I do.” 

“I don’t get it,” said Rod. 

“Would you go to a brain sur- 
geon to get a haircut? Would you 
need a dermatologist to give you 
a bath? Of course not. I don’t do 
heavy work. I just change people 
a little bit. It makes them happy. 
If I can’t do anything with them, I 
give them souvenirs from this junk- 
pile out here. The real work is in 
there. That’s where you’re going, 
pretty soon.” He nodded his head 
at the door marked HATE HALL. 

IV 

R od was not a coward, but it 
was with feet and legs of lead 
that he walked to the door. It opened 
by itself. He walked in, steady but 
afraid. 

The room was dark with a dark- 
ness deeper than mere black. It 
was the dark of blindness, the ex- 
panse of cheek where no eye has 
ever been. 

The door closed behind him and 



he swam in the dark, so tangible 
had the darkness become. 

He felt blind. He felt as though 
he had never seen. 

But he could hear. 

He heard his own blood pulsing 
through his head. 

He could smell — indeed, he 
was good at smelling. And this air 
— this air smelled of the open night 
of Old North Australia. 

The smell made him feel little 
and afraid. It reminded him of his 
repeated childhoods, of the artificial 
drownings in the laboratories where 
he had gone to be re-born from one 
childhood to another. 

He reached out his hands. 

Nothing. 

He jumped gently. No ceiling. 

Using a fieldsman’s trick familiar 
from times of dust-storms, he drop- 
ped lightly to his hands and feet. 
He scuttled crabwise on two feet 
and one hand, using the other hand 
as a shield to protect his face. In 
a very few meters he found the 
wall. He followed the wall around. 

Circular. 

This was the door. 

Follow again. 

With more confidence, he moved 
fast. Around, around, around. He 
could not tell whether the floor 
was asphalt or some kind of rough 
worn tile. 

Door again. 

A voice spieked to him. 

Spieked! And he heard it . 

He looked upward into the noth- 
ing which was bleaker than blind- 
ness, almost expecting to see the 
words in letters of fire, so clear 
had they been. 



92 



IF 




The voice was Norstrilian and it 
said, Rod McBan is a man , man , 
man. But what is man? 

Immediate percussion of crazy , 
sad laughter . 

Rod never noticed that he re- 
verted to the habits of babyhood. 
He sat flat on his rump, legs spread 
out in front of him at a 90° angle. 
He put his hands a little behind him 
and leaned back, letting the weight 
of his body push his shoulders a 
little bit upward. He knew the ideas 
that would follow the words, but he 
never knew why he so readily ex- 
pected them. 

Light formed in the room, as he 
had been sure it would. 

T he images were little, but they 
looked real. 

Men and women and children, 
children and women and men 
marched into his vision and out 
again. 

They were not freaks. They were 
not beasts. They were not alien 
monstrosities begotten in some out- 
side universe. They were not ro- 
bots. They were not underpeople. 
They were all hominids like him- 
self, kinsmen in the Earthborn races 
of men. 

First came people like Old North 
Australians and Earth people, very 
much alike, and both similar to 
the ancient types, except that Nor- 
strilians were pale beneath their 
tanned skins and more robust. 

Then came Daimoni, white-eyed 
pale giants with a magical assurance, 
whose very babies walked as though 
they had already been given ballet 
lessons. 



Then heavy men, fathers, moth- 
ers, infants swimming on the solid 
ground from which they would nev- 
er arise. 

Then rainmen from Amazonas 
Triste, their skins hanging in enor- 
mous folds around them, so that 
they looked like bundles of wet 
rags wrapped around monkeys. 

Blind men from Olympia, staring 
fiercely at the world through the 
radars mounted on their foreheads. 

Bloated monster-men from aban- 
doned planets — - people as bad off 
as his own race had been after es- 
caping from Paradise VII. 

And still more races. 

People he had never heard of. 

Men with shells. 

Men and women so thin that they 
looked like insects. 

A race of smiling, foolish giants, 
lost in the irreparable hebephrenia 
of their world. (Rod had the feeling 
that they were shepherded by a race 
of devoted dogs, more intelligent 
than themselves, who cajoled them 
into breeding, begged them to eat, 
led them to sleep. He saw no dogs, 
only the smiling unfocused fools, 
but the feeling dog, good dog! was 
somehow very near.) 

A funny little people who pranc- 
ed with an indefinable deformity 
of gait. 

Water-people, the clean water of 
some unidentified world pulsing 
through their gills. 

And then — 

More people, still, but hostile 
ones. Lipsticked hermaphrodites with 
enormous beards and fluting voices. 
Carcinomas which had taken over 
men. Giants rooted in the earth. 



THE STORE OF HEART'S DESIRE 



91 




Human bodies crawling and weep- 
ing as they crept through wet grass, 
contaminated themselves and look- 
ing for more people to infect. 

Rod did not know it, but he 
growled. 

He jumped into a squatting po- 
sition and swept his hands across 
the rough floor, looking for a 
weapon. 

These were not men — they were 
enemies! 

Still they came. People who had 
lost eyes, or who had grown fire- 
resistant, the wrecks and residues of 
abandoned settlements and forgot- 
ten colonies. The waste and spoilage 
of the human race. 

And then — 

Him. 

Himself. 

The child Rod McBan. 

And voices, Norstrilian voices 
calling: “He can’t hier. He can’t 
spiek. He’s a freak. He’s a freak! 
He can’t hier. He can’t spiek.” 

And another voice: “His poor 
parents!” 

The child Rod disappeared and 
there were his parents again. Twelve 
times taller than life, so high that 
he had to peer up into the black 
absorptive ceiling to see the under- 
side of their faces. 

The mother wept. 

The father sounded stern. 

The father was saying, “It’s no 
use. Doris can watch him while 
we’re gone, but if he isn’t any bet- 
ter, we’ll turn him in.” 

“Kill him?” shrieked the woman. 
“Kill my baby? Oh, no! No!” 

The calm, loving, horrible voice 
of the man. “Darling, spiek to him 



yourself. He’ll never hier. Can that 
be a Rod McBan?” 

Then the woman’s voice, sweet- 
poisonous and worse than death, 
sobbing agreement with her man 
against her son. 

“I don’t know, Rod. I don’t know. 
Just don’t tell me about it.” 

He had hiered them, in one of his 
moments of wild penetrating hiering 
when everything telepathic came in 
with startling clarity. He had hiered 
them when he was a baby. 

The real Rod in the dark room 
let out a roar of fear, desolation, 
loneliness, rage, hate. This was the 
telepathic bomb with which he had 
so often startled or alarmed the 
neighbors. 

B ut this time, the room was clos- 
ed. His mind roared back at 
itself. 

Rage, loudness, hate, raw noise 
poured into him from the floor, the 
circular wall, the high ceiling. 

He cringed beneath it and as 
he cringed, the sizes of the images 
changed. His parents sat in chairs, 
chairs. They were little, little. He 
was an almighty baby, so enormous 
that he could scoop them up with 
his hand. 

He reached the tiny loathesome 
parents who had said, “Let him 
die.” 

To crush them, but they faded 
first. 

Their faces turned frightened. 
They looked wildly around. Their 
chairs dissolved, the fabric falling 
to a floor which in turn looked like 
storm-eroded cloth. They turned for 
a last kiss and had no lips. They 



94 



IF 




reached to hug each other and their 
arms fell off. Their space ship had 
gone milky in mid-trip, dissolving 
into traceless nothing. And he, him- 
self had seen it! 

The rage was followed by tears, 
by a guilt too deep for regret, by 
a self-accusation so raw and wet 
that it lived like one more organ 
inside his living body. 

He wanted nothing. 

No money, no stroon, no Station 
of Doom. He wanted no friends, no 
companionship, no welcome, no 
house, no food. He wanted no walks, 
no solitary discoveries in the field, 
no friendly sheep, no treasures in the 
gap, no computer, no day, no night, 
no life. 

He wanted nothing, and he could 
not understand death. 

The enormous room lost all light 
and all sound, and he did not notice 
it. His own naked life lay before 
him like a freshly dissected cadaver. 
It lay there and it made no sense. 
There had been many Roderick 
Frederick Ronald Arnold William 
MacArthur McBans, one hundred 
and fifty of them in a room, but he 
— 151! 151! — was not one of 
them, not a giant who had wrestled 
treasure from the sick earth and 
hidden sunshine of the Norstrilian 
plains. It wasn’t his telepathic de- 
formity, his spieklessness, his brain- 
deafness to hiering. It was himself, 
the “me-subtile” inside him, which 
was all wrong. He was the baby 
worth killing, who had killed in- 
stead. He had hated mama and 
papa for their pride and their hate: 
when he hated them, they crumpled 
and died out in the mystery of 



space, so that they did not even 
leave bodies to bury. 

Rod stood to his feet. His hands 
were wet. He touched his face and 
he realized that he had been weep- 
ing with his face cupped in his 
hands. 

Wait. 

There was something that still re- 
mained. 

There was one thing that he want- 
ed, and he wanted it from his one 
enemy. He wanted Houghton Syme 
not to hate him. Houghton could 
hier and spiek, but he was a shortie, 
living with the sickness of death 
lying between himself and every 
girl, every friend, every job he had 
met. And he, Rod, had mocked 
that man, calling him Old Hot and 
Simple. 

Rod might be worthless but 
he was not as bad off as 
Houghton Syme, the Hon. Sec. 
Houghton Syme was at least 
trying to be a man, to live his 
miserable scrap of a life, and all 
Rod had ever done was to flaunt 
his wealth and near-immortality be- 
fore the poor cripple who had just 
one hundred and sixty years to live. 
Rod wanted only one thing — to 
get back to Old North Australia 
in time to help Houghton Syme, to 
let Houghton Syme know that the 
guilt was his, Rod’s, and not Syme’s. 
The Onseck had a bit of a life and 
he deserved the best that he could 
make of it. 

Rod stood there, expecting noth- 
ing. 

He had forgiven his last and worst 
enemy. 

He had forgiven himself.

T he door opened very matter-of- 
factly and there stood the Cat- 
master, a quiet, wise smile upon his 
face. 

“You can come out now, Mister 
and owner McBan, and if there is 
anything in this outer room which 
you want, you may certainly have 
it.” 

Rod walked out slowly. He had 
no idea how long he had been in 
HATE HALL. 

When he emerged, the door 
closed behind him. 

“No thanks, cobber. It’s mighty 
friendly of you, but I don’t need 
anything much, and I’d better be 
getting back to my own planet.” 
“Nothing?” said the Catmaster, 
still smiling very attentively and 
very quietly. 

“I’d like to hier and spiek but 
it’s not very important.” 

“This is for you,” said the Cat- 
master. “You put it in your ear 
and leave it there. If it itches or 
gets dirty, you take it out, wash it, 
and put it back in. It’s not a rare 
device, but apparently you don’t 
have them on your planet.” He held 
out an object no larger than the 
kernel of a ground-nut. 

Rod took it absently and was 
ready to put it into his pocket, not 
into his ear, when he saw that the 
smiling attentive face was watching, 
very gently but very alertly. He put 
the device' into his ear. It felt a 
little cold. 

“I will now,” said the Catmaster, 
“take you to C’mell, who will lead 
you to your friends in Downdeep- 
downdeep. You had better take 
this blue two-penny Cape of Good 



Hope postage stamp with you. I 
will report to Jestocost that it was 
lost while I attempted to copy it. 
That is slightly true, isn’t it?” 

Rod started to thank him absent- 
mindedly and then — 

Then, with a thrill which sent 
gooseflesh all over his neck, back 
and arms, he realized that the Cat- 
master had not moved his lips in 
the slightest, had not pushed air 
through his throat, had not disturbed 
the air with the pressure of noise. 
The Catmaster had spieked to Rod 
and Rod had hiered him. 

V 

R od McBan left the Department 
Store of Hearts’ Desires simply, 
humbly. He carried a package of 
books, wrapped in dustproofing pa- 
per, and he looked like any other 
first-class cat-man messenger. 

The human beings in the market 
were still making their uproar, their 
smells of foods, spices, and odd ob- 
jects, but he walked so calmly and 
so straightforwardly through their 
scattered groups that even the robot 
police, weapons on the buzz, paid 
no attention to him. 

When he had come across the 
Thieves’ Market, going the other 
way with C’mell and A’gentur, he 
had been ill at ease. As a mister- 
and-owner from Old North Aus- 
tralia, he had been compelled to 
keep his external dignity, but he 
had not felt ease within his heart. 
These people were strange. His de- 
stination had been unfamiliar, and 
the problems of wealth and survi- 
val lay heavy upon him. 



96 



IF 




Now, it was all different. Cat- 
man he might be on the outside, 
but on the inside he once again 
felt his proper pride of home and 
planet. 

And more. 

He felt calm, down to the very 
tips of his nerve endings. 

The hiering-spieking device should 
have alerted and excited him: it 
did not. As he walked through the 
market, he noticed that very few 
of the Earth people were communi- 
cating with one another telepathi- 
cally. They preferred to babble in 
their loud airborne language, of 
which they had not one but many 
kinds, with the old Common Tongue 
serving as a referent for those who 
had been endowed with different 
kinds of ancient language by the 
processes of the Rediscovery of 
Man. He had even heard Ancient 
Inglish, the Queen’s Own Language, 
sounding remarkably close to his 
own spoken language of Norstrilian. 
These things caused neither stimu- 
lation nor excitement, not even pity. 
He had his own problems, but they 
were no longer the problems of 
wealth or of survival. Somehow he 
had a confidence that a hidden, 
friendly power in the universe would 
take care of him, if he took care 
of others. He wanted to get Eleanor 
out of trouble, to disembarrass the 
Hon. Sec., to see Lavinia, to re- 
assure Doris, to say goodbye to 
C’mell, to get back to his sheep, 
to protect his computer and to 
keep the Lord Redlady away from 
his bad habit of killing other people 
lawfully on occasions too slight for 
manslaughter. 



One of the robot police, a little 
more perceptive than the others, 
watched this cat-man who walked 
with preternatural assurance through 
the crowds of men, but “C’roderick” 
did nothing but enter the market 
from one side, thread his way 
through it and leave at the other 
side, still carrying his package. The 
robot turned away. His dreadful, 
milky eyes, always ready for dis- 
order and death, scanned the mar- 
ket place again and again with 
fatigue-free vigilance. 

Rod went down the ramp and 
turned right. 

There was the underpeople com- 
missary with the bear-man cashier. 
The cashier remembered him. 

“It’s been a long day, cat-sir, since 
I saw you. Would you like another 
special order of fish?” 

“Where’s my girl?” said Rod 
bluntly. 

“C’mell?” said the bear-cashier. 
“She waited here a long time but 
then she went on and she left this 
message, Tell my man C’Rod that 
he should eat before following me, 
but that when he has eaten he can 
either follow me by going to Up- 
shaft Four, Ground Level Hostd 
of the Singing Birds, Room Nine, 
where I am taking care of an off- 
world visitor, or he can send a robot 
to me and I will come to him.’ 
Don’t you think, cat-sir, that I’ve 
done well, remembering so compli- 
cated a message?” The bear-man 
flushed a little and the edge went 
off his pride as he confessed, for 
the sake of some abstract honesty, 
“Of course, that address part, I 
wrote that down. It would be very 



THE STORE OF HEARTS DESIRE 



97 




bad and very confusing if I sent 
you to the wrong address in peo- 
ple’s country. Somebody might bum 
you down if you came into an un- 
authorized corridor.” 

“Fish, then,” said Rod. “A fish 
dinner, please.” 

H e wondered why Cmell, with 
his life in the balance, would 
go off to another visitor. Even as he 
thought this, he detected the mean 
jealousy behind it, and he confessed 
to himself that he had no idea of 
the terms, conditions, or hours of 
work required in the girlygirl busi- 
ness. 

He sat dully on the bench, wait- 
ing for his food. 

The uproar of HATE HALL was 
still in his mind, the pathos of his 
parents, those dying dissolving 
mannikins, was bright within his 
heart, and his body throbbed with 
the fatigue of the ordeal. Idly he 
asked the bear-cashier, “How long 
has it been since I was here?” 

The bear-cashier looked at the 
clock on the wall, “About fourteen 
hours, worthy cat.” 

“How long is that in real time?” 
Rod was trying to compare Nor- 
strilian hours with Earth hours. He 
thought that Earth hours were one- 
seventh shorter, but he was not 
sure. 

The bear-man was completely 
baffled. “If you mean galactic navi- 
gation time, dear guest, we never 
use that down here anyhow. Are 
there any other kinds of time?” 
Rod realized his mistake and tried 
to correct it. “It doesn’t matter. I 
am thirsty. What is lawful for un- 



derpeople to drink? I am tired and 
thirsty, both, but I have no desird 
to become the least bit drunk.” 
“Since you are a c’man,” said 
the bear-cashier, “I recommend 
strong black coffee mixed with 
sweet whipped cream.” 

“I have no money,” said Rod. 
‘The famous cat-madam, C*meH 
your consort, has guaranteed pay- 
ment for anything at all that you 
order.” 

“Go ahead, then.” 

The bear-man called a robot over 
and gave him the orders. 

Rod stared at the wall, wonder- 
ing what he was going to do with 
this Earth he had bought. He wasn’t 
thinking very hard, just musing 
idly. A voice cot directly into his 
mind. He realized that the bear-man 
was spieking to him and that he 
could hear it. 

“You are not an underman, sir 
and master.” 

“What?” spieked Rod. 

“You heard me,” said the tele- 
pathic voice. ”1 am not going to 
repeat it. If you come in the sign 
of the Fish, may blessings be upon 
you.” 

T don’t know that sign,” said 
Rod. 

“Then,” spieked the bear-man, 
“no matter who you are, may you 
eat and drink in peace because you 
are a friend of Cornell and you are 
under the protection of the One 
Who Lives in Downdeep.” 

“I don’t know,” spieked Rod. “I 
just don’t know, but I thank you 
for your welcome, friend.” 

“I do not give such welcomes 
Kghtly,” said the bear-man, “and 



98 



IF 




ordinarily I would be ready to ran 
away from anything at dangerous 
and unexplained as yourself, but 
you bring with you the quality of 
peace, which made me think that 
you might travel in the fellowship 
of the sign of the Fish. I have 
heard that in that sign, people and 
underpeople remember die bless- 
ed Joan and mingle in complete 
comradeship." 

“No,” said Rod, “no. I travel 
alone.” 

His food and drink came. He 
consumed them quietly. The bear- 
cashier had given him a table ami 
bench far from the serving tables 
and away from the other underpeo- 
ple who dropped in, interrupting 
their tasks, eating in a hurry so 
that they could get back in a hurry. 
He saw one wolf-man, wearing the 
insigne of Auxiliary Police, who 
came to the wall, forced his identity- 
card into a dot, opened his mouth, 
bolted down five large chunks a f 
red, raw meat and left the com- 
missary, all in less than one and one- 
half minutes. Rod was amazed but 
not impressed. He had too much on 
his rnfrvi. 

At the desk he confirmed the 
address which Ctadl had left, of- 
fered the bearsman a handshake 
and went along to Upshaft Four. 
He still looked like a c’man and he 
carried his package alertly and htm- 
bly, as he had seen other under- 
people behave in the presence of 
real persons. 

H e almost met death on the 
way. 

Upshaft Four was one-directional 



and was plainly marked, “People 
Only.” Rod did not like the looks 
of it, as long as he moved in a 
cat-man body, but he did not think 
that Cmell would give him direc- 
tions wrongly or lightly. (Later, he 
found that she had forgotten to tell 
him the phrase, “Special business 
under the protection of Jetocost, 
a Chief of the Instrumentality, ” If 
he were to be challenged; but he 
did not know the phrase.) 

An arrogant human man, wear- 
ing a billowing red cloak, looked 
at him sharply as he took a belt, 
hooked it and stepped into the 
shaft When Rod stepped free, bd 
and the man were on a level. 

Rod tried to look like a humble, 
modest messenger, but the strange 
voice grated his ears: “Just what 
do you think you are doing? This 
is a human shaft." 

Rod pretended that he did not 
know it was himself whom the 
redcloaked man was addressing. He 
continued to float quietly upward, 
his magnet-belt tugging uncomfort- 
ably at his waist. 

A pain in foe ribs made him tuns 
suddenly, almost losing his balance! 
in foe belt 

“Animal!” cried foe man. “Speak 
up or die." 

Still holding his package of books. 
Rod said mildly, “Tm on an errand 
and I was told to go this way.” 

The man’s senseless hostility gave 
caliber to his voice: “And who 
told you?” 

“Cmell," said Rod absently. 

The man and his companions 
laughed at that, and for some rea- 
son their laughter had no humor 



THE STORE OF HEART'S DESIRE 



9P 




in it, just savagery, cruelty and — 
way down underneath — something 
of fear. “Listen to that!” said the 
man in a red cloak. “One animal 
says another animal told it to do 
something.” He whipped oat a 
knife. 

“What are you doing?” cried 
Rod. 

“Just cutting your belt,” said the 
man. “There’s nobody at all below 
us and you will make a nice red 
blob at the bottom of the shaft, 
cat-man. That ought to teach you 
which shaft to use.” 

The man actually reached over 
and seized Rod’s belt. 

He lifted the knife to slash. 

Rod became frightened and an- 
gry. His brain ran red. 

He spat thoughts at them — 
pommy! 
shortie! 

Earthie! 

dead red dirty blue stinking 
little man, 

die, puke, burst, blaze, die! 

It all came out in a single flash, 
faster than he could control it. The 
red-cloaked man twisted oddly, as 
if in spasm. His two companions 
threshed in their belts. They turned 
slowly. 

High above them, two women 
began screaming. 

Further up a man was shouting, 
both with his voice and with his 
mind, “Police! Help! Police! Police! 
Brainbomb! Brainbomb! Help!” 

The effort of his telepathic ex- 
plosion left Rod feeling disoriented 
and weak. He shook his head and 
blinked his eyes. He started to 
wipe his face, only to hit himself 



on the jaw with the package of 
books, which he still carried. This 
aroused him a little. He looked at 
the three men. 

Redcloak was dead, his head at 
an odd angle. The other two seem- 
ed to be dead. One was floating up- 
side down, his rump pointing up- 
most and the two limp legs swinging 
out at odd angles; the other was 
right-side up but had sagged in his 
belt. All three of them kept moving 
a steady ten meters a itainute, right 
along with Rod. 

There were strange sounds from 
above. 

An enormous voice, filling the 
shaft with its volume, roared down: 
“Stay where you are! Police. Police. 
Police.” 

R od glanced at the bodies float- 
ing upward. A corridor came 
by. He reached for the grip-bar, 
made it, and swung himself into the 
horizontal passage. He sat down 
immediately, not getting away from 
the Upshaft. He thought sharply 
with his new hiering. Excited, fran- 
tic minds beat all around him, look- 
ing for enemies, lunatics, crimes, 
aliens, anything strange. 

Softly he began spieking to the 
empty corridor and to himself, “I 
am a dumb cat. I am the messenger 
C’rod. I must take the books to the 
gentleman from the stars. I am a 
dumb cat. I do not know much.” 

A robot, gleaming with the or- 
namental body-armor of Old Earth, 
landed at his cross-corridor, looked 
at Rod and called up the shaft, 
“Master, here’s one. A c’man with 
a package.

IF 




A young subchief came into view, 
feet first as he managed to ride 
down the shaft instead of going up 
it. He seized the ceiling of the 
transverse corridor, gave himself a 
push and (once free of the shaft’s 
magnetism) dropped heavily on his 
feet beside Rod. Rod hiered him 
thinking, “Fm good at this. I’m a 
good telepath. I clean things up 
fast Look at this dumb cat.” 

Rod went on concentrating, “Fm 
a dumb cat. I have a package to 
deliver. Fm a dumb cat.” 

The subchief looked down at him 
scornfully. Rod felt the other’s mind 
slide over his own in the rough 
equivalent of a search. He remained 
relaxed and tried to feel stupid while 
the other hiered him. Rod said 
nothing. The subchief flashed his 
baton over the package, eying the 
crystal knob at the end. 

“Books,” he snorted. 

Rod nodded. 

“You!” said the bright young 
subchief. “You see bodies?” He 
spoke in a painfully clear, almost 
childish version of the Old Common 
Tongue. 

Rod held up three fingers and 
then pointed upward. 

“You, cat-man, you feel file 
brain-bomb!” 

Rod, beginning to enjoy the game, 
threw his head backward and let 
out a cattish yowl expressing pain. 
The subchief could not help clap- 
ping his hands over his ears. He 
started to turn away. “I can see 
what you think of it, cat fellow. 
You’re pretty stupid, aren’t you?” 

Still thinking low dull thoughts as 
evenly as he could, Rod said promp- 



tly and modestly, “Me smart cat. 
Very handsome, too.” 

“Come along,” said the subchief 
to his robot, disregarding Rod al- 
together. 

Rod plucked at his sleeve. 

The subchief turned back. 

Very humbly Rod said, “Sir and 
master, which way. Hostel of Sing- 
ing Birds, Room Nine?” 

“Mother of poodles!” cried the 
subchief. “Fm on a murder case 
and this dumb cat asks me for di- 
rections.” He was a decent young 
man and he thought for a minute. 
“This way — ” said he, pointing up 
the Upshaft — “it’s twenty mode 
meters and then the third street 
over. But that’s ‘people only.’ IF* 
about a kilometer over to the step* 
for animals.” He stood, frowning, 
and then swung on one of his ro- 
bots: “Wush\ you see this cat!” 

“Yes, master, a cat-man, very 
handsome.” 

“So you think he’s handsome, too. 
He already thinks so, so that makes 
it unanimous. He may be handsome, 
but he’s dumb. Wush’, take this 
cat-man to the address he tells you. 
Use the upshaft by my authority. 
Don’t put a belt on him, just hug 
him.” 

Rod was immeasurably grateful 
that he had slipped his shaftbelt off 
and had left it negligently on the 
rack, just before the robot arrived. 

The robot seized him around the 
waist with what was literally a grip 
of iron. They did not wait for the 
slow upward magnetic drive of file 
shaft to lift them. The robot had 
some kind of jet in his backpack 
and lifted Rod with sickening speed 



THE STORE OF HEART'S DESIRE 



101 




to the next level. He pushed Rod 
into the corridor and followed him. 

“Where do you go?” said the 
robot, very plainly. 

Rod, concentrating on feeling stu- 
pid just in case someone might still 
be trying to hier his mind, said 
slowly and stumblingly, “Hostel of 
the Singing Birds, Room Nine.” 

The robot stopped still, as though 
he were communicating telepathi- 
cally, but Rod’s mind, though alert, 
could catch not the faintest whisper 
of telepathic communication. “Hot 
buttered sheep!” thought Rod. “He’s 
using radio to check the address 
with his headquarters right from 
here!” 

VI 

W ush’ appeared to be doing just 
that. He came to in a mo- 
ment. They emerged under the sky, 
filled with Earth’s own moon, the 
loveliest thing that Rod had ever 
seen. He did not dare to stop and 
enjoy the scenery, but he trotted 
lithely beside the robot-policeman. 

They came down a road with 
heavy, scented flowers. The wet 
warm air of Earth spread the sweet- 
ness everywhere. 

On their right there was a court- 
yard with copies of ancient foun- 
tains, a dining space now complete- 
ly empty of diners, a robot waiter 
in the corner and many individual 
rooms opening on the plaza. The 
robot policeman called to the robot- 
waiter, “Where’s number nine?” 
The waiter answered him with a 
lifting of the hand and an odd twist 
af the wrist, twice repeated, which 



the robot-policeman seemed to un- 
derstand perfectly well. 

“Come along,” he said to Rod, 
leading the way to an outside stair- 
way which reached up to an out- 
side balcony serving the second 
story of rooms. One of the rooms 
had a plain number nine on it. 

Rod was about to tell the robot- 
policeman that he could see the 
number nine, when Wush’ with of- 
ficious kindness, took the doorknob 
and flung it open with a gesture of 
welcome to Rod. 

There was the great cough of a 
heavy gun and Wush’, his head 
blown almost completely off, clank- 
ed metallically to the iron floor of 
the balcony. Rod instinctively jump- 
ed for cover and flattened himself 
against the wall of the building. 

A handsome man, wearing what 
seemed to be a black suit, came 
into the doorway, a heavy-caliber 
police pistol in his hand. 

“Oh, there you are,” said he to 
Rod evenly enough. “Come on in.” 

Rod felt his legs working, felt 
himself walking into the room de- 
spite the effort of his mind to 
resist. He stopped pretending to be 
a dumb cat. He dropped the books 
on the ground and went back to 
thinking like his normal Old North 
Australian self, despite the cat body. 
It did no good. He kept on walking 
involuntarily, and entered the room. 

As he passed the man himself, he 
was conscious of a sticky sweet 
rotten smell, like nothing he had 
ever smelled before. He also saw 
that the man, though fully dothed, 
was sopping wet. 

He entered the room. 



102 



IT 




I t was raining inside. Somebody 
had jammed the fire-sprinkler 
system so that a steady rain fell 
from the ceiling to the floor. 

C’mell stood in the middle of 
the room, her glorious red hair a 
wet stringy mop hanging down her 
shoulders. There was a look of 
concentration and alarm on her 
face. 

“I," said the man, “am Tostig 
Amaral. This girl said that her hus- 
band would come with a policeman. 
I did not think she was right. But 
she was right. With the cat-husband 
(here comes a policeman. I shoot the 
policeman. He is a robot and I can 
pay the Earth government for as 
many robots as I like. You are a 
cat. I can kill you also, and pay 
die charges on you. But I am a nice 
man, and I want to make love with 
your little red art over there, so I 
will be generous and pay you some- 
dung to that you can tell her she 
is mine and not yours. Do you 
understand that, cat-man?" 

Rod found himself released from 
(he unexplained muscular bonds 
which had hampered his freedom. 

“My lord, my master from afar," 
he said, “Cmell is an underperson. 
It is the law here that if an under- 
person and a person become in- 
volved hi love, the underperson 
dies and the human person gets 
brainscrubbed. I am sure, my mas- 
ter, that you would not want to be 
brainscrubbed by the Earth authori- 
ties. Let the girl go." 

Amaral glided across the room. 
His face was pale, petulant, human, 
but Rod saw that the black clothes 
were not clothes at all. 

THE STORE OF HEART'S DeSIRI 



The “dothes” were mucous mem- 
branes, an extension of Amaral's 
living skin, 

The pale face turned even more 
pale with rage. 

“You’re a bold cat-man to talk 
like that. My body is bigger than 
yours, and it is poisonous as welL 
We have had to live hard in the 
rain of Amazonas Triste, and we 
have mental and physical powers 
which you had better not disturb. 
If you will not take payment, go 
away anyhow. The girl is mine. 
What happens to her is my business. 
If I violate Earth regulations, I will 
destroy the c’girl and pay for her. 
Go away, or you die." 

Rod spoke with deliberate calm 
and calculated risk. “Citizen, I 
play no game. I am not a cat-man 
but a subject of Her Absent Majesty 
the Queen, from Old North Austra- 
lia. I give you warning that it is 
a man you face, and no mere ani- 
mal. Let that girl go.” 

C’mell struggled as though she 
were trying to speak, but could not. 

Amaral laughed, “That’s a lie, 
animal and a bold one. I admire 
you for trying to save your mate. 
But she is mine. She is a girlygirl 
and the Instrumentality gave her 
to me. She is my pleasure. Go, bold 
cat! You are a good liar.” 

Rod took his last chance, “Scan 
me if you will.” 

He stood his ground. 

Amaral’s mind ran over his per- 
sonality like filthy hands pawing 
naked flesh. Rod recoiled at the 
dirtiness and intimacy of being felt 
by such a person’s thoughts, because 
be could sense the kinds of pleasure 

103 




and cruelty which Amaral had ex- 
perienced. He stood firm, calm, 
sure, just. He was not going to 
leave C’mell with this — this mon- 
ster from the stars, man though he 
might be, of the old true human 
stock. 

Amaral laughed. “You’re a man, 
all right. A boy. A farmer. And you 
cannot hier or spiek except for the 
button in your ear. Get out, child, 
before I box your ears!” 

Rod spoke: “Amaral, I herewith 
put you in danger.” 

Amaral did not reply with words. 

His peaked sharp face grew paler 
and the folds of his skin dilated. 
They quivered, like the edges of 
wet, torn balloons. The room began 
to fill with a sickening sweet stench, 
as though it were a candy shop in 
which all the unburied bodies had 
died weeks before. There was a 
Smell of vanilla, of sugar, of fresh 
hot cookies, of baked bread, of 
chocolate boiling in the pot: there 
was even a whiff of stroon. But as 
Amaral tensed and shook out his 
auxiliary skins each smell turned 
wrong, into a caricature and abomi- 
nation of itself. The composite was 
hypnotic. Rod glanced at C’mell. 
She had turned completely white. 

That decided him. 

The calm which he had found 
with the Catmaster might be good, 
but there were moments for calm 
and other moments for anger. 

Rod deliberately chose anger. 

He felt fury rising in him as hot 
and quick and greedy as if it had 
been love. He felt his heart go 
faster, his muscles become strong- 
er, his mind dearer. Amaral appar- 



ently had total confidence in Ms 
own poisonous and hypnotic pow- 
ers, because he was staring straight- 
forward as his skins swelled and 
waved in the air like wet leaves 
under water. The steady drizzle 
from the sprinkler kept everything 
penetratingly wet. 

Rod disregarded this. He welcom- 
ed fury. 

With his new hiering device, he 
focused on Amaral’s mind, and only 
on Amaral’s. 

Amaral saw the movement of 
his eyes and whipped a knife into 
view. 

“Man or cat, you’re dying!” said 
Amaral, himself hot with the ex- 
citement of hate and collision. 

Rod then spoke, in his worst 
scream — 

beast, filth, offal — 
spot, dirt, vileness, 
wet, nasty — 
die, die, die! 

H e was sure it was the loudest 
cry he had ever given. There 
was no echo, no effect. Amaral 
stared at him, the evil knife-point 
flickering in his hand like the flame 
atop a candle. 

Rod’s anger reached a new 
height. 

He felt pain in his mind when he 
walked forward, cramps in his 
muscles as he used them. He felt 
a real fear of the offworld poison 
which this man-creature might 
exude, but the thought of C’mell — 
cat or not cat — alone with Amaral 
was enough to give him the rage of 
a beast and the strength of a 
machine. 



104 



IF 




Only at the very last moment 
did Amaral realize Rod had broken 
loose. 

Rod never could tell whether the 
telepathic scream had really hurt 
the wet-worlder or not, because he 
did something very simple. 

He reached with all the speed of 
a Norstrilian farmer, snatched the 
knife from Amaral’s hand, ripping 
folds of soft, sticky skin with it, and 
then slashed the other man from 
davicle to clavicle. 

He jumped back in time to avoid 
the spurt of blood. 

The “wet black suit” collapsed 
as Amaral died on the floor. 

Rod took the dazed C’mell by 
the arm and led her out of the 
room. The air on the balcony was 
fresh, but the murder-smell of 
Amazonas Triste was still upon him. 
He knew that he would hate him- 
self for weeks, just from the 
memory of that smell. 

There were whole armies of 
robots and police outside. The body 
of Wush’ had been taken away. 

There was silence as they emerg- 
ed. 

Then a clear, civilized, command- 
ing voice spoke from the plaza be- 
low, “Is he dead?” 

Rod nodded. 

“Forgive me for not coming 
closer. I am the Lord Jestocost. I 
know you, C’roderick, and I know 
who you really are. These people 
are^ all under my orders. You and 
the girl can wash and wash in the 
rooms below. Then you can run a 
certain errand. Tomorrow, at the 
second hour, I will see you.” 

Robots came close to them — ap- 



parently programmed to have no 
sense of smell, because the fulsome 
stench did not bother them in the 
least. 

People stepped out of their way 
looking startled and repelled, aa 
they passed. 

Rod was able to murmur, 
“C’mell, are you all right?” 

She nodded and. she gave him a 
wan smile. Then she forced herself 
to speak. “You are brave, mister 
McBan. You are even braver than 
a cat.” 

The robots separated the two of 
them. 

Within moments Rod found little 
white medical robots taking his 
clothing off him gently, deftly and 
quickly. A hot shower, with a 
smell of medication to it, was al- 
ready hissing in the bath-stall. Rod 
was tired of wetness, tired of all 
this water everywhere, tired of wet 
things and complicated people, but 
he stumbled into the shower with 
gratitude and hope. He was still 
alive. He had unknown friends to 
help him. 

And C’mell. C’mell was safe from 
the rain-man. 

“Is this,” thought Rod, “what 
people call love?” 

The clean stringing astringency of 
the shower drove all thoughts from 
his mind. Two of the little white 
robots had followed him in. He sat 
on a hot, wet wooden bench and 
they scrubbed him with brushes 
which felt as though they would re- 
move his very skin as they worked 
to get him clean. 

Bit by bit, the terrible odor 
faded.

vn 

R od McBan went from the room 
of the stinkman to a place 
where a doctor gave him new smells 
to experience, smells of chemistry 
and of medicine and of heat and 
•old. The doctor’s name was 
Vomact, and Rod would have en- 
joyed his company if he had not 
wondered where CmeH was and 
what she was doing. 

Vomact was a small man, a full 
head shorter than Rod himself, but 
so gracefully proportioned that he 
did not look stunted or little. His 
face was thin, with a mop of un- 
governable black hair which fell in 
all directions. Among Norstrilians, 
this fashion would have been deemed 
eccentric; to judge by the fact that 
other Earthmen let their hair grow 
wild and long, it must have been 
an Earth fashion. Rod found it 
foolish but not repulsive. 

It was not Vomact’s appearance 
which caused the impression. It 
was the personality which tingled 
out of every pore. Vomact could 
become clam when he knew, from 
his medical wisdom, that kindness 
and tranquility were in order, but 
these qualities were not usual to 
him. He was vivacious, moody, live- 
ly, talkative to an extreme, but he 
was sensitive enough to the person 
to whom he was talking: he never 
became a bore. Even among 
Norstrilian women, Rod had never 
seen a person who expressed so 
much, so fluently. When Vomact 
talked, his hands were in constant 
motion — outlining, describing, 
clarifying the points which he des- 



cribed. When he talked he smiled, 
scowled, raised his eyebrows in ques- 
tioning, stared with amazement, 
looked aside in wonder. Rod was 
used to the sight of two Norstrilians 
having a long telepathic conversa- 
tion, spieking and hiering one an- 
other as their bodies reposed, com- 
fortable and immobile, while their 
minds worked directly on one an- 
other. To do all this with the speak- 
ing voice — that, to a Norstrilian, 
was a marvel to hear and behold. 
There was something graceful and 
pleasant about the animation of this 
earth doctor which stood in com- 
plete contrast to the quick danger- 
ous decisiveness of the Lords of the 
Instrumentality. Rod began to think 
that if Earth were full of people, 
all of them like Vomact, it must be 
a delightful but confusing place. 
Vomact had once hinted that his 
family was unusual, so that even in 
the long weary years of perfection, 
when everyone else had numbers, 
they kept their family name secret 
but remembered. 

UT am doctor Vomact. I know 

A that you are not a cat, mister 
and owner McBan, and it is only 
my business to check up on you. 
May I?” 

“Cmell — ” began Rod. 

“She is perfectly all right. We 
have given her a sedative and for 
the time being she is being treated 
as though she was a human woman. 
From the Instrumentality, the Lord 
Jestocost told me to suspend the 
rules in her case, and I did so. But 
I think we will both have trouble 
about the matter later on.” 



106 



IF 




Trouble?" said Rod. Til pay—" 

"No, no, it’s not payment. It’s 
just the rule that damaged under- 
people should be destroyed and not 
put in hospitals. Mind you, I treat 
them myself now and then, if I can 
do it on the sly. But now let’s have 
a look at you." 

"Why are we talking?" spieked 
Rod telepathically. "Didn’t you 
know that I can hier mind-to-mind 
now?" 

Instead of getting a physical 
examination, Rod had a wonderful 
visit with the doctor, in which they 
drank enormous glasses of a sweet 
Earth beverage called chai by the 
ancient Parosski ones. He found 
that this doctor Vomact was a can- 
didate for a Chiefship of the Instru- 
mentality, and he learned some- 
thing of the strange tests required 
for that office. He even found that 
the doctor knew more than he him- 
self did about his own financial 
position, and that the actuarial 
balances of Earth were sagging with 
the weight of his wealth, since the 
increase in the price of stroon might 
lead to shorter lives. The doctor and 
he ended by discussing the under- 
people; he found that the doctor had 
just as yivid an admiration for C'mell 
as he himself did. The evening end- 
ed when Rod said, "I’m young, doc- 
tor and sir, and I sleep well, but I’m 
never going to sleep again if you 
don’t get that smell away from me. 
I can smell it inride my nose." 

The doctor became professional. 
He said, "Open your mouth and 
breathe right into my face!" 

Rod hesitated and then obeyed. 

“Great crooked stars!" said the 

me STORE OF HEARTS DESM 



doctor. "I can smell it too. There's 
a little in your upper respiratory 
system, perhaps a little even in your 
lungs. Do you need your sense of 
smell for the next few days?" 

Rod said he did not. 

“Fine,” said the doctor. "We oan 
numb that section of the brain very 
gently. There’ll be no residual dam- 
age. You won’t smell anything for 
eight to ten days, and by that time 
the smell of Amaral will be gone. 
Incidentally, you were charged with 
first degree murder, tried and ac- 
quitted, on the matter of Tostig 
Amaral.” 

“How could I be?" said Rod. "I 
wasn’t even arrested." 

‘The Instrumentality computered 
it. Now lie down, so I can kill off 
that smell." 

Rod lay down. The doctor put 
his head in a clamp and called in 
robot assistants. The smell-killing 
process knocked him out, and when 
he wakened, it was in a different 
building. He sat up in bed and saw 
the sea itself. Cmefl was standing 
at the edge of water. He sniffed. 
He smelled no salt, no wet, no 
water — and no AmaraL It was 
worth the change. 

C ’mell came to him. "My dear, 
my very dear, my sire and mas- 
ter but my very dear! You chanced 
your life for me last night." 

"I’m a cat myself," laughed Rod. 
He leaped from the bed and ran 
out to the water margin. The im- 
mensity of blue water was incredi- 
ble. The white waves were separ- 
ate, definable miracles, each one 
of them. He had seen the enclosed 

107 




lakes of Australia, but none of them 
did things like this. 

C’mell had the tact to stay silent 
tffl he had seen his fill. 

Then she broke the news. 

“You own Earth. You have work 
to do. Either you stay here and 
begin studying how to manage your 
property, or you go somewhere else. 
Either way, something a little bit 
sad is going to happen today.” 

He looked at her seriously, his 
pajamas flapping in the wet wind 
which he could no longer smell. 

“I’m ready,” he said. “What is 
it?” 

“You lose me.” 

“Is that all?* he laughed. 

C’mell looked very hurt. She 
stretched her fingers as though she 
were a nervous cat looking for 
something to claw. 

“I thought — ” said she, and 
stopped. She turned to look at him, 
staring fully, trustingly into his face. 
“You’re such a young man, but you 
can do anything. Even among men 
you are fierce and decided. Tell me, 
what — what do you wish?” 

“Nothing much,” he smiled at 
her, “except that I am buying you 
and taking you home. We can’t go 
to Norstrilia unless the law changes, 
but we can go to New Mars. They 
don’t have any rules there, or none 
which a few tons of stroon won’t 
get changed. C’mell, I’ll stay cat. 
Will you marry me?” 

She started laughing but the 
laughter turned into weeping. She 
bugged him and buried her face 
against his chest. At last she wiped 
her ears off on her arm and looked 
up at him 



“Poor silly mel Poor silly you! 
Don’t you see it, mister? I am a 
cat. If I had children, they would 
be cat-kittens, every one of them, 
unless I went every single week to 
get the genetic code recycled so 
that they would turn out under- 
people. Don’t you know that you 
and I can never marry — not with 
any real hope? Besides, Rod, there 
is the other rule. You and I con- 
not even see each other again from 
this sunset onward. How do you 
think the Lord Jestocost saved my 
life yesterday? How did he break 
almost all the rules of the book?” 
The brightness had gone out of 
Rod’s day. “I don’t know,” he said 
dully. 

“By promising them I would die 
promptly and obediently if there 
were any more irregularities. By 
saying I was a nice animal. A bid- 
dable one. My death is hostage for 
what you and I must do. It’s not a 
law. It’s something worse than a 
law — it’s an agreement between the 
Lords of the Instrumentality.” 

“I see,” said he, understanding 
the logic of it, but hating the cruel 
Earth customs which put C’mell and 
himself together, only to tear them 
apart. 

“Let’s walk down the beach, 
Rod,” she said. “Unless you want 
your breakfast first of all . .” 

“Oh, no,” he said. Breakfast! a 
flutty crupp for all die breakfasts 
on Earth! 

She walked as though she had 
not a care in the world, but there 
was an undertone of meaning to her 
walk which warned Rod that she 
was up to something. 



108 



IF 




It happened. 

F irst, she kissed him, with a kiss 
he remembered the rest of his 
life. 

Then, before he could say a 
word, she spieked in a penetrating 
telepathic shout. But her spieking 
was not words or ideas at all. It 
was singing of a high wild kind. It 
was the music which went along 
with her very own poem, which 
she had sung to him atop Earth- 
port: 

And oh, my love, for you! 

High birds flying, and a 
High sky crying, and a 
High heart striving, and a 
High wind driving, and 
High brave place for you! 

But it was not those words, not 
those ideas, even though they 
seemed subtly different this time. 
She was doing something which the 
best telepaths of Old North Aus- 
tralia had tried in vain for thous- 
ands of years to accomplish — she 
was transmitting the mathematical 
and proportional essence of music 
right out of her mind, and she was 
doing it with a clarity and force 
which would have been worthy of 
a great orchestra. The “high wind 
driving” fugue kept recurring. 

He turned his eyes away from 
her to see the astonishing thing 
which was happening all around 
them. The air, the ground, the sea 
were all becoming thick with life. 
Fish flashed out of blue waves. 
Wings circled by the multitude 
above them. The beach was thick 
with little running birds. Dogs and 
running animals which he had never 



seen before stood restlessly around 
C’mell — hectares of them. 

Abruptly she stopped her song. 
With very high volume and 
clairty, she spat commands in all 
directions: 

‘Think of people. 

“Think of this cat and me run- 
ning away somewhere 
“Think of ships. 

“Look for strangers. 

“Think of things in the sky.” 
Rod was glad he did not have his 
broad-band telepathic hiering come 
on, as it sometimes had done at 
home. He was sure he would have 
gone dizzy with the pictures and the 
contradictions of it all. 

She had grabbed his shoulders 
and was whispering fiercely into his 
ear: 

“Rod, they’ll cover us. Please 
make a trip with me, Rod. One last 
dangerous trip. Not for you. Not for 
me. Not even for mankind. For 
life, Rod. The Aitch Eye wants to 
see you.” 

“Who’s the Aitch Eye?” 

“He’ll tell you the secret if you 
see him,” she hissed. “Do it for me, 
then, if you don’t trust my ideas.” 
He smiled. “For you, C’mell, 
yes.” 

“Don’t even think, then, till you 
get there. Don’t even ask questions. 
Just come along. Millions of lives 
depend on you, Rod.” 

She stood up and sang again, but 
the new song had no grief in it, 
no anguish, no weird keening from 
species to species. It was as cool and 
pretty as a music box, as simple 
as an assured and happy goodby. 
“That,” said C’mell, “should rat-

Ge the telepathic monitors for a 
while. They are not very imagina- 
tive anyhow, and when they get 
something like this they write up 
reports about it. Then they can’t 
understand their reports and sooner 
or later one of them asks me what 
I did. I tell them the truth.” 

“What are you going to tell them 
this time?” he asked, as they walk- 
ed back to the house. 

“That I had something which I 
did not want them to hear.” 

“They won’t take that.” 

“Of course not, but they will 
suspect me of trying to beg stroon 
for you to give to the underpeople.” 
“Do you want some, C’mell?” 
“Of course not! It’s illegal and 
it would just make me live longer 
than my natural life. Why bother?” 
They had reached die house. 
C’mell paused. 

“No questions, Rod.” The smile 
she gave him would have melted 
a monument. He felt well. He was 
amused and pleased by the physical 
delight of hiering and spieking with 
die occasional true people who pass- 
ed by. (Some underpeople could 
hier and spiek but they tried to 
conceal it, for fear that they would 
be resented.) He felt strong. Losing 
C’mell was a sad thing to do, but 
it was a whole day off; he began 
dreaming of things that he could 
do for her when they parted. Buying 
her services of thousands of people 
for the rest of her life? Giving her 
jewelry which would be the envy of 
Earthmankind? Leasing her a pri- 
vate planoform yacht? He suspected 
these might not be legal, but they 
were pleasant to think about 



vrn 

T hree hours later, he had no 
time for pleasant thoughts. 
They had flown into Earthport city, 
and they had started going down. 
Forty-five minutes of dropping had 
made his stomach very queasy. He 
felt the air go warm and stale and 
he wished desperately that he had 
not given up his sense of smell. 

Where the drop-shafts ended, the 
tunnels and the elevators began. 

Down they went, where incredi- 
bly old machinery spun slowly in 
a spray of oil, performing tasks 
which only the wildest mind could 
guess at. 

In one room, C’mell stopped and 
shouted at him over the noise of 
engines: “That’s a pump.” 

It did not look obvious. Huge tur- 
bines moved wearily. They seemed 
to be hooked up to an enormous 
steam engine powered by nuclear 
fuel. Five or six brightly-polished 
robots eyed them suspiciously as 
they walked around the machine, 
which was at least eighty meters long 
by forty-five high. 

“And come here . ” shouted 
CmeD. 

They went into another room, 
empty and dean and quiet except 
for a rigid column of moving water 
which shot from floor to ceiling 
with no evidence of machinery at 
all. An underman, sloppily formed 
from a rat body, got up from his 
rocking chair when they entered. 
He bowed to Cmell as though she 
were a great lady but she waved 
him back to his chair. 

She took Rod near the column

of water and pointed to a shiny 
ring on the floor. 

“That’s the other pump. They do 
the same amount of work.” 

“What is it?” he shouted. 

“Force-field, I guess. I’m not an 
engineer.” They went on. 

In a quieter corridor she explain- 
ed that the pumps were both of 
them for the service of weather 
control. The old one had been run- 
ning six or seven thousand years, 
and showed very little wear. When 
people needed a supplementary one, 
they had simply printed it on plas- 
tic, set it in the floor, and turned it 
on with a few amps. The underman 
was there just to make sure that 
nothing broke down or went critical. 

“Can’t real people design things 
any more?” asked Rod. 

“Only if they want to. Making 
them want to do things is the hard 
part now.” 

“You mean, they don’t want to 
do anything?” 

“Not exactly,” said Cmell, “but 
they find that we are better than 
they are at almost anything. Real 
work, that Is. Not statesmanship like 
running the Instrumentality and the 
Earth government. Here and there 
a real human being gets to work, 
and there are always offworlders 
like you to stimulate them and chal- 
lenge them with new problems. But 
they used to have secure lives of 
four hundred years, a common lan- 
guage, and a standard conditioning. 
They were dying off, just by being 
too perfect. One way to get better 
would have been to kill off us 
underpeople, but they couldn’t do 
that all the way. There was too 



much messy work to be done that 
you couldn’t count on robots for. 
Even the best robot, if he’s a com- 
puter linked to the mind of a mouse 
will do fine for routine, but unless 
he has a very complete human edu- 
cation, he’s going to make some wild 
judgments which won’t suit what 
people want. So they need under- 
people. I’m still a cat underneath it 
all, but even the cats which are 
unchanged are pretty close relatives 
of human beings. They make die 
same basic choices between power 
and beauty, between survival and 
self-sacrifice, between common sense 
and high courage. So the Lady Alice 
More worked out this plan for the 
Rediscovery of Man. Set up the 
Ancient Nations, give everybody an 
extra culture besides the old one 
based on the Old Common Tongue, 
let them get mad at each other, 
restore some disease, some danger, 
some accidents, but average it out 
so that nothing is really unchanged.” 

T hey had come to a storeroom, 
the sheer size of which made 
Rod blink. The great reception haH 
at the top of Earthport had astound- 
ed him. This room was twice the 
size. 

The room was filled with ex- 
tremely ancient cargoes which had 
not even been unpacked from their 
containers. Rod could see that some 
were marked outbound for worlds 
which no longer existed, or which 
had changed their names. Others 
were inbound,, but no one had un- 
packed them for fire thousand years 
and more. 

“What’s all this stuff?”

“Shipping, Technological change. 
Somebody wrote it all off the com- 
puters, so they didn’t have to think 
of it any more. This is the thing 
which underpeople and robots are 
searching, to supply the ancient ar- 
tifacts for the Rediscovery of Man. 
One of our boys — rat stock, with 
a human I.Q. of 300 — found 
something marked Musee Nationale. 
It was the whole National Museum 
of the Republic of Mali, which had 
been put inside a mountain when the 
ancient wars became severe. Mali 
apparently was not a very important 
‘nation,’ as they called those group- 
ings, but it had the same language 
as France, and we were able to 
supply real material, almost every- 
thing that was needed, to restore 
some kind of a French civilization. 
China has been hard. The Chinesians 
survived longer than any other na- 
tion, and they did their own grave- 
robbing. So we have found it im- 
possible to reconstruct China before 
the age of space. We can’t modify 
people into being Ancient Chinese.” 

Rod stopped, thunderstruck. “Can 
I talk to you here?” 

C’mell listened with a faraway 
look on her face. “Not here. I feel 
the very weak sweep of a monitor 
across my mind now and then. In a 
couple of minutes you can. Let’s 
hurry along.” 

“I just thought,” cried Rod, “of 
tiie most important question in all 
the worlds!” 

“Stop thinking it, then,” said 
C’mell, “until we come to a safe 
place.” 

Instead of going straight on 



through the big aisle between the 
forgotten crates and packages, she 
squeezed between two crates and 
made her way to the edge of the 
big underground storeroom. 

“That package,” she said, “is 
stroon. They lost it. We could help 
ourselves to it if we wanted to, but 
we’re afraid of it.” 

Rod looked at the names on the 
package. It had been shipped by 
Roderick Frederick Ronald Arnold 
William Mac Arthur KfcBan XXVI 
to Adaminaby Port and reconsigned 
to Earthport. “That’s seventy-five 
generations ago, shipped from the 
Station of Doom. My farm. But I 
think it turns to poison if you leave 
it for more than two hundred years. 
Our own military people have some 
horrible uses for it, when invaders 
show up, but ordinary Norstrilians, 
when they find old stroon, always 
turn it in to the Commonwealth. 
We’re afraid of it. Not that we often 
lose it. It’s too valuable and we’re 
too greedy, with a 20,000,000 per 
cent import duty on everything.” 
C’mell led on. They unexpectedly 
passed a tiny robot, a lamp fixed 
to his head, who was seated between 
two enormous piles of books. He 
was apparently reading them one 
by one, because he had beside him 
a pile of notes larger in bulk than 
he was. He did not look up, nor 
did they interrupt him. 

At the wall, C’mell said, “Now 
do exactly what you’re told. See 
the dust along the base of this 
crate?” 

“I see it,” said Rod. 

“That must be left undisturbed. 

IP 



112 




Now watch. I’m going ter jump from 
the top of this crate to the top of 
that one, without disturbing the 
dust Then I want yon to jump the 
same way and go exactly where I 
point — without even thinking about 
it, if you can manage. I’ll follow. 
Don’t try to be polite or chivalrous, 
or you’ll mess up the whole ar- 
rangement.” 

Rod nodded. 

S he jumped to a case against the 
wall. Her red hair did not fly 
behind her, because she had tied it 
up in a turban before they started 
out, when she had obtained cover- 
alls for each of them from the robot- 
servants. They had looked like an 
ordinary couple of working c’peo- 
ple. 

Either she was very strong or 
the case was very light. Standing 
on the case, she tipped it very 
delicately, so that the pattern of 
dust around its base would be un- 
changed, save for microscopic ex- 
amination. A blue glow came from 
beyond the case. With an odd, prac- 
tised turn of the wrist she indicated 
that Rod should jump from his case 
to the tipped one, and from there 
into the area — whatever it might 
be — beyond the case. It seemed 
easy for him, but he wondered if 
she could support both his weight 
and hers on the case. He remember- 
er her order not to talk or think. 
He tried to think of the salmon 
steak he had eaten the day before. 
That should certainly be a good cat- 
thought, if a monitor happened to 
catch his mind at that moment! He 



jumped, teetered on the slanting top 
of the second packing case, and 
scrambled into a tiny doorway just 
big enough for him to crawl through. 
It was apparently designed for 
cables, pipes and maintenance, not 
for habitual human Use: it was too 
low to stand in. He scrambled for- 
ward. There was a slam. 

C’mell had jumped in after him, 
letting the case fall back into its 
old, apparently undisturbed position. 

She crawled up to him. “Keep 
going,” she said. 

“Can we talk here?” 

“Of course. Do you want to? It’9 
not a very sociable place.” 

“That question, that big quest- 
tion,” said Rod. “I’ve got to ask 
you. You underpeople are aktng 
charge of people. If you’re fixing 
up their new cultures for them, 
you’re getting to be the masters of 
men!” 

“Yes,” said C’mell and let the 
explosive affirmative hang m the 
air between them. 

He couldn’t think of anything to 
say; it was his big bright idea for 
the day, and the fact that she already 
knew underpeople were becoming 
secret masters — that was too much! 

She looked at his friendly face 
and said, more gently, “We under- 
people have seen it coming for a 
long time. Some of the human peo- 
ple do, too. Especially the Lord 
Jestocost. He’s no fool. And, Rod, 
you fit in.” 

“I?” 

“Not as a person. As an economic 
change. As a source of unallocated 
power.”

“You mean, Cmell, you’re after 
me, too? I can’t believe it! I can 
recognize a pest or a nuisance or 
a robber. You don’t seem like any 
of these. You’re good, all the way 
through.” His voice faltered. “I 
meant it this morning, C'mell, when 
I asked you to marry me.” 

The delicacy of cat and the ten- 
derness of woman combined in her 
voice as she answered, “I know you 
meant it” She stroked a lock of 
hair away from his forehead, in a 
caress as restrained as any touch 
could be. “But it’s not for us. And 
I’m not using you myself, Rod. I 
want nothing for myself, but I want 
a good world for underpeople. And 
for people, too. For people, too! We 
cats loved you people long before 
we had brains. We’ve been your 
cats longer than anyone can remem- 
ber. Do you think our loyalty to 
the human race would stop just 
because you changed our shapes 
and added a lot of thinking power? 
I love you. Rod, but I love people 
too. That’s why Tm taking you to 
the Aitch Eye.” 

“Can you tell me what that is — 
now?” 

She laughed. “This place is safe. 
It’s the Holy Insurgency. The sec- 
ret government of the underpeople. 
This is a silly place to talk about 
it. Rod. You're going to meet the 
head of it, right now.” 

“All of them?” Rod was thinking 
of the Chiefs of the Instrumentality. 

“It's not a them, it’s a him. The 
R-telekelL Hie bird beneath the 
ground.” 

“If there’a only (me, how (fid 



you choose him? Is he like the Bri- 
tish Queen, whom we lost so long 
ago?” 

Cmell laughed. “We didn’t choose 
him. He grew and now he leads us. 
You people took an eagle’s egg and 
tried to make it into a Daimoni 
man. When the experiment failed, 
you threw the fetus out It lived. It’s 
he. It’ll be the strongest mind you’ve 
ever met Come on. This is no place 
to talk, and we’re still talking.” 

She started crawling down the 
horizontal shaft, waving at Rod to 
follow her. 

He followed, and as they crawl- 
ed he called to her, “Cmell, atop a 
minute.” 

S he stopped until he caught up 
with her. She thought that he 
might ask for a kiss, so worried and 
lonely did he look. She was ready 
to be kissed. He surprised her by 
saying, instead: 

“I can’t smell, CmeiL Please, I’m 
so used to smelling that I miss it 
What does this place smell like7” 
Her eyes widened and then she 
laughed. “It mells like underground. 
Electricity burning the air. Animals 
somewhere far away, a lot of dif- 
ferent smells of them. The old, old 
smell of man, almost gone. Engine 
oil and bad exhaust It smells like 
a headache. It smells like silence, 
like things untouched. There, is that 
it?” 

He nodded and they went «m. 

At ftc cod of the horizontal 
Cmell tn*ed and said, “All men 
die here. Come on!” 

Rod strned to follow and then

stopped, “C’mell, are you disco- 
ordinated? Why should I die? 
There’s no reason to.” 

Her laughter was pure happiness. 
“Silly C’rod! You are a cat , cat 
enough to come where no man has 
passed for centuries. Come on. 
Watch out for those skeletons. 
They’re a lot of them around here. 
We hate to kill real people, but 
there are some that we can’t warn 
off in time.” 

They emerged on a balcony, over- 
looking and even more enormous 
storeroom than the one before. This 
had thousands more boxes in it. 
C’mell paid no attention to it. She 
went to the end of the balcony and 
raced down a slender steel ladder. 

“More junk from the past!” she 
said, anticipating Rod’s comment. 
“People have forgotten it up above; 
we mess around in it.” 

Though he could not smell the 
air, at this depth it felt thick, heavy, 
immobile. 

Cornell did not slow down. She 
threaded her way through the junk 
and treasures on the floor as though 
she were an acrobat. On the far 
ride of the old room she stopped. 
••Take one of these,” she command- 
ed. 

They looked like enormous um- 
brellas, like the pictures his com- 
puter had showed him. These seem- 
ed oddly large, compared to the 
ones in the pictures. He looked 
around for rain. Cmell did not 
understand his suptekms. 

“The shaft,” she said, “has no 
magnetic controls, no updraft of 
air. It’s just a shaft twelve meters 



in diameter. These are parachutes. 
We jump into the shaft with them 
and then we float straight down, 
four kilometers. It's close to the 
Moho.” 

Since he did not pick up one of 
the big umbrellas, she handed him 
one. It was clumsy to hold but sur- 
prisingly light 

He blinked at her. “How will 
we ever get out?” 

“One of the bird-men will fly 
us up the shaft. It’s hard work, but 
they can do it. Be sure to hook that 
thing to your belt. It’s a long slow 
time falling, and we won’t be able 
to talk on the way. And it’s terribly 
dark, too.” 

He complied. 

She opened a big door, beyond 
which there was the feel of nothing. 
She gave him a wave, partially open- 
ed her “umbrella”, stepped over the 
edge of the door and vanished. 

He looked over the edge himself. 
There was nothing to be seen. Noth- 
ing of Cmell, no sound except for 
the slippage of air and an occasional 
mechanical whisper of metal against 
metal. He supposed that must bo 
the rib-tips of the umbrella touch- 
ing the metallic edge of the shaft as 
she fefl. 

He sighed. Norstrilia was safe 
and quiet compared to this. 

He opened his umbrella too. 

Acting on an odd premonition, 
he took his little hiering-spieking 
shell out of his ear and put it care- 
fully in his coverall pocket. This 
was his telepathic amplifier, some- 
thing like an ancient hearing aid. 
That act saved his life. 



THE STOWE OF HEART'S DESIRE

R od McBan remembered falling 
and falling. He shouted into 
the wet adhesive darkness, but there 
was no reply. He thought of cutting 
himself loose from his big umbrella 
and letting himself drop to the 
death 'below him, but then he 
thought of Cmell and he knew 
his body would drop upon her like 
a bomb. 

He wondered about his despera- 
tion, but could not understand it. 
(Only later did he find out that he 
was passing telepathic suicide screens 
which the underpeople had set up, 
screens fitted to the human mind, 
designed to dredge filth and de- 
spair from the paleocortex, the 
smell-bite-mate sequence of the nose- 
guided animals who first walked 
Earth. But Rod was cat enough, 
just barely cat enough, and he was 
also telepathically subnormal, so 
that the screens did not do to him 
what they would have done to any 
normal man of Earth — delivered 
a twisted dead body at the bottom. 
No man had ever gotten that far, 
but the underpeople were resolved 
that none ever should.) 

Rod twisted in his harness and at 
last he fainted. 

He awakened in a relatively small 
room, enormous by Earth standards 
but still much smaller than the 
storerooms which he had passed 
through on the way down. The 
lights were bright. He suspected 
that the room stank but he could 
not prove it with his smell gone. 

A man was speaking: “The For- 



bidden Word is never given unless 
the man who does not know it plain- 
ly asks for it.” 

There was a chorus of voices 
sighing, “We remember. We remem- 
ber what we remember.” 

The speaker was almost a giant, 
thin and pale. His face was the 
face of a dead saint, white as ala- 
baster, with glowing eyes. His body 
was that of man and bird both, man 
from the hips up, except that human 
hands grew out of the elbows of 
enormous, clean white wings. From 
the hips down to his legs were bird- 
legs, ending in horny, almost trans- 
lucent bird-feet which stood steadily 
on the ground. 

“I am sorry, mister and owner 
McBan, that you took that risk. I 
was misinformed. You are a good 
cat on the outside but still complete- 
ly a human man on the inside. Our 
safety devices bruised your mind and 
they might have killed you.” 

Rod stared at the man as he stum- 
bled to his feet. He saw that Cmell 
was one of the people helping him. 
When he was erect, someone handed 
him a beaker of very cold water. 
He drank it thirstily. It was hot 
down here — hot, stuffy, and with 
the feel of big engines nearby. 

“I,” said the great bird-man, “am 
E-telekeli.” He pronounced it Ee- 
telly-kelly. “You are the first human 
being in all of time to see me in 
the flesh.” 

“Blessed, blessed, blessed, four- 
fold blessed is the name of our 
leader, our father, our brother, our 
son the E-telekeli,” chorused the 
underpeople.

Rod looked around There was 
every kind of underperson imagin- 
able here, including several that he 
had never even thought of. One 
was a head on a shelf, with no ap- 
parent body. When he looked, some- 
what shocked, directly at the head, 
its face smiled and one eye closed 
in a deliberate wink. The E-telekeli 
followed his glance. “Do not let 
us shock you. Some of us are nor- 
mal, but many of us down here are 
the discards of men’s laboratories. 
This is my son, who has come here 
to meet you this day.” 

A tall, very pale young man 
with no feathers stood up at this 
point. He was stark naked and com- 
pletely unembarrassed. He held out 
a friendly hand to Rod. Rod was 
sure he had never seen the young 
man before. The young man sensed 
Rod’s hesitation and said, “I am the 
E-ikasus.” 

“Blessed, blessed, threefold blessed 
is the name of our leader-to-be, the 
Yeekasoose!” chanted the under- 
people. 

Something about the scene caught 
Rod’s rough Norstrilian humor. He 
spoke to the great underman as he 
would have spoken to another mis- 
ter-and-owner back home, friendlily 
but bluntly. “Glad you welcome me, 
sir!” 

“Glad, glad, glad is the stranger 
from beyond the stars!” sang the 
chorus. 

“Can’t you make them shut up?” 
asked Rod. 

“ ‘Shut up, shut up, shut up,’ says 
the stranger from the starsl” chor- 
used the group. 



T he E-telekeli did not exactly 
laugh, but his smile was not 
pure benevolence. “We can disre- 
gard them and talk, or I can blank 
out your mind everytlme they repeat 
what we say. This is a sort of court 
ceremony.” 

Rod glanced around. “I’m in your 
power already,” said he, “so it won’t 
matter if you mess around with my 
mind. Blank them out.” 

The E-telekeli stirred the ah 
in front of him as though he were 
writing a mathematical equation 
with his finger. Rod’s eyes followed 
the finger and he suddenly felt the 
room quiet down. 

“Come over here and sit down,” 
said the E-telekeli. 

Rod followed. “What do you 
want?” he asked as he followed. 

The E-telekeli did not even turn 
around to answer. He merely spoke 
while walking ahead. “Your money, 
mister and owner McBan. Almost all 
of your money.” 

Rod stopped walking. He heard 
himself laughing wildly. “Money? 
You? Here? What could you pos- 
sibly do with R?” 

“That,” said die E-telekeH, “is 
why you should sit down.” 

“Do sit,” said Cmell, who had 
followed. 

Rod sat down. 

“We are afraid that Man himself 
will die and leave us alone in the 
universe. We need Man, and there 
is still an immensity of time before 
we all pour into a common destiny. 
People have always assumed that 
the end of things is around the 
corner, and we have the promise of

the First Forbidden One that this 
will be so. But it could be hundreds 
of thousands of years. Maybe mil- 
lions. People are scattered, mister 
McBan, so that no weapon will 
ever kill them all on all planets. 
But no matter how scattered they 
are, they are still haunted by them- 
selves. They reach a point of de- 
velopment and then they stop.” 
“Yes,” said Rod, reaching for a 
carafe of water and helping himself 
to another drink. “But it’s a long 
way from the philosophy of the 
universe down to my money. We 
have plenty of barmy swarmy talk 
in Old North Australia, but I never 
heard of anybody asking for anoth- 
er citizen’s money, right off the bat.” 
The eyes of the E-telekeli glowed 
like cold fire but Rod knew that 
this was no hynosis, no trick being 
played upon himself. It was the 
sheer force of the personality burn- 
ing outward from the birdman. 

“Listen carefully, mister McBan. 
We are the creatures of man. You 
are gods to us. You have made us 
into people who talk, who worry, 
who think, who love, who die. Most 
of our races were the friends of man 
before we became underpeople. Like 
Cornell. How many cats have served 
and loved man, and for how long? 
How many cattle have worked for 
men, been eaten by men, been milk- 
ed by men across the ages, and 
have stffl followed where men went? 
Even to the stars. And dogs. I do 
not have to tell you about the love 
of dogs for men. We call ourselves 
the Holy Insurgency because we 
are rebels. We are a government 



We are a power almost as big as 
the Instrumentality. Why do you 
think Teadrinker did not catch you 
when you arrived?” 

“Who is Teadrinker?” 

“An official who wanted to kid- 
nap you. He failed because his un- 
derm an reported to me. We love 
you. Rod, not because you are a 
rich Norstrilian, but because it is 
our faith to love the mankind which 
created us.” 

“This is a long slow wicket for 
my money,” said Rod. “Come to the 
point, sir ” 

T lie E-telekeli smiled with sweet- 
ness and sadness. Rod imme- 
diately knew that it was his own 
denseness which made the bird-man 
sad ‘‘nd patient. For the very first 
time he began to accept the feeling 
that this person might actually be 
the superior of any human. 

“I’m sorry,” said Rod. “I haven’t 
had a minute to enjoy my money 
since I got it. People have been 
telling me that everybody is after 
it. I’m beginning to think that I 
shall do nothing but run the rest of 
my life . .” 

The E-telekeli smiled happily, the 
way a teacher smiles when a student 
has suddenly turned in a spectacular 
performance. “Correct. You have 
learned a lot. I am offering you 
something more — the chance to 
do enormous good. Have you ever 
heard of Foundations?” 

Rod frowned. “The bottoms of 
buildings?” 

“No. Institutions. From the very 
ancient past.”

Rod shook his head. He hadn’t. 

“If a gift was big enough, it en- 
dured and kept on giving, until the 
culture in which it was set had 
fallen. If you took most of your 
money and gave it to some good, 
wise men, it could be spent over 
and over again to improve the race 
of man. We need that. Better men 
will give us better lives. Do you 
think that we don’t know how pilots 
and pinlighters have sometimes 
died, saving their cats in space?” 
“Or how they kill underpeople 
without a thought?” countered Rod. 
“Or humiliate them without noticing 
that they do it It seems to me that 
you must have some self-interest 

■_ n 

SIT. 

“I do. Some. But not so much as 
you think. Men are evil when they 
are frightened or bored. They are 
good when they are happy and 
busy. I want you to give your money 
to provide games, sports, competi- 
tions, shows, music — and a chance 
for honest hatred.” 

“Hatred?” said Rod. “I was be- 
ginning to think that I had found 
a Believer bird . somebody who 
mouthed old magic.” 

“We’re not ending time,” said 
the great bird-man. “We are just al- 
tering the material conditions of 
man’s situation for the present his- 
torical period. We want to steer 
mankind away from tragedy and 
self-defeat. Though the cliffs crum- 
ble, we want man to remain. Do 
you know Swinburne?” 

“Where is it?” said Rod. 

“It’s not a place. It’s a poet, be- 
fore the age of space. Listen.” 



Till the slow sea rise and the sheer 
cliff crumble, 

Till terrace and meadow the deep 
gulfs drink, 

Till the strength of the waves of the 
high tide crumble 

The fields that lessen, the rocks that 
shrink, 

Here now in his triumph where all 
things falter, 

Stretched out on the spoils that his 
own hand spread. 

As a god self-slain on hts own 
strange altar, 

Death lies dead. 

“Do you agree with that?” 

“It sounds nice, but I don’t un- 
derstand it,” said Rod. “Please, sir, 
I’m tireder than I thought. And I 
have only this one day with C’mell. 
Can I finish the business with you 
and have a little time with her?” 

The great underman lifted his 
arms. His wings spread like a cano- 
py over Rod. 

“So be it!” he said, and the words 
rang out like great song. 

Rod could see the lips of the 
underpeople chorusing, but he did 
not notice the sound. 

“I offer you a tangible bargain. 
Tell me if you find I read your 
mind correctly.” 

Rod nodded, somewhat in awe. 

“You want your money, but you 
do not want it. You will keep one 
hundred thousand credits, FOE 
money, which will leave you the 
richest man in Old North Australia 
for the rest of a very long life. The 
rest you will give to a foundation 
which will teach men to hate easily 
and lightly, as in a game, not sickly 
and wearily, as in habit. The trust- 
ees will be Lords of the Instru- 
mentality whom I know, such as 



120 



IF 




Jestocost, Crudelta, the Lady Jo- 
hanna Gnade.” 

“And what do I get?” 

“Your heart’s desire.” The beau- 
tiful wise pale face stared down at 
Rod like a father seeking to fathom 
the puzzlement of his own child. 
Rod was a little afraid of the face, 
but he confided in it, too. 

“I want too much. I can’t have 
it all.” 

“I’ll tell you what you want. First, 
you want to be home right now, and 
all the trouble done with. I can start 
you back to the Station of Doom 
this very night.” 

“But I want to see Earth!” 
“Come back, when you are older 
and wiser. Some day. See what your 
money has done.” 

“Well — ” said Rod. 

“You want C’mell.” The bland 
wise white face showed no embar- 
rassment, no anger, no condescen- 
sion. “You shall have her, in a 
linked dream, her mind to yours, 
for a happy subjective time of about 
a thousand years. You will live 
through all the happy things that 
you might have done together if 
you had stayed here and become a 
c’man. You will see your kitten- 
children flourish, grow old and die. 
That will take about one half-hour.” 
“It’s just a dream,” said Rod. 
“You want to take megacredits from 
me and give me a dreamy!” 

“With two minds? Two living, ac- 
celerated minds , thinking into each 
other? Have you ever heard of that?” 
“No,” said Rod. 

“Do you trust me?” said the E- 
telekeli. 



Rod stared at the bird-man in- 
quisitively and a great weight fell 
from him. He did trust this crea- 
ture, more than he had ever trusted 
the father who did not want him, 
the mother who gave him up, the 
neighbors who looked at him and 
were kind. He sighed, “I trust you.” 

“I also,” added the E-telekeli, 
“will take care of all the little in- 
cidentals through my own network 
and I will leave the memory of them 
in your mind. If you trust me that 
should be enough. You get home, 
safe. You are protected, off Nor- 
strilia, into which I rarely reach, 
for as long as you live. You have 
a separate life right now with C’mell 
and you will remember most of it. 
In return, you go to the wall and 
transfer your fortune, minus one-half 
FOE megacredit, to the Foundation 
of Rod McBan.” 

Rod did not see that the under- 
people thronged around him like 
worshippers. He had to stop when 
a very pale, tall girl took his hand 
and held it to her cheek. “You may 
not be the promised One, but you 
are a great and good man. We can 
take nothing from you. We can only 
ask. That is the teaching of Joan. 
And you have given.” 

“Who are you?” said Rod in a 
frightened voice, thinking that she 
might be some lost human girl whom 
the underpeople had abducted to 
the guts of the Earth. 

“E-lamelanie, daughter of the E- 
telekeli.” 

Rod stared at her and went to 
the wall. He pushed a routine sort 
of button. What a place to find it! 



THE STORE OF HEART'S DESIRE 



121 




"The Lord Jestocost," he called. 
"McBan speaking. No, you fool, I 
own this system.” 

A handsome, polished plumpish 
man appeared on the screen. This 
was the Lord Jestocost himself, one 
of the governing Instrumentality. 
"If I guess right,” said the strange- 
man, “you are the first human being 
ever to get into the depths. Can I 
serve you, mister and owner Mc- 
Ban?” '! 

“Take a note — ” said the E- 
telekeli, out of sight of the machine, 
beside Rod. 

Rod repeated it. 

The Lord Jestocost called witnes- 
ses at his end. 

I t was a long dictation, but at last 
the conveyance was finish- 
ed. Only at one point did Rod balk. 
When they tried to call it the McBan 
Foundation, he said, “Just call it 
the One Hundred and Fifty Fund." 

“One Hundred and Fifty?” asked 
Jestocost. 

“For my father. It’s his number 
in our family. I’m to-the-hundred- 
and-fifty-first. He was before me. 
Don’t explain the number. Just use 
it.” 

“All clear,” said Jestocost. “Now 
we have to get notaries and official 
witnesses to veridicate our imprints 
of your eyes, hand and brain. Ask 
the Person with you to give you 
a mask, so that the cat-man face 
will not upset the witnesses. Where 
is this machine you are using sup- 
posed to be located? I know perfect- 
ly well where I think it is." 

“At the foot of Alpha Ralpha, in 
122 



a forgotten market," and the E- 
telekeli. “Your servicemen will find 
it there tomorrow when they come 
to check the authenticity of the ma- 
chine.” He still stood out of line of 
the machine, so that Jestocost could 
hear him but not see him. 

“I know the voice," said Jesto- 
cost. “It comes to me as in a real 
dream. But I shall not ask to see 
file face.” 

“Your friend down here has gone 
where only underpeople go," said 
the E-telekeli, “and we are disposing 
of his fate in more ways than one, 
my lord. Subject to your gracious 
approval.” 

“My approval does not seem to 
have been needed much," snorted 
Jestocost, with a little laugh. 

“I would like to talk to you. Do 
you have any intelligent underper- 
son near you?” 

“I can call Cmell. She’s always 
somewhere around." 

“This time, my lord, you cannot 
She’s here." 

“There? With you ? I never knew 
she went there." The amazement 
showed on the face of the Lord 
Jestocost. 

“She is here, nevertheless. Do you 
have some other underperson?" 

Rod felt like a dummy, standing 
in the visiphone while the two voices, 
unseen by one another, talked past 
him. But he felt, very truly, that 
they both wished him well. He was 
almost nervous in anticipation of 
the strange happiness which had 
been offered to him and Cmell, but 
he was a respectful enough young 
man to wait until the great ones 
got through their business. 



IP 




“Wait a moment,” said Jestocost. 
On the screen, in the depths, Rod 
could see the Lord of the Instru- 
mentality work the controls of 
other, secondary screens. A moment 
later Jestocost answered: 

“B’dank is here. He will enter 
the room in a few minutes.” 

“Twenty minutes from now, my 
sir and lord, will you hold hands 
with your servant B’dank as you 
once did with C’mell? I have the 
problem of this young man and his 
return. There are things which you 
do not know, and I would rather 
not put them on the wires.” 

Jestocost hesitated only for the 
slightest of moments. “Good, then,” 
he laughed. “I might as well be 
hanged for a sheep as for a lamb.” 
The E-telekeli stood aside. Some- 
one handed Rod a mask which hid 
his cat-man features and still left 
his eyes and hands exposed. The 
brainprint was gotten through the 
eyes. 

The recordings were made. 

Rod went back to the bench and 
table. He helped himself to another 
drink of water from the carafe. 
Someone threw a wreath of fresh 
flowers around his Shoulders. Fresh 
flowers! In such a place ... he 
wondered. Three rather pretty und- 
ergirls, two of them of cat origin 
and one of them derived from dogs, 
were leading a freshly dressed 
C’mell toward him. She wore the 
simplest and most modest of all 
possible white dresses. Her waist 
was cinched by a broad golden belt. 
She laughed, stopped laughing and 
then blushed as they led her to Rod. 

Two seats were arranged on the 
THE STORE OF HEART'S DESIRE 



bench. Cushions were disposed so 
that both of them would be com- 
fortable. Silky metallic caps used in 
surgeries, were fitted on their heads. 
Rod felt his sense of smell ex- 
plode within his brain; it came alive 
richly and suddenly. He took C’mell 
by the hand and began walking 
through the immemorial Earth for- 
est, with a temple older than time 
shining in the clear soft light cast 
by Earth’s old moon. He knew that 
he was already dreaming. C’mell 
caught his thought and said, “Rod, 
my master and lover, this is a dream. 
But I am in it with you . .” 

XI 

W ho can measure a thousand 
years of happy dreaming — 
the travels , the hunts, the picnics, 
the visits to forgotten and empty 
cities, the discovery of beautiful 
views and strange places? And the 
love, and the sharing, and the re- 
flection of everything wonderful 
and strange by two separate , dis- 
tinct and utterly harmonious per- 
sonalities. C’mell the c’girl and C’ro- 
derick the c’man; they seemed 
happily doomed to be with one 
another. Who can live whole cen- 
turies of real bliss and then report 
it in minutes? Who can tell the full 
tale of such real lives — happiness , 
quarrels, reconciliations , problems , .. 
solutions and always sharing, happi- 
ness, and more sharing . ? 

W hen they awakened Rod very 
gently, they let C’mell sleep 
on. He looked down at himself and 
expected to find himself old. But 

123 




he was a young man still, in the 
deep forgotten underground of the 
E-telekeli, and he could not even 
smell. He reached for the thousand 
wonderful years as he watched 
C’mell, young again, lying on the 
bench, but the dream-years had 
•tarted fading even as he reached 
for them. 

Rod stumbled on his feet. They 
led him to a chair. The E-telekeli 
sat in an adjacent chair, at the 
same table. He seemed weary. 

“My mister and owner McBan, I 
monitored your dream sharing, just 
to make sure it stayed in the right 
general direction. I hope you are 
satisfied.” 

Rod nodded, very slowly, and 
reached for the carafe of water, 
which someone had re-filled while 
he slept. Slept, and lived, and dream- 
ed, and grew old, and woke. 

“While you slept, mister McBan,” 
said the great E-man, “I had a tele- 
pathic conference with the Lord Jes- 
tocost, who has been your friend, 
even though you do not know him. 
You have heard of the new auto- 
matic planoform ships.” 

“They are experimental,” said 
Rod. 

“So they are,” said the E-tdekdi, 
“but perfectly safe. And the best 
‘automatic’ pilots are not automatic 
at all. They have snake-men pilots. 
My pilots. They can outperform any 
pilots of the Instrumentality.” 

“Of course,” said Rod, “because 
they are dead.” 

“No more dead than I,” laughed 
the white calm bird of the under- 
ground. “I put them in cataleptic 
trances, with the help of my son 

124 



the doctor E-ikasus. On the ships 
they wake up. One of them can take 
you to Norstrilia in a single long 
fast jump. And my son can work 
on you right here. We have a good 
medical workshop in one of those 
rooms. It will seem like a single 
night to you, though it will be sev- 
eral days in objective time. If you 
say goodbye to me now, and if you 
are ready to go, you will wake 
up in orbit just outside the Old 
North Australian subspace net. I 
have no wish for one of my under- 
people to tear himself to pieces if 
he meets Mother Hitton’s dreadful 
little kittens, whatever they may 
be. Do you happen to know?” 

“I don’t know,” said Rod quick- 
ly, “and if I. did, I couldn’t tell you. 
It’s the Queen’s secret. ” 

“The Queen?” 

“The Absent Queen. We use it 
to mean the Commonwealth govern- 
ment. Anyhow, mister bird, I can’t 
go now. I’ve got to go back up to 
the surface of Earth. And I want 
my stamp that the catmaster gave 
me. And the books.” 

“Do you trust me, mister and 
owner McBan?” The white giant 
rose to his feet; his eyes shone like 
fire. 

The underpeople spontaneously 
chorused, “Put your trust in the 
joyful lawful, put your trust in the 
loyal-awful bright blank power of 
the under-bird!” 

“I’ve trusted you with my life 
and my fortune, so far,” said Rod, 
a little sullenly, “but you’re not 
going to make me go. No matter 
how much I want to get home. And 

V 




I have an old enemy a* home that 
I want to help. Houghton Syme the 
Hon. Sec. There might be something 
on Old Earth which I could take 
back to him.” 

M T think you can trust me a little 
further,” said the E-telekeli. “Would 
it solve the problem of the Hon. 
Sec. if you gave him a dream-share 
with someone he loved, to make up 
his having a short life?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe.” 

*T can,” said the master of under- 
people, “have h is prescription made 
up. It will have to be mixed with 
plasma from his blood before he 
takes it. It would be good for about 
three thousand years of subjective 
life. We have never let this out of 
our own undercity before, but you 
are the Friend of Earth, and you 
shall have it.” 

Rod tried to stammer his thanks. 

The white giant took Rod by the 
arm and led him back to the visi- 
phone, still trembling with the con- 
nection for Earth’s surface, many 
kilometers above. 

Rod trembled. Odd shards of 
dream-memory, coming out of his 
recently dreamed “life” with C’mell, 
pulsed through his mind. 

The bird-giant showed him the 
surface of Earth by borrowing a 
spying eye through the visiphone. 
They swooped through the streets 
of earth one last time. Rod saw 
his rare postage stamps — Cape 
triangles, they were, printed before 
the beginning of time — being pack- 
ed carefully into a metal box which 
had his formal address printed on 
it, very proper indeed: 

THE STORE Of HEARTS DESIRE 



Roderick Frederick Ronald 
Arnold William MacArthur McBan 
CLI 

“The Station of Doom” 
c-o Any Lawful Entry-port 
Planet of Old North Australia 

A t last the E-telekeli sighed and 
Rod sighed with him. 
“Enough?” asked the pale bird- 
giant. 

“Enough,” said Rod. He started 
to leave the visiphone and then 
stopped. 

Rod made no move to leave. He 
had turned off the screen but he 
just stood there. 

“Something else?” said the E- 
telekeli. 

“She’s all right,” said the lord 
of the underworld. “She expects 
nothing from you. She’s a good 
underperson.” 

“/ want to do something for her.” 
“There’s nothing she wants. She 
is happy. You do not need to med- 
dle.” 

“She won’t be a girlygirl forever,” 
Rod insisted. “You underpeople get 
old. I don’t know how you manage 
without stroon.” 

“Neither do I,” said the E-telekeli. 
“I just happen to have long life. 
But you’re right about her. She 
will age soon enough, by your kind 
of time.” 

“I’d like to buy the restaurant 
for her, the one the bear-man has, 
and let it become a sort of meeting 
place open to people and under- 
people. She could give it the ro- 
mantic and interesting touch so that 
k could be & success.” 



120 




“A wonderful idea. A perfect pro- 
ject for your Foundation,” smiled 
the E-telekeli. “It shall be done.” 
The bird-man went on: “Now, if 
you are ready, we will put you to 
sleep, my son E-ikasus will change 
you out of your cat body and you 
will wake in orbit around your 
home.” 

“C’mell? Can you wake her up 
so I can say goodbye after that 
thousand years?” 

The master of the underworld 
took Rod gently by the arm and 
walked him across the huge under- 
ground room, talking as they went. 
“Would you want to have another 
goodbye, after that thousand years 
she remembers with you, if you 
were she? Let her be. It is kinder this 
way. You are human. You can 
afford to be rich with kindness. It 
is one of the best traits which you 
human people have.” 

Rod stopped. “Do you have a 
recorder of some kind, then? She 
welcomed me to Earth wRh a won- 
derful little song about "high birds 
crying* and I want to leave one of 
our Norstrilian songs for her.” 

“Sing anything,” said the E-tele- 
keli, “and the chorus of my attend- 
ants will remember it as long as 
they live. The others would appre- 
ciate it too.” 

Rod looked around at the under- 
people who had followed them. For 
a moment he was embarrassed at 
singing to all of them, but when 
he saw their warm, adoring smiles, 
he was at ease with them. “Remem- 
ber this, then, and be sure to sing 
it to C’mell for me, when she 



awakens.” He lifted his voice a little 
and sang. 

Ron where the ram Is dancing, 
prancing! 

Listen where the ewe Is greeting, 
bleating. 

Rush where the lambs are running, 
funning. 

Watch where the stroon is flowing, 
growing. 

See how the men are reaping, heap- 
ing 

Wealth for their world! 

Look where the hiUs are dipping, 
ripping. 

Sit where the air is frying, drying. 

Go where the clouds are pacing, 
racing. 

Stand where the wealth is gleam* 
ing, teeming. 

Shout to the top of the singing ring- 
ing 

Norstrilian power and pride! 

The chorus sang it back at him 
with a wealth and richness which 
he had never heard in the little 
song before. 

“And now,” said the E-telekeli, 
“the blessing of the First Forbidden 
One be upon you.” The giant bowed 
a little and kissed Rod McBan on 
the forehead. Rod thought it strange 
and started to speak, but the eyes 
were upon him . 

Eyes — like twin fires. 

Fire — like friendship and like 
warmth, like a welcome and a fare- 
well. 

Eyes — which became a single 
fire. 

He awakened only when he was 
in orbit around the planet of Old 
North Australia. 

T he descent was easy. The ship 
had a viewer. The pilot 
s aid very little. 



126 




He put Rod down in the Station 
of Doom, a few hundred meters 
from his own door. He left two 
heavy packages. An Old North Aus- 
tralian patrol ship hovered overhead 
and the air hummed with danger 
while Norstrilian police floated to 
the ground and made sure that no 
one besides Rod McBan got off. 
The Earth ship whispered and was 
gone. 

‘Til give you a hand, mister,” 
said one of the police. He clutched 
Rod with one mechanical claw of 
his omithopter, caught the two pack- 
ages in the other, and flung his 
machine into the air with a single 
beat of the giant wings. They coast- 
ed into the yard. The wings tipped 
up, Rod and his packages were 
deposited deftly and the machine 
flapped away back to its distant 
base in silence. 

There was nobody there. He knew 
that Aunt Doris would come soon. 
And somebody else. His own sweet- 
heart, on his own farm — Lavinia. 
Lavinia! Here, now, on this dear 
poor dry earth, he knew how much 
Lavinia suited him. Now he could 
spiek, he could hier! 

It was strange. Yesterday — or 
was it yesterday, for it felt like 
yesterday? — he had fek very young 
indeed. He seemed to know in his 
deepest mind that Cmell had never 
been more than nine-tenths his, and 
that other tenth — the most valu- 
able and beautiful and most secret 
tenth of her life — was forever 
given to some other man or under- 
man who he would never know. He 
felt that Cmell would never give 
her heart again. And yet he kept 

TNI STORE OF HEART'S DESIRE 



for her a special kind of tenderness, 
which would never recur. It was not 
marriage which they had had, but 
it was pure romance. 

But here, here waited home itself, 
and love. 

Lavinia was in it, dear Lavinia 
with her mad lost father and her 
kindness to a Rod who had not let 
much kindness into his life. 

Suddenly, the words of an old 
poem rose unbidden to his mind: 

Ever. Never. Forever. 

Three words. The lever 

Of life upon time. 

Never, forever, ever I 

He spieked. He spieked very loud, 

“Lavinia!” 

Beyond the hill the cry came 
back, right into his mind, “Rod, 
Rod! Oh, Rod! Rod? 

“Yes,” he spieked. “Don’t run. 
I’m home.” 

He felt her mind coming near, 
though she must have been beyond 
one of the nearby hills. When he 
touched minds with Lavinia, he 
knew that this was her ground, and 
his too. Nor for them the wet won- 
ders of Earth, the golden-haired 
beauties of C’mell and Earth people! 
He knew without doubt that Lavinia 
would love and recognize the new 
Rod as she had loved the old. 

He waited very quietly and then 
he laughed to himself under the 
gray nearby friendly sky of Nor- 
strilia. He had momentarily the 
childish impulse to rush across the 
hills of his home and to kiss his 
own computer. 

He waited for Lavinia instead.

Dear Editor: 

I have just finished the Nov- 
ember //, and it prompted me to 
write my first letter to a maga- 
zine. 

Firstly, I am amazed how a maga- 
zine such as If could improve as 
much as it has in as little time as 
it has. There is not one point of 
the mag which has not increased in 
interest. 

Secondly, I suggest you have 
Keith Laumer sign an eighty-year 
contract. The more he writes, the 
better he gets, and he’s writing more 
and more these days. The Retief 
series can’t be beat as space opera 
and his singles in Worlds of Tomor- 
row are among the best I’ve seen 
in years. 

Thirdly, I just finished The Reefs 
of Space in If and All We Mars - 
men in Worlds of Tomorrow and 
they have strengthened my opin- 
ion of serial stories. In my opin- 
ion there is nothing more suspense- 
ful than a good serial, and these 
are two of the best I’ve ever read. 



Fourthly, Worlds of Tomorrow 
has proved to be beyond my wildest 
expectations. Every one of these 
stories is from good to excellent. 
I’m quite pleased over the resump- 
tion of Jack Sharkey’s “contact” 
series. If only they could all be as 
good as The Creature Inside. 

Fifthly, Jonathan Brand. Hear, 
hear! I’d like to see more by this 
fellow. 

Finally, how about having an an- 
nual contest for amateur writers, 
the five best stories appearing 
throughout the following year in 
one of the Galaxy publications, with 
criticism being offered to the con- 
testants? The chance for recogni- 
tion in one of the top sf mags 
of the business could attract a lot 
of new talent. — Sydney Silver- 
stein, 8104 Thouron Avenue, Phila- 
delphia 50, Pennsylvania.

Dear Editor: 

Congratulations on your Janu- 
ary issue. It was undoubtedly the 
best I've seen this year (the first, 
too). The cover was good — very 
distinctive — except that I don't 
think much of your habit of blurb- 
ing your novels on the cover and 
putting features on the spine. It 
makes the mag seem (even) pulpier 
than it is. 

More Van Vogt, more Van Vogt, 
more Van Vogt! By the way, what 
about his Haunted Atoms which 
was in Authentic in 1951 and SF 
Digest in 1954? 

I wonder if some of your readers 
could help me with a little ques- 
tion I have. Sometime between 1953 
and 1954 or thereabouts I read my 
first sf magazine. Now I wonder 
what it was. All I remember about 
it was two of the stories. The first 
one was about this alien spaceship. 
It dropped this bright-yellow blob 
on the Earth, and the blob grew 
until it covered the entire planet 
except for one island with a man on 
it. It turned out that the blob had 
transformed all the people of Earth 
into sort of monsters. 

The other story was about an 
alien who is spotted by hunters as 
he gets out of his ship. The alien 
shoots one of them and he becomes 
encased in jelly-like substance. The 
other hunters chase the alien into a 
village, where he is rammed by a 
car and finally killed. The alien 
has been clutching a bag to his side, 



and just as the villagers are about 
to open it, the hunter who was shot 
turns up feeling ten years younger. 
Then the villagers discover that in 
the bag was a bag of grass seed and 
a Holy Bible. Does anyone know 
what magazine this was? — Robert 
Olsen, 1006 Buoy, Orange, Califor- 
ia. 

# More Van Vogt? Coming up in 
the next issue ! — Editor. •

Dear Editor: 

Jim Maugham's letter (IF, Jan- 
uary ’64) on the subject of letter 
columns and S-F reader motiva- 
tion, calls up a number of thoughts: 

If a reader really has reforming 
instincts he ought to write the kind 
of letters he wants to see. If they 
are good enough they'll be published 
and answered by other readers. 
It’s mainly up to the people who 
write the letters to determine the 
character of Hue and Cry or any 
other forum. 

The readers want hot discussions, 
new ideas, sweeping concepts, 
unique philosophies — or so they 
say. Frankly, most S-F readers 
don't seem to care for new thoughts 
any more than anyone else. In actual 
point of fact, they read primarily 
for escape, they react in a mild and 
passive manner to the supposed 
mental stimulation of the stories, 
and their comments are limited to 
expressions of generalized approval 
and petty dislkes.

Dear Editor: 

I feel that If, Galaxy and Worlds 
of Tomorrow are probably the best 
science-fiction publications on the 
market today. But the trouble with 
your magazine, and all the others 



129 




too, is that you do not report the 
news of what is going on in the 
world of science-fiction fandom. 
You never report on science-fiction 
organizations, conventions, or even 
review fanzines. I would appreci- 
ate it if you would please print this 
letter in your magazine so the read- 
ers may decide and Comment on this. 
Thank you very much. — Guy 
Guden, 1013 South Malden, Fuller-

Dear Editor: 

Gaughan’s cover for the Novem- 
ber If was wonderful. A few like 
this and he might win the Hugo, 
instead of just getting nominated. 
That drawing he had on page ft, 
though. Is it so very needful that 
every square inch be full of marks? 
I shouldn’t think so. 

The Governor of Glave was one 
of the best Retief so far, Muck 
Man was pretty good, A Better 
Mousetrap was all right, but I 
would have liked to seen more 
from Brunner. Knight’s story was 
a bit disappointing, however it had 
fts high points, too. 

I wouldn’t say that Long Day in 
Court is the best “first” you have 
had as yet, for you have had some 
very god ones. But I will say it 
was one of the best, and Fm happy 
to see that Mr. Brand has more 
stories yet to be published. By the 
way, have any of your other firsts 
sold anything else to you? — Hank 
Luttrell, Rt. 13-2936 Barrett Sta. 
Rd., Kirkwood 22, Missouri. 

• Yep. Gary Wright (he wrote 
Captain of the Kali) has a new 
one coming up soon, and several 
others are in the offing. — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I enjoy IF very much. I have not 
been reading it long, but already it 
is my favorite magazine. I especial- 
ly liked the Crossword Puzzle. 

My only regret about If is that I 
enjoy it so much and it only comes 
out once every two months. — Drake

Dear Editor: 

I was disappointed in the ending 
of your serial, The Reefs of Space . 
The ending was contrived, uncon- 
vincing, glib and much too fast I 
had the impression that the writers, 
having written our hero (Ryeland) 
and themselves into a corner, were 
not willing to take the hard, pain- 
staking work needed to write a con- 
vincing ending to the story. But they 
are professionals, and Fm used to 
seeing professional work from them. 
I did, for 5/6 of the story; but the 
ending left me unbelieving. Back to 
your typewriters, boys, and do your 
homework ! — Michael N. TforsteLa,

12 famous authors start a 
new kind of writing school 



If you have writing talent worth developing, 
here’s an opportunity never before available: 

Twelve of America’s most famous authors 
have created a school of professional writing 
to help you develop your skill, talent and 
craftsmanship . and to pass on to you their 
secrets of achieving success and recognition. 

This unique home-training program is su- 
pervised by Rod Serling, winner of five Em- 
mys for TV writing; Pulitzer Prize historian 
Bruce Catton; best-selling novelist Faith 
Baldwin; humorist Max (Dobie Gillis) Shul- 
man; publisher-columnist Bennett Cerf; 
famed sportswriter Red Smith; Rudolf Flesch, 
top authority on readable writing; noted lan- 
guage expert Prof. Bergen Evans; famous 
mystery novelist Mignon G. Eberhart; J. D. 
Ratcliff, called by Time “America’s No. 1 
craftsman in the field of non-fiction’*; and 
top ad men John Caples and Mark Wiseman. 

These famous authors have developed q 
remarkable series of textbooks, lessons and 
writing assignments that present — in a clear 
and stimulating way — what they have learned 
in their long, hard climb to the top. 

The School’s instructors are themselves 
professional writers. Under the supervision 
of the 12 Famous Writers, these instructors 
work with students by mail, just as magazine 
and book editors work with many established 
authors. And they spend up to several hours 



on each assignment completed by a student 
. revising, correcting, and advising. 

The Famous Writers School is less than 
three years old. Its first students are not due 
to graduate until later this year. Yet, many 
have sold their writings to such varied publi- 
cations as The Reader’s Digest, Redbook, 
Popular Science, True Story. 

To select people with writing talent worth 
developing, the 12 Famous Writers have de- 
signed a revealing Talent Test. The coupon 
will bring you a copy, along with a brochure 
about the School. Your completed Test will 
be graded without charge or obligation by 
one of the School’s instructors. If your Test 
indicates writing talent, you are then eligible 
to enroll in the School. You are, however, un- 
der absolutely no obligation to do so.
