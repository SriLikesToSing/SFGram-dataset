Lalominat entered his life in 
tears. Juni stood at the top of Fire- 
fly’s ramp while she made her 
farewells to the bears. The tall, 
burly, black- furred beings crowded 
around her, rumbling in light 
baritones their feelings and 
farewells. Lalominat was tiny and 
fragile in a pale yellow jump suit, 
out of place in the orange and blue 
world. 

After a final pressing of her head 
against one of the “bears,” who 
blinked his three-in-line red eyes at 
her, she turned and stumbled up the 
ramp. Juni faded back into the lock. 
At the entry Lalominat turned and 
raised slim, silvery arms over her 
head. The bears responded with a 
raising of arms and a final mass 
moan. 

Firefly judged this to be a propi- 
tious time to end the farewell, or 
merely took note that the passenger 
was aboard. It sucked in the ramp 
and the lock’s shutters contracted. 
Lalominat continued to face the bears, 
then lowered her arms and made a 
slight mewing sound. After a mo- 
ment she turned and approached 
Juni firmly. 

“Ship Man Junius Van Every? I 
am your contract servant, Lalominat 
Dancer.” 

Firefly recognized that as being in 
a local trade language. Adapting to 
the presence of a passenger, in 
translating it pitched its voice 
higher, adding overtones and under- 
tones in a crude imitation of 
Lalominat’s wavering violins, that 
Juni not mistake the translation for 
the robot’s own words. 

“Pleased to meet you, Lalominat 
Dancer. You may call me Juni. But 
you need not consider yourself 



bound to me. My culture frowns on 
binding contracts.” 

She could not frown. She had 
eyebrows but they did not move 
toward each other by a hair’s 
breadth. The inch-high green 
plumes, like shakoes at their inner 
ends, flattened against her forehead. 

“But by the last charge — ” Firefly 
substituted the code name “Bruin” 
they had assigned to her former 
employer, whose name Juni could 
not pronounce— “it was laid on you 
to accept responsibility for me.” 

Juni could listen to those blended 
violins by the hour, enchanted; her 
voice was wind over taut strings, 
silvery liquid over crystal. But his 
eyes were beginning to water and 
his nose to run. 

“I accept the responsibility, but 
you are free if you wish to go.” 

Did that blink and downward 
movement of her eyebrows indicate 
hurt? 

“I am only a dancer. If I have no 
patron. I cannot live.” 

The pain in Juni’s eyes and nose 
increased, reminding him that the 
orange-and-blue world of the bears 
had proteins incompatible with hu- 
man proteins. He was getting an al- 
lergic reaction to the dust and or- 
ganic debris Lalominat had brought 
in with her. 

And of course her own proteins 
were incompatible with his, else she 
could not have lived here. 

“If you will permit me to show 
you to your suite, we may continue 
this conversation in comfort. But 
don’t worry; you won’t be aban- 
doned. ’ ’ 

Lalominat’s eyes were streaming 
and she was wiping her mouth by 
the time they reached the suite he 



MOONLESS NIGHT

had assigned to her. Her silvery 
skin was showing a jaundiced flush 
and she kept rubbing her hands over 
her arms in a way that suggested 
itch. The ship was saturated with 
terrestrial proteins. 

“Put your clothes in the 

cleaner — Firefly will tell you where it 
is — and wash yourself, and you 
will feel better.” 

She made a gesture of assent and 
ducked hastily into the suite. Juni 
had given it careful attention. All 
organic articles had been removed, 
down to the decorative bug shells, 
and by hand he had flamed the 
rooms down. He had then adjusted 
the filters to incinerate all dust or 
other airborne organic debris, both 
entering and leaving the suite. For 
hours now that filtering had gone 
on; it should be safe. 

Musing, Juni went toward the 
control room. By the time he got 
there. Firefly was thirty miles up. It 
was a fast, light transport, five 
thousand tons’ cargo capacity, half a 
dozen suites and a dozen second- 
class rooms, designed for short ex- 
press runs. Normally Firefly carried 
a crew of three, plus stewards. It 
was now a month’s run from the 
human sphere and Junius Van 
Every was sole crewman — 
“midshipmite and bosun tight and 
crew of the captain’s gig.” And 
cook. Firefly's robogalley T>eing on 
the fritz again. 

“She’s even more beautiful than 
her visual records.” 

“A danger to you as long as she 
is aboard.” 

Juni dismissed the possibility of 
death by massive allergic shock 
casually. “Beautiful! She makes 
human girls look thick and 



clumsy.” 

Lalominat even had a human fig- 
ure, slender but attractive, com- 
plete with two small but delectable 
mammaries — a real rarity. Her face, 
too, was superficially human. 
Her chin was rather deficient and 
her lips thinner than he liked, but 
her blunt little nose — another 
rarity — was attractive. Her eyes 
were human but for their oval 
pupils, blue-green and very direct. 
The nose had only a single nostril, 
her eyelids met in the centers of her 
eyes, her hairline was odd, and her 
hair pale green with yellow high- 
lights. But none of this put him off, 
would not have even had he not 
been used to non-humans. Or far 
from home and his last human con- 
tact. 

“It would have been better if you 
had found some way to avoid the 
necessity of taking her on,” came 
Firefly’s toneless voice. 

A robot with a very complex 
program must have some standard 
to which it can refer instantly when 
some unexpected event occurs. A 
living being refers to its survival in- 
stinct. Firefly’s prime directive was 
to preserve Juni’s life, at whatever 
hazard. 

“If I hadn’t accepted the neces- 
sity we’d have been stuck with an 
unsaleable cargo and no consignee.” 

“Bruin” had seen a possible 
market for a shipment of house- 
sized water purifiers, but before 
Juni could deliver it, he knew his 
end had come. As he sat dying, he 
had spoken his last will. Lalominat 
was to be placed in the charge of 
Juni. If he accepted the charge, 
Juni’s consignment was to be ac- 
cepted by “Bruin’s” successors. If 
not, not.

GALAXY 




“ Firefly ? You said that I could 
speak to the Honorable Juni?” 

“Juni speaking. Firefly , visual 
contact, please.” 

“Oh!” The plumes at the inner 
ends of her eyebrows fluffed en- 
chantingly in startlement when the 
waterfall on the wall blinked into a 
holo of Juni in the control room. “I 
have refreshed myself, Honorable 
Juni. I await your pleasure. But if 
you desire low-gravity dances, I 
have not been in low gravity for 
years and am dry or desiccated — 
rusty,” Firefly explained in its own 
voice. 

“I would be enchanted to watch 
you dance — or to walk. It’s an in- 
expressible pleasure merely to hear 
you speak. But as I said, you may 
consider yourself free. You need 
not dance if you do not wish to. 
Consider yourself a passenger.” 

Again she didn’t frown. “But 
. .you have said that I will not be 
abandoned? A passenger. .1 have 
no money.” 

“There will be no charge. 
‘Bruin’s’ successors arranged all 
that.” 

“And. .if I am a passenger, 
what is my destination?” 

Juni smiled and made a vague, 
suave gesture in the air. “Why, I 
suppose you will go wherever the 
ship does. I don’t see how it could 
be otherwise.” 

For the first time she smiled, her 
silvery lips stretching a little, her 
eyebrows rising and their green 
plumes fluffing. 

“I have little choice about that, 
true.” The smile faded. “Honorable 
Juni. .” He was hearing her 
voice as well as Firefly’s translation 
and now it was very small. 



“Honorable ‘Bruin’ did not mean 
for me to be a worthless charge 
upon you forever. If my dancing is 
of no value to you, he expected you 
to sell my contract to someone who 
can profit by my skills. How can I 
live among those who do not value 
me?” 

“I do not mean to say that your 
dancing is of no value to me. 
Merely that it is not required of 
you. Your passage is paid. I am not 
a great admirer of the dance, but I 
know nothing of it. Perhaps I might 
learn, if some knowledgeable per- 
son took pity on my ignorance.” 
This time she smiled wholeheart- 
edly and made a descending slide 
on her violins, one of her most 
enchanting sights and sounds. 

“If my poor powers permit, it 
may be then that I can relieve you 
of some of your to-be -pitied ignor- 
ance, Honorable Juni.” 

“A moment, if you will permit, 
Honorable Lalominat. I see that 
Firefly is now on course for 
‘County Fair’ ” — his code for a 
local trading planet — “so I am not 
needed here. I will repair to my 
humble Shipman’s quarters that I 
may watch your delectable dance in 
comfort.” 

“Oh, but you must not salute me 
Honorable — ” 

“Passengers are always treated 
with utmost courtesy.” 

His quarters, comprising all the 
rooms of the rated crewmen, were 
just off the control room. His 
“suite” was almost as roomy as 
Lalominat’s. Juni nodded to her in 
the big visiplate there and said, 
“You may begin when you are 
ready, Honorable Dancer.” 

Visibly she decided not to argue 



MOONLESS NIGHT 



7 




the question of respect. She stepped 
back from the visiplate, nude, un- 
selfconscious in her silvery skin. 
She had no hair but on her head, 
no navel — at least not in her 
belly — and her rib pattern and hip 
bones were all wrong. 

That was the first reaction. The 
second was that she was breathtak- 
ingly lovely. Then she began to 
dance. 

. .Dance. .motion shattered in- 
to rhythm. .teeter of butterflies 
through air, flash of fish, leap of 
flame, and leaves in dying fall. 
Dance is these and Lalominat was 
these and water dancing under the 
wind and the dancing play of sun- 
Beams between cloud shadows. 

She danced because, like but- 
terflies, she could not move less 
gracefully, and because, like fish, 
she was supported by her life’s 
medium, this her art her life 
.... With eyes closed, she danced 
. .a flame leaping, leaves dying, 
waves chopping the light into 
rhythmic fragments, her dance was 
all these. .she was all these. 

Dance. .rhythm made manifest 
as motion. 

Till he had seen Lalominat dance, 
he had not seen Lalominat. 



★ ★ ★ 

Juni rubbed himself with silicone 
oil from head to foot, pulled a tight 
cap over his hair, and dressed him- 
self in clean synthetic clothing, 
finishing by pulling gloves over his 
hands. Entering Lalominat’s suite, 
he nodded to her at a wary dis- 
tance, careful to breath through his 
nose filters. She had directed Fire- 



fly’s handlers to put the food synthe- 
sizer in a convenient place. The 
food he had shipped for her at 
“Bruin’s” world was running low 
and he had had to buy another 
synthesizer at “County Fair.” 
There he had also looked up her 
home world. 

“You’re a long way from from 
home,” he told her. “A week’s 
drive for Firefly, and we’re pretty 
fast. Must have been longer by the 
slow ships in this area.” 

“My contract was sold twice be- 
fore I was given to ‘Bruin.’ Three 
trips in ships, but that was long ago 
and I do not remember how long 
the trips were.” 

The synthesizer had previously 
been adjusted for flavors according 
to a commercial table of equivalents 
for beings of Lalominat’s range of 
proteins. It produced a thick, pale 
liquid. Lalominat came delightfully 
close to taste, and her brows dipped 
downward. “It has no flavor.” 

Juni consulted his table and read- 
justed the synthesizer. “How long 
were you with ‘Bruin’?” 

“Many years, half my life. I was 
but a girl when my contract was 
first bought and I said goodbye to 
my family — collective — association.” 
“Were you sad to leave home?” 
Lalominat looked her surprise at 
him. “Yes. .to leave my friends. 
But how can one grow — make 
progress — if one does not leave 
home — the nest?” Juni was not sur- 
prised by this attitude; he knew too 
many cultures of too many species. 
He was silent in shock not at her at- 
titude, but at his own. He should 
not have expected her to react like a 
human from his own culture. He 
was anthropomorphizing her.

“With ‘Bruin’ I was very happy, 
though of course 1 missed my own 
language. He was like. .he was a 
protector. His shadow lifted fear 
from all small things. He delighted 
in beauty and the beautiful, espe- 
cially in living things. His collec- 
tion of dancing wings was large and 
marvelous, their wings of all soft 
colors. Their flights were more 
wonderful than my dance. Mon- 
Sil-Mon (her name for her home 
world) has nothing so light — so 
airy — ” She added words in her 
own singing language that Firefly 
could not translate. The ship said, 
“Neither your language nor this trade 
language has the words to express this 
concept.” 

“Oh, was that important?” She 
caught the change in Firefly’s 
voice. 

“ Firefly commented on your use 
of your own language.” 

“Why does Honorable Firefly 
speak to you in so harsh a tone? To 
me she speaks in a pleasing voice, 
one very similar to my own.” 

Juni gave her a forced grin. “I 
think I can illustrate it best by tell- 
ing of the explorer who took along 
with him no women but old or ugly 
ones. When they began to seem at- 
tractive to him, he knew it was time 
to return to his own race.” 

Lalominat laughed and clapped 
her hands against her thighs, her 
face animated. “But that is so hu- 
man! When our men are on long 
journeys on Mon-Sil-Mon, they 
begin to think of women all the 
time. But Firefly is not a woman; I 
do not understand. ...” 

“Simple. If I should begin to 
think of Firefly as human rather 
than as a machine, especially as a 



woman, I might well go mad. 
Hence, that crude mechanical - 
sounding voice, though Firefly can 
speak with an utterly human 
voice.” 

Lalominat pondered that, indi- 
cated pleasure at a flavor. “This 
means that you can breed away 
from your home? But it must be 
very lonely for you, then!” 

“Hence my precaution with 
Firefly’s voice. But of course I have 
a ship and can go home any time.” 

“Oh, you can own your own 
ship? I had thought you are a hire- 
ling, coming and going on com- 
mand.” 

“No. I go wherever the trade 
leads me.” 

Her expressive face registered 
awe, oval pupils flaring, eyebrow 
plumes fluffing, the enameled ridge 
that served her for teeth bared. 
“Oh, such freedom! To own every 
star in the sky! So great a dance.” 

She touched the back of his 
wrist. 

★ ★ ★ 

A day later Junius Van Every sat 
before the control board. To his 
right in the . visiplate flared a sun, 
the center of its ardent circle 
blanked out, its arms painted in 
light against the far hard stars of 
space’s winter night. Firefly was 
picking its way in toward another of 
the low-technology planets with 
which Juni usually dealt. 

He rubbed the back of his wrist. 
The silicone oil had helped protect 
him from the airborne organic de- 
bris, but against an actual touch it 
had not been very effective. There 
was still a rash there. Lalominat’s 



MOONLESS NIGHT 



9 




fingertips must still be painfully 
swollen. 

“So great a dance. ” 

Strange that she thought so little 
of her own exile — half her life. And 
she was so closely integrated with 
her native ecology, she could not 
breed away from Mon-Sil-Mon. 
Strange that she thought so romanti- 
cally of his freedom. He had not 
seen it as glorious, but Juni came 
from a wry, pragmatic culture. 

No. He was anthropomorphiz- 
ing. Why should it be strange? 

“Lalominat Dancer has just asked 
if you have been watching her at 
her exercises.” 

Jerked out of his reverie, Juni 
said, “Tell her no.” 

“I have already told her that you 
have been watching her from time 
to time, and that she was exercising 
during some of those times. I was 
not instructed to conceal that from 
her.” 

Fascinated for hours at a time, 
Juni had watched her move around 
in her suite, her silvery skin bare, 
light as a shaft of light, not so 
much walking as drifting like a va- 
grant breeze. She was as beautiful 
and as right as a natural phenome- 
non. .a glowing dawn. .a cloud 
over a mountain. .a jet of glowing 
gas soft against the glitterfrost of 
space. 

He cleared his throat. “How did 
she react?” 

"She was pleased.” 

Juni took a deep breath of relief. 
Firefly chimed and announced, 
“Planet signals us.” 

As he talked them in, Juni’s mind 
stayed with Lalominat. He’d been 
anthropomorphizing again. Modesty 
meant little between species, and 



privacy need not mean anything in 
her culture in any case. His own 
homeworld conditioning was ex- 
treme even for humans. 

“Honorable Firefly, is the Ship 
Man too busy to speak with me 
now?” 

“Not at all, Lalom.” Firefly 
came in low over an orange and 
amber plain. 

“This is not much like ‘Bruin’s’ 
world. Nor even like ‘County 
Fair’.” 

“It’s a frigid planet with 
ammonia-methane atmosphere; those 
are clouds below us. We won’t be 
here long.” 

“I am glad. Yet. .it is beauti- 
ful.” 

Hydrogen planets had always 
looked alike to Juni, but now as 
Lalominat’s wavering violin voice 
vibratoed delight, awe, wonder, and 
pure joy, he found himself respond- 
ing as well. Under the cloud canopy 
was a scarlet and crimson and ma- 
roon and murrey and terra cotta 
land that produced trills and trem- 
olos from her throat. Ascending 
slides greeted the closer view of the 
windsculpted land and its ground- 
hugging cities. 

Firefly cut her out of the circuit 
as Juni began to transact business 
with the locals and Lalominat soon 
grew tired of listening. She was 
asleep when they lifted off, but she 
had instructed Firefly to call her. 
She appeared in Juni’s visiplate as the 
frigid planet shrank below them, 
tousled and doe-eyed to watch the 
spuming behind of a world. Stars 
opened before them. 

“What is your world like, Juni?” 

“It was green when there were 
few of us. We made it gray, but 



10 



GALAXY 




now it is being given back to the 
plants and is turning green again. 
At the end of summer the plants 
turn red, yellow, and many as- 
sociated shades, before going brown 
and falling.” 

"Green plants! I have seen some. 
Some of ours are green. But most 
are yellow with a green tinge. They 
only turn green in fall. A lovely, 
soft, rich shade, they are, in sum- 
mer. Our airplants float in the air 
and dance to the wind. There is no 
world like Mon-Sil-Mon. Overhead 
the sky is pale blue and the clouds 
silver. The breezes speak; odors 
sweep our moods along with the 
wandering wind. Green leaves turn 
down after First Frost, then turn 
silver-blue on the ground; frost 
moss covers soil like spangles of 
silver tipped with ice. 

“Oh, Juni, there is no more 
beautiful world in all the Galaxy! 
All the brooks sing and the flying 
things sing. So too do the people. 
My people are the greatest chanters 
in our part of the sky. We are fa- 
mous for our chants. Mon-Sil-Mon is 
a poor planet, as you know, and we 
have as resources only ourselves. 
Thus we train our best and sell their 
contracts as entertainers across the 
stars. A chanter from Mon-Sil-Mon 
is required at any festive occasion 
on half a hundred planets.” 

"How about dancers?” 

“Our dancers too are good, as 
are our artists. We dance to the 
stars, and we create beauty out of 
many materials. But our chanters 
are our fame. There we have no 
equals.” 

"I cannot believe there can be 
any better dancers than yourself.” 

Her plumes fluffed and her eyes 



sparkled. “I only regret that I have 
not been able to lighten the dark- 
ness of your ignorance, Honorable 
Juni. .but I perceive that though 
you do not rate my dance at its prop- 
er value, you have recognized that 
it does have value.” 



★ ★ ★ 

Juni could not keep from watch- 
ing her, salving himself by the ob- 
servation that she had been pleased, 
had not objected. If she knew he 
was still watching her move lightly 
about her quarters, she gave no sign. 
Much of the time she was nude — 
always for dancing or exercises — 
and he never discovered the rule by 
which she clothed herself or not. 
When not exercising, she tinkered 
with the food synthesizer, her face a 
study in concentration, and cooked; 
she fumbled with garments of vari- 
ous human styles Firefly cut for 
her, and held long, animated conver- 
sations with the robot; or concen- 
trated with pouted lips over the an- 
cient jigsaw puzzle that had been 
aboard ship when Juni bought it. 

Much of her time she spent danc- 
ing or exercising. Her dances 
seemed to enthrall her nearly as 
much when she danced alone as 
when she danced for an audience; 
she danced till her silvery skin was 
flushed and her tiny yellow rosebud 
nipples opened into little blooms for 
the entrance' of a feathery tongue. 
She danced daily till near exhaus- 
tion. 

One day it occurred to Juni that 
all her dances were aspects of one 
larger dance that she spent, was 
spending, her whole life in impro-

vising. Lalominat sank onto a stool, 
wiping herself with a chilled cloth, 
and answered: “Oh, yes, Juni. That 
is how it is with all creators. One 
creates from out of oneself.” 

“The only creation I know any- 
thing about is technological, and 
that comes as much from the mate- 
rial and the problem as from 
within.” 

“Technology I do not know, but 
all other kinds of art come from 
within. Not only creativity, but life, 
in those who make living an art. 
Some say this is the greatest art, 
and these are those who best ap- 
preciate the other arts, dancing, 
chanting, sppll-weaving, and all the 
others. ‘Bruin’ was such an artist. 
His life was a chant. So is yours, 
Juni.” 

“Mine?” 

“Of course. Think how you have 
shaped your life, how you acquired 
this ship and with it freedom of the 
sky, at what cost. For so many 
years you labored to earn the 
money!” Awe entered her voice. 
“And now you are free. .you 
savor strange worlds as men savor 
wine. .the whole Galaxy is not too 
large for you.” 

A few hours later Firefly brought 
Juni out of his brown mood with an 
alarm. Three ships appeared on 
their detectors, matching course. 
Firefly turned aside and increased 
drive at Juni’s direction. The three 
turned to intercept, hanging on their 
quarter. For three hours he sat sip- 
ping coffee and watching them 
close little by little. In the end they 
sheered off, lest they be tempted 
too far from their own territory. If 
they hadn’t lost their nerve, they’d 
have had him. 



“Oh, Juni, who were they? What 
did they want?” 

“The ship, I would guess. As for 
who they were, they didn’t say. 
One of those minor races who in- 
tend to take over the Galaxy 
. some day.” 

Firefly ’ s voice, translating this 
for her, was no longer a simulation 
of Lalominat’s, but of Juni’s own. 

“What would they have done to 
us?” 

“Probably just killed us.” A 
shrug. “One of the hazards of star 
travel.” 

“You’re so calm about it. 
Weren’t you afraid?” 

“Of course. Next you’ll be say- 
ing there’s something wrong with 
me.” 

Her enchanting smile and laugh. 
“Oh, no. Oh, noTNever.” 

★ ★ ★ 

“You have become very silent of 
late, Junius.” Firefly’s metallic 
tones. 

“I have become very thoughtful 
of late.” 

“What is it you think about?” 

“Shrouds, mostly.” 

“I am worried about your health, 
Junius.” Prime directive lay behind 
its concern. “Will you step into the 
diagnosticon?” 

“I’m all right.” 

“You may be in good health, but 
clearly you are not all right. This 
morbidity is a danger sign. You 
should concentrate on healthy 
images.” 

“Such as Lalom’s dancing?” 

“That would seem to be a good 
choice, though according to my rec- 
ords, you tend to brood after watch-

ing her. Perhaps you should talk to 
her more. ” 

Juni had not been talking to 
Lalominat much lately and he felt a 
twinge of conscience. But he 
watched her more than ever, danc- 
ing of course, struggling with the 
food synthesizer, arguing with 
Firefly or teaching it her language. 
She dominated his thoughts; danc- 
ing with closed eyes, moving like a 
shaft of silvery light about her suite, 
oblivious of his scrutiny, or sing- 
ing to herself over her table, her 
voice like many violins, she seemed 
never out of his mind. 

She was so cool and light. Juni 
wondered what her body tempera- 
ture was. Slim though she was, she 
was strong and lithe. To hold her 
would be like gripping a warm- 
sheathed sword. He wondered if her 
lips were warm or cool. Though he 
had once thought them too thin, it 
would be delightful to kiss her — 
warm or cool. Or to fluff the 
plumes at the inner ends of her 
eyebrows. 

No. The first touch would bring 
burning, itching swelling; anything 
so intimate as a kiss would cause 
searing pain. 

Sex would kill her quickly (as- 
suming they could tolerate each 
other’s touch so long); as quickly as 
snake venom injected into her 
womb. Convulsions and death in 
minutes, it would bring her. For 
himself, death would be more slow, 
far more painful. 

Lalominat called him. 

“Juni? You have not spoken to 
me for two days. .And you 
speak to me so seldom these days. 
How have I displeased you?” Her 
violins throbbed in pain. 



Juni winced. “You have not. 
I — I just — ” He stared into the 
visiplate for a moment. “Wait 
there — I’ll be there in a moment.” 

For a moment he dithered, mak- 
ing motions toward the shower and 
the silicone oil. Then he darted to 
an equipment locker and snatched 
up a folded plastic sheet and hurried 
to Lalom’s door. Alarmed, Firefly 
spoke to him, but Juni didn’t hear 
the words. 

Lalominat awaited him, eyes 
large, her fists at her sides. Juni 
walked up to her and dropped the 
sheet over her, then put his arms 
around her. He squeezed her to 
him. Tears stood in his eyes. Lalom 
yielded, slim and steely against 
him. Her arms slid up and partly 
around him, hampered by his grip 
and the sheet. Juni couldn’t speak. 

Words weren’t necessary. 

It was real pain in his eyes that 
brought him around. Juni’s face was 
flushed, eyes swollen; his hands 
prickled, his lips itched and burned. 
Blinking away another kind of tears, 
he looked at Lalominat through the 
sheet. Her eyes were closed, her 
eyelashes gummed together; her sil- 
very skin was flushed yellow. She 
was beginning to drool slightly from 
the corners of her mouth. She was 
altogether lovely. 

It broke his heart to back away 
from her stiffly (his clothes prickled 
against his skin), to pull the sheet 
off her. Lalom immediately ex- 
ploded in a whistling cough or 
sneeze. It was not time for words; 
Juni staggered half-blind for the 
door, a stabbing burn in his lungs. 

Outside he dropped the contami- 
nated sheet and ran for his shower. 
By the time he was able to take 



MOONLESS NIGHT

notice of things outside himself. 
Firefly had run out of invective. 

Two days later they landed at 
Mon-Sil-Mon. 



★ 



★ ★ 



They all looked like Lalominat. 
But their attitudes were brisk and 
businesslike. There was no diffi- 
culty in transferring half of his 
Galactic credit to Lalominat Dancer. 
So in triumph another daughter of 
Mon-Sil-Mon returned. 

Did she recognize this planet as 
they approached, or did she need to 
ask Firefly what world it was? But 
she knew that she was home from 
the stars before he called her for the 
first time since they had parted. 
Firefly had informed him that she 
had packed only some of the clothes 
it had cut for her and a complete 
audio-visual record of their conver- 
sations. 

The ravages of that encounter 
were gone from her face, but tears 
spilled from between her lids as 
Lalom faced him. Juni couldn’t 
speak; he could only croak. 

Lalom made a curious formal 
gesture, tossing her hair forward 
over her face. Then she straight- 
ened, stiffened her back, and walked 
firmly forever away from him. 

Juni gestured wearily and Firefly 
lifted off. He had scarcely seen 
Mon-Sil-Mon. Was it a fairyland? 
Or just another low-technology 
planet off the star lanes? All he re- 
membered of it was a slim, straight 
back firmly receding. 

For a long time Juni sat staring 
through the visiplate into the end- 
less moonless night of space. ★

Something was re- 
ally bugging Carl 

but at least he 

wasn’t alone! 

1 

It was alive. And although it had 
just come to life, it had, as far as it 
was concerned, always been alive. 
It could not see for it had no eyes. 
It could not feel for it had no 
hands. It could not move for it had 
no feet. Yet it sensed around it the 
world which, as far as it knew, was 
black and humid, the texture of 
wood and plaster. Musty and dusty. 

It had never been young as it 
would never be old. In fact, it 
would not live for more than twenty 
minutes; and no one would ever 
know it had been alive, for it was 
not possible for it to live, being 
made of mechanical parts with no 
capacity for organic existence. But 
it did live by virtue of cir- 
cumstances no one could have fore- 
seen when the device was planted 
there behind the wall; by cir- 
cumstances so unlikely they were 
unlikely to ever occur again. And, 
in' fact, never have. But this time 
they did and the little device, which 
was the size of the head of a pin, 
was alive. And it remembered ev- 
erything. 

For that was its duty, and its duty 
was its purpose for existence. Re- 
membering the words. The precious 
syllables that came from beyond the 
wall; from the scarlet room with the 
mirror on the ceiling that it had 
never seen and could not envision; 



from the lips of beings it knew to 
be like itself in that they were alive, 
and yet different, far above itself in 
that they had created it. Beautiful 
creatures who spoke the words it 
remembered and revered, the words 
that were the whole point of its cre- 
ation. 

“My wife hates me. My kids 
hate me. I don’t blame them. I hate 
me.” 

It had no idea what the words 
meant. Nor could it know what the 
men who had planted it here behind 
the wall would do with the words it 
remembered. But, to it, the words 
were beautiful and precious, for 
they wanted them. They for whom 
it remembered. They who would re- 
turn. And until then it was to wait 
and to listen for that moment when 
it would again be held in their 
hands and asked to speak the 
words. 

How it knew this is a mystery. 
Perhaps it did not happen. But it 
explains what happened later. 

“Beat me, Sasha, beat me. Hard- 
er, harder. Oh, Sasha. Kill me. 
Destroy me.” 

Of all its memories, this was its 
favorite. The words went on and on 
and on. 

It was lonely. It had been alive 
for only three minutes but of course 
it had no sense of time. As far as it 
was concerned, it had been alive for 
years. They had not come for it. 
And there were no more words 
from the wall. And there had been 
none for a long time. In truth, the 
room beyond the wall was empty; 
gone were the scarlet and purple 
drapes, the mirror on the ceiling, 
the whips. The room beyond the 
wall was barren and dusty. Without 



16 



GALAXY 




even a mouse. And the men were 
never coming back. 

It could not know that. It waited 
and was lonely. It kept remember- 
ing the words, for that was all it 
could do; and although it did not 
know what the words meant, it 
sensed one essential thing about 
them and that was not in what the 
words said but in the way they were 
said; in the sounds between the 
words — “Oooo — ,” “Eeee — 

“Ahhhh — Over and over it re- 
membered and with every remem- 
bering it sensed the darkness grow 
warmer; itself lonelier, hungrier for 
the feel of its masters’ hands. 

It learned pain then. Want, first. 
Need. Desperation. It wanted to cry 
out but it had no words of its own. 
Instead, it cried, “Lola! Lola!” The 
words of a short, fat tailor named 
Kreisler, who was remembered for 
saying nothing much except by the 
device, which remembered him for 
saying what it felt better than any of 
the others. 

It was unlikely that Lola gave 
Mr. Kreisler what he cried for as 
she was an insensitive child of nine 
at the time; but the device was more 
fortunate. Its cry was heard by 
another which came to see what it 
was. 

Perhaps it came out of curiosity; 
perhaps chance. But it came. And 
something about the device made it 
linger, although it wits' not a crea- 
ture to linger long about anything 
that was not edible. It probed the 
thing with its antennae. It felt its 
warmth. It sensed the sounds that it 
made. And all these things together 
made it feel most peculiar. 

The device knew at once that 
something was near. Something like 



itself in that it was alive yet some- 
thing different in that it was not the 
creation of men. But the mere fact 
that it was alive filled the device 
with excitement. 

“Lola,” it said, “Daddy’s here. 
Lola, come to Daddy.” 

And it sensed the creature re- 
spond. It knew hope. 

Of course the creature knew noth- 
ing of the thoughts and the feel- 
ings of the device. All it knew was 
the warmth and the curious pulsa- 
tions that ran through its body, giv- 
ing it a pleasure it had never known 
before. So gradually it drew 
nearer — its pleasure the more in- 
tense the nearer it came — until it 
was atop the thing, its small body 
pressed tightly against it. And it 
was then, in a moment of bliss for 
which the world had no precedent, 
that the seed of whatever life was in 
the thing passed into the creature to 
become the substance of the crea- 
ture. And that was all there was to 
it. 

The device (how can one put it?) 
died minutes later. Not that it 
ceased to exist or ceased function- 
ing but that it ceased to be alive, 
was once again an inorganic piece 
of metal the size of the head of a 
pin lost forever behind the wall of 
Madame Scarlett’s School for 
Young Ladies. 

The creature went about its busi- 
ness. It died a few weeks later of a 
toxic odor in the kitchen of a young 
man named Carl Vandermeyer. But 
not before it gave birth to several 
quite remarkable offspring.

Carl Vandermeyer was a young 
man successfully employed as a city

planner. He was married to an at- 
tractive woman named Shirley. 
They lived in an impeccably clean 
apartment on the fourth floor of 
1234 East Thirty-third Street. 

Late one evening Carl was in the 
kitchen fixing himself a peanutbut- 
ter sandwich when he heard a voice: 
“I told you you shouldn’t have 
married that man, Shirley. I told 
you I didn’t like the look of him.” 
He looked around at the door- 
way, expecting to see a face in it, 
specifically that of his mother-in- 
law; but there was no one. The 
voice continued: “You could have 
had Freddie Stone. Freddie Stone 
thought the world of you. But no, 
you had to go and pick a pansy.” 
The voice was distinctly that of 
his mother-in-law, yet it seemed to 
be coming from far away. He left 
the table and walked back into the 
living room. It was dark. He looked 
into the bedroom. His wife slept si- 
lently. He returned to the kitchen, 
shaking his head. 

“Mother, Carl is not a pansy. He 
just can’t. .do it.” 

“Well, isn’t that what pansies 
can’t do?” 

He stopped in the doorway, his 
throat dry, and he listened carefully. 

Shirley was crying. She was 
pouring out her heart to her mother, 
who never missed a chance to as- 
sure her it was all his fault. 

He knew Shirley’s mother had 
been there that morning. She always 
came on Wednesdays and brought a 
large bowl of vegetable soup he had 
once deceitfully told her was the 
finest he had ever tasted. She al- 
ways said she brought it for him, 
the little boy she had never had. 
She had never said anything to the 



contrary. Yet now he stood in his 
own kitchen and heard her revile 
him as a pervert. 

How could Shirley have told her? 

He felt a little faint. 

He sat again at the kitchen table 
and it occurred to him that it was 
some sort of dream. But then he 
heard the voices again. Shirley’s 
mother was urging her to leave him 
and find a “normal man.” 

Suddenly he looked up and saw 
it — a small insect on the wall that 
he recognized at once to be a cock- 
roach. It was unlike any cockroach 
he had ever seen before but it was a 
cockroach all the same. It was pret- 
tier than most, for one thing. Bright 
and brown and shiny. But it had 
two little round things on its back 
that spun ’round and ’round like 
a. .he hesitated to say it. But there 
it was: the source of the voices that 
had spoken together secretly in this 
kitchen that morning, never intend- 
ing to be heard again. 

He picked up a newspaper. He 
went around the table. He missed 
the bug as it moved toward the re- 
frigerator. He missed it again as it 
disappeared behind the baseboard. 

Shirley came into the kitchen a 
few minutes later, aroused by the 
noise of her husband’s hammering. 

The refrigerator had been pulled 
out from the wall and Carl was 
down on his hands and knees rip- 
ping away the plaster, cursing all 
the while. She asked him what he 
was doing and he replied, “Noth- 
ing, dear.”

Carl was late to work the next 
morning. He had had little sleep.

He left his wife to explain the de- 
molished wall to the superintendent. 
He had not explained it to her. Nor 
had he mentioned the conversation 
with her mother. He had not known 
what to say about that. 

It occurred to him that he had 
suffered an hallucination, but he did 
not accept that idea; he had never 
had a thought in his head that was 
not level-headed. He could not im- 
agine where the cockroach had 
come from or how it had accom- 
plished what it had, but he was con- 
fident that he had seen and heard 
precisely what he had seen and 
heard. 

He did not get much done at 
work that day. Fortunately there 
was nothing pressing on his desk. 
He did have a peculiar conversation 
with a companion named Bartlett. 

“The old man has it in for me,” 
Bartlett said. 

“How do you know?” Carl 
asked, surprised. Bartlett and the 
“old man” had always been on the 
best of terms, at least whenever 
they were together. Privately 
Bartlett had few good words for 
him. 

“He knows I’m after his job. 
He’s going to get rid of me.” 

“How do you know?” 

“He told the chief architect to 
ignore all my suggestions on the 
Buford project. You know how im- 
portant that was to me.” 

“How do you know?” 

“He’s going to see I’m not in- 
vited to the mayor’s office next 
Tuesday for that conference on the 
Mayfield deal. You see if he 
doesn’t.” 

“How do you know all this?” 
Carl persisted. 



“I know,” said Bartlett. “Be- 
lieve me, I know every dirty word 
he’s been saying about me. But 
what I can’t figure out is how he 
found out.” 

“Found out what?” 

“That I hate his guts.” 

“Something you said?” 

“Or. .something someone else 
said. ’ ’ 

Carl did not like the way Bartlett 
looked at him when he said that. 

On his way home that night he 
tried to relax with the paper. It was 
not relaxing. There had been nine 
resignations in the city comptroller’s 
office that morning. No word of 
scandal. Just resignations. 

The Huffman-Jinks case had 
taken a strange turn. The district at- 
torney had accused the defense of 
tampering with the jury; the defense 
had accused the judge of racial bias; 
and the judge had accused both of 
them of telling obscene jokes about 
him behind his back. 

There had been several suicides 
in the financial district. 

When Carl arrived home, he saw 
the ambulance leaving the front of 
his apartment house. He stopped a 
neighbor to ask what had happened. 
He was told that Mr. Beckman on 
the third floor had tried to strangle 
his wife; Blanche, and she had 
stabbed him with a carving knife. 

“Such a nice old couple,” he 
thought aloud. 

“She was playing around,” the 
neighbor said. “I heard him say 
so.” 

“No, no,” another neighbor in- 
tervened. “He was the one who 
was playing around. I heard her say 
so.” 

Carl remembered Shirley telling

him the Beckmans had been married 
for thirty years. Very quiet, very 
discrete people. Each with their re- 
spective secrets, living together 
harmoniously. 

He found Shirley crying 
brokenheartedly in the kitchen. The 
wall had been repaired and there 
was a bill on the table. He did not 
look at it. 

“She hates me,” Shirley wailed. 
“Oh, she hates me so terribly.” 
“Who, dear?” he asked. 
“Janice.” 

Janice was Shirley’s oldest 
friend. Carl could not remember a 
time when they were not friends, 
and he had known Shirley most of 
her life. 

“What makes you think so?” he 
asked. 

“She said terrible, terrible things 
about me.” 

“To whom?” 

“To Dr. Bernbaum. What does it 
matter? They were so terrible.” 

Dr. Bernbaum was Janice’s 
psychiatrist. Carl did not argue. 
Shirley was as level-headed as him- 
self. If she used a word such as 
“terrible,” she meant it. Certainly 
Janice knew enough about her after 
all these years to know a few things 
that were “terrible.” 

“What did she say?” 

“She said that I didn’t de- 
serve. .that you. .that she. .ev- 
ery night she dreamed about. .1 
can’t. .can’t. .” 

“But how do you know she said 
anything? Who told you?” 

“I know, Carl. I know. Every 
terrible word she said.” 

And with that she ran out of the 
kitchen and locked herself in the 
bathroom.

Three days later Carl was on the 
phone with a Mr. Kravetch of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

“It is very decent of you to hear 
me out, sir,” Carl was saying. 
“I’ve been calling and calling and 
no one has permitted me to get this 
far.” 

“My pleasure, Mr. Vander-ah- 
meyer. We here at the Bureau like 
to think we are always responsive to 
the public. But the thing of it is, 
ah, just what is it you expect us to 
do about this bug of yours?” 

“No, no, no. It’s not my bug. At 
least, that is, there must be 
thousands — millions — of them by 
now. And there will be more every 
day. You know how cockroaches 
are. They’ll be all over the country 
in weeks!” 

“Yes, roaches will be roaches. 
But I, ah — ” 

“You’ve got to do something 
immediately.” 

“About your bug. .er, bugs?” 

“Not my — that is. .well, I had 
better tell you everything.” 

It had come back. The second 
night. While he was in the bath- 
room, in no position to defend him- 
self. This time he had seen it before 
he heard it. It told him that the 
most vile things were being said 
about him and his wife by the 
superintendent and his wife. It 
seemed he had forgotten to tip the 
superintendent last Christmas. He 
had listened. Not wanting to. But 
too fascinated to stop. 

It was awful. Those two quiet, 
polite people with whom he had ex- 
changed so many quiet and polite 
greetings. Vile. 



20 



GALAXY 




He had heard the bug out. And 
when it was through, it had left 
him. Once again he did not get 
much sleep. But by morning he 
thought he understood. 

“Understood what, precisely, 
Mr. Vander-ah-meyer?” Mr. Kra- 
vetch asked. 

“It was looking out for me, you 
see. Spying for me. I mean, what 
other explanation could there be? It 
wasn’t lying. I know that. It wasn’t 
making the whole thing up. That 
would be beyond. .decency. It 
was ‘reporting in.’ ” 

“The same bug?” 

“Who knows? How could I tell? 
But it was what happened last night 
that convinced me of the danger.” 
He had gone to the bathroom at 
midnight, deliberately, and had sat 
there, waiting. The bug had come 
to him and he had had the idea that 
it would have come to him no mat- 
ter what room he was in. It kept a 
safe distance. Told him that even 
more vile things were being said 
about him by Bartlett at the office 
and added a particularly crude con- 
versation between Bartlett and a 
young secretary. 

Carl had stood up very slowly 
and approached the bug. It moved 
away from him. He put out his 
hand. It started to run. He withdrew 
his hand. It stopped. He put out his 
hand again. It came to him. Came 
into his hand. 

“It. .loved. .me. In some 
perverse way. Like a dog. That was 
why it was telling me these things. 
Out of loyalty. It was deliberately 
spying on everyone around me in 
order to keep me informed.” 

“Isn’t that interesting,” said Mr. 
Kravetch. 



“Interesting? Why, it’s — ” 

Carl could think of no word to 
describe the horror he felt. 

“We wouldn’t mind having a few 
of those little fellows here at the 
Bureau, Mr. Vander-ah-meyer,” Mr. 
Kravetch said, laughing softly. 
“Save thousands on equipment, I 
can tell you.” 

“You will have them, Mr. 
Kravetch. All you could ask for and 
sooner than you think.” 

Carl hung up. What was the use? 
Kravetch was like all the rest. No 
one would listen. 

Very well then. 

There was no point in making a 
fool of oneself.

That night he tried an experi- 
ment. 

He gave the cockroach a small 
piece of cloth that had belonged to 
a beautiful young lady down the 
hall and that he had obtained at the 
risk of great embarrassment to him- 
self. The insect smelled it, or 
sensed it, or whatever it is cock- 
roaches do, and went away. 

An hour later it came back with a 
conversation between the young 
lady and a gentleman named Am- 
brose that was the most delightful 
thing Carl had heard in years. She 
was, indeed, everything he had im- 
agined her to be. 

He left the cockroach on the 
bathroom wall and went into the 
kitchen. He returned with a ham- 
mer. The- bug did not move. He 
smashed it where it stood. Its shell 
was very hard and two strong blows 
were required to crush it. It fell to

a splash of goo,

The events of the next few years 
came as no surprise to Carl. Not 
that he could have predicted them. 
Simply, he expected the worst and 
that is precisely what occurred. Al- 
though, oddly enough, not to him. 
Bartlett’s persistent animosity to- 
ward him put him suddenly into the 
“old man’s graces” — a position he 
had not occupied previously. And 
then, of course, he understood the 
situation now. 

He and Shirley were divorced and 
living together in a new apartment. 
She was expecting twins. They 
were thinking of buying a house in 
an exclusive suburb following 
Carl’s promotion to head of the de- 
partment. 

The remainder of their lives is of 
no interest whatever.

Franklin W. Bankes was the

guished education and no family to 
speak of; but the events of the past 
few years had been such that, when 
all was said and done, there he was. 

Late one Monday evening he sat 
in the blue washroom of the east 
wing of the White House, perched 
on the porcelain commode and read- 
ing a prepared statement to several 
small, shiny, brown insects on the 
wall. It began:

The therapy was a 
success, but the pa- 
tient — 



.LiOST among the mindless, direc- 
tionless mass of people on their way 
to work, a man in a gray business 
suit stepped off a bus and headed 
toward one of the innumerable 
monoliths of concrete and glass that 
rose above Manhattan Island. 

The sky was overcast and at no 
point did the clouds betray the posi- 
tion of the sun as it made its daily 
journey from east to west. The city, 
however, was sweltering from the 
greenhouse effect and the man was 
relieved when he finally stepped 
into the air-conditioned lobby of the 
building he sought. 

After checking the directory that 
stood by the entrance, the man 
made his way into an elevator, to 
be crushed with a number of other 
people. He felt the sensation of ac- 
celeration as the lift swiftly pulled 
its passengers to the twentieth floor. 
People came in and went out at 
each floor thereafter and the tedious 
ride to the next five floors seemed 
to defeat the whole purpose of the 
high-speed mechanism. Finally the 
elevator came to his floor and he 
stepped out, along with two other 
people. 

He found room 2507 and walked 
in. As the receptionist did not look 
up from polishing her nails, he 
cleared his throat. 

Smiling, she raised her head and 
asked, “Can I help you?” 

24 



“I have an appointment with 
Doctor Castellano. My name is 
David Trent.” 

She looked at her appointment 
book. “Oh, yes, Mr. Trent, the 
doctor is expecting you. Go right 
in.” 

He stepped into the office as the 
psychiatrist was putting a book on 
the shelf. Dr. Castellano was a 
middle-aged business-suit type, 
showing a touch of gray on his 
temples. He greeted the patient 
amiably with a handshake. 

“How are you, Dave? Glad to see 
you again. Have a seat, won’t 
you?” 

“Thank you, Doctor,” he said, 
sitting down. 

“Did you have any trouble find- 
ing the office?” 

“No, your new office wasn’t too 
hard to find. I see you have a new 
receptionist too.” 

“Yes, I shared the other one with 
a couple of other doctors but Cathy 
here is all mine.” 

“She seems like a nice girl. 
Good personality.” 

“Yes,” replied the doctor, “but 
she’s a lousy typist. Anyway, 
enough of that. There’s a lot I want 
to get done in this session so let’s 
get right down to business.” 

“Sure thing.” 

“Okay, Dave.” He leafed 
through his notes on the last visit 
while he spoke. “Last time we 
talked about a dream you have been 
having. To get us started, I'd like 
you to tell me again, in your own 
words, about the dream.” 

“Yes. .uh. .there’s really not 
much to it and very little ever hap- 
pens. All it is is that I’m floating in 
some kind of liquid, not moving by 



GALAXY 




myself but just drifting. I never see 
anything but I hear noises like 
gurglings or something and it’s very 
comfortable and warm there. 

“I’ve had these dreams about 
once a month, or every six weeks, 
up until this summer. Lately they’ve 
been much more frequent, maybe 
once a week. And lately, too, I feel 
very tired when I wake up after one 
of them. It’s as if I really didn't get 
much sleep when I know I’ve slept 
a full eight hours.” 

The psychiatrist was listening and 
he reached for Trent’s record, ob- 
tained from the National Population 
Data Bureau. Not looking up, he 
asked, “These dreams, are they 
pleasant or don’t you like them? 
How do you feel about them?” 

“Well,” Trent replied, “they’re 
more boring than anything else, 
really — just floating, doing nothing. 
And while they're pleasant and 
peaceful, there’s a little apprehen- 
sion associated with them as if there 
were something unknown, possibly 
something dangerous, about them. 
And another thing, usually in these 
dreams I sense a presence of some 
kind, close by and familiar, but I 
don’t quite know what it is.” 

The psychiatrist looked over his 
notes and was silent for a moment. 
Then he said, “Last week we 
started talking a little about your 
mother. You mentioned that she 
passed away recently. Right now 
I’d like you to tell me some more 
about her and the kind of relation- 
ship you had.” 

What does that have to do with 
my dreams, Trent wondered. What 
is this guy getting at? 

“Well, to answer your question, 
I guess that through my childhood 



we were pretty close. My father 
died when I was six and I was an 
only child. My mother never remar- 
ried so I was all she had. Money 
was never any problem though. My 
father left us quite a large sum.” 

“I see,” said the doctor. “And 
how are things going for you 
now?” 

Trent thought for a moment be- 
fore replying. “Well, financially 
I’m okay. I'm an electrical en- 
gineer, as your records will show. 
As for my social life, I’ve never 
been too — you know — too success- 
ful with women and I don’t have a 
girlfriend or, fof that matter, many 
friends at all. Most of the people I 
work with have their own families 
and all and I don’t really know 
many others.” He felt greatly em- 
barrassed and did not look at the 
psychiatrist as he spoke. 

He continued. “My mother and I 
lived on Long Island until she died 
and then I moved to the city. Now 
my life revolves mainly around my 
work, and I also go to school 
nights.” 

“How do you like New York, 
Dave?” 

“To tell you the truth, I don’t 
like it very much. The city is just 
so big. I feel insignificant. If I were 
to die right now, I doubt that any- 
one would bother coming to the fu- 
neral. Why is it that in a city of 
eleven million I feel so alone? 
There must be something wrong 
with me. I- walk down the street and 
see people, even the lowliest me- 
nials, who have friends, girlfriends, 
wives, families. Why am I an ex- 
ception?” . 

The psychiatrist seemed to mar- 
shall his thoughts. “Dave, you are

exhibiting a typical case of what I 
call the ‘Metropolis Syndrome.’ A 
great many people in cities like this 
one have the same problem- 
loneliness. You would be surprised 
at the number of people who come 
in here and, behind all of their ob- 
vious problems, just want somebody 
with an understanding ear to talk to. 
The city is big, overwhelming, un- 
less you become a part of it. That’s 
what I suggest to you — become a 
part. Your insecurity seems to stem 
from having no real focal point of 
stability, except possibly your work 
and that isn’t enough. Everyone 
needs people to give him some sta- 
bility, especially in this fast- 
changing society. 

“In your case your mother was 
that point of stability. She was the 
major center of your early life and 
therefore she represented security to 
you. This feeling of loneliness has 
been heightened by her recent death 
because to you she was a point of 
permanence in life. Your mother 
had always been there and it 
seemed as if she always would be. 
We all have these points of ‘perma- 
nence’ in our lives — until we’re 
rudely awakened to the fact that 
transience is the rule of the world, 
not permanence. 

“I think your dream sort of sym- 
bolizes this. What you describe in 
your dream, from both the physical 
and the psychological viewpoints, is 
what it’s like to be a fetus. Sig- 
mund Freud had a lot to say about 
this with respect to mother-son rela- 
tionships. There is often an uncon- 
scious desire to crawl back into the 
womb, where there is real security. 
Before you were born, you had al- 
ways known peace, contentment 



and security. When you were born, 
there was the gasping for air, the 
doctor’s slap, the fight for life. This 
is known as birth trauma and 
perhaps it’s the hardest thing to ac- 
cept in life. The start. From then 
on, there is pain and suffering — 
mixed, of course, with periods of 
joy and happiness. But sometimes 
we want to crawl back into the 
peacefulness of the womb and this 
is what you’re doing in your dream. 
Whether you’re remembering or 
re-creating in your imagination how 
it was, it doesn’t matter. But since 
you can’t crawl back into the 
womb, you must find some other 
type of security outside. Do you 
have a religion?” 

Trent fidgited uncomfortably in 
his seat. “No, what does that have 
to do with it?” 

“Well, I thought that maybe a 
church would be a good place to 
start. How about a club of some 
kind, a health club or some other 
special-interest club or lodge?” 

“I’ve never really thought about 
it,” said Trent. “It sounds like a 
good idea.” 

“I can do nothing for you. I 
never can. The patient always has 
to do it himself and so I’m leaving 
you with the task, within the next 
two weeks, of finding some group 
or club you’re interested in and 
joining. Okay? That’ll be your 
therapy. I’ll see you in two weeks 
then, and we’ll see how it’s turning 
out, all right? My secretary will 
make an appointment for you.” 

Trent stood up and they shook 
hands. “Sure, and thanks a lot, 
Doctor. You’ve been a great help.”

He awoke in a cold sweat and 
jerked to consciousness. He felt fear 
but had no reason to be afraid. 
Somewhere out there was a pres- 
ence, very near. He felt it. It was 
strangely familiar to him, although 
he couldn’t recognize it. Trent lay 
motionless in his bed while the city 
lights leaked in through the cur- 
tains. The room was still; the only 
movement came each minute as the 
digital clock changed its reading. 

The presence rapidly drifted away 
from his consciousness and Trent 
began to feel more relaxed. He lay 
motionless in bed and listened to 
himself breathe for a long time. He 
finally fell asleep. 

★ ★ ★ 

The next thing he was aware of 
was an acute pain in the back of his 
head. He awoke with a start and sat 
up, clutching the damp grass be- 
neath him. The pain of the lump on 
his head gave way to confusion as 
he became aware of the trees that 
surrounded him and the moon that 
shone overhead. Trent was in the 
park, sitting on the ground. His 
clothes were damp from dew and he 
shivered as he realized that he must 
have been out for quite a while. As 
he stood up, he realized too that he 
couldn’t remember getting out of 
bed, dressing and driving here in 
the first place. He should still be at 
home, sleeping. 

He wanted to see what time it 
was but he discovered that his 
watch was missing. So was his wal- 
let. He checked on the ground and 
found the leather case a couple of 
yards away, emptied of its cash. 
Now he knew why there was a 



lump on his head. He had been 
mugged — but he didn’t remember a 
thing about it. 

He made haste to get out of the 
park before another mugger tried his 
luck. He walked home in the dark, 
glancing behind occasionally to 
make sure no one was following. It 
wasn’t exactly the safest neighbor- 
hood in the city. 

★ ★ ★ 

“At first I thought it might be 
just amnesia or something from 
being hit on the head. But a lot of 
strange things happened to me after 
that.’’ 

He looked at the psychiatrist, 
whose expressionless face told him 
nothing. Dr. Castellano asked 
quietly, without any movement, 
“What sort of things, Dave?” 

“Well,” he began, “after that I 
started to sleepwalk. I would wake 
up in the morning fully dressed and 
with mud on my shoes, or maybe I 
would wake up miles away from 
my apartment. I would have run up 
bills that I didn’t remember any- 
thing about. I also checked my 
odometer. I’ve been doing a lot of 
driving in my sleep. But the real 
clincher was last Wednesday.” 

Castellano scratched a short note 
in his pad and without looking up, 
he asked, “And what happened last 
Wednesday?” 

“I had to go to Chicago on a 
night-coach flight right after work. 
It was a busihess trip. Anyway, I 
was pretty tired so I dropped off to 
sleep as soon as I boarded. The 
next thing I knew I was in my hotel 
room, and it was 2 a.m. I woke up 
and found my baggage all un-

packed. That plane took off at 7:09 
p.m. Now I had had a seven-hour 
lapse and I don’t know how to ac- 
count for it. This didn’t bother me 
as much as the next evening did, 
when I got a phone call from a girl 
who said she had met me on the 
plane. 

“Out of curiosity I played along 
with her and found out that I had a 
date with her. I met her and we 
went out together. She said that I 
seemed different than I had the 
other night and she told me things I 
had done and said that were totally 
out of character.” 

“Like what, for instance?” 

“Well, the fact that I even picked 
up a girl on a business trip is very 
unusual. I’m usually, like, you 
know, afraid to start a conversation 
with a stranger, let alone a strange 
woman. And my drinking was 
another thing. I never drink whisky 
sours but she said I’d had three. 
And I never drink heavily anyway. 
Then there’s my preference for 
foods. She said that we’d had lob- 
ster the first night but 1 despise lob- 
ster. 1 would never eat that insect.” 

Castellano eyed him. “I see. 
Anything else?” 

“Yes, there’s more to it. I went 
to sleep that night, Thursday, and 
woke up to find I was in bed with 
her. I was a little surprised but did- 
n’t say anything about it to her. 
The next morning I found out that it 
was Saturday — when it was sup- 
posed to be Friday. I had gotten up 
Friday, gone to business meetings 
all day, gone out with Louise — 
that’s her name, by the way — 
brought her up to my room and 
spent the night with her without 
even knowing it! When I looked at 



the notes of my Friday business 
meetings, they were unlike anything 
I normally would have written. The 
style, format and wording were all 
totally different from my own. This 
is all so crazy. What does it mean? 
I can’t just be sleepwalking!” 

Trent appeared confused and up- 
set. Castellano noted the change in 
his demeanor; he had been calm 
when he walked in. 

“Do you remember anything that 
happened during these periods 
of. .sleepwalking? Any dreams 
perhaps?” 

Trent thought for a moment be- 
fore responding. His mind was 
clearer now and he answered ex- 
citedly. “Yes, come to think of it, I 
do remember something. It’s very 
unusual for me to remember any 
dreams so there must be some sig- 
nificance in the fact that I had that 
dream about floating. I remember 
that dream because I always wake 
up disturbed after it.” 

The psychiatrist wrote down the 
words “possible dissociative neu- 
rosis” on his pad. He marshalled 
his thoughts to formulate a care- 
fully worded response. 

“Dave, sometimes when a person 
has. .ah, anxiety about a certain 
part of his behavior or his thinking, 
his mind is trying to reconcile two 
conflicting forces. You noted that 
your behavior during these ‘periods 
of unconsciousness’ was, shall we 
say, less conservative than the way 
you normally act. You picked up a 
girl, drank heavily, went out for a 
walk in the middle of the night. In 
short, you did things that you would 
never really do but had always 
thought of doing. 

“Now here’s where the dream 



28 



GALAXY 




ties in. When you lived with your 
mother, she was an inhibiting influ- 
ence on you. Of course you could 
come and go and do as you pleased, 
she couldn’t stop you. Yet she was 
there with her watchful eye on you, 
asking you where you had been and 
noting the hours you kept. When 
she died, the inhibition was gone 
and you secretly wanted to break 
free and do all the things you 
couldn’t do before. But part of your 
mind still had your mother’s pro- 
gramming in it and so ‘dissociated’ 
itself away from the rebellious part. 
In those dreams your conservative 
part was able to rest in your 
mother’s womb, unaware of, and 
therefore not responsible for, the 
things that your rebellious part was 
doing.” 

This idea seemed agreeable to 
Trent. ‘‘Uh, Doctor, I don’t know 
very much about psychology 
but. .1 don’t know, I guess what 
you’ve said has a lot of truth to it. I 
can see what you mean, for in- 
stance, about my wanting to do 
things and yet not doing them. 
There are lots of things that you 
hear about — people climbing moun- 
tains or hitchhiking across America, 
all sorts of things — that you might 
secretly want to do but would never 
seriously consider doing. For exam- 
ple, I could never have told my 
mother that I wanted to go skydiv- 
ing. She would probably have sent 
me to you!” 

They both laughed. Castellano 
replied, “I can assure you that the 
first time I went skydiving, I 
thought I was crazy. But you live 
through it and usually jump again. 
Have you ever jumped?” 

Trent felt embarrassed and 



smiled. ‘‘Well, I almost did once 
but on the way to my first lesson, I 
began to think, ‘What if I got hurt 
or killed?’ My mother would prob- 
ably have had a heart attack or 
something. So I never did it.” 

The psychiatrist shook his head. 
“I think we’ve found the root of the 
matter. Now comes the time to 
formulate a plan of attack. How- 
ever, I still need more data to be 
absolutely certain. Specifically, I 
need to test my theory on the role 
of your dreams in this matter. 
Therefore I would like to suggest 
that we run some EEG’s on you.” 
“EEG’s?” 

“An electroencephalogram. Sim- 
ply, we measure what has been 
popularly called brain waves. These 
brain waves are merely the patterns 
of the fluctuations in the measure- 
ments of certain physiological func- 
tions associated with the brain’s op- 
erations. Everyone has his own 
unique pattern, sort of like a fin- 
gerprint. In your case we would 
probably monitor your EEG as you 
go to sleep. Any unusual variations 
could show us the nature of the 
problem. The EEG will help us to 
determine whether your problem is 
physiological or purely psychologi- 
cal.” 

Trent was startled. “You mean 
there could be something wrong 
with my brain?” 

“That’s a possibility but at this 
point I have no reason to believe 
so. I just want to make sure — to be 
on the safe side.” 

Trent’s face grew serious. “Now 
I’m getting a little scared. I mean, 
this could be something serious.” 
“Really, I wouldn’t worry. These 
are only standard tests and we do 



THE EXCHANGE 



29 




them all the time. I’m sure that one 
way or another we can find a solu- 
tion to the problem.” 

‘‘Well, I hope so.” 

‘‘Dave, this will probably require 
a week or more of sleep testing and 
I would prefer to conduct it in your 
apartment, in your own bed. Con- 
trolled tests are more accurate when 
as many variables as possible are 
removed.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“In other words,” Castellano re- 
plied, “home is the place where 
you’re most likely to sleep as you 
ordinarily do. Variations might be 
caused by a change in the environ- 
ment.” 

“Yeah, okay. I guess that would 
be more convenient for me anyway. 
When do you want to begin?” 

“Oh, probably next week. I’ll 
have my secretary call you in a few 
days to confirm the date.” 

Trent got out of his chair. “Hey, 

I have to get back to work. My 
lunch hour is almost up.” He 
started to the door. 

The doctor smiled at him. 
“Okay, Dave. See you sometime 
next week.” 

Trent walked out. 

★ ★ ★ 

The EEG was to be conducted by 
two technicians from Columbia 
University. Actually they were 
graduate students already involved 
in sleep research and they knew Dr. 
Castellano at Columbia. Lori How- 
ell and Carl Pruett arrived at Trent’s 
apartment armed with two suitcases 
of equipment and an attache case 
containing a phone-link computer 
terminal that could be used with any 



of Ma Bell’s millions of children. 

Trent ushered them into the bed- 
room and they began setting up 
their equipment. He decided to 
clean and straighten the kitchen. 
Once they got started, there would 
be no free time to do the things that 
needed doing. He selected his most 
conservative pair of pajamas and 
put them on in the bathroom. As he 
approached the bedroom, he saw 
that they were almost ready. 

Pruett called out, “Mr. Trent, 
we’re about ready for you now.” 

Trent stepped into the room, feel- 
ing ridiculous. His pajama top 
sported pink turtles on a white 
background, while the pants were a 
hot pink. 

Pruett and Howell tried not to 
stare at the pajamas, which Trent 
had never before allowed anyone to 
see. 

“Well, I’m ready.” 

He surveyed the room and his 
embarrassment turned to amazement 
as he looked at the equipment. The 
pens on the graph paper were still 
and a mass of colored wires lay 
near his pillow. On a table were 
some bottles and medical imple- 
ments. The entire room had been 
transformed into a laboratory. 

Trent remarked, “It’s fantastic 
how all this stuff can be 
miniaturized. I’m really impressed 
at its mobility.” 

“Well, Mr. Trent,” replied 
Pruett, “the EEG wasn’t always as 
widely used as it is today. When 
the ‘cessation of neural activity in 
the cerebrum’ became the legal def- 
inition of death, it became neces- 
sary that this equipment be made 
portable and, above all, cheap so 
that local hospitals, emergency units 



30 



GALAXY 




and the like could have a quick and 
readily available EEG anywhere, 
any time.” 

Lori Howell motioned to the bed. 
“If you’ll sit on the bed, Mr. Trent, 
I’ll prepare you for the electroen- 
cephalogram.” 

He walked over and sat down. 
“As you wish.” 

She had already washed her 
hands and she began to work like a 
surgeon, Pruett acting as her assis- 
tant. He opened a book filled with 
diagrams and she prepared to apply 
the first electrode. She parted 
Trent’s hair at the back of his head 
and rubbed his scalp with a wet cot- 
ton ball. It felt cold to him as it 
evaporated. 

“What’s that?” he asked. “It 
doesn’t smell like alcohol.” 

“That’s because it’s not. It’s 
acetone,” she said, “to dissolve 
skin oils that might interfere with 
the transmission of electricity.” 

She was ready for the next step. 
“Saline gel,” she ordered. She was 
handed a cotton swab covered with 
a clear ointment. She applied it to 
the proper spot. 

“Now I’m applying an electrolyte 
gel to facilitate better conductivity. 
We’re going to achieve electrical 
discharges directly from your 
brain.” 

“I see,” he said, beginning to 
feel like a lab animal. 

“Now for the electrode,” she 
said. To a carefully chosen site on 
Trent’s head, Howell taped a metal 
disk with a wire attached to it. This 
was labeled No. 1. They continued 
the same process with the rest of 
the electrodes until all twelve were 
attached, including two on his 
eyelids to measure Rapid Eye

Movement. These were the most 
uncomfortable of all. 

Trent was lying in bed now, con- 
nected to wires dangling in the air. 
Pruett moved a monitoring unit into 
the next room while Howell briefed 
the lab animal with last-minute in- 
structions. 

“Mr. Trent, we’re about ready to 
begin now. All you have to do is 
sleep. We’ll take care of the rest. 
Our machines won’t be heard in 
here and you needn’t worry about 
those electrodes. Just think about 
how many women are going to 
sleep tonight with curlers in their 
hair. Electrodes are a lot easier to 
get used to than curlers, I can as- 
sure you.’’ 

He was surprised. “You mean 
you’ve undergone sleep-testing be- 
fore?” 

“Oh, yes,” she lied. “I would 
never ask a person to do anything I 
hadn’t tried myself.” What he did- 
n’t know wouldn’t hurt him, she 
thought. 

Turning to the doorway, she 
called, “Carl, switch it on.” 

Trent was surprised that he felt 
absolutely nothing. He had almost 
expected, when hooked to the ma- 
chine, that he would become part 
of it, part of an electronic being. 

“Blink your eyes, if you will, a 
few times just to see if everything’s 
working properly.” 

Under the electrodes, he blinked. 
Pruett informed her, “Lori, I’m get- 
ting some blinking here. Everything 
looks good.” 

She moved toward the door and 
turned off the lights. “Good night, 
pleasant dreams.” 

Trent returned her “good night” 
as she shut the door.

The New York Clone Bank had 
been in existence since 1995 and in 
commercial operation since 2002. It 
had enjoyed a great success among 
the more affluent members of soci- 
ety and had recently fallen within 
the financial reach of the upper 
middle class. 

Anyone who could afford the 
price could have a clone, an exact 
duplicate of himself, made from the 
genetic information in one of his 
body cells and grown and kept alive 
in the Bank. Whenever an organ 
transplant was needed, or quantities 
of blood, one’s clone would be the 
perfect donor, eliminating the pos- 
sibility of tissue rejection in trans- 
plants. But perhaps the most attrac- 
tive aspect of cloning was that with 
the imminent arrival of brain- 
transplant capability, immortality, 
or at least something close to it, 
would be possible. When one’s own 
frail body was worn out after sev- 
enty years, it would be possible to 
transplant the brain, the seat of con- 
sciousness, into a young, clonal 
body, exactly like the original in 
every way. 

The storage of clones occupied 
five floors in the Bank and space 
was being used up rapidly. Already 
proposals for a new building were 
being presented to the Board and 
something would have to be done 
about it soon. 

Dr. Harold Bennet was the 
Supervisor of Clone Maintenance, 
Night Shift. He resented the title 
because of the janitorial duties it 
implied. Granted, somebody had to 
oversee the care of the Bank’s sub- 
human population but he hated hav-

ing such a label on his resume. His 
hours and lack of contact with other 
scientists in his field were isolating 
him from the mainstream of re- 
search. But the job market is bad 
now, he reasoned to himself. At 
least he had a job in his field, 
which was more than a lot of his 
fellow graduates could say. Still, he 
was sinking into a rut in this job. 
While he would like to be doing re- 
search, he really wasn’t looking 
very hard for such an opportunity. 

Bennet’s mind had long since 
wandered from the journal he had 
been reading and he was startled 
when someone knocked on the 
door. He told the visitor to come in 
and Charlie Lowe, one of the tech- 
nicians, entered. 

“Doctor Bennet, something very 
odd has happened with one of the 
clones.” 

“What is it, Charlie?” 

“It’s hard to explain. You’re 
going to have to see for yourself. 
I’ve never seen anything like it. 
C’mon.” 

They stepped into the corridor 
and began walking to the Clone 
Storage Center, which occupied 
most of the floor. 

Lowe continued, “About fifteen 
minutes ago we got a warning sig- 
nal from the computer monitor that 
all sensory contact with Clone 
73-145 had been broken. This 
doesn’t necessarily mean anything 
since we’re having equipment fail- 
ures all the time. But when we, 
Greg Estes and I, went to take a 
look at it, we found. .well, I 
know you’re going to say this is 
impossible but we found the clone 
in an odd position.” 

They entered the anteroom to the 



Storage Center and put on the 
sterile gowns and masks that were 
always worn in the germ-free envi- 
ronment of the clone-tube galleries. 

Charlie continued talking as they 
entered. “You’ve got to see this. 
The sensory wires on the clone 
were pulled out and we found them 
in its hand.” 

They passed row upon row of 
clone tubes, three levels high, ac- 
cessible by catwalks. The dim light 
of the room added an eerie quality 
to the quiet galleries. There were 
seldom many people here and the 
atmosphere was hushed. The only 
sound was that of the quiet, auto- 
matic machinery. One could hear 
the gurgling of the pseudo-amniotic 
fluid pumps and the hissing of the 
oxygen system. The two men 
walked down the silent aisle, pass- 
ing tier after tier of floating bodies, 
all in the fetal position; human but 
mindless, only the motor portions of 
their brains intact. 

Thank God their eyes are never 
open, thought Bennet. No matter 
how long he worked in this place, 
he always felt a little uneasy walk- 
ing past the silent spectators, as if 
on parade. In his nightmares he 
could easily imagine the clones be- 
coming animate. 

They approached the clone tube 
beside which Greg Estes was stand- 
ing, writing on his clipboard. He 
saw them and called out, “Over 
here, Doctor Bennet.” 

They stopped a few feet away 
from 73-145 and Bennet saw the 
hand with the wires, just as de- 
scribed. It was apparent, though, 
that the wires were not being 
grasped by the hand but were 
merely caught on it, as if some 



THE EXCHANGE

movement of the arm had accidently 
ripped them out. However, there 
should have been no movement at 
all. 

Bennet let out a whistle and 
turned to the technicians. “That’s 
really something. How did it hap- 
pen?” 

Estes looked at him. “We were 
hoping, Doctor, that you could tell 
us.” 

He surveyed the situation more 
closely. “Well, it looks to me like 
a loose wire in the monitoring sys- 
tem somehow gave the clone a 
shock. It moved as a reflex action 
and accidentally pulled out the 
wires.” 

“I don’t think so. I checked for 
loose wires and couldn’t find any,” 
said Estes. He continued, “Besides, 
the chances are that if there was 
enough current to cause a reflex ac- 
tion, the clone would have been 
electrocuted. As you can see, it’s 
very much alive, perhaps more than 
we would like to think.” 

Bennet eyed him with disdain. 
“Are you suggesting that perhaps 
our clonal friend moved of his own 
volition? The cerebrum is destroyed 
long before artificial parturition, 
making thought or independent 
movement impossible. Look at the 
scalp closely. There are the sea — ” 
He stopped abruptly. 

There were no scars on the skull 
where the massive doses of acetyl- 
choline should have been injected to 
render the brain incapable of storing 
information. These doses were nor- 
mally injected in the frontal and oc- 
cipital lobes of both sides of the 
cerebrum but the cerebellum and the 
medulla oblongata were never dis- 
turbed because of their vital func- 



tions in controlling the involuntary 
life mechanisms of the body. The 
result was an organic machine kept 
alive by hormone injections and in- 
travenous feedings. The “thing” was 
more vegetable than human and the 
Supreme Court had even ruled as 
much on the matter, stating that the 
higher portion of the brain had to be 
functioning in order for the or- 
ganism to be considered human. 

Bennet whispered emphatically, 
“There are no scars. That brain 
could still be fully intact.” 

Lowe added, “In other words, 
we have here a human being.” 

Bennet turned sharply to both of 
them. “Not a word about this to 
anyone. Greg, get the EEG and set 
it up for testing everything as on a 
normal human, not just the motor 
portion as you would on a clone. 
We’ve got to determine if this brain 
is really intact. Charlie, get me the 
file on this clone. We have to see if 
there are records of the injections or 
not. Then I want to meet both of 
you in my office as soon as possi- 
ble.” 

Bennet headed for his office. The 
behaviorists would have a field day 
on this one, he thought, if this is 
really what it appears to be. What 
could a lifetime as a fetus do to a 
man’s mind? The implications were 
profound. 

Within forty-five minutes the men 
were gathered in Bennet’s office, 
having completed their tasks. Ben- 
net read the file out loud. 

“This clone belongs to a Mr. 
David Trent, who lives here in the 
city. It was made when he was 
seven months old and his parents 
set up a trust fund for its care here 
at the Bank. Let’s see, 2013 was 



34 



GALAXY 




when he was cloned and it’s now 
2049. He must be about thirty-six 
years old. What does the medical 
history show, Greg?” 

“Well, the checklist says that all 
the acetylcholine injections were 
given. The supervisor’s inspection 
sheet is marked ‘satisfactory’ and 
states that all the items on the 
checklist are complete. But 
wait. .the supervisor’s sheet is 
dated before the checklist. Some- 
thing must have been mixed up.” 
“Yes,” said Bennet, “and the 
clone might never have had its in- 
jections.” He sighed. “We may 
have a real legal problem on our 
hands.” 

“Do you think the courts would 
declare the clone a human being?” 
Bennet grew thoughtful. “I hope 
not. Beside the inevitable law suit, 
which could hurt the Bank financial- 
ly, we could be deprived of a good 
research opportunity.” 

“Meaning you can’t experiment 
on ‘human beings,’ ” Estes said. 

“Exactly. And just think of the 
possibilities. For the behaviorists, 
there’s the opportunity to observe a 
mind whose whole existence was 
without stimulation or rational 
thought. It would probably give 
them a chance to learn more about 
which aspects of behavior are 
learned and which are inherent in 
the human psyche. Also, from a 
neurological point of view, we have 
an opportunity here to learn about 
the way thought and neural activity 
are related. But all this depends on 
whether or not we’ll be allowed to 
experiment on the clone. The EEG 
is going to be a big factor in that 
respect so let’s get on it.” 

They left the office.

The sleep-lab technicians had 
been taking Trent’s EEG for six 
nights now and this was the 
seventh. Dr. Castellano was speak- 
ing privately with Pruett while 
Howell prepared Trent for the EEG. 

Pruett was explaining to Castel- 
lano the past week’s progress. “Ev- 
erything was' perfectly normal at 
first. We got textbook EEG’s right 
away and no signs of any organic 
disturbance. The pattern I have in 
my hand, pattern A, exemplifies 
this. Then at 2:04 of the fourth 
night we got this pattern, pattern B. 
Now notice that here he’s in Stage 
Four sleep, the deepest stage. Then 
suddenly we get this pattern from 
God knows where with mixed 
gamma and' beta waves. Pattern B 
has been occurring over increasing 
periods for the past three nights. 



THE EXCHANGE 



35 




That’s why we thought it would be 
good to have you look at it.” 

‘‘Has there been any equipment 
failure?” asked Castellano. 

“No, Doctor. We used three dif- 
ferent machines and got the same 
results on each. Whatever is causing 
this is in his brain and I’ll be 
damned if there’s anything about it 
in the literature. Granted, there are 
normally some variations in the pat- 
tern for different reasons but here 
we have a whole new pattern. This 
would seem to indicate a drastic 
change in the functioning of the 
brain — and that should be impossi- 
ble. The basic pattern just isn’t sup- 
posed to change.” 

“Yes, Carl. I tend to agree with 
you. By the way, do you have a 
tape recorder?” 

“Yes, we always do in sleep test- 
ing.” 

“Good,” said the psychiatrist. 
“I’m going to try to talk with him 
if and when the pattern occurs and I 
want to get it on tape. This should 
prove very interesting. Oh — one 
more thing — have you questioned 
Trent at all in conjunction with 
these B patterns? I’m particularly 
interested in any dreams he’s had.” 

“Yes, we have. If you look on 
the graph, you’ll see we had pattern 
B for a while and then it returned to 
pattern A in Stage Three sleep. 
Then it quickly went up to Stage 
One, consciousness. Trent told us in 
each case of a dream about floating. 
Do you — ” 

“Yes, that’s exactly what I’m 
looking for. He has mentioned those 
dreams before. That’s very strange 
and I can’t connect everything just 
yet. Somehow it all has to fit to- 
gether but I can’t seem to figure out 



how. I hope interrogation will help 
us.” 

There was a knock at the door. 
Lori Howell popped her head in. 
“Doctor Castellano, the patient has 
just gone to bed. Are you ready?” 

“Yes, Lori. Let’s watch the 
EEG.” 

They watched the patterns in- 
crease in amplitude and wavelength 
as Trent fell asleep. Everything was 
a firm pattern A. After two hours 
they had finished a pot of coffee 
and were beginning to get bored. 
Trent was just starting to go into 
Stage Four sleep, the deepest part 
of sleep, but now he was in pattern 
B. 

“Doctor Castellano,” said Howell, 
“here it is again. Notice those sharp 
peaks as opposed to pattern A’s 
rounded peaks. This is definitely 
pattern B. Do you think we should 
try to wake him?” 

“Not yet,” replied the psychia- 
trist. “I want to look at the REM 
graph.” 

He studied the graph for a time 
and then said, “Now that’s strange. 
He’s in Stage Three sleep and he 
should be dreaming but the lack of 
Rapid Eye Movement shows that 
he’s not. As a matter of fact, he 
wasn’t dreaming before, when he 
was in the period of light sleep in 
pattern A. Let’s — ” 

He stopped in mid-sentence. The 
pattern was changing back to pat- 
tern A. Trent woke and clutched his 
arm, sitting up quickly. He looked 
at everyone and then started to 
laugh. 

“Ha,” he said, “it was only a 
dream.” He turned to Castellano. 
“Doctor, you know that dream I told 
you about, the one where I was 



36 



GALAXY 




floating? Well, this time I tried to 
move and my muscles were really 
stiff, as if 1 had been inactive for a 
long time. Anyway, 1 started mov- 
ing in this sort of thick fluid I told 
you about and I felt something 
hard, like a wall. Then my arm hit 
against something flexible, like a 
rope or a wire. I tried to move it 
out of my way but it didn’t give. I 
hurt my arm on it and then I woke 
up. It’s the funniest thing.” 

Neither Castellano nor the techni- 
cians seemed to find anything funny 
about it and they looked at each 
other with surprise. The description 
of the rope or wire brought to mind 
the fetal umbilical cord but Castel- 
lano quickly dismissed the idea. He 
was beginning to question his Freud- 
ian fetal theory altogether. 

Pruett questioned Trent. “Mr. 
Trent, are you absolutely sure you 
dreamed this just now? The EEG 
shows that you couldn’t possibly 
have been dreaming at any time 
while you were asleep.” 

Trent was indignant. “Look, I 
know what I dreamed. Maybe your 
machine’s on the blink. You’ve 
used three already and — ” 

Castellano put a stop to the ar- 
gument. “Don’t worry, Dave, that’s 
unimportant. You were obviously 
dreaming something and perhaps we 
can find an explanation for the rea- 
son there was no indication of it 
on the graph. At any rate, I’d like 
you to go back to sleep again so we 
can collect more data.” 

They left the room and Trent 
started to fall asleep again. After 
what seemed like a long time, he 
slipped through the stages of sleep 
into the mindless limbo of Stage 
Four. 



“He’s in Stage Four, Doctor,” 
reported Howell. “Physiological 
functions are very low.” 

They waited impatiently for pat- 
tern B to appear and after a while it 
started abruptly. 

“There it is, Doctor,” whispered 
Pruett. 

★ ★ ★ 

In Bennet’s office three very 
grave men sat in heated discussion. 

“Look, this EEG definitely prov- 
es that the clone has a mind and 
that the cerebrum is intact. This is 
legally a human being, not a 
clone,” said Estes. 

Bennet agreed. “Yes, that’s true. 
But why should we be getting two 
different EEG patterns? It doesn’t 
make any sense. This is an anomaly 
that has never been observed be- 
fore. It could lead to a very impor- 
tant breakthrough in our understand- 
ing of the mind. We don’t know 
how spending a whole life in a 
clone tube — with no stimulus 
whatsoever — could possibly permit 
this effect on the EEG but we might 
be able to find out. We could very 
easily have stumbled onto some- 
thing truly important.” 

Like a tune- long forgotten but 
suddenly called to mind, ambition 
ran through •Bennet’s head. Here 
was the chance, the opportunity, the 
lucky break. He would be on the 
ground floor of a new breakthrough. 
He could make a name for himself. 
Hadn’t he majored in psychology 
during those pre-med years? Now 
he could put it. all to use. 

Estes had more immediate and 
practical things on his mind. 

“You haven’t thought, Doctor, 



THE EXCHANGE 



37 




what this could do to us. You know 
the laws against experimenting on 
human beings. This thing is legally 
human and it probably has a mind. 
Even if you could complete your re- 
search, you could never publish 
anything on it. You’d be arrested 
and so would we, as accomplices. 
Remember, there are still many 
people vehemently opposed to clon- 
ing. If this ever got out, there’s no 
telling what could happen.” 

Bennet thought this over and am- 
bition slowly retreated to the far 
corners of his mind. Finally he 
looked at Lowe. “What do you 
think, Charlie?” 

Lowe immediately responded. 
“Doctor Bennet, there’s only one 
thing we can do. We have to destroy 
the cerebrum — as it should have 
been destroyed years ago. If we just 
leave it, somebody else may find 
out about it and that could be very 
bad if -it ever got out — bad for the 
Bank and bad for us. It’s better for 
all concerned if we destroy the 
cerebrum now. No one would ever 
know. It’s the only way.” 

Bennet looked at Estes. “I 
agree,” said Estes. “We have to do 
it and quickly, before anyone finds 
out.” 

The scientist slowly nodded his 
head and sighed. “Yes, you’re 
right. It’s the only way. Bring the 
proper equipment and include a sur- 
gical drill. We’re going to have to 
drill through the skull. Then meet 
me in the scrub room.” 

They left and Bennet slowly 
made his way to the anteroom adja- 
cent to the main part of the Storage 
Center. He had just finished scrub- 
bing when Lowe and Estes walked 
in with sterilized equipment. They 



scrubbed in silence and then made 
their way to the clone. 

Bennet drained some of the thick 
pseudo-amniotic fluid from the tube 
and removed the part of the tube 
covering the head. Then he secured 
the clone in place with restraining 
straps. When this was done, he 
stopped for a moment to examine 
the bald head. 

“This is going to be a bit differ- 
ent than our normal procedure on 
fetuses. The fontanelles are closed. 
We have to drill.” 

Bennet was handed a cotton al- 
cohol swab with which he sterilized 
the scalp. Then he found the 
juncture of the frontal and pareital 
plates of the skull where the an- 
terior fontanel le had been. 

“Scalpel.” He was handed the 
scalpel and made several incisions. 
Carefully he separated the skin. 

Trent was floating, motionless. 
He heard strange, muffled sounds 
and felt something cold and hard 
touching his head. 

“Drill.” Bennet was handed a 
small, high-speed drill with which 
he made a tiny hole in the skull. 

Trent felt pain and tried to cry 
out. No sound emerged. 

Estes saw the lips move and 
called it to Bennet’s and Lowe’s at- 
tention. “Look, the lips are mov- 
ing, as if he. .it. .was trying to 
articulate.” 

“We’d better hurry. The drill 
may have hurt. After all, we’re not 
using a local anesthetic.” 

Bennet quickly finished drilling 
and was ready for the next step. 
“Acetylcholine.” A hypodermic 
was handed to him and he 
punctured the three membranes en- 
closing the brain — the dura, the 



38 



GALAXY 




arachnoid and the pia matter — 
injecting acetylcholine into the fron- 
tal lobes of both hemispheres. 

Lowe was watching the EEG. 
“We still have the pattern with the 
rounded peaks, Doctor. No sign of 
the other one. I can see the injec- 
tions beginning to take effect now.” 

Bennet drilled again and injected 
the acetylcholine into the occipital 
portion of the brain. 

Trent's mind rapidly faded away, 
out of existence. 

Bennet watched the cerebral lines 
on the EEG graph. The pens danced 
wildly across the paper as billions 
of neural impulses were scattered 
through the cortex. He stared at 
them, contemplating what he had 
just done. 

“Not a word of this to anybody, 
ever.” 

Estes and Lowe nodded in 
agreement. 



★ ★ ★ 

In Trent’s room a man in bed 
was slowly coming into conscious- 
ness. 

Pruett was watching the EEG in- 
tently. “Doctor Castellano, we still 
have pattern B but he’s waking up. 
He’ll be conscious in pattern B for 
the first time that we’ve ever ob- 
served.” 

The man stirred and opened his 
eyes. I’m here again, he thought. 
Why are they looking at me so 
strangely? 

“David,” said Castellano, “how 
do you feel?” 

He decided to retain his incog- 
nito. Besides, who would believe 
him if he told the truth? The clone 
spoke through Trent’s mouth. 



THE EXCHANGE 



“Fine, Doctor, quite well.” 

“Did you dream anything?” 
“Dream? No.” 

The clone tried to contact Trent’s 
mind as he had always been able to 
before. There was nothing there. 
Somehow he knew that there would 
never be anything there again. He 
was David Trent now and all those 
years as an unnoticed observer in 
Trent’s mind were finished. David 
Trent was dead. 

“Doctor Castellano,” said Pruett, 
“pattern B seems stronger now. No 
sign of pattern A at all.” 

Castellano eyed Trent curiously. 
There was something different about 



the man in front of him but he 
couldn’t quite put his finger on it. 

★ ★ ★ 

The next morning, briefcase in 
hand, a man in a gray business suit 
stepped out into the street on his 
way to work. Indistinguishable from 
the rest of the mindless, direction- 
less mass of people, he quickened 
his pace as he neared the bus stop. 
The sky was overcast with smog 
again and it looked as if it would be 
another hot, sticky day. He boarded 
the bus. ★ 



FORECAST 

Back in the days of H,L. Gold and Frederik Pohl, one of the names 
GALAXY readers always looked for was that of Cordwainer Smith. 

They didn’t even know who Smith was, then; only that he wrote some 
of the most provocative science fiction ever published — in GALAXY or 
anywhere else. He was the creator of the pinlighters and the go-captains 
and the Norstrilians and the Underpeople; of stroon and pianoforming and 
Space3, and all the other strange people and inventions in the universe of 
the Instrumentality of Mankind. 

Smith’s last appearance here was in 1966, the same year as the death of 
Dr. Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger — then revealed as the man behind 
Smith. But there was also, at times, a woman behind Smith: Paul’s wife 
Genevieve. She had collaborated with him on several stories, including 
“The Lady who Sailed the Soul," which appeared in these pages. And she 
knew him, obviously, better than anyone else. 

Next month’s cover story is “The Queen of the Afternoon,” a posthu- 
mous collaboration. From an uncompleted manuscript left by Paul, 
Genevieve has completed a story set in a time little touched on in other 
Smith fiction: the time of the Fighting Trees and the Unauthorized Men, of 
the Rule of the Jwindz and the origins of the Instrumentality itself. 

Also watch for “The Defector,” a unique story that ponders the kind of 
responsibilities a writer may fa :e if he becomes a Real Writer and creates 
Real Characters — by the leading Soviet sf author Olga Larionova. And a 
few other surprises that ought to please all of you.

ERDA: Yet while I sleep 
the Norns are wakeful: 
they weave the rope 
And truly spin what I know. 

Richard Wagner 
Siegfried, Act 3, Sc. I 

By definition there is no such 
thing as a fail-safe interstellar ves- 
sel. Spacemen know it, live by it, 
on occasion die from it. Starship 
technology is too radical, too com- 
plex; the vastnesses and emptinesses 
“out there” discourage dreams of 
ideality. Designers do the best they 
can, of course, but .... 

The engineering team responsible 
for TerrStshp Tristan at Gross- 
Europa Raumschijfwerk, GmgH, in 
Stuttgart, was talented, eminently 
abreast of the state-of-the-art. 
GER’s riggers and technicians who 
assembled the vehicle on-orbit were 
dedicated, first-rate employees. 

Nevertheless, during the star- 
ship’s seventh deep-space mission, 
Tristan succumbed to immutable 
odds — or so it seemed at the time. 
In midflight, while supposedly un- 
detectable by chance observation, 
an unheard-of occurrence took 
place: The ship’s dual-fusion to- 
kamaks failed simultaneously, with- 
out warning. One instant Tristan ar- 
rowed true, existing only hypotheti- 
cally as a flux of non-relativistic 
waveforms propagated at unthinka- 
ble velocity through equally 
hypothetical n-space; the next, it 
floundered, a bulbous-ended titani- 
um alloy cylinder in the pragmatic 
starlight of the Einsteinian uni- 
verse — not its proper element. 

A mere tenth-of-a-parsec distant, 
the nearest planetary system might 



as well have wheeled on the oppo- 
site rim of the galaxy. The sea of 
stars is dotted with countless islands 
but they are desperately far apart. 
Robinson Crusoe and brethren are a 
vanished species.

Senior Xenologist Grije van Pol- 
der came awake with a start. Si- 
lence, total darkness, engulfed him. 
He felt a bubble of fear swell 
rapidly, threaten to burst into panic 
as the whirling vertigo of transition 
churned his bowels. Then — sudden 
weightlessness. 

Pulse pounding in his throat, he 
fumbled with blind fingers at the 
restraint webbing of his bunk. The 
compartment’s sparse furnishings, 
as if by magic, rearranged them- 
selves in the choking, near-palpable 
blackness. Lack of gravity made his 
disorientation absolute. 

He moved swimmingly, bumping 
his head on objects unseen, and at 
last found the touch-plate that 
should have activated the sliding 
door. He slapped the plate time and 
again, clutching the door handle to 
prevent himself from drifting away. 
Nothing happened. 

Van Polder swore a wholesome 
oath. He was groping for the 
mechanical override latch when the 
door slid out of his grasp. Siridar 
Mashbravatan’s swarthy, bearded 
countenance hovered topsy-turvy in 
the hatchway, limned in the dim 
glow of an emergency lamp on the 
companionway bulkhead. It was the 
first time that van Polder had seen 
the linguist without his turban. 

“Whew! Thanks, Mash. What is 
it?”

“Blessed if I know. A power- 
room flap of some sort. Always did 
feel thse bloody space-buckets were 
death traps. Now I’m certain.'’’ 

“Easy,” said van Polder. The 
quixotic linguist, his companion on 
four previous field expeditions, was 
exhibiting his usual brand of ami- 
able pessimism. “Let’s hear the 
score before we jump to conclu- 
sions. Where are the others?” 

“In the lounge.” 

Rigged for deep space, the ship's 
freefall safety lines had been stowed 
after n-space transition when pseudo- 
gee enveloped the vessel. Neither of 
the scientists considered himself a 
“spaceman”; they negotiated the 
passageway with the inept clumsi- 
ness characteristic of most planet 
dwellers. 

All the members of the other four 
xenology teams were attempting to 
cling to something, if not to one 
another, in “C” deck’s cramped 
passenger lounge — exhibiting an 
array of fear-filled eyes and ap- 
prehensive, down-drawn mouths. 
Xenologist Gerda Malmstrom, 
leader of the five-member team 
soon due to be dropped among 
Plumma IV’s aborigines, glanced 
upward, blonde hair floating wildly 
bouffant in zero gee. 

“What’s gone sour?” demanded 
van Polder. 

“It’s a total power outage, Van. 
We’re. .dead in space.” Ice-blue 
eyes luminous with concern, Gerda 
suddenly reflected upon her choice 
of words. “It’s a helluva walk to 
the nearest filling station,” she 
added lamely. 

At that instant in Tristan’s power 
room the ship’s second astrogation 
officer hung back, watching with 



anxious eyes as the chief engineer 
and his deputy sweated over the in- 
strumentation displays of a curved, 
desk-like console. The chief was belt- 
ed into the control chair; the dep- 
uty was stretched out in midair, 
head-downward. Reading the dis- 
plays inverted was common prac- 
tice. 

“I just don’t get it,” drawled the 
younger engineer. “We have more 
than adequate plasma temp and flux 
density. Excitation levels and flow 
rates are holding up there in the 
green. How in blazes can one unit 
be down, let alone both?” 

The chief engineer’s grunt was 
caustic, his squint fixed, his expres- 
sion puzzled. “Sure, everything’s 
green,” was his terse remark. “Ex- 
cept that not one lousy gigawatt is 
outputting from either tok.” 

“But that’s. .goofy! It’s not 
possible.” 

“Read the power meters — and 
weep.” 

After a protracted silence made 
weighty by cogitation, the junior 
engineering officer tendered a 
suggestion. “Chief, what say we 
throw the Ops Manual on the view- 
er? We could reset, flush the 
lines, then start with Procedure ‘G’ 
and bring ’em back up from there. 
Who knows? Maybe the fuel’s con- 
taminated.” 

The older man wagged his head 
from side to side. “All seawater’s 
contaminated, not to mention that 
it’s also loaded with umpteen kinds 
of salts and other crud.” He ges- 
tured with a despondent hand. 
“Look for yourself. The 
malfunction-detector circuits are one 
thousand per cent green. Computer 
says all filtration, deuterium-tritium

extraction and pumping elements 
are running smooth, normal — and 
eating beaucoup amp-hours of pre- 
cious battery charge in the process, 
dammit! Uh-uh — we won’t find the 
answer to this one in any manual.” 

“B-but. ...” The other lapsed 
into frustrated silence. 

The astrogation officer chewed 
his tongue. At last he summoned 
the courage to make his presence 
felt. “The, uh, skipper’s itching for 
a status summary, Chief. The inter- 
com system’s out and I’m. 
What can I tell him?” 

“Tell him we’re working on it.” 

“I, er, doubt if that’ll satisfy — ” 

“Tell him, Mister! Now boogie 
off. And for Chrissake, stay out of 
our hair.” 

“Aye, Chief.” Tail between his 
legs, the astrogator boosted himself 
from the power room, dreading the 
thunder and lightning sure to de- 
scend upon his return to the conning 
bridge. 

Minutes later the ship’s surgeon 
appeared in the hatchway of “C” 
deck’s passenger lounge. Looking 
stern, he searched out van Polder, 
beckoning with a solemn forefinger. 

The doctor kept his voice confi- 
dentially low. “Van, better have 
your people gather together their 
outdoor clothing and stand by. Life 
support and the other essentia] sub- 
systems are operating on emergency 
batteries. I’ve advised the captain to 
seal off all unnecessary compart- 
ments, then stabilize the remainder 
at plus twenty degrees ‘F.’ We have 
to ease the strain on those bat- 
teries.” 

“ Twenty degrees below freez- 
ing?” 

“Yep. Got to. The ship’s radiat- 



ing thermal energy pretty fast.” 
“I’m aware of the emergency, 
Doctor, but — 

“Have them get ready to bundle 
up,” the medic interrupted with a 
tired voice. “Luckily you research- 
ers have suitable heavy clothing on 
board, which is more than I can say 
for we poordevil crewmen. We’ll 
just have to tough it out, I sup- 
pose.” 

“Doctor, our survival gear is 
stowed in the forward holds,” 
pointed out the xenologist, “packed 
and cartoned for paradrop.” 

“Um-m-m.” The doctor scratched 
an ear. “You’ll simply have to 
dig it out then. Or else be very, 
very uncomfortable.” 

“For how long?” 

“There’s no way to even guess 
yet.” 

The xenologist frowned. “Come 
on, Doctor. The others can’t over- 
hear us. Is the failure catastrophic? 
You needn’t spare me. I’d much 
rather know the truth.” 

“Catastrophic?” The medic 
sighed. “Just the opposite, I’m both 
happy and sorry to say. There 
seems to be nothing wrong with our 
fusion power system.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“Neither I nor anyone else does 
either.” The doctor arched his 
brows quizzically. “Engineering is 
in a quandary, hopping about, chas- 
ing their tails. How does one repair 
a non -malfunction?” 

Pondering this, the xenologist 
was startled’ when a ship’s officer 
caromed into view and came flying 
down the passageway. He checked 
his headlong' plunge, wide-eyed and 
out of breath. 

“Dr. van Polder, the captain in-

sists. .you come to the bridge at 
once. We, uh, have a. You 
won’t believe this, sir, but it’s. 
We have a visitor.” 

“A what?” 

“Please, I know it sounds looney 
but it’s true. Captain Dichter says to 
bring a linguist and w-whoever 
else. .might be able to help.” 

Van Polder regarded the officer 
narrowly. “You mean we’ve made 
contact with another ship?” 

“No, sir. Nothing’s around us 
for. .light-years.” 

“Then where, if I may ask, did 
this ‘visitor’ spring from?” 

The officer, a polite, tow-headed 
German, looked embarrassed. 
“Only wish I knew, sir. Please 
come with me now. If you don’t, 
the captain’s orders are to, uh, drag 
you.” 

The xenologist resisted an im- 
pulse to laugh aloud. “That won’t 
be necessary. I’m curious to see 
whether you’ve been exceeding 
your Schnapps ration or. ...” He 
cast a glance over his shoulder. 
“Mash, Gerda, come along. The 
captain wants us on the bridge. If 
what this gentleman has been telling 
me is true, it could prove to be in- 
teresting.” 

★ ★ ★ 

And it was. 

Utterly composed, the intruder 
stood erect, his back to the com- 
munications console. Seemingly he 
was a male Caucasian of indetermi- 
nate years. He wore the sky-blue 
tunic and ankle-gathered slacks of a 
watch officer. He was sandy-haired 
and dark-eyed, and he looked pain- 
fully ordinary in the dim light cast 



by an emergency lamp just above 
the conning console. His feet were 
bare. 

At first van Polder thought some- 
one might be having a bit of fun at 
their expense but he soon dismissed 
the notion. The thick silence per- 
vading the bridge, and the captain’s 
attentive mein, precluded practical 
jokes. There was something about 
the intruder that looked oddly out of 
place. Try as he would, van Polder 
could not pin down what it was that 
bothered him most about the vis- 
itor’s appearance. 

Then it registered. The man ap- 
peared to be standing firmly on the 
deck matting in all defiance of zero 
gee. Without velcro-soled space 
boots, the posture seemed unnatu- 
ral. 

Backed by a dumb-struck as- 
semblage of bridge officers, the 
aging captain did not take his eyes 
from the stranger, not even when 
the xenologist and his companions 
made their appearance. 

“He was naked when he first ap- 
peared,” Captain Dichter said in an 
unsteady voice. 

“Naked?” 

“As a jay,” assured the captain. 
“After a moment, when he got a 
look at the rest of us, the uniform 
kind of. .grew around him. What 
do you make of it?” 

Van Polder swallowed with diffi- 
culty. “I’m not. .sure. Have you 
learned anything else about him?” 

“Negative. You now know pre- 
cisely as much as the rest of us 
do.” 

“Has he said anything?” 

“Not a syllable. He just stands 
there and stares. ...” 

“He shouldn’t be able to stand,” 



46 



GALAXY 




said van Polder. 

“I. .know.” 

Studying the intruder, van Polder 
was fascinated, almost mesmerized. 
He clutched the grab-rail surround- 
ing the command pedestal until his 
knuckles whitened. “Mash,” he 
said softly, “why not try talking to 
him?” 

Mashbravatan licked his lips. 
“Glad to have a go if you think it 
possible. Wish I had a clue as to 
his, er— ” 

“Try Lingua Stella,” urged the 
xenologist. 

The linguist seemed surprised. 
“That’s rather an odd choice for 
openers, but if you say so.” He 
pulled himself hand-over-hand to 
the far side of the command pedes- 
tal until he was no more than six 
meters from the intruder, who con- 
tinued to regard them with steadfast 
aplomb. 

Mashbravatan addressed the 
stranger in carefully phrased in- 
terstellar trade patois, sounding 
somewhat hesitant and formal. His 
voice trailed off when the new- 
comer took a tentative step forward 
and closed his eyes. 

Suddenly the linguist convulsed. 
He clapped both hands over his 
temples and tucked himself into the 
fetal position, performing a slow 
tumble in midair. Then he 
screamed. 

As if released from a spell, ev- 
eryone surged forward to help the 
thrashing linguist. There were 
numerous collisions. Van Polder 
noted a laser weapon in the security 
officer’s hairy fist. 

The intruder opened his eyes, 
holding one arm aloft. “An audi- 
tory coding system, of all things!” 



he said, his Anglo-Terran pronunci- 
ation and diction a letter-perfect im- 
itation of Mashbravatan ’s. “How 
dull of me not to have inferred it 
from the physical construction of 
your. Forgive my clumsiness, 
sir. The intrusion was brief, but 
necessary. You see, I had no 
baseline from which to derive. Your 
discomfort will pass quickly.” 

Mashbravatan did recover fast. 
He managed to grasp an out- 
stretched hand and let himself be 
drawn back to the relative safety of 
the grab-rail. “Quite,” he said, 
looking dazed. 

“Ton are responsible for inter- 
cepting my ship?” asked the cap- 
tain. Even though bom and bred in 
the Hartz Mountains, Klaus Dichter 
had earned a reputation for classic 
Prussian efficiency. His blood pres- 
sure was obviously soaring at the 
moment. 

The intruder’s regular features re- 
flected dismay. “I do hope I 
haven’t caused you too much in- 
convenience.” 

“Inconvenience!” Color height- 
ened in the captain’s neck. “We are 
indebted to you for much more than 
‘inconvenience;’ sir. I’ve no idea 
what you’ve done, or why. But I 
must insist you restore our power 
system immediately.” 

“Why, you seem angry.” The 
stranger sounded incredulous. “Was 
it reprehensible to impose my pres- 
ence at this time, to pause and ex- 
change acquaintances? I’d hoped we 
might sit down together and con- 
verse like gentlefolk, perhaps share 
a cup of. .mead. Mead? No, that’s 
an anachronism. Bear with me — I’m 
rather new at this. Ah, yes; coffee. 
Coffee, then.” 



THE NORNS' LOOM

Although bombastic and proud, 
Captain Dichter was by no means a 
stupid man. Eyes narrowed, he 
cocked his head in speculation. 
“We’ll be delighted to offer you 
hospitality, sir, as soon as our 
power source is restored to opera- 
tion. Without power, our atmos- 
phere will become extremely cold. 
In fifty or sixty hours, when the 
emergency batteries are exhausted, 
we will all die.” 

“Really?” The stranger seemed 
genuinely perplexed. “One mo- 
ment. Let me assure myself of 
something.” He closed his eyes. 
“Oh, dear! Another foolish error. 
Again, I must ask your pardon. 
You’ll think me dreadfully incompe- 
tent. I had assumed that your mo- 
tive force. No matter. Let us 
have light and heat, by all means. 
There! That’s much more cozy.” 

Van Polder felt the tension ease. 
Beside him. Captain Dichter heaved 
a profound sigh of relief as glow 
panels lighted throughout the con- 
ning bridge and the life-support 
blowers speeded to provide a soft 
susurration of moving air. Gradu- 
ally pseudo-gee forces returned the 
group to the deck. 

Captain Dichter seized the 
xenologist’s arm. “By all that’s 
holy,” he whispered, “humor him, 
van Polder! Keep him talking. Find 
out how long he intends to detain us 
and why the devil he’s doing these 
things. I’m going aft to the power 
room.” 

“Right, Captain. Will you have a 
messman serve coffee and cakes in 
the astrogators’ lounge? Gerda, 
Mash and I will see what we can 
find out.” 

Dichter smacked his lips. “I pre- 



sume you’re thinking the same thing 
lam.” 

“About. .him?” 

“Um,” nodded the captain. “We 
seem to have here a being several 
orders of magnitude beyond our- 
selves, van Polder. Since you’re the 
expert when it comes to dealing 
with ET’s, I leave him to you. But 
use extreme caution, please.” 

“We’ll handle him with kid 
gloves.” 

Dichter blinked repeatedly. 
“Why, in God’s name,” he mut- 
tered, “did this have to happen on 
my ship?” 

★ ★ ★ 

The intruder declined both food 
and drink, insisting that his earlier 
statement had been figurative. But 
scant time passed before van Polder 
began to appreciate the other’s mas- 
terful penchant for dissimulation. 

During the past hour he had man- 
aged a direct answer to exactly one 
question and the xenologist intuited 
even that to be salted with erudite 
sarcasm. Displaying considerable 
charm, Gerda Malmstrom had po- 
litely asked his name. The stranger 
had stared at her with peculiar in- 
tensity before making a reply. 
“Skuld,” he had said with jovial 
emphasis. “Call me Skuld.” 

Van Polder’s suspicion of sar- 
casm was based upon Gerda’ s swift 
intake of breath, her moue of sur- 
prise. The name had also jogged a 
mnemonic chord in his own subcon- 
scious. 

Skuld had made much of the fact 
that they were research scientists — 
scholars, in his opinion, were to be 
held the noblest creatures in the 



48 



GALAXY 




galaxy — bound for field research 
among “our flowering younger 
species,” as he had put it. His effu- 
siveness reminded the xenologist of 
a holodrama scene he had once en- 
joyed wherein the hero delivered 
five minutes’ worth of nonsequiturs 
for the sole purpose of sidetracking 
three villains from participating in 
an incident crucial to the plot. 

Then after Mashbravatan had ex- 
cused himself in order to make him- 
self more presentable and had re- 
turned with a combed beard and a 
freshly wrapped turban, Skuld had 
without preamble begun speaking to 
Mash in what the xenologist knew 
to be his native tongue, Bengali. 

Like van Polder, Gerda had lis- 
tened in a state of perplexity, while 
Mash’s swarthy countenance had lit 
with joy. The pair had happily jab- 
bered together for minutes. 

“Your friend possesses admirable 
command over a multiplicity of, er, 
languages,” had been Skuld’s com- 
pliment. “May I ask your specialty, 
Doctor van Polder?” 

“Separating grain from chaff,” 
he had retorted, suddenly nettled. 

“Grain from. ...” Skuld had 
closed his eyes. “Oh, yes, I see. 
As similes go, that’s a most in- 
teresting one.” 

Not to be put off, van Polder had 
said, “Mr. Skuld, would you think 
it terribly presumptuous if I asked 
your specialty?” 

“Why, not at all. I suppose I, 
too, think of myself as a scholar. 
And I love to go good deeds — good 
turns, if you will.” 

“But, Mr. Skuld, we’ve learned 
nothing about you. Haven’t we the 
right to know why you have chosen 
to strand our vessel here?”

Skuld had chuckled pleasantly. 
“Oh, no, not Mr. Skuld, if you 
please. Just. .Skuld.” Nor had he 
given the least acknowledgment of 
van Polder’s direct question. 

When Captain Dichter returned, 
all bustle and curiosity, Gerda and 
Skuld were deeply involved in a 
philosophical discussion. Van Pol- 
der could think of no graceful way 
to redirect the conversation toward 
more practical ends. 

The captain listened for a mo- 
ment, wearing an agonized squint. 
He shifted his weight in the divan, 
throwing the xenologist a question- 
ing glance. Van Polder merely 
shrugged. 

“I am thoroughly intrigued by 
your mechanistic interpretation of 
the universe,” Skuld was saying, 
“and your place in it — your ‘des- 
tiny,’ as you put it. Isn’t self- 
determinism a product of Hu- 
manity’s total heritage? Consider 
the matter, Gerda. All that you are, 
or ever hope to be, is inextricably 
bound to an eons-long chain of ge- 
netically coded protein molecules 
stretching back to the first cellular 
creatures in your ancient seas.” 

But Gerda — practical Gerda — was 
not buying simplistic double-talk. 
“Are you suggesting that genetic 
conditioning, or my ‘heritage’ as 
you put it, makes me master of my 
fate?” 

Skuld’s lip curled. “To some ex- 
tent,” he replied, “ — when all of 
the complex variables such as the 
trillions upon trillions of minds, or 
wills, of your ancestors are taken 
into account. The last is all- 
important: will.” 

“I certainly didn’t ‘will’ myself 
into existence,” said Gerda. 

50 



“Ah, but didn’t you? I’m speak- 
ing now of the collective ‘you.’ My 
dear Gerda, do you imagine there 
would be a universe surrounding us 
had it not found existence within 
the minds — wills — of the myriad in- 
telligences that inhabit it?” 

“What? Why, that’s reflexive, 
paradoxical nonsense,” Gerda said, 
beginning to smile. 

“Dear Gerda, perhaps you 
. .have my number. Is that usage 
proper?” 

“You call yourself Skuld,” she 
said with a twinkle in her eye. 
“Where, if I may ask, are Urthr 
and Verthandi?” 

Skuld seemed especially pleased. 
“Excellent!” he exclaimed. “We 
discover the true characteristics in 
any species by examining their early 
mythos. I imagine you do the same 
in your work, my dear. Nor do I 
consider myself quite as clever as I 
did a moment ago.” 

Captain Dichter had heard 
enough. He sat forward and Har- 
rumphed! with no-nonsense gusto. 
“Look here, Skuld. May we discuss 
our status? We’ve been drifting like 
some abandoned hulk for several 
hours. Now that you’ve, er. 
Now that power has been restored, I 
intend to move my ship. We have a 
schedule tp meet, after all.” 

Skuld glanced at the repeater dis- 
play, a readout of the ship’s subjec- 
tive timing system. “Where, O 
where, have the minutes fled? Tem- 
pus fugit and I must run.” 

Mouth dry, van Polder rose. 
“Not without some sort of explana- 
tion, I hope.” 

Skuld smiled sweetly. He bowed 
fluidly to Mashbravatan, bidding 
farewell in Bengali. Then he bowed 



GALAXY 




again to Gerda. “Every success in 
your endeavors, dear lady. I wish 
you well.” 

Tipping his head to van Polder, 
he said, “My seemingly mysterious 
actions and my reluctance to answer 
your questions have valid reasons. 
Easy answers would be of no value 
and might indeed cause harm. The 
principal answer will suggest itself 
to you shortly.” 

Skuld bowed finally to the cap- 
tain. “Wiedersehen, Herr Kapitan. 
Lebe wohl!” 

Skuld shimmered. 

Then he disappeared. 

A shocked stillness pervaded the 
astrogators’ lounge. After an inter- 
val of pregnant silence. Mash said 
wonderingly, “Wasn’t that excit- 
ingT' 

Captain Dichter growled an 
obscenity. “You wouldn’t think it 
exciting if you had to given an ac- 
count of it in your mission report.” 

Ignoring the captain, Gerda said, 
“But who was he?” 

“He told us,” said van Polder 
dryly, meeting his colleague’s trou- 
bled eyes. “Skuld. When you men- 
tioned the other Fates, he seemed to 
be amused.” 

“I doubted that would get by 
you. Van.” 

“Of course it didn’t. But Skuld 
mixed his genders; the Fates were 
feminine in both Greek and Norse 
myth.” 

“I say, what is all this?” de- 
manded Mashbravatan, while the 
captain stepped back a pace, glow- 
ering. 

“Urthr, the Past; Verthandi, 
the Present; and Skuld, the 
Future — the Norns, who spin the 
destiny of man.” Gerda paused and 



looked thoughtful. “Skuld, the Fu- 
ture, I wonder if that’s significant.” 
Mash frowned. “He was simply 
putting us on?” 

“He sure as hell was,” replied 
van Polder. “That celestial con man 
toyed with us. He picked your brain 
at the outset, Mash; then Gerda’ s 
and probably mine and the captain’s 
as well.” 

“His German was terrible,” mut- 
tered Dichter. 

“But why bother?” asked Gerda. 
“What did he gain from all this?” 
With a shrug of his shoulders, the 
linguist surmised, “Simple curiosity 
about what might be flying past in 
the night, probably.” 

Van Polder grimaced. “That’s as 
good an explanation as any I can 
come up with,” he said, folding his 
arms. “We learned nothing, noth- 
ing; not even if he was truly 
aboard the ship.” 

“Or whether he’s corporeal at 
all,” put in Gerda. 

‘ ‘ Rubbish ! ’ ’ Mashbravatan said . 
“We saw him, heard him — ” 

“But did we touch him?” 

Wearing a pained expression, 
Captain Dichter clapped his hands. 
“Enough! I suggest we forego 
shadow-chasing and get on with the 
mission. There will be plenty of 
time later for conjecture.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The captain’s basso rumbled with 
authority. “Transition in fifty sec- 
onds. Will it be necessary to re- 
compute, Astrogator?” 

“Negative, sir. We’re only about 
seven lights away. Our drift during 
shutdown was negligible. Request 
four or five minutes for sighting and 
re-alignment.” 



THE NORNS' LOOM 



51 




“Granted, Astrogator. Carry 
on.” In an aside Dichter invited the 
three research scientists to remain 
on the conning deck. “I’d like a 
word with you once we’re under 
way.” 

“Certainly, Captain.” 

A warning klaxon bellowed, 
flooding the bridge with sound. 
Seconds dribbled from a flashing 
digital display above the 
helmsman’s console. On the desig- 
nated track, Tristan went irrational. 
Van Polder felt the familiar gut- 
wrench queasiness of transition, the 
momentary “elevator effect” of 
partial weightlessness. 

“Normality” returned; Tristan’s 
thousands of deadweight metric tons 
now floated in the multidimensional 
neverland of n-space. 

The larger astrogation tank lit up 
into a chaotic jumble of fiducial 
marks and esoteric symbology. 
Speckled throughout the tank were 
lambent, stereoperspective discs — 
star analogs — transduced from non- 
relativistic energies impinging at 
many times the speed of light upon 
the starship’s external sensors. The 
astrogation reticule crept slowly 
through some five degrees of arc as 
the computer. sought its objective. It 
locked in on a smallish circle of 
violet light — the primary of Plumma 
whence Gerda and her team were 
bound, an insignificant fifteenth- 
magnitude star as viewed from dis- 
tant Sol. 

Even as they watched, the violet 
circle in the reticule’s crosshairs 
swelled, lightening in color to dark 
blue. 

A scratchy voice from somewhere 
behind van Polder asked, “Now 
what in hell caused that?” 



Captain Dichter stiffened. “As- 
trogator, check your alignment ref- 
erence frame, please.” He sounded 
perturbed. 

“Aye, sir; checking.” The 
officer bent over his console, 
punching one code after another. 
“Verified, Captain. Major sighting 
reference is Rho Puppis. N- spectral 
analysis confirmed. Apparent in- 
cluded angle five-point-seven-oh- 
nine-three degrees correlates to our 
objective. Hey, Skipper, some- 
thing’s wrong!” 

“My God!” Dichter jerked him- 
self to his feet. Gingerly he stepped 
down from the command pedestal, 
staring into the astrogation tank as 
if hypnotized. 

The reticule pinpointed a balloon- 
ing disc that was turning light blue. 
It faded slowly to pastel gray, fill- 
ing the reticule’s inner concentric 
rings. 

“What is it?” asked van Polder,

THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR 



1 here are times when I am cer- 
tain I have lost my senses. I hear 
put forward, by supposedly sane 
and rational people, propositions so 
mindless that I doubt my sanity. 
Could I be that wrong? 

One such experience happened 
while listening to the President’s 
energy message to the people. Here 
was the President of the United 
States, a man who presumably can 
obtain the best advice from the 
world’s most intelligent and in- 
formed people; and what I heard 
came out as nonsense. 

After further study it still seems 
nonsense. 

The best summary I’ve heard is 
quoted in Access to Energy, an ex- 
cellent newsletter published by Dr. 



Petr Beckmann of the University of 
Colorado ($9.00 year, Box 2298, 
Boulder, Col. 80306; payment must 
accompany subscription order — 

highly recommended). In Beck- 
mann’s latest there is a quote from 
an independent oil producer: “I 
find it; I develop it; I operate it; I 
take all the risks; I get $2 .50/bbl. ; 
the government gets $8.25/bbl and 
the price to the consumer goes up.” 

That’s an energy policy? 

Now, were these enormous new 
taxes — the greatest tax increase in 
US peacetime history — to be 
applied to development of new 
energy resources, we would be in- 
volved in a sensible debate: should 
energy research be directed by the 
government, or left to private indus-

try? One might rationally take either 
side of the issue, and the disagree- 
ment would be “legitimate;” 1 
would not have that mind-boggling 
sensation of hearing what seems 
nonsense. 

But — in the President’s speech 
for the better part of an hour, re- 
search was mentioned precisely 
once, and then only in passing. Fu- 
sion was mentioned not at all. 
Neither were Space Power Satel- 
lites. There was plenty talk of 
“windfall profits” to the oil com- 
panies but very little of why many 
major oil companies love the new 
policy: it eliminates all hope of 
competition. There was nothing 
about alternate fuel sources, recla- 
mation of sewage, or agricultural 
research; nothing about geopres- 
surized domes (of which more lat- 
er). 

Out in the fusion research 
laboratories they’re laying off scien- 
tists as I write this. 

President Carter has declared war 
on the energy crisis, and his first 
marching order was to disband the 
armored divisions. 

★ ★ ★ 

So what might be a sensible 
energy policy? Understand, I don’t 
claim to be the world’s greatest ex- 
pert on the subject; perhaps it’s pos- 
sible that Carter and Company can 
refute what I’m saying; but I do 
claim that what I propose makes 
sense, and on the evidence mine 
appears a better policy than the one 
we seem doomed to adopt — and I 
have heard no refutation, not even a 
discussion, from the “experts.” 

I say this up front because re- 

THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR 



cently I received an amazing letter 
from a professor in a state college. 
He had, it seems, been given a 
copy of one of my columns, and he 
wrote to tell me that he intended to 
use me as “an example of those 
who hold the view that since 
technology got us into our ecologi- 
cal dilemma, it can get us out of 
it.” Then followed a rather imperi- 
ous demand for my qualifications as 
an expert. I gather that creeping 
credentialism abounds at the profes- 
sor’s institution. 

He signed himself as an 
“ecologist”. That’s just as well, 

since he can hardly call himself a 
logician. I cannot think where I 
have ever said anything as amazing 
as that\ I don’t accept that 

“technology got us into our ecolog- 
ical dilemma,” and I certainly don’t 
accept his syllogism. I tried to tell 
him in my reply that I am willing to 
discuss specific problems and 

specific technologies, but that evi- 
dently did not appeal to him, for he 
never answered. Perhaps I do not 
have the right credentials to engage 
in correspondence with an 

“ecologist.” 

★ ★ ★ 

The first job in forming an 
energy policy is to look at time 
spans and constraints. It makes no 
sense to put together a policy which 
insures a crunch a few years 
downstream. 

Democracies have no very credit- 
able record of planning for the fu- 
ture. Aristocracies and monarchies 
have sometimes worried about the 
next generation, simply because it’s 
likely that the children of the ruling 

55 




class will have to live with the 
problems created by present 
governors. One might think this 
would apply to democracies as well, 
but so far that’s been rare. 

Yet: energy policy affects the fu- 
ture in an all-too-real sense. Unless 
we are willing to face massive cut- 
backs in our real standard of living, 
we must prepare for the future; and 
by “we” I mean us, those my age 
and those just coming of voting 
age, and by “the future” I mean 
our future. 

It’s a well-known fact that there 
was a “baby boom” in the late for- 
ties and early fifties. As a result we 
have a work force that’s fairly large 
compared to the total population. 
This has resulted in relatively high 
unemployment among the young 
unskilled; but it has also enabled the 
work force to support everyone 
else. The Social Security program 
was never an actual insurance sys- 
tem; it always frankly depended on 
requiring the young workers to sup- 
port the aged and retired — and even 
with the large numbers entering the 
work force over the past few years, 
Social Security is bankrupt. 

What happens when the “baby- 
boom” children, those born between 
1945 and 1955, retire? Who will 
support them? You see, the fertility 
rate in the US is quite low, below 
replacement; and for the next 
twenty years at least there cannot be 
much increase in the size of the 
work force. Even were we to have a 
new “baby boom” the effects on 
the work force would not be seen 
for nearly twenty years — and there 
are fallout detriments to a sudden 
increase in population. One suspects 
that a campaign to increase the 

56 



number of children per US family 
would not be an optimum solution. 

But if the work force stays con- 
stant or decreases, and the number 
of retired greatly increases, what is 
the result? We’ve seen it already; 
people don’t retire, they just get 
poor. Even ownership of a home 
does little to cushion the blow: 
property taxes are far higher than 
the mortgage payments, and Social 
Security and retirement income gen- 
erally can’t meet the tax bill and 
leave anything left over. 

So: either the productivity per 
worker increases, or we have a 
hefty decline in real income for an 
increasingly large part of the 
population — and precisely that por- 
tion of the population which has 
time for political activities, and has 
been around long enough to have 
some idea of how the political sys- 
tem works. 

What will the result of that be? 
There are a number of possibilities, 
none very pleasant. Probably the 
least unpleasant would be a 
backlash against “ecologists” and 
“concerned” people, the scrapping 
of conservation programs, and a 
crash program to increase productiv- 
ity at any expense. 

The alternative to waiting for the 
crunch is to plan for increased 
worker productivity: and that means 
to expand the energy supply. The 
productivity of the work force has 
always been dependent on the 
availability and price of energy. 

Meanwhile, across the world 
there is a rising tide of demand: 
what, when I was in college, the 
professors called “the revolution of 
rising expectations.” Some of those 
foreign beggars are actually de- 



GALAXY 




manding enough to eat! In many 
“developing” countries there is ac- 
tually an expectation of develop- 
ment. 

I suggest that it is much harder to 
raise real per capita income from 
$100 a year to $150 than to raise it 
from $5000 to $7500; that if it is to 
be done, it is likely to be done only 
with technology; and that takes 
energy. (It also makes it likely that 
the Western nations will grow even 
wealthier with respect to the poor 
ones; but see Matthew and the par- 
able of the laborers in the vineyard 
on that. I should have thought it 
takes a twisted logic indeed to pre- 
fer an income of $100 yearly while 
the West stays put, than to have 
50 percent more while the West does 
the same.) 

Well, all right; we’ll have to have 
energy; but can’t conservation do it? 
Or windmills? Or tide? Or magic? 

No one seriously thinks so, and 
few say it except some “ecology” 
publications more dedicated to 
ideology than fact. 

But can’t we go back to the land? 
Conserve? 

How? The productive land is in 
production; sending any large part 
of the population “back to the 
land” would simply reduce the 
amount of food available. There is 
land that is not economic to farm; 
but to suggest that we “retire” our 
poor and aged onto inadequate 
farmland requires a callous disre- 
gard for human values almost be- 
yond belief. Subsistence farming on 
poor land is appealing only to hope- 
less romantics who haven’t tried it. 
There may be a few who like that 
sort of thing; but politically it’s an 
impossible solution, requiring 



armies and police and the abroga- 
tion of democracy. 

No. To provide for the non- 
working among us, both unem- 
ployed and aged, we need higher 
productivity; and that requires 
energy. 

For the near term — say between 
now and the year 2000 — there are 
only two certain sources of energy 
in the quantities we will need. 

Coal and nuclear — and perhaps, 
just perhaps, a third, one just dis- 
covered which does not yet figure 
into anybody’s energy estimates. 

Coal has problems. For each 
1000 megaWatts of coal-fired elec- 
trical plant, there is created each 
second: 600 pounds of CO 2 , ten 
pounds of sulfur dioxide, 30 pounds 
of bottom and fly ash and a lot of 
other stuff. 

If you prefer annual figures, 
that’s nine million tons of CO 2 , 
157,000 tons of SO 2 , and 474,000 
tons of ashes; not to mention a million 
or so tons of sludges generated in 
the scrubbers. There is also put into 
the atmosphere considerably more 
radioactivity (in the form of radium 
and radon not removed by scrub- 
bers) than ' a comparable nu- 
clear plant releases. 

Disposing of the wastes from 
coal-fired plants is not a simple 
problem. Meanwhile, by the year 
2000, we will be ripping from the 
ground about nine billion tons of 
coal each year. That coal must be 
shipped about the country, and the 
number of miners and railroad 
workers killed each year will not be 
zero. The ashes and other wastes 
must also be shipped, and disposed 
of, and that’s hardly a trivial activ- 
ity either. 



THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR 



57 




On purely humanitarian grounds, 
coal is inferior to nuclear power: the 
number of people killed per 
kiloWatt is about 100 times greater 
for coal than nuclear, when you 
examine the entire power cycle 
from mines to waste disposal; while 
the ratio with respect to members of 
the general public killed cannot be 
estimated, because no member of 
the public has ever been killed (or 
injured) by a nuclear power plant. 
As I write this, ironically, there lies 
on my desk an article about a burst- 
ing dam killing 31 people. 

But we do have coal, and we can 
survive through its use; and if we 
get on with the job we can live with 
the result, hard cheese though it 
may be for miners with black lung 
(my wife’s father died of silicosis). 
I would have thought, though, that 
those truly concerned for the en- 
vironement would prefer the nuclear 
option. 

Yet it’s very hard to find any 
kind of rational discussion of nu- 
clear energy. 

Item: a science fiction writer 
friend, a lady I respect, called me 
the other day. She wanted a drama- 
tic incident in a story. How, she 
asked, might a character cause a 
nuclear explosion — not a large one, 
just a little one — at the San Onofre 
nuclear plant? 

I told her to have her character 
carry an atom bomb into the plant. 
It’s the only way I know of. Be- 
ware of the guards, and recall that 
San Onofre is on a US Marine base. 
Where they get the atom bomb I 
don’t know. 

But — isn’t there another way? 
Another lady, a radio broadcaster 
specializing in “conservation” and 

58 



“environment” and “concern” and 
the like was present at the discus- 
sion and was certain that San 
Onofre could be made to go up like 
a bomb. Just cut the cooling water 
supply. 

She wasn’t very interested in 
hearing of the actual engineering de- 
tails of the plant — feedwater supply 
which could be used for emergency 
cooling; the emergency cooling 
system itself, etc. Nor was my sf 
writer friend, who went away dis- 
appointed and muttering about how 
she could fake it, since the public 
wouldn’t know about all the safety 
precautions. 

Item: A book published by the 
Reader’s Digest and widely touted: 
We Almost Lost Detroit. Never 
mind that we didn’t almost lose 
anything, at Detroit (where a couple 
of fuel elements of the Fermi re- 
search reactor melted, the safety 
devices worked as they should 
have, and everything shut down 
with neither disaster nor danger of 
one) or at Brown’s Ferry (where a 
twit using a candle to search for 
leaks set insulation afire and caused 
the plant to be shut down in an or- 
derly manner). 

Item: a review of We Almost Lost 
Detroit published in the New York 
Times Book Review. Written by a 
staff lawyer for the American Civil 
Liberties Union, the review states 
“They knew what the public did 
not — a mistake could trigger a nu- 
clear explosion.” Do I need to re- 
peat it? If a horde of terrorists had 
taken possession of Fermi reactor 
and used hammers and hacksaws 
they could not have triggered a 
nuclear explosion. 

Item: the last time I said a kind 

GALAXY 




word about nuclear power, there 
came in the mail from a windmill 
experimenter a letter that opened 
with obscenities. When I wrote him 
to ask what contribution that made 
to the discussion, he said that I as a 
writer ought to understand that this 
was the only way he could express 
what he felt. He enclosed some 
more obscenities, presumably to de- 
liver himself of more of his feel- 
ings; and did not seem to under- 
stand that I didn’t invent the wind 
figures, nor are his “feelings” par- 
ticularly important to the universe. I 
hope he sells lots of windmills, but 
he can’t change the energy picture 
much by doing it. 

(Incidentally, why he thought an 
old soldier would be shocked by 
anatomical obscenities is beyond 
me. Perhaps he thought my wife 
would open the mail — she some- 
times does — and that he’d impress 
her? Unlikely. Despite my misgiv- 
ings, Mrs. Poumelle teaches in a 
juvenile detention facility, and I 
suspect she could, given enough 
provocation, shock the windmill de- 
signer out of his socks.) 

Item: Jack Anderson, in a daz- 
zling display of journalistic integ- 
rity, says in a recent column: “The 
clouds originate from six mammoth, 
cylindrical cooling towers that rise 
from the banks of the Ohio river 
like idols to the gods of energy. 
Superheated [sic] vapors from the 
nuclear works below form the 
clouds which appear so white and 
innocent. But they hang over the 
Shippingport like a pall. Beneath 
them is a dying town contaminated 
by . deadly irradiated mist.” 

Would you believe he’s talking 
about Ohio river water trickled 



down through cellotex? At the bot- 
tom of the tower there is a heat ex- 
changer which connects with the 
condenser at the low-temp side of 
the turbines. No connection with the 
reactor at all, and the towers would 
be there whether Shippingport was 
fired by coal, oil, natural gas, or 
uranium; but you’d never know that 
from Anderson, who is terrified of 
fluffy white clouds composed of — 
water vapor and nothing else. 

Item: Time Magazine’s recent re- 
port on “The atom’s global gar- 
bage,” which states baldly that 
there is no technology for disposing 
of nuclear wastes. Evidently the 
editors of Time do not even read 
Scientific American, for in the June 
1977 issue of SA there is a very 
complete article on the disposal of 
reactor wastes. 

Look, can we once and for all 
dispose of the idiotic view that there 
is no place to put nuclear wastes? 
The technology is proven; they can 
be reduced to solids imbedded in 
glass. The total volume from the 
invention of the first reactor to the 
most optimistic (in my view) con- 
struction program of reactors ex- 
tending to the year 2000 is a cube 
about 100 feet on a side; in fact, if 
the world ran off nuclear reactors 
exclusively, - then in 50,000 years 
we could have enough wastes to 
cover about one square mile to a 
depth of six feet. 

There are a lot of square miles of 
desert in this world; and at the low- 
est level of technology imaginable 
those wastes .can be stored in con- 
crete structures in the Mojave, 
where they are completely recover- 
able if needed — and they just might 
be. 



THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR 



59 




In the early days of this century, 
oil companies distilled off only the 
higher- grade volatiles from crude. 
The resulting sludge was a mess, 
and it was expensive to get rid of.' 
One oil company executive ordered 
the company’s director of research 
to think of something better to do 
with crude sludge than simply stor- 
ing it. 

The result was the petrochemical 
industry: plastics, “coal-tar deriva- 
tives,” and such. Think about that 
the next time someone mentions 
“nuclear wastes.” 

And as for plutonium, it’s more 
valuable than gold; why should it be 
stored anywhere? The value of 
already-mined Uranium in this land 
is something like a trillion dollars, 
given that we go ahead with the 
breeder program — Except that we 
won’t. However, the Soviets, 
French, Germans, British, and 
Japanese are already doing so. 
Perhaps we will export Uranium? 
Instead of using it to fuel our own 
reactors, we can sell Uranium and 
buy Arab oil. Marvellous. 

Now I don’t mean to imply that 
there is no such thing as intelligent 
opposition to nuclear power; but 
there is very little of that. The 
above is a far better illustration of 
the nuclear debate. 

But, perhaps we will have to do 
without nuclear power, not on ra- 
tional grounds, but because people 
are afraid? Not if you ask the 
people. The anti-nuclear forces have 
yet to win a major referendum — but 
there are fewer and fewer nu- 
clear plants ordered, and our nu- 
clear reactor industry is liquidating 
itself, because it takes 63 — sixty- 
three — separate permits to construct 

60 



a nuclear plant, and very few com- 
panies can afford the delays and the 
legal fees required. As a means of 
subsidizing lawyers the present nu- 
clear regulation system is well 
designed — but is there not perhaps a 
cheaper method of rewarding legal 
diligence? 

It would probably be cheaper 
to give each law-school graduate 
a guaranteed salary of $50,000 
a year on the condition that he (or 
she) not practive law. 

Incidentally, the total output of 
Time magazine for eight months 
takes up more space than would all 
our nuclear wastes from 1944 to the 
year 2000. (Figure courtesy of Petr 
Beckmann.) 

Obviously, then, my “ideal” 
energy policy would remove a 
number of the constraints surround- 
ing nuclear power plants. I would 
not relax the safety regulations, nor 
would I leave plant site location to 
“experts” without discussion; but 
surely the number of permits can be 
reduced to four or five, and the 
time required to get a permit cut 
from five-plus years to one year. 

I would also do the same for 
coal; there is no reason why our 
fuels decisions should be made on 
the basis of regulatory difficulty and 
red tape, instead of economics. Util- 
ity companies, both public and pri- 
vate owned, have plenty of talent 
for deciding what kinds of plants 
they ought to build; why not let 
them employ it? But at the moment 
the Department of Energy will have 
a budget of $10 billion, and very 
little of that will go into any kind of 
meaningful research. 

★ ★ ★ 



GALAXY 




Obviously a meaningful energy 
policy must do more than streamline 
the permit system. Coal and nuclear 
power can get us to the year 2000, 
and it’s hard to see anything else 
that can; but no one genuinely loves 
either as a power source. Both have 
drawbacks, and I’m as aware of 
them as anyone. I would not care to 
leave my grandchildren the same 
problems I face. 

What, then, should we do for the 
intermediate and long terms? 

Well, first, you make certain 
there will be something that works, 
which is why I like nuclear power; 
it’s a proven technology with, in 
my judgment, fewer problems than 
coal. But having insured there will 
be power, you look for better sys- 
tems. 

I think few would argue: one ex- 
cellent power source is natural gas. 
Natural gas is a wonder fuel: it’s 
clean, it is easily and economically 
transported, the distribution system 
(pipelines) already exists; it can be 
employed in a conservation 
strategy, that is, by decentralizing 
power generation so that on-site 
plants can provide both steam and 
electricity for major industries and 
compact bedroom communities. The 
only problem with gas is that we’re 
running out it faster than of any- 
thing else (and, of course, it does 
produce CO 2 and add to the Earth’s 
heat burden; more on that later.) 

There may be a source of gas so 
large as to be nearly incredible. The 
estimated conventional reserves of 
natural gas in US fields is six billion 
cubic meters; and we’ll run out far 
too soon, unless we find and de- 
velop more. 

But that’s conventional fields. 

THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR 



There are now known to exist 
“geopressure zones;” these are 
large pockets of water, at very high 
temperature and pressure, saturated 
with gas. I quote from the 1977 
Annual Review of Energy: 

“In the northern part of the Gulf 
of Mexico (onshore and offshore), 
the only area in the world where de- 
tailed studies of geopressure zones 
have been undertaken, an area of 

375.000 km 2 is believed to contain 
a large belt of geopressure zones, 
some going down to a depth of 

16.000 meters (16 kilometers). 
The large quantity of gas in this belt 
is estimated at 1,300 trillion cubic 
meters (roughly 1 ,800 billion metric 
tons coal equivalent, comparable to 
entire US coal resources); other es- 
timates, such as the one of Dorfman 
at 160 trillion cubic meters, are 
more modest, but still impressive. 

“Throughout the world, many 
geopressure zones of the deposi- 
tional or the techtonic-occurrence 
types have been identified, but no 
estimates of their methane potential 
have been made. If appropriately 
tapped, the methane resources can 
provide, in addition to the natural 
gas dissolved, enormous amounts of 
mechanical and geothermal energies 
from the pressures in excess of 500 
kg/cm 2 and temperatures above 
200°C at depths of 6,000—7,000 
meters.” 

There are also gas hydrates, 
known as “frozen natural gas”, 
discovered byi Soviet petroleum 
geologists in the last few years, and 
also investigated by the US explora- 
tion ship Glomar Challenger. The 
Soviets estimate — are your ready for 
this? — that one million trillion re- 
peat, 10® trillion cubic meters of 



61 




methane can be found in frozen re- 
serves throughout the world’s 
oceans. 

The Annual Review adds “com- 
mercial recovery of gas from sub- 
marine hydrate is probably a very 
difficult task.” This is why I do not 
put hydrates down as a near-term 
insurance fuel source; it is risky 
technology. 

The same is true, but to a far less- 
er extent, for the geopressure 
zones. Drilling to six kilometers is 
difficult but has been done; extract- 
ing the dissolved gas from the pres- 
surized water is again tricky, but 
involves off-the-shelf technology. 
Within a few years we could have 
plenty of natural gas. 

If someone goes after it. The 
simplest way to develop this re- 
source would be to decontrol the 
price of natural gas; our fuel bills 
would be higher (but no higher than 
they’ll be after Carter’s energy 
taxes!) and plenty of developers, 
motivated by good old reliable 
greed, will break their arses trying 
to get natural gas to sell. 

Another way, one less preferable 
in my judgment but defensible, 
would be to have a government de- 
velopment program — which would 
in practice mean contracting with 
private firms to do the work, be- 
cause the expertise exists outside 
ERDA, not in it. 

What we’re doing, though, is ig- 
noring the whole situation in favor 
of taxes and a complicated 
income — redistribution scheme: and 
that, in my view, is mindless. 

Perhaps Carter doesn’t know 
about geopressure zones? But 
surely someone does. So why is this 
whole technology resource ignored 



in the President’s war on energy re- 
sources? 

★ ★ ★ 

For the long term we cannot con- 
tinue to rely on fossil fuels. There 
are perfectly legitimate conservation 
reasons — such as CO 2 buildup, and 
the overall heat balance of Earth — 
for looking to other energy sources, 
and probably the best way to have 
those taken into account is to plan 
now while someone still cares. 
Given our present war on energy, 
the day will soon dawn when no 
one will give a damn about conser- 
vation, and we will go crash pro- 
gram to strip mine coal, dig up 
pressurized gas, build nuclear 
plants, and to hell with the con- 
sequences. At the moment few, out- 
side the “snow belt” during the 
Great Freeze of ’76, have felt a real 
energy pinch; we are wealthy 
enough to give some thought for 
“the environment.” 

The poor — and that certainly in- 
cludes those rich by world standards 
but poor compared to their own 
past — generally do not care about 
long-term consequences. 

If we have a long-term goal of 
eliminating fossil fuels, there are 
only two ways to go: nuclear fu- 
sion, and some form of solar 
power. 

Fusion has received short shrift 
from Carter exactly at the time 
when the most scientific progress 
has been made. The program moved 
ahead, they have made neutrons in 
reactors, and they are ready to 
move to breakeven, the point at 
which the experiment produces 
more power than it consumes — only 



62 



GALAXY 




they need more equipment, and they 
need to keep their staffs together, 
and Carter’s budget has provision 
for neither. 

Obviously my “ideal” energy 
program restores the fusion budget 
at least to what President Ford rec- 
ommended. 

There are three ways to go with 
solar; Earth-based, space-based, and 
agricultural. The latter is a kind of 
Earth-based solar power ac- 
cumulator, of course, but uses a dif- 
ferent kind of expertise; biologists 
and agronomists rather than en- 
gineers and physicists. 

Plants typically store up about 1 
per cent of the sunlight energy that 
falls on them. A billion or so dollars 
doled out over the next few years 
could, in the judgment of people 
who have some right to an opinion, 
at least double that. I have insuffi- 
cient data on which to judge, but I 
do point out that the risk is low — 
not very much money involved, 
compared to the welfare budget, 
and if done skillfully for a few dol- 
lars more an agricultural research 
program could be a part of a jobs 
program. And the payoff is very 
high. I quote Jonathan Swift: 
“Whoever could make two ears of 
corn, or two blades of grass, to 
grow where only one grew before, 
would deserve better of mankind 
than the whole race of politicians.” 

Some forms of Earth-based solar 
research get a good bit of money; 
but the technological risks are quite 
high, except in the small backyard 
“appropriate technology” applica- 
tions. I have nothing against 
those — I shall probably install a 
form of solar heating system for my 
hot-water and office heaters— but 




they will not save us, and they are 
rather expensive. As a form of con- 
servation they are excellent, but 
conservation is not the answer. 

Still, Earth-based solar is one 
program with a long-term payoff 
that is treated about as it deserves to 
be. We shall see whether, when the 
payoff finally comes near, the 
“ecologists” and “concerned scien- 
tists” will not try to halt actual in- 
stallations: after all, the solar con- 
stant is 1 kiloWatt per square meter, 
and to get 1,000 megaWatts one 
must cover at least a million square 
meters; probably a lot more, and 
this will go into the “fragile ecol- 
ogy” of the desert. 

If the desert is too valuable to 
take up a few thousand square met- 
ers as nuclear waste storage, I won- 
der why it can be covered with little 
blue cells; but perhaps. 



THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF WAR 



63 








Finally, there is space-based solar 
power, a concept whose time seems 
to have come — except that it re- 
ceives no mention in the President’s 
declaration of the moral equivalent 
of war, nor has NASA got what 
anyone would consider adequate 
funding. I have discussed SPS sys- 
tems in other columns. For my 
energy program I would give NASA 
an additional $2 billion for booster 
development, thus insuring access 
to space; and fund at a few tens of 
millions feasibility studies of power 
satellite systems. Incidentally, the 
United States gives the World Bank 
$2 billion a year, of which $225 
million goes directly for the salaries 
of McNamara and 374 other top 
executives; and if that $225 million 
is well spent, surely some develop- 
ment of solar power satellites 
would be even more worthwhile? 

I haven’t even mentioned other 
schemes, such as the ocean ther- 
mal system I’ve described before. I 
haven’t budgeted for garbage and 
trash (their potential is not great, 
about 5 per cent at best, but then no 
one seriously believes windmills 
can contribute much more than 5 per 
cent of the energy requirement, and 
windmills are getting lot of money). 
I haven’t got far out and talked of 
mining the Moon, or building big 
space colonies. 

I haven’t spoken of airboats — you 
know, big plastic structures with 
sides about 500 meters high; you 
pump out the air and they will liter- 
ally float on air; get them up in the 
jet stream and mount windmills on 
them, and send power down the 
tether cable. That is far out; al- 
though not impossible, and surely 
better than poverty or war. 

64 



But, curiously, nothing of this 
emerges from the President’s battle 
plan. Despite the rhetoric about the 
obscene profits of the big oil com- 
panies, the President’s moral equi- 
valent of war has the effect of giv- 
ing the big internationals a 
monopoly on our most vital need. 

So on whom has Mr. Carter de- 
clared war? 



★ ★ ★ 

For those who’d like to get in on 
a discussion of these and other mat- 
ters, it isn’t too late to send a dollar 
to the Los Angeles in ’81 Commit- 
tee, Los Angeles, CA 90005. For 
that you get membership in the LA 
in ’81 Booster Club. The committee 
seeks to put on the World Science 
Fiction Convention in Los Angeles, 
and has promised as part of the 
program an uninterrupted panel/bull 
session on science fact, with par- 
ticipation by the audience, myself, 
and several invited scientists of 
far-out persuasions. The intent is to 
continue the discussion to such hour 
as all are satisfied or horizontal 
from exhaustion. 

Maybe there, or somewhere, I’ll 
hear some sensible reasons why my 
program wouldn’t be better than 
President Carter’s moral equivalent 
of war; because right now, Carter’s 
program makes no sense to me at 
all. It cannot, so far as I can see, 
accomplish anything in the energy 
field; surely its impacts are greatest 
in incomes policies. And surely the 
President is not cynically presenting 
a tax policy disguised as a war on 
energy shortfall? I’d hate to believe 
that. ★

These “kernels” car- 
ried in them seeds 
of death! 



Everyone on the Control Stage 
found cause to be working aft when 
Yifter came on board. There was 
maximum security, of course, so no 
one could get really close without a 
good reason. Even so, we all took 
the best look we could manage— 
after all, you don’t often have a 
chance to see a man who has killed 
a billion people. 

Bryson, from the Planetary Coor- 
dinators’ office, was at Yifter’s el- 
bow. The two men were not shack- 
led together or anything melodrama- 
tic like that. Past a certain level of 
notoriety, criminals are treated with 
some deference, and even respect. 
Bryson and Yifter were talking to- 
gether in a friendly way, although 
they were in the middle of a group 
of top-rank security men, all heavily 
armed and watchful. They were tak- 
ing safety to extremes. 

When I stepped forward to greet 
Bryson and his prisoner, two guards 
carefully frisked me before I could 
get within hand-kill range, and they 
stood close behind me when the in- 
troductions were made. I haven’t 
been on Earth for a long time, and 
they must have known that I have 
no close relatives there; but they 
were taking no chances. Yifter was 
a prime target for personal revenge. 
A billion slain people leave a lot of 
friends and relatives behind. 



From a distance of one meter Yif- 
ter’s appearance did not match his 
reputation. He was of medium 
height, slightly built, with bushy, 
prematurely white hair and mild, 
sad eyes. He smiled at me in a 
tired, tolerant way as Bryson intro- 
duced us. 

“I am sorry, Captain Roker,” he 
said. “Your ship will be filled with 
strangers on this trip. I’ll do my 
best to keep out of your way and let 
you do your job.” 

I hoped he could live up to his 
words. Since I took over the runs to 
Titan, I’ve carried most things in 
the connected set of cargo spheres 
that make up the Assembly. Apart 
from the kernels, and we carry a 
few of those on the outbound leg of 
every trip, we’ve had livestock, 
mega-crystals, the gravity simulator 
and the circus. That’s right, the cir- 
cus. It must have had a terrible 
agent, that’s all I can say. I took it 
both ways, to Titan and back to 
L-5. 

Even with all that, Yifter was 
still a novelty item. After he had 
been caught and the rest of the 
Lucies had gone underground, no- 
body had known quite what to do 
with him. He was Earth’s hottest 
property, the natural target for a bil- 
lion guns and knives. Until they de- 
cided how and when he would 
come to trial, they wanted him a 
long way from Earth. It was my job 
to deliver him to the Titan penal 
colony, and .return him when they 
got themselves sorted out on Earth. 

“I’ll arrange for you and your 
guards to trayel in a separate part of 
the Assembly,” I said. “I assume 
that you will prefer privacy.” 

Yifter nodded agreeably, but Bry- 

67 



KILLING VECTOR 




son wasn’t having any. 

“Captain Roker,” he said, “let 
me remind you that Mr. Yifter has 
not been found guilty on any 
charge. On this journey, and until 
his trial, he will be treated with 
proper courtesy. I expect you to 
house both of us here in the Control 
Stage, and I expect that you will 
invite us to take our meals here 
with you.” 

In principle I could have told him 
to go and take a walk outside. As 
captain, I determined who would 
travel in the Control Stage and who 
would eat with me — and innocent 
people were not usually sent to the 
Titan penal colony, even before 
trial. On the other hand, Bryson 
was from the Planetary Cooordi- 
nator’s office, and even off- 
Earth that status carried weight. 

I suppressed my first reaction and 
said quietly, “What about the 
guards?” 

"They can travel in the Second 
Section, right behind the Control 
Stage,” replied Bryson. 

I shrugged. If he wanted to make 
nonsense of Earth’s security efforts, 
that was his choice. Nothing had 
ever happened on any of my two- 
month runs from Earth to Titan, and 
Bryson was probably quite right; 
nothing would happen this time. On 
the other hand, it seemed like a 
damned silly charade to ship 
twenty-five guards to keep an eye 
on Yifter and then house them in a 
separate part of the Assembly. 

Yifter, with an uncanny empathy, 
had read through my shrug. “Don’t 
worry about security, Captain 
Roker,” he said. He smiled again, 
that tired, soothing smile that began 
deep in his sad, brown eyes. “You 



have my assurance, 1 will be a 
model prisoner.” 

He and Bryson walked on past 
me, into the main quarters. Was 
that really Yifter, the bogey-man, 
the notorious head of the Hal- 
lucinogenic Freedom League? It 
seemed hard to believe. Three 
months earlier, the Lucies — under 
Yifter’s messianic direction — had 
planted hallucinogenic drugs in the 
water-supply lines of most of 
Earth’s major cities. An eighth of 
the world’s population had died in 
the resulting chaos. Starvation, 
epidemic, exposure and mindless 
combat had re-visited the Earth and 
exacted their age-old tribute. The 
monster who had conceived, plan- 
ned and directed that horror was 
difficult to match with Yifter, the 
seemingly mild and placid man. 

My thoughts were quickly 
diverted to more immediate practi- 
cal matters. We had the final mass- 
es of all the cargo and it was time 
for the final balancing of the whole 
Assembly. One might assume that 
means just balancing the kernels 
correctly, since they out-mass ev- 
erything else by a factor of a mil- 
lion. But each Section containing a 
kernel has an independent drive 
unit, powered by the kernel itself. 
We leave those on Titan and travel 
back light; but on the trip out, the 
dynamic balancing is quite tricky. 

I reviewed the final configura- 
tion, then looked around for McAn- 
drew. I wanted him to look over the 
balance calculations. It’s my re- 
sponsibility, but he’s the kernel ex- 
pert. I realized that he hadn’t been 
present when Yifter came aboard. 
Presumably he was over on one of 
the other Sections, crooning over 



68 



GALAXY 




his beloved power sources. 

I found him in Section Seven. 
The Assembly is made up of a vari- 
able number of Sections, and there 
would be twelve on this trip, plus 
the Control Stage. Until we acceler- 
ate away from the Libration Colony 
station, all the Sections are physi- 
cally connected — with actual 

cables — to each other and to the 
Control Stage. In flight, the cou- 
pling is done electromagnetically, and 
the drives for the powered Sections 
are all controlled by a computer on 
the Control Stage. 

The Assembly looks like a small 
bunch of grapes, but the stalks are 
non-functional — there are no cables 
in the System that could take the 
strain, even at lowest acceleration. 
Moving among the spherical Sec- 
tions when we’re in flight is no 
easy task. It means we have to cut 
the drives and turn off the coupling 
between the Sections. That’s why I 
thought the idea of having Yifter’s 
guards in a different Section was so 
dumb; from there, they couldn’t 
even reach the Control Stage when 
the drives were on. 

I wanted McAndrew to check the 
configuration that we would hold in 
flight, to see if he agreed that the 
stresses were decently balanced 
among the different Sections. We 
never run near the limit on any of 
them but there’s a certain pride of 
workmanship in getting them all 
approximately equal, and the 
stresses as low as possible. 

He was standing on the ten-meter 
shield that surrounds the Section 
Seven kernel, peering through a 
long boresight pointed in toward the 
center. He was aware of my pres- 
ence but did not move or speak 

KILLING VECTOR 



until the observation was complete. 
Finally he nodded in satisfaction, 
closed the boresight cap and turned 
to me. 

“Just checking the optical sca- 
lars,” he said. “Spun up nicely, 
this one. So, what can I do for you, 
Captain?” 

I led him outside the second 
shield before I handed him the trim 
calculations. I know a kernel shield 
has never failed, but I’m still not 
comfortable when I get too close to 
one. I once asked McAndrew how 
he felt about working within ten 
meters of Hell, where you could ac- 
tually feel the gravity gradient and 
the inertial dragging. He had looked 
at me with his little introspective 
smile and made a sort of throat- 
clearing noise— the only trace of his 
ancestry that I could ever find in 
him. 

“Och,” he said, “the shields are 
triply protected. They won’t fail.” 

That would have reassured me, 
but then he had rubbed his high, 
balding forehead and added, “And 
if they do, it won’t make any dif- 
ference if you are ten meters away 
or five hundred. That kernel would 
radiate at about two gigawatts, most 
of it high-energy gammas.” 

The trouble was, he always had 
the facts right. When I first met 
McAndrew, seven years earlier, we 
were taking the first shipment of 
kernels out to Titan. He had 
showed up with them, and I had 
assumed that he was just an- 
other engineer — a good one, maybe, 
but I expected that. Five minutes of 
conversation- with him told me that 
he had probably forgotten more a- 
bout Kerr-Newman black holes — 
kernels — than I was ever likely to 

69 




learn. I have degrees in Electrical 
Engineering and Gravitational En- 
gineering; in my job I have to, but 
I’m really no gravity specialist. I 
felt like an idiot after our first talk. 
I made a few inquiries and found 
that McAndrew was a full professor 
at the Penrose Institute, and prob- 
ably the System’s leading expert on 
space-time structure. 

When we got to know each other 
better, I asked him why he would 
give up his job for four months of 
the year to ride herd on a bunch of 
kernels being shipped around the 
Solar System. It was a milk-run, 
with lots of time and very little to 
do. Most people would be bored 
silly. 

“I need it,” he said simply. “It’s 
very nice to work with colleagues 
but in my line of business the real 
stuff is mostly worked out alone. 
And I can do experiments here that 
wouldn’t be allowed back home.” 

After that I accepted his way of 
working and took vicarious pride in 
the stream of papers that appeared 
from McAndrew at the end of each 
Titan run. He was no trouble on the 
trips. He spent most of his time in 
the Sections carrying the kernels, 
only appearing in the Control Stage 
for his meals — and frequently miss- 
ing them. He was a tinkerer as 
well as a theorist. Isaac Newton 
was his idol. His work had paid off 
in higher shielding efficiencies, bet- 
ter energy-extraction methods and 
more sensitive manipulation of the 
charged kernels. Each trip we had 
something new. 

I left the trim calculations with 
him and he promised to look them 
over and give me his comments in 
an hour or two. I had to move 



along and check the rest of the 
cargo. 

“By the way,” I said, elabo- 
rately casual as I turned to go, 
“we’ll be having company for din- 
ner on this trip. Bryson insists that 
Yiften should eat with us.” 

He stood quiet for a moment, 
head slightly bowed. Then he nod- 
ded and ran his hand over his 
sandy, receding hairline. 

“That sounds like Bryson,” he 
said. “Well, I doubt if Yifter will 
eat any of us for breakfast. I’m not 
sure he’ll be any worse than the rest 
of you. I’ll be there.” 

I breathed a small sigh of relief 
and left him. McAndrew, as I knew 
from experience, was the Compleat 
Pacifist. I had wanted to be sure 
that he could stand the idea of hav- 
ing meals with Yifter. 

Four hours later all our checks 
were complete. I switched on the 
fields. The dull gray .exterior of 
each Section turned to silver, shat- 
tering the sunlight and turning the 
Assembly to a cluster of brilliants. 
The cables linking the Sections 
were still in position but now they 
were hanging loose. All stresses had 
been picked up by the balancing 
fields. 

In the Control Stage I gradually 
turned on the propulsion units of 
each powered Section. Plasma was 
fed through the ergosphere of each 
kernel, picked up energy and 
streamed aft. The relative positions 
of the Sections, Mossbauer- 
controlled to within fractions of a 
micrometer, held steady. Slowly we 
accelerated away from L-5 and 
began the long spiral of a 
continuous-impulse orbit to Titan. 

My work was just about finished 



70 



GALAXY 




until crossover time. The computers 
monitored the drive feeds, the ac- 
celerations and all the balance of 
the Sections. On this trip we had 
three units without operating drive 
units: Section Two, where Yifter’s 
guards were housed, just behind the 
Control Stage; Section Seven, 
where McAndrew had taken the 
kernel out of commission for his 
usual endless and mysterious exper- 
iments; and, of course, the Control 
Stage itself. 

I had made the mistake of asking 
McAndrew what experiments he 
was planning for this trip. He had 
looked at me with his innocent blue 
eyes and scribbled an answer full of 
twistor diagrams and spinor 
notations — knowing damn well that 
I wouldn’t be able to follow it. He 
didn’t like to talk about his work 
“half-cooked,” as he put it. 

★ ★ ★ 

1 had been more worried than I 
wanted to admit about dinner on 
that first ship-evening. I knew we 
would all be itching to ask Yifter 
about the Lucies but there was no 
easy way to introduce the subject 
into the conversation. How could 
we do it? “By the way, I hear that 
you killed a billion people a few 
months ago. I wonder if you would 
like to say a few words on the sub- 
ject. It would liven up the table-talk 
at dinner.” I could foresee that our 
conversation might be a little 
strained. 

As it turned out, my worries were 
unnecessary. The first impression 
that I’d had of Yifter, that of a mild 
and amiable man, strengthened on 
longer exposure. It was Bryson, 

KILLING VECTOR 



during dinner, who caused the first 
tricky moment. 

“Most of Earth’s problems are 
caused by the United Space Federa- 
tion’s influence,” he said as the 
robo-server, always on best form at 
the beginning of the trip, rolled in 
the courses. “If it weren’t for the 
U.S.F. , there wouldn’t be as much 
discontent and rioting on Earth. It’s 
all relative — living space and living 
standards — and the U.S.F. sets a 
bad example. We can’t compete.” 

According to Bryson, three mil- 
lion people were causing all the 
problems for seven billion — eight, 
before Yifter’s handiwork. It was 
sheer nonsense and as a U.S.F. citi- 
zen, I should have been the one to 
bridle; but it was McAndrew who 
made a growling noise of disap- 
proval, down in his throat; and it 
was Yifter, of all people, who 
sensed the atmosphere the quickest 
and deftly steered the conversation 
to another subject. 

“I think Earth’s worst problems 
are caused by the power shortage,” 
he said. “That affects everything 
else. Why doesn’t Earth use the 
kernels for power, the way the 
U.S.F. does?”' 

“Too afraid of an accident,” re- 
plied McAndrew. His irritation 
evaporated immediately at the men- 
tion of his specialty. “If the shields 
ever failed, you would have a 
Kerr-Newman black hole sitting 
there, pumping out a thousand 
megawatts, mostly as high-energy 
radiation and fast particles. Worse 
than that, it would pull in free 
charge and become electrically neu- 
tral. As soon as that happened, there 
would be no way to hold it elec- 
tromagnetically. It would sink down 

71 




and orbit inside the Earth. We 
couldn’t afford to have that hap- 
pen.” 

“But couldn’t we use smaller 
kernels on Earth?” asked Yifter. 
“They would be less dangerous.” 
McAndrew shook his head. “It 
doesn’t work that way. The smaller 
the black hole, the higher the effec- 
tive temperature and the faster it 
radiates. You’d be better off with a 
much more massive black hole. But 
then you have the problem of sup- 
porting it against Earth’s gravity. 
Even with the best electromagnetic 
control, anything that massive 
would sink down into the Earth.” 

“I suppose it wouldn’t help to 
use a non-rotating, uncharged hole, 
either,” said Yifter. “That might be 
easier to work with.” 

“A Schwarzschild hole?” 
McAndrew looked at him in dis- 

72 



gust. “Now, Mr. Yifter, you know 
better than that.” He grew 
eloquent. “A Schwarzschild hole 
gives you no control at all. You 
can’t get ahold of it electromagneti- 
cally. It just sits there spewing out 
energy all over the spectrum, and 
there’s nothing you can do to 
change it — unless you want to 
charge it and spin it up and make it 
into a kernel. With the kernels now, 
you have control.” 

I tried to interrupt but McAndrew 
was just getting warmed up. “A 
Schwarzschild hole is like a naked 
flame,” he went on. “A caveman’s 
device. A kernel is refined, it’s con- 
trollable. You can spin it up and 
store energy or you can use the er- 
gosphere to pull energy out and spin 
it down. You can use the charge on 
it to move it about as you want. It s 
a real working instrument, not a bit 

GALAXY 



of crudity from the Dark Ages.” 

I shook my head and sighed in 
simulated despair. “Me Andrew, 

you have an unconsummated love 
affair with those blasted kernels.” I 
turned to Yifter and Bryson, who 
had watched Me Andrew’s outburst 
with some surprise. “He spends all 
his waking hours spinning those 
things up and down. All during the 
last trip he was working the kernels 
in gravitational focusing experi- 
ments. You know, using the fact 
that a gravity field bends light rays. 
He insists that one day we won’t 
use lenses for optics — we’ll focus 
light using arrays of kernels.” 

I made the old joke. “We hardly 
saw him on that trip. We were con- 
vinced that one day he’d get care- 
less with the shields, fall into one 
of the kernels and really make a 
spectacle of himself. ’ ’ 

They didn’t get it. Yifter and 
Bryson looked at me blankly while 
McAndrew, who had heard it all 
ten times before, chuckled. We have 
the same sense of humor — a bad 
joke is always funny, even if it’s 
the hundredth time you’ve heard it 
told. 

It’s a strange thing, but after the 
first half-hour I had stopped think- 
ing of Yifter as our prisoner. I 
could understand now why Bryson 
had objected to the idea of sur- 
rounding Yifter with armed guards. 
I would have objected myself. He 
seemed the most civilized man in 
the group, with a warm personality 
and a very dry and subtle sense of 
humor. 

When Bryson left the table, 
pleading a long day and a lack of 
familiarity with a space environ- 
ment, Yifter, McAndrew and I 



stayed on, chatting about the previ- 
ous trips I had made to Titan. I 
mentioned the time I had taken the 
circus. 

“Do you know, I’d never seen 
most of those animals before,” I 
said. “They were all on the list of 
endangered species. I don’t think 
you could find them on Earth any 
more, expect in a circus or a zoo.” 

There was a moment of silence; 
then Yifter spoke. His eyes were 
mild and smiling, and his voice 
sounded dreamy and distant. 

“Endangered species,” he said. 
“That’s the heart of it. Earth has no 
room for failures. The weaker 
species, like weaker specimens of a 
species, must be eliminated. Only 
the strong — the mentally strong- 
may survive. The weak must be 
culled, for our own sake; whether 
that means one tenth, one half, or 
nine tenths of the total.” 

There was a chilling pause. I 
looked at Yifter, whose expression 
had not changed, then at McAn- 
drew, whose face reflected the hor- 
ror that I was feeling. Yet behind 
all that, I could feel the unique 
power of the man. My mind was re- 
jecting him but I still had a sense of 
well-being, of warmth in the pit of 
my stomach, as he was speaking. 

“We have made a beginning,” 
went on Yifter quietly. “Just a be- 
ginning. Last time we were less 
successful than I had hoped. We 
had a breakdown in the distribution 
system of the drugs. I managed to 
eliminate the responsible individuals 
but it was too late to correct the 
problem. Next time, God willing, it 
will be different.” 

He rose to his feet, white hair 
shining like silver, face beatific.

“Good night, Captain. Good night, 
Professor Me Andrew. Sleep well.” 

After he had left, McAndrew and 
I sat and looked at each other for a 
long time. Finally he broke the 
spell. 

“Now we know. Captain. We 
should have guessed it from the be- 
ginning. Mad as a hatter. The 
man’s a raving lunatic. Completely 
psychotic.” 

That said most of it. McAndrew 
had used up all the good phrases. I 
nodded. 

“But did you feel the strength in 
him?” went on McAndrew. “Like 
a big magnet.” 

I was glad that the penal colony 
was so far from Earth, and the av- 
enues of communication so well- 
guarded. “Next time ... it will be 
different.” 

Our two-month trip suddenly 
seemed to have doubled in length. 

★ ★ ★ 

After that single chilling moment, 
there were no more shocks for some 
time. Our regular meal-time conver- 
sations continued, and on several 
occasions McAndrew voiced views 
on pacifism and the protection of 
human life. Each time I waited for 
Yifter’s reply, expecting the worst. 
He never actually agreed with 
Mac — but neither did he come out 
with any statement that resembled 
his comments of the first ship- 
evening. 

We soon settled into the ship- 
board routine. McAndrew spent less 
and less time in the Control Stage 
and more in Section Seven. On this 
trip he had brought a new set of 
equipment for his experiments, and 



I was very curious to know what he 
was up to. He wouldn’t tell. I had 
only one clue. Section Seven was 
drawing enormous energy from the 
other kernels in the rest of the As- 
sembly. That energy could be going 
to only one place — into the kernel 
in Section Seven. I suspected that 
McAndrew must be spinning it up: 
making it closer to an “extreme” 
kernel, a Kerr-Newman black hole 
where the rotation energy matches 
the mass energy. I knew that 
couldn’t be the whole story. McAn- 
drew had spun up the kernels be- 
fore, and he had told me that there 
was no direct way of getting a re- 
ally extreme kernel; that would take 
an infinite amount of energy. This 
time he was doing something differ- 
ent. He insisted that Section Seven 
be off-limits to everybody. 

I could not get him to talk about 
it. There would be a couple of sec- 
onds of silence from him, then he 
would stand there, cracking his fin- 
ger joints as though he were snap- 
ping out a coded message to me. 
He could be a real sphinx when he 
chose. 

Two weeks from Earth, we were 
drawing clear of the main Asteroid 
Belt. I had just about concluded that 
my worries for the trip were over 
when the radar reported another 
ship, closing slowly with us from 
astern, its spectral signature iden- 
tified it as the Lesotho, a cruise 
liner that usually ran trajectories in 
the Inner System. It was broadcast- 
ing a Mayday and flying free under 
zero drive power. 

I thought about it for a moment, 
then posted Emergency Stations 
throughout the Assembly. The com- 
puted trajectory showed that we 



74 



GALAXY 




would match velocities at a separa- 
tion of three kilometers. That was 
incredibly close, far too close to be 
accidental. After closest approach, 
we would pull away again — we 
were still under power, accelerating 
outward, and would leave the 
Lesotho behind. 

I was watching the displays, try- 
ing to decide whether or not to take 
the next step — shutting off the 
drives — when Bryson appeared, 

with Yifter just behind him. 

“Captain Roker,’’ he said in his 
usual imperious manner, “that’s an 
Earth ship there, giving you a dis- 
tress signal. Why aren’t you doing 
anything about it?” 

“If we wait just a few minutes,” 
I said, “we’ll be within spitting dis- 
tance of her. I see no point in rush- 
ing in, not until we’ve had a good 
look at her. I can’t think what an 
Inner System ship would be doing, 
free-falling out here beyond the 
Belt.” 

That didn’t cool him. “Can’t 
your recognize an emergency when 
you see one?” he asked. “If you 
won’t do something productive with 
your people. I’ll do something with 
mine.” 

I wondered what he wanted me to 
do, but he walked away without 
saying anything more and went 
down the stairs that led to the rear 
communications area of the Control 
Stage. I turned back to the displays. 
The Lesotho was closing on us 
steadily, and now I could see that 
her locks were open. I cut our 
propulsion to zero and switched off 
all the drives. The other ship was 
tumbling slowly, drive lifeless and 
aft nacelles crumpled. Even from 
this distance I could see that she 



would need extensive repairs before 
she could function again. 

I was beginning to think that I 
had been over-cautious when two 
things happened. Yifter’s guards, 
who had been housed behind the 
Control Stage in Section Two, 
began to float into view on the view- 
ing screen that pointed toward 
the Lesotho. They were all in space 
armor and heavily weaponed. At the 
same time two suited figures ap- 
peared in the open forward lock of 
the other vessel. I cut in the suit 
frequencies on our main board. 

“. shield failure,” said the re- 
ceiver. “Twenty-seven survivors, 
and bad injuries. We must have 
pain-killers, medical help, water, 
food, oxygen and power-packs.” 

With that, one group of our 
guards outside began to move to- 
ward the two suited figures in the 
Lesotho ' s lock, while the remainder 
stayed close to the Assembly, look- 
ing across at the other ship. Sub- 
consciously I noted the number of 
our guards in each party, then gave 
them my full attention and did a 
rapid re-count. Twenty-five. All our 
guards. I swore and cut in the 
transmitter. 

“Sergeant, get half of those men 
back inside the Assembly shields. 
This is Captain Roker. I’m over- 
riding any other orders you may 
have received. Get the nearer 
party — ” 

I was interrupted. The display 
screen flashed blue-white, then over- 
loaded. The whole Control Stage 
rang like a great bell as something 
slapped hafd on the outer shield. I 
knew what it was: a huge pulse of 
hard radiation and highly energetic 
particles, smashing into us in a frac- 



KILLING VECTOR

tion of a microsecond. 

Yifter had been floating within a 
couple of meters of me, watching 
the screens. He put his hand to the 
wall to orient himself as the Control 
Stage vibrated violently. “What 
was that?” 

“Thermonuclear explosion,” 1 
said shortly. “Hundred megaton 
plus. On the Lesotho . ” 

All the screens on that side were 
dead. I activated the standby sys- 
tem. The Lesotho had vanished. 
The guards had vanished with it, 
vaporized instantly. All the cables 
linking the parts of the Assembly, 
all the scanners and sensors that 
were not protected behind the 
shields, were gone. The Sections 
themselves were intact but their 
coupling fields would have to be 
completely re-calibrated. We would 
not be arriving at Titan on schedule. 

I looked again at Yifter. His face 
was now calm and thoughtful. He 
seemed to be waiting, listening ex- 
pectantly. For what? If the Lesotho 
had been a suicide mission, manned 
by volunteers who sought revenge 
on Yifter, it hadn’t had a chance. 
They couldn’t destroy the Assem- 
bly, or get at Yifter. If revenge 
were not the purpose, what was ? 

I ran through in my mind the 
events of the past hour. With the 
drives switched off in the Assem- 
bly, we had an unprotected blind 
spot dead astern. We had been put- 
ting all our attention on the 
Lesotho. Now, with all the guards 
dead, the Control Stage was unde- 
fended. 

It was quicker to go aft and take 
a look than to call Bryson and 
McAndrew and ask them what they 
could see from the rear viewing 



screens of the Control Stage. Leav- 
ing Yifter, I dived head-first down 
the stairway — a risky maneuver if 
there were any chance that the 
drive might come back on; but I was 
sure it could not. 

It took me about thirty seconds to 
travel the length of the Control 
Stage. By the time that I was half- 
way there, I knew I had been think- 
ing much too slowly. I heard the 
clang of a lock, a shout, and the 
sputtering crackle of a hand laser 
against solid metal. When I got to 
the rear compartment, it was all 
finished. 

Bryson, pale and open-mouthed, 
was floating against one wall. He 
seemed unhurt. McAndrew had 
fared less well. He was ten meters 
further along, curled into a fetal 
ball. Floating near him I saw a fam- 
ily of four stubby pink worms with 
red-brown heads, still unclenching 
with muscle spasm. I could also see 
the deep bum on his side and chest, 
and his right hand, from which a 
laser had neatly clipped the fingers 
and cauterized the wound instantly 
as it did so. At the far end of the 
room, braced against the wall, were 
five suited figures, all well-armed. 

Heroics would serve no purpose. 
I spread my arms wide to show that 
I was not carrying a weapon, and 
one of the newcomers pushed off 
from the wall and floated past me, 
heading toward the front of the 
Control Stage. I moved over to 
McAndrew and inspected his 
wounds. They looked bad, but not 
fatal. Fortunately laser wounds are 
usually very clean. I could see that 
we would have problems with his 
lung unless we treated him quickly. 
A lobe had been penetrated and his 



76 



GALAXY 




breathing was slowly breaking the 
seal of crisped tissue the laser had 
made. Blood was beginning to well 
through and stain his clothing. 

McAndrew’s forehead was bead- 
ed with sweat. As the shock of 
his wounds wore off, the pain was 
beginning. I pointed to the medical 
belt of one of the invaders, who 
nodded and tossed an ampoule 
across to me. 1 injected McAndrew 
intravenously at the big vein inside 
his right elbow. 

The figure that had pushed past 
me was returning, followed by Yif- 
ter. The face-plate of the suit was 
now open, revealing a dark-haired 
woman in her early thirties. She' 
looked casually at the scene, nod- 
ded at last and turned back to Yif- 
ter. 

"Everything is under control 
here,” she said, "but we’ll have to 
take a Section from the Assembly. 
The ship we were following in 
caught some of the blast from the 
Lesotho, and it’s no good for pow- 
ered flight now.” 

Yifter shook his head reprov- 
ingly. "Impatient as usual, Akhtar. 
I’ll bet you were just too eager to 
get here. You must learn patience if 
you are to be of maximum value to 
us, my dear. Where did you leave 
the main group?” 

"A few hours’ drive inward from 
here. We have waited for your res- 
cue before making any plans for the 
next phase.” 

Yifter, calm as ever, nodded ap- 
provingly. “The right decision. We 
can take a Section without diffi- 
culty. Most of them contain their 
own drives but some are less effec- 
tive than others.” 

He turned to me, smiling gently. 

KILLING VECTOR 



“Captain Roker, which Section is 
the best equipped to carry us away 
from the Assembly? As you see, it 
is time for us to leave you and re- 
join our colleagues.” 

His calm was worse than any 
number of threats. 1 floated next to 
McAndrew, trying to think of some 
way that we could delay or impede 
the Lucies’ escape. It might take 
days for a rescue party to reach us. 
In that time Yifter and his followers 
could be anywhere. 

I hesitated. Yifter waited. “Come 
now,” he said at last. “I’m sure 
you are as eager as I am to avoid 
any further annoyance — ” He 

moved his hand, just a little, to in- 
dicate McAndrew and Bryson, “ — 
for your friends.” 

I shrugged. All the Sections con- 
tained emergency life-support sys- 
tems, more than enough for a trip 
of a few hours. Section Two, where 
the guards had been housed, lacked 
a full, independent drive unit, but it 
was still capable of propulsion. I 
thought it might slow their escape 
enough for us to somehow track it. 

“Section Two should be 
adequate,” I. said. “It housed your 
guards in comfort. Those poor dev- 
ils certainly have no need for it 
now.” 

I paused. Beside me, McAndrew 
was painfully straightening from his 
contorted position. The drugs were 
beginning to work. He coughed, 
and red globules floated away 
across the room. That lung needed 
attention. 

“No,” he said faintly. “Not 
Two, Yifter. Seven. Section Sev- 
en.” 

He paused and coughed again, 
while I looked at him in surprise. 

77 




“Seven,” he said at last. He 
looked at me. “No killing, Captain. 
No . killing vector.” 

The woman was listening closely. 
She regarded both of us suspi- 
ciously. “What was all that about?” 
My mouth was gaping open, as 
wide as Bryson’s. I had caught an 
idea of what McAndrew was trying 
to tell me but I didn’t want to say 
it. Fortunately I was helped out by 
Yifter himself. 

“No killing,” he said. “My 
dear, you have to understand that 
Professor McAndrew is a devoted 
pacifist — and carrying his principles 
through admirably. He doesn’t want 
to see any further killing. I think I 
can agree with that, for the pres- 
ent.” 

He looked at me and shook his 
head. “I won’t inquire what dan- 
gers and drawbacks Section Two 
might contain. Captain . though 
I do seem to recall that it lacks a 
decent drive unit. I think we’ll fol- 
low the Professor’s advice and take 
Section Seven. Akhtar is a very 
competent engineer and I’m sure 
she’ll have no trouble coupling the 
drive to the kernel.” 

He looked at us with a strange 
expression. If if didn’t sound so 
peculiar. I’d describe it as wistful. 
“I shall miss our conversations,” 
he said, “but I must say goodbye 
now. I hope that Professor McAn- 
drew will recover. He is one of the 
strong — unless he allows himself to 
be killed by his unfortunate pacifist 
fancies. We may not meet again, 
but I am sure that you will be hear- 
ing about us in the next few 
months.” 

They left. McAndrew, Bryson 
and I watched the screens in silence 

78

as the Lucies made their way over 
to Section Seven and entered it. 
Once they were inside, I went over 
to McAndrew and took him by the 
left arm. 

“Come on,” I said. “We have to 
get a patch on that lung.” 

He shook his head weakly. “Not 
yet. It can wait a few minutes. 
After that it might not be neces- 
sary.” 

His forehead was beading with 
sweat again, and this time it was 
not from pain. I felt my own ten- 
sion mounting steadily. We stayed 
by the display screen and as the 
seconds ticked away, my forehead 
began also to film with perspiration. 
We did not speak. I had one ques- 
tion, but I was terribly afraid of the 
answer I might get. I think that 
Bryson spoke to both of us several 
times. I have no idea of what he 
said. 

Finally a pale nimbus grew at the 
rear of the Section Seven drive unit. 

“Now,” said McAndrew, “he’s 
going to tap the kernel.” 

I stopped breathing. There was a 

GALAXY 




pause of a few seconds, stretching 
to infinity; then the image on the 
screen rippled slightly. Suddenly we 
could see stars shining through that 
area. Section Seven was gone, van- 
ished, leaving no sign that it had 
ever existed. 

McAndrew took in a long, pained 
breath, wincing as his injured lung 
expanded. Somehow he managed a 
little smile. 

“Well now,” he said. “That an- 
swers a theoretical question that 
I’ve had on my mind for some 
time.” 

I could breathe again too. “I 
didn’t know what was going to hap- 
pen there,” I said. “1 was afraid all 
the energy might come out of that 
kernel in one go.” 

McAndrew nodded. “To be hon- 
est, the same thought was in my 
head. At this range the shields 
would have been useless. We would 
have gone like last year’s lovers.” 
Bryson had been watching the 
whole thing in confusion. We had 
been ignoring him completely. At 
last, pale and irritable, he spoke to 
us again. 

“What are you two talking 
about? And what has happened to 
the Section with Yifter in it? I was 
watching on the screen; then it just 
seemed to disappear.” 

“McAndrew tried to tell us earli- 
er,” I said. “But he didn’t want the 
Lucies to know what he was getting 
at. He had been fiddling with the 
kernel in that Section. You heard 
what he said — no killing vector. I 
don’t know what he did but he 
fixed it so that the kernel in Section 
Seven had no killing vector.” 

“I’m sure he did,” said Bryson 
tartly. “Now perhaps you’ll tell me 

KILLING VECTOR 



what a killing vector is.” 

“Well, Mac could tell you a lot 
better than I can. But a killing vec- 
tor is a standard sort of thing in rel- 
ativity ... I guess you never had 
any training in that. You get a kill- 
ing vector when a region of space- 
time has some sort of symmetry — 
say, about an axis of spin. And 
every sort of black hole, every sort 
of kernel we’ve ever encountered 
before, has at least one symmetry of 
that type. So if McAndrew had 
changed the kernel and made it into 
something with no killing vector, 
it’s like no kernel we’ve ever seen. 
Right, Mac?” 

He looked dreamy. The drugs 
had taken hold. “I took it past the 
extreme Kerr-Newman form,” he 
said. “Put it into a different form, 
metastable equilibrium. Event hori- 
zon had disappeared; all the killing 
vectors had disappeared.” 

“Christ!” I hadn’t expected that. 
“No event horizon? Doesn’t that 
mean that you get — ?” 

McAndrew was still nodding, his 
pupils dilated. “ — a naked singular- 
ity. That’s right. Captain. I had a 
singularity sitting there in equilib- 
rium in Section Seven. You don’t 
get there by spinning-up . need 
different method.” His speech was 
slurring, as though his tongue were 
swollen. “Didn’t know what would 
happen if somebody tried to tap it, 
to use for a drive. Either the signa- 
ture of space-time there would 
change, from three space dimen- 
sions and one time to two space and 
two time. Or we might see the Sys- 
tem’s biggest explosion. All the 
mass coming out as radiation, in 
one flash.” 

It was slowly dawning on Bryson 

79 




what we were saying. “But just 
where is Yifter now?” he asked. 

“Gone a long way,” I said. 
“Right out of this universe.” 

“And he can’t be brought back?” 
asked Bryson. 

“I hope not.” I had seen more 
than enough of Yifter. 

“But I’m supposed to deliver him 
safely to Titan,” said Bryson. “I’m 
responsible for his safe passage. 
What am I going to tell the Plane- 
tary Coordinators?” 

I didn’t have too much sympathy. 
I was busy looking at Me Andrew’s 
wounds. The fingers could be re- 
generated, using the bio-feedback 
equipment on Titan, but the lung 
would need watching. It was still 
bleeding a little. 

“Tell them you had a very singu- 
lar experience,” I said. McAndrew 
grunted as I probed the deep cut in 



his side. “Sorry, Mac. Have to do 
it. You know, you’ve ruined your 
reputation forever as far as I’m con- 
cerned. I thought you were a 
pacifist. All that preaching at us, 
then you send Yifter and his lot all 
the way to Hell — and good riddance 
to them.” 

McAndrew was drifting far away 
on his big dose of pain-killer. He 
half-winked at me and made his 
curious throat-clearing noise. 

“Och, I’m a pacifist all right. 
We pacifists have to look after each 
other. How could we ever hope for 
peace with people like Yifter around 
to stir up trouble? There’s a bunch 
more of them, a few hours’ travel 
behind us. Fix me up quick. I 
should be tinkering with the other 
kernels a bit, just in case the other 
Lucies decide to pay us a visit lat- 
er. ...” ★

For two thousand years the mri 
species has supported itself by hir- 
ing out its warrior-caste, the Kel, to 
the regul species as guards and 
mercenaries. 

Forty-three years ago the regul 
went to war against humankind, 
and the regul doch, or Association 
of Holn, launched mri mercenaries 
into that conflict. The mri lost, due 
to their declining numbers and due 
also to regul control of strategy. 
The mri homeworld of Nisren was 
destroyed, and world after world 
has fallen to humanity until only 
remote Kesrith remains mri. It is 
now called homeworld for the mri 
forces scattered throughout space, 
but its present mri inhabitants 
number only thirteen: the she’pan, 
Intel, who rules: two of Sen-caste, 
the scholars: and ten kel’ein, or 
warriors. 

In the peace negotiations Holn is 
replaced in command by doch 
Alagn, and in the resulting treaty 
Kesrith is traded to humanity. 
Evacuation of regul personnel from 
Kesrith begins in frantic haste. 

But the thirteen mri sit firm, ig- 
nored by the fleeing Holn; and the 
youngest kel’en, Niun, is full of bit- 
terness for their fate. Nine of the 
kel’ein are old, masters of their 
caste; Niun alone — last son of the 
mri, the People, as they call 
themselves — has been forbidden to 
go into space. He has prepared all 
his life for this war; now his world 
is being taken, and still he is for- 
bidden to seek a kel’en’s employ- 
ment with the regul. His truesister 
Melein, of Sen-caste, tries to inter- 
cede for him, reminding Intel of the 
bitter quarrel between Niun and his 
cousin Medai, who was sent in 



honor to the war, while Niun was 
held at home. 

Intel will not be persuaded, and 
Niun is again forbidden to leave 
Kesrith. 

★ ★ ★ 

Elsewhere in Kesrith’s system a 
ship is incoming: The doch Alagn 
elder, Hulagh Alagn-ni, is bringing 
in two humans-Stavros, governor- 
to-be of human Kesrith, and his 
aide, Sten Duncan, a Surface Tacti- 
cal operative. 

Considerable physical differences 
separate regul and human. The 
regul’ s immature phase alone is 
mobile, while their adult phase con- 
fines them to reliance upon pros- 
thetic devices. But the mental dif- 
ferences are more extreme. The 
regul learn at a single hearing and 
cannot forget. They were at disad- 
vantage in war . but they trust in 
their mental superiority and reckon 
to ultimately outmaneuver the two 
human observers. Stavros obeys the 
rigid schedule of movements permit- 
ted them aboard ship, but his aide 
strays and finds himself face to face 
with a mri kel’ en . who says 
simply, “/ am kel Medai,” and 
adds: We should not have met.” 

Regul separate them, mri and 
human, and Duncan and Stavros 
are confined strictly to quarters 
until landing at Kesrith. 

And after landing they are taken 
to the Nom‘, regul headquarters, 
under a heavy guard ostensibly for 
their protection, while Medai’ s body 
is taken by a' regul delegation to the 
edun, the House of the mri. 

Suicide is the given cause of 
Medai’ s death, suicide occasioned 



THE FADED SUN

by long brooding over the loss of 
the war and by Hulagh’s ban on 
personnel leaving the ship. The mri 
Kel accepts the body, and as the 
kel’en next of kin, Niun sits the 
death-watch alone in the Shrine. 
There Melein appears, to tell him 
that Intel wants him upstairs. 

Niun, blaming Intel for the 
policies that have caused himself 
and Medai such grief, refuses the 
order, insisting that he will see 
Medai buried, with full honors, in 
the distant desert tombs. Melein 
leaves in anger. 

And during that long watch, Niun 
finds himself confronted by a scar- 
red, starved dus, one of the great 
quadrupeds, native to Kesrith, that 
have lived with the mri and gone to 
war with them for all known time. 
The beast is half-blind with the se- 
cretions of miuk, the madness that 
sometimes possesses them. Niun ex- 
pects to be killed, but the beast re- 
treats, to lie at the door outside the 
edun. 

Then Niun recognizes it — the dus 
that had gone to war with Medai, 
returned abused and starved and far 
into a madness that would have 
been days in the making. 

The mri were not, then, given all 
the truth concerning Medai’ s death. 

VIII 

Niun had begun, before the 
others had even stirred, to prepare 
for the journey to Sil’athen. There 
was the water drawn and the ritual 
store of food, a token only, and the 
real provisions that were for the liv- 
ing. 

With much effort he took the 
body of Medai from the small 

84 



Shrine and bound it with cords to 
the regul litter on which it had 
come. The dus that waited by the 
doorway saw but paid no heed to 
what he did. 

Then the others began to come: 
Eddan and Pasev and Dahacha and 
the rest of the Kel. The dusei came 
down too, and the miuk’ko by the 
door withdrew a space. There in the 
sunlight it subsided, massive head 
between its paws, sides heaving. It 
was deep in shock. 

“Miuk,” murmured Debas, hor- 
rified to see what sat at their gates. 

But Pasev, who was, despite the 
fact that she had killed many hu- 
mans, a gentle soul, went closer 
and tried to call to it, staying out of 
its reach. It reared aside with a 
plaint of rage and sank down again 
a little distance away, exhausted by 
the effort. The dusei of the edun 
drew aside from it, agitated, sensing 
the distress of their fellow and the 
danger he posed. They formed a 
tight knot about the Kel, and the 
guard-dus commenced that circling 
action, protecting the Kel from the 
threat of the rogue. 

And eyes were on Niun, question- 
ing. He shrugged and picked up the 
ropes of Medai’s improvised sled. 

“It came,” he said, “into the 
Shrine last night.” He looked at 
Eddan. “It was hunting someone.” 

And he saw the ugly surmise that 
leaped into the Kel’anth’s eyes: a 
wise man, Eddan, if he were not 
kel’en. And quietly Eddan turned 
and gestured to Pasev, to Liran and 
Debas and Lieth. 

“Stay here,” he said. “Guard 
the she’pan.” 

“Eddan,” said Pasev, the 
she’pan forbade — ” 



GALAXY 




"Any who wish to stay besides 
these may stay. Guard the she’pan, 
Pasev.” 

And Niun, not waiting for them, 
started out, knowing already by the 
resistance of the sled that he was 
going to pay dearly for his obsti- 
nacy, unyielding when the she’pan 
and all the rest had given him a 
way to escape this kinsman’s duty. 

Slowly, painfully, the miuk’ko 
heaved itself up and tried to follow 
the sled. It went only as far as the 
roadway and there sank down, 
exhausted, at the end of its strength. 

The other dusei flanked it, one 
still pacing between the dus and the 
remaining Kel, watching the rogue. 
They did not follow the burial 
party. They were not wanted. They 
guarded the edun. 

And Eddan and the other kel’ein 
overtook Niun on the slope that led 
to the hills and offered their hands 
to the rope. He did not object to 
this. He felt pained that they must 
make this gesture, showing him 
their fellowship, as if it needed be 
shown. 

He veiled himself, one-handed, 
lowered the visor, already conserv- 
ing the moisture his panting breaths 
tended to waste. He had taken along 
more than the usual quota of water, 
knowing the toll the journey would 
exact of them. One did not work on 
Kesrith: This was for youngling 
regul and for regul machines. With- 
out proper caution, exertion would 
wring the moisture from the body 
and bring hemorrhage. 

But none of them said the obvi- 
ous, that the journey was ill- 
advised. 

Never had the Kel defied the 
Mother, never directly. 



And it came to Niun then that the 
Mother had had recourse available: 
She might have summarily ordered 
Eddan. She had not done this. 

Uncharitably he attributed her 
thoughts not to love but to the 
drinking again of komal, wherefore 
she could not be awakened when 
Melein had taken his refusal back to 
her. Such was Intel, she’pan of 
Kesrith. It had happened before. 

He held to this irreverent anger, 
refusing to believe that she had re- 
lented, for this, at least, had never 
happened before, not in all the 
years that he had made requests of 
her. He did not think that she would 
begin, now that he defied her. 

He refused to repent his stub- 
bornness even when the trail grew 
steeper and the rocks tormented his 
feet and the air came like cold fire 
into his lungs. 

In the sky the regul ships con- 
tinued to come and go, their speed 
making mock of the slow agony of 
the small figures of mri — ships car- 
rying more and more of regul-kind 
into refuge before humans should 
come and claim the world. 

* ★ ★ ★ 

The trail to Sil’athen was no trail 
but a way. remembered by all mri 
that had ever walked it. There was 
no real trace of a path among the 
rocks save that the way was devoid 
of large obstacles and tended to run 
from landmark to landmark. Niun 
knew it, for burials had been com- 
mon enough his his life, although 
he had never seen the ceremonies 
surrounding a birth. He had been 
too young for Melein’s. He drew on 
the sled’s ropes alone now, follow- 



THE FADED SUN

ing after Eddan’s tall, slim figure. 
He wrestled the sled along among 
the small rocks until he had to wrap 
a fold of his robes about his tom 
hands to save them. His breath 
came hard and his lungs ached; he 
was accustomed to weapons-work, 
not to labor like tsi’mri; and every 
few paces of altitude gained made 
breathing that much more difficult. 

“Niun,” one and another of the 
brothers would say, “Let me take it 
a time.” But he shook off their 
offering hands. Only the oldest — 
save Pasev, whom Eddan had 
placed in command back at the 
edun — had come on this trek. His 
conscience tormented him now, lest 
his stubbornness might prove the 
death of one of these brave old 
men. And surely, he thought, the 
she ’pan had foreseen this and he 
had been too blind with his own 
self-importance to consider that her 
reasons might not have involved 
him. He had thought the worst of 
Medai and repented it now; it began 
to dawn on him that he might have 
been mistaken in other things. 

But it would shame these men 
now, having begun, to turn back. 
He had brought them out here, he 
with his stubborn pride; he wel- 
comed the pain that drove clear 
thought from his mind, atonement 
for his pettiness against them, 
against the dead. Medai had been 
no coward, no man light-of-thought. 
Niun was certain of that now, cer- 
tain that his cousin had held strong 
for a long time, strong against the 
perfidy of his masters, against the 
Gods knew what else. 

And why these things had been: 
This was still beyond him. 

“Eddan,” he said quietly when 



they rested in the shadow of a high 
crag, the sand beyond them rippling 
in the ruddy light of Arain’s zenith. 
A burrower had his lair out on the 
flat beyond. Niun had seen it pock 
the surface, the sand funnelling 
down as the creature reacted to the 
breeze, thinking it had prey. 

“Ai?” 

“I think you believe Medai’s 
death was not as the regul said.” 

Eddan, veiled, moved his hand, a 
gesture that agreed. 

“I think,” Niun continued, “that 
the Kel has already discussed this, 
and that I was probably the only 
one in the Kel who was surprised to 
find that so.” 

Eddan looked at him long. The 
membrane nictitated across his eyes, 
flashed clear again. “Niun,” he 
said, “that is an uncharitable thing, 
to assume that we would willfully 
exclude you from our thoughts in 
such a matter.” 

“But perhaps it is so, sir. 
Perhaps you had reasons.” 

Eddan’s hand closed on Niun’s 
wrist, a hard grip. Eddan had taught 
him the yin’ein; there was none 
more skillful than Eddan and Pasev, 
able to divide a man body from soul 
with delicacy; one could not see the 
blade move. And the strength was 
still in his hand. 

“Do not look to serve regul, 
Niun s’lntel Zain-Abrin. You serve 
the she ’pan, and one day you will 
be in my place. I think that day is 
coming soon.” 

“If I should become Kel’anth,” 
said Niun, turning cold at the words 
of omen, and unsure what he meant 
by that, “it will be a very small 
Kel. Everyone else is senior to 
me.” 



86 



GALAXY 




“You will have your honor, 
Niun. There was never doubt of this 
in our minds, only in yours. It will 
come.” 

Niun was disturbed to the heart 
by the deadly urgency of the words, 
at Eddan’s pressing this upon him. 
“I have never fought,” he objected. 
“How am I fit for anything?” 

Eddan shrugged again. “We are 
the Hand; others do the planning. 
But be assured that you have a use 
and that the she ’pan has planned for 
it. Remember that. Medai was con- 
sidered and rejected. Remember that 
too.” 

Niun sat stunned, all his surmises 
lorn down and laid waste at once. 
“Sir,” he said, but Eddan thrust 
away from him and rose, turning 
his face from him, making it plain 
that he wanted no further question 
on the matter. Niun too rose to his 
feet, seeking some way to ask, let- 
ting his hand fall, helpless. When 
Eddan would not answer, he would 
not answer, and quite probably 
Eddan had said all he could say, all 
that he knew to say. 

The she’ pan is well-pleased with 
his death, Melein had said; the cold- 
ness of that still chilled him. And: 
Medai was considered and rejected, 
Eddan had told him. 

For the first time in his life he 
pitied his cousin; for he saw every- 
thing turned inside out. 

Himself, in his youthful jealousy, 
suspicious of Medai, whose crime 
had been only that he had looked on 
Melein, for whom the she’pan had 
planned otherwise. Kesrith was a 
hard and unforgiving world. The 
Mother of Kesrith was one with her 
world, without mercies. 

His own stubbornness had run 



counter to her will. He had defied 
her, knowing nothing of her 
reasons. He had done a thing that 
kel’ein did not do and, further, 
tested her resolve to stop him, at a 
time when the People could least af- 
ford division. 

It was possible, he thought, that 
not alone had the regul killed 
Medai — that the she’pan, and even 
Melein, had had a part in it. 

He pitied Medai, fearing for him- 
self. He would have wished to 
have spoken with his cousin, both 
of them men now, and to have 
learned of Medai the things Eddan 
could not tell him. He looked at the 
black-shrouded form on the litter as 
he took up the ropes again and 
found that all his confidences had 
left him. 

He need not have been alone 
these years, he thought suddenly, 
and Medai need not have died, and 
so many things need not have hap- 
pened, had he not made the she’pan 
choose between them. * 

It was not alone the regul that 
had killed Medai. 

It was evening when they reached 
the holy place, thfe cliffs, the windy 
recesses where the caves of 
Sil’athen hid the dead of the People 
that had died away from sun-burial. 
There were many, many graves, the 
oldest dating from times before 
Kesrith had known regul, the latest 
holding those that had been born on 
Nisren and had fled here for refuge. 

The valley formed a long retreat 
between the cliffs that marked a 
new level of the uplands. Here the 
sands were red, in contrast to the 
pale lowlands, and the ruddy rock 
was banded in places with white. 
Where rock had formed a hard cap. 



THE FADED SUN 



87 




erosion by wind and burning rains 
had made strange pillars and hulk- 
ing shapes that guarded the way 
through Sil’athen, casting strange 
shadows in the setting light of 
ruddy Arain. A windflower oc- 
cupied one of the crags; its tendrils 
glistened like threads of glass, 
scarlet-stained, in the sunset. On the 
left of the entry a burrower had 
laired for many years. They swung 
wide, avoiding this guardian. 

It was shaming to stumble here, 
at the end: Niun felt the sand shift 
underfoot and caught himself, fear- 
ing at first a smaller burrower, un- 
detected; but it was an old hole, 
only soft sand. He gathered himself 
up, dusting the knee on which he 
had fallen, and leaned against the 
ropes, shaking off the several 
offered hands. There was a black 
shadow over his vision, tinged with 
red: the membrane half-closed, no 
longer responsive to conscious will. 
The air he breathed was salty with 
his own evaporating moisture. 

They passed the old graves, the 
thousands of the old Kath, here 
long before the regul. Then there 
were the lonely twelve of their own 
Kath, buried westward according to 
tradition, facing the rising sun, 
dawning hope. They were the 
child-bearers, and with them were 
buried the few sad children, those 
too gentle for Kesrith’s harsh 
winds. Theirs were the lives that 
should have preserved the People, 
had Intel not chosen Kesrith for 
homeworld. Many worlds the regul 
had offered — fair, green worlds — 
but Intel had desired Kesrith. She 
had told them this. The forge of a 
new people, she had said of Kes- 
rith. But the gentle Kath had died in 

88 



that forging, leaving the People 
desolate. 

Facing the sun’s setting were the 
Sen graves in their thousands; and 
the nineteen recent graves of their | 
own Sen. These also, in their way 
gentle and vulnerable, had failed in 
Intel’s refining, leaving Melein and 
Sathell alone to serve. 

In the highest cliffs were the 
graves of she’panei and the kel’ein I 
who guarded them in death. It was 
not certain how many she’panei had 
been on Kesrith. Niun knew of 
fifty-nine. He also knew that no 
kel’en knew a whole truth. He 
thought on this through the red and 
black haze of other thoughts as they 
turned toward the graves of the Kel. 

There were only a few hundred 
such to the others’ thousands, al- 
most as few as the graves of the 
she’panei — on Kesrith. Their dead 
would many times outnumber those 
of the Sen; but very, very few 
kel’ein found their graves in earth, j 

They stopped at the newest cave, 
where the veterans of Nisren were 
entombed; and Niun forced himself 
to stay on his feet, to help them in 
unsealing it, moving rock until his 
hands were numb, for these stub- 
born old men would do everything j 
themselves if he did not forestall 
them. He ached and his own blood 
was on the rocks with which he 
made place for Medai. 

Kel’ein were not buried like 
others. Other castes faced into the 
valley of Sil’athen, but the Kel 
faced outward, toward the north, 
the traditional direction of evil. 
Row on row the dead lay in the 
dark. When they lit their single 
lamp, they could see them, musty 
black shadows in veils and robes 



GALAXY 



mouldering into ruin, veiled faces 
turned toward the north wall of the 
cave. 

The air inside was cold and 
strange with decay. The dark op- 
pressed. Niun stood, content for a 
moment only to stand, quiet, and let 
the old men set Medai in place 
among the others. They gathered 
then and faced north and spoke over 
him the Shon’jir, the passing-ritual. 
Niun repeated the words, spoken at 
birthings and burials, heralding a 
life of the People into the world and 
out of it. 

From Dark beginning 
To Dark at ending, 

Between them a Sun, 

But after comes Dark, 

And in that Dark, 

One ending. 

The words echoed in the cavern, 
in darkness wrapped about them; 
and Niun looked at the dead, and at 
his companions, and considered the 
frailty of they that chanted of the 
Dark; and the fragile breath’s dif- 
ference between lips that moved and 
those that could not. Terror pos- 
sessed him, rebellion, tempting him 
to rush out into the open; but he did 
not give way. His lips continued to 
form the words. 

From Dark to Dark 
Is one voyage. 

From Dark to Dark 
Is our voyage. 

And after the Dark, 

O brothers, O sisters, 

Come we home. 

He had never thought the words. 
He had mouthed them; he had never 



felt them. He felt them now, look- 
ing about him. 

Home. 

This. 

He held himself still while the 
others filed out, forced himself to 
be the last, mastering his fear; but 
even when he had the light of stars 
and Kesrith’s first moon overhead, 
he felt within him that cold that 
many suns would never warm 
away. 

“Seal it,” said Eddan. 

He gathered up the rocks one by 
one and fitted them into place, mak- 
ing tight their joinings, sealing them 
between himself and Medai. His 
breath came hard. He found himself 
with tears flooding his cheeks for 
his shame before Medai. 

Not like you, cousin, not like 
you, he kept thinking, as he set 
each stone in place, a determina- 
tion, a wall that he built, a protec- 
tion for the hallowed dead against 
the winds and the sands and the 
prying fingers of the suruin that 
ranged the high hills; a protection 
for himself, barring the truth inside. 

And they were done, - all debts 
paid. The brothers blew dust upon 
the wind; he gathered up his hand- 
ful and did likewise, bidding 
farewell. Then they rested a time 
before beginning the long, hard trek 
back to the edun. 

Soah joined the first moon over- 
head, making their passage safer, 
and they set forth. Eddan went first, 
using his staff to probe for wind- 
flowers in the dark air, wary as 
those who walked the wilds of Kes- 
rith dus-less had to be; but Niun 
lent his company to Sirain, who 
was half-blind and very frail, and 
too proud to accept help. Often 



THE FADED SUN 



89 




Niun gave way to exhaustion him- 
self to slow their progress, as if the 
sores on his hands and the long 
walk and the sleeplessness had ut- 
terly undone him; but of a sudden 
pride was not important to him. It 
was only important that Sirain’s 
pride be saved, that he not die. 
Niun did not flaunt his youth at 
them any longer. He found com- 
radeship with them, as if they and 
he had finally understood a thing 
that he should have understood long 
ago. 

They shared water and food 
together — sat, the six of them, in 
the dark after the moons had set, 
and broke fast; and the brothers 
were sorry for his hands and offered 
of their own experience various ad- 
vice to heal them. But Eddan cut 
the stalk of a young luin and rubbed 
the juice of it on the sores, a rem- 
edy counted sovereign for every 
wound. It eased the pain. 

In the journey after that the pace 
was slower still, and perhaps Sirain 
had seen through his careful pre- 
tence from the beginning, for at last 
he clasped Niun’s arm in a feeble 
grip and admitted that this time it 
was himself who must rest a time. 

By such degrees they came 
homeward. 

And it was evening again when 
they returned, and the edun’s entry 
was lit for them and the great bulk 
of the ailing dus still was to be seen 
at the door. 

In the end there was no hurrying. 
Niun had been anxious lest he have 
to take up Sirain and carry him, 
which would have been a crushing 
shame to the old warrior. And for 
Sirain’s sake, and for Eddan’s, who 
labored now, they walked slowly. 



Their anxiety to reach the edun, 
their dread of things that might have 
gone amiss in their absence, 
weighed heavily upon them. 

But there in the doorway Melein 
waited, and gave them gentle wel- 
come, unveiled, as they unveiled 
themselves, coming home. 

“Is all well,” she said. “Come 
in. Be at ease.” 

They entered, footsore and cold, 
and passed the long hall to the 
Shrine, that first of all, making their 
individual prayers, then the washing 
of the hands and face. And when 
they were done, they turned toward 
the steps of the Kel-tower, for they 
were exhausted. 

But Melein waited, outside the 
Shrine. 

“Niun,” she said. “The Mother 
still sends for you.” 

He was tired. He dreaded the 
meeting. He turned his shoulder to 
her rudely and walked out of the 
hall, to the step, to see how the dus 
fared. He gave it a scrap of meat 
that he had saved from his own ra- 
tions on the journey; but someone 
else had filled the pannikin with wa- 
ter. 

It turned from his gift, and would 
have none of him. He had thought 
that this would be the case, but he 
had trifed. He sank down in exhaus- 
tion on the step and stared at the 
dus helplessly. 

Never would the beasts tolerate 
him, and this one, bereaved and 
suffering, he could not help. 

He gave a great sigh that was al- 
most a sob and stared at his bloody 
hands in the light, so sensitive, so 
delicate to wield the yin’ein, and 
reduced to this. There was no war- 
rior here, none that the dus could 



90 



GALAXY 




detect. It chose to die, like Medai. 
It found nothing in him to interest it 
in living. 

He had the seta al and the 
weapons and the black robes; he 
had the skill; but the heart in him 
was terrified; and angry; and the 
dus, being sensitive to such things, 
would not have him. 

He swept off mez and zaidhe, 
bundled them into the crook of his 
arm; and with his right hand he 
gathered a handful of dust from the 
side of the step and smeared his 
brow with it, a penance for his 
jealousy. 

Then he went inside, ascended 
the stairs of the inmost tower, that 
of the she ’pan. He opened the door 
to the she’pan’s hall cautiously and 
saw that Melein knelt at the 
she’pan’s left hand, arranging the 
cushions. 

“Hush,” said Melein, accusing 
him with her eyes. “She has just 
now fallen asleep. You are too late 
tonight. Be still.” 

But the she’pan stirred as he 
came near her, and her golden eyes 
opened and the membrane receded, 
leaving them clear. 

“Niun,” she said softly. 

“Little Mother.” He sank down 
on her right and offered his bowed 
head to her gentle touch, an inti- 
macy the Kel offered no others but 
the she’pan or a mate. Her hands 
were warm against the chill of his 
skin. 

“You are safe,” she said. “You 
are back safely.” And as if that 
were all the burden of what she de- 
sired, like a child sleeping with a 
favorite toy at hand, she settled 
back into her dreams. 

Niun remained still, leaned his 



head against the arm of her chair, 
and gradually gave himself to sleep, 
her hand still resting on his shoul- 
der. His dreams were troubled. At 
times he woke, seeing the cave and 
the dark; and then he saw the 
golden light that surrounded him, 
and felt the weight of the she’pan’s 
hand, and knew where he was. 

She dreamed, did the Mother, 
and reclaimed him; possibly she 
confused him with another. He did 
not know. He was kel’en, like the 
other. He sat at her side and slept at 
times and knew that the sum of his 
duty to her was to live, to stay by 
her. She had rejected Medai, and 
never from her had come a word of 
regret, of sorrow, for him. 

You are safe, she had said. 

The bonds, so lately slipped, en- 
snared him again; and at last he 
gave up his struggle and knew that 
he must serve the service that had 
claimed him. 

The su-she’pani kel’en a’anu. 

The she’pan’s kel’en, like those 
in the cliffs. 

In the whispered long-ago days, 
when there w^s no war, there had 
been such, when mri fought against 
mri and House against House, when 
she’pan contended against she’pan. 

Her last' kel’en, the one — he 
foresaw with what he thought was a 
true vision — that would never in- 
deed know the Dark of the caves of 
Sil’athen: the one to seal the barrier 
for the others, and to remain out- 
side, a guardian. 

He slid a glance toward Melein, 
saw her awake also, her eyes star- 
ing into the shadows: He realized 
what it had surely been for her, 
alone here, with Intel. 

For her also, he was afraid.

It was, in the Nom, the twentieth 
day. 

It was possible finally for human 
nerves to adjust to Kesri th’s longer 
day. Duncan rose and wandered to 
the private bath — that luxury at least 
their onworld accommodations had 
afforded him, although he must con- 
tent himself with the recycled ration 
of water available within the Norn’s 
apparatus. 

The Nom depended entirely on 
life-support systems such as those 
of a ship. Regul did not find surface 
existence comfortable, although it 
was tolerable. 

Neither was it, he suspected, 
comfortable for humans. 

Filtered air, recycled water — the 
latter originally reclaimed from a 
sea so laden with alkali that nothing 
would live in it. The world's scant 
animal life was confined to the up- 
lands, and from what information 
he had obtained from the translated 
regul advisories on the matter, there 
was little born of Kesrith that was 
harmless. 

The interior of the Nom held gar- 
dens that somewhat humidified the 
air and provided a certain pleasant- 
ness, but the alien harshness of the 
foliage and the accompanying scent 
of regul made the gardens less 
gracious than they might have been. 

He was, he reckoned, growing 
used to regul. He was learning to 
tolerate a number of things he had 
once thought impossible to accept, 
and that in twenty days of close 
contact. 

And it was close contact. There 
were no restricted hours, no con- 
finement to quarters, but the regula- 

92 



tions forbade them to leave the 
Nom at any time. Stavros, of 
course, would not do so anyway as 
long as regul remained on Kesrith. 
It was a reasonably brief time to 
wait: ten days until the first human 
ships should come in and replace 
the regul. 

Duncan anticipated, at least, that 
their sanity might hold that long. 
He had a mental image of their first 
encounter with those humans incom- 
ing; of the landing party finding 
them each changed, bizarre and al- 
tered by their stay on Kesrith. He 
was not the man that had begun the 
voyage; SurTac Sten Duncan on 
Haven had been capable of far more 
impulsive behavior than was Sten 
Duncan, aide to the new governor 
of Kesrith. He had acquired pa- 
tience, the ability to reckon slowly; 
and he had acquired something of 
regul manners, ponderous and un- 
wieldy as their conventions were. 
They began to come as naturally as 
yes, sir, and no, sir; Favor, my 
lord; be gracious, elder. 

They had promised him retire- 
ment after five years; but five years 
in this sullen environment would 
make him unfit for human com- 
pany; five years from now he might 
find clean air a novelty and Haven 
daylight strange to the eyes: he 
might find human manners banal 
and odd after the stark, survival- 
oriented settlement that men would 
have to make of Kesrith. He was in 
the process of adapting. Any opera- 
tion on any world, in any 
climate — in any hostile terrain — that 
required human hands directly at 
work onworld was a SurTac’s natu- 
ral job, and he was learning the feel 
of Kesrith. 



GALAXY 




Stavros was doing the same thing 
in his intellectual way, absorbing 
every oddity within his reach — like 
the regul, never seeming to need 
notes, simply looking and listening 
on his rare excursions from his 
room to the gardens. 

This morning he had an appoint- 
ment in Hulagh’s offices. It was an 
important occasion. 

Something rumbled outside, a 
sound different than the accustomed 
thunder of departing ships. Duncan 
switched the view to let light 
through the Norn’s black windows. 
They could see the whole horizon, 
from the sea at the right to the hills 
at the left, save that they could not 
see the mri edun nor the port, the 
two sites in which they had the 
greatest interest. It was, of course, 
no accident that their view was 
thus. Nothing in the desolation that 



lay before them had altered in 
twenty days but now, above the 
hills, there was a change. A storm 
was moving in, the clouds gray, 
red-tinged, shadowing the sea in 
one quarter. Lightnings flashed with 
impossible radpidity. 

The weather, said the prepared 
statements of the bai’s staff, is un- 
predictable by season, and occa- 
sionally violent. The rain is mildly 
caustic, especially in showers fol- 
lowing duststorms . It will be desir- 
able to bathe if one is caught in the 
rain. Above all. it is necessary to 
seek suitable cover at the earliest 
indication of a storm. The winds 
can achieve considerable force. 
When fronts converge on the sea- 
ward and hillward sides, cyclonic- 
action is frequent. 

The red light in the ceiling mount 
flared, summoning him. Stavros 



THE FADED SUN

was awake. Duncan quickly ob- 
tained a cup of soi from the wall 
dispenser — soi being the regul 
liquid stimulant, and only mildly 
flavored, unlike most regul foods. It 
was one of the few regul graces 
they had come to enjoy. A touch of 
sweetener made it completely palat- 
able. He added the two drops, set 
the cup on a small tray, gathered 
the morning dispatches from the slot 
and carried the offering in to Stav- 
ros’ quarters — again accessible only 
from his own apartment. 

“Good morning, sir,” he mur- 
mured, a courtesy which was regu- 
larly answered with only a civil 
nod, and sometimes that belated. 
Stavros was in exceptional spirits 
this morning. He actually smiled, a 
gesture that made his thin mouth the 
tighter. 

“Do the windows,” Stavros said. 
It was thundering again. 

Duncan switched them over and 
let in the day’s sullen light. 

The first drops began to spatter 
the dust on the panes. A crack of 
thunder made the glass bow and rat- 
tle, and Stavros walked over to 
enjoy the view. Duncan himself felt 
a heightening of senses, a stimula- 
tion unaccustomed in their carefully 
controlled environment. This was 
something the regul could not 
schedule or censor, the violence of 
nature. He could see the storm 
sweep down on the sea, where the 
waves whitecapped, dyed pink. The 
whole day was enveloped in reddish 
murk, and fitful with lightnings. 

"This,” said Stavros, “is going 
to be one of the major obstacles to 
settlement here.” 

Duncan felt he was called upon 
to discuss the matter. He did not 

94 



know precisely how; his training 
was not in civilizing worlds, but in 
taking them. 

"The regul gave us an edge 
there,” he said, “with this city for 
a base.” 

“There’s a considerable attrition 
in machinery on Kesrith, so I’m 
told; and for some idiotic reason, 
they’ve followed the mri example 
and built a number of outposts out 
of rammed earth and binder. It’s 
cheap but remarkably unsuited for 
the climate.” 

“If you have a lot of labor, you 
can keep rebuilding, I suppose.” 

“Humans can’t run a colony that 
way.” 

Stavros went off on another tan- 
gent of thought, sipping at the 
warm drink. Thunder rattled the 
glass again. Wind hit with a force 
that sent a sheet of water between 
them and the world, obscuring ev- 
erything that lay beyond. Duncan 
swore in surprise and awe. 

"The storm shields,” Stavros ad- 
vised him. It was hailing now, a 
rapid patter that threatened the win- 
dows. It came toward them, from 
their direction. 

Duncan quickly activated the 
shutters. They closed across, tight, 
and cut off the daylight: The room 
lights compensated. Then he hurried 
back to see to the windows in his 
own quarters, appalled, afraid 
even to approach the glass under 
the violence that battered against it. 

Thunder broke overhead as he 
reached for the switch, his heart 
pounding. The storm shield slid 
over the window, and distantly he 
could hear an alarm in the building; 
for a moment the hiss of air of air 
in the ducts ceased and he felt a 



GALAXY 




pressure in his ears, like sudden as- 
cent in an aircraft. 

He went to the door, opened it. 
Regul were whisking about in sleds 
along the corridors, in mad confu- 
sion. The pressure in his ears was 
eased then, and he heard a sound 
that was too deep for sound, a 
shuddering that went through the 
building. 

“Nai chiug-ar?” . what is 
it? . he asked the first regul he 
saw afoot. “Nai chiug-ar?” 

“ Sak noi kanuchdi hoc-nar the 
youngling spat back, words that had 
something to do with the port, but 
nothing else he could understand. 
“Sa-ak toe dac” it hissed at him 
then. Keep to quarters, favor. 

Duncan retreated, closed the door 
and called the main desk for infor- 
mation. No one would respond to 
his calls. Eventually the world 
seemed to grow calm outside; only 
a rush of rain beat against the storm 
shields. He ventured finally to open 
the shields and saw nothing but a 
wash of water, distorting everything 
outside. He closed them again. 

And from Stavros’ room, long 
silence. 

He gathered together his shaken 
faculties, berating himself for his 
panic, and went in to see about the 
old man, expecting cynical 
amusement at a SurTac who feared 
storms. 

The cup was on the floor, a 
brown stain on the carpet. He saw 
the old man lying half across the 
bed, still in his nightclothes. 

“Sir?” he exclaimed. He went 
nearer and touched Stavros’ shoul- 
der fearfully, then turned him over 
and obtained faint movement, a 
gasp for breath, a flutter of the right 



eye. The left remained drawn, that 
side of the mouth peculiarly dis- 
torted. Stavros tried to talk to him, 
the sounds unintelligible. 

In the next instant Duncan ran 
from the room, through his quarters 
into the hall and to the duty desk, 
where he tried every word that 
would come to mind to express his 
need. 

“Stavros,” he said at last. 
“Stavros!” and this finally seemed 
to impress itself on the youngling. 
It rose, lumbering in its gait, and 
came with him. 

It stood, for a considerable time, 
at the foot of the bed. “Elder,” it 
said finally, with the regul equiva- 
lent of a shrug. Here was an elder. 
It did not seem capable of rising; 
this was natural for an elder. Dun- 
can seized its massive arm and 
raised his voice. 

“Sick,” he insisted. 

Slowly, with ostentatious slow- 
ness, the youngling turned and went 
to the console, coded in a call and 
spoke to higher authority. 

Authority responded, in a bewil- 
dering patter of words. Duncan sank 
down and bowed his head into his 
hands, despair knotted in his 
stomach. 

And when an array of important 
regul arrived and began with dis- 
patch to load Stavros into one of the 
sled transports, Duncan hovered 
nearby constantly, insisting with 
forceful gestures that he intended to 
remain with Stavros. 

A regul seized him, firmly but 
without violence, and held him 
while the sled moved and departed. 
Then the regul released him. It was 
all the restraint that needed to have 
been applied; there was no way for 



THE FADED SUN 



95 




him to follow down that web of 
tracks. 

He sank into a chair in his quar- 
ters, shivering with anger and terror 
and utterly, utterly helpless to do 
anything for Stavros. 

Outside, the storm pattered 
against the shields. It continued for 
an hour or more. He left the room 
four times during that period to go 
down to the duty desk and demand 
information on Stavros’ condition, 
each time arming himself with 
applicable phrases from his diction- 
ary and lesson-sheets. 

The regul on duty had learned 
quickly enough that it need not be 
silent to express disdain; it needed 
only to shower words at him as 
rapidly as it could speak, impress- 
ing on him his incapacity to under- 
stand. 

“Dal,” it said finally, “seo- 
gin.” 

Go away. It repeated it several 
times. 

He turned away, headed not for 
the apartment but for the forbidden 
first-level ramp down which bai 
Hulagh had his offices. Words shrill- 
ed after him. A trio of regul closed 
in on him and marched him firmly 
enough to his door, pushing at him 
to make him enter. 

“Stavros sick,” one said finally. 

And that was the sum of informa- 
tion available until the morning, 
after an entire night in sleepless anx- 
iety. 

But with dawn they came in 
numbers and transferred a brown- 
wrapped bundle from a sled to the 
bed; and Duncan, roughly thrusting 
himself into their midst, saw Stav- 
ros conscious but yet with that 
deadness about his left side. 



And then there was deference in 
plenty among the younglings for a 
hum sounded at jhe door and a 
sled-console eased through the 
ample doorways to rest among 
them. 

Bai Hulagh. 

Words came from Stavros, dis- 
torted, unrecognizable in either lan- 
guage. 

“Honorable Stavros, rest now.” 
The bai rose within his sled with 
great effort and looked directly 
upon Duncan. “Youngling, the 
affliction is to the nervous system.” 

“Bai,” Duncan said, “help 
him.” 

The regul shrugged. “Human 
structure is strange to us. We re- 
gret. We are in the midst of consid- 
erable disaster. The storm toppled a 
tower at the port. There was great 
loss of life. Our facilities are 
strained by this emergency. Our in- 
formation on the human system is 
very scant.” 

“I can provide you ... I can 
provide you myself, bai, if your 
medics would — ” 

“Youngling,” said the regul, a 
basso profundo that vibrated with 
disdain, “we do not have informa- 
tion. We do not experiment on liv- 
ing beings. This moderate restora- 
tion of function we could accom- 
plish, no more. This is an elder of 
your people. He will be made com- 
fortable to the utmost of our 
abilities. Do you, youngling, ques- 
tion this statement?” 

“Be gracious,” Duncan mur- 
mured, reserving decisions to 
others; he moved to Stavros’ side, 
took the good hand in his. A mild 
pressure answered. Stavros’ pale 
eyes glittered wetly, alive, fully 



96 



GALAXY 




cognizant and trying to command 
him something. It was a stern and 
reprimanding look. Duncan tight- 
ened his hand in reassurance and 
looked up at the bai. 

"Favor, Reverence,” he said. “I 
am distressed for him. ” 

The bai .gestured him to come. 
He let slip Stavros’ fingers and did 
so, submitted to the touch of the 
regul bai, whose rough fingers 
rested on his shoulder, a considera- 
ble weight. 

The bai spoke curtly to his ser- 
vitors, who hastened about their 
business. Then the wrinkle-enfolded 
eyes looked into Duncan’s face, 
and the bai’s fingers tightened until 
it was hard not to wince. 

“Youngling, I am informed you 
have neglected food and drink. This 
is an expression of grief? This is re- 
ligion?” 

“No, Reverence, I will eat.” 

“Good.” The word rumbled 
forth, almost incomprehensible in 
its depth. The pressure increased 
until Duncan felt the joint give. He 
flinched. The bai dropped the hand 
at once. 

And then the bai turned ponder- 
ously and levered himself back into 
his sled, settled. The machine 
whined, backing, and turned and re- 
treated. 

Duncan stood and stared after it, 
after the others who withdrew al- 
most as quickly. A sound came 
from Stavros. 

“Sir?” he asked at once, trying 
to keep his voice natural. He turned 
and saw Stavros beckon toward the 
table. Stavros’ notes were there. He 
gathered them up and offered them, 
but Stavros with his right hand 
fumbled after the tablet only. Dun- 



can understood and found the pen to 
give him. He knelt down and 
braced the tablet as Stavros wrote, 
heavily, with childlike awkward- 
ness. 

Regul not upset, he read. Process 
with them natural to age. Mobility 
may return. No reason for panic. 
The awkward, slanted writing 
reached the accessible limits of the 
page. Duncan reversed the tablet, 
braced it higher. 

Humans due soon. Stavros re- 
sumed. Disaster at port — truth. 
Regul evacuation schedule ham- 
pered; Hazan damaged. Regul much 
concerned. Mri — need to find out 
what mri doing. This most urgent. 
Listen to regul talk, learn of mri, 
don’t provoke . 

“Leaving the Nom if I have to?” 

SurTac — now become diplomat. 
Careful. Take my instructions. 
Regul kill younglings here — many. 
Consult first on everything. Move 
me. Now. Console. 

Duncan did not want to move 
him; but Stavros cursed at him 
thickly and ordered him aloud, and 
evidently he was determined. Dun- 
can carefully, tenderly, gathered up 
the old man and placed him within 
the sled-console in the corner, sup- 
porting him, adjusting the form- 
fitting cushions to hold him secure- 
ly. Stavros’ right hand sought after 
controls, made further adjustments. 
The sled-console turned. The screen 
turned independently. A message, 
hand-keyed, crawled across the 
small screen. 

Can learn even this. 

“Yes, sir,” Duncan said with a 
tightness in his throat. He was sud- 
denly concerned for this man, for 
Stavros personally. 



THE FADED SUN 



97 




The message-crawl resumed. 
Order food for you. Rest. 

“And for yourself, sir?” 

Stavros turned the sled, jerkily 
maneuvered it to a position next the 
bed. He operated the console arm to 
dim the lights. I wait, the screen 
read. No needs.

“Truebrother.” 

Seated on the step beside the dus, 
Niun looked over his shoulder. It 
was seldom now that he met his sis- 
ter informally, brother and sister, 
daithen and daithe, as they had been 
before. She surprised him with, the 
dus. He was embarrassed to be 
found at this charity: there had been 
a distance between them, although 
they had been much together of re- 
cent in the she’pan’s hall. He did 
not like to be with her alone, not 
any longer. It was painful, that the 
closeness between them was gone. 

He continued a moment, trying to 
tempt the dus with a scrap of food, 
for until Melein had come, he had 
deceived himself that there was the 
slightest flicker of interest in the 
dark eyes of the animal. Now it 
would not even glance at him. But 
he had so deceived himself many a 
time since its coming to the edun. 
He shrugged and casually tossed the 
prize to the dus, letting it land be- 
tween its massively clawed 
forepaws. Sometime, eventually, it 
would eat. Now it accepted just 
enough to stay alive; sometimes he 
would see the scrap shriveled and 
neglected that evening, and the dus 
moved slightly elsewhere until it 
was taken away; for the dus was 
proud, and did not want to eat. 



Someone else saw that the wa- 
terbowl by the step was constantly 
full. This was great extravagance on 
Kesrith. Ordinarily a sick dus sim- 
ply complained when thirsty and re- 
ceived what it needed; and a healthy 
one derived all its moisture re- 
quirement from food it ate. Niun 
suspected kel Pasev of this wasteful 
charity. She had her own dus but 
she was capable of such feelings 
toward a good animal. He was not 
himself so deft in his offerings as 
was Pasev. Doubtless everyone in 
the edun knew how desperately he 
tried to feed the creature, and claim 
it, and how it stubbornly refused 
him. 

Likely another kel’en would be 
feeding it if he were not. The dus 
shamed them all in its loyal grief. It 
found not one of them worthy to 
take it; and rarely would a dus 
transfer affection, but Niun still 
hoped, desperately, for the life of 
this one. 

“Sometimes,” said Melein, “they 
simply cannot be saved.” 

She sat down on the dusty step 
with him, heedless of her robes of 
caste; but the granular sand of the 
edun grounds did not cling as much 
as the white lowlands powder. She 
wore the light veil over her silken 
mane in the out-of-doors, for the 
Sen disdained to cover. 

The body of a kel’en is itself a 
Mystery of the People, the teachings 
held, and therefore the Kel veils; 
the body of a sen’en is a veil to that 
within, which is a Mystery of the 
People, and therefore the Sen veils 
not. 

Save to the unacceptable. 

The weather was fair after the 
storm of days past in which wrack 



98 



GALAXY 




and disaster had blown down the 
passes and dealt havoc in the regul 
town. The smoke of the destruction 
in the lowlands had been visible 
even through the rain; and when the 
worst of the storm was done, the 
kel’ein had looked out from the 
summit of the Sen-tower with a new 
and bitter satisfaction. 

“Ah,” Eddan had said when they 
noted the smoke and the fire, “Kes- 
rith has her way with the masters 
even yet.” 

It was likely that many regul had 
perished in the conflagration. Such 
satisfaction was a thing that once no 
mri would have thought or felt. But 
that was before the unaccounted-for 
death of kel’en on a regul ship, 
and before it was clear that humans 
would possess the world. 

Now the stars of evening began 
to show in a clear sky, and there 
was no wind to stir the sand and 
make the mez advisable. Such crys- 
tal evenings were frequent following 
the greatest storms, as if the very 
world lay exhausted after the recent 
violence. 

He dropped his veil and looped it 
under his chin, refastening it. There 
was no likelihood of tsi’mri here, 
and he did not need it. 

“Shall we walk?” Melein 

suggested. 

He had no such thing in mind, 
but rarely did Melein ask anything 
of him any longer. He arose and 
offered her his hand to help her up. 
Thereafter they walked, side by 

side, in the direction Melein chose, 
taking the small trail that led from 
the corner of the edun to the rocks 
at the top of the causeway. He 
found himself remembering the 

times that they had run that dis- 



tance, they three, agile as the dusty 
lizards, children without the veil, 
small slim-limbed boys and smaller 
girl, racing illicitly for the vantage 
point from which they could see the 
ships at the port come and go. 

They had been ships with magical 
names then, mri ships, regul 
ships — Mlereinei, Kamrive, Horagh- 
no — that came from distant stars and 
the glory of battles. As children 
they had played at war and duel 
and imagined themselves great 
kel’ein, glittering with honors like 
the far-traveled kel’ein that visited 
from the ships and departed their 
own ways again, like their 
truemother and their father that left 
separately with the ships and never 
visited homeworld again. 

Tonight they walked, he of the 
Kel, she of the Sen, weighted with 
their robes of caste and their sepa- 
rate laws. When they reached the 
rock that overlooked the valley, he 
leaped up first and pulled her be- 
hind him with a single tug — there 
was still the girl Melein within the 
golden robes, agile and quick as a 
kel’e’en, unbecoming the gravity of 
her caste. 

They sat together while the red 
sun vanished,' watching the whole 
of the valley, and the glow of lights 
where the port was, and the wound 
the storm had made there, a dark- 
ness amid the lights near Hazan. 

“Why did you ask me here?” he 
asked of her at last. 

“To talk with you.” 

He did not like this manner in 
her. The last light touched her face. 
It was that of a stranger for a mo- 
ment, someone he should re- 
member, and did not, quite. It was 
not Melein as he knew her, but a 



THE FADED SUN 



99 




sen’e’en, that contained quiet, se- 
cret thoughts. He suddenly wished 
she would not pursue the opening 
he had given her. He foreknew that 
she might rob him of his peace; and 
he could not stop her from doing it. 

“You do not smile anymore,” 
she said. “You do not even look up 
when you are named.” 

“I am not a child.” 

“You do not love the she’pan.” 

“I came. I sit. I wait. This seems 
to be all she wants of me. It is her 
right.” 

“You do not much go out of the 
edun.” 

“I have given up, Melein. That 
is all.” 

She gazed upward, where the 
stars glittered. Her arm, resting on 
her raised knee, pointed toward 
Elag’s star that shone and danced 
above the hills. “There are humans 
now,” she said. “But it is different 
there — at Kesrith. This is home- 
world. Sanctuary for the People. 
The Holy.” 

He looked at her, sullen, 
frightened. “Remember that I am 
kel’en.” 

“The Kel must remain unlearned 
because the Kel ventures where our 
enemies are, where knowledge that 
cannot serve the Kel cannot be 
permitted. For all traditions, how- 
ever minor, there are reasons. You 
are a kel’en of home world, and you 
will hear what it would not be good 
for a kel’en elsewhere to hear.” 

He rose and set his back against 
the rock, leaning there with his 
arms folded and the rising breeze 
touching him with more chill than 
was comfortable. It was night now, 
the last of the sun slipped from 
view. He did not know why she had 

100 



wished to come out here. The hills 
were full of menace. 

The ha-dusei, wild relatives of 
the tame companions of the kel’ein, 
were not to be trusted. There were 
windflowers and burrowers, and 
serpents that hid in the rocks. He 
owned a sen’e’en his protection; it 
was arrant stupidity to be out here 
with Melein in his charge after 
dark. Her value to the edun was in- 
calculably above his. 

“We can talk elsewhere later,” 
he said. “I do not think we should 
have come here at this hour.” 

“Listen to me!” 

Her voice was edged, cruel, a blow 
that stunned. Melein was his little 
sister. She had never before used 
that tone with him. 

“Today,” she said, “the she’pan 
called me in private. Today she 
gave me rank with Sathell. And you 
understand this.” 

She’pan’s successor, her Chosen. 

In the nethermost parts of his 
mind he had known it would come; 
this was the only reasonable pur- 
pose behind Intel’s snatching Me- 
lein out of Kel and into Sen. 

Not to bear children, but to learn 
the Pana. the Mysteries; not to con- 
tinue the People, but to rule them. 

And Intel had taken him likewise, 
to defend challenge to herself, to 
guard her — to kill, if need be, any 
over-anxious successor and any 
kel’en that supported a challenger’s 
cause. 

He gave a single bitter curse, un- 
derstanding; and he saw the hurt 
leap into Melein’s eyes. 

“I am sorry that you take it so,” 
she said. 

“Why must she have kept me by 
her and not Medai?” 



GALAXY 




“She trusted you, and never 
Medai.” 

He considered that, and its 
reasons. “She trusted you,” he said 
softly, “while I guard her sleep. 
While she could set me against 
you.” 

The hurt to Melein became 
shock. The thought seemed to star- 
tle her. “No,” she said. “I am not 
apt to challenge her.” 

"'Not as long as you have regard 
for me,” he answered. “She feels 
her mortality on her or she would 
not have named you yet. And some 
kel’en will guard her tomb.” 

“She would not take you. 
Eddan . Sirain . they would 
seek the honor. But not you.” 
“Maybe with the humans at hand 
the question is pointless. I am think- 
ing ahead of the hour, and that is 
beyond my caste. You will have to 
think that through, truesister. I am 
far from knowing the future. I can 
only speak for what is true now.” 
“She is not preparing to cede 
homeworld quietly. Niun ... I am 
young, I am nothing compared to 
Intel’s experience. Other she’panei 
would hesitate to challenge her; she 
knows too much. Killing her would 
rob the People of so much, you do 
not know how much. It would be 
an act of — I do not know, Niun, I 
do not know. If I should succeed 
her as she’pan of homeworld, here 
am I — young, inexperienced. I 
know that some older she’pan will 
come then and challenge, and it will 
be my place to die. I want her to 
live, I desperately want her to live, 
and she is dying, Niun.” 

He found himself trembling, hurt- 
ing to reassure her; and there was 
no comfort to be found. She spoke 



of things beyond his caste; and yet 
he thought that she had laid out all 
the truth for him, and stolen what 
remained of his peace and hope. He 
had always thought that she would 
survive him. 

“We were unlucky,” she said, 
“in being last-bom of the People; 
not alone of Kesrith, Niun, but of 
all the People. We were without 
choice simply because we were the 
last. I wish it were different.” 

What she said struck at other 
confidences. He looked at her with 
the wind whipping at them and chill- 
ing to the skin, and ceased even to 
shiver. “Of all the People?” 

“Edunei have fallen,” she said, 
“and children have died; and 
kel’e’ein are occupied with war and 
nothing else. I should not have an- 
swered,” she added. “But of our 
generation, there is little left. Those 
older, they will get other children. 
It is not too late.” 

She tried to comfort him. He 
reassured himself that she had faith 
in their future, and that this was 
enough. 

“But then,” he said, catching up 
a thought, -“then Intel will not 
plan to lose you. You might be, after 
after all, the ablest after her; and if 
she bequeaths my service to you — if 
you should challenge or return 
challenge — Melein, I can defend 
you. I am not unable to defend you. 

I am skilled in the yin’ein. Nine 
years they have kept me in training. 
I must be capable of something.” 
She was silent for a time. Finally 
she arose. “Come,” she said. “Let 
us return to the edun. I am cold.” 
And she was silent as they 
climbed down to the trail and 
walked back; she wept. He saw it in 



THE FADED SUN

the starlight and took off his veil 
and offered it to her, a gesture of 
profound tenderness. 

“No,” she said fiercely. He nod- 
ded and flung the met over his 
shoulder, walking beside her. “You 
are right,” she said finally. “I will 
not surrender the office and die 
without challenge . should it 
come to me. I will kill to hold it.” 

“It is a great honor for you,” he 
said, thinking that he should have 
said something of the kind when 
she first told him. 

She let go her breath, a slow 
hiss. “What, honor? To go into 
some strange edun, and into a 
strange Kel, and kill some woman 
who never did me hurt? I do not want 
that honor. ’ ’ 

“But Intel will arm you for 
this,” he said. “She will make you 
able. She has surely planned for this 
for many years.” 

She looked up at him, her 
shadowed face set and calm now. 
“I think you are not far wrong,” 
she said, “in believing that she 
wanted you by her because she 
knows I could make trouble in the 
House. She trusts you. She does not 
trust me.” 

He shivered, hearing in her voice 
the bitterness he had always sus- 
pected was there, and shadows tore 
away between himself and the Sen- 
tower and the she ’pan. 

He remembered Melein preparing 
the cup each evening, the cup that 
helped the she’pan sleep; and each 
evening the she’pan drinking, 
nothing questioning. He suspected 
what ungentle things might run in 
Intel’s drughazed mind: a she'pan 
foreseeing her own death and mis- 
trusting her successor with good 

102 



reason. 

Intel had wated Melein dis- 
armed. For this she had sent Medai 
into service, and had kept her 
brother close by. Some kel’en 
would guard Intel’s tomb. Normally 
it would be one of her Husbands, 
not a son. But there might be one 
instruction if she passed of age, 
another if by Melein’s hand. 

And Melein would have to chal- 
lenge against him to challenge Intel. 
He would die before Intel would; 
but then Melein would have to find 
a kel’en to champion her — and there 
was none who would agree to that. 

Intel had done well to banish 
Medai. 

But Melein was not capable of 
the things of which Intel suspected 
her; he insisted to believe that she 
was not. Caste and teaching and the 
bitterness of her imprisonment could 
not have changed his truesister to 
that extent. He would not believe 
that Intel’s fears were justified. 

I want her to live, / desperately 
want her to live, I desperately want 
her to live, Melein had said. 

“How much,” he asked finally, 
“did she bid you tell me?” 

“Less,” she said, “than I have 
told you.” 

“Yes,” he said, “I had thought 
so.” 

They came back to the edun, she 
drawing ahead of him as they en- 
tered. He looked aside at the dus, 
that turned its head from him. 
When he looked up, she had gone 
on into the shadows, toward the 
stairs of her own tower. 

She did not look back. 

He went toward the she ’pan’s 
tower, to take up his duty, where he 
belonged.

XI 

There was quiet over Kesri th. 
After so many hazards, after two 
days stalled with the port in chaos 
from the storm, the last shuttle had 
lifted — with its cargo of refugees — 
to the station where the freighter 
Res-trivi was forming the last regu- 
lar civilian list that would leave the 
world. Hereafter there was time, 
necessary time, for setting final 
matters in order. Against the ruddy 
sun of Kesrith there was only 
Hazan remaining — armed and, 
when her minor repairs were com- 
pleted, star-capable; she waited with 
her crew constantly within her. She 
carried in her tapes the way to 
Nurag, to regul homeworld, to 
safety and civilization for the few 
hundred regul left on Kesrith. 

A ten of times each passing day 
bai Hulagh Alagn-ni, working in his 
heated offices in the Nom complex, 
looked up at the windows and con- 
cerned himself with the condition of 
Hazan. The dual-capable ship, 
strong enough behind her screens 
for combat, was yet a perilously 
fragile structure when grounded. He 
had hesitated to take her down in 
the first place; he had suffered 
agonies of mind in the hours of the 
storm’s approach, and had at last 
decided against lofting her to 
stationside. 

And then — then to have a witless 
aircraft pilot attempt to outrun the 
storm and risk the crosswinds, a 
known peril at Kesrith’s field — on 
such an occurrence the whole mis- 
sion was almost lost. Hulagh cursed 
each time he thought of it, the 
youngling pilot and passengers, of 
course, beyond retribution. He was 



relieved that, at the least, damage 
had been confined to the tower and 
loading facilities, and harm to Ha- 
zan’ s structure was minimal. Luck 
had been with him. Hazan was in 
his trust over the objections of pow- 
erful influences back on home- 
world. He had risked everything 
in securing for himself and his inter- 
ests this post, replacing old Gruran 
and Solgah Holn-ni — an assign- 
ment for which his personal age and 
erudition had qualified him — and 
thereby winning doc Alagn the status 
it was long overdue. 

But as with landing the ship, as 
with other decisions he had made 
along the way, it was necessary to 
risk in order to gain. It was neces- 
sary to demonstrate to homeworld 
his claimed ability and that of doch 
Alagn in order to obtain the influ- 
ence permanently. 

He could do so by salvaging the 
most possible benefit of Kesrith, 
after its loss by Gruran Holn-ni and 
his get; and Solgah Holn-ni — he 
thought with disgust and contempt 
of the prolific female who had ruled 
Holn’s establishment of Kesrith and 
lorded it so thoroughly over the 
zone and over the war that was her 
creation — Solgah was on her way 
to homeworld in utter confusion, 
stripped of her command, most of 
her younglings left behind, their 
ranks decimated by Hulagh’s own 
orders, survivors parceled out to 
many different colonies, the doch in 
complete . disorganization. She 
would be lu'cky if her influences on 
homeworld enabled her to escape 
sifting and the execution of her 
younglings. At the least, Holn was 
due for some years of obscurity. 

The memory still pleased him — 



THE FADED SUN 



103 




the way Solgah had received the 
shock of Hazan’s unscheduled and 
unauthorized landing; the way she 
had fluttered and blustered with 
prohibitions and objections, until he 
had made known to her his 
homeworld-granted authority to as- 
sume control. 

Now it was his office to complete 
the evacuation Solgah had begun, to 
save as much as possible from the 
concessions her weak kinsman, 
Gruran Holn-ni, had granted in 
negotiations at Elag, trying to save 
the inner portions of the vast Holn 
empire. It was his task to prepare 
Kesrith to receive human occupation 
and to remove regul properties, as 
much as could be saved, and regul 
personnel, as many as could be 
saved; and to ensure that humans 
drew the least possible benefit from 
what they had won in war and in 
negotiations. 

Hulagh had dealt with humans 
indirectly for three homeworld 
years, having met with a few after 
replacing Gruran; and he knew 
them — including the two that had 
come in on Hazan — with a quiet but 
mild distaste; less distaste, in fact, 
than he had ever felt for mri, who 
served regul. The human war, of 
course, had been a complete mis- 
take, an error in calculations, not 
one attributable to doch Alagn. It 
had been abundantly clear to wiser 
regul minds for the better part of 
five years that the companies of 
Holn doch had involved themselves 
in an utter fiasco from which the 
mri were unable to rescue them, 
and that error would have been 
corrected then had it been possible 
to restrain the obstinacies and mili- 
tary power of such as Holn, whose 

104 



employ of mercenary kel’ein, and 
whose obvious self-interest in re- 
taining the disputed territories, had 
stalled off any change in policy. 

Now, at last, after the consequen- 
ces of the original error were 
multiplied to great cost, after regul 
lives and properties and home terri- 
tory itself had been lost, the Holn 
empire tottering on the brink, now 
the military Holn handed the tangled 
and dangerous situation — reluctantly 
even so — over to older, wiser minds 
on Nurag. 

And politics, in a turn of events 
unforeseen by the Holn, had served 
to turn the Holn authority finally 
into the hands of Alagn and to ele- 
vate Alagn to a status in which 
Alagn, with the right Alagn in 
command, could utterly ruin doch 
Holn. 

Holn had left a tangle behind 
them. Bai Hulagh was far from 
satisifed with the treaty terms within 
which he must operate but they 
were Holn’s legacy, sealed, legal, 
recorded and beyond his power to 
adjust. Yet if the cession of three 
colonial systems, costly as that was, 
had created a permanent and reli- 
able boundary between human and 
regul claims, it could turn out to be 
one of the wiser things doch Holn 
had done in its administration. 
Doubtless, Hulagh felt, the humans 
now clearly knew that they had 
made all the cheap gain they could 
reasonably expect in this adventure 
and that hereafter regul would resist 
with more vigor. The humans were 
apparently perplexed and disturbed 
by this sudden change of authority 
on the frontier and yet they seemed 
anxious to honor the treaty. Kesrith 
was a likely and sensible boundary. 

GALAXY 




The dead space of the Deep dis- 
couraged exploration regulward 
without considerable routing round 
by Hesoghan, an old and firmly 
regul holding; and the lure of the 
Haze-stars would lead humans from 
Kesrith rimward in due time. 

So Hulagh planned in his 
strategies, mapping what he consid- 
ered might be new directions in 
regul policy. The humans would be 
attracted by the wealth toward 
which Kesrith had been reaching; 
but, likewise, the regul stars had 
mineral wealth sufficient to sustain 
industries without the convenient 
luxury of doch Holn’s outermost 
colonies. Economic effects would 
be felt, but only in small degree on 
homeword; and as long as the elders 
of homeworld were well supplied in 
their needs, the Alagn operation 
would be favorably judged. 

And afterward, it was only one 
arm of regul expansion that had 
been cut off. Two others remained. 
One of them was the presently 
meager holding of doch Alagn. 

To direct, to shape, to rule, to 
settle himself eternally into the 
memory not alone of doc Alagn but 
of the center of Nurag — this was the 
dream Hulagh savored. In his vast 
age he had outlived his rivals, had 
seen them dust; and he remem- 
bered, and planned long. He had 
obliterated the younglings of his 
chief enemies. He risked everything 
now in assuming personal command 
of Kesrith. If matters went amiss, it 
would be remembered that Hulagh 
of Alagn was in charge when they 
did so; but here on Kesrith also lay 
wealth he desperately needed. 

The terms of the human-regul 
treaty surrendered only the bare 



earth of the ceded worlds. They laid 
no specified claim to valuable 
hardware, cities, resources. Bare 
earth was all the encroaching hu- 
mans need find when they arrived; 
and redeveloping the stubborn wil- 
derness of Kesrith would occupy 
them long enough to give regulkind 
a breathing-space — while the plun- 
der of Kesrith would go into the 
stores of Alagn doch, legitimate 
salvage to which Holn had no 
claim. 

And all this under the very eyes 
of the human envoys. 

This satisfied Hulagh no less, to 
discredit the human who had been 
sent to oversee the transition of 
power. The sudden illness of the 
human elder and the natural timidity 
of its single youngling were a con- 
venience beyond measure. A regul 
elder would have demanded con- 
stant and detailed reports of actions 
by his hosts; a competent one would 
have demanded them in such vol- 
ume and at such a pace that nothing 
escaped his notice; a resourceful 
one would have used his young- 
ling’s eyes to see what he was not 
meant to see. But none of this had 
the human envoy managed on any 
great scale. The human concentrated 
on the wrong materials, learned the 
language assiduously and reheard 
reports that he had already been 
given in his own language, going 
over old information as if he sus- 
pected he could leam something 
new from it, as if there were dis- 
crepancies or untruths in plain 
statements. Such deception might be 
the human practice; they were not 
regul. What was happening was as 
wide as the port and as plain as the 
ships that daily lifted; and when 



106 



GALAXY 




humans arrived some few days 
hence, they would find a stripped 
and ruined possession and their del- 
egate in command of a barren wil- 
derness incapable of sustaining life 
on any large scale. 

This was itself a coup that the 
council on Nurag would savor when 
it heard of it. 

Hulagh had been perplexed origi- 
nally that the two humans had con- 
trived no means of circumventing 
the onerous restrictions placed on 
them. Only once had they broken 
quarantine, a quarantine no regul 
would have accepted in principle in 
the first place; and that one success 
seemed without forethought and was 
embarrassedly, tacitly, ignored by 
the envoy. It had succeeded only 
because it had been uncharacteristic 
of the humans, a minor victory in 
the sense of its unhappy result, but 
actually of no possible benefit to 
them. In the end only the kel’en 
had suffered for it, and that need- 
lessly, he being as impractical as all 
his kind. The mri had been a man 
of importance among their bloody, 
stubborn species. He had promised 
perhaps to be valuable; but he had 
been ruined. The humans remained 
ignorant even of this small revenge 
they had inflicted on their old 
enemies. They sat helpless, obe- 
dient. 

And hereafter there remained noth- 
ing much on Kesrith but what 
waited loading, now that work 
crews were free to clear the debris 
at the docks. There were charges to 
be set, a few small installations to 
be stripped, mines to be closed; but 
the most valuable cargo waited at 
the dock already. 

Of personnel there remained only 



the lowest-priority evacuees, who 
would leave with him on Hazan. 

Records bequeathed him from 
doch Holn indicated that there had 
been some eighteen million regul 
adults on Kesrith at the beginning 
of the evacuation procedure. It was 
a colony once exceedingly prosper- 
ous and supporting a university and 
a few first-rate elder minds (exclud- 
ing the Holn, whom he despised as 
over-valued). He knew the exact 
number — and the disposition Holn 
had made and the disposition he 
himself had made — of the remaining 
citizens and properties from the in- 
stant he had taken charge, and what 
goods to be consumed enroute he 
had placed on the evacuation ships 
and what was to be allotted as per- 
sonal baggage, and what he was 
salvaging to take himself; all this 
he knew down to fractional weight 
and space requirements for ship- 
ping. He had absorbed the data in 
minute detail. 

He had made occasional written 
records against the event of his sud- 
den death and the passing of Alagn 
doch to his immediate heirs — he did 
not entirely trust humans — or his 
sudden incapacity; but these were 
only for such an event. In the ordi- 
nary course of transactions he did 
not consult written records at all. It 
was physically impossible for a sane 
and healthy regul to forget anything 
he determined to remember, and it 
was also quite likely that he would 
remember whatever he heard only 
casually. Hulagh believed implicitly 
in the accuracy of the record he had 
obtained from Solgah Holn-ni, his 
enemy, as he believed implicitly in 
her sanity. It was inconceivable that 
Solgah — however lacking in astute- 



THE FADED SUN 



107 




ness she was, and over-impressed 
with her ability as an admin- 
istrator — would not have at least 
recalled accurately what was the 
number of regul on her world, 
and what their resources, and how 
disposed. 

He knew therefore that three 
hundred twenty-seven regul young 
remained with him outside the ship, 
the barest minimum necessary to 
carry out the dismantling operation, 
and three of those were almost 
adult. The majority were younglings 
below the age of twenty-five, as yet 
undetermined in sex — this would 
manifest itself at about thirty — and 
far more mobile than would be pos- 
sible for them as they began to at- 
tain their adult weight. They were 
of use to him when it came to er- 
rands or heavy labor, and for the 
observations of the evacuation that 
later would be gleaned from their 
memories by expert scholars on 
Nurag. Their memories, pre- 
sently — save in their most recent 
unique experiences and knowledge 
of the events passing around 
them — had not yet acquired suffi- 
cient data to make them intrinsically 
valuable to any elder, simply be- 
cause they had not lived long 
enough or traveled far enough to yet 
rival the experience or comparative 
observational powers of an elder. 
They belonged only to the doch of 
their birth and had not seen what 
they might yet accomplish; and 
since they would not sex and repro- 
duce for another several years, they 
were not distracted by these consid- 
erations. 

Only those fully mature and those 
protected by adult choice of a doch 
(even Holn) had been lifted off to 



safety in the main evacuation — they 
and such infants as could be con- 
tained in their mothers’ pouches for 
the duration of the voyages, life- 
supported without undue expendi- 
ture of resources by the crowded 
rescue ships. 

These last younglings, more for- 
tunate than the masses of Holn that 
had not fitted into either category, 
knew that they were still expenda- 
ble, and why, and they were ac- 
cordingly nervous about the coming 
of humans and petulant about their 
personal losses and — the common 
quality of the young — abysmally 
stupid in their anxieties, believing, 
for so their limited experience mis- 
led them, that they were the first 
and most important younglings in 
the history of the race to suffer such 
things. 

One fretted outside now and 
craved admittance for the fifth time, 
urgent with some message doubtless 
protesting the conditions under 
which they were confined in the 
Nom and forbidden to wander the 
square during off-hours, or protest- 
ing the long hours that they had 
been required to work since the 
crisis at the port, or expressing their 
increasing fear of the coming hu- 
mans and the fact that they them- 
selves were not yet on board the 
safety of Hazan, which was at the 
root of everything. Hulagh had an- 
swered enough such requests for at- 
tention, both from regul younglings 
and from dull-witted humans. He 
was busy. The youngling in ques- 
tion was not assigned anywhere 
near the human delegate, so it could 
not be an emergency in that quarter, 
which was the only matter that 
would have truly interested him 



108 



GALAXY 




within the Nom. He dealt with the 
destructions of the storm as best he 
could, covering the one error he had 
committed — failing to ask of Solgah 
concerning the behaviors of the sea- 
sons and the climate of Kesrith. He 
had little time for petulant and 
frightened assistants. 

But the youngling persisted, 
lhilagh sighed at last and pressed a 
button and admitted the youngling, 
whose agitation was extreme. 

“Be gracious, bai.” It was the 
one named Suth Hara-ri, bred of the 
university bai-dach. It gave a polite 
suck of breath. 

Hulagh reciprocated. There was 
at least some grace in Suth, who 
had been unmannered and fearful to 
a degree unbecoming any age when 
it began service. This former 
gracelessness on the part of Kes- 
rith’s younglings in general was 
surely due to the years of war that 
had encompassed the younglings’ 
entire experience. The Kesrithi 
younglings left in Hulagh ’s charge 
were now acquiring some graces. 
Hulagh continually took care to rep- 
rimand them so that they would not 
arrive ashamed and misfit in the 
inner worlds. This also he took for 
part of his duty in salvaging what 
he could of Kesrith; and he also an- 
ticipated winning the best of the 
younglings to Alagn’s enlistment as 
adults, hand-trained, augmenting his 
private staff to that of a colonial 
governor. 

He reached a place where stop- 
ping work would not overmuch in- 
convenience him, but he let the 
youngling wait a bit more while he 
enjoyed a cup of soi, and midway 
through it he saw fit to gesture his 
willingness to listen. 



“Be gracious,” Suth breathed, 
then blurted in desperate haste: 
“Bai, the station reports a mri ves- 
sel incoming.” 

This struck through all courtesies 
and lack of them, commanding 
Hulagh’s attention. Hulagh leaned 
back, the cup forgotten on the con- 
sole, and looked at the youngling in 
unconcealed dismay. 

The merceneray Kel — arriving in 
this situation with humans but a few 
days removed from Kesrith. 
Hulagh’s hearts became at once agi- 
tated and anger heated his face. It 
was like the mri, to be inconven- 
ient. 

To arrive always in the moment 
other elements had reached their 
maximum vulnerability. 

“They have given notice of their 
intentions?” Hulagh asked of Suth. 

“They say that they will land. 
We urged them to make use of the 
station facilities. They did not re- 
spond to this. They said that they 
have come for their people onworld 
and that they intend to land.” 

“Mri never lie,” said Hulagh for 
the youngling’s reference, assuming 
it had never dealt face to face with 
the mercenaries. “Neither do they 
always tell the truth. In that, they 
resemble regul.” 

Suth blinked and sucked air. Sub- 
tleties were wasted on this one. 
Hulagh frowned and blew heated air 
through his nostrils. 

“Are they to have their permis- 
sion to land?” asked Suth. “Bai, 
what shall we say?” 

“Tell me this, youngling: Where 
are our station ships?” 

“Why, gone, gracious lord, all 
but the freighter and the shuttles, 
with the evacuation.” 



THE FADED SUN 



109 




“Then we cannot very well en- 
force an instruction not to land, can 
we? You are dismissed, young- 
ling.” 

“Favor,” Suth murmured and 
withdrew, hasty and graceless in 
departure. Hulagh, already deep in 
thought, failed to rise to the provo- 
cation. 

Mri. 

Inconvenient as the stubborn 
kel’en he had inherited from Gru- 
ran. Bloody-handed and impulsive 
and incapable of coherent argument. 

His memory informed him that 
there were constantly some few mri 
on Kesri th, and that this was true of 
no other world since Nisren had fall- 
en to humans forty-three years ago. 
There were thirteen mri in resi- 
dence. There was nothing to indi- 
cate why Kesrith had been so fa- 
vored, save that mri had a tendency 
to choose one or another world as a 
permanent base, designating it as 
homeworld, and thereafter behaving 
as irrationally and emotionally as if 
this were indeed the true land of 
their birth. There had been three 
such homeworlds thus far in the 
regul-mri association, all within the 
Holn domain, since the mri had 
constantly come within Holn juris- 
diction and remained unknown in 
home territories of the regul. This 
employment of the mercenaries 
was, curiously, not an arrangement 
of regul seeking, but an arrange- 
ment that the mri had offered the 
regul two thousand two hundred 
two years ago — for no apparent rea- 
son, for no apparent compulsion, 
save that this arrangement seemed 
to satisfy some profound emotional 
need of the mri. Regul had inquired 
into this mri peculiarity, but re- 



mained unsatisfied. There was a 
regul joke about mri, that mri had 
made records about their home and 
origin but had forgotten where they 
had left them, hence their nomadic 
condition. The fact that mri had no 
memories was a laughable matter to 
one who had not dealt personally 
with the intractable mri. 

One could not argue with them, 
could not reason, could not per- 
suade them from old loyalties and 
could not — above all, could not — 
tamper with their sense of pro- 
prieties. He remembered Medai ’s 
suicide with a shudder: the kel’en 
stubborn and without memory and 
prone to violence. It was like the 
mri to prefer bloodshed to reason, 
even when it was one’s own blood 
that was shed. Medai, Kesrith-born, 
would not compromise; the mri trea- 
ty held only so long as regul main- 
tained a homeworld for mri, only so 
long as that homeworld was invio- 
late from invasion. Medai had seen 
what he had seen, and could not rea- 
son otherwise; and therefore he had 
chosen to set himself against his 
lawful employers. 

His suicide was supposed, 
Hulagh recalled, to put some burden 
of shame or social stigma on the 
man who had offended against the 
mri in question. This self- 
destruction was either an act of re- 
proach or of complete repudiation, 
meant to have, devastating effect on 
the emotions of his superior. 

A mri kel’en would do such a 
thing even knowing that regul were 
not impressed, casting away his 
precious life rather than compromise 
on a small point of duty that could 
make no ultimate difference to him 
personally. Mri doubtless imagined 



110 



GALAXY 




that it made a vast difference. 

It was that mri ferocity that had 
originally appealed to the regul, an 
amazement that this savage, fear- 
some species had come peacefully 
to the regul docha and tendered 
their services— services without 

which the colonizing of the hu- 
manward worlds and the rise of the 
Holn might never have occurred, at 
least not in the manner in which 
Holn had created monopoly. And 
(his very ferocity ought by rights to 
have warned sensible regul of the 
nature of mri. Mercenaries by 
breeding and choice, their strict, 
dull-witted codes made them in the 
beginning utterly dependable as 
guards in commerce of the outworld 
docha. They did not change al- 
legiance in mid-service; it was im- 
possible to bribe them; it was im- 
possible even to discharge them 
save by the completion of a service 
or by suicide. They had not sense 
enough to retreat; they had no 
strong instincts of self-preservation, 
a fact which balanced their prolific 
breeding, in which all males of the 
Kel were free to mate with the 
low-caste females as well as the 
mates of their own caste. They 
therefore tended in the years of 
peace to multiply at an alarming 
rate, were it not for the attrition 
worked on them by their way of 
life, their rejection of medical sci- 
ence, and their constant passion for 
dueling. 

How these fierce warriors had 
supported themselves before they 
found the regul to hire them was 
another mystery to regul, one which 
the mri had never chosen to reveal. 
Mri would not do manual labor, not 
even sufficient to provide them- 



selves food. A mri would starve 
rather than bear burdens or work the 
earth for another. They broke this 
rule only for the building and 
maintenance of their own towers 
and the managing of the few ships 
they were allotted personally; but 
beyond those two exceptions they 
would not turn a hand if there were 
regul available to take over the men- 
ial tasks. 

Once in Hulagh’s recall a certain 
ship with a kel’en aboard had met a 
difficulty other than human, a navi- 
gational malfunction that had the 
crew in a panic; they had sum- 
moned the ship’s kel’en — an old 
kel’e’en, it was — who had leisurely 
come to see the difficulty, sat down 
at the console and made the appro- 
priate adjustments; then, with con- 
summate arrogance, the kel’e’en 
had retired to the solitude of her 
own quarters, neither speaking nor 
offering courtesies nor accepting 
thanks. 

Yet this kel’ e’en could not read a 
simple sign to direct herself to the 
mess hall on station liberty, but had 
to be directed by her regul em- 
ployers. 

There was nothing to match 
either the arrogance or the ignor- 
ance of the mri Kel: touchy, suicid- 
ing when offended by regul, fight- 
ing when offended by other mri. 
There was no knowing what truly 
motivated the species. Hulagh him- 
self reckoned that he knew humans 
better than .he knew mri, although 
he had dealt with humans for three 
years and his ancestors had dealt 
with mri for two thousand two 
hundred two years. Humans were 
simply territorial like regul, and 
while they were creatures of brief 



THE FADED SUN 



111 




memory and small brain like the 
mri, they did have the industry to 
work and to mend the deficiencies 
of their talents with an admirable 
technology. 

It was a curious thing that in the 
forty-three-year war the regul had 
come to trust humans far more than 
they did mri; they had come to fear 
humans far less than they feared 
mri. Constantly regul had to com- 
mand the mri to observe the decen- 
cies of restraint, actually had to 
intervene to prevent the mri from 
escalating the war out of the territo- 
rial zone of conflict and into 
reaches far beyond regul limits, into 
a scale in which regul technology 
was inadequate to maintain defenses 
around vital home worlds. The mri, 
who were specialists in war, yet had 
not been able to perceive this; even 
the Holn had done so, and had put 
restraints to the war or there would 
have been incredible devastation 
and economic collapse. Mri might 
lose one homeworld after another 
and move on, but they were 
nomadic; perhaps that, Hulagh es- 
timated, was the source of their 
contempt for national boundaries. 
Regul could not contemplate the 
loss of even one world of home 
space, with artwork, technology, 
trade routes; they did not intend at 
any time to enter war with the all- 
out dedication of mri. 

The most serious losses were, at 
the end of matters, to the mri them- 
selves. Mri had begun the war with 
one million, nine hundred fifty and 
seven kel’ein according to regul 
census; and this small figure was 
still a great increase over their 
former numbers, reflecting the 
prosperity that had been theirs while 

112 



in regul service over the span of 
two thousand two hundred two 
years. Only a hundred thousand had 
they numbered when their leaders 
had first approached the regul and 
begged to be allowed to take service 
with the regul species. But now the 
most recent records indicated that 
there were but five hundred thirty- 
three mri of all castes surviving in 
known space. 

It was impossible, considering 
that small number and the mri’s un- 
restrainably fierce inclinations, that 
the species could survive at this low 
ebb — ironically — without regul pro- 
tection during their recovery. An 
era had ended with the passing of 
the basis of Holn power, with the 
passing of the kel’ein. A few could 
be preserved by Alagn if the mri 
would, in extremity, permit them- 
selves to see reason; and Hulagh 
could see use for them, if only in 
the regul awe of the ferocity of the 
Kel. But they must be removed 
from the path of the human advance 
or the mri would continue, like au- 
tomatons, to dash themselves to 
death against the inevitable. 

And in the midst of other confu- 
sions, one mri must suicide and 
now a mri ship must come interfer- 
ing in the evacuation of the mri 
homeworld. It would be an armed 
ship. Mri vessels, at least vessels 
totally mri, were small, but mri did 
not go anywhere unarmed. 

The humans who were coming to 
take possession of Kesrith would 
likewise be armed. 

Hulagh considered for one wild 
moment making a graceless with- 
drawal from his duty on Kesrith, 
bundling surviving younglings and 
himself aboard Hazan tonight and 

GALAXY 




leaving the mri and the humans to 
each others’ mercies. 

But Hazan was not ready, not 
fully repaired, her important cargo 
impossible to load until the dock 
machinery too had been repaired. 

And he would not retreat in such 
fashion, a move that would be told 
on homeworld to his discredit; in 
i hat much he understood the mri 
compulsion to stand fast when 
pushed. 

He reached to his left and pressed 
a button, contacting the youngling 
llada Surag-gi, kosaj of the Nom, 
Ihat served him personally for suffi- 
ciently important errands: a twenty- 
year-old, Hada, extraordinarily 
competent in its advanced post. 

“Hada,” he said, “send the rec- 
ords of mri settlement on Kes- 
rith.” 

“Be gracious,” replied Hada’s 
voice. “Such records go back two 
thousand two hundred two years. 
Kesrith was among the first worlds 
possessed by the mri and it is lo- 
cally believed that they were here 
before first contact. What information 
does the bai wish in particular? I 
may perhaps recall what is of 
help.” 

This was utter impudence, that 
such a youngling supposed its own 
personal knowledge sufficient to 
remedy the desire of an elder. 

“O young ignorance,” said 
Hulagh peevishly, remembering that 
he was the only elder presently on 
Kesrith and that the youngling, al- 
though impertinent and self- 
important, was probably offering, 
with the best of intentions, to save 
him valuable time and effort. This 
was not, after all, Nurag; there was 
a limit on everyone’s time and pa- 



tience, most particularly his own. 
“Hada . what do you suppose 
would bring a mri ship now to Kes- 
rith?” 

“This is,” said Hada, “the pres- 
ent mri homeworld. Perhaps they 
mean to defend it. They are not ac- 
customed to retreat.” 

It was not a comforting conjec- 
ture, and precisely the one Hulagh 
had made for himself. Yet the mri 
had accepted the treaty that regul 
had made with humans; mri had 
been advised at every step of the 
negotiations that they might not 
carry on further war with humans. 

“Hada, what is the present 
number of mri on Kesrith?” 

“Bai, there are thirteen, mostly 
elders of the edun and entirely unfit 
for war.” 

He was surprised by this. He had 
not been interested in the small 
edun since it had not intruded into 
his notice; he had known the 
number accurately, but not the in- 
capacity, of its members. 

“Send the records anyway, what- 
ever you possess on the leaders per- 
sonally and on the history of the 
species here.” Perdition, thought 
Hulagh miserably, mri have been on 
Kesrith for far too many years for 
me to sift through such as this. 
There is no time. The records will 
be mountainous . 

“Hada.” 

“Favor?” 

“Contact their kel’anth. Tell him 
I want him to report to this office 
immediately.” 

^ There was a long pause. “Be 
gracious, bai,” ventured Hada at 
last. “The Kesrithi edun is headed 
by a she’pan, one Intel. Onworld a 
kel’anth must defer to a she’pan. 



THE FADED SUN 



113 




He is not the leader of the mri on 
Kesri th.” 

Hulagh’s oath cut short the 
youngling. There was silence in the 
chatter for a moment, welcome si- 
lence. He absorbed the new infor- 
mation, embarrassed by his reliance 
on a youngling’s knowledge and 
aware that, where mri were con- 
cerned, no one actually knew what 
the chain of command was within 
their community. Hada claimed to 
possess this knowledge. Perhaps 
Hada had acquired it from elders of 
Holn doch, who had commanded 
mri for generations. 

Plague and perdition , thought 
Hulagh, there is no time, there is 
no time. Confound all mri to perdi- 
tion. But neither did one summon a 
she’pan; he knew that much. None 
but Kel-caste would respond to a 
summons to leave their community 
and meet with outsiders. There was 
the necessity to brave the process of 
records-search or the necessity to 
ignore the incoming ship, with all 
its ugly possibilities. 

Or — there was the necessity to 
leave his desk and his work and his 
important duties to the incompetent 
mercies of youngling assistants at 
such a crisis, while he paid slow 
courtesies to a mri religious leader, 
whose memory was fallible and 
whose graces were probably lack- 
ing, who trammeled up the cleanly 
relations between regul doch and 
mri kel’anth. He and the warleader 
of the Kel might have settled things 
with a simple exchange. But with 
one of the ceremonial leaders of the 
mri involved — one whose power 
was nebulous and whose authorities 
and compulsions were somehow 
linked to the mri religion, whatever 

114 



it was — a regul petitioner must suf- 
fer tedious and pointless discussion 
that might only perhaps produce 
what he wanted. 

“Hada,” said Hulagh, surrender- 
ing, “fetch me my car and the most 
reliable driver, a youngling who 
does not flinch from mri.” 

Many humiliations had he ac- 
cepted in dealing with the invading 
humans, in negotiations concerning 
arrangements, in accepting two in- 
convenient observers whose pres- 
ence, if known, could cause impos- 
sible complications with the mri trea- 
ty. He had succeeded in handling 
the humans, which was thought to 
have been the most difficult matter; 
he had outmaneuvered them in a 
way that would bring him prestige. 
And now it came to this, that he 
must interrupt the saving of regul 
lives and regul properties to counsel 
with mri hirelings, to rescue an un- 
grateful people who most likely 
would not treat with him courte- 
ously for his efforts. 

A thought struck him. “Hada,” 
he said. 

“Favor?” 

“Is it or is it not possible that the 
mri would know that one of their 
ships is coming?” 

“That information has not been 
released by this office,” said Hada. 
Then: “Be gracious, bai. Mri have 
learned things before this that have 
not been released by this office. 
They have their own communica- 
ions.” 

“Doubtless,” said Hulagh, and 
broke the connection and went 
about the laborious and painful 
business of rising. He was two 
hundred ninety years removed from 
the class of younglings. His legs 

GALAXY 




were proportionately shorter, his 
senses duller, his body many times 
heavier. His rugose skin was prone 
to cracking and developing sores 
when directly exposed to the dry 
cold of Kesrith’s air. His double 
hearts labored under the exertion of 
lilting his adult bulk, and his mus- 
cles trembled with the unaccus- 
tomed strain. As an elder of the re- 
I’til, his principal business was of 
the mind and the intellect. 

And he was reduced to this, to 
visit mri. 

XII 

The mri edun hove into view: a 
set of truncated, common-based 
cones, ominously alien and located, 
inevitably, in the most inconvenient 
and inaccessible place available. 
Hulagh settled uneasily into his 
cushions in the rear of the landsled 
and saw it grow nearer. Built of the 
soil of the mineral flats, cemented 
and dull-surfaced, it was of a color 
with the earth but startling to the 
eye and forbiddingly sterile in its 
outlines. It wasted space with its 
slanting walls — but then, mri never 
did anything the simple way. It 
was, he reflected, indicative of the 
mri mind, non-utilitarian, alien in 
its patterns, deliberately isolate. 

The sled labored in the climb up 
ihe causeway which the rains, that 
other of Kesrith’s terrestrial nui- 
sances, had left in ill-repair, dis- 
solving the salts that lay in thick de- 
posits hereabouts, and creating 
alarming channels in the earth and 
rock of the road. On either side lay 
a fatal plunge to the thin crusts of 
the flats, volcanic and constantly 
steaming at one or another vent. 



Hulagh tried not to think of the depths 
that lay beside the treads of the 
sled as it ground its way over a 
series of ruts that had almost eaten 
the road away. 

Mri did not choose to repair it. 
Old they might be, but even if they 
were physically capable, they would 
have disdained to do so, not as long 
as there remained onworld a single 
regul on whom to cast the responsi- 
bility. The road would wash away 
before mri would stir to mend it, 
and there was no intention in 
Hulagh ’s mind to better it for 
human benefit. 

He only hoped it would suffice to 
carry him to and from, and that 
once only. 

The car jolted up the last few feet 
of incline and came to the main 
entry of the edun. The structure it- 
self was in similar disrepair, already 
yielding to the rains that would 
claim it in the end, that would re- 
duce it to the white earth again. The 
slanted walls bore dim traces of 
colors that must once have made 
them bright. 

He had seen pictures of edunei 
but he had never seen one in reali- 
ty, let alone one in such a state. 
This was surely an ancient struc- 
ture, and sadly declined. Mri were 
usually more proud. Even the front 
walk was . guttered with erosion 
channels; and with the sled grinding 
to a halt, bai Hulagh looked on that 
irregular surface with dread. It was 
a long walk, a difficult walk, on 
soft ground. ■ 

And there was a dus guarding the 
entry, a massive brown lump — all 
wrinkles and folds of flesh rising to 
a hump at the shoulders and de- 
scending at either end. It seemed to 



THE FADED SUN 



115 




be asleep, resting with its back a 
quarter as high as the door, and 
higher by more should it stir, which 
Hulagh fervently hoped it would not 
do. Dusei were wherever mri 
traveled, but on ship they kept en- 
tirely to the kel’en’s cabin and were 
not allowed to range the premises. 
He had never encountered one at 
close range; he had let his young- 
lings tend to that unpleasantness. He 
knew only what he had heard: that 
while mri were legally class-two sa- 
pients on a scale that rated regul as 
one, dusei were tentatively classed 
at ten, although many who had 
dealt with the frustrating creatures 
reckoned that dusei should be con- 
siderably higher or lower. They 
were Kesrith’s native dominant 
species — he knew this too — and al- 
though they ran wild wherever mri 
had been for long, this was their 
origin. They were a plague in the 
wilds of whatever world they 
adopted, and they were dangerous. 
There were surely wild ones now 
prolific in the hills and plains — 
slow, patient omnivores, a gift such 
as regul gladly bestowed on the 
humans. 

Mri purchased with their service 
food to feed their dusei, which ac- 
cordingly haunted their dwellings 
and accompanied them into space; 
but dusei did nothing, contributed 
nothing, did not fight unless cor- 
nered, and were never eaten. Their 
only visible benefit was that to keep 
them nearby pleasured the mri, who 
apparently derived some social 
status among their own kind for the 
keeping and support of such useless 
and expensive creatures. Hulagh 
himself collected gems, stones, 
geological curiosities. He attempted 
116 



to comprehend the mentality of the 
mri, who treasured such live and 
dangerous specimens. 

This one in particular looked dis- 
eased. Its hide was patched and its 
attitude was more sluggish than was 
natural even for a dus. It had not 
so much as lifted its head as the land- 
sled drew up at the walk. 

The sight of the ugly creature did 
more than the decay of the edun it- 
self to distress Hulagh’s aesthetic 
sense. He looked at it, and did not 
wish to look, as he forced his con- 
siderable bulk from the confines of 
the sled and waited for his driver, 
one Chul Nag-gi, to assist him up 
the walk. Chul also seemed to re- 
gard the dus with distaste, and as 
they walked together toward the 
step, Chul dutifully walked on the 
side nearest the creature and kept a 
constant eye on it. The dus lifted its 
head to investigate them as they 
came to the doorway. Its eyes were 
running and unhealthy looking. 

Perdition, thought Hulagh uneas- 
ily, the thing is dying of disease on 
their doorsill, and will they not de- 
stroy it? — for the sake of hygiene, if 
not mercy. 

The dus investigated them, snuff- 
ling wetly, and emitted a strange 
sound, a low rumbling and whuf- 
fing that was not pleasure and not 
quite menace. “Away!” Chul 
exclaimed in a voice tinged with 
panic. Hulagh edged past with all 
possible speed while Chul fended 
the creature away with a violent 
kick. Chul overtook him just inside 
the dark door and offered an arm 
once more, whereupon they began 
the long walk together. 

A mri saw them and vanished, a 
black shadow among shadows, and 

GALAXY 




none offered to guide them. Hulagh 
needed no guidance. He had be- 
come acquainted before they left the 
Nom with the plan of edunei, which 
was universal, He knew the general 
design of the ground level and 
where the fourth cone of the 
she ’pan ought to sit, and to this 
cone he walked slowly, panting, 
struggling as the approach offered, 
to his horror, stairs, winding up and 
up toward the crest. 

A shout echoed from above. Yet 
he saw no one and came at his own 
agonized pace, step by step, past 
mud-plastered walls cheaply deco- 
rated with rough designs or sym- 
bols, so irregularly and stylistically 
painted that they seemed impossible 
of decipherment even if one knew 
the mri system. Designs in black 
and gold and blue serpentined 
around the windings of the corridor 

THE FADED SUN 



upon walls and ceilings. They might 
be religious in nature — this was 
another thing the mri had never 
revealed — intended to avert evils or 
call them down on intruders; or 
perhaps the mri simply thought 
them beautiful. It was difficult to 
reconcile this with the modern light- 
ing and the other evidences of mri 
sophistication with regul machinery, 
almost unbelievable that a people 
that could handle starflight yet lived 
in this primitive manner. 

The doors that shielded the hall 
where the she ’pan would hold 
state — most of the doors in the 
edun, in fact — were steel, of regul 
manufactury; and steel likely rein- 
forced the mud-and-binder architec- 
ture. ; 

“They do not mind furnishing 
their mud hovels with good regul 
metal,” Chul said, an undertone, 

117 



but the youngling saved its com- 
ments for itself when Hulagh gave 
it a hard look; the acuity of mri 
hearing was legendary. 

“Open the door,” said Hulagh. 

And when Chul had done so, the 
youngling gave a sharp intake of 
breath, for there was a mri directly 
confronting them, a black-veiled 
kel’en, a mere youngling himself: 
Hulagh reckoned so, at least, by the 
unmarred brow and clear golden 
skin. He was grim, impudent, bar- 
barous, a golden man bedecked in 
black and weaponry, with warlike 
gear that even included the archaism 
of a long knife at his belt. Hulagh 
was minded instantly and painfully 
of Medai, who had been such as 
this. It was like meeting a ghost. 

Youngling fronted youngling, and 
it was the regul that backed a pace, 
displaying a weakness that sent a 
wave of angry heat to Hulagh ’s 
head. 

“Where is the she’pan?” Hulagh 
asked sharply, embarrassed by his 
driver’s discomfiture and seeking to 
recover regul dignity. “Young mri, 
get out of the door and call some- 
one of authority. You were advised 
that I would call on the she’pan.” 

The mri turned neatly on his heel 
and walked away, silent, graceful, 
disrespectful. Mri warrior. Hulagh 
hated the whole breed. They were 
utterly unmannered as a nation, and 
encouraged this arrogance in their 
younglings. The youth, like the 
whole edun, stank of incense. The 
odor lingered in the air and Hulagh 
fought a tendency to sneeze, to 
clear his violated air passages. His 
legs were shuddering from the long 
climb upstairs. He walked in and 
bent his knees and lowered his 



heavy body the necessary small de- 
gree to sit on the carpet. Mri furni- 
ture, of which there was only the 
she’pan’s chair of honor and two 
benches near the entry, was too 
high and too fragile for an adult re- 
gul; nor could a regul stand and 
bear his own weight for any length 
of time. 

In proper courtesy the youngling 
should have summoned some of mri 
kind to bring furniture apt for him; 
but this was a very poor edun by all 
evidences, and perhaps unused to 
regul callers at all. The carpets were 
at least clean. 

Shouting echoed in the depths of 
the hall beyond the partition that 
screened the privacies of the central 
chamber. Hulagh mentally winced 
at the unseemliness of this behavior, 
and Chul stirred uneasily. In a mo- 
ment more the room began to admit 
other warriors, veiled and armed as 
the first. 

“Bai,” said Chul. There was fear 
in its tone. Hulagh dealt it a foul 
look: ignorant, this youngling. The 
mri, while graceless and arrogant, 
were still subjects of the regul, and 
they were subjects by choice, not 
by compulsion. Mri were many 
things, and they were unpleasant, 
but they were not dangerous, at 
least not in the personal sense — not 
to regul. 

Several dusei wandered in, 
heavy-boned heads low to the car- 
pet, looking as if they had lost 
something and forgotten just what it 
was. They settled their great bulks 
into a corner and lowered their 
heads between their paws and 
watched, their tiny, almost invisi- 
ble, eyes glittering. One rumbled an 
ominous sound, then quieted as a 



118 



GALAXY 




kel’en settled against him, using the 
broad, wrinkled shoulder for a back- 
rest. 

The sneeze came, unexpected and 
violent. Hulagh contained it as best 
lie could. None of the mri affected 
lo notice this terrible breach of 
eliquette. He counted those present. 
There were eleven, and nine of 
iliese were veiled: males, and 
perhaps a female, of the Kel. One 
young female was unveiled, robed 
in gold; and with her was one of the 
oldest, a presumable male, of the 
gold-robed caste. They were the 
only mri whose faces he had ever 
seen. He could not help staring, 
amazed at the graceful delicacy of 
1 1 ic young female. 

Odd, Hulagh reflected, that this 
backward species sexed when young 
and aged into sameness. He stored 
that thought away for further pon- 
dering, did mri chance to survive 
ibis era and remain relevant to the 
living. 

And with a soft rustling, the 
slie’pan herself arrived, leaning on 
die arm of the young kel’en; she 
settled among them, in her chair, 
veilless. She was also very, very 
old and, Hulagh thought, although 
lie was not sure, that she had been 
disfigured on one side of her face. 
Young mri were smooth-skinned 
and slim, and the young woman’s 
hair shone in the light like textured 
bronze, but the she’pan’s was faded 
and brittle; and on the side with the 
apparent injury, it was dark at the 
temple. 

The young warrior knelt at her 
side, golden eyes darting mistrust 
and hostility at the visitors. The 
she’pan’s look contained the placid- 
ity of age and long, long experi- 



ence, qualities that Hulagh valued; 
and he suddenly revised his opinion 
and reckoned that it might be better, 
after all, to deal with this aged 
female than with an intractable 
warleader — if she could indeed 
guide her people in areas other than 
the obscure mri religion. 

She had no great awe of regul, 
this was plain enough; but neither 
was she hostile or slow-witted. Her 
eyes were quick and appraising. 
There was the look of higher senti- 
ence in them. 

“She’pan,” said Hulagh, persist- 
ent in proprieties, “we have made 
she were mri. 

“Hulagh,” she said, stripping 
him of titles. 

His nostrils snapped shut, blew 
air in irritation. He remembered the 
presence of the youngling Chul at 
his elbow, Chul, whose witness he 
did not particularly want at this 
moment, and the heat of anger 
seethed in him as it had not in 
many sheltered years. 

“She’pan,” said Hulagh, persis- 
tent in proprieties, “we have made 
room for your people on our ship.” 

This was, basically, the truth. He 
had allotted space, which he had 
hoped would not have to be too ex- 
tensive, and he had hoped for 
younglings, who could be civilized 
and molded anew under Alagn 
guidance; but he saw only two. He 
revised opinions quickly. These el- 
ders, it might be, would be able to 
control younger mri loose 
elsewhere, render them tractable 
perhaps — even gather a colony of 
mri in Alagn territory. He thought 
again of the young kel’en who had 
suicided and thought possibly it 
would not have happened had there 



THE FADED SUN 



119 




been an elder mri to provide that 
youngling with a proper perspective 
on his act. 

If there were not that restraint 
and sense even in elders such as 
these, and if they could not have 
dissuaded him, then the whole of 
mri civilization had failed, and there 
was no rescuing it from itself. 

“We would desire,” he told the 
she’pan, “for you to board within 
the coming night. ” 

The she’pan stared at him, 
neither joyed nor dismayed by that 
short notice. “Indeed, bai?” 

“As soon as possible. We are at 
that stage of our loading.” 

The she’pan stared at him further 
and considered in silence. “And our 
dusei?” she asked. 

“And the dusei, one for each,” 
Hulagh painfully conceded, men- 
tally deducting two times the re- 
sources that would have been neces- 
sary to accommodate the mri; he 
had hoped to take no dusei at all. 
But when he considered the matter, 
he reflected that the unpleasant 
beasts might keep the mri content, 
representing their wealth; and it was 
desirable that the mri remain con- 
tent. 

“We will consult upon the mat- 
ter,” said the she’pan, her hand on 
the shoulder of the young warrior 
who sat beside her; and at her other 
side, silent, settled the gold-robed 
young female. 

“There is no time for lengthy 
consultations,” Hulagh objected. 

“Ah,” said the she’pan, “then 
you have heard about the ship.” 
Blood drained from Hulagh’s 
face, then slowly resumed its proper 
circulation. He did not look at the 
youngling, hoping that for once its 

120 



wits would prevent it from repeating 
this insult and humiliation else- . 
where, among its youngling fellows. \ 
He had scant hope that this would 
be the case. 

“Yes,” said Hulagh, “we have ] 
naturally heard. Nevertheless, we j 
are anxious to speed our departure. 
We are not familiar with this incom- 
ing ship but doubtless — ” He 
stammered over the not-truth, com- 
pelled to lie, for the first time in his 
life, for the sake of regul, for the 
welfare of the younglings in his pro- 
tection, and most of all, for his own 
ambitions and for the survival of his 
knowledge; but he felt foul and 
soiled in the doing. “ — doubtless 
after you are aboard, we may inter- 
cept this ship of yours and divert it 
also toward the safety of our inner 
zones.” 

“Would you permit that?” The 
dry old voice, heavy with accent, 
was careful, devoid of inflections 
that could have betrayed emotion 
and concealed meanings. “Shall mri 
go to the regul homeworld at long 
last? You have never permitted us , 
knowledge of its location, bai.” 

“Nevertheless — ” He could not 
build upon the lie: He was not able 
to consummate this, the supreme 
immorality — to falsify, to lend to 
memory untruth, which could not 
be unlearned. He had witnessed this 
practice of aliens. He had watched 
them use it, amazed and horrified; 
he had seen that humans lied as a 
regular practice. He felt his skin \ 
crawl at the enormity of it, his 
throat contract when he tried to 
shape more to his fiction, and knew , 
that if he refused to build upon it, it | 
would not be believed at all; then ] 
he would be caught, lose credibil- i

ity, with fatal consequences for the 
mri, with unfortunate result for the 
regul under his command, and for 
his own future. 

If it were known on Nurag. 

But they were only mri, lesser 
folk; they had no memories such as 
regul had; and with them the lie 
could not live as it would among 
regul. Perhaps therein lay at least a 
lesser immorality. 

"Nevertheless, she’pan,” he 
said, controlling his voice carefully, 
"this is so. Matters are different 
now. We will not delay here as 
long as we had planned. We will 
hoard with all possible speed.” 

"Do you fear lest the humans 
should gain us?” 

This came too near the mark. 
Hulagh sat still, looking at the 
she’pan and suspecting deeper 
things within her words. Mri were, 
like regul, truthful. He had this on 
the tradition of all his predecessors 
who had made the records that he 
had learned, on an ancestry that 
made records on the truth of which 
all the past, and therefore all the fu- 
ture, depended. 

Had the ancestors also been temp- 
led to lie, to play small games with 
truth and reality? 

Had they in fact done so? The 
very doubting increased the pace of 
Hulagh ’s overtaxed hearts, pulled 
(he foundations from beneath his 
firmest beliefs and left everything in 
uncertainty. Yet in spite of this tra- 
dition of the ancestors, a bai now 
lied — to save lives, for a good 
cause and the welfare of two 
species. But the truth had been al- 
tered, all the same, and now the lie 
shaped truth to cover it. 

“We are anxious,” said Hulagh, 



wading deeper into this alien ele- 
ment, “that you be safe from hu- 
mans. We are anxious to speed our 
own departure, for our safety’s 
sake, and for yours. Our own 
younglings are at stake, and myself, 
and my reputation, and I am ex- 
tremely valuable in the eyes of my 
people, so you may know that we 
will take unusual care to ensure the 
safety of this particular ship. If you 
wish to go with us, and I advise it, 
she’pan, I strongly advise it, then 
prepare your people to embark at 
once. ” 

“We have served regul,” said 
the she’pan, “for two thousand 
years. This is a very long service. 
And scant have been the rewards of 
it.” 

“We have offered you what you 
ask, and more. We have offered 
you technicians that would give you 
all the benefits of our experience; 
we have offered you our records, 
our histories, our technology.” 

“We do not,” said the she’pan, 
“desire this knowledge of yours.” 

“It is your own misfortune 
then,” said the bai. He had met this 
stupidity in mri before, in Medai. 
“She’pan, you keep to your own 
dwellings and to ships, but they are 
regul-built ships. Even your 
weapons are regul -made. Your food 
is produced by regul. Without us 
you would starve to death. And yet 
you still affect to despise our 
knowledge. ’.’ 

“We do not despise your knowl- 
edge,” said the she’pan. “We sim- 
ply do not desire it.” 

Hulagh ’s eyes strayed past her 
shoulder to the chamber itself, a 
gesture of contempt for the condi- 
tions in which the she’pan held 



THE FADED SUN 



121 




state: rooms barely sanitary, halls 
innocent of amenities and decorated 
with that frighteningly crude and 
powerful art of symbols, the mean- 
ing of which he doubted even the 
mri remembered. They were 
superstitious folk. If ill or injured, 
mri would turn from regul help and 
die rather than admit weakness, de- 
siring only the presence of other mri 
or the presence of a dus. This was 
their religion at work. 

Usually they died, all the same. 
We are warriors, regul had heard 
often enough, not carriers of bur- 
dens, sellers of goods, practitioners 
of arts. Medicine, engineering, lit- 
erature, agriculture, physical labor 
of any sort — all these things the mri 
despised. 

Animals, Hulagh thought, plague 
and pestilence, they are nothing but 
animals. They enjoy war. They have 
deliberately prolonged this one in 
their stupidity. We ought never to 
have unleashed them in war. They 
like it too well. 

And of the youth, the arrogant 
young kel’en who sat by the 
she’pan’s knee, he asked: “Young- 
ling, would you not wish to learn? 
Would you not wish to have the 
things that regul enjoy, to know the 
past and the future and how to build 
in metals?” 

The golden eyes nictitated, a sign 
of startlement in a mri. “I am of 
the Kel,” said the young warrior. 
“And education is not appropriate 
for my caste. Ask the Sen.” 

The young woman in gold looked 
on him in her turn, her unveiled 
face a perfect mask — infuriating to 
him — expressionless. “The Sen is 
headed by the she’pan. Ask the 
she ’pan, bai, whether she desires 

122 



your knowledge. If she bids me 
learn, then I will learn what you 
have to teach.” 

They played with him: games of 
ignorance, mri humor. Hulagh saw 
it in the eyes of the she’pan, who 
remained motionless through this 
circular exchange. 

“We know,” said the she’pan fi- 
nally, “that these things have al- 
ways been available for us. But the 
rewards of service that we desired 
were other than what you offer, and 
of late they have been scant.” 

Enigmas. The mri cherished their 
obscurities, their abstruseness. There 
was no helping such people. “If 
one of you,” Hulagh said with de- 
liberate patience, “had ever 
deigned to specify what rewards 
you sought, then we might have 
found the means to give them to 
you.” 

But the she’pan said nothing to 
this, just as the mri had always said 
nothing on this score. We serve for 
pay, some had said scornfully, simi- 
larly questioned, but they ignored 
the truth of the whole; and this 
she’pan, like her ancestors, said noth- 
ing at all. 

“It would be a comfort to my 
people,” said Hulagh, trying that 
ancient ploy, the appeal to legalities 
of oath and to mri conscience, and 
it was partly truth at least. “We are 
accustomed to the protection of mri 
with us. We are not fighters. If 
even one or two mri should be on 
the ship as we leave, we would feel 
safer in our journey.” 

“If you demand a mri for your 
protection,” said the she’pan, “I 
must send one.” 

“She’pan,” said Hulagh, at- 
tempting again to reach some point 



GALAXY 




of reason, forgetful of his dignity 
and the watching eyes of Chul. 
“Would you then send one, alone, 
without his people, to travel as far 
as we are going and without the 
likelihood of return? This would be 
hard. And what is there possibly in 
these regions to detain you once we 
have gone?” 

“Why should we not,” asked the 
she’pan, “bring our own ship in 
your wake ... to Nurag? Why are 
you so anxious to have us aboard 
your own, bai Hulagh?” 

“We have laws,” Hulagh said, 
his hearts pounding. “Surely you 
realize we must observe cautions. 
But it will be safer for you than it is 
here.” 

“There will be humans here,” 
said the she’pan. “Have you not ar- 
ranged it so?” 

Hulagh found nothing in his vast 
memory with which to understand 
that answer. It crawled uneasily 
through his thoughts, rousing ugly 
suspicions. 

“Would you,” Hulagh asked, 
compelled to directness, “change 
your allegiance and serve humans?” 

The she’pan made a faint gesture, 
one meaningless to a regul. “I will 
consult with my Husbands,” she 
said. “If it pleases you, I will send 
one of my people with you — if you 
demand it. We are in service to the 
regul. It would not be seemly or 
lawful for me to refuse to send one 
of us with you in your need, O 
Hulagh, bai of Kesrith.” 

Now, now came courtesy; he did 
not trust this late turn of manners. 
Although mri could not lie, neither 
had he thought that he could lie, be- 
fore this conference and his moment 
of necessity, which had been spent 



all in vain. Mri might indeed not 
lie, but it was unlikely that the 
she’pan was without certain sub- 
tleties, and possibly she was laugh- 
ing within this appearance of cour- 
tesy. And the Kel was veiled and 
inscrutable. 

“She’pan,” he said, “what of 
this ship that is coming?” 

“What of it?” echoed the 
she’pan. 

“Who are these mri that are com- 
ing? Of what kindred? Are they of 
this edun?” 

Again the curious gesture of the 
hand before it returned to stroke the 
head of the young female that 
leaned against her knee. 

“The name of the ship, bai, is 
Ahanal. And do you make formal 
request that one of us accompany 
you?” 

“I will tell you that when you 
have consulted with your Husbands 
and given me the answers to other 
questions,” said Hulagh, marking 
how she had turned aside his own 
question. He smoldered with grow- 
ing anger. 

These were mri. They were a lit- 
tle above the animals. They knew 
nothing and remembered less, and 
dared to play games with regul. 

He was also within their territory, 
and of law on this forsaken world, 
he was the sole representative. 

For the first time he looked upon 
the mri not as a comfort, not as in- 
terestingly quaint nor even as a nui- 
sance, but as- a force like the dusei, 
dull-wittedly ominous. He looked at 
the dark-robed warriors, their stolid 
indifference to the regul authority 
that had always commanded them. 

For mri to challenge the will of 
the regul — this had never happened, 



THE FADED SUN 



123 




not directly, not as long as mri had 
served the varied regul docha and 
authorities; Hulagh sorted through 
his memory and found no record of 
what mri conduct had been like 
when it was not a question of tradi- 
tional obedience. This was that 
most distasteful of all possible situa- 
tions, one never before experienced 
by any regul on record, one in 
which his vast memory was as use- 
less as that of a youngling, blank of 
helpful data. 

Regul in the throes of complete 
senility sometimes claimed sights of 
memories that were yet in the fu- 
ture; they saw things that had not 
yet been and on which there could 
not possibly be data. Sometimes 
these elders were remarkably accu- 
rate in their earliest estimations, 
possessing an accuracy that dis- 
turbed and defied analysis. But the 
process then accelerated and mud- 
dled all their memories, true and 
not-yet-true and never- true, and 
they went mad beyond recall. Of a 
sudden Hulagh suffered something 
of the sort, projected the potentials 
of this situation and derived an in- 
sane foreboding of these warlike 
creatures turning on him and de- 
stroying him and Chul at once, ris- 
ing against the regul docha in 
bloody frenzy. His two hearts fa- 
bored with the horror not only of 
this image but of the fact that he had 
perceived it at all. He was three 
hundred and ten years of age. He 
was bordering on decline of facul- 
ties, although he was now at the 
peak of his abilities and looked to 
be so for decades more. He was ter- 
rified lest decline have begun, here, 
under the strain of so much strange- 
ness. It was not good for an old 

124 



regul to absorb so much strangeness 
at once. 

“She’pan,” he said, trying the 
last, the very last, assault upon her 
adamancy. “You are aware that 
your ill-advised delay may make it 
impossible in the end to take any of 
your people aboard to safety.” 

“We will consult,” she said, 
which was neither aye nor nay, but 
he took it for absolute refusal, judg- 
ing that he would never in this 
world hear from the she’pan, not 
until that ship had arrived. 

There was something astir among 
mri, something that involved Kes- 
rith and did not admit regul to the 
secret; and he remembered the 
young kel’en who had suicided 
when he was denied permission to 
leave, he who would have borne the 
news of human presence to the 
she’pan already had he been al- 
lowed off that ship; and there was 
that perversity in mri that, deprived 
of their war, foretold they might be 
capable of committing racial 
suicide, a last defense against hu- 
mans who came to claim this world; 
and when humans met this defense, 
they would never believe that the 
mri were acting alone. They would 
finish the mri and move against re- 
gul: another foresight, of horrid as- 
pect. 

Mri would retreat only under di- 
rect order, and if they slipped con- 
trol, they would not retreat at all. 
Of a sudden he cursed the regul in- 
clined to believe the mri acquiescent 
in this matter: Gruran, who had 
passed him this information and 
caused him to believe in it. 

He cursed himself, who had con- 
firmed the data, who had not con- 
sidered mri as a priority, who had 



GALAXY 




been overwhelmingly concerned 
with loading the world’s valuables 
aboard Hazan, and with managing 
the humans. 

Hulagh heaved himself up, found 
his muscles still too fatigued from 
his long climb to manage his weight 
easily, and was not spared the 
humiliation of having to be rescued 
from collapse by the youngling 
Chul, that flung an arm about him 
and braced him with all its might. 

The she’pan snapped her fingers 
and the arrogant young kel’en at her 
knee rose up easily and added his 
support to Hulagh ’s right side. 

“This is very strenuous for the 
bai,” Chul said, and Hulagh men- 
tally cursed the youngling. “He is 
very old, she’pan, and this long trip 
has tired him, and the air is not 
good for him.” 

“Niun,” said the she’pan to her 
kel’en, “escort the bai down to his 
vehicle.” 

And the she’pan rose unaided and 
observed with bland face and inno- 
cent eyes as Hulagh wheezed with 
effort in putting one foot in front of 
the other. Hulagh had never missed 
his lost youth and its easy mobility; 
age was its own reward, with its 
vast memory and the honors of it, 
with its freedom from fear and with 
the services and respects accorded 
by younglings; but this was not so 
among mri. He realized with burn- 
ing indignation that the she’pan 
sought this comparison between 
them in their age, furnishing her 
people with the spectacle of the 
helplessness of a regul elder without 
his sleds and his chairs. 

Among mri, light and quick, and 
mobile even in extreme age, this 
weakness must be a curiosity. 



Hulagh wondered if mri made jest 
of regul weakness in this regard as 
regul did of mri intelligence. No 
one had ever seen a mri laugh out- 
right, not in two thousand two 
hundred two years. He feared there 
was laughter now on their veiled 
faces. 

He looked on the face of Chul, 
seeking whether Chul understood. 
The youngling looked only bewil- 
dered, frightened; it panted and 
wheezed with the burden of its own 
and another’s weight. The young 
mri at the other side did not look 
directly at either of them but kept 
his eyes respectfully averted, a 
model of decorum, and his veiled 
face could not be read. 

They passed through the steel 
doors and entered the dizzying 
windings of the painted halls, going 
down and down with agonizingly 
painful steps. For Hulagh it was a 
blur of misery, of colors and cloy- 
ing air and the possibility of a fatal 
fall; and when they finally reached 
level ground, it was blessed relief. 
He lingered there a moment, pant- 
ing, then began to walk again, lean- 
ing on them step by step. They 
passed through the doors and the 
stinging, pungent air outside came 
welcome, like the hostile sun. His 
senses cleared. He stopped again 
and blinked, in the ruddy light and 
caught his breath, leaning on them 
both. 

“Niun,” he said, remembering 
the kel’en’s name. 

“Lord?” responded the young 
mri. 

“How if I should choose you to 
go on the ship with me?” 

The golden eyes lifted to his, 
wide and, it seemed, frightened. He 



THE FADED SUN 



125 




had never seen this much evidence 
of emotion in a mri. It startled him. 

“Lord,” said the young mri, “I 
am duty-bound to the she’pan. I am 
her son. I cannot leave.” 

“Are all of you not her sons?” 
“No, lord. They are mostly her 
Husbands. I am her son.” 

“But not of her body, all the 
same.” 

The mri looked as if he had been 
struck, shocked and offended at 
once. “No, lord. My truemother is 
not here any more.” 

“Would you go on the ship Ha- 
zanT ’ 

“If the she’pan sent me, lord.” 
This one was young, without the 
duplicities, the complexities, of the 
she’pan; young, arrogant, yes, but 
such as Niun could be shaped and 
taught. Hulagh gazed at the youth- 
ful face, veiled to the eyes, finding 
it more vulnerable than was the 
wont of mri. It was rudeness to 
stare but Hulagh took the liberty of 
the very old among regul, who were 
accustomed to be harsh and abrupt 
with younglings. 

“And if I should tell you now, 
this moment, to get into the sled 
and come with me?” 

For a moment the young mri did 
not seem to know how to answer; 
or perhaps he was gathering that re- 
serve so important to a mri warrior. 
The eyes above the veil were 
frankly terrified, agonized. 

“You might be assured,” Hulagh 
said, “of safety.” 

“Only the she’pan could send 
me,” said the young kel’en. “And 
I know that she will not.” 

“She has promised me one mri.” 
“It has always been the privilege 
of the edun to choose which is to 



go and which is to stay. I tell you 
that she will not let me go with 
you, lord.” 

That was plainly spoken, and the 
obtaining of permission through ar- 
gument would doubtless mean 
another walk to the crest of the 
structure, and agony, and another 
debate with the she’pan, protracted 
and infuriating and uncertain of is- 
sue. Hulagh actually considered the 
idea but rejected it, then looked on 
the young face, trying to fix in 
mind the details that made this mri 
different from other mri. 

“What is your name, your full 
name, kel’en?” 

“Niun s’lntel Zain-Abrin, lord.” 

“Set me in my car, Niun.” 

The mri looked uncertainly re- 
lieved, as if he understood that this 
was all Hulagh was going to ask of 
him. He applied his strength to the 
task and with Chul’s considerable 
help, they slowly, carefully, with 
great gentleness, lowered Hulagh’ s 
weight into the cushions. 

Hulagh breathed a long sigh of 
exhaustion and his sight went dim 
for a moment, the blood rushing 
into his head. Then he dismissed 
the mri with an impatient gesture 
and watched him walk back to the 
doorway, agile over the eroded 
walk. The dus by the door lifted its 
head to investigate, then suddenly 
curled in the other direction and 
settled, head between its forelegs. 
Its breath puffed at the dust. The 
young mri, who had paused, van- 
ished into the interior of the edun. 

“Go,” said Hulagh to Chul, who 
switched on the vehicle and set it 
moving in a lumbering turn. And 
again: “Youngling, contact my 



126 



GALAXY 




office and see if there are any new 
developments.” 

Hulagh thought uneasily of the 
incoming ship, distant as it surely 
was, and of everything that had 
seemed so simple and settled this 
morning. He drew a breath of the 
comfortably filtered and heated air 
within the vehicle and tried to com- 
pose his thoughts. The situation was 
impossible. Humans were about to 
arrive; and if humans perceived mri 
near Kesrith and suspected treachery 
or ambush, they could arrive sooner. 
They could arrive very much 
sooner. 

Without a doubt there would be 
confrontation, mri and human, un- 
less he could rid Kesrith and Kes- 
rith’s environs of mri by one 
method or another; and of a sudden 
reckoning she ’pan Intel into mat- 
ters, Hulagh found himself unable 
to decide how things were aligned 
with mri and regul. 

Or with mri and humans. 

“Bai,” came Hada Surag-gi’s 
voice over the radio. “Be gracious. 
We have contacted the incoming 
mri ship directly. They are 
Ahanal. ” 

“Tell me something I do not al- 
ready know, youngling.” 

There was a moment’s silence. 
Hulagh regretted his temper in the 
interval for Hada had tried to do 
well, and Hada’s position was not 
enviable: a youngling trying to treat 
with mri arrogance and a bai’s im- 
patience. 

“Bai,” said Hada timidly, “this 
ship is not based on this world but 
they are intending to land. They 
say . bai. ...” 

“Out with it, youngling.”

If your husband 
had a Heart Attack 
in bed tonight, 
would you know 
what to do? 

It may go on for a little while before you 
notice. He may say it's indigestion. Or nerves. 
He may have a feeling of uncomfortable pres- 
sure, fullness, squeezing or pain in the center 
of his chest (that may spread to the shoulders, 
neck or arms) which lasts for two minutes or 
more. 

Dizziness, fainting, sweating, nausea or 
shortness of breath may also occur, but these 
signals are not always present. Sharp, stabbing 
twinges of pain are usually not signals of a 
heart attack. 

Call your emergency medical service imme- 
diately. Or, if you can get him to a hospital 
with emergency cardiac care faster in any other

He may refuse to accept the possibility that 
he is having a heart attack. Many heart attack 
victims do just that. Don't let him make you 
wait. Because seconds count. Get help and 
get it fast. 

Remember, if it isn’t a heart attack, it doesn’t 
matter. If it is, nothing matters more.

sunfall, over Kesrith’s city tomor- 
row. They . have arrived close, 
dangerously close, bai. Our station 
was monitoring the regular ap- 
proaches, the lanes — but they ig- 
nored them.” 

Hulagh blew his breath out softly 
and refrained from swearing. 

“Be gracious,” said Hada. 

“Youngling, what else?” 

“They rejected outright our 
suggestion they dock at the station.

They want to land at the port. We 
disputed their right to do so under 
the treaty and explained that our 
facilities were damaged by the 
weather. They would not hear. 
They say that they have need of 
provisioning^ We protested they 
could obtain this at the station. 
They would not hear. They demand 
complete re -provisioning and re- 
equippage of a class-one vessel with 
armaments, as on war status. We 
protested that we could not do these 
things. But they demand these 
things, bai, and they claim . 
they claim that they number in 
excess of four hundred mri on 
that ship.” 

A chill flowed over Hulagh’s 
thick skin. 

“Youngling,” he said, “in all 
known space there are only five 
hundred thirty-three of the species 
known to survive, and thirteen of 
those are presently on Kesrith and 
another is recently deceased.” 

“Be gracious,” pleaded Hada. 
“Bai, I am very sure I heard accu- 
rately. I asked them to repeat the 
figure.” He paused. Then, “It is 
possible,” he added in a voice 
trembling and wheezing with dis- 
tress, “that these are all the mri 
surviving in the universe.” 

“Plague and perdition,” said 
Hulagh softly, and he reached for- 
ward to prod Chul in the shoulder. 
“The port.” 

“Bai?” asked Chul, blinking. 

“The port,” Hulagh repeated. 
“O young ignorance, the port. 
Make for it.” 

The car veered off left, corrected, 
followed the causeway the neces- 
sary distance, then turned left along 
the passable margin of the city,

bouncing over scrub, presenting oc- 
casionally a view of the pinkish sky 
and the distant mountains, Kesrith’s 
highlands, and then revealing white, 
barren sands and the slim, twisting 
trunks of scrub luin. 

To this the humans fell heir. 

Good riddance to them. 

He began to think again of the 
mri that had suicided and, with re- 
peated chill, of the remaining mri 
that had by that time already tended 
toward Kesrith — all the mri that 
survived anywhere, coming to their 
homeworld, which was falling to 
the control of humans. 

Coming to die? 

He wished he could trust it were 
so simply final. To stop the hu- 
mans; to breathe life into the war 
again; to ruin the peace and the 
regul at once, and then, being few, 
to die themselves and leave the 
regul species at the mercy of out- 
raged humans: This was like the 
mri. 

He began to think, his double 
hearts laboring with fear, of what 
choice he had in dealing with the 
mercenaries; and as he had never 
lied before he dealt with mri, so he 
had never before contemplated vio- 
lence with his own hands; for this 
the mri had been hired as inter- 
mediaries. 

The sled made a rough turn to- 
ward the port gate, bouncing pain- 
fully over ruts. The disrepair was 
evident even here. 

He saw with utter apprehension 
that clouds had gathered again over 
the hills beyond the city.

Clarke’s The View from Serendip, 
subtitled, “Speculations on Space, 
Science, and the Sea, Together with 
Fragments of an Equitorial Au- 
tobiography.” 

Prolog: Arthur C. Clarke’s The 
View from Serendip : etc. etc. etc. 
is not really worth reading. But it 
did tell me a few things I would 
like to pass along to you. 

Chapter 1: Consumer Tips 

Is that novel you just bought, 
really a novel? Is that book of essays, 
really a book of essays? Do you 
give a damn? If so, before you buy, 
check the copyright page. That 
novel may actually be a collection 
of short stories, or that book of es- 
says, a collection of hack jour- 
nalism. 

If the original sources for the 
stories or articles were magazines 
like Vogue and Playboy, don’t ex- 
pect much. The same is true of 
newspapers, or popular science 
magazines, with the exception of 
the New York Times. If the original 
sources were speeches, shudder 
quietly and steal away. 

The View from Serendip is com- 
posed entirely of such things, tied 
together with a not very interesting 
autobiographical commentary to 
create the appearance of a book. 

Let’s get this straight: I am an in- 
corrigible Clarke fan. Of his fiction, 
that is. The few times I have tried 
to read his non-fiction, I have gotten 
about ten pages. In The View from 
Serendip, I read all 273 pages, and 
about halfway I had the image of 
myself as a cartoon character who 
inadvertently stuck his head into a 
garbage can only to have it struck 
violently with a hammer, leaving 



his head vibrating like a bell. Such 
was the boredom of it. 

Of course, Clarke is not a boring 
man. When he sticks to hard facts 
or descriptive writing, he is actually 
interesting, but most of this book 
consists of rhapsodic sermons on 
the future promise of technology 
that are tediously repetitious. And 
when he talks of skin diving or his 
beloved Ceylon, he talks more like 
a p. r . man than an observer. 

There is a good book here, but he 
has not chosen to write it. The au- 
tobiographical fragments that link 
the hack-work articles are deliber- 
ately, and irritatingly, personable. 
Clarke is unlike any other En- 
glishman I have ever read. I mean, 
one expects a high degree of disdain 
for personal “likeableness” from 
the English. They impress rather 
than beguile. But Clarke is too anx- 
ious we should think of him as “a 
regular guy”. And he succeeds only 
to the extent that we can’t help 
thinking of him as a bit of an ass. 

He has, to use his own words, a 
“schoolboy humor” that would be 
better suited to a fanzine than a pro- 
fessional work. He drops names, all 
of whom are' “very dear friends,” 
and quotes himself, even before 
congressional committees, shame- 
lessly. And he can be embarrassing- 
ly naive as when he says of space 
flight: 

“There may be setbacks — 
perhaps even disasters — in the years 
ahead; it is Unreasonable to suppose 
that the conquest of a new and 
strange environment will not de- 
mand its toll. But men have never 
hestitated to pay the price, in blood 
as well as treasure, of exploration 
and discovery. Nor will they hesi-

tate now, as they stand, for the se- 
cond time in a thousand years, on 
the frontiers of a new world.” 

I can just see a NASA exec 
chewing his fingernails as he reads 
that one. 

Or: . there can sometimes 

be a total transformation (of life 
styles) literally overnight . who 
would have dared to predict, as re- 
cently as 1965, that by the begin- 
ning of the seventies, the President 
of the United States would visit Pe- 
king, the American Medical Associa- 
tion would be debating the legality 
of marijuana, abortion would be re- 
spectable, total stage and screen 
nudity would have started to be- 
come boring . and the yen would 
be mightier than the dollar?” 

To anyone living outside the 
States, or in a great metropolitan 
area, it might seem as if these 
things did constitute “a total trans- 
formation; ” but to anyone closer to 
the situation, it is simply not so. 
Had Kennedy been a Republican, 
he could have gone to Peking. Had 
Nixon been a Democrat, we might 
still be in Vietnam. The legality and 
morality of marijuana are accepted 
primarily by those parents whose 
children use it and porn is as profit- 
able as ever (no one but adolescents 
and sexologists ever found it any- 
thing but boring). In any case, what 
Clarke sees as overnight change is 
more a matter of fashion than of 
substance. Societies do not change 
uniformly, and changes that seem 
radical at the moment usually have 
a long history of having gone in and 
out of fashion throughout the cen- 
turies. 

Or: 

“What we are seeing now — 
132 



largely as a result of space 
technology — is the establishment of 
supernational, global-service organi- 
zations in which all governments, in 
their own sheer self-interest, will 
simply ha ve to cooperate.” 

But governments have always 
cooperated in their own sheer self- 
interest. There has never been a war 
that did not involve the cooperation 
of two or more previously at-odds 
governments. But “all govern- 
ments” cooperate with one another? 
For what ends? “For education,” 
Mr. Clarke would respond. “For 
the welfare of their people.” Real- 
ly? 1 can think of other possibilities 
myself. In any event, educational 
cooperation would not preclude hos- 
tilities. 

The problem with supernational 
global service organizations, 
whether they are educational or 
economic, is that they represent the 
ultimate form of imperalism; for 
whoever dominates the technology 
of the organization is in a position 
to impose their values upon the rest 
of the world — whether they mean to 
or not. And the cultural conse- 
quences of the imposition of one soci- 
ety’s values upon a very different 
culture are invariably unpleasant, 
not only for the society, but for the 
world. 

Still, 1 am not opposed to the 
idea. Or to any of Clarke’s ideas 
per se. I simply want to show from 
these quotes how simplistic Clarke’s 
thinking is. 

By far, the most embarassing ex- 
change is between Clarke and a 
Congressman Downing during hear- 
ings of the House Committee on 
Space Science. 

Downing says, “I want to know 

GALAXY 




how, in your opinion, do we best 
sell the space program to the 
American taxpayer, as we go into 
the less-dramatic phases of the 
space program?” (Who says politi- 
cians equivocate?) 

To which Clarke responds, “One 
thing will help you: when the first 
real space products start hitting the 
market . when people start 
seeing — as 1 think they will in the 
next decade — products which are 
literally made in space, they’ll 
begin to understand.” 

Want to bet? 

Clarke’s problem here as ev- 
erywhere is he thinks of people 
inonolithically. “All people”, “all 
governments”. Why was the space 
program ultimately a bore? In my 
opinion, it never was. Certainly the 
news coverage of it was boring. 
If the newsmen had simply left the 
mikes open, and the cameras run- 
ning, and hardly said another word 
except to explain a thing or two, I 
suspect millions of Americans 
would have stayed up sleeplessly 
night after night just watching and 
listening, utterly fascinated. Instead, 
they felt compelled to make it in- 
teresting, to give the impression at 
all times that “something” was 
happening. That was what made 
it so boring. 

Historical events speak for them- 
selves and are best left to speak for 
themselves alone. Like great books 
or other works of art, they may 
have long tedious stretches, but 
cumulatively, their fascination is 
overwhelming. 

Science itself is like that. It too 
speaks for itself. But not everyone 
cares for what it has to say. In past 
months, I have read or heard im- 



passioned pleas from musicans and 
composers and poets and critics and 
physicists and ballet dancers and 
marine biologists and ecologists and 
God-knows how many others all 
decrying the public’s lack of 
wholehearted attention. And money. 
For according to these people their 
discipline, and their discipline 
alone, is the key to world peace, 
and all men will never be brothers 
until they learn all there is to know 
about it. 

But what does it mean to learn 
enough about a thing? Victor Borge 
put it succintly. When asked how 
long it had taken him to learn to 
play the “Minute Waltz,’ he re- 
plied, “Fifteen years.” 

That’s about the size of it, pil- 
grim.

George ‘'Rage Rage” Martin's For- 
lorn W or lorn 

I liked George R.R. Martin’s 
Dying of the Light very much. I re- 
commend it wholeheartedly to all 
hard-sf fans. I predict it will be 
nominated for a Hugo. I might even 
vote for it myself. And if it is an 
especially bad year for sf, I would 
not be surprised if it won. 

The novel does have its faults. 
Perhaps more of them than it has 
virtues; but when I come across 
passages like: 

Other plant life was scarce, 
except for beds of black and vio- 
let mushrooms near the feet of 
the yellow trees, and ropes of 
parasitic scumweb. 

But there were animals.

Dirk saw them moving 
through the dark twistings of the 
chokers and heard their high, 
chittering call. Finally he saw 
one. Sitting just above their 
heads on a swollen yellow 
branch, looking down on them; 
fist-sized, dead still, and some- 
how — transparent. He touched 
Gwen’s shoulder and nodded 
upward. 

But she just smiled for him 
and laughed lightly. Then she 
reached up to where the little 
creature sat and crumpled it in 
her hand. When she offered it to 
Dirk, her palm held only dust 
and dead tissue. 

“There’s a nest of tree spooks 
around,” she explained. “They 
shed their skins four or five 
times before maturity and leave 
the husks as guards to scare 
away other predators.” She 
pointed. “There’s a live one if 
you’re interested.” 

Dirk looked and caught a fleet- 
ing glimpse of a tiny yellow 
scampering thing with sharp 
teeth and enormous brown eyes. 
“They fly too,” Gwen told 
him . 

Or: 

“Jelly children,” it seemed, 
was a popular nickname for the 
followers of a pseudo- religious 
drug cult on the World of the 
Blackwine Ocean. They were so 
called because they spent years 
at a time living in the cavernous 
inner dampness of kilometer-long 
gelatinous slugs that crept with 
infinite slowness along the bot- 



tom of their seas. The cultists 
called the creatures Mothers. The 
Mothers fed their children with 
sweet hallucinogenic secretions 
and were believed to be semi- 
sentient. 

As 1 was saying, when 1 come 
across passages like those. I’m sold, 
regardless of my other reservations. 
If only there were a dozen more of 
them . 

Dying of the Light is an ambi- 
tious thematic novel that 1 would 
have to read at least once more to 
say with confidence what it was 
about. Let’s say it is about dying 
gracefully, for everyone and every- 
thing in it is dying in one way or 
another. 

The main protagonist is Dirk 
t’Larien. We first meet him on Ava- 
lon where he is dying of an empty 
life. He receives a message from his 
former love, Gwen, in the form of a 
“whisperjewel,” a gem in which 
her words and feelings have been 
psionically etched. She needs him. 
He goes to her. 

Gwen is an ecologist. She has 
married a man named Jaan Vikary 
of the planet High Kavallaan, a 
world whose customs require ritual 
dueling among its male inhabitants 
as well as the sharing of one’s wife 
with one’s “teyn” (something like 
a blood brother). Women have no 
rights whatever. They are property. 
“Beytheyn,” which literally means 
“heldwife,” implies no bond of af- 
fection. In fact, the Kavalars have 
no word for love. 

The Kavalars are descendants of 
refugees who fled the “Double 
War” and the wrath of the tyranni- 
cal Hrangans and formed an isolated 



134 



GALAXY 




and unpleasant little civilization 
which soon forgot its origins and 
substituted a male-oriented mythol- 
ogy, the nature of which Jaan Vik- 
ary, a historian, is only now begin- 
ning to discover. 

t’Larien finds Gwen with Vikary 
and his teyn, Garse, a brutal but 
not insensitive man, on the planet 
Worlorn, a rogue world momentar- 
ily given life by its passage round a 
bright star cluster. For a while, 
Worlorn was a center of attraction, 
the setting for the great Festival of 
Worlds, in which many cultures 
built cities to show off their status. 
Now, it has begun to move away 
from the suns of the “Wheel of 
Fire” into eternal twilight, and it is 
all but deserted by humanity. 

On a dying world then, Martin 
brings together a strange collection 
of people. t’Larien, whose only 
hope is a woman who does not love 
him. Gwen, the woman, who 
wishes to love both t’Larien and 
Vikary, and is thwarted by their in- 
ability to accept her as herself. Vik- 
ary, who wants her as much as 
t’Larien but must compromise his 
deepest principles to have her. And 
Garse and the other Kavalars who 
have come to the dying Worlorn to 
hunt the remaining humans, whom 
they regard as animals, “mockmen.” 
They too are dying, as their cul- 
ture is as moribund as Worlorn 
itself. 

And then there is the curious, 
treacherous little Kimdissi, Ruark, 
who would be the puppeteer, play- 
ing one off against the other to gain 
his own ends. His fate, also, in- 
volves death. 

If this sounds intriguing, it is, ul- 
timately. If it also sounds rather 



hokey and theatrical, it is that, too. 
Martin is not above cornball melo- 
dramatics as in: 

She was weeping; slow tears 
moved trembling down her 
cheeks. Kyrne Lamiya (a city 
that sings) wept with her, the 
towers crying in their lament. 
But it mocked her too, as if to 
say. Yes, I see your grief, but 
grief has no more meaning than 
anything else, pain us as empty 
as pleasure. The spires wailed, 
thin gratings laughed insanely, 
and the low far-off drum went: 
boom, boom, boom,.” 

P.U., P.U., P.U. 

The trouble is that t’Larien is the 
least interesting character in the 
book. A sap and a victim from be- 
ginning to end. Gwen is a pain in 
the ass. And their interminable 
dialogues are repetitious, filled with 
ideological accusuations, and 
breast-beating, soul-searching, self 
pity and self-righteousness. Two of 
the least appealing lovers in fiction. 

By far, the most fascinating char- 
acter is Jaan Vikary, a man of great 
integrity and sensitivity who has a 
problem worthy of Greek tragedy. 
If Martin had realized what he had 
in Vikary, he would have written a 
far better book, but as it is, Vikary 
pops in and out and is generally .rel- 
egated to the shadows. 

Garse and the Kimdissi rival one 
another for second place. They too 
have their problems involving love 
and loyalty, which are infinitely 
more interesting than t’Larien’s. 

Then, there is Worlorn itself. Ab- 
solutely fascinating in its potential, 
but given slight attention. 



BOOKSHELF 



135 




The problem is that Martin talks 
too much; or rather, his characters 
do. For almost the entire first 
hundred pages, there are nothing 
but lectures by one character after 
another on the nature of Kavalar so- 
ciety, which in itself, is less in- 
teresting than Worlorn in that what 
it ultimately amounts to is a deep 
space version of the Wild West with 
the brutal good guys versing the 
brutal bad guys. In fact, the plot of 
the novel itself is really a western 
with a big shootout at the end. 

Martin has yet to master his craft, 
but for all his faults, he has the 
kind of imagination that makes sci- 
ence fiction worth reading. If he is 
sometimes tedious, he is never dull. 
If he is sometimes corny, he is 
never trite. And whenever his char- 
acters stop jabbering, and he de- 
scribes the world around them, he 
comes instantly and vividly and ex- 
citingly to life. 

Once more, for all its faults, the 
plot works in the end. It is an effec- 
tive, affecting story, and Martin 
does persuade us to care for ev- 
eryone eventually. If he is incapable 
of achieving the subtlety he aimed 
for, he does achieve a thrilling 
climax and a moving finale, both of 
which make the book more than just 
another promising first novel. 

If you like Martin at all, you will 
like this. 

And finally, I would like to say a 
word in praise of Haruo Miyauchi, 
who possesses the subtlety that Mar- 
tin lacks. He has painted a cover for 
the novel that has me scratching my 
head yet. Is the figure in the cell 
looking out? Or are we in the cell 
looking in? Scratch, scratch, 
scratch.

Swords and Sorority 

Tanith Lee is an Englishwoman. 
Born September 19, 1947. Raised 
and lives in London. Was a library 
assistant, worked at a variety of 
clerical jobs, attended an art col- 
lege. She is unmarried. Her hobbies 
include painting, mythology, and 
archeology, and her musical favor- 
ites are Shostakovich and Prokofiev, 
which is good enough for me. 

She has written a number of 
novels, but Companions on the 
Road is the first for me. A while 
back, when I had been away from 
sf for some time, the distinguished 
editor of this pulp called me to say 
he wanted to buy me a copy of her 
first novel, The Birthgrave, and I 
declined. An action which I now 
regret. Pierce’s opinion is right 
more often than not, and he was 
very excited about Tanith Lee. 

Now, I must add yet another 
“must” to my interminable list of 
“books to be read.” 

I loved Companions on the Road. 

Let me make that perfectly clear. 
There are books I love that I am 
content to love for themselves 
alone. I may even forget the name 
of the author. But then there are 
books that I love not for themselves 
but for their authors, and Com- 
panions on the Road is one of 
them. If not for my duties to this 
column, I would immediately buy 
up all the Tanith Lee I could find 
and read nothing else until I had 
done. 

And when 1 was finished, I sus- 
pect if anyone asked me to recom- 
mend just one of them I could not 



136 



GALAXY 




do it. That’s the way it usually 
works out. Not always, of course. 1 
have sometimes loved a book by a 
writer 1 found otherwise unreadable. 
But that is rare. 

Companions on the Road com- 
prises two short novels published 
separately in England and wisely 
brought together by St. Martin’s 
here in America. Which one did I 
like best? I don’t know. I loved 
them both. 

The title story is about three ill- 
fated survivors of a great battle in 
which the city Avillis was de- 
stroyed. The city was ruled by a 
Dark Lord and his two gruesome 
children who practiced black magic 
and human sacrifice. The chief in- 
strument of their evil was a golden 
cup. 

The hero of the piece is a noble 
young warrior named Havor who, 
together with a sneering, belligerant 
companion named Feluce, and a 
thief named Kachil, steal the cup 
and attempt to ride off into the sun- 
set to enjoy their ill-gotten gains, 
thinking the Dark Lord and his sib- 
lings dead in the fire that consumed 
their castle. 

Such, alas (as they say in these 
books), is not the case. 

One by one, they are visited by 
lethal dreams until Havor alone re- 
mains, fleeing across the icy wil- 
derness pursued by the evil trio. 

It is what happens next that 
“made” the book for me. 

The second, and equally good (if 
not better) short novel is “The 
Winter Players,” in which a young 
priestess of a small and undistin- 
guished shrine is visited by a mys- 
terious warrior who demands one of 
the three sacred relics in her posses- 



sion. She refuses. He returns. She 
fights. He wins by turning into a 
wolf and running off with the relic. 

She is compelled to break a long 
tradition and leave her seaside vil- 
lage to go in pursuit. A pursuit she 
finds made dangerously difficult by 
the obstacles the warrior has put in 
her path, including telling everyone 
he meets that he is followed by a 
witch who must be killed on sight. 

Toward the end she finds him, 
and discovers he is the least of her 
troubles; for she has a far more 
deadly enemy who is intent on using 
her for his evil ends. 

Not bad. But it is what happens 
next that “made” the book for me. 

I am not being facetious. Tanith 
Lee has one of those imaginations 
that takes that extra step writers 
must take to distinguish their work. 
She is unpredictable. So if what 1 
have told you leads you think she is 
merely another sword-and-sorcerer, 
forget it. There is a whole other 
dimension of quality in her work 
that makes it the most promising 
I’ve seen since Le Guin’s Wizard 
series. 

Lee is quoted as saying she is in- 
terested in stories of horror and the 
supernatural with the idea that all 
people are capable of witchcraft if 
given enough impetus. And that 
pretty well sums up the psychology 
involved in both of these novels. 
No spectral rabbits pulled conveni- 
ently from black hats, but solid psy- 
chological groundwork. 

Her writing is a bit too terse for

ful example of her writing: 

The winter sea was cold and 
grey as the voices of the gulls 
that flew over it, but where it en- 
tered the bay before the little 
shrine, the water turned to a sour 
vinegar green. Most of the lower 
steps that led down from the wall 
of shrine to the water were also 
green, dark as slabs of raw 

emerald, for the sea covered 
them at hightide. When the 
storms came, waves would 
smash over the wall of the

Bravo, Tanith!

Dashiell Haldeman 

If Joe Haldeman’s All My Sins 
Remembered is not as good as his 
The Forever War, it is better than 
Mindbridge, although not as in- 
teresting. And if that sounds confus- 
ing, it is because evaulating any 
novel by Joe Haldeman always 
leaves me a little confused as to 
what I really think and feel. I’m not 
sure I liked The Forever War, al- 
though I felt it deserved the awards 
it got, and I would not hesitate to 
recommend it to everyone. I’m not 
even sure if I like Haldeman. But I 
admire him more than just about 
any other new writer in the field. 



There is so much to admire. And 
all of it can be put into one word: 
ability. 

Maybe you have to be a writer to 
appreciate how good Haldeman 
really is in the absolute command of 
his materials and in his craft, which 
he demonstrates in everything he 
does. It takes most writers many 
years of hard work just to get where 
he started from; and few ever get 
there entirely. 

Yet as good as Haldeman is, 
none of his writings so far have 
been entirely satisfactory. A 
Haldeman story is like a brilliantly 
polished machine, bright and fas- 
cinating to watch in action, but still 
a machine, hard and cold to the 
touch. 

Not that Haldeman is without 
feeling: Sentiment and emotion and 
ideological bias abound in his 
works; but they are bound them- 
selves, straitjacketed in an austere 
technique that, while admirable for 
its succinctness, precludes full ex- 
pression of anything except itself. 
One comes to hope for a single 
purple passage, a solitary melo- 
dramatic moment. But all is as tight 
as a drum. 

All My Sins Remembered is no 
exception. It has the familiar ele- 
ments. The conscience-struck hero 
forced to do evil in the name of 
good; the wonderful alien life forms 
Haldeman does better than anyone 
else; the atmospheric worlds; the 
treacherous government agency. 

It is not a novel but rather a col- 
lection of three short novels linked 
by imaginative sections called “Re- 
dundancy Checks,” which show the 
hero’s progression from age twenty- 
two to forty-five, when he is ig-

nominiously relieved from duty. 

Otto McGavin is a young man 
with the reflexes of a cat. He wants 
to do good — specifically to join the 
vastly powerful Confederacion that 
is charged with the responsibility of 
defending the interests of extrater- 
restrial species. 

Although Otto is a man who de- 
plores violence, he quickly finds 
himself one of the most violent and 
dangerous men in the galaxy: an 
agent of a top-secret organization 
called TBU, a sort of galactic FBI. 

His first assignment, and the one 
I liked best, is called “To Fit the 
Crime.” Here Otto is sent to the 
dismal world of Bruuch to investi- 
gate the premature deaths of a 
strange hirsute species which loves 
nothing better than to die. 

His second “episode,” as the 
stories are called, is “The Only 
War We’ve Got,” which so bored 
me I no longer remember what it 
was about and I just finished the 
book yesterday. Oh, yes, it is about 
Otto’s attempt to stop an interplane- 
tary war. Interminably talkative. 

The third is “All My Sins 
Remembered” — about Otto’s so- 
journ as the priestly head of an 
unholy order. He is trying to learn 
the secret of a beetle-like species 
that, it seems, moved its entire 
planet by some means known only 
to itself. As in the first episode, it 
is the wonderful aliens themselves 
that make the story entertaining. 
They are the sort of characters that 
make you want to know more about 
them. 

I wish I could say the same of 
Otto McGavin. His plight is that he 
must be turned into a different 
human being for every assignment.

so he is always only ten per cent 
himself and ninety per cent some 
other, usually disagreeable, person. 
And even the ten per cent that is 
himself is an absolute slave to the 
system that exists for the welfare of 
none other than itself. 

The trouble with Otto’s plight is 
similar to that suffered by any tv 
series hero. He never ever does re- 
ally change from one story to the 
next. He is in all instances — at least 
to me — a normal, well-adjusted, 
hell-of-a-nice-guy who is never be- 
lievable as a ruthless hired gun. 

Nevertheless, All My Sins Re- 
membered is a “must” as is every- 
thing else Haldeman has written so 
far. And I want to put in a good 
word for the cover by Paul Stinson. 
Like most sf covers, it seems to 
have one detail too many, but I 
could not make myself dispose of a 
single one of them. 



Department of Interesting, if Ines- 
sential, Information 

A while back 1 reviewed Robert 
Aickman’s very fine collection of 
ghost stories called Cold Hand in 
Mine. 1 referred to suspected “au- 
tobiographical” elements in his 
work, but the back flap did not 
have much to offer about the man. 
So I did some investigation and 
have come up with a biographical 
sheet that may be of some interest. 

Aickman is the grandson of a 
popular novelist, Richard Marsh, 
who wrote a supernatural novel 
called “The Beetle,’’ of which I’ve 
heard but never read. Aickman is 
interested in psychic research and 



figures in two works on the subject 
published by the Society for Psychi- 
cal Research. He is part-author 
(with Elizabeth Howard) of a 
book on psychic phenomena called 
We Are for the Dark . 

The remainder of this long, 
single-spaced, biographical sheet is 
awesome in its credentials. 
Aickman belongs to everything. He 
received some training as an ar- 
chitect; was drama and film and 
opera critic; director of an opera so- 
ciety specializing in neglected 
operas; chairman of a company that 
sponsors a ballet company; founder 
of the Inland Waterways Associa- 
tion (“advocating the better main- 
tenance and fuller use of British 
rivers and canals”). In fact, this last 
seems to be a passion of his. He be- 
longs to all sorts of related organi- 
zations and has written the most 
popular book on the subject: Know 
Your Waterways. 

The remainder of his activities 
(founder of this, chairman of that, 
director of one thing, vice president 
of another) is staggering. Only in 
England! 

He is editor of the Fontana Book 
of Great Ghost Stories and its eight 
successors. His own books include 
The Late Breakfasters, Dark En- 
tries, Sub Rosa and Powers of 
Darkness, to mention a few. 

I know at least two knowledge- 
able fans who disagree with my 
high opinion of his work, claiming 
that Aickman tends to write the 
same story over and over again, but 
I did not find that to be the case in 
Cold Hand in Mine. If you like a 
good classy ghost story, I recom- 
mend it highly ★

I’ll get the column to you right 
away, J. J. Do not worry. You can 
depend on Alter-Ego to come

I’ve been with Geis long enough to 
know — Oh, please, J.J. Don’t weep 
with gratitude like that. The column 
will be on your desk on Tuesday at 
the latest. All about how to publish 
a science fiction fan magazine. Yes. 
Yes. Of course I know how impor- 
tant my column is to GALAXY. 
Yes. Yes. Okay. Right. Goodbye. 

Hmm. Well, now. I think I’d bet-

Hey, Geis wake up! I’ve got 
great news for you. 

*Mwerzap?* *Snorppl* 

“Wha . .? What’s ... Oh. YOU! 
What did you wake me up for?” 

Geis, I have good news! 

“You’re leaving my brain to be-

devil another poor soul to near- 
madness? Who’s the victim-to-be? 
President Carter? Harlan Ellison? 
David Rockefeller? All good, de- 
serving men. Or will it be a wom- 
an? Is it — ” 

None of the above, Geis. I’m not 
leaving you. The news is that I’m 
going to begin publishing my own 
sf fan magazine, and I need some 
pointers. 

“Oh. Oh? You’re going to pub- 
lish a fan magazine? I find that 
laughable .... no! I find it sus- 
picious! Are you going to compete 
with my Science Fiction Review ?” 

No, no, no,. Just a little personal 
publication, nothing fancy. No need 
to worry, Geis. But I need to know 
some things about methods of pro- 
duction, dealing with the post 
office, costs, wliere to get outside 
material, how much to charge for it. 



141 



“Aha! Knowledge I’ve accumu- 
lated over twenty-three years of 
fan-pubbing you want to rip off in 
a few short minutes! Typical. The 
answer is no!” 

I’ll dip a tentacle down into your 
midbrain pleasure node and give it a 
five minute tickle if you’ll help me. 

*Gasp!* “Five minutes of non- 
stop orgasms? Whatdoyouwantto- 
know?” 

Well, for starters, what’s the best 
method of producing a fanzine? 

“The best, easiest method is the 
most expensive. Have it printed by 
a local budget printing firm. Write 
what you want on a sheet of 8% x 
1 1 white paper, and they’ll run off 
as many copies as you want. It’ll 
cost you about $4 for 100 copies. 
Two sides printed costs about $8 
per hundred.” 

Ummn. That do get dear, don’t 
it? What’s the least expensive way 
of printing a fanzine? 

“Oh . maybe having free use 
of a spirit duplicating machine — a 
Ditto machine. Uses carbon masters 
and prints purple on the paper. 
Other color masters are available, of 
course, but purple is less expensive. 
The masters cost about 10 cents a 
sheet, standard 8 Vi x 11 size. A ream 
of paper is about $2.75. The cupli- 
cating fluid which transfers the ana- 
line dye from the typed master to 
the paper is maybe $10 a gallon 
and lasts a long, long time.” 

What if I want to use artwork in 
my fanzine? 

“That’s a whole different bag of 
problems, Alter. With offset you 
can just paste your artwork onto 
your copy page and that’s it. No 
sweat. But with the Ditto process 
you have to draw right on the mas- 

142 



ter . or have your artist draw on 
the master. In the old days, when i 
most fanzines were produced by 
spirit duplication, or mimeo, some 
remarkably good artwork was 
created by artists working with pur- 
ple, black, red, green, and brown 
sheets of analine dye carbon. It may 
be a lost art now. *Sob* Weep for 
the Good Old Days.” 

Don’t get mawkish and nostalgic 
on me, Geis! Just tell me the advan- 
tages and disadvantages of Ditto 
duplicating. 

“It’s cheap but you can only get 
about 150 really good, clear copies 
from a long-run master, and you’re 
likely to have purple dye stains on 
your fingers for a long time. Those 
stains used to be the mark of a tru- 
fan.” 

You mentioned mimeo? 

“Sure, mimeography was, and 
still is, the primary method pro- 
ducing fanzines. But don’t buy a 
mimeo just to start your own fan- 
zine. Unless you have access to a 
mimeo it would be cheaper to go 
the budget offset route. The mimeo 
companies are pricing themselves 
out of sight lately. For the price of 
the best mimeo made — a Gestetner 
466 — you can buy a tabletop AB 
Dick offset press. Of course the 
offset is more expensive to use and 
maintain. Now — ” 

How much for that Gestetner or 
the AB Dick offset? 

“Too much for a beginning fan 
editor, Alter. You’re looking at 
around $1500. just to buy the 
machine. Then there are 
supplies ...” 

Yeah. I believe you. Unless I can 
use a mimeo free, I can forget buy- 
ing a mimeo. 



GALAXY 




“Unless you can get one cheap 
from some business or church or 
private person who wants to unload 
one. In that case you’ll probably 
face expenses for new rollers, ink 
feed, cleaning, adjustments, etc. 
Reconditioning by itself could cost 
several hundred bucks. 1 tell you, 
prices today . .” 

Okay, let’s say I can use some- 
body’s in-good-condition mimeo. 
And I know how to type a stencil. 
What about artwork? How do I get 
that on a stencil? 

“Nowdays, Alter, there are such 
things as electronic stencil-cutting 
machines. They will scan and 
“burn” a photo or a piece of 
artwork onto a rubberized stencil. 
They do a fine job, too. But it isn’t 
like in the old days when a fan had 
to use styluses (or styli), shading 
plates, and skill in tracing or copy- 
ing or creating on-stencil 
. cutting the wax, knowing 
exactly how much pressure to use 
without tearing the stencil and 
ruining hours of work. Ah, I re- 
member one time — ” 

Forget it, Geis, Now is now. 
Hand-tooled stenciling is a thing of 
the past. Lost art. Tell me more 
about electronic stencils. 

“You don’t appreciate the Old 
Ways, Alter. You’re like all these 
young whippersnappers nowadays 
who don’t have no respect for — ” 
Terminal boredom is setting in! 
Electronic stencils! 

“All right! You can do elaborate 
professional layouts, paste-up the 
headings and artwork on white pa- 
per, paste in the text, and you can 
have the whole page copied onto an 
electronic stencil. Or you can get 
different effects by making up two 



stencils for copying, run one stencil 
in a different color ink, on the 
mimeo, make a color change, and 
run the other stencil in a different 
color, all on the same page, by run- 
ning the paper through again, with 
each stencil. Many possibilities. All 
it needs is care and a willingness to 
take the extra time.” 

So how much does it cost to have 
one of these electronic stencils cut? 

“Some places will do it for as lit- 
tle as $2.50. Some charge up to $6. 
Hell, for twelve or so hundred dol- 
lars you can buy your own elec- 
tronic stencil cutting machine.” 

Geis, didn’t you once tell me it 
was possible to have a lot of small 
pieces of art put onto an electronic 
stencil and then cut them from the 
stencil and glue them onto a regular 
stencil, so a fan editor could have 
spot illustrations on his typed sten- 
cils, without having to have the typ- 
ing electronically copied, too, at 
great expence? 

“Yes, but the technique of cut- 
ting a smaller hole in the regular 
stencil, gluing the segment of elec- 
tronic stencil over the hole with 
stencil cement, doing it without 
wrinkles or seams or leaks ... is 
too complicated ' to describe here. 
It is a skill acquired after deep 
thought and many curses signifying 
disasters.” 

Sounds to me, Geis, like elabo- 
rate mimeography is an expensive, 
time-consuming, frustrating drag. 

“Correct, Alter. And only a few 
readers of yoiir fanzine will ap- 
preciate it; fine mimeography looks 
very much like, offset printing, and 
offset, unless you do it yourself, is 
nothing to take credit for.” 

So what should a young, eager 

143 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 




would-b^ fan editor do? Spend all 
his money on offset, or mess 
around with mimeo or spirit du- 
plicating? 

“Assuming he/she has worked up 
a mailing list of about 150 other 
fans and fan publishers, the best 
route is free use of a mimeo or 
Ditto machine. If a good piece of 
art is in hand, have it run off offset 
as a cover. Otherwise do without 
art. Art and layouts and all the 
quasi-professional appearances of 
advanced fan magazines should not 
be attempted at first.” 

Why not? Doesn’t layout and 
artwork improve a fanzine? 

“Sometimes. But at base a fan 
magazine — any magazine — lives or 
dies on the quality of its writing ! A 
successful fan magazine can be pub- 
lished that has no art in it at all, 
ever.” 

“Geis! You expect me to be- 
lieve — 

“Yes. Some of the most expen- 
sive, professionally printed, elabo- 
rately illustrated fan magazines were 
total flops because the text was 
dull, badly written, or ill-chosen.” 

That leads me to the core ques- 
tion, then. How do I get all this 
fine writing I need for my fan 
magazine? 

“You start out by writing it your- 
self, Alter. You’re always bragging 
how good you are. For your first 
issue you make your fanzine a dis- 
play for your writing, your matu- 
rity, your personality. And in that 
first issue you ask for contributions 
of art and writing from the fans 
you’ve sent copies to.” 

Why would they send stuff to 
me? Am I supposed to pay? 

“No, you are not supposed to 



pay until after your magazine makes 
a profit. 99.9999 per cent of fan- 
zines never make a profit. Most 
semi-prozines don’t make a profit. 
Some prozines don’t make a profit. 
Fans write articles and reviews and 
letters to fan magazines so their 
efforts will be published, so they can 
communicate with hundreds of other 
fans. And an artists (even some 
professional artists) will send their 
work to fan magazines so they can 
see their work published, for ego- 
boosting, or status. If you edit and 
publish a highly popular fan 
magazine, the best fan writers and 
artists will want to appear in it.” 

But what if I’m not so hot as a 
fan writer? What if I have a lousy 
personality-on-paper? What if my 
editorial sense is nowhere? 

“Then you will publish what is 
known as a crudzine, and after a 
few issues you will tire of the game 
and seek another hobby where you 
can be a winner.” 

Well, that won’t happen to we! 
I’m going to publish a Hugo- 
winning zine and be awarded the 
Best Fan Writer Hugo, and build up 
the circulation till I have 2,000 sub- 
scriptions and send over a thousand 
copies to be sold in bookstores, and 
make my living off the magazine! 

“Uh-huh. How long you think 
it’ll take you, Alter?” 

Oh ... I figure maybe a year. 

“Pardon me while I stifle my 
laughter. Alter, it takes years and 
years to build up the paying circula- 
tion of even the best of fanzines. 
Unless, of course, you have fifty- 
thousand tdollars you can spare to 
advertise the mag. Or national 
newstand distribution. But that’s 
virtually impossible unless you 



144 



GALAXY 




have the zillions needed to print 
hundred-thousand copy issues for 
six months or so before first returns 
on sales come in. Abandon your 
hopes, Alter; you’re thinking in 
dreams and professional categories. 
Fanzines are not big-money makers, 
if they ever do cross the line to 
marginal profitability. They are 
labors of love, and only a handful 
of fans, in a generation or two, are 
of such peculiar and distinctive 
character/personality/talent as to be 
compelled to even try to publish a 
Big-Time Fanzine.” 

Why are you so determined to 
rain on my parade, Geis? 

‘‘Because you are a fool and full 
of illusions. If you must publish a 
fanzine, start with a personal-zine 
(just you talking to other fans via 
print) and then, if the response is 
favorable, you might want to add 
writing by others, artwork, and ac- 
cept subscriptions.” 

Why wouldn’t 1 want to accept 
subscriptions? 

“Because you are taking on an 
obligation when you contract with 
people to send them a magazine 
every so often for a year or two. 
That’s what a subscription is, you 
know, a contract. And if you start 
out all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed 
and take in a couple hundred subs 
and owe five or six hundred dollars 
in future issues . and then get 
tired of publishing or have to quit 
for one reason or another 
. you’ll have to pay back the 
subscribers . and chances are 99 
to 1 that you’ve spent all that sub- 
scription money on current publish- 
ing expenses.” 

You mean I’d have to pay back 
all that money?

“Huh! You’re a party-pooper,

“Just advising you to look before

Well, okay. So I decide to follow 
your advice and start small ... a 
personal fan magazine, sent free to 
a hundred fans, for trades with their 
fan magazines and for letters-of- 
comment, what’s the best way to 
mail it? I understand the post office 
is a maze of weird rules and regula- 
tions. 

“That it • is. For instance, the 
P.O. says it has five classes of mail: 
First, Second, Third, Fourth and 
Parcel Post. -Actually, there are only 
two classes, airmail and surface. 
First class mail and extra-cost Sec- 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



145 




ond and Parcel Post mail go fast, by 
plane. All the other stuff goes by 
train, truck and bus, and usually 
takes about the same amount of 
time. 

“If you want speed, keep your 
fanzine small — four pages or so — 
under one ounce in weight per 
copy, and mail in First Class. If 
you want more pages per issue, 
third class costs (as of November, 
1977) 140 for 2 ounces, 280 for up 
to four ounces. After that you’re bet- 
ter off having at least 28 printed 
pages, calling your publication a 
book, and mailing at special Fourth 
Class Book rates: 300 for the first 
pound. The larger, thicker fan 
magazine should be mailed in an 
envelope. A small, ten-page zine 
can be folded and stapled shut and 
mailed “naked” provided you have 
left space on the outer page for your 
return address and so on, as on the 
face of an envelope.” 

What about Second Class, Geis? 
I’ve heard magazines get a big 
break in mailing costs with second 
class. 

“Yes, but. You have to have at 
least 200 subscribers, you have to 
have your fanzine printed by offset 
or letterpress, and you have to make 
application to mail at second class, 
and you have to pay a big fee. Last 
I heard it was $30 minimum. And, 
you have to pre-sort and bundle and 
sack your fanzines by zipcode in a 
special way, and make out mailing 
forms each issue ... It gets com- 
plicated. You pay a price for the 
privilege of saving postage money. 
Same way with a Third Class Bulk 
Mailing Permit — all kinds of forms 
and the same complicated pre- 
sorting and bundling requirements. 

146 



A small-circulation fanzine isn’t 
worth the hassle. Stick with First 
Class or single-piece Third Class or 
single-piece Book Rate.” 

Okay, thanks, Geis. You’ve been 
very helpful. One more thing, 
though. How much should I charge 
for my zine? 

“Alter . *Sigh* Assuming 
your first few issues are good and 
you get egoboo and are still willing 
to continue, if you must sell it to a 
few fans who want to receive it, 
you might follow the 4 cents per 
printed page formula: thus eight 
pages of text/art mailed first class is 
fairly worth about 35 cents or three 
issues for $1 . A 30-40 page zine is 
usually priced at $1 to $1.25. More 
pages, more price. Once you get 
deeply into fandom and learn the 
ropes of publishing you can make 
your own estimate of how-much. 
Are you satisfied?” 

Ummm, yea. Thanks. See you 
around the medula. 

“Hey! How about the payoff? 
You primised five minutes of ex- 
quisite pleasure.” 

Oh, yes. Okay ... let me worm

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT

EDITORIAL— 



Who’s Minding The Store? 



“He knows nothing and thinks he 
to a political career.” 



P RESIDENT CARTER COITieS in for 
some hard knocks from Jerry Pour- 
nelle this month, anent the “energy 
program.” And perhaps Jerry will 
come in for some hard knocks from 
Carter partisans and/or anti-nuclear 
people in future Directions columns. 

But this isn’t an editorial about 
hard knocks, deserved or otherwise. 
Rather . it is about how much, in- 
deed, our future is being shaped by 
people who know nothing and think 
they know everything. And they 
aren’t all politicians, by any means. 

The energy crisis? In a recent poll, 
at least half the people refused to 
believe this country imports oil at 
all. While reflex liberals oppose 
both nuclear power and such alter- 
natives as coal and solar power 
satellites, reflex conservatives deny 
there’s any crisis to begin with —

knows everything. That points clearly 
— Undershaft, in Major Barbara 



we’ve never run out of oil before, 
so we never will and the “shor- 
tage” is manufactured by politicans. 

It’s easy to be cynical about 
politicians, and we are all doubtless 
justified in suspecting their motives. 
A lot of them aren’t very bright or 
very honest to begin with; but even 
when they are, they aren’t likely to 
stay that way for long in an atmo- 
sphere of back-room politics and 
lobbying pressures. 

But is this really surprising? Ours 
is supposedly a “democratic” soci- 
ety, but most people have so little 
interest in the political process they 
don’t know who their congressmen 
are. Maybe it’s just as well; with 
high schools graduating illiterates 
by the millions, how could they 
keep well enough informed to take 
a meaningful part in the process 

GALAXY 




anyway? 

Ignorance appears to be rampant 
even among the “educated” — not 
long ago, a journalism professor 
polled his class, and some of the 
students thought David Berkowitz 
was a Supreme Court justice. Well, 
maybe that will give the Son of 
Sam’s lawyers an idea where to 
seek a change of venue, at least. 

GALAXY readers are a cut above 
that level — true. But don’t be so 
smug. How much do you really 
know about the issues involved in 
the debate over recombinant DNA 
research, or nuclear power plants, 
or the B-l bomber vs. the cruise 
missile, or even rival plans for re- 
cycling garbage into fuel, fertilizer 
or building materials? Yet these are 
all issues that affect your lives — 
some of them, at least, are life- 
and-death matters. 

Let’s say you do keep informed, 
and can make intelligent arguments 
about these and other issues. 
When’s the last time you actually 
did so in a way that mattered? The 
world is full of voices, and many of 
them are making themselves heard. 
Is yours one of them? 

We haven’t heard it. We’ve heard 
reactionaries like Phyllis Schlaffly 
and Anita Bryant denouncing the 
ERA and gay rights. We’ve heard 
the oh-so-intellectual terrorists, who 
murder in the name of the People 
they pretend to represent (“Le 
peuple, c’est moi,” seems to be the 
radical aristocrats’ variation on 
Louis XIV). We’ve heard the or- 
ganized lobbies of business, labor, 
farmers, etc. 

They're making themselves 
heard, all right — the crazies, idiots 
and vested interests of left, right 



and center. The last time science 
fiction fans made themselves heard 
was in a campaign to have the first 
space shuttle christened the Enter- 
prise. The last time before that, it 
was in a campaign to save Star 
Trek. The last time before that. 

Well, there were those ads oppos- 
ing groups of writers took out in sf 
magazines in 1968 for and against 
the Vietnam War. Inspiring, but 
hardly original. Some of the same 
writers published Vietnam War 
stories thinly disguised as science 
fiction — the effect of which was no 
doubt negligible, for good or ill. 

Those who try to change things- 
as-they-are receive a lot of discour- 
agement. “Society” is pretty big, 
and individuals don’t seem to count 
for much; even groups of individu- 
als like us don’t seem to count for 
much. Individuals don’t make his- 
tory, we have been told by the likes 
of Lenin — who was able to bring 
off the Bolshevik Revolution only 
by disproving his own theory. 

History is in a state of flux just 
now; instability is rampant in almost 
every social and political institution. 
We are in precisely the kind of time 
where our \vords and actions can 
accomplish something. It is during 
times of stability and unquestioned 
tradition that individuals and small 
groups of’dissidents don’t count. In 
times like ours, those who discour- 
age such efforts may very well be 
the ones who want to keep the 
game of playing with the future to 
themselves. 

Things aren’t just happening out 
there in the nation and the world — 
people are making them happen. 
And if we don’t like the kind of 
things they are making happen, then

we’d better get busy and try to 
make better things happen. 

But we have to think seriously 
and act seriously. If we don’t, we 
aren’t any better than the plastic 
hippies who run off to start rural 
communes without (like the Amish 
or Mennonites) bothering to learn 
anything about farming or the 
amount of labor involved in reject- 
ing expensive and/or sinful technol- 
ogy. 

How many of you out there have 
the skills to not only lobby for but 
actually work on one of Gerard 
O’Neill’s space colonies, for in- 
stance? Because if there’s anything 
you can count on, it’s that people 
with a lot of enthusiasm and no 
skills won’t be any more use at L-5 
than at one of those rural com- 
munes. Nothing is going to be ac- 
complished by, and nobody’s going 
to be impressed by a college drop- 
out in a Star Wars T-shirt. 

In Jerry’s previous column, he 
reported debating people who think 
space industries are “rapped out” 
because none of those who talk 
about space so much would actually 
go there. That attitude may be typi- 
cal. Too many people think space 
and other such frontiers are a lot of 
mickey-mouse, just like science fic- 
tion is a lot of mickey-mouse. 

We know better, or ought to 
know better. We know how serious 
humanity’s problems are — and we 
also know some approaches to solu- 
tions that can work, if only they are 
taken seriously and pursued seri- 
ously. But nobody’s going to take 
us seriously unless we take our- 
selves seriously.

Dear Editor: 

I wish to take issue with both MM. 
Jay Kay Klein and Jeff Rovin. They 
both seem to be under the misapprehen- 
sion that Star Wars is “science fic- 
tion.” It is not. What it really is, is fan- 
tasy expressed in sf terms. Moreover, as 
even a casual once-over of the plot 
Should make clear, it is an heir in direct 
line of such classics of Heroic Fantasy 
as Parzival and The Lord of the Rings. 

As a matter of fact, there are strong 
parallels between Star Wars and 
Parzival (the von Eschenback original, 
not the Wagner opera). Both works fea- 
ture as hero a naive youth reared in a 
remote and desolate place in utter ig- 
norance of his true heritage by a well- 
meaning relative who does not want 
him to share his father’s fate (Parzi- 
val’s father, a Knight, was killed in bat- 
tle before Parzival’s birth). In spite of 
the relative’s efforts, the hero fares 
forth into the world (or universe) in 
search of, and soon finds, glorious ad- 
venture and great danger. He is marked 
out for a high and noble destiny: in Par- 
zival’s case, to find the Holy Grail 
(which was not yet the purely Christian 
symbol that it later became) and to 
restore fertility to the Waste Land; 
while Luke Skywalker is being none too 
subtly directed toward doing the same 
thing on a larger scale. With Star Wars, 
we have barely reached the end of Part 
One (or possibly Two); a good place to 

152 



pause, but the end of the story is not in 
sight. 

There are, in addition, parallels with 
The Lord of the Rings: the story is part 
of the eternal conflict of Good vs. Evil; 
the Evil side is powerful and well- 
organized whereas the Good is rep- 
resented by a handful of oddly-assorted 
characters; the hero’s “impossible mis- 
sion” is to destroy major menace to the 
cause of Good; and in this task he has 
the help of a Wise Old Man. (Tolkien- 
ites who have seen Star Wars, please 
re-read the Moria sequence from the 
Watcher in the Water to the Bridge of 
Khazad-Dun.) 

Incidentally, I would like to quibble 
with M. Klein about the charac- 
terizations. They aren’t, and are not in- 
tended to be, the People Next Door. 
Neither are they “stock cardboard char- 
acters.” They are Archetypes of an un- 
usual degree of purity (that is, freedom 
from confusing “realistic” charac- 
teristics): the Innocent Fool, the Wise 
Old Man, the Anima, the Shadow (in 
fact, several Shadows of more than one 
person), the Helpful Animal and so on. 
Anyone with access to a good collection 
of fairy tales or to Jung’s essays on 
Psyche and Symbol — or to a Tarot 
deck — will recognize most if not all of 
them. 

The spaceships, blasters etc. that give 
Star Wars its illusory appearance of sf 
are the symbols and conventions of our 
time, as horses and swords were of the 
older Heroic Fantasies. Lucas has done 
a brilliant job, thus far, of presenting 
the old essences under new forms; let us 
hope he can keep it up! 

Sincerely yours, 

Bettina Helms

Well, / knew Star Wars fans were 
young in heart — but Jung in heart 
tool — j.j.p ■ 

Gentlemen: 

After having read the reviews of Star 
Wars you printed, I decided I had to 
write. 

Both “authors” assumed that Star 
Wars takes place in our future. If they 
had paid attention when they saw it, 
they would know it takes place “a long 
time ago in a galaxy far, far away.” 

To Jim Baen: 

When the Star Destroyer took the 
princess’ ship aboard, they had no fear 
of it self-destructing. First of all, the 
cruiser is far too large to be badly dam- 
aged by a self-destruct. Considering that 
the inside of the port, like the inside 
of the garbage masher, would have 
magnetic screens, and the port being 
open to space, the force of the explo- 
sion would be channeled away into 
space. Secondly, the princess had, at all 
costs, to get the plans of the Death Star 
to the Rebel Alliance. Self-destruct 
would have made this impossible. 

As to the X and Y-wing fighters not 
being caught in the tractor beam, they 
were too small, too fast and too ma- 
neuverable for the Death Star’s crews to 
touch. Both tractor beam and turbo- 
lasers were for use against larger ships. 
Also, one-man fighters were not consid- 
ered to be a threat, which is why the 
Rebels used them. 

To Jay Kay Klein: 

Parsecs are a measure of distance, not 
time. A parsec is 3.2 light years (Jay 
already knows this ; that was his 
point — ed.). Also, it was 12 parsecs, 
not 15. 

As to the statement about Luke en- 
dangering his mission to rescue the 
princess being childish, 1 have one 



word: ridiculous. Luke’s driving force 
was to leave the dull life of Tatooine 
and fight the Empire in any way, shape 
or form. The robots provided that 
chance. As for rescuing the princess, it 
was only logical. First, he was attracted 
to her. Second, she was the head of the 
Rebel Alliance after the destruction of 
Alderan. Third, to leave her would have 
been a second blow to Rebel morale. 

There was no “instantaneous conver- 
sion to fighter pilot.” In the Rebel 
briefing, Luke said he “used to bullseye 
womp rats” back home in his T-16. 
The T-16 is a skyhopper. Also, he was 
going to submit his application to the 
(pilots’) Academy. He was a pilot, a 
bush pilot. Womp rats were rodent-like 
animals. 

To Jeff Rovin: 

To answer the few pages that you 
wrote would take more pages than this 
magazine has for a while issue. But I’ll 
try in as little space as possible. 

Star Wars is far more realistic than 
Forbidden Planet could ever hope to 
be. 

It is C-3PO, not C-P30 (probably 
a typo at this end — ed.) 

Who or what said the Jedis were 
telekinetic? 

The prologue was quite necessary to 
set the scene. 

There was no sudden change in Han’s 
temperament. This was first seen in a 
conversation with Luke after escaping 
from the Death Star. Also, Chewbacca’s 
behavior when they were loading their 
payment on board ship hinted at Han 
showing up later to help. 

The alien make-up was not uncon- 
vinching. The alien with eyes on the 
T-shaped end; of a trunk-like head prov- 
ed that. Especially when the eyes 
blinked. 

Banthas don’t necessarily show a dis-

regard for biology. Look at the 
shaggy-maned male lion of the hot Af- 
rican veldt, and the heavily-robed 
nomads of the Sahara. 

Several garbage mashers would fit into 
an auditorium. They would be necessary 
if the Death Star could not reorganize 
matter “on a nuclear level." There was 
no evidence in the movie that it could. 

The Galactic Empire ruled with op- 
pressive force and fear, like most mili- 
tary dictatorships. The “brusque joyless 
manner of Death Star personnel” and 
so-called “surrogate Nazis” is rather 
obvious viewed in this light. 

I’ve been reading science fiction all 
my life and I, unfortunately, also re- 
member all the stupidities (like the con- 
tinually recurring same piece of land- 
scape in Flash Gordon) of old sf 
movies. Star Wars shows thought and 
originality.

Now if only somebody would go to this 
much trouble to analyze the stories in 
GALAXY! —j-j-P- 

Dear Editor: 

After turning a thousand shades of 
crimson, banging my fist on the desk, 
walking around my chair fifty times, 
patting my wookie poster and then sit- 
ting down to let the strains of the Star 
Wars Theme (Disco Version) soothe my 
shattered nerves, 1 tried to come to 
grips with how a seemingly rational and 
literate individual like Jeff Rovin could 
say such terrible things about our 
newest National Shrine. 

As I write this, two students pass my 
office. The one clutching his Star Wars 
notebook and his Star Wars paperback 
to his Star Wars T-shirt with his star 

154 



worn expression is explaining the tre- 
mendous theological statement inherent 
in the substructure of the cinematic ex- 
perience they had just shared for the 
fifteenth time. The other says as they 
pass: “Then if Luke is actually Christ, 
then that makes Obi-Wan 
Kenobi ” 

It strikes me like a laserblast. Both 
Rovin and these students share a com- 
mon delusion — they see not what is 
there but what they want to see there. 
The glassy-eyed zealots love Star Wars 
because they see it as some kind of 
life-changing mystical experience with 
deep religious overtones. Jeff Rovin dis- 
likes Star Wars because it is not the pic- 
ture he wanted to be and also be- 
cause he encountered some post- 
Wizardian Nazi hang-up that obscured 
his vision. In both cases the individuals 
reacted so strongly on a personal level 
that they lost all aesthetic distance from 
the work. 

Rovin’s chief fault is that he is using 
the wrong critical tool to conduct his 
examination. He is condemning Star 
Wars because it is not a film when, in 
actuality, its sole intent was to be an ex- 
tremely entertaining movie. Which it 
most certainly is.- He doesn’t realize that 
a viewer consciously brings a different 
set of expectations to each type of 
cinematic event-flicks, movies and 
films. 

The other day I mentioned to my 
class that Nem>ork was playing at the 
University Theatre. One student im- 
mediately blurted: “I .hated that 

movie!” “Ah ha!” says I. “That’s be- 
cause it’s not a movie, it’s a film.” 
For the next ten minutes I took off on a 
tirade, explaining why films by such di- 
rectors as Bergman, Kubrick, Truffaut 
and Lumet demand more active partici- 
pation by the viewer and more apprecia- 

GALAXY 




tion of the total experience and pervad- 
ing expression of the director. I asked 
the student to see it again and then tell 
me what he thought about it in light of 
this new information. He did. He still 
hated it. But this time he knew why he 
felt as he did. He had been in the mood 
for a little light entertainment and his 
initial negative reaction to the film 
clouded his subsequent viewing of it. 
We have all experienced this feeling of 
being turned off by something we see 
yet not being able to precisely express 
why. 1 feel this way about Annie Hall . 
In a reverse way, Rovin will never be 
able to appreciate Star Wars for what it 
is. 

Reviewers review movies seen in a 
theatre. Critics critique films seen in a 
cinema. You can’t mix the two without 
getting an upset stomach. Even though 
Mr. Rovin bemoans the success of 
cliches, the proof is in the pudding. 
Star Wars will soon become the all-time 
box office giant because the majority of 
viewers are able to appreciate an unpre- 
tentious movie for what it is.

Well, that’s progress for you! Took 
40 years to get college professors talk- 
ing abouf written science fiction, but 
only a few months for one to sound 
forth on an sf movie. — j . j . p. 

Dear Editor: 

I feel compelled to comment on Mr. 
Rovin’s negative review of Star Wars. I 
have met a few other strange creatures 
who didn't like the movie, and 1 can 
only believe that they are simply mis- 
sing the point of it, as I almost did. 



When I saw the first ads for Star 
Wars, I assumed it was an ultra; 
schlocky film with science fiction pre- 
tensions, something that would make 
Soylent Green look profound and artis- 
tic. My fiance insisted I would like it, 
so 1 gritted my teeth and prepared to 
tolerate it. Within ten minutes, I re- 
alised my mistake. Star Was is not sci- 
ence fiction, and should not be judged 
as such. Perhaps the best category for it 
is space fantasy. 

I will grant that there were some 
technical inconsistencies, and cardboard 
characterisations. I also feel someone 
did a terrible injustice to Princess Leia, 
really a rather pretty girl, when they 
gave her that horrible hairstyle. The 
special effects impressed me with their 
detail and realism, and somehow, I mis- 
sed the flaws Mr. Rovin objects to, I 
thought the aliens’ make-up was superb. 

But none of that has to do with the 
point of the movie. All right, so the 
movie is The Wizard of Oz, The Three 
Musketeers, Z.orro and a bunch of other 
legends, set in outer space. What’s 
wrong with that? It is the everlasting 
adventure/romance that never dies. The 
Hero is handsome, brave, a little inno- 
cent, a little mischievous. The Heroine 
is feminine and spunky. The Old Man 
is very old an’d very wise and noble. 
The Villain is thoroughly evil. 

It is the mood of Star Wars that is its 
magic. It speaks of growing up, of the 
humour of the human condition, and of 
the beauty and value of life. It shows 
people acting instead of sitting and 
whining, people trying against impossi- 
ble odds, and succeeding. It is 
straightforward, and uncluttered by 
sophistication. It’s overall tone is of en- 
joyment and hope. 

Arguing about technical flaws in 
“Star Was” is like arguing that Shake- 



DIRECTIONS 



155 




speare stole from Bacon. Who cares, 
if the final effect is good? I’ve had 
enough of movies that leave me feeling 
exhausted, frustrated, angry, betrayed, 
and only briefly safe from the inevitable 
doom of the modern world. When I 
walked out of “Star Wars”, I felt good , 
clear down to my toenails. 

The current drive for artistic “re- 
alism” is too often laced with cynicism 
and snobbery. In their efforts to be ur- 
bane, “modern” people too often con- 
descendingly brush off simple pleasure 
and idealism as naive and immature. 
But to be mature means not having to 
constantly prove it, and the human 
psyche needs those innocent, starry- 
eyed feelings as well as “realism” to 
be balanced and healthy. 

If you want to pick “star Wars” 
apart, go ahead. 1 feel sorry for you. 
I’m going to see it again tonight, and 
Im going to have a terrific time! 

May the Force be with you.

Dear Mr. Rovin: 

1 am 100 percent behind you in the 
CON section of STAR WARS — PRO 
AND CON in the October edition of 
GALAXY. Harlan Ellison, in a recent 
interview, called Star Wars “mind- 
less.” If this trash is the best that mo- 
tion picture producers can come up with 
(it isn’t , but that’s beside the point), 
then science fiction in the cinema must 
be going downhill. 

How can anybody compare this sick- 
ening, trashy motion picture to 2001: A 
Space Odyssey ? 1, too, am revolted by 
people who call Star Wars the greatest 
science fiction film ever made. How 

156 



can anyone call himself an sf fan if he 
was not disgusted by Star Wars? ! hope 
it will be a long time before we see any 
science fiction film as stupid as Star 
Wars.

Well. I hope you’ve brightened Jeffs 
day a little, after all those other letters.

about Close Encounters now. -j-j-P- 

Dear Jim: 

Just finished reading your rectenna/

response. 

My comment is that sodomy can be 
habit-forming. 

Leaving aside anti-miscegenistic prej- 
udices (after all, mules ....), I would 
worry only about radiation pressure 
from the microwaves. Those energy- 
carrying photons have some momentum, 
and your ion-drives will be absorbing a 
lot of photons. That is my only reserva- 
tion. 

On rectennae: J.P. worries about cur- 
rent load-carrying ability and conductor 
mass. Superconductors would be a way 
out, and organic room-temperature 
superconductors exist (something like 
one very long communal conjugate 
bond), but I don’t know what the 
current-carrying capacities of organic 
superconductors are. 

You have done a superb job, Jim, 
editing GALAXY. 1 will miss your 
touch. My best wishes. I anticipate your 
work (at Ace) with pleasure (I won’t 
wish you “luck" because I believe that 
you make your own — and you seem to 
make lots of the good kind.).

All, a non- Star Wars letter — maybe 
Jerry can develop this idea further in 
another column. I’m so far behind I 
hadn't even realized there were organic 
superconductors available. -j-j-P- 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

Your August Editorial really hit 
home. Hopefully it will stimulate others 
as it has stimulated me. I’ve been mean- 
ing to write a good SF story for years, 
now. One reason I’ve never done so 
(besides procrastination and sloth) is be- 
cause 1 can never make up my mind 
about how much to leave out or include 
in the background. The more 1 think 
about the ramifications of events and 
ideas completely unrelated to the ele- 
ments of the story at hand, the less in- 
clined I am to actually finish the 
damned thing (usually I rewrite it to 
death as new — and better — ideas pop 
into my head). 

The obvious solution to this problem 
is to do what Heinlein and Asimov did: 
sit down and create, with as much detail 
as possible, a complete and comprehen- 
sive "future history” which carries the 
cause and effect of advancing technol- 
ogy, plausible politics, and good of 
human nature (modified artificially, 
sooner or later) as far into the future as 
you can. 1 did this recently, with sur- 
prising results. 

I wanted to write a series of stories 
about the colonization of space, out to 
and including generation-type starships, 
based on what I considered the “most 
probable” future. 1 started with the 
Shuttle, the Third Industrial Revolution, 
and . and ran up against my first big 
problem. It really will be a revolution, 
and the society our grandchildren take 
for granted will be as alien to us as ours 
would be to Julius Caesar. Brain/ 
computer interfacing; literally unlimited 



energy and natural resources; and by the 
end of the 21st Century I ran out of 
steam: I had let technology advance to 
the point where almost everything we 
could learn about the Universe had been 
learned and the resulting goods and ser- 
vices became “indistinguishable from 
magic.” Even if we do not make a 
breakthrough that results in some sort of 
FTL Drive, we will have intelligent 
robots to do our work for us and total 
conversion of matter/energy to provide 
us all with an incredibly high standard 
of living, not to mention some form of 
immortality, artificial telepathy, an end 
to the root causes of crime and war and 
poverty and conflict and mental illness 
and . Hm-m-m . this is what 
could conceivably happen by the end of 
the next century! What are our descen- 
dants of ten thousand years from now 
going to be doing to avert boredom? 

It gets worse. The story 1 write today 
will be obsolete before it is published 
because some scientist made a new dis- 
covery out on the frontier of knowl- 
edge. I’m afraid to write a story set on 
the moons of Saturn because the Voy- 
ager probes will certainly change our 
concepts of what the Saturn system 
looks like . Worse still, each story 
has a way of writing itself, with results 
that do not fit neatly into the precon- 
ceived future history. Asimov had to 
re-read each earlier story when he added 
a new episode to his Foundation future, 
and the inevitable contradictions still 
crept in. The logical consequence is to 
avoid trying to work out a comprehen- 
sive future history for an interrelated set 
of stories, like Heinlein’s. The writer is 
thus faced with the prospect of creating 
a new future history, based on the latest 
technology and science, for each indi- 
vidual story! i would gladly do this, for 
the sake of realism if nothing else, but

would spend so much time reading the 
latest technical journals and creating be- 
lievable future histories that 1 would 
never have time to actually write a 
story. And that is why 1 am not a Big 
Name Writer. And that is part of the rea- 
son, I suspect, why most of the people 
who read your magazine are not writers 
either. 

But, I’m working out a solution to 
these problems. My first story will be 
set in the very near future. Each story 
thereafter will be set in the future that 
will logically result from each previous 
story. 1 hope to be writing stories set in 
the year 2000 well before I retire in the 
year 2012 .. 

Yours for a better future,

Dear Editor, 

I am writing in response to Mr. Jac- 
kowski’s letter published in your Au- 
gust, 1977 issue. He is most accurate id 
his documentation of God’s greatest 
commandments. However, he forgets 
that God said, “To break one of my 
commandments is to break them all.” 
Ergo, each one depends on the other. It 
must be realized that we must follow 
Genesis 1:28 before we can follow 
Matthew 22:36-40, and Mark 12:28- 
31. The reasoning behind this is evi- 
dent; however, for those of you who do 
not see the point — If man does not mul- 
tiply the species will die and there will 
be no one left to worship, there will be 
no more transactions between men. 

As long as I’m on the subject I think 
I’ll take time out to explain the reason 
for the “Golden Rule”. In the begin- 
ning there was God, he was all. There- 
fore, it is logical that anything formed 
must consist of his substance. This is in 



accordance with the theory that matter 
can be converted to energy and vice 
versa, (without the destruction of either 
forms) Thus, we are all, each and every 
one of us, components of the same be- 
ing. the same substance, God. It makes 
sense, then, that we should treat each 
other as we would like to be treated. 
We are all bonded together, all part of 
the same being, and any action that 
harms another also harms us, in one 
way or another. 

And since God is all, all is God, it 
only makes sense that he be om- 
nibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipo- 
tent. It’s not that difficult a problem. 
Hear that, Mr. Heinlein? Perhaps you 
should tell Lazarus Long to call off his 
bets. 

Mr. Baen, 1 salute you for allowing 
Biblical debates in your magazine. It is 
something long overdue in Science Fic- 
tion, for there is no other book with 
such a close connection to science and 
man’s behavior. Thank you.

How The 

Science Fiction Book Club Works: 

When your application for membership is accepted, 
you’ll receive your introductory package of four books 
for just 100 , plus shipping and handling. You may 
examine them in your home, and if not completely 
satisfied, return them within ten days — membership 
will be cancelled and you’ll owe nothing. 

About every 4 weeks (14 times a year), we'll send 
you the Club’s bulletin. Things to Come, describing 
the 2 coming Selections and a variety of Alternate 
choices. If you want both Selections, you need do 
nothing; they’ll be shipped automatically. 

If you don’t want a Selection, or prefer an 
Alternate, or no book at all, just fill out the convenient 
form always provided, and return it to us by the date 
specified. 

We try to allow you at least ten days for making 
your decision. If you do not receive the form in time to 
respond within 10 days, and receive an unwanted 
Selection, you may return it at our expense. 

As a member you need take only 4 Selections or 
Alternates during the coming year. You may resign, any 
time thereafter, or remain a member as long as you 
wish. At least one of the two Selections each month is 
only $1.98 plus shipping and handling. Other extra- 
value Selections are slightly higher but always much 
less than Publishers’ Editions. Send no money. Fold 
ad, postage paid side out. Fasten and mail.
