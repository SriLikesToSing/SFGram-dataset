THE DOOR'S STILL OPEN 



In expanding to the giant 196-page size, we decided first to honor all 
our subscriptions at the old rate of $3.50 for 12 issues, despite the increase 
in cost. Then we concluded that this would frustrate readers who also wished 
to get in on a good thing, and we invited them to subscribe at the old rate, 
and limited the offer to 30 days. Now. however, we find that we have 
attracted new readers who resent being discriminated against. To give every- 
one an absolutely final fair chance, here is your savings coupon. Use it to 
buy a new subscription, to extend an old one, to give as gifts. And do it 
now — big, generous bargain will not be repeated, no matter who howls !

WHAT'LL IT BE? 



TTERE in your hands is the first 
issue of the giant new 196- 
page Galaxy. 

Well, thanks, but we’d much 
rather view it as just what it is— 
one arbitrary solution out of a 
good many possibles. 

What are the alternatives? Look 
at it this way. Having 196 pages 
to move around in is like your 
home suddenly becoming 50% 
bigger — along with half again as 
much money to make it what you 
want it to be. Translate magazine 
divisions into household terms and 
the choices are nearly identical: 
all bedrooms; or one extra bed- 
room, another bathroom and a 
den; or a spare living room and a 
pantry; or enlarge all the rooms 
you now have, or break down the 
walls and redesign the whole 
house? 

We are prepared to do any of 
that to make Galaxy exactly what 
you want it to be, just as we did 
back in 1950. We asked then for 
this sort of advice, and our read- 
ers told us, and the advice made 
Galaxy the most widely read sci- 
ence fiction magazine in the world. 
If that sounds mystical, it’s the 
reverse that really is — editors can 
only make more or less shrewd div- 
inations, whereas readers know 
what they want.

But it is nearly a decade since 
we invited votes. That’s long 
enough for any number of new 
factors to enter: tastes change; 
what once was fresh and daring 
may now be too familiar; and, 
most important of all, turnover of 
readership — a point we’ll get to 
in a moment — means that many 
readers never had a say. 

For those who missed or mislaid 
it, we’ll list again the points up for 
referendum : 

• To begin with, the heart of the 
magazine — stories. With all these 
added pages, we could pull a too 
prevalent flimflam: bloating up an 
artificial table of contents by run- 
ning lots of very little stories and 
buckshot filler— but with 196 pages 
to do it in, our table of contents 
would be several times longer than 
most of the runty items listed. 

That policy makes sense only if 
readers prefer batches of squibs to 
fewer but much heftier stories. 
Well, do you? 

This issue, for example, holds 
down the short stories for the sake 
of a pair of tall novelets and a 
really wide-shouldered novella. If 
that’s overstressing long stories, 
in your opinion, there could have 
been, say, three or four novelets 
and at least as many short stories.

Or should it be still fewer long 
lengths and more shorts? The com- 
binations are no problem. The 
only question is which lengths you 
like most 

• How about serials? The best 
solution — running them complete 
— can’t be done; they’d squeeze 
out everything else. Worse yet, 
that would also kill book, paper- 
bound reprint and club sales for 
the authors — book publishers 
won’t touch novels that have ap- 
peared uncut in single issues. With 
196 pages, we can run them in two 
equal installments and have plenty 
of room for other material. There’s 
a two-month wait, true, but isn’t 
that better than three or four 
monthly installments? Before you 
decide, think if you’d have been 
willing to miss reading The De- 
molished Man, Gravy Planet, The 
Puppet Masters, The Stars My 
Destination — and now Time Killer. 

It’s a tough decision. That’s why 
we ask you to help make it. 

• What do you think of articles? 
Is our science department a good 
solution? If so, why — and how 
can it be made better? If not, what 
would you prefer? 

• Do you like our editor’s page? 
Should it be lighter? Heavier? Not 
at all? 

• Readers voted against a letter 
column back in 1950, a big sur- 
prise because we like them in 
newspapers and magazines, and 



had planned to have one. Is it that 
readers feared a letter column 
must be juvenile or pedantic? It 
needn’t be, if it’s shut down when 
no interesting mail comes in. 
Whafs your vote now, eight years 
later? 

• How about our book reviews? 

• Any thoughts on our cover 
and inside art, layouts, typog- 
raphy? 

• In short, if you had a magazine 
of your own, what would it be 
like? Tell us and we’ll do our 
honest best to make Galaxy as 
close as possible to your idea of an 
ideal magazine. 

'T'HOSE are the questions we 
asked in the Nov. 1950 and 
Dec. 1958 issues. Now the turn- 
over of readership mentioned be- 
fore: 

All surveys show that all maga- 
zines have an all but complete 
change of audience every five 
years. We have constant evidence 
of that in the letters piteously beg- 
ging us to reprint early Galaxy 
stories. We’ve resisted. But those 
fine tales are not to be found any- 
where any more. If we ran just 
one per issue, wouldn’t it be at 
little cost to the elite minority 
that owns files? 

On all these matters, your 
opinion counts. Your suggestions 
will be followed. Galaxy really 
is your magazine.

T HE mishap came at dusk, 
as the last floater was 
settling down above the 
cargo dump, the eight small motors 
flickering bluely in the twilight. 

One instant it was floating level, 
a thousand feet above the ground, 
descending gently, with its cargo 
stacked upon it and the riding 
robots perched atop the cargo. The 
next instant it tilted as first one 
motor failed and then a second 
one. The load of cargo spilled and 
the riding robots with it. The 
floater, unbalanced, became a 
screaming wheel, spinning crazily, 
that whipped in a tightening, rag- 
ing spiral down upon the base.

Steve Sheridan tumbled from 
the pile of crates stacked outside 
his tent. A hundred yards away, 
the cargo hit with a thundering 
crash that could be heard and 
felt above the screaming of the 
floater. The crates and boxes came 
apart and the crushed and twisted 
merchandise spread into a broken 
mound. 

Sheridan dived for the open 
tent flaps and, as he did, the floater 
hit, slicing into the radio shack, 
which had been set up less than 
an hour before. It tore a massive 
hole into the ground, half burying 
itself, throwing up a barrage of 
sand and gravel that bulleted 
across the area, drumming like a 
storm of sleet against the tent. 

A pebble grazed Sheridan’s fore- 
head and he felt the blast of sand 
against his cheek. Then he was 
inside the tent and scrambling for 
the transmog chest that stood be- 
side the desk. 

“Hezekiah!” he bawled. “Heze- 
kiah, where are you!” 

He fumbled his ring of keys and 
found the right one and got it in 
the lock. He twisted and the lid of 
the chest snapped open. 

Outside, he could hear the 
pounding of running robot feet. 

He thrust back the cover of the 
chest and began lifting out the 
compartments in which the tran- 
smogs were racked. 

“Hezekiah!” he shouted. 

For Hezekiah was the one who 



knew where all the transmogs 
were; he could lay his hands upon 
any one of them that might be 
needed without having to hunt for 
it. 

T3EHIND Sheridan, the canvas 
rustled and Hezekiah came 
in with a rush. He brushed Sheri- 
dan to one side. 

“Here, let me, sir,” he said. 
“We’ll need some roboticists,” 
said Sheridan. “Those boys must 
be smashed up fairly bad.” 

“Here they are. You better 
handle them, sir. You do it better 
than any one of us.” 

Sheridan took the three tran- 
smogs and dropped them in the 
pocket of his jacket. 

“I’m sorry there are no more, 
sir,” Hezekiah said. “That is all 
we have.” 

“These will have to do,” said 
Sheridan. “How about the radio 
shack? Was anyone in there?” 

“I understand that it was quite 
empty. Silas had just stepped out 
of it. He was very lucky, sir” 
“Yes, indeed,” agreed Sheridan. 
He ducked out of the tent and 
ran toward the mound of broken 
crates and boxes. Robots were 
swarming over it, digging fran- 
tically. As he ran, he saw them 
stoop and lift free a mass of 
tangled metal. They hauled it from 
the pile and carried it out and laid 
it on the ground and stood there 
looking at it.

GALAXY 




Sheridan came up to the group 
that stood around the mass of 
metal. 

“Abe,” he panted, “did you get 
out both of them?” 

Abraham turned around. “Not 
yet, Steve. Max is still in there.” 
Sheridan pushed his way through 
the crowd and dropped on his 
knees beside the mangled robot 
The midsection, he saw, was so 
deeply dented that the front al- 
most touched the back. The legs 
were limp and the arms were 
canted and locked at a crazy 
angle. The head was twisted and 
the crystal eyes were vacant. 

“Lem,” he whispered. “Lemuel, 
can you hear me?” 

“No, he can’t,” said Abraham. 
“He’s really busted up.” 

“I have roboticists in my pock- 
et.” Sheridan got to his feet. 
“Three of them. Who wants a go 
at it? It’ll have to be fast work.” 
“Count me in,” Abraham said, 
“and Ebenezer there and . 

“Me, too,” volunteered Joshua. 
“We’ll need tools,” said Abra- 
ham. “We can’t do a thing unless 
we have some tools.” 

“Here are the tools,” Hezekiah 
called out, coming on the trot. “I 
knew you would need them.” 
“And light,” said Joshua. “It’s 
getting pretty dark, and from the 
looks of it, we’ll be tinkering with 
his brain.” 

"We’ll have to get him up some- 
place,” declared Abraham, “so we 



can work on him. We can’t with 
him lying on the ground.” 

“You can use the conference 
table,” Sheridan suggested. 

“Hey, some of you guys,” yelled 
Abraham, “get Lem over there on 
the conference table.” 

“We’re digging here for Max,” 
Gideon yelled back. “Do it your- 
self” 

“We can’t,” bawled Abraham. 
“Steve is fixing to get our tran- 
smogs changed . .” 

“Sit down,” ordered Sheridan. 
“I can’t reach you standing up. 
And has someone got a light?” 

“I have one, sir,” said Hezekiah, 
at his elbow. He held out a flash. 

“Turn it on those guys so I can 
get the transmogs in,” 

T^HREE robots came stamping 
-*• over and picked up the dam- 
aged Lemuel. They lugged him 
off toward the conference table. 

In the light of the flash, Sheri- 
dan got out his keys, shuffled 
swiftly through them and found 
the one he wanted. 

“Hold that light steady. I can’t 
do this in the dark.” 

“Once you did,” said Ebenezer. 
“Don’t you remember, Steve? Out 
on Galanova. Except you couldn’t 
see the labels and you got a mis- 
sionary one into Ulysses when you 
thought you had a woodsman and 
he started preaching. Boy, was that 
a night!” 

“Shut up,” said Sheridan, “and 



NSTALLMENT PLAN

hold still. How do you expect me 
to get these into you if you keep 
wiggling?” 

He opened the almost invisible 
plate in the back of Ebenezer’s 
skull and slid it quickly down, 
reached inside and found the 
spacehand transmog. With a quick 
twist, he jerked it out and dropped 
it in his pocket, then popped in the 
roboticist transmog, clicked it into 
place and drove it home. Then he 
shoved up the brain plate and 
heard it lock with a tiny click. 

Swiftly he moved along. He had 
switched the transmogs in the 
other two almost as soon as Ebene- 
zer had regained his feet and 
picked up the kit of tools. 

“Come on, men,” said Ebenezer. 
“We have work to do on Lem” 

The three went striding off. 

Sheridan looked around. Heze- 
kiah and his light had disappeared, 
galloping off somewhere, more 
than likely, to see to something 
else. 

The robots still were digging 
into the heap of merchandise. He 
ran around the pile to help them. 
He began pulling stuff from the 
pile and throwing it aside. 

Beside him, Gideon asked: 
“What did you run into, Steve?” 

“Huh?” 

“Your face is bloody.” 

Sheridan put up his hand. His 
face was wet and sticky. “A piece 
of gravel must have hit me.” 

“Better have Hezekiah fix it.” 



“After Max is out,” said Sheri- 
dan, going back to work. 

They found Maximilian fifteen 
minutes later, at the bottom of the 
heap. His body was a total wreck, 
but he still could talk. 

“It sure took you guys long 
enough,” he said. 

“Ah, dry up,” Reuben said. “I 
think you engineered this so you 
could get a new body.” 

They hauled him out and skid- 
ded him along the ground. Bits of 
broken arms and legs kept drop- 
ping off him. They plunked him 
on the ground and ran toward the 
radio shack. 

Maximilian squalled after them : 
“Hey, come back! You can’t just 
dump me here!” 

^HERIDAN squatted down be- 
^ side him. “Take it easy, Max. 
The floater hit the radio shack 
and there’s trouble over there,” 
“Lemuel? How is Lemuel?” 
“Not too good. The boys are 
working on him.” 

“I don’t know what happened, 
Steve. We were going all right and 
all at once the floater bucked us 
off.” 

“Two of the motors failed,” said 
Sheridan. “Just why, we’ll prob- 
ably never know, now that the 
floater’s smashed. You sure you 
feel all right?” 

“Positive. But don’t let the fel- 
lows fool around. It would be just 
like them to hold out on a body. 



12 



GALAXY 




Just for laughs. Don’t let them.” 
“You’ll have one as soon as we 
can manage. I imagine Hezekiah 
is out running down spare bodies.” 
“It does beat all,” said Maxi- 
milian. “Here we had all the cargo 
down — a billion dollars’ worth of 
cargo and we hadn’t broken—” 
“That’s the way it is, Max. You 
can’t beat the averages.” 

Maximilian chuckled. “You hu- 
man guys” he said. “You always 
figure averages and have hunches 
and . .” 

Gideon came running out of the 
darkness. “Steve, we got to get 
those floater motors stopped. 
They’re running wild. One of them 
might blow.” 

“But I thought you fellows—” 
“Steve, it’s more than a space- 
hand job. It needs a nuclear 
technician.” 

“Come with me.” 

“Hey!” yelled Maximilian. 

“I’ll be back,” said Sheridan. 

At the tent, there was no sign 
of Hezekiah. Sheridan dug wildly 
through the transmog chest. He 
finally located a nuclear tech- 
nician transmog. 

“I guess you’re elected,” he said 
to Gideon. 

“Okay,” the robot said. “But 
make it fast. One of those motors 
can blow and soak the entire area 
with radiation. It wouldn’t bother 
us much, but it would be tough 
on you.” 

Sheridan clicked out the space- 



hand transmog, shoved the other 
in. 

“Be seeing you,” said Gideon, 
dashing from the tent. 

Sheridan stood staring at the 
scattered transmogs. 

Hezekiah will give me hell, he 
thought. 

‘JV'APOLEON walked into the 
^ tent. He had his white apron 
tucked into the belt. His white 
cook’s hat was canted on his head. 

“Steve,” he asked, “how would 
you like a cold supper for to- 
night?” 

“I guess it would be all right.” 
“That floater didn’t only hit the 
shack. It also flattened the stove.” 
“A cold supper is fine. Will you 
do something for me?” 

“What is it?” 

“Max is out there, scared and 
busted up and lonely. He’ll feel 
better in the tent.” 

Napoleon went out, grumbling: 
“Me, a chef, lugging a guy . 

Sheridan began picking up the 
transmogs, trying to get them 
racked back in order once again. 

Hezekiah returned. He helped 
pick up the transmogs, began re- 
arranging them. 

“Lemuel will be all right, sir,” 
he assured Sheridan. “His nervous 
system was all tangled up and 
short-circuiting. They had to cut 
out great hunks of wiring. About 
all they have at the moment, sir, 
is a naked brain. It will take a 



NSTALLMENT PLAN

while to get him back into a body 
and all hooked up correctly.* 

“We came out lucky, Hezekiah ” 

“I suppose you are right, sir. I 
imagine Napoleon told you about 
the stove ” 

Napoleon came in, dragging the 
wreckage that was Maximilian, 
and propped it against the desk. 

“Anything else?” he asked with 
withering sarcasm. 

“No, thank you, Nappy. That is 
all.” 

“Well,” demanded Maximilian, 
“how about my body?” 

“It will take a while,” Sheridan 
told him. “The boys have their 
hands full with Lemuel. But he’s 
going to be all right.” 

“That’s fine,” said Maximilian. 
“Lem is a damn good robot. It 
would be a shame to lose him.” 

“We don’t lose many of you,” 
Sheridan observed. 

“No,” said Maximilian. “We’re 
plenty tough. It takes a lot to 
destroy us.” 

“Sir,” Hezekiah said, “you seem 
to be somewhat injured. Perhaps 
I should call in someone and put 
a medic transmog in him . 

“It’s all right,” said Sheridan. 
“Just a scratch. If you could find 
some water, so I could wash my 
face?” 

“Certainly, sir. If it is only mi- 
nor damage, perhaps I can patch 
you up.” 

He went to find the water. 

“That Hezekiah is a good guy, 



too,” said Maximilian, in an ex- 
pansive mood. “Some of the boys 
think at times that he’s a sort of 
sissy, but he comes through in an 
emergency.” 

“I couldn’t get along without 
Hezekiah,” Sheridan answered 
evenly. "We humans aren’t rough 
and tough like you. We need some- 
one to look after us. Hezekiah’s 
job is in the very best tradition.” 
“Well, what’s eating you?” 
asked Maximilian. “I said he was 
a good guy.” 

TJ EZEKIAH came back with a 
can of water and a towel. 
“Here’s the water, sir. Gideon said 
to tell you the motors are okay. 
They have them all shut off.” 

“I guess that just about buttons 
it all up — if they’re sure of Le- 
muel,” Sheridan said. 

“Sir, they seemed very sure.” 
“Well, fine,” said Maximilian, 
with robotic confidence. “Tomor- 
row morning we can start on the 
selling job.” 

“I imagine so,” Sheridan said, 
standing over the can of water and 
taking off his jacket. 

“This will be an easy one. We’ll 
be all cleaned up and out of here 
in ninety days or less.” 

Sheridan shook his head. “No, 
Max. There’s no such thing as an 
easy one.” 

He bent above the can and 
sloshed water on his face and 
head.

GALAXY 




And that was true, he insisted 
to himself. An alien planet was an 
alien planet, no matter how you 
approached it. No matter how 
thorough the preliminary survey, 
no matter how astute the planning, 
there still would always be that 
lurking factor one could not fore- 
see. 

Maybe if a crew could stick to 
just one sort of job, he thought, 
it eventually might be possible to 
work out what amounted to a fool- 
proof routine. But that was not the 
way it went when one worked for 
Central Trading. 

Central Trading’s interests ran 
to many different things. Garson 
IV was sales. Next time it could 
just as well be a diplomatic mis- 
sion or a health-engineering job. 
A man never knew what he and 
his crew of robots might be in for 
until he was handed his assign- 
ment. 

He reached for the towel. 

“You remember Carver VTI?” 
he asked Maximilian. 

“Sure, Steve. But that was just 
hard luck. It wasn’t Ebenezer’s 
fault he made that small mistake.” 

“Moving the wrong mountain is 
not a small mistake,” Sheridan 
observed with pointed patience. 

“That one goes right back to 
Central,” Maximilian declared, 
with a show of outrage. “They had 
the blueprints labeled wrong . 

“Now let’s hold it down,” Sheri- 
dan advised. “It is past and done 
I NSTALLMENT PLAN 



with. There’s no sense in getting 
all riled up.” 

“Maybe so,” said Maximilian, 
“but it burns me. Here we go and 
make ourselves a record no other 
team can touch. Then Central 
pulls this boner and pins the blame 
on us. I tell you, Central’s got too 
big and clumsy.” 

And smug as well, thought Sher- 
idan, but he didn’t say it. 

rpOO big and too complacent in 
a lot of ways. Take this very 
planet, for example. Central should 
have sent a trading team out here 
many years ago, but instead had 
fumed and fussed around, had con- 
nived and schemed; they had ap- 
pointed committees to delve into 
the situation and there had been 
occasional mention of it at the 
meetings of the board, but there 
had been nothing done until the 
matter had ground its way through 
the full and awesome maze of very 
proper channels. 

A little competition, Sheridan 
told himself, was the very thing 
that Central needed most. Maybe, 
if there were another outfit out to 
get the business, Central Trading 
might finally rouse itself off its 
big, fat dignity, he was thinking 
when Napoleon came clumping in 
and banged a plate and glass and 
bottle down upon the table. The 
plate was piled with cold cuts and 
sliced vegetables; the bottle con- 
tained beer. 



15 




Sheridan looked surprised. “I 
didn’t know we had beer.” 

“Neither did I,” said Napoleon, 
“but I looked and there it was. 
Steve, it’s getting so you never 
know what is going on ” 

Sheridan tossed away the towel 
and sat down at the desk. He 
poured a glass of beer. 

*Td offer you some of this,” he 
told Maximilian, “except I know 
it would rust your guts.” 

Napoleon guffawed. 

“Right as of this moment,” Max- 
imilian said, “I haven’t any guts 
to speak of. Most of them’s 
dropped out.” 

Abraham came tramping briskly 
in. “I hear you have Max hidden 
out some place.” 

“Right here, Abe,” called Max- 
imilian eagerly. 

“You certainly are a mess,” said 
Abraham. “Here we were going 
fine until you two clowns gummed 
up the works.” 

“How is Lemuel?” asked Sheri- 
dan. 

“He’s all right,” said Abraham. 
“The other two are working on 
him and they don’t really need me. 
So I came hunting Max.” He said 
to Napoleon, “Here, grab hold and 
help me get him to the table. We 
have good light out there.” 

Grumbling, Napoleon lent a 
hand. “I’ve lugged him around half 
the night,” he complained. “Let’s 
not bother with him. Let’s just 
toss him on the scrap heap ” 



“It would serve him right,” 
Abraham agreed, with pretended 
wrath. 

The two went out, carrying 
Maximilian between them. He still 
was dropping parts. 

TTEZEKIAH finished with the 
transmog chest, arranging all 
the transmogs neatly in their place. 
He closed the lid with some satis- 
faction. 

“Now that we’re alone,” he said, 
“let me see your face.” 

Sheridan grunted at him through 
a mouth stuffed full of food. 

Hezekiah looked him over. “Just 
a scratch on the forehead, but the 
left side of your face, sir, looks as 
if someone had sandpapered it 
You are sure you don’t want to 
transmog someone? A doctor 
should have a look at it.” 

“Just leave it as it is,” said 
Sheridan. “It will be all right.” 

Gideon stuck his head between 
the tent flaps. “Hezekiah, Abe is 
raising hell about the body you 
found for Max. He says it’s an 
old, rebuilt job. Have you got an- 
other one?” 

“I can look and see,” said Heze- 
kiah. “It was sort of dark. There 
are several more. We can look 
them over ” 

He left with Gideon, and Sheri- 
dan was alone. 

He went on eating, mentally 
checking through the happenings 
of the evening.

It had been hard luck, of course, 
but it could have been far worse. 
One had to expect accidents and 
headaches every now and then. 
After all, they had been down- 
right lucky. Except for some lost 
time and a floater load of cargo, 
they had come out unscathed. 

All in all, he assured himself, 
they’d made a good beginning. 
The cargo sled and ship were 
swinging in tight orbits, the cargo 
had been ferried down and on 
this small peninsula, jutting out 
into the lake, they had as much 
security as one might reasonably 
expect on any alien planet. 

The Garsonians, of course, were 
not belligerent, but even so one 
could never afford to skip security. 

He finished eating and pushed 
the plate aside. He pulled a port- 
folio out of a stack of maps and 
paper work lying on the desk. 
Slowly he untied the tapes and 
slid the contents out. For the hun- 
dredth time, at least, he started 
going through the summary of re- 
ports brought back to Central 
Trading by the first two expedi- 
tions. 

T \M AN first had come to the 
-L"-®- planet more than twenty 
years ago to make a preliminary 
check, bringing back field notes, 
photographs and samples. It had 
been mere routine; there had been 
no thorough or extensive survey. 
There had been no great hope nor 



expectation; it had been simply 
another job to do. Many planets 
were similarly spot-checked, and 
in nineteen out of twenty of them, 
nothing ever came of it 

But something very definite had 
come of it in the case of Garson IV. 

The something was a tuber that 
appeared quite ordinary, pretty 
much, in fact, like an undersize, 
shriveled-up potato. Brought back 
by the survey among other odds 
and ends picked up on the planet, 
it had in its own good time been 
given routine examination and 
analysis by the products laboratory 
— with startling results. 

From the podar, the tuber’s na- 
tive designation, had been derived 
a drug which had been given a 
long and agonizing name and had 
turned out to be the almost perfect 
tranquilizer. It appeared to have 
no untoward side-effects; it was 
not lethal if taken in too enthusias- 
tic dosage; it was slightly habit- 
forming, a most attractive feature 
for all who might be concerned 
with the sale of it. 

To a race vitally concerned with 
an increasing array of disorders 
traceable to tension, such a drug 
was a boon, indeed. For years, a 
search for such a tranquilizer had 
been carried on in the laboratories 
and here it suddenly was, a gift 
from a new-found planet. 

Within an astonishingly short 
time, considering the deliberation 
with which Central Trading usual- 



I NSTALLME NT PLAN 



17 




ly operated, a second expedition 
had been sent out to Garson IV, 
with the robotic team heavily 
transmogged as trade experts, psy- 
chologists and diplomatic func- 
tionaries. For two years the team 
had worked, with generally satis- 
factory results. When they had 
blasted off for Earth, they carried 
a cargo of the podars, a mass of 
meticulously gathered data and a 
trade agreement under which the 
Garsonians agreed to produce and 
store the podars against the day 
when another team should arrive 
to barter for them. 

And that, thought Sheridan, is 
us. 

And it was all right, of course, 
except that they were late by fif- 
teen years. 

For Central Trading, after many 
conferences, had decided to grow 
the podars on the Earth. This, the 
economists had pointed out, would 
be far cheaper than making the 
long and expensive trips that would 
be necessrry to import them from a 
distant planet. That it might leave 
the Garsonians holding the bag 
insofar as the trade agreement was 
concerned seemed not to have oc- 
curred to anyone at all. Although, 
considering the nature of the Gar- 
sonians, they probably had not 
been put out too greatly. 

For the Garsonians were a shift- 
less tribe at best and it had been 
with some initial difficulty that the 
second team had been able to ex- 



plain to them the mechanics and 
desirability of interstellar trade. Al- 
though, in fairness, it might be said 
of them that, once they understood 
it, they had been able to develop a 
creditable amount of eagerness to 
do business. 

X^ODARS had taken to the soil 
•*- of Earth with commendable 
adaptiveness. They had grown big- 
ger and better than they’d ever 
grown on their native planet. This 
was not surprising when one took 
into account the slap-dash brand of 
agriculture practiced by the Gar- 
sonians. 

Using the tubers brought back 
by the second expedition for the 
initial crop, it required several 
years of growing before a suffi- 
cient supply of seed podars were 
harvested to justify commercial 
growing. 

But finally that had come about 
and the first limited supply of the 
wonder drug had been processed 
and put on sale with wide adver- 
tising fanfare and an accompany- 
ing high price. 

And all seemed well, indeed. 

Once again the farmers of the 
Earth had gained a new cash crop 
from an alien planet. Finally Man 
had the tranquilizer which he’d 
sought for years. 

But as the years went by, some 
of the enthusiasm dimmed. For 
the drug made from the podars ap- 
peared to lose its potency. Either 



18 



GALAXY 




it had not been as good as first 
believed or there was some factor 
lacking in its cultivation on Earth. 

The laboratories worked fever- 
ishly on the problem. The podars 
were planted in experimental plots 
on other planets in the hope that 
the soil or air or general charac- 
teristics there might supply the 
needed element — if missing ele- 
ment it were. 

And Central Trading, in its pon- 
derous, bureaucratic fashion, began 
preliminary plans for importation 
of the tubers, remembering be- 
latedly, perhaps, the trade agree- 
ment signed many years before. 
But the plans were not pushed too 
rapidly, for any day, it was be- 
lieved, the answer might be found 
that would save the crop for Earth. 

But when the answer came, it 
ruled out Earth entirely; it ruled 
out, in fact, every place but the 
podax’s native planet. For, the lab- 
oratories found, the continued po- 
tency of the drug relied to a large 
extent upon the chemical reaction 
of a protozoan which the podar 
plants nourished in their roots. And 
the protozoan flourished, apparent- 
ly, on Garson IV alone. 

So finally, after more than fif- 
teen years, the third expedition 
had started out for Garson IV. 
And had landed and brought the 
cargo down and now was ready, 
in the morning, to start trading 
for the podars. 

Sheridan flipped idly through 



the sheets from the portfolio. 
There was, he thought, actually no 
need to look at all the data once 
again. He knew it all by heart 

^ I 'HE canvas rustled and Heze- 
kiah stepped into the tent. 
Sheridan looked up. “Good ” he 
said, “you’re back. Did you get 
Max fixed up?” 

“We found a body, sir, that 
proved acceptable.” 

Sheridan pushed the pile of re- 
ports aside. “Hezekiah, what are 
your impressions?” 

“Of the planet, sir?” 

“Precisely.” 

“Well, it’s those barns, sir. You 
saw them, sir, when we were com- 
ing down. I believe I mentioned 
them to you.” 

Sheridan nodded. “The second 
expedition taught the natives how 
to build them. To store the podars 
in.” 

“All of them painted red,” the 
robot said. “Just like the barns we 
have on Christmas cards.” 

“And what’s wrong with that?” 
“They look a little weird, sir.” 
Sheridan laughed. “Weird or not, 
those barns will be the making of 
us. They must be crammed with 
podars. For fifteen years, the na- 
tives have been piling up their 
podars, more than likely wonder- 
ing when we’d come to trade . .” 
“There were all those tiny vil- 
lages,” Hezekiah said, “and those 
big red barns in the village square. 

■ 19 



I NSTALLMENT PLAN 




It looked, if you will pardon the 
observation, sir, like a combina- 
tion of New England and Lower 
Slobbovia.” 

“Well, not quite Lower Slob- 
bovia. Our Garsonian friends are 
not as bad as that. They may be 
somewhat shiftless and consider- 
ably scatterbrained, but they keep 
their villages neat and their houses 
spic and span.” 

He pulled a photograph from a 
pile of data records. “Here, take a 
look at this.” 

The photograph showed a vil- 
lage street, neat and orderly and 
quiet, with its rows of well-kept 
houses huddled underneath the 
shade trees. There were rows of 
gay flowers running along the 
roadway and there were people — 
little, happy, gnomelike people — 
walking in the road. 

Hezekiah picked it up. “I will 
admit, sir, that they look fairly 
happy. Although, perhaps, not very 
smart.” 

Sheridan got to his feet. “I think 
I’ll go out and check around and 
see how things are going.” 

“Everything is all right, sir,” said 
Hezekiah. “The boys have the 
wreckage cleared up. I’m sorry to 
have to tell you, sir, that not much 
of the cargo could be saved.” 

“From the looks of it, I’m sur- 
prised we could salvage any of it.” 

“Don’t stay out too long,” Heze- 
kiah warned him, “You’ll need a 
good night’s sleep. Tomorrow will 



be a busy day and you’ll be out 
at the crack of dawn.” 

“I’ll be right back,” Sheridan 
promised and ducked out of the 
tent. 

T> ATTERIES of camp lights had 
U been erected and now held 
back the blackness of the night 
The sound of hammering came 
from the chewed-up area where 
the floater had come down. There 
was no sign of the floater now and 
a gang of spacehand robots were 
busily going about the building 
of another radio shack. Another 
gang was erecting a pavilion tent 
above the conference table, where 
Abraham and his fellow roboticists 
still worked on Lemuel and Maxi- 
milian. And in front of the cook 
shack, Napoleon and Gideon were 
squatted down, busily shooting 
craps. 

Sheridan saw that Napoleon had 
set up his outdoors stove again. 

He walked over to them and 
they turned their heads and greeted 
him, then went back to their game. 

Sheridan watched them for a 
while and then walked slowly on. 

He shook his head in some be- 
wilderment — a continuing bewil- 
derment over this robotic fascina- 
tion with all the games of chance. 
It was, he supposed, just one of 
the many things that a human be- 
ing — any human being — would 
never understand. 

For gambling seemed entirely 



20 



GALAXY 




pointless from a robotic point of 
view. They had no property, no 
money, no possessions. They had 
no need of any and they had no 
wish for any — and yet they gam- 
bled madly. 

It might be, he told himself, 
no more than an aping of their fel- 
low humans. By his very nature, 
a robot was barred effectively from 
participating in most of the human 
vices. But gambling was something 
that he could do as easily and per- 
haps more efficiently than any 
human could. 

But what in the world, he won- 
dered, did they get out of it? No 
gain, no profit, for there were no 
such things as gain or profit so far 
as a robot was concerned. Excite- 
ment, perhaps? An outlet for ag- 
gressiveness? 

Or did they keep a phantom 
score within their mind — men- 
tally chalking up their gains and 
loss — and did a heavy winner at 
a game of chance win a certain 
prestige that was not visible to 
Man, that might, in fact, be care- 
fully hidden from a man? 

A man, he thought, could never 
know his robots in their entirety 
and that might be as well — it 
would be an unfair act to strip the 
final shreds of individuality from 
a robot. 

For if the robots owed much to 
Man — their conception and their 
manufacture and their life — by 
the same token Man owed as 



much, or even more, to robots. 

Without the robots, Man could 
not have gone as far or fast, or 
as effectively, out into the Galaxy. 
Sheer lack of transportation for 
skilled manpower alone would 
have held his progress to a crawl. 

But with the robots there was 
no shipping problem. 

And with the transmogs there 
was likewise no shortage of the 
kind of brains and skills and tech- 
niques — as there would otherwise 
have been — necessary to cope 
with the many problems found on 
the far-flung planets. 

TTE came to the edge of the 
A-i- camp area and stood, with 
the lights . behind him, facing out 
into the dark from which came 
the sound of running waves and 
the faint moaning of the wind. 

He tilted back his head and 
stared up at the sky and marveled 
once again, as he had marveled 
many other times on many other 
planets, at the sheer, devastating 
loneliness and alienness of unfam- 
iliar stars. 

Man pinned his orientation to 
such fragile things, he thought — 
to the way the stars were grouped, 
to how a flower might smell, to 
the color of a sunset. 

But this, of course, was not en- 
tirely unfamiliar ground. Two hu- 
man expeditions already had 
touched down. 

And now the third had come, 



INSTALLMENT PLAN 



21 




bringing with it a cargo sled piled 
high with merchandise. 

He swung around, away from 
the lake, and squinted at the area 
just beyond the camp and there 
the cargo was, piled in heaps and 
snugged down with tough plastic 
covers from which the starlight 
glinted. It lay upon the alien soil 
like a herd of hump-backed mon- 
sters bedded for the night 

There was no ship built that 
could handle that much cargo — 
no ship that could carry more than 
a dribble of the merchandise needed 
for interstellar trade. 

For that purpose, there was the 
cargo sled. 

The sled, set in an orbit around 
the planet of its origin, was loaded 
by a fleet of floaters, shuttling 
back and forth. Loaded, the sled 
was manned by robots and given 
the start on its long journey by 
the expedition ship. By the dint 
of the engines on the sled itself 
and the power of the expedition 
ship, the speed built up and up. 

There was a tricky point when 
one reached the speed of light, but 
after that it became somewhat 
easier — although, for interstellar 
travel, there was need of speed 
many times in excess of the speed 
of light. 

And so the sled sped on, follow- 
ing close behind the expedition 
ship, which served as a pilot craft 
through that strange gray area 
where space and time were twisted 



into something other than normal 
space and time. 

Without robots, the cargo sleds 
would have been impossible; no 
human crew could ride a cargo 
ship and maintain the continuous 
routine of inspection that was ne- 
cessary. 

Sheridan swung back toward 
the lake again and wondered if 
he could actually see the curling 
whiteness of the waves or if it 
were sheer imagination. The wind 
was moaning softly and the 
stranger stars were there, and out 
beyond the waters the natives hud- 
dled in their villages with the big 
red barns looming in the starlit 
village squares. 

II 

TN the morning, the robots gath- 
ered around the conference 
table beneath the gay pavilion tent 
and Sheridan and Hezekiah lugged 
out the metal transmog boxes 
labeled special — garson IV. 

“Now I think,” said Sheridan, 
“that we can get down to busi- 
ness, if you gentlemen will pay 
attention to me.” He opened one 
of the transmog boxes. “In here, 
we have some transmogs tailor- 
made for the job that we’re to do. 
Because we had prior knowledge 
of this planet, it was possible to 
fabricate this special set. So on 
this job we won’t start from scratch, 
as we are often forced to do . *

“Cut out the speeches, Steve,” 
yelled Reuben, “and let’s get 
started with this business.” 

“Let him talk,” said Abraham. 
“He certainly has the right to, just 
like any one of us” 

“Thank you, Abe,” Sheridan 
said. 

“Go ahead,” said Gideon. 
“Rube’s just discharging excess 
voltage.” 

“These transmogs are basically 
sales transmogs, of course. They 
will provide you with the person- 
ality and all the techniques of a 
salesman. But, in addition to that, 
they contain as well all the data 
pertaining to the situation here and 
the language of the natives, plus 
a mass of planetary facts.” 

He unlocked another of the 
boxes and flipped back the lid. 

“Shall we get on with it?” he 
asked. 

“Let’s get going,” demanded 
Reuben. “I’m tired of this space- 
hand transmog.” 

Sheridan made the rounds, with 
Hezekiah carrying the boxes for 
him. 

Back at his starting point, he 
shoved aside the boxes, filled now 
with spacehand and other assorted 
transmogs. He faced the crew of 
salesmen. 

“How do they feel?” he asked. 

“They feel okay,” said Lemuel. 
“You know, Steve, I never realized 
until now how dumb a spacehand 
is.” 



“Pay no attention to him,” Abra- 
ham said, disgusted. “He always 
makes that crack ” 

Maximilian said soberly: “It 

shouldn’t be too bad. These peo- 
ple have been acclimated to the 
idea of doing business with us. 
There should be no initial sales 
resistance. In fact, they may be 
anxious to start trading.” 

“Another thing,” Douglas pointed 
out. “We have the kind of mer- 
chandise they’ve evinced interest 
in. We won’t have to waste our 
time in extensive surveys to find 
out what they want.” 

“The market pattern seems to 
be a simple one,” said Abraham 
judiciously. “There should be no 
complications. The principal thing, 
it would appear, is the setting of 
a proper rate of exchange — how 
many podars they must expect to 
pay for a shovel or a hoe or other 
items that we have.” 

“That will have to come,” said 
Sheridan, “by a process of trial 
and error.” 

“We’ll have to bargain hard,” 
Lemuel said, “in order to establish 
a fictitious retail price, then let 
them have it wholesale. There are 
many times when that works effec- 
tively.” 

Abraham rose from his chair. 
“Let’s get on with it. I suppose, 
Steve, that you will stay in camp.” 
Sheridan nodded. “I’ll stay by 
the radio. I’ll expect reports as 
soon as you can send them.”

r T , HE robots got on with it They 
-*■ scrubbed and polished one an- 
other until they fairly glittered. 
They brought out fancy dress hard- 
ware and secured it to themselves 
with magnetic clamps. There were 
colorful sashes and glistening rows 
of metals and large chunks of 
jewelry not entirely in the best of 
taste, but designed to impress the 
natives. 

They got out their floaters and 
loaded up with samples from the 
cargo dump. Sheridan spread out 
a map and assigned each one a 
village. They checked their radios. 
They made sure they had their 
order boards. 

By noon, they all were off. 

Sheridan went back to the tent 
and sat down in his camp chair. 
He stared down the shelving 
beach to the lake, sparkling in the 
light of the noon-high sun. 

Napoleon brought his lunch and 
hunkered down to talk, gathering 
his white cook’s apron carefully 
in his lap so it would not touch 
the ground. He pushed his tall 
white cap to a rakish angle. 

“How you got it figured, Steve?” 

“You can never figure one be- 
forehand,” Sheridan told him. “The 
boys are all set for an easy time 
and I hope they have it. But this 
is an alien planet and I never bet 
on aliens.” 

“You look for any trouble?” 

“I don’t look for anything. I just 
sit and wait and hope feebly for 



the best. Once the reports start 
coming in . ” 

“If you worry so much, why not 
go out yourself?” 

Sheridan shook his head. “Look 
at it this way, Nappy. I am not a 
salesman and this crew is. There’d 
be no sense in my going out. I’m 
not trained for it” 

And, he thought, the fact of the 
matter was that he was not trained 
for anything. He was not a sales- 
man and he was not a spacehand; 
he was not any of the things that 
the robots were or could be. 

He was just a human, period, 
a necessary cog in a team of robots. 

There was a law that said no 
robot or no group of robots could 
be assigned a task without human 
supervision, but that was not the 
whole of it. It was, rather, some- 
thing innate in the robot makeup, 
not built into them, but something 
that was there and always might 
be there — the ever-present link 
between the robot and his human. 

Sent out alone, a robot team 
would blunder and bog down, 
would in the end become unstuck 
entirely — would wind up worse 
than useless. With a human ac- 
companying them, there was al- 
most no end to their initiative and 
their capability. 

It might, he thought, be their 
need of leadership, although in 
very truth the human member of 
the team sometimes showed little 
of that. It might be the necessity 



24 



G A L A X Y 




for some symbol of authority and 
yet, aside from their respect and 
consideration for their human, the 
robots actually bowed to no au- 
thority. 

It was something deeper, Sheri- 
dan told himself, than mere lead- 
ership or mere authority. It was 
comparable to the affection and 
rapport which existed as an un- 
dying bond between a man and 
dog and yet it had no tinge of the 
god-worship associated with the 
dog. 

TTE said to Napoleon: “How 
about yourself? Don’t you 
ever hanker to go out? If you’d 
' just say the word, you could.” 

“I like to cook,” Napoleon 
stated. He dug at the ground with 
a metal finger. “I guess, Steve, you 
could say I’m pretty much an old 
retainer.” 

“A transmog would take care of 
that in a hurry.” 

“And then who’d cook for you? 
You know you’re a lousy cook.” 
Sheridan ate his lunch and sat 
in his chair, staring at the lake, 
Waiting for the first reports on the 
radio. 

The job at last was started. All 
that had gone before — the loading 
of the cargo, the long haul out 
through space, the establishing of 
the orbits and the unshipping of 
the cargo — had been no more 
than preliminary to this very 
moment. 



The job was finally started, but 
it was far from done. There would 
be months of work. There would 
be many problems and a thousand 
headaches. But they’d get it done, 
he told himself with a sure pride. 
There was nothing, absolutely 
nothing, that could stump this 
gang of his. 

Late in the afternoon, Hezekiah 
came with the word: “Abraham is 
calling, sir. It seems that there is 
trouble.” 

Sheridan leaped to his feet and 
ran to the shack. He pulled up a 
chair and reached for the headset. 
“That you, Abe? How is it going, 
boy?” 

“Badly, Steve,” said Abraham. 
“They aren’t interested in doing 
business. They want the stuff, all 
right. You can see the way they 
look at it. But they aren’t buying. 
You know what I think? I don’t 
believe they have anything to 
trade.” 

“That’s ridiculous, Abe! They’ve 
been growing podars all these 
years. The bams are crammed with 
them.” 

“Their barn is all nailed up,” 
said Abraham. “They have bars 
across the doors and the windows 
boarded. When I tried to walk up 
to it, they acted sort of ugly.” 

“I’ll be right out,” decided Sheri- 
dan. “I want to look this over.” He 
stood up and walked out of the 
shack. “Hezekiah, get the flier 
started. We’re going out and have 



NSTALLMENT PLAN 



25 




a talk with Abe. Nappy, you mind 
the radio. Call me at Abe’s vil- 
lage if anything goes wrong.’’ 

“I’ll stay right here beside it,” 
Napoleon promised him. 

Hezekiah brought the flier down 
in the village square, landing it be- 
side the floater, still loaded with 
its merchandise. 

Abraham strode over to them as 
soon as they were down. “I’m glad 
you came, Steve. They want me 
out of here. They don’t want us 
around.” 

S HERIDAN climbed from the 
flier and stood stiffly in the 
square. There was a sense of wrong- 
ness —a wrongness with the village 
and the people something wrong 
and different. 

There were a lot of natives 
standing around the square, loung- 
ing in the doorways and leaning 
against the trees. There was a 
group of them before the barred 
door of the massive barn that stood 
in the center of the square, as if 
they might be a guard assigned to 
protect the barn. 

“When I first came down,” said 
Abraham, “they crowded around 
the floater and stood looking at 
the stuff and you could see they 
could hardly keep their hands off 
it. I tried to talk to them, but they 
wouldn’t talk too much, except 
to say that they were poor. Now 
all they do is just stand off and 
glare.” 



The bam was a monumental 
structure when gauged against the 
tiny houses of the village. It stood 
up foursquare and solid and en- 
tirely without ornament and it was 
an alien thing — alien of Earth. 
For, Sheridan realized, it was the 
same kind of barn that he had seen 
on the backwoods farms of Earth 
— the great hip-roof, the huge bam 
door, the ramp up to the door, and 
even the louvered cupola that rode 
astride the ridge-pole. 

The man and the two robots 
stood in a pool of hostile silence 
and the lounging natives kept on 
staring at them and there was 
something decidedly wrong. 

Sheridan turned slowly and 
glanced around the square and 
suddenly he knew what the wrong- 
ness was. 

The place was shabby; it ap- 
proached the downright squalid. 
The houses were neglected and no 
longer neat and the streets were 
littered. And the people were a 
piece with all the rest of it. 

“Sir,” said Hezekiah, “they are 
a sorry lot.” 

And they were all of that 

There was something in their 
faces that had a look of haunting 
and their shoulders stooped and 
there was fatigue upon them. 

“I can’t uhderstand it,” said the 
puzzled Abraham. “The data says 
they were a happy-go-lucky bunch, 
but look at them out there. Could 
the data have been wrong?” 



26

I NSTAL 



“No, Abe. It’s the people who 
have changed.” 

For there was no chance that 
the data could be wrong. It had 
been compiled by a competent 
team, one of the very best, and 
headed by a human who had long 
years of experience on many alien 
planets. The team had spent two 
years on Garson IV and had made 
it very much its business to know 
this race inside out. 

Something had happened to the 
.people. They had somehow lost 
their gaiety and pride. They had 
let the houses go uncared for. They 
had allowed themselves to become 
a race of ragamuffins. 

“You guys stay here,” Sheridan 
said. 

“You can’t do it, sir,” said He- 
zekiah in alarm. 

“Watch yourself,” warned Abra- 
ham. 

Sheridan walked toward the 
barn. The group before it did not 
stir. He stopped six feet away. 

LOSE up, they looked more 
^ gnomelike than they had ap- 
peared in the pictures brought 
back by the survey team. Little 
wizened gnomes, they were, but 
not happy gnomes at all. They 
were seedy-looking and there was 
resentment in them and perhaps a 
dash of hatred. They had a hang- 
dog look and there were some 
among them who shuffled in dis- 
comfiture. 



“I see you don’t remember us,” 
said Sheridan conversationally. 
“We were away too long, much 
longer than we had thought to be.” 
He was having, he feared, some 
trouble with the language. It was, 
in fact, not the easiest language 
in the Galaxy to handle. For a 
fleeting moment, he wished that 
there were some sort of transmog 
that could be slipped into the hu- 
man brain. It would make mo- 
ments like this so much easier. 

“We remember you,” said one 
of them in a sullen voice. 

“That’s wonderful,” said Sheri- 
dan with forced enthusiasm. “Are 
you speaker for this village?” 
Speaker because there was no 
leader, no chief — no government 
at all beyond a loose, haphazard 
talking over what daily problems 
they had, around the local equiva- 
lent of the general store, and oc- 
casional formless town meetings 
to decide what to do in their rare 
crises, but no officials to enforce 
the decisions. 

“I can speak for them,” the na- 
tive said somewhat evasively. He 
shuffled slowly forward. “There 
were others like you who came 
many years ago.” 

“You were friends to them.” 
“We are friends to all.” 

“But special friends to them. To 
them you made the promise that 
you would keep the podais." 

“Too long to keep the podars. 
The podars rot away.” 



28 



GALAXY 




“You had the bam to store them 
in.” 

“One podar rots. Soon there are 
two podars rotten. And then a 
hundred podars rotten. The barn 
is no good to keep them. No place 
is any good to keep them.” 

“But we — those others showed 
you what to do. You go through 
the podars and throw away the 
rotten ones. That way you keep 
the other podars good.” 

The native shrugged. “Too hard 
to do. Takes too long.” 

“But not all the podars rotted. 
Surely you have some left.” 

The creature spread its hands. 
“We have bad seasons, friend. Too 
little rain, too much. It never comes 
out right. Our crop is always bad.” 
“But we have brought things to 
trade you for the podars. Many 
things you need. We had great 
trouble bringing them. We came 
from far away. It took us long to 
come.” 

“Too bad,” the native said. “No 
podars. As you can see, we are 
very poor.” 

“But where have all the podars 
gone?” 

“We,” the man said stubbornly, 
“don’t grow podars any more. We 
changed the podars into another 
crop. Too much bad luck with 
podars .” 

“But those plants out in the 
fields?” 

“We do not call them podars .” 
“It doesn’t matter what you call 



them. Are they podars or are they 
not?” 

“We do not grow the podars.” 

S HERIDAN turned on his heel 
and walked back to the robots. 
“No soap,” he said. “Something’s 
happened here. They gave me a 
poor-mouth story and finally, as a 
clincher, said they don’t grow po- 
dars any more.” 

“But there are fields of podars 
declared Abraham. “If the data’s 
right, they’ve actually increased 
their acreage. I checked as I was 
coming in. They’re growing more 
right now than they ever grew be- 
fore.” 

“I know,” said Sheridan. “It 
makes no sense at all. Hezekiah, 
maybe you should give base a call 
and find what’s going on.” 

“One thing,” Abraham pointed 
out. “What about this trade agree- 
ment that we have with them? 
Has it any force?” 

Sheridan shook his head. “I 
don’t know. Maybe we can wave it 
in their faces, just to see what hap- 
pens. It might serve as a sort of 
psychological wedge a little later 
on, once we get them softened up 
a bit.” 

“// we get them softened up.” 
“This is our first day and this 
is only one village.” 

“You don’t think we could use 
the agreement as a club?” 

“Look, Abe, I’m not a lawyer, 
and we don’t have a lawyer trans-

mog along with us for a damned 
good reason — there isn’t any legal 
setup whatever on this planet. 
But let’s say we could haul them 
into a galactic court. Who signed 
for the planet? Some natives we 
picked as its representatives, not 
the natives themselves; their sign- 
ing couldn’t bind anything or any- 
body. The whole business of draw- 
ing up a contract was nothing but 
an impressive ceremony without 
any legal basis — it was just meant 
to awe the natives into doing busi- 
ness with us.” 

“But the second expedition must 
have figured it would work.” 
“Well, sure. The Garsonians 
have a considerable sense of 
morality — individually and as 
families. Can we make that sense 
of morality extend to bigger 
groups? That’s our problem.” 
“That means we have to figure 
out an angle,” said Abraham. “At 
least for this one village.” 

“If ifs just this village,” declared 
Sheridan, “we can let them sit 
and wait. We can get along with- 
out it.” 

But it wasn’t just one village. 
It was all the rest of them, as well. 
Hezekiah brought the news. 
“Napoleon says everyone is hav- 
ing trouble,” he announced. “No 
one sold a thing. From what he 
said, it’s just like this all over.” 
“We better call in all the boys,” 
said Sheridan. “This is a situation 
that needs some talking over. We’ll 



have to plan a course of action. We 
can’t go flying off at a dozen dif- 
ferent angles.” 

“And we’d better pull up a hill 
of podars,” Abraham suggested, 
“and see if they are podars or 
something else.” 

Ill 

^HERIDAN inserted a chemist 
^ transmog into Ebenezer’s 
brain case and Ebenezer ran off 
an analysis. 

He reported to the sales confer- 
ence seated around the table. 

“There’s just one difference,” he 
said. “The podars that I analyzed 
ran a higher percentage of calen- 
thropodensia— that’s the drug used 
as a tranquilizer — than the podars 
that were brought in by the first 
and second expeditions. The factor 
is roughly ten per cent, although 
that might vary from one field to 
another, depending upon weather 
and soil conditions — I would sus- 
pect especially soil conditions.” 

“Then they lied,” said Abraham, 
“when they said they weren’t grow- 
ing podars .” 

“By their own standards,” ob- 
served Silas, “they might not have 
lied to us. You can’t always spell 
out alien ethics — satisfactorily, 
that is — from the purely human 
viewpoint. Ebenezer says that the 
composition of the tuber has 
changed to some extent. Perhaps 
due to better cultivation, perhaps 



30 



GALAXY 




to better seed or to an abundance 
of rainfall or a heavier concentra- 
tion of the protozoan in the soil — 
or maybe because of something the 
natives did deliberately to make 
it shift . ” 

“Si,” said Gideon, “I don’t see 
what you are getting at.” 

“Simply this. If they knew of 
the shift or change, it might have 
given them an excuse to change 
the podar name. Or their language 
or their rules of grammar might 
have demanded that they change 
it. Or they may have applied some 
verbal mumbo-pumbo so they 
would have an out. And it might 
even have been a matter of super- 
stition. The native told Steve at 
the village that they’d had bad 
luck with podars. So perhaps they 
operated under the premise that if 
they changed the name, they like- 
wise changed the luck.” 

“And this is ethical?” 

“To them, it might be. You fel- 
lows have been around enough to 
know that the rest of the Galaxy 
seldom operates on what we view 
as logic or ethics.” 

“But I don’t see,” said Gideon, 
“why they’d want to change the 
name unless it was for the specific 
purpose of not trading with us — 
so they could tell us they weren’t 
growing podars .” 

“I think that is exactly why 
they changed the name,” Maxi- 
milian said. “It’s all a piece with 
those nailed-up barns. They knew 



we had arrived. They could hardly 
have escaped knowing. We had 
clouds of floaters going up and 
down and they must have seen 
them.” 

“Back at that village,” said 
Sheridan, “I had the distinct im- 
pression that they had some reluc- 
tance telling us they weren’t grow- 
ing podars. They had left it to the 
last, as if it were a final clincher 
they’d hoped they wouldn’t have 
to use, a desperate, last-ditch argu- 
ment when all the other excuses 
failed to do the trick and—” 

“They’re just trying to jack up 
the price,” Lemuel interrupted in a 
flat tone. 

jl/I AXIMILIAN shook his head. 
IT-1 don’t think so. There was 
no price set to start with. How can 
you jack it up when you don’t 
know what it is?” 

“Whether there was a price or 
not,” said Lemuel testily, “they 
still could create a situation where 
they could hold us up.” 

“There is another factor that 
might be to our advantage,” Maxi- 
milian said. “If they changed the 
name so they’d have an excuse not 
to trade with us, that argues that 
the whole village feels a moral ob- 
ligation and has to justify its re- 
fusal.” 

“You mean by that,” said Sheri- 
dan, “that we can reason with them. 
Well, perhaps we can. I think at 
least we’ll try.”

“There’s too much wrong,” 
Douglas put in. “Too many things 
have changed. The new name for 
the podars and the nailed-up barns 
and the shabbiness of the villages 
and the people. The whole planet’s 
gone to pot. It seems to me our 
job — the first job we do — is to 
find what happened here. Once we 
find that out, maybe we’d have a 
chance of selling.” 

ff¥’D like to see the inside of 
those barns,” said Joshua. 
“What have they got in there? Do 
you think there’s any chance we 
might somehow get a look?” 

“Nothing short of force,” Abra- 
ham told him. “I have a hunch that 
While we’re around, they’ll guard 
them night and day.” 

“Force is out,” said Sheridan. 
“All of you know what would hap- 
pen to us if we used force short of 
self-defense against an alien peo- 
ple. The entire team would have 
its license taken away. You guys 
would spend the rest of your lives 
scrubbing out headquarters.” 
“Maybe we could just sneak 
around. Do some slick detective 
work.” 

“That’s an idea, Josh,” Sheridan 
said. “Hezekiah, do you know if 
we have some detective trans- 
mogs?” 

“Not that I know of, sir. I have 
never heard of any team using 
them.” 

“Just as well,” Abraham ob- 



served. “We’d have a hard time 
disguising ourselves.” 

“If we had a volunteer,” Lemuel 
said with some enthusiasm, “we 
could redesign him . ” 

“It would seem to me,” said 
Silas, “that what we have to do 
is figure out all the different ap- 
proaches that are possible. Then 
we can try each approach on a 
separate village till we latch onto 
one that works.” 

“Which presupposes,” Maximil- 
ian pointed out, “that each village 
will react the same.” 

Silas said: “I would assume 
they would. After all, the culture 
is the same and their communica- 
tions must be primitive. No village 
would know what was happening 
in another village until some little 
time had passed, which makes each 
village a perfectly isolated guinea 
pig for our little tests.” 

“Si, I think you’re right,” said 
Sheridan. “Somehow or other we 
have to find a way to break their 
sales resistance. I don’t care what 
kind of prices we have to pay for 
the podars at the moment. I’d be 
willing to let them skin us alive to 
start with. Once we have them 
buying, we can squeeze down the 
price and come out even in the 
end. After all, the main thing is 
to get that cargo sled of ours 
loaded down with all the podars it 
can carry.” 

“All right,” said Abraham. “Let’s 
get to work.”

r l 1 HEY got to work. They spent 
* the whole day at it They 
mapped out the various sales ap- 
proaches. They picked the villages 
where each one would be tried. 
Sheridan divided the robots into 
teams and assigned a team to each 
project They worked out every 
detail. They left not a thing to 
chance. 

Sheridan sat down to his sup- 
per table with the feeling that they 
had it made — if one of the ap- 
proaches didn't work, another sure- 
ly would. The trouble was that, 
as he saw it, they had done no 
planning. They had been so sure 
that this was an easy one that they 
had plunged ahead into straight 
selling without any thought upon 
the matter. 

In the morning, the robots went 
out, full of confidence. 

Abraham’s crew had been as- 
signed to a house-to-house cam- 
paign and they worked hard and 
conscientiously. They didn’t miss 
a single house in the entire vil- 
lage. At every house, the answer 
had been no. Sometimes it was a 
firm but simple no; sometimes it 
was a door slammed in the face; 
at other times, it was a plea of 
poverty. 

One thing was plain: Individual 
Garsonians could be cracked no 
more readily than Garsonians en 
masse. 

Gideon and his crew tried the 
sample racket — handing out gift 



samples door to door with the un- 
derstanding they would be back 
again to display their wares. The 
Garsonian householders weren’t 
having any. They refused to take 
the samples. 

Lemuel headed up the lottery 
project. A lottery, its proponents 
argued, appealed to basic greed. 
And this lottery had been rigged 
to carry maximum appeal. The 
price was as low as it could be 
set — one podar for a ticket. The 
list of prizes offered was just this 
side of fabulous. But the Garson- 
ians, as it appeared, were not a 
greedy people. Not a ticket , was 
sold. 

And the funny thing about it— 
the unreasonable, maddening, im- 
possible thing about it — was that 
the Garsonians seemed tempted. 

“You could see them fighting 
it,” Abraham reported at the con- 
ference that night “You could see 
they wanted something we had 
for sale, but they’d steel themselves 
against it and they never weak- 
ened.” 

“We may have them on the very 
edge,” said Lemuel. “Maybe just 
a little push is all it will take. Do 
you suppose we could start a whis- 
pering campaign? Maybe we could 
get it rumored that some other 
villages are buying right and left. 
That should weaken the resist- 
ance.” 

But Ebenezer was doubtful. “We 
have to dig down to causes. We

have to find out what is behind 
this buyers’ strike. It may be a 
very simple thing. If we only 
knew . 

t 1 BENEZER took out a team to 
" a distant village. They hauled 
along with them a pre-fabricated 
supermarket, which they set up in 
the village square. They racked 
their wares attractively. They 
loaded the place with glamor and 
excitement. They installed loud- 
speakers all over town to bellow 
out their bargains. 

Abraham and Gideon headed 
up two talking-billboard crews. 
They ranged far and wide, setting 
up their billboards, splashed with 
attractive color, and installing 
propaganda tapes. 

Sheridan had transmogged 
Oliver and Silas into semantics ex- 
perts and they had engineered the 
tapes — a careful, skillful job. They 
did not bear down too blatantly 
on the commercial angle, although 
it certainly was there. The tapes 
were cuddly in spots and candid 
in others. At all times, they rang 
with deep sincerity. They sang 
the praises of the Garsonians for 
the decent, upstanding folks they 
were; they preached pithy homilies 
on honesty and fairness and the 
keeping of contracts; they pre- 
sented the visitors as a sort of cross 
between public benefactors and 
addle-pated nitwits who could 
easily be outsmarted. 



The tapes ran day and night 
They pelted the defenseless Gar- 
sonians with a smooth, sleek ad- 
vertising — and the effects should 
have been devastating, since the 
Garsonians were entirely unfamil- 
iar with any kind of advertising. 

Lemuel stayed behind at base 
and tramped up and down the 
beach, with his hands clenched be- 
hind his back, thinking furiously. 
At times he stopped his pacing 
long enough to scribble frantic 
notes, jotting down ideas. 

Lemuel was trying to arrive at 
some adaptation of an old sales 
gag that he felt sure would work 
if he could only get it figured out 
— the ancient I-am-working-my- 
way-through-college wheeze. 

Joshua and Thaddeus came to 
Sheridan for a pair of playwright 
transmogs. Sheridan said they had 
none, but Hezekiah, forever op- 
timistic, ferreted into the bottom of 
the transmog chest He came up 
with one transmog labeled auction- 
eer and another public speaker. 
They were the closest he could 
find. 

Disgusted, the two rejected them 
and retired into seclusion, working 
desperately and as best they could 
on a medicine show routine. 

For example, how did one write 
jokes for an alien people? What 
would they regard as funny? The 
off-color joke — oh, very fine, ex- 
cept that one would have to know 
in some detail the sexual life of 



34 



GALAXY 




the people it was aimed at The 
mother-in-law joke — once again 
one would have to know; there 
were a lot of places where mothers- 
in-law were held in high regard, 
and other places where it was bad 
taste to even mention them. The 
dialect routine, of course, was 
strictly out, as it well deserved to 
be. Also, so far as the Garsonians 
were concerned, was the business 
slicker joke. The Garsonians were 
no commercial people; such a joke 
would sail clear above their heads. 

"OUT Joshua and Thaddeus, for 
all of that, were relatively un- 
daunted. They requisitioned the 
files of data from Sheridan and 
spent hours poring over them, 
analyzing the various aspects of 
Garsonian life that might be safe- 
ly written into their material. They 
made piles of notes. They drafted 
intricate charts showing relation- 
ships of Garsonian words and the 
maze of native social life. They 
wrote and rewrote and revised and 
polished. Eventually, they ham- 
mered out their script 

“There’s nothing like a show,” 
Joshua told Sheridan with con- 
viction, “to loosen up a people. 
You get them feeling good and 
they lose their inhibitions. Besides, 
you have made them become 
somewhat indebted to you. You 
have entertained them and natu- 
rally they must feel the need to 
reciprocate.” 



“I hope it works,” said Sheridan, 
somewhat doubtful and discour- 
aged. 

For nothing else was working. 

In the distant village, the Gar- 
sonians had unbent sufficiently to 
visit the supermarket — to visit, 
not to buy. It almost seemed as 
if to them the market was some 
great museum or showplace. They 
would file down the aisles and 
goggle at the merchandise and at 
times reach out and touch it, but 
they didn’t buy. They were, in 
fact, insulted if one suggested per- 
haps they’d like to buy. 

In the other villages, the bill- 
boards had at first attracted wide 
attention. Crowds had gathered 
around them and had listened by 
the hour. But the novelty had 
worn off by now and they paid 
the tapes very little attention. And 
they still continued to ignore the 
robots. Even more pointedly, they 
ignored or rebuffed all attempts to 
sell. 

It was disheartening. 

Lemuel gave up his pacing and 
threw away his notes. He admitted 
he was licked. There was no way, 
on Garson IV, to adapt the idea of 
the college salesman. 

Baldwin headed up a team that 
tried to get the whisper campaign 
started. The natives flatly disbe- 
lieved that any other village would 
go out and buy. 

There remained the medicine 
show and Joshua and Thaddeus

had a troupe rehearsing. The proj- 
ect was somewhat hampered by 
the fact that even Hezekiah could 
not dig up any actor transmogs, 
but, even so, they were doing well. 

Despite the failure of every- 
thing they had tried, the robots 
kept going out to the villages, kept 
plugging away, kept on trying to 
sell, hoping that one day they 
would get a clue, a hint, an indi- 
cation that might help them break 
the shell of reserve and obstinacy 
set up by the natives. 

One day Gideon, out alone, 
radioed to base. 

“There’s something out here un- 
derneath a tree that you should 
take a look at,” he told Sheridan. 

“Something?” 

“A different kind of being. It 
looks intelligent” 

“A Garsonian?” 

“Humanoid, all right, but it's 
no Garsonian ” 

“I’ll be right out,” said Sheridan. 
“You stay there so you can point 
it out to me.” 

“It has probably seen me,” 
Gideon said, “but I did not ap- 
proach it I thought you might 
like first whack at it yourself.” 

A S Gideon had said, the creature 
was sitting underneath a tree. 
It had a glittering cloth spread out 
and an ornate jug set out and was 
taking things out of a receptacle 
that probably was a hamper. 

It was more attractively hu- 



manoid than the Garsonians. Its 
features were finely chiseled and 
its body had a look of lithe rangi- 
ness. It was dressed in the richest 
fabrics and was all decked out 
with jewels. It had a decided so- 
cial air about it 

“Hello, friend,” Sheridan said in 
Garsonian. 

The creature seemed to under- 
stand him, but it smiled in a su- 
perior manner and seemed not to 
be too happy at Sheridan's intru- 
sion. 

“Perhaps,” it finally said, “you 
have the time to sit down for a 
while.” 

Which, the way that was put, 
was a plain and simple invitation 
for Sheridan to say no, he was 
sorry, but he hadn’t and he must 
be getting on. 

“Why, certainly,” said Sheridan. 
“Thank you very much.” 

He sat down and watched the 
creature continue to extract things 
from the hamper. 

“It's slightly difficult,” the crea- 
ture told him, “for us to commu- 
nicate in this barbaric language. 
But I suppose it’s the best we can 
do. You do not happen to know 
Bailie, do you?” 

“I’m sorry,” said Sheridan. T’ve 
never heard of it.” 

“I had thought you might It 
is widely used.” 

“We can get along,” said Sheri- 
dan quietly, “with the language 
native to this planet” 



36 



GALAXY 




“Oh, certainly ,” agreed the crea- 
ture. “I presume I’m not trespass- 
ing. If I am, of course—” 

“Not at all. I’m glad to find you 
here.” 

“I would offer you some food, 
but I hesitate to do so. Your 
metabolism undoubtedly is not the 
same as mine. It should pain me 
to poison you.” 

Sheridan nodded to indicate his 
gratitude. The food indeed was 
tempting. All of it was packaged 
attractively and some of it looked 
so delectable that it set the mouth 
to watering. 

“I often come here for . .” The 
creature hunted for the Garsonian 
word and there wasn’t any. 

Sheridan tried to help him out. 
“I think in my language I would 
call it picnic.” 

“An eating-out-of-doors,” the 
stranger said. “That is the nearest 
I can come in the language of our 
host.” 

“We have the same idea.” 

The creature brightened up con- 
siderably at this evidence of mu- 
tual understanding. “I think, my 
friend, that we have much in com- 
mon. Perhaps I could leave some 
of this food with you and you 
could analyze it. Then the next 
time I come, you could join me.” 

SHERIDAN shook his head. “I 
^ doubt I’ll stay much longer.” 

“Oh,” the stranger said, and he 
seemed pleased at it. “So you’re a 



transitory being, too. Wings pass- 
ing in the night. One hears a rustle 
and then the sound is gone for- 
ever.” 

“A most poetic thought,” said 
Sheridan, “and a most descriptive 
one.” 

“Although,” the creature said, “I 
come here fairly often. I’ve grown 
to love this planet It is such a 
fine spot for an eating-out-of-doors. 
So restful and simple and unhur- 
ried. It is not cluttered up with ac- 
tivity and the people are so gen- 
uine, albeit somewhat dirty and 
very, very stupid. But I find it in 
my heart to love them for their 
lack of sophistication and their 
closeness to the soil and the clear- 
eyed view of life and their uncom- 
plicated living of that life.” 

He halted his talk and cocked 
an eye at Sheridan. 

“Don’t you find it so, my 
friend?” 

“Yes, of course I do,” agreed 
Sheridan, rather hurriedly. 

“There are so few places in the 
Galaxy,” mourned the stranger, 
“where one can be alone in com- 
fort. Oh, I do not mean alone en- 
tirely, or even physically. But an 
aloneness in the sense that there 
is space to live, that one is not 
pushed about by boundless, blind 
ambitions or smothered by the im- 
pact of other personalities. There 
are, of course, the lonely planets 
which are lonely only by the virtue 
of their being impossible for one

to exist upon. These we must rule 
out.” 

He ate a little, daintily, and in a 
mincing manner. But he took a 
healthy snort from the ornate jug. 

“This is excellent,” said the 
creature, holding out the jug. “You 
are sure you do not want to chance 
it?” 

“I think I’d better not” 

“I suppose it’s wise of you,” the 
stranger admitted. “Life is not a 
thing that a person parts from with- 
out due consideration .” 

He had another drink, then put 
the jug down in his lap and sat 
there fondling it. 

“Not that I am one,” he said, 
“to extoll the virtue of living above 
all other things. Surely there must 
be other facets of the universal 
pattern that have as much to 
offer ...” 

They spent a pleasant afternoon 
together. 

When Sheridan went back to 
the flier, the creature had finished 
off the jug and was sprawled, hap- 
pily pickled, among the litter of 
the picnic. 

IV 

RASPING at straws, Sheridan 
tried to fit the picnicking 
alien into the pattern, but there 
was no place where he’d fit. 

Perhaps, after all, he was no 
more than what he seemed — a 
flitting dilettante with a passion for 



a lonely eating-out-of-doors and an 
addiction to the bottle. 

Yet he knew the native lan- 
guage and he had said he came 
here often and that in itself was 
more than merely strange. With 
apparently the entire Galaxy in 
which to flit around, why should 
he gravitate to Garson IV, which, 
to the human eye, at least, was a 
most unprepossessing planet? 

And another thing — how had he 
gotten here? 

“Gideon,” asked Sheridan, “did 
you see, by any chance, any sort 
of conveyance parked nearby that 
our friend could have traveled in?” 

Gideon shook his head. “Now 
that you mention it, I am sure 
there wasn’t. I would have noticed 
it.” 

“Has it occurred to you, sir,” in- 
quired Hezekiah, “that he may 
have mastered the ability of tele- 
portation? It is not impossible. 
There was that race out on 
Pilico . 

“That’s right,” said Sheridan, 
“but the Pilicoans were good for 
no more than a mile or so at a 
time. You remember how they 
went popping along, like a jack 
rabbit making mile-long jumps, but 
making them so fast that you 
couldn’t see him jump. This gent 
must have covered light-years. He 
asked me about a language that 
I never heard of. Indicated that 
it is widely spoken in at least some 
parts of the Galaxy.”

GALAXY 




“You are worrying yourself un- 
duly, sir,* cautioned Hezekiah. 
“We have more important things 
than this galivanting alien to 
trouble ourselves about” 

“You’re right,” said Sheridan. 
“If we don’t get this cargo mov- 
ing, it will be my neck.” 

But he couldn’t shake entirely 
the memory of the afternoon. 

He went back, in his mind, 
through the long and idle chatter 
and found, to his amazement, that 
it had been completely idle. So far 
as he could recall, the creature had 
told him nothing of itself. For three 
solid hours or more, it had talked 
almost continuously and in all that 
time had somehow managed to say 
exactly nothing. 

That evening, when he brought 
the supper, Napoleon squatted 
down beside the chair, gathering 
his spotless apron neatly in his 
lap. 

“We are in a bad way, aren’t 
we?” he asked. 

“Yes, I suppose you could say 
we are.” 

“What will we do, Steve, if we 
can’t move the stuff at all — if 
we can’t get any podars?" 

“Nappy,” said Sheridan, “I’ve 
been trying very hard not to think 
of it” 

But now that Napoleon had 
brought it up, he could well imagine 
the reaction of Central Trading if 
he should have to haul a billion- 
dollar cargo back intact He could 



imagine, a bit more vividly, what 
might be said to him if he simply 
left it here and went back home 
without it 

No matter how he did it, he 
had to sell the cargo! 

If he didn’t, his career was in a 
sling. 

Although there was more, he 
realized, than just his career at 
stake. The whole human race was 
involved. 

r | ''HERE was a real and pressing 
need for the tranquilizer made 
from podar tubers. A search for 
such a drug had started centuries 
before and the need of it was un- 
derlined by the fact that through 
all those centuries the search had 
never faltered. It was something 
that Man needed badly — that 
Man, in fact, had needed badly 
since the very moment he’d be- 
come something more than animal. 

And here, on this very planet, 
was the answer to that terrible 
human need — an answer denied 
and blocked by the stubbornness 
of a shiftless, dirty, backward 
people. 

“If we only had this planet,” 
he said, speaking more to himself 
than to Napoleon, “if we could 
only take it over, we could grow 
all the podars that we needed. 
We’d make it one big field and 
we’d grow a thousand times more 
podars than these natives ever 
grew.” 



NSTALLMENT PLAN

“But we can’t,” Napoleon said 
“It is against the law.” 

“Yes, Nappy, you are right. 
Very much against the law.” 

For the Garsonians were intel- 
ligent — not startingly so, but in- 
telligent, at least, within the mean- 
ing of the law. 

And you could do nothing that 
even hinted of force against an 
intelligent race. You couldn’t even 
buy or lease their land, for the 
law would rule that in buying one 
would be dispossessing them of the 
inalienable rights of all alien in- 
telligences. 

You could work with them and 
teach them — that was very laud- 
able. But the Garsonians were al- 
most unteachable. You could bar- 
ter with them if you were very 
careful that you did not cheat 
them too outrageously. But the 
Garsonians refused to barter. 

“I don’t know what we’ll do,” 
Sheridan told Napoleon. “How 
are we going to find a way?” 

“I have a sort of suggestion. If 
we could introduce these natives 
to the intricacies of dice, we might 
finally get somewhere. We robots, 
as you probably know, are very 
good at it.” 

Sheridan choked on his coffee. 
He slowly and with great care set 
the cup down. 

“Ordinarily,” he told Napoleon 
solemnly, “I would frown upon 
such tactics. But with the situation 
as it stands, why don’t you get 



some of the boys together and 
have a try at it?” 

“Glad to do it, Steve.” 

“And . uh, Nappy . .” 

“Yes, Steve?” 

“I presume you’d pick the best 
crap-shooters in the bunch.” 

“Naturally,” said Napoleon, get- 
ting up and smoothing his apron. 

J OSHUA and Thaddeus took 
their troupe to a distant vil- 
lage in entirely virgin territory, 
untouched by any of the earlier 
selling efforts, and put on the 
medicine show. 

It was an unparalleled success. 
The natives rolled upon the 
ground, clutching at their bellies, 
helpless with laughter. They 
howled and gasped and wiped their 
streaming eyes. They pounded one 
another on the back in apprecia- 
tion of the jokes. They’d never 
seen anything like it in all their 
lives — there had never been any- 
thing like it on all of Garson IV. 

And while they were weak with 
merriment, while they were still 
well-pleased, at the exact psycho- 
logical moment when all their in- 
hibitions should be down and all 
stubbornness and hostility be 
stilled, Joshua made the sales pitch. 

The laughter stopped. The mer- 
riment went away. The audience 
simply stood and stared. 

The troupe packed up and came 
trailing home, deep in despondency. 
Sheridan sat in his tent and 



40 



GALAXY 




faced the bleak prospect Outside 
the tent, the base was still 
as death. There was no happy 
talk or singing and no passing 
laughter. There was no neighbor- 
ly tramping back and forth. 

“Six weeks,” Sheridan said bit- 
terly to Hezekiah. “Six weeks and 
not a sale. We’ve done everything 
we can and we’ve not come even 
close.” 

He clenched his fist and hit 
the desk. “If we could only find 
what the trouble is! They want 
our merchandise and still they re- 
fuse to buy. What is the holdup, 
Hezekiah? Can you think of any- 
thing?” 

Hezekiah shook his head. “Noth- 
ing, sir. I’m stumped. We all are.” 

“They’ll crucify me back at Cen- 
tral,” Sheridan declared. “They’ll 
nail me up and keep me as a hor- 
rible example for the next ten 
thousand years. There’ve been fail- 
ures before, but none like this.” 

“I hesitate to say this, sir,” said 
Hezekiah, “but we could take it 
on the lam. Maybe that’s the an- 
swer. The boys would go along. 
Theoretically they’re loyal to Cen- 
tral, but deep down at the bottom 
of it, it’s you they’re really loyal 
to. We could load up the cargo and 
that would give us capital and 
we’d have a good head start . 

“No,” Sheridan said firmly. 
“We’ll try a little longer and we 
may solve the situation. If not, I 
face the music.” 



He scraped his hand across his 
jaw. 

“Maybe,” he said, “Nappy and 
his crap-shooters can turn the 
trick for us. It’s fantastic, sure, but 
stranger things have happened.” 

TVT APOLEON and his pals came 
^ back, sheepish and depressed. 
“They beat the pants off us,” 
the cook told Sheridan in awe. 
“Those boys are really naturals. 
But when we tried to pay our bets, 
they wouldn’t take our stuff!” 
“We have to try to arrange a 
powwow,” said Sheridan, “and talk 
it out with them, although I hold 
little hope for it Do you think, 
Napoleon, if we came clean and 
told them what a spot we’re in, 
it would make a difference?” 

“No, I don’t,” Napoleon said. 

“If they only had a govern- 
ment,” observed Ebenezer, who 
had been a member of Napoleon’s 
gambling team, “we might get 
somewhere with a powwow. Then 
you could talk with someone who 
represented the entire population. 
But this way you’ll have to talk 
with each village separately and 
that will take forever.” 

“We can’t help it, Eb,” said 
Sheridan. “It’s all we have left.” 
But before any powwow could 
be arranged, the podar harvest 
started. The natives toiled like 
beavers in the fields, digging up 
the tubers, stacking them to dry, 
packing them in carts and hauling 



NSTALLMENT PLAN 



41 




them to the bams by sheer man- 
power, for the Garsonians had no 
draft animals. 

They dug them up and hauled 
them to the barns, the very bams 
where they'd sworn that they had 
no podars. But that was not to 
wonder at when one stopped to 
think of it, for the natives had 
also sworn that they grew no 
podars. 

They did not open the big bam 
doors, as one would have nor- 
mally expected them to do. They 
simply opened a tiny, man-size 
door set into the bigger door and 
took the podars in that way. And 
when any of the Earth party 
hove in sight, they quickly sta- 
tioned a heavy guard around the 
entire square. 

“We’d better let them be,” Abra- 
ham advised Sheridan. “If we try 
to push them, we may have trouble 
in our lap.” 

So the robots pulled back to the 
base and waited for the harvest to 
end. Finally it was finished and 
Sheridan counseled lying low for 
a few days more to give the Gar- 
sonians a chance to settle back 
to their normal routine. 

Then they went out again and 
this time Sheridan rode along, on 
one of the floaters with Abraham 
and Gideon. 

The first village they came to 
lay quiet and lazy in the sun. 
There was not a creature stirring. 

Abraham brought the floater 



down into the square and the three 
stepped off. 

The square was empty and the 
place was silent — a deep and 
deathly silence. 

QHERIDAN felt the skin crawl- 
^ ing up his back, for there was 
a stealthy, unnatural menace in 
the noiseless emptiness. 

“They may be laying for us,” 
suggested Gideon. 

“I don’t think so,” said Abra- 
ham. “Basically they are peace- 
ful.” 

They moved cautiously across 
the square and walked slowly 
down a street that opened from 
the square. 

And still there was no living 
thing in sight 

And stranger still — the doors 
of some of the houses stood open 
to the weather and the windows 
seemed to watch them out of 
blind eyes, with the colorful crude 
curtains gone. 

“Perhaps,” Gideon suggested, 
“they may have gone away to 
some harvest festival or something 
of that nature.” 

“They wouldn’t leave their 
doors wide open, even for a day,” 
declared Abraham. “I’ve lived with 
them for weeks and I’ve studied 
them. I know what they would do. 
They’d have closed the doors very 
carefully and tried them to be sure 
that they were closed.” 

“But maybe the wind . 



42 



GALAXY 




“Not a chance,” insisted Abra- 
ham. “One door, possibly. But I 
see four of them from here.” 

“Someone has to take a look,” 
said Sheridan. “It might as well be 
me.” 

He turned in at a gate where 
one of the doors stood open and 
went slowly up the path. He halted 
at the threshold and peered in. The 
room beyond was empty. He 
stepped into the house and went 
from room to room and all the 
rooms were empty — not simply 
of the natives, but of everything. 
There was no furniture and the 
utensils and the tools were gone 
from hooks and racks. There was 
no scrap of clothing. There was 
nothing left behind. The house 
was dead and bare and empty, a 
shabby and abandoned thing dis- 
carded by its people. 

He felt a sense of guilt creep 
into his soul. What if we drove 
them off? What if we hounded 
them until they’d rather flee than 
face us? 

But that was ridiculous, he told 
himself. There must be some other 
reason for this incredibly complete 
mass exodus. 

He went back down the walk. 
Abraham and Gideon went into 
other houses. All of them were 
empty. 

“It may be this village only,” 
suggested Gideon. “The rest may 
be quite normal.” 

But Gideon was wrong. 



13 ACK at the floater, they got 
in touch with base. 

“I can’t understand it,” said 
Hezekiah. “I’ve had the same re- 
port from four other teams. I was 
about to call you, sir.” 

“You’d better get out every 
floater that you can,” said Sheri- 
dan. “Check all the villages around. 
And keep a lookout for the peo- 
ple. They may be somewhere in 
the country. There’s a possibility 
they’re at a harvest festival.” 

“If they’re at a festival, sir,” 
asked Hezekiah, “why did they 
take their belongings? You don’t 
take along your furniture when 
you attend a festival.” 

“I know,” said Sheridan. “You 
put your finger on it Get the boys 
out, will you?” 

“There’s just the possibility,” 
Gideon offered, “that they are 
changing villages. Maybe there’s a 
tribal law that says they have to 
build a new village every so often. 
It might have its roots in an an- 
cient sanitation law that the camp 
must be moved at stated intervals.” 
“It could be that,” Sheridan 
said wearily. “We’ll have to wait 
and see.” 

Abraham thumbed a fist toward 
the barn. 

Sheridan hesitated, then threw 
caution to the winds. 

“Go ahead,” he said. 

Gideon stalked up the ramp and 
reached the door. He put out a 
hand and grasped one of the 



NSTALLMENT PLAN

planks nailed across the door. He 
wrenched and there was an an- 
guished shriek of tortured nails 
ripping from the wood and the 
board came free. Another plank 
came off and then another one 
and Gideon put his shoulder to the 
door and half of it swung open. 

Inside, in the dimness of the 
bam, was the dull, massive shine 
of metal — a vast machine sitting 
on the driveway floor. 

Sheridan stiffened with a cold, 
hollow sense of terror. 

It was wrong, he thought. There 
could be no machine. 

The Garsonians had no business 
having a machine. Their culture 
was entirely non-mechanical. The 
best they had achieved so far had 
been the hoe and wheel, and even 
yet they had not been able to put 
the hoe and wheel together to make 
themselves a plow. 

They had had no machine when 
the second expedition left some 
fifteen years ago, and in those fif- 
teen years they could not have 
spanned the gap. In those fifteen 
years, from all surface indications, 
they had not advanced an inch. 

And yet the machine stood in 
the driveway of the barn. 

It was a fair-sized cylinder, set 
on end and with a door in one side 
of it. The upper end of it termi- 
nated in a dome-shaped cap. Ex- 
cept for the door, it resembled very 
much a huge and snub-nosed 
bullet. 



Interference, thought Sheridan. 
There had been someone here be- 
tween the time the second expedi- 
tion left and the third one had 
arrived. 

“Gideon,” he said. 

“What is it, Steve?” 

“Go back to base and bring the 
transmog chest. Tell Hezekiah to 
get my tent and all the other stjiff 
over here as soon as he is able. 
Call some of the boys off recon- 
naissance. We have work to do.” 
There had been someone here, 
he thought — and most certainly 
there had. A very urbane creature 
who sat beneath a tree beside a 
spread-out picnic cloth, swigging at 
his jug and talking for three solid 
hours without saying anything at 
all! 

V 

T HE messenger from Central 
Trading brought his small 
ship down to one side of the village 
square, not far from where Sheri- 
dan’s tent was pitched. He slid 
back the visi-dome and climbed 
out of his seat 

He stood for a moment, shining 
in the sun, during which he straight- 
ened his special courier badge, 
which had become askew upon his 
metal chest Then he walked de- 
liberately toward the barn, heading 
for Sheridan, who sat upon the 
ramp. 

“You are Sheridan?” he asked. 



44 



GALAXY 




Sheridan nodded, looking him 
over. He was a splendid thing. 

“I had trouble finding you. Your 
base seems to be deserted.” 

“We ran into some difficulty,” 
Sheridan said quietly. 

“Not too serious, I trust I see 
your cargo is untouched.” 

“Let me put it this way — we 
haven’t been bored.” 

“I see,” the robot said, disap- 
pointed that an explanation was 
not immediately forthcoming. “My 
name is Tobias and I have a mes- 
sage for you.” 

“I’m listening.” 

SOMETIMES, Sheridan told 
himself, these headquarters ro- 
bots needed taking down a peg or 
two. 

“It is a verbal message. I can 
assure you that I am thoroughly 
briefed. I can answer any ques- 
tions you may wish to ask.” 

“Please,” said Sheridan. “The 
message first” 

“Central Trading wishes to in- 
form you that they have been 
offered the drug calenthropodensia 
in virtually unlimited supply by' a 
firm which describes itself as Gal- 
actic Enterprises. We would like to 
know if you can shed any light 
upon the matter.” 

“Galactic Enterprises,” said Sher- 
idan. “I’ve never heard of them.” 
“Neither has Central Trading. 
I don’t mind telling you that we’re 
considerably upset.” 



“I should imagine you would 
be.” 

Tobias squared his shoulders. “I 
have been instructed to point out 
to you that you were sent to Garson 
IV to obtain a cargo of podara, 
from which this drug is made, and 
that the assignment, in view of the 
preliminary work already done 
upon the planet, should not have 
been so difficult that — ” 

“Now, now,” cautioned Sheri- 
dan, “Let us keep our shirts on. 
If it will quiet your conscience 
any, you may consider for the rec- 
ord that I have accepted the bawl- 
ing out you’re supposed to give 
me.” 

“But you — ” 

“I assume,” said Sheridan, “that 
Galactic Enterprises is quoting a 
good stiff price on this drug of 
theirs.” 

“It’s highway robbery. What 
Central Trading has sent me to 
find out—” 

“Is whether I am going to bring 
in a cargo of podars. At the mo- 
ment, I can’t tell you.” 

“But I must take back my re- 
port!” 

“Not right now, you aren’t I 
won’t be able to make a report to 
you for several days at least You’ll 
have to wait.” 

“But my instructions are—” 

“Suit yourself,” Sheridan said 
sharply. “Wait for it or go back 
without it. I don’t give a damn 
which you do.”

got up from the ramp and 
walked into the bam. 

The robots, he saw, had finally 
pried or otherwise dislodged the 
cap from the big machine and had 
it on the side on the driveway floor, 
tilted to reveal the innards of it 
“Steve,” said Abraham bitterly, 
“take a look at it” 

Sheridan took a look. The inside 
of the cap was a mass of fused 
metal. 

“There were some working parts 
in there,” said Gideon, “but they 
have been destroyed” 

Sheridan scratched his head. 
“Deliberately? A self-destruction 
relay?” 

Abraham nodded. “They appar- 
ently were all finished with it If 
we hadn’t been here, I suppose 
they would have carted this ma- 
chine and the rest of them back 
home, wherever that may be. But 
they couldn’t take a chance of one 
of them falling in our hands. So 
they pressed the button or what- 
ever they had to do and the entire 
works went pouf.” 

“But there are other machines. 
Apparently one in every bam.” 
“Probably just the same as this,” 
said Lemuel, rising from his knees 
beside the cap. 

“What’s your guess?” asked 
Sheridan. 

“A matter transference machine, 
a teleporter, whatever you want to 
call it,” Abraham told him. “Not 
deduced, of course, from anything 



in the machine itself, but from the 
circumstances. Look at this bam. 
There’s not a podar in it. Those 
podars went somewhere. This pic- 
nicking friend of yours—” 

“They call themselves,” said 
Sheridan, “Galactic Enterprises. A 
messenger just arrived. He says 
they offered Central Trading a 
deal on the podar drug.” 

“And now Central Trading,” 
Abraham supplied, “enormously 
embarrassed and financially out- 
raged, will pin the blame on us 
because we’ve delivered not a 
podar .” 

“I have no doubt of it,” said 
Sheridan. “It all depends upon 
whether or not we can locate these 
native friends of ours.” 

“I would think that most un- 
likely,” Gideon said. “Our recon- 
naissance showed all the villages 
empty throughout the entire planet 
Do you suppose they might have 
left in these machines? If they’d 
transport podars, they’d probably 
transport people.” 

“Perhaps,” said Lemuel, making 
a feeble joke, “everything that be- 
gins with the letter p.” 

“What are the chances of finding 
how they work?” asked Sheridan. 
“This is something that Central 
could make a lot of use of.” 

A BRAHAM shook his head. “I 
can’t tell you, Steve. Out of 
all these machines on the planet, 
which amounts to one in every 




46 



GALAXY 




barn, there is a certain mathemati- 
cal chance that we might find one 
that was not destroyed” 

“But even if we did,” said 
Gideon, “there is an excellent 
chance that it would immediately 
destroy itself if we tried to tamper 
with it.” 

“And if we don’t find one that 
is not destroyed?” 

“There is a chance,” Lemuel ad- 
mitted. “All of them would not 
destroy themselves to the same de- 
gree, of course. Nor would the 
pattern of destruction always be 
the same. From, say, a thousand 
of them, you might be able to 
work out a good idea of what kind 
of machinery there was in the 
cone.” 

“And say we could find out 
what kind of machinery was 
there?” 

“That’s a hard one to answer, 
Steve,” Abraham said. “Even if we 
had one complete and -functioning, 
I honestly don’t know if we could 
ferret out the principle to the point 
where we could duplicate it. You 
must remember that at no time 
has the human race come even 
close to something of this nature.” 
It made a withering sort of 
sense to Sheridan. Seeing a totally 
unfamiliar device work, even hav- 
ing it blueprinted in exact detail, 
would convey nothing whatever if 
the theoretical basis was missing. 
It was, completely, and there was 
a great deal less available here 



than a blueprint or even working 
model. 

“They used those machines to 
transport the podars,” he said, “and 
possibly to transport the people. 
And if that is true, it must be the 
people went voluntarily — we’d 
have known if there was force in- 
volved. Abe, can you tell me: Why 
would the people go?” 

“I wouldn’t know,” said Abra- 
ham. “All I have now is a physicist 
transmog. Give me one on soci- 
ology and I’ll wrestle with the 
problem.” 

There was a shout outside the 
barn and they whirled toward 
the door. Ebenezer was coming 
up the ramp and in his arms he 
carried a tiny, dangling form. 

“It’s one of them,” gasped Gide- 
on. “It’s a native, sure enough!” 

Ebenezer knelt and placed the 
little native tenderly on the floor. 
“I found him in the field. He was 
lying in a ditch. I’m afraid he’s 
done for.” 

Sheridan stepped forward and 
bent above the native. It was an 
old man — any one of the thou- 
sands of old men he’d seen in the 
villages. The same leathery old 
face with the wind and weather 
wrinkles in it, the same shaggy 
brows shielding deep-sunk eyes, 
the same scraggly crop of whiskers, 
the same sense of forgotten shift- 
lessness and driven stubbornness. 

“Left behind,” said Ebenezer. 
“Left behind when all the others

went. He must have fallen sick out 
in the field ...” 

“Get my canteen,” Sheridan 
said. “It's hanging by the door.” 

TP HE oldster opened his eyes 
and glanced around the circle 
of faces that stared down at him. 
He rubbed a hand across his face, 
leaving streaks of dirt. 

“I fell he mumbled. “I remem- 
ber falling. I fell into a ditch.” 

“Here's the water, Steve,” said 
Abraham. 

Sheridan took it, lifted the old 
man and held him half upright 
against his chest. He tilted the 
canteen to the native’s lips. The 
oldster drank unneatly, gulping at 
the water. Some of it spilled, 
splashing down his whiskers to 
drip onto his belly. 

Sheridan took the canteen away. 

“Thank you,” the native said 
and, Sheridan reflected, that was 
the first civil word to come their 
way from any of the natives. 

The native rubbed his face again 
with a dirty claw. “The people all 
are gone?” 

“All gone,” said Sheridan. 

“Too late,” the old man said. “I 
would have made it if I hadn't 
fallen down. Perhaps they hunted 
for me ...” His voice trailed off 
into nothingness. 

“If you don’t mind, sir,” sug- 
gested Hezekiah, “I’ll get a medic 
transmog.” 

“Perhaps you should” said 



48 



GALAXY 




Sheridan. “Although I doubt it’ll 
do much good. He should have 
died days ago out there in the 
field.” 

“Steve,” said Gideon, speaking 
softly, “a human doctor isn’t too 
much use treating alien people. In 
time, if we had the time, we could 
find out about this fellow — some- 
thing about his body chemistry 
and his metabolism. Then we could 
doctor him.” 

“That’s right, Steve,” Abraham 
said. 

Sheridan shrugged. “All right 
then, Hezekiah. Forget about the 
transmog.” 

He laid the old man back on 
the floor again and got up off his 
knees. He sat on his heels and 
rocked slowly back and forth. 

“Perhaps,” he said to the native, 
“you’ll answer one question. Where 
did all your people go?” 

“In there,” the native said, rais- 
ing a feeble arm to point at the 
machine. “In there, and then they 
went away just as the harvest we 
gathered did.” 

Sheridan stayed squatting on the 
floor beside the stricken native. 

Reuben brought in an armload 
of grass and wadded it beneath the 
native’s head as a sort of pillow. 

S O the Garsonians had really 
gone away, Sheridan told him- 
self, had up and left the planet. 
Had left it, using the machines 
that had been used to make deliv- 



ery of the podars. And if Galactic 
Enterprises had machines like that, 
then they (whoever, wherever they 
might be) had a tremendous edge 
on Central Trading. For Central 
Trading’s lumbering cargo sleds, 
snaking their laborious way across 
th^ light-years, could offer only 
feeble competition to machines like 
those. 

He had thought, he remem- 
bered, the first day they had land- 
ed, that a little competition was 
exactly what Central Trading 
needed. And here was that coftipe- 
tition — a competition that had not 
a hint of ethics. A competition that 
sneaked in behind Central Trad- 
ing’s back and grabbed the market 
that Central Trading needed — the 
market that Central could have 
cinched if it had not fooled around, 
if it had not been so sly and cyni- 
cal about adapting the podar crop 
to Earth. 

Just where and how, he wond- 
ered, had Galactic Enterprise^ 
found out about the podars and 
the importance of the drug? Under 
what circumstances had they 
learned the exact time limit during 
which they could operate in the 
podar market without Central in- 
terference? And had they, perhaps, 
been slightly optimistic in regard 
to that time limit and gotten caught 
in a situation where they had been 
forced to destroy all those beauti- 
ful machines? 

Sheridan chuckled quietly to 



50 



GALAXY 




himself. That destruction must 
have hurt them! 

It wasn’t hard, however, to im- 
agine a 'hundred or a thousand 
ways in which they might have 
learned about the podar situation, 
for they were a charming people 
and really quite disarming. He 
would not be surprised if some of 
them might be operating secretly 
inside of Central Trading. 

The native stirred. He reached 
out a skinny hand and tugged at 
the sleeve of Sheridan’s jacket. 
“Yes, what is it, friend?” 

“You will stay with me?” the 
native begged. “These others here, 
they are not the same as you and 

L" 

“I will stay with you,” Sheridan 
promised. 

“I think we’d better go,” said 
Gideon. “Maybe we disturb him.” 
The robots walked quietly from 
the barn and left the two alone. 

"DEACHING out, Sheridan put 
a hand on the native’s brow. 
The flesh was clammy cold. 

“Old friend,” he said, “I think 
perhaps you owe me something.” 
The old man shook his head, 
rolling it slowly back and forth 
upon the pillow. And the fierce 
light of stubbornness and a certain 
slyness came into his eyes. 

“We don’t owe you,” he said. 
“We owed the other ones.” 

And that, of course, hadn’t been 
what Sheridan had meant. 



But there they lay — the words 
that told the story, the solution to 
the puzzle that was Garson IV. 

“That was why you wouldn’t 
trade with us,” said Sheridan, talk- 
ing to himself rather than to the 
old native on the floor. “You were 
so deep in debt to these other 
people that you needed all the 
podar s to pay off what you owed 
them?” 

And that must have been the 
way it was. Now that he thought 
back on it, that supplied the onq 
logical explanation for everything 
that happened. The reaction of the 
natives, the almost desperate sales 
resistance was exactly the kind of 
thing one would expect from peo- 
ple in debt up to their ears. 

That was the reason, too, the 
houses had been so neglected and 
the clothes had been in rags. It 
accounted for the change from the 
happy-go-lucky shiftlessness to thq 
beaten and defeated and driven 
attitude. So pushed, so hounded, so 
fearful that they could not meet 
the payments on the debt that they 
strained their every resource, drove 
themselves to ever harder work, 
squezing from the soil every podar 
they could grow. 

“That was it?” he demanded 
sharply. “That was the way it 
was?” 

The native nodded with reluc- 
tance. 

“They came along and offered 
such a bargain that you could not 



INSTALLMENT PLAN 



51 




turn it down. For the machines, 
perhaps? For the machines to send 
you to other places?” 

The native shook his head. “No, 
not the machines. We put the 
podars in the machines and the 
podars went away. That' was how 
we paid.” 

“You were paying all these 
years?” 

“That is right,” the native said. 
Then he added, with a flash of 
pride : “But now we’re all paid up.” 

“That is fine,” said Sheridan. “It 
is good for a man to pay his debts.” 

“They took three years off the 
payments,” said the native eagerly. 
“Was that not good of them?” 

“I’m sure it was,” said Sheridan, 
with some bitterness. 

He squatted patiently on the 
floor, listening to the faint whispeif 
of a wind blowing in the loft and 
the rasping breath of the dying 
native. 

“But then your people used the 
machines to go away. Can’t you 
tell me why?” 

A racking cough shook the old 
man and his breath came in gasp- 
ing sobs. 

Sheridan felt a sense of shame 
in what he had to do. I should let 
him die in peace, he thought. I 
should not badger him. I should let 
him go in whatever dignity he can 
— not pushed and questioned to 
the final breath he draws. 

But there was that last answer— 
the one Sheridan had to have. 



S HERIDAN said gently: “But 
tell me, friend, what did you 
bargain for? What was it that you 
bought?” 

He wondered if the native heard. 
There was no indication that he 
had. 

“What did you buy?” Sheridan 
insisted. 

“A planet,” said the native. 

“But you had a planet!” 

“This one was different,” the 
native told him in a feeble whisper. 
“This was a planet of immortality. 
Anyone who went there would 
never, never die.” 

Sheridan squatted stiffly in 
shocked and outraged silence. 

And from the silence came a 
whisper — a whisper still of faith 
and belief and pity that would 
haunt the human all his life. 

“That was what I lost,” the 
whisper said. “That was what I 
lost . .” 

Sheridan opened his hands and 
closed them, strangling the perfect 
throat and the winning smile, shut- 
ting off the cultured flow of words. 

If I had him now, he thought, 
if I only had him now! 

He remembered the spead-out 
picnic cloth and the ornate jug and 
the appetizing food, the smooth, 
slick gab and the assurance of the 
creature. And even the methodical 
business of getting very drunk so 
that their meeting could end with- 
out unpleasant questions or undue 
suspicion. 



52 



GALAXY 




And the superior way in which 
he’d asked if the human might 
know Bailie, all the time, more 
than likely, being able to speak 
English himself. 

So Central Trading finally had 
its competition. From this moment, 
Central Trading would be fighting 
with its back against the wall. For 
these jokers in Galactic Enter- 
prises played dirty and for keeps. 

The Garsonians had been naive 
fools, of course, but that was no 
true measure of Galactic Enter- 
prises. They undoubtedly would 
select different kinds of bait for 
different kinds of fish, but the old 
never-never business of immortal- 
ity might be deadly bait for even 
the most sophisticated if appropri- 
ately presented. 

An utter lack of ethics and the 
transference machines were the 
trumps Galactic held. 

Vtf/’HAT had really happened, he 
” wondered, to all the people 
who had lived on this planet? 
Where had they really gone when 
they followed the podars into 
those machines? 

Could the Galactic boys, by 
chance, have ferreted out a place 
where there would be a market for 
several million slaves? 

Or had they simply planned to 
get the Garsonians out of the way 
as an effective means of cutting off 
the podar supply for Central Trad- 
ing, thus insuring a ready and pro- 



fitable sale for their supply of 
drugs? 

Or had they lured the Garsoni- 
ans away so they themselves could 
take over the planet? 

And if that was the case — per- 
haps in any case — Galactic Enter- 
prises defintely had lost this first 
encounter. Maybe, Sheridan told 
himself, they are really not so hot 

They gave us exactly what we 
need, he realized with a pleased 
jolt. They did us a favor! 

Old blundering, pompous Cen- 
tral Trading had won the first 
round, after all. 

He got to his feet and headed 
for the door. 

He hesitated and turned back to 
the native. 

“Maybe, friend,” he said, “you 
were the lucky one.” 

The native did not hear him. 

Gideon was waiting at the door. 

“How is he?” he asked. 

“’He’s dead,” Sheridan said. “I 
wonder if you’d arrange for burial.” 

“Of course,” said Gideon. “You’ll 
let me see the data. I’ll have to 
bone up on the proper rites.” 

“But first do something else for 
me.” 

“Name it, Steve.” 

“You know this Tobias, the mes- 
senger that Central Trading sent? 
Find him and see that he doesn’t 
leave.” 

Gideon grinned. “You may rest 
assured.” 

“Thank you,” said Sheridan. 



NSTALLMENT PLAN

On his way to the tent, he passed 
the courier’s ship. It was, he noted, 
a job that was built for speed — 
little more than an instrument 
board and seat tacked onto a pow- 
erful engine. 

In a ship like that, he thought, 
a pilot could really make some 
time. 

Almost to the tent, he met Heze- 
kiah. 

“Come along with me,” he said. 
“I have a job for you.” 

TNSIDE the tent, he sat down in 
**• his chair and reached for a 
sheet of paper. 

“Hezekiah,” he said, “dig into 
that chest. Find the finest diplo- 
matic transmog that we have.” 

“I know just where it is, sir,” 
said Hezekiah, pawing through the 
chest 

He came out with the transmog 
and laid it on the desk. 

“Hezekiah,” said Sheridan, “lis- 
ten to me carefully. Remember 
every word I say.” 

“Sir,” replied Hezekiah, a little 
huffily, “I always listen carefully.” 

“I know you do. I have perfect 
faith and trust in you. That is why 
Fm sending you to Central.” 

“To Central, sir! You must be 
joking, surely. You know I cannot 
go. Sir, who would look after you? 
Who would see that you—” 

“I can get along all right. You’ll 
be coming back. And I’ll still have 
Napoleon.” 



“But I don’t want to go, sir!” 

“Hezekiah, I must have someone 
I can trust We’ll put that transmog 
in you and—” 

“But it will take me weeks, sir!” 

“Not with the courier ship. 
You’re going back instead of the 
courier. I’ll write an authorization 
for you to represent me. It’ll be 
as if I were there myself.” 

“But there is Abraham. Or 
Gideon. Or you could send any of 
the others . ” 

“It’s you, Hezekiah. You are my 
oldest friend.” 

“Sir,” said Hezekiah, straighten- 
ing to attention, “what do you wish 
me to do?” 

“You’re to tell Central that Gar- 
son IV is now uninhabited. You’re 
to say that such being the case, I’m 
possessing it formally in the name 
of Central Trading. Tell them Fll 
need reinforcements immediately 
because there is a possibility that 
Galactic Enterprises may try to 
take it from us. They’re to send 
out one sled loaded with robots as 
an initial occupying and colonizing 
force, and another sledload of agri- 
cultural implements so we can start 
our farming. And every last podar 
that they have, for seed. And, 
Hezekiah . 

“Yes, sir?” 

“That sledload of robots. They’d 
better be deactivated and knocked 
down. That way they can pile on 
more of them. We can assemble 
them here.” 



54 



GALAXY 




Hezekiah repressed a shudder. 
“I will tell them, sir.” 

“I am sorry, Hezekiah.” 

“It is quite all right, sir.” 
Sheridan finished writing out the 
authorization. 

“Tell Central Trading,” he said, 
“that in time we’ll turn this entire 
planet into one vast podar field. 
But they must not waste a minute. 
No committee sessions, no meet- 
ings of the board, no dawdling 
around. Keep right on their tail 
every blessed second.” 

“I will not let them rest, sir,” 
Hezekiah assured him. 

VI 

HP HE courier ship had disap- 
peared from sight. Try as he 
might, Sheridan could catch no 
further glimpse of it. 

Good old Hezekiah, he thought, 
hell do the job. Central Trading 
will be wondering for weeks ex- 
actly what it was that hit them. 

He tilted his head forward and 
nibbed his aching neck. 

He said to Gideon and Eben- 
ezer: “You can get up off him 
now” 

The two arose, grinning, from 
the prostrate form of Tobias. 
Tobias got up, outraged. “You’ll 



hear of this,” he said to Sheridan. 

“Yes, I know,” said Sheridan. 
“You hate my guts.” 

Abraham stepped forward, 
“What is next?” he asked. 

“Well,” Sheridan said, “I think 
we should all turn gleaners.” 
“Gleaners?” 

“There are bound to be some 
podars that the natives missed. 
We’ll need every one we can find 
for seed.” 

“But we’re all physicists and 
mechanical engineers and chemists 
and other things like that. Surely 
you would not expect such distin- 
guished specialists—” 

“I think I can remedy that,” 
said Sheridan. “I imagine we still 
can find those spacehand trans- 
mogs. They should serve until Cen- 
tral sends us some farmer units.” 
Tobias stepped forward and 
ranged himself alongside of Abra- 
ham. “As long as I must remain 
here, I demand to be of use. It’s 
not in a robot’s nature just to loaf 
around.” 

Sheridan slapped his hand 
against his jacket pocket, felt the 
bulge of the transmog he’d taken 
out of Hezekiah. 

“I think,” he told Tobias, “I 
have just the thing for you.”

Pastoral Affair 

By CHARLES A. STEARNS 

No wonder StefcrnHc meant to 
tight to the last — lie wasn't 
going to turn his kids over 
to an old goat like Glinka l 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



T HE seaplane cast its silhou- 
ette from aloft upon the 
blue Arabian Sea, left its 
white wake across the shallows, and 
taxied alongside the ancient stone 
jetty, clawing into the sandy bottom 
with its small fore and after an- 
chors. 

Colonel Glinka stepped out upon 
the wing, carefully measured the 
distance to the jetty, and sprang for 
it, wetting himself up to the seat 
of his voluminous khaki shorts. 



This lonely sandspit, these bar- 
ren slopes and frowning, ocher cliffs, 
the oceanic silence around him, 
broken by the plaintive cries of 
wheeling Caspian terns that were 
badly in need of laundering, were 
not, he thought as he clambered 
ashore, exactly as one pictures a 
tropical paradise. 

And it helped the desolation of 
his mood not at all that upon these 
same arid ridges scores of silent, 
bumoosed figures watched him as 



56 



GALAXY 




he stood there, allowing the water 
to drain from his perforated white 
oxfords and all unaware that his 
vast pith helmet, curiously heavy 
malacca cane and formidable fun- 
dament cast a centaur’s shadow 
upon the rocks in the later after- 
noon sun. 

Colonel Glinka took a pair of 
green sun goggles from his pocket 
and put them on, resolutely hitched 
up his shorts, assumed the stem yet 
conciliatory expression of a hedge- 
hog in mating season, and set off 
up the rocky path. 

Ahead of him, the bumoosed 
ones scrambled nimbly up the 
slope, looking over their shoulders, 
intent upon not missing a thing, yet 
endeavoring to keep their distance. 
But two there had been who either 
had not seen him arrive, or did not 
give a damn, for they suddenly ap- 
peared upon the rise before him, 
racing down toward the sea with 
very little regard for life or limb. 

T N the lead, a brown young man 

in flying green turban and white 
duck trousers appeared to be losing 
steadily to his pursuer, who, though 
swathed from head to food in that 
featureless native garb of the others, 
might yet be identified by subtle 
conformations as a female. 

Both of them stopped at once 
upon sighting Colonel Glinka in the 
pathway, the female hurriedly re- 
treating to what might be deemed 
a safer distance, the young man 



standing as if petrified, with one 
foot upraised and a sun-snarl upon 
his mottled face, quivering at point 
“Oh, Effendi ,” he cried at last 
“if you are looking for Aden, then 
you are lost for Aden is five hun- 
dred miles that way. And if you are 
looking for Cairo — ” 

“I am hardly ever lost” Colonel 
Glinka said, and, eying the young 
female, added, ^Tell me, what is 
the name of that rather tasteless 
game that you are playing?” 

“No game, Effendi,” the brown 
young man said. “That one chases 
me every time I go outside. They 
are worse than Tuaregs, these 
people.” 

“Are you not a native, then?” 
“I?” The young man placed a 
hand of scorn upon his breast. 
“Hadji Abdul Hakkim ben Sala- 
zar? I am Saudi, and a Hadj be- 
sides. Say, Joe, have you got an 
American cigarette?” 

“A great deal better than that,” 
Colonel Glinka said, proffering an 
ornate golden cigarette case. “Try 
one of these, my boy.” 

Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar took 
two, sniffing them suspiciously. 
“They are very brown,” he said. 

Less critically, Colonel Glinka 
lighted one for himself. “You know,” 
he said, “I was rather hoping that 
you might direct me to the house 
of a very old friend of mine.” 
“What handle?” 

“I cannot tell you what name he 
is presently affecting, but he is a 



PASTORAL AFFAIR 



57 




small, crooked man with a heavy 
black beard — or, at any rate, he 
once had such a beard. I know that 
he is somewhere on this island; 
therefore it will be useless for you 
to lie to me” 

“Ah, that is the Sidi Doctor Ste- 
phens,” Abdul said, puffing not too 
happily upon his cigarette. “His is 
the only house upon this island; 
also, I am his flunky and so I ought 
to know.” 

“ ‘Stephens’ will do,” said Colonel 
Glinka, thwacking him smartly 
with the Malacca cane. “Lead on. 
And you may dispense with the 
gutter American dialect. I am not 
American, and besides I speak 
Arabic fluently.” 

“But I not so well,” Abdul said, 
“for I was raised in the Kuwait oil- 
fields.” 

“By whom? A camel breeder?” 

“Socony Vacuum,” Abdul said. 

They toiled up the face of the 
cliff. At once, half a dozen of the 
white-robed gallery fell in behind 
them. When Colonel Glinka 
stopped and looked back, they 
stopped. When he continued upon 
his way, they continued. 

“Have they no homes to which to 
go?” he complained. “Have they 
nothing to do?” 

“They are a very backward 
people, who live in the open,” Abdul 
said. “They do not work.” 

“How, then, do the wretches live? 
Wall Street charity, I presume.” 

“Oh, no, when they are not able 



to forage, the Sidi Doctor Stephens 
feeds them.” 

“The reactionary old fool! But 
you may be sure that they knew 
how to work in the old days, before 
he came.” 

“I do not think so.” 

“And why, in your ageless wis- 
dom, not?” 

“Because the Sidi Doctor made 
them,” Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar 
said. 

OLONEL Glinka did not reply, 
^ for they had reached the sum- 
mit of the path by this time and 
were looking down upon a small, 
white villa that nestled in a green 
microcosm between the naked 
chines of the dark, interior hills. A 
miniature Eden indeed, thought 
Colonel Glinka, of figs and cinna- 
mons, of date palms and patchouli, 
all enclosed within a high wire 
fence. 

They descended, and Abdul 
Hakkim ben Salazar, with a flour- 
ish, produced a great bronze key 
and unlocked the iron gate. “The 
Sidi Doctor,” he said, “will doubt- 
less be in his conservatory, making 
flowers.” 

“A godlike pastime,” said Colonel 
Glinka with heavy irony. “And 
where may this hotbed of new life 
be found?” 

“Over there,” Abdul said, point- 
ing toward a narrow, screened, 
quonsetlike annex which protruded 
from the rear of the villa. “Come 



58 



GALAXY 




with me and I will show you” 
“You will not,” Colonel Glinka 
said, smiting him upon the thigh 
once again with the heavy cane. 
“You will remain here and keep 
silent” 

“Ouchdammit!” Abdul ex- 
claimed. “You be careful with that 
thing, Joe, okay?” 

“ You be careful, my boy,” 
Colonel Glinka said and marched 
swiftly around the comer of the 
house, opened the screen door of 
the conservatory, and entered. 

Here, amid long, terraced rows 
of tropical plants, a bearded dwarf 
in a green coat crouched before an 
earthen tray of lilies of the valley, 
tranquilly puffing up a massive, to- 
bacco-stained meerschaum. He did 
not look up at the sound of the in- 
truder, for he was engaged in a del- 
icate business, the transfer of pollen 
from corolla to corolla with a tooth- 
pick. 

“So you, are, after all, only a 
minor god,” Colonel Glinka said. 

“I heard your plane and I 
watched you come up the path,” 
the black bearded little man said. 
“Glinka, is it not?” 

“You remembered me!” Colonel 
Glinka, quite affectedly, removed 
his goggles and dabbed at his eye 
with a perfumed handkerchief. “A 
humble policeman, a fat little no- 
body, to be remembered by the 
great Dr. Stefanik who was once 
our greatest scientist — yes, our 
most brilliant geneticist — do not 



shake your head. Let me see, was 
it Ankara where last we met? Yes, 
eight years ago in Ankara. You got 
away from me in Ankara. I was so 
ashamed, Comrade, that I cried ” 

“Nine years,” the other corrected. 
“For one remembers a mad dog. 
And do not call me ‘comrade,’ Com- 
rade. You know that I was never 
anything other than a simple Cos- 
sack.” 

“And, as such, invariably trouble- 
some to us,” Colonel Glinka said. 
“Yet you were our white hope, 
Comrade Stefanik. We might have 
led the world, I am told, in organics 
as we now lead in physics. I have 
read all of your books upon the 
fascinating subject of chromosomic 
change and the morphology of rats. 
It was required reading for those 
of us who were assigned to you. 
Most interesting, though I confess 
I did not understand all of it.” 

V\R. STEFANIK got slowly to 
his feet. His back was now re- 
vealed to be so cruelly deformed 
that his black beard curled against 
his smock, and he walked with a 
shuffling, crablike motion as he 
limped over to pick up a small rub- 
ber irrigation hose. 

“Why did you leave us, Comrade 
Stefanik?” asked Colonel Glinka. 
“Why shame us, discredit your 
government, by running away?” 

“I did not like it there,” Dr. 
Stefanik said. 

“We knew, of course, that you

were on the verge of some great dis- 
covery, some new process, perhaps, 
of controlling human development. 
A genetical means, our biologists 
tell me, which might have made us 
all supermen, tall and brilliant, and 
immune to disease. A race of Pav- 
lovs and Stakhanovs. Do you deny 
this?” 

Dr. Stefanik merely sucked upon 
his pipe calmly, twisted a valve half 
hidden in the greenery. A spray of 
brilliant green liquid emerged from 
the nozzle of the hose, bathing the 
plants in a gentle emerald mist. 

“It is true,” he said at last, “that 
I had experimented in those days 
with a new process of alloploidy.” 
“And what is that?” 

“Alloploidy is the manipulation 
of chromosomic patterns which al- 
lows us to superimpose the charac- 
ter of our most perfect specimens 
upon those of less fortunate heredi- 
tary traits within the species.” 

“I see,” said Colonel Glinka, who 
had not really quite seen. “Exactly. 
A super-race, to rule the world. 
Imagine, Comrade!” 

“Only super-rats and the like,” 
Dr. Stefanik told him calmly, “for 
you may go home and tell them that 
I have never seen fit to experiment 
with human beings, Glinka, and I 
never will.” 

“7 tell them that?” Colonel 
Glinka cried. “Would I dare? Oh, 
no, you must tell them yourself. 
That is why you will have to return 
with me.” 



“Never!” 

Colonel Glinka sighed prodi- 
giously. “I am afraid that our coun- 
try is going to be dogs-in-the- 
manger in this matter,” he said. 
“You see, we are a jealous people - 
by nature, and if we cannot have 
you, no one shall.” And, deliberate- 
ly, he laid the Malacca cane across 
his left arm, so that its tip was 
pointed squarely at Dr. Stefanik 
and the sinister round hole there 
clearly revealed to him. 

“How melodramatic that is,” Dr. 
Stefanik said. 

“I know it,” said Colonel Glinka, 
“but you must remember that the 
customs officials in this part of the 
world are exceedingly tiresome 
about firearms. This little gem, now, 
is quite discreet, and very accurate, 
and it will shoot you three times 
before you can say ‘Never? Will 
you not change your mind?” 

“No.” 

“I did so want to become tall and 
brilliant,” Colonel Glinka said re- 
gretfully, and he started to press 
the handle of the cane. 

“We are as tall as we stand,” said 
Dr. Stefanik, and, swiftly focusing 
the nozzle of the irrigation hose to 
a thin stream, squirted the stinging 
green fluid in Colonel Glinka’s right 
and left eye. 

66 T know that you are in here 
somewhere!” Colonel Glinka 
yelped. “Be assured that I shall find 
you, Comrade, and when I do, it

61 




will not be pleasant for you! Oh, 
my — no, indeed!” 

His eyes were red and streaming. 
He wiped them with the lavender- 
scented handkerchief, got down 
upon his hands and knees and 
started to crawl along the terraced 
rows of tropical plants, looking 
under each bench as he came to it. 
When he had reached the end, he 
turned and crawled up the other 
side. 

At the far end of the conserva- 
tory, he stood up with a baffled 
grunt. “I know that you are in here,” 
he said. 

Something tickled the back of his 
neck. He whirled like a Dervish, 
but found only a drooping, blood- 
red plant like nothing ever created 
by nature confronting him. 

“I am getting jumpy,” Colonel 
Glinka growled. “A little jumpy in 
my business is good, but too much 
is bad for the health.” And he went, 
straightway, and closed the back 
door of the conservatory and 
dragged a heavy rack of trailing 
orchids in front of it, humming a 
furious little march from The 
Guardsman as he worked. 

“You must know,” he said loudly, 
“that I do not altogether believe 
you, Stefanik, when you imply that 
you have abandoned this research. 
Nor will they. For who, then, are 
these degenerate wretches who 
stand upon the hills and gawk at 
us, and why must you feed them? 
I know that they were not created 



by you, but it is possible that they 
are paid to be your guinea pigs. 
Perhaps you are all in the pay of 
the British. Am I right?” 

He listened. There was no an- 
swer. 

Completing his examination of 
the conservatory, he entered the 
main villa and searched it thorough- 
ly, as he had been trained to do, 
looking in every cupboard and 
closet and under the beds. 

When he had exhausted these 
hiding places, he left by the front 
door and closed it after him, with 
a narrow, jamming wedge that he 
had made of half a lead pencil. 

There were many places to hide 
in the garden, but Colonel Glinka 
took them one by one, glancing 
behind him from time to time in 
order to make certain that he was 
not being followed around and 
around the house in a grim sort of 
Maypole dance. 

“I know that you are out here, 
Comrade,” he said. 

Presently he had arrived back 
where he had started, sweating pro- 
fusely, and was about to retrace 
the entire circuit when he caught a 
glimpse of something moving in 
the undergrowth of patchouli near 
the gate. He aimed the Malacca 
cane and pressed a part of its handle 
with his thumb. A bullet whined off 
the steel gatepost. 

“Stop there, my friend!” he com- 
manded. 

Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar slow- 



62

ly rose from the bushes with his 
hands high above his head. 

“You got me, Joe,” he said. 

'X’HE gate was wide open; Ste~ 
fanik’s route of escape now 
painfully obvious. 

Colonel Glinka stared thought- 
fully up at the darkening ridges 
where the sun set in that sanguinary 
glory observable only in these lati- 
tudes, and the dusk crept swiftly 
up from the seaward-reaching ra- 
vines. 

“So,” Colonel Glinka said. “That 
is where he has gone, thinking to 
elude me forever. But you — ” he 
waggled the cane at Abdul, who 
was already shaking his head in the 
negative — “will lead me to him. 
You know his habits, and, what is 
more, you are almost certainly fa- 
miliar with every hiding place on 
this island, since it is your whim 
to be chased all over it by the fe- 
males.” 

“Too dark, Effendi Abdul said. 
“If we go out now, they will not 
only chase us; they will catch us, 
for they are able to see very well 
in the dark.” 

“ Who will catch us?” 

“These people. They are worse 
than Tuaregs. For all I know, they 
may be descended from the Tua- 
regs, and everyone knows that a 
Tuareg would as soon cut a man’s 
throat as kiss the hem of his bur- 
noose.” 

“So now they are Tuaregs.” 



Colonel Glinka nodded, with a slow, 
ferocious smile. “Yet you have 
hinted that they are the spawn of 
Comrade Stefanik’s genius, the 
children of genetical science, 
stamped with ‘Made in the Sey- 
chelles’ upon their bottoms. Per- 
haps they were grown in the con- 
servatory, from Tuareg seed.” 
Abdul grimaced. “I do not re- 
member saying that, though some- 
times I say things that I don’t re- 
member later. Perhaps they are 
not Tuaregs, then. To tell the truth, 
they were already living here when 
I came to work for the Sidi Doctor 
Stephens, and so naturally I thought 
that he had made them, for there 
were no. people upon this island in 
the old days. Only the seabirds and 
a few wild goats, perhaps.” 

Colonel Glinka clasped his hand 
to his forehead. “Stop, stop, or I 
shall go mad!” 

Abdul Hakkim obediently sat 
down and crossed his legs, starting 
to light the second of the very bad 
cigarettes that he had cadged. 

“What are you doing?” Colonel 
Glinka said softly. 

“Nothing, Effendi.” 

“Get up! Get up and get moving, 
my boy, or make your peace with 
Allah! Did you suppose for one mo- 
ment that I had forgotten what we 
were talking about?” 

TT was quite dark by the time 
they had reached the summit of 
the ridge, but Colonel Glinka still 



PASTORAL AFFAIR 



63 




marched along behind Abdul, high 
good humor restored, prodding him 
from time to time with the Malacca 
cane and lecturing him upon social 
equalities and other Party doctrine. 

“Are we nearly there?” he would 
interrupt himself to ask from time 
to time. 

“I do not know .” 

“Call out, then ” 

“I am afraid.” 

A savage poke with the cane, a 
war whoop from Abdul Hakkim 
ben Salazar. No answer. 

“We’ll get him,” Colonel Glinka 
would say. “Oh, my, yes.” 

But an hour had passed and still 
they had encountered no living 
thing upon the path. 

At last Abdul stopped abruptly. 
They were in a little, narrow ravine, 
high above the sea, with looming 
red cliffs all about them, and the 
booming of the surf upon the dis- 
tant, windward shore of the island 
plainly audible. 

“Why have we stopped here?” 
Colonel Glinka said, bumping into 
him. 

“Look there, Effendi!” Abdul 
whispered, gesturing toward a ledge 
not ten yards above their heads, 
where a burnoosed figure stood 
looking down upon them. 

“And there — and there — and 
there!” Abdul pointed at other little 
ledges where similar ghostly sen- 
tries stood, barely visible in the 
gloom. 

Colonel Glinka looked behind 



him and saw that there were others 
that they had passed within a very 
few feet of, standing upon every 
shelf and ledge that afforded a foot- 
hold above the trail. Dozens and 
dozens of them. 

“Maybe we had better scram out 
of here, Joe,” Abdul suggested. 

“I perceive that you are trying 
to frighten me,” Colonel Glinka 
said. “It won’t work ” 

A stone rattled behind them. 

“What was that?” Colonel Glinka 
demanded, turning around quickly. 
“Who’s there?” 

SOMETHING moved in the 
^ shadows, edging into the deeper 
shadows of the rocks. It was the 
pursuing female of earlier that after- 
noon. 

Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar, in 
deep, abdominal disgust, groaned, 

“Come here, you!” Colonel Glin- 
ka commanded. “Come on over 
here. Don’t be afraid, my little one 
— I won’t hurt you.” 

She advanced ever so little, a 
shapeless white wraith attracted by 
the syrup in his voice. He took one 
step forward. Carefully she retreat- 
ed a step. 

“Come now,” Colonel Glinka 
said. “Surely it is time that we met. 
For you may as well know that I 
am now the master of this island. 
Now and forevermore, so far as you 
are concerned, my child. Perhaps I 
may let you help me clear up a 
little of its mystery.” 



64 



GALAXY 




She kept a maddening five.or six 
feet between them, somehow. He 
could not lessen the distance with- 
out alarming her. And so he bal- 
anced himself upon the balls of his 
feet and lunged. 

She gave a little cry, stumbled 
and fell, rolling over and over into 
a dark little depression beside the 
path as he clutched at her robe. The 
garment, still in his hand, unwound 
easily, peeling her very much like 
an apple. 

“I beg your pardon,” Colonel 
Glinka said, scrambling after her 
upon his hands and knees, groping 
for her with outstretched arms. “I 
beg — ” His hand touched something 
which might have been her ankle. 
He seized it, held it for a moment, 
and then, shuddering, let it go, draw- 
ing back his hand as if it had been 
stabbed. By now the night was 
quite dark. 

Colonel Glinka scrambled to his 
feet, half instinctively raised the 
deadly Malacca cane. 

“Don’t do it, Joe!” cried Abdul, 
coming up from behind him and 
shoving him hard. 

The shot went wild, but the 
sound of it, echoing up and down 
the ravine, started an ominous, new 
sound, the growing, staccato mur- 
mur of many voices, a rattling of 
stones, a hundred different move- 
ments in the blackness. 

Colonel Glinka fired the last bul- 
let more wildly still, hurled the 
Malacca cane at them, and ran. 



A BDUL Hakkim ben Salazar, 
who had been many leaps 
ahead of him, arrived breathless at 
the front gate of the villa, opened 
it, dived through, locked it behind 
him, and threw himself upon the 
grass to catch his breath. 

There was a cheerful glow in 
the. darkness. The slight, grotesque 
figure of Dr. Stefanik and his pipe 
emerged from the shadows. 

“Ah,” Abdul breathed, “where 
were you, Sidi, when I was out there 
dying for you?” 

“Hiding up the tallest cinnamon 
tree, like a monkey,” Dr. Stefanik 
said. 

They sat there upon the grass for 
a long while in companionable 
silence, heeding the sounds of the 
night, which was balmy and infinite- 
ly peaceful. 

There came a high-pitched, long- 
drawn-out scream from somewhere 
on the ridge. 

“They got him,” Abdul said. 

“And now they will pluck him, I 
suppose,” said Dr. Stefanik. “There, 
by the way, is a thing that even I 
have never completely understood 
about them. Their insatiable curios- 
ity, of course, is a vestigial trait that 
will pass, but this other drive, I 
fear, this rather alarming passion 
that they have shown for the up- 
breeding of the species may be 
some universal of life itself that no 
man may touch or alter.” 

Down the path from the ridge, 
a small, white-robed figure came 



PASTORAL AFFAIR 



65 




running, far ahead of the others, 
bent upon her own schemes of evo- 
lution. 

Abdul crouched lower in the 
shadows. “That one makes even the 
heart of a man swell within his 
breast,” he whispered, “for she does 
not ever give up.” 

“That no man may touch,” Dr. 
Stefanik repeated, and nodded his 
shaggy head wisely. “As an idealist, 
I may have given them shoes and 
enlightenment, but I did not give 
them this, and so they are not al- 
together mine. His kind still pro- 
fesses to believe in the common 
denominator and the common level, 
seeking to drag down the few from 
their gilt palaces and haul up the 
masses from the muck. Tell me, as 
a Hadj who is, at the same time, 
undoubtedly vermin-ridden, do 
you believe in the equality of men 
— or can you honestly wish it?” 

“All of us to be Effendis?” 



“Something like that.” 

Abdul Hakkim ben Salazar 
thought about it for a time with 
furrowed brow. “No, Sidi,” he said 
at last, “for then there would be no 
one to chase us.” 

The female stopped, knelt in the 
path. 

“What is she doing now?” Dr. 
Stefanik asked. 

“She is taking off her shoes, in 
order to run faster than me.” 

“ *. And cattle after their kind, 
and every thing that creepeth upon 
the earth after his kind’! And yet 
you told Glinka I made them!” 
“Ah, but not out of what, Sidi,” 
Abdul said. 

The female, with a hopeful little 
bleat, arose and tucked her shoes 
under her arm, for youth is hope 
and kids will be kids, and off she 
went, clip-clop, clip-clop, down the 
rocky path to the sea.

I Plinglot- IV/»o You ? 

By FREDERIK POHL 

Illustrated by WOOD 



I 

L ET me see, I said, this is a 
time for urbane. Say little. 
Suggest much. So I smiled 
and nodded wisely without words, 
though the flash bulbs were fierce. 

The committee room was not 
big enough. They had had to move 
the hearings. Oh, it was hot. Senator 
Schnell came leaping down the 
aisle, sweating, his forehead glisten- 
ing, his gold tooth shining, and took 
my arm like a trap. 

“Capital, Mr. Smith,” he cried, 
nodding and grinning. “I am so glad 
you got here on time! One mo- 
ment” 

And he planted his feet and 
stopped me. And he turned me 
about to face the photographers, 
and he threw an arm around my 
shoulder as they flashed many 
bulbs. 

“Capital!” said the Senator with 
a happy voice. “Thanks, fellows! 
Come along, Mr. Smith!” 

They found me a first-class seat, 
near a window, with the air-condi- 
tioning making such a clatter that I 
could scarcely hear, but what was 
there to hear until I myself spoke?

ask only out of polite — you are two-eyes

I PLINGOT, WHO YOU? 



69 






Outside, the Washington Monu- 
ment cast aluminum rays from the 
sun. 

“We’ll get started in a minute,” 
whispered Mr. Hagsworth in my 
ear. He was young and working for 
the committee. “As soon as the net- 
works give us the go-ahead.” 

He patted my shoulder in a 
friendly way, with pride. They 
were always doing something with 
shoulders. He had brought me to 
the committee and thus I was, he 
thought, a sort of possession of his, 
a gift for Senator Schnell, though 
we know how wrong he was in that, 
of course. But he was proud. It was 
very hot and I had in me many 
headlines. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) Will you 
state your name, sir? 

A. Robert Smith. 

Q. Is that your real name? 

A. No. 

/"\H, that excited them all! They 
rustled and coughed and 
whispered, those in the many seats. 
Senator Schnell flashed his gold 
tooth. Senator Loveless, who was 
his enemy or his adjutant, as it 
were, a second commander of the, 
committee but of opposite party, 
he frowned under stiff silvery hair. 
But he knew I would say that. He 
had heard it all in executive session 
the night before. 

Mr. Hagsworth did not waste the 
moment. He went right ahead over 
the coughs and the rustles. 

70 



Q. Sir, have you adopted the iden- 
tity of “Robert Smith” in order 
to further your investigations 
on behalf of this committee? 

A. I have. 

Q. And can you — 

Q. (Senator Love/ess) Excuse me. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) Certainly, 
Senator. 

Q. ( Senator Loveless ) Thank you, 
Mr. Hagsworth. Sir— that is, Mr. 
Smith — do I understand that it 
would not be proper, or advis- 
able, for you to reveal — that is, 
to make public — your true or 
correct identity at this time? Or 
in these circumstances? 

A. Yes. 

Q. ( Senator Loveless ) Thank you 
very much, Mr. Smith. I just 
wanted to get that point cleared 
up. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth) Then tell us, 
Mr. Smith — 

Q. ( Senator Loveless ) It’s clear 
now. 

Q. (The Chairman) Thank you for 
helping us clarify the matter, 
Senator. Mr. Hagsworth, you 
may proceed. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth) Thank you, 
Senator Schnell. Thank you, 
Senator Loveless. Then, Mr. 
Smith, will you tell us the na- 
ture of the investigations you 
have just concluded for this 
committee? 

A. Certainly. I was investigating 
the question of interstellar 
space travel. 

GALAXY 




Q. That is, travel between the 
planets of different stars? 

A. That’s right. 

Q. And have you reached any con- 
clusions as to the possibility of 
such a thing? 

A. Oh, yes. Not just conclusions. I 
have definite evidence that one 
foreign power is in direct con- 
tact with creatures living on the 
planet of another star, and ex- 
pects to receive a visit from 
them shortly. 

Q. Will you tell us the name of that 
foreign power? 

A. Russia. 

Oh, it went very well. Pande- 
monium became widespread, much 
noise, much hammering by Sena- 
tor Schnell, and at the recess all 
the networks said it was a big Neil- 
sen. And Mr. Hagsworth was so 
pleased that he hardly asked me 
about the file again, which I en- 
joyed as it was a hard answer to 
give. 

“Good theater, ah, Mr. Smith,” 
he winked. 

I only smiled. 

T^HE afternoon also was splen- 
didly hot, especially as Senator 
Schnell kept coming beside me and 
the bulbs flashed. It was excellent, 
excellent 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth) Mr. Smith, 
this morning you told us that 
a foreign power was in contact 
with a race of beings living on 
a planet of the star Aldebaran. 



Is that right? It is correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Can you describe that race for 
us? I mean the ones you have 
referred to as “Aldebaranians”? 
A. Certainly, although their own 
name for themselves is — is a 
word in their language which 
you might here render as “Tri- 
ops.” They average about 
eleven inches tall. They have 
two legs, like yourself. They 
have three eyes and they live in 
crystal cities under the water, 
although they are air-breathers. 
Q. Why is that, Mr. Smith? 

A. The surface of their planet is 
ravaged by enormous beasts 
against which they are defense- 
less. 

Q. But they have powerful weap- 
ons? 

A. Oh, very powerful, Mr. Hags- 
worth. 

And then it was time for me to 
take it out and show it to them, the 
Aldebaranian hand-weapon. It was 
small and soft and I had to fire it 
with a bent pin, but it made a hole 
through three floors and the cement 
of the basement, and they were 
very interested. Oh, yes! 

So I talked all that afternoon 
about the Aldebaranians, though 
what did they matter? Mr. Hags- 
worth did not ask me about other 
races, on which I could have said 
something of greater interest. Af- 
terward we came to my suite at the 
Mayflower Hotel and Mr. Hqgs-

worth said with admiration: “You 
handled yourself beautifully, Mr. 
Smith. When this is over, I wonder 
if you would consider some sort of 
post here in Washington.” 

“When this is over?” 

“Oh,” he said, “I’ve been around 
for some years, Mr. Smith. I’ve 
seen them come and I’ve seen them 
go. Every newspaper in the coun- 
try is full of Aldebaranians tonight, 
but next year? They’ll be shouting 
about something new.” 

“They will not,” I said surely. 

TJTE shrugged. “As you say,” he 
said agreeably. “At any rate, 
it’s a great sensation now. Senator 
Schnell is tasting the headlines. 
He’s up for re-election next year, 
you know, and just between the 
two of us, he was afraid he might be 
defeated.” 

“Impossible, Mr. Hagsworth,” I 
said out of certain knowledge, but 
could not convey this to him. He 
thought I only was being polite. It 
did not matter. 

“He’ll be gratified to hear that,” 
said Mr. Hagsworth and he stood 
up and winked, he was a great hu- 
man for winking. “But think about 
what I said about a job, Mr. Smith 
... Or would you care to tell me 
your real name?” 

Why not? Sporting! “Plinglot,” 
I said. 

He said with a puzzled face, 
“Plinglot? Plinglot? That’s an odd 
name.” 



I didn’t say anything. Why 
should I? 

“But you’re an odd man,” he 
sighed. “I don’t mind telling you 
that there are a lot of questions I’d 
like to ask. For instance, the file 
folder of correspondence between 
you and Senator Heffeman. I don’t 
suppose you’d care to tell me how 
come no employee of the commit- 
tee remembers anything about it, 
although the folder turned up in our 
files just as you said it would?” 

Senator Heffeman was dead; 
that was why the correspondence 
had been with him. But I know 
tricks for awkward questions — you 
give only another question instead 
of answer. 

“Don’t you trust me, Mr. Hags- 
worth?” 

He looked at me queerly and 
left without speaking. No matter. 
It was time. I had very much to 
do. 

“No calls,” I told the switch- 
board person, “and no visitors. I 
must rest.” Also there would be a 
guard, Hagsworth had promised. I 
wondered how he would have ar- 
ranged the same if I had not re- 
quested it, but that also did not 
matter. 

I sat quickly in what looked, for 
usual purposes, like a large arm- 
chair, purple embroidery on the 
headrest. It was my spaceship, with 
cosmetic upholstery. Z-z-z-z-zit, 
quick like that, that’s all there was 
to it and I was there.

O LD days I could not have 
timed it so well, for the old 
one slept all the day and worked, 
drinking, all the night. But now 
they kept capitalist hours. 

“Good morning, gospodin,” cried 
the man in the black tunic, leaping 
up alertly as I opened the tall 
double doors. “I trust you slept 
well.” 

I had changed quickly into pa- 
jamas and a bathrobe. Stretching, 
yawning, I grumbled in flawless 
Russian in a sleepy way: “All right, 
all right. What time is it?” 

“Eight in the morning, Gospodin 
Arakelian. I shall order your break- 
fast.” 

“Have we time?” 

“There is time, gospodin, espe- 
cially as you have already shaved.” 
I looked at him with more care, 
but he had a broad open Russian 
face. There was no trickery on it or 
suspicion. I drank some tea and 
changed into street clothing again, 
a smaller size as I was now smaller. 
The Hotel Metropole doorman 
was holding open the door of the 
black Zis, and we bumped, bumped 
over cobblestones to the white 
marble building with no name. 
Here in Moscow it was also hot, 
though only early morning. 

This morning their expressions 
were all different in the dim, cool 
room. Worried. There were three 
of them: 



Blue eyes; Kvetchnikov. The 
tall one, with eyes so very blue, he 
looked at the wall and the ceiling 
but not at me, and though some- 
times he smiled, there was nothing 
behind it. 

Red beard; Muzhnets. He tapped 
with a pencil softly, on thin sheets 
of paper. 

And the old one. He sat like a 
squat fat Buddha. His name was 
Tadjensevitch. 

Yesterday they were reserved, 
suspicious, but they could not help 
themselves; they would do what- 
ever I asked. There was no choice 
for them; they reported to the chief 
himself, and how could they let 
such a thing as I had told them go 
untaken? No, they must swallow 
bait. But today there was worry on 
their faces. 

The worry was not about me; 
they knew me. Or so they thought. 
“Hello, hello, Arakelian,” said Blue 
Eyes to me, though his gaze ex- 
amined the rug in front of my 
chair. “Have you more to tell us 
today?” 

I asked without alarm: “What 
more could I have?” 

“Oh,” said Blue-Eye Kvetchni- 
kov, looking at the old man, “per- 
haps you can explain what hap- 
pened in Washington last night.” 

“In Washington?” 

“In Washington, yes. A man ap- 
peared before one of the commit- 
tees of their Senate. He spoke of 
the Aldebaratniki, and he spoke 



I PL1NG0T, WHO YOU?

also of the Soviet Union. Arakelian, 
tell us how this is possible.” 

The old man whispered softly: 
“Show him the dispatch.” 

¥> ED Beard jumped. He stopped 
tapping on the thin paper and 
handed it to me. “Read!” he or- 
dered in a voice of danger, though 
I was not afraid. 

I read. It was a diplomatic tele- 
gram, from their embassy in Wash- 
ington, and what it said was what 
every newspaper said, it was no 
diplomatic secret, it was headlines. 
One Robert Smith, a fictitious 
name, real identity unknown, had 
appeared before the Schnell Com- 
mittee. He had told them of Soviet 
penetration of the stars. Consider- 
ing limitations, excellent, it was an 
admirably accurate account. 

I creased the paper and handed 
back to Muzhnets. “I have read it.” 
Old One: “You have nothing to 
say?” 

“Only this.” I leaped up on two 
legs and pointed at him. "I did not 
think you would bungle this! How 
dared you allow this information 
to become public?” 

“How—” 

“How did that weapon get out 
of your country?” 

“Weap— ” 

“Is this Soviet efficiency?” I 
cried loudly. “Is it proletarian dis- 
cipline?” 

Red-Beard Muzhnets intervened. 
“Softly, Comrade,” he cried. 



“Please! We must not lose tem- 
pers!” 

I made a sound of disgust. I did 
it very well. “I warned you,” I said, 
low, and made my face sad and 
stern. “I told you that there was a 
danger that the bourgeois-capital- 
ists would interfere. Why did you 
not listen? Why did you permit 
their spies to steal the weapon I 
gave you?” 

Tadjensevitch whispered agedly : 
“That weapon is still here.” 

“But this report—” 

“There must be another weapon, 
Arakelian. And do you see? That 
means the Americans are also in 
contact with the Aldebaratniki.” 

It was time for chagrin. I ad- 
mitted: “You are right.” 

He sighed. “Comrades, the Mar- 
shal will be here in a moment. Let 
us settle this.” I composed my face 
. and looked at him. “Arakelian, an- 
swer this question straight out. Do 
you know how this American could 
have got in touch with the Alde- 
baratniki now?” 

“How could I, gospodin?" 
“That,” he said thoughtfully, “is 
not a straight answer but it is an- 
swer enough. How could you? You 
have not left the Metropole. And 
in any case the Marshal is now 
coming. I hear his guard.” 

W E all stood up, very formal, it 
was a question of socialist dis- 
cipline. 

In came this man, the Marshal, 
GALAXY 



74 




who ruled two hundred million hu- 
mans, smoking a cigarette in a pa- 
per holder, with small pig’s eyes 
looking here and there and at me. 
Five very large men were with him, 
but they never said anything at all. 
He sat down grunting. It was not 
necessary for him to speak loud or 
to speak clear, it was necessary that 
those around him should hear any- 
how. It was not deafness that 
caused Tadjensevitch to wear a 
hearing aid. 

The old man jumped up. “Com- 
rade Party Secretary,” he said, 
not now whispering, no, “this man 
is P.P. Arakelian.” 

Grunt from the Marshal. 

“Yes, Comrade Party Secretary, 
he has come to us with the sugges- 
tion that we sign a treaty with a 
race of creatures inhabiting a 
planet of the star Aldebaran. Our 
astronomers say they cannot dis- 
pute any part of his story. And the 
M.V.D. has assuredly verified his 
reliability in certain documents 
signed by the late—” cough— “Com- 
rade Beria.” That too had not been 
easy and would have been less so 
if Beria had not been dead. 

Grunt from the Marshal. Old 
Tadjensevitch looked expectant at 
me. 

“I beg your pardon?” I said. 

Old Tadjensevitch said without 
patience : “The Marshal asked 

about terms ” 

“Oh,” I bowed, “there are no 
terms. These are unworldly crea- 

I PLINGOT, WHO YOU? 



tures, excellent comrade.” I thought 
to mention it was a joke, but none 
laughed. “Unworldly,” you see, 
“They wish only to be friends. 
With you, with the Americans, 
they do not know the difference, 
it is all in whom they first see.” 

Grunt “Will they sign a treaty?” 
Tadjensevitch translated. 

“Of course.” 

Grunt. Translation: “Have they 
enemies? There is talk in the 
American document of creatures 
that destroy them. We must know 
what enemies our new friends may 
have.” 

“Only animals, excellent com- 
rade. Like your wolves of Siberia, 
but huge as the great blue whale.” 

Grunt. Tadjensevitch said: “The 
Marshal asks if you can guarantee 
that the creatures will come first 
to us.” 

“No. I can only suggest. I cannot 
guarantee there will be no error.” 

“But if—” 

“If!” I cried loudly. “If there is 
error, you have Red Army to cor- 
rect it!” 

T HEY looked at me strange. 

They did not expect that. But 
they did not understand. 

I gave them no time. I said 
quickly: “Now, Excellency, one 
thing more. I have a present for 
you” 

Grunt. 

I hastily said : “I saved it, Com- 
rade. Excuse me. In my pocket” 



75 




I reached, most gently; those 
five men all looked at me now 
with much care. For the first 
demonstration, I had produced an 
Aldebaranian hand-weapon, three 
inches long, capable of destroying 
a bull at five hundred yards, but 
now for this Russian I had more. 

“See,” I said, and took it out to 
hand him, a small glittering thing, 
carved of a single solid diamond, 
an esthetic statue four inches long. 

Oh, I did not like to think of it 
wasted! But it was important that 
this man should be off guard, and 
so I handed it to one of the tall 
silent men, who thumbed it over 
and then passed it on, scowling, to 
the Marshal. I was sorry, yes. It 
was a favorite thing, a clever carv- 
ing that they had made in the 
water under Aldebaran’s rays; it 
was almost greater than I could 
have made myself. No, I will not 
begrudge it them, it was greater, I 
could not have done so well! 

Unfortunate that so great a race 
should have needed attention; un- 
fortunate that I must now give this 
memento away; but I needed to 
make an effect and, yes, I did! 

Oh, diamond is great to humans; 
the Marshal looked surprised, and 
grunted, and one of the silent tall 
five reached in his pocket, and took 
out something that glittered on 
silken ribbon. He looped it around 
my neck. 

“Hero of Soviet Labor,” he said, 
“First Class. With emeralds.” 

76 



“Thank you, Marshal,” I said. 
Grunt “The Marshal,” said Tad- 
jensevitch in a thin, thin voice, 
“thanks you. Certain investigations 
must be made. He will see you 
again tomorrow morning.” 

This was wrong, but I did not 
wish to make him right; I said 
again: “Thank you.” 

A grunt from the Marshal; he 
stopped and looked at me, and 
then he spoke loud so that, though 
he grunted, I understood. “Tell,” 
he said, “the Aldebaratniki, tell 
them they must come to us. If 
their ship should land in the wrong 
country . 

He stopped at the door and 
looked at me powerfully. 

“I hope,” he said, “that it will 
not,” and he left, and they escorted 
me back in the Zis sedan to the 
room at the Hotel Metropole. 

Ill 

S O that was that and z-z-z-z-zit, 
I was gone again, leaving an 
empty and heavily guarded room 
in the old hotel. 

In Paris it was midday, I had 
spent a long time in Moscow. In 
Paris it was also hot, and as the 
gray-haired small man with the 
rosette of the Legion in his button- 
hole escorted me along the 
Champs Elysees, slim-legged girls 
in bright short skirts smiled at us. 
No matter. I did not care one pin 
for all those bright slim girls. 



GALA ICY 




But it was necessary to look, 
the man expected it of me, and 
he was the man I had chosen. In 
America I worked through a com- 
mittee of their Senate, in Russia 
the Comrade Party Secretary, 
here my man was a M. Duplessin, 
a small straw but the one to wreck 
a dromedary. 

He was a member of the Cham- 
ber of Deputies, elected as a Chris- 
tian Socialist Radical Democrat, 
a party which stood between the 
Non-Clerical Catholic Workers’ 
Movement on one side and the 
F.C.M., or Movement for Chris- 
tian Brotherhood, on the other. His 
party had three deputies in the 
Chamber, and the other two hated 
each other. Thus M. Duplessin 
held the balance of power in his 
party, which held the balance of 
power in the Right Centrist Coali- 
tion, which held the balance 
through the entire Anti-Commu- 
nist Democratic Front which sup- 
ported the premier. Yes. M. Du- 
plessin was the man I needed. 

I had slipped a folder into the 
locked files of a Senate committee 
and forged credentials into the 
records of Russia’s M.V.D., but 
both together were easier than the 
finding of this right man. But I 
had him now, and he was taking 
me to see certain persons who also 
knew his importance, persons who 
would do as he told them. 

“Monsieur,” he said gravely, “it 
lacks a small half-hour of the ap- 



pointed time. Might one not enjoy 
an aperitif?” 

“One might,” I said fluently, and 
permitted him to find us a table 
under the trees, for I knew that he 
was unsure of me, it was neces- 
sary to cause him to become sure. 

“Ah,” said Duplessin, sighing, 
and placed hat, cane and gloves on 
a filigree metal chair. 

He ordered drinks and when 
they came sipped slightly, look- 
ing away. 

“My friend,” he said at last, '“tell 
me of les aldebaragnard s. We 
French have traditions — liberty, 
equality, fraternity — we made 
Arabs into citizens of the Republic 
— always has France been man- 
kind’s spiritual home. But, mon- 
sieur. Nevertheless. Three eyes?” 

“They are really very nice,” I 
told him with great sincerity, 
though it was probably no longer 
true. 

“Hum.” 

“And,” I said, “they know of 
love.” 

¥TE said mistily, sighing again, 
“Love. Tell me, monsieur. 
Tell me of love on Aldebaran.” 

“They live on a planet,” I mis- 
stated somewhat, “Aldebaran is 
the star itself. But I will tell you 
what you ask, M. Duplessin. It is 
thus: When a young Triop, for so 
they call themselves, comes of age, 
he swims far out into the wide 
sea. Far from his crystal city, out 



I PLINGOT, WHO YOU? 



77 




into the pellucid water, where giant 
fan-tailed fish of rainbow colors 
swim endlessly above, tinting the 
pale sunlight that filters through 
the water and their ' scales. Tiny 
bright fish give off starlike flashes 
from patterned luminescent spots 
on their scales.” 

“It sounds most beautiful, mon- 
sieur,” Duplessin said with polite. 

“It is most beautiful. And the 
young Triop swims until he sees— 
Her” 

“Ah, monsieur.” He was more 
than polite, I considered, he was 
interested. 

“They speak not a word,” I 
added, “for the water is all around 
and they wear masks, otherwise 
they could not breathe. They can- 
not speak, no, and one cannot see 
the other’s eyes. They approach in 
silence and in mystery.” 

He sighed and sipped his cassis. 
“Then,” I said, “they know, 
though there is no way that they 
can know. But they do. They swim 
about each other searchingly, ten- 
derly, sadly. Yes, sadly— is beauty 
not always in some way sad? A 
moment And then they are one.” 
“They do not speak?” 

I shook my head. 

“Ever?” 

“Never until all is over and they 
meet elsewhere again.” 

“Ah, monsieur!” He stared into 
his small glass of tincture. “Mon- 
sieur,” he said, “may one hope— 
that is, is it possible— oh, monsieur! 



Might one go there, soon?” 

I said with all my cunning: “All 
the things are possible, M. Duples- 
sin, if the Triops can be saved 
from destruction. Consider for 
yourself, if you please, that to turn 
such a people over to the brutes 
with the Red Stai— or these with 
the forty-nine white stars, what dif- 
ference?— is to destroy them.” 
“Never, my friend, never!” he 
cried strongly. “Let them come! 
Let them entrust themselves to 
France! France will protect them, 
my friend, or France will die!” 

¥ T was all very simple after that, 
I was free within an hour after 
lunch and, certainly, z-z-z-z-zit. 

My spaceship deposited me in 
this desert, Mojave, I think. Or al- 
most Mojave, in its essential 
Americanness. Yes. It was in 
America, for what other place 
would do? I had accomplished 
much, but there was yet a cosmetic 
touch or two before I could say I 
had accomplished all. 

I scanned the scene, everything 
was well, there was no one. Dis- 
tantly planes howled, but of no 
importance : stratosphere j ets, what 
would they know of one man on 
the sand four miles below? I 
worked. 

Five round trips, carrying what 
was needed, between this desert 
place and my bigger ship. And 
where was that? Ah. Safe. It hurled 
swinging around Mars, yes, quite 



78 



GALAXY 




safe. Astronomers might one day 
map it, but on that day it would 
not matter, no. Oh, it would not 
matter at all. 

Since there was time, on my 
first trip I reassumed my shape 
and ate, it was greatly restful. 
Nine useful arms and ample feet, 
it became easy; quickly I carried 
one ton of materials, two thousand 
pounds, from my armchair ferry 
to the small shelter in which I con- 
structed my cosmetic appliance. 
Shelter? Why a shelter, you ask? 
Oh, I say, for artistic reasons, and 
in the remote chance that some 
low-flying plane might blunder- 
somely pass, though it would not. 
But it might. 

Lefs see, I said, let me think, 
uranium and steel, strontium and 
cobalt, a touch of sodium for yel- 
low, have I everything? Yes. I have 
everything, I said, and I assem- 
bled the cosmetic bomb and set 
the fuse. Good-by, bomb, I said 
with affection and, z-z-z~z-zit, arm- 
chair and Plinglot were back 
aboard my ship circling Mars. 
Nearly done, nearly done! 

There quickly I assembled the 
necessary data for the Aldebaran- 
ian rocket, my penultimate— or 
Next to Closing— task. 

Now. This penultimate task, it 
was not a difficult one, no, but it 
demanded some concentration. I 
had a ship. No fake, no crude imi- 
tation! It was an authentic rocket 
ship of the Aldebaranians, designed 

I PLINGOT, WHO YOU? 



to travel to their six moons, with 
vent baffles for underwater take- 
off due to certain exigencies (e^., 
inimical animals ashore) of their 
culture. Yes. It was real. I had 
brought it on purpose all the way. 

Now, I say once more, now; I 
did what I had necessarily to do, 
which was to make a course for 
this small ship. There was no crew. 
(Not anywhere.) The course was 
easy to compute, I did it rather 
well, but there was setting of in- 
struments, automation of controls 
— oh, it took time, took time — but 
I did it 

It was my way, I am workman- 
like and reliable, ask Mother. 
The human race would not know 
an authentic Aldebaranian rocket 
from a lenticular Cetan shrimp, 
but they might, hey? The Alde- 
baranians had kindly developed 
rockets and it was no great trouble 
to bring, as well as more authentic. 
I brought. And having completed 
all this, and somewhat pleased, 
I stood to look around. 

But I was not alone. 

r | 1 HIS was not a fortunate thing, 
it meant trouble. 

I at once realized what my com- 
panion, however unseen, must be, 
since it could not be human. 

I stood absolutely motionless 
and looked, looked. As you have in 
almost certain probability never 
observed the interior of an Alde- 
baranian rocket, I shall describe: 



79 




Green metal in cruciform shapes 
(“chairs”), sparkling mosaics of 
colored light (“maps”), ferrous al- 
loys in tortured cuprous-glassy 
conjunction (“instruments”). All 
motionless. But something moved. 

I saw! An Aldebaranian! One 
of the Triops, a foot-high manni- 
kin, looking up at me out of three 
terrified blue eyes. Yes, I had 
brought the ship, but I had not 
brought it empty. One of the crea- 
tures had stowed away aboard. 
And there it was. 

I lunged toward it savagely. It 
looked up at me and squeaked like 
a bell: “Why? Why, Plinglot, why 
did you kill my people?” 

It is so annoying to be held to 
account for every little thing. But 
I said in moderate cunning: “Stand 
quiet, small creature, and let me 
get hold of you. Why are you not 
dead?” 

It squeaked pathetically— not in 
English, to be sure! but I make al- 
lowances — it squeaked: “Plinglot, 
you came to our planet as a friend 
from outer space, one who wished 
to help our people join forces to 
destroy the great killing land 
beasts.” 

“That seemed appropriate,” I 
conceded. 

“We believed you, Plinglot! All 
our nations believed you. But you 
caused dissension. You pitted us 
one against the other, so that one 
nation no longer trusted another. 
We had abandoned war, Plinglot, 



for more than a hundred years, for 
we dared not wage war.” 

“That is true,” I agreed. 

“But you tricked us! War came, 
Plinglot! And at your hands. As 
this ship was plucked from its 
berth with only myself aboard, I 
received radio messages that a 
great war was breaking out and 
that fhe seas were to be boiled. It 
is the ultimate weapon, Plinglot! 
By now my planet is dry and 
dead. Why did you do it?” 
“Small Triop,” I lectured, “listen 
to this. You are male, one sup- 
poses, and you must know that no 
female Aldebaranian survives. 
Very well. You are the last of your 
race. There is no future. You 
might as well be dead.” 

“I know,” he wept. 

“And therefore you should kill 
yourself. Check,” I invited, “my 
logic with the aid of your comput- 
ing machine, if you wish. But 
please do not disturb the course 
computations I have set up on it.” 
“It is not necessary to check 
your logic, Plinglot,” he said with 
sad. “You are right.” 

“So kill yourself!” I bellowed. 
The small creature, how foolish, 
would not do this. No, he said: “I 
do not want to, Plinglot,” apolo- 
getically. “But I will not disturb 
your course.” 

VV/ ELL, it was damned decent 
** of him, in a figure of speech, 
I believed, for that course was 



80 



GALAXY 




most important to me. On it de- 
pended the suceess of my present 
mission, for it was to demolish 
Earth as I had his own planet I 
attempted to explain, in way of 
thanks, but he would not under- 
stand, no. 

“Earth?” he squeaked feebly. 

I attempted to make him see, 
yes, Earth, that planet so far away, 
it too had a population which was 
growing large and fierce and smart, 
it too was hovering on the fringe 
of space travel. Oh, it was danger- 
ous, but he would not see, though 
I explained and I am Plinglot I 
can allow no rivals in space, it is 
my assigned task, given in hand by 
the great Mother. Well. I terrified 
him, it was all I could do. 

Having locked him in a helpless 
compartment of his own ship, I 
consulted my time. 

It was fleeing. I flopped onto 
my armchair; z-z-z-z-zit; once again 
in the room in the Hotel May- 
flower, Washington, U.SA. 

Things progressed, all was 
ready. I opened the door, affecting 
having just awaked. A chamber- 
maid turned from dusting pictures 
on the wall, said, “Good morning, 
sir,” looked at me and — oh! 
screamed. Screamed in a terrible 
tone. 

Careless Plinglot! I had forgot 
to return to human form. 

Most fortunately, she fainted. I 
quickly turned human and found 
a rope. It took very much time, 



and time was passing, while the 
rocket hastened to cover forty mil- 
lion miles; it would arrive soon 
where I had sent it. I hurried. 
Hardly, hardly, I made myself do 
it, though as anyone on Tau Ceti 
knows, it was difficult for me. I 
tied her. I forced a pillowcase, or 
one corner of it, into her mouth so 
that she might not cry out; and 
even locked her in a closet Oh, it 
was hard. 

Questions? Difficulty? Danger? 
Yes. They were all there to be 
considered, too, but I had no time 
to consider them. Time was pass- 
ing, I have said, and time passed 
for me. 

It was only a temporary expedi- 
ent. In time she would be found. 
Of course. This did not matter. In 
time there would be no time, you 
see, for time would come to an 
end for chambermaid, Duplessin, 
Senators and the M.VX>., and then 
what? 

Then Plinglot would have com- 
pleted this, his mission, and two- 
eyes would join three-eyes, good- 
by. 

IV 

S ENATOR Schnell this time 
was waiting for me at the 
curb, in a hollow square of news- 
men. 

“Mr. Smith,” he cried, “how 
good to see you. Now, please, fel- 
lows! Mr. Smith is a busy man. 



82 



GALAXY 




Oh, all right, just one picture” 
And he made to shoo the pho- 
tographers off while wrapping him- 
self securely to my side. 

“Terrible men,” he whispered 
out of the golden comer of his 
mouth, smiling, smiling, “how they 
pester me!” 

“I am sorry, Senator,” I said po- 
litely and permitted him to lead 
me through the flash barrage to the 
large room for the hearings. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) Mr. Smith, 
in yesterday’s testimony you 
gave us to understand that Rus- 
sia was making overtures to the 
alien creatures from Aldebaran. 
Now I’d like to call your atten- 
tion to something. Have you 
seen this morning’s papers? 

A. No. 

Q. Then let me read you an ex- 
tract from Pierce Truman’s col- 
umn which has just come to my 
attention. It starts, “After yes- 
terday’s sensational rev—” 

Q. (Senator Loveless ) Excuse me. 
Mr. Hagsworth. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) elations.” 

Q. (Senator Loveless ) I only want 
to know, or to ask, if that docu- 
ment — that is, the newspaper 
which you hold in your hand— 
is a matter of evidence. By this 
I mean an exhibit. If so, I raise 
the question, or rather sugges- 
tion, that it should be properly 
marked and entered. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) Well, Sena- 
tor, I— 



Q. (Senator Loveless ) As an ex- 
hibit, I mean. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) Yes, as an ex- 
hibit I— 

Q. (Senator Loveless ) Excuse me 
for interrupting. It seemed an 
important matter — important 
procedural matter, that is. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) Certainly, 
Senator. Well, Senator, I in- 
tended to read it only in order 
to have Mr. Smith give us his 
views. 

Q. (Senator Loveless ) Thank you 
for that explanation, Mr. Hags- 
worth. Still it seems to me, or 
at the moment it appears to me, 
that it ought to be marked and 
entered. 

Q. (The Chairman) Senator, in 
my view— 

Q. (Senator Loveless) As an ex- 
hibit, that is. 

Q. (The Chairman) Thank you 
for that clarification, Senator. 
In my view, however, since as 
Mr. Hagsworth has said it is 
only Mr. Smith’s views that he 
is seeking to get out, then the 
article itself is not evidence but 
merely an adjunct to question- 
ing. Anyway, frankly, Senator, 
that’s the way I see it But I 
don’t want to impose my will 
on the Committee. I hope you 
understand that, all of you. 

Q. (Mr. Hagsworth) Certainly, sir. 

Q. (Senator Loveless) Oh, none 
of us has any idea, or suspicion, 
Senator Schnell, that you have 



I PLINGOT, WHO YOU? 



83 




any such design, or purpose. 

Q. (Senator Duffy) Of course not 
Q. (Senator Fly) No, not here . 

i"iH, time, time! I looked at the 
clock on the wall and time 
was going, I did not wish to be 
here when it started. Of course. 
Ten o’clock. Ten-thirty. Five min- 
utes approaching eleven. Then this 
Mr. Pierce Truman’s column at 
last was marked and entered and 
recorded after civil objection and 
polite concession from Senator 
Schnell and in thus wise made an 
immutable, permanent, indestruct- 
ible part of the files of this mut- 
able, transient, soon to be de- 
strpyed committee. Oh, comedy! 
But it would not be for laughing 
if I dawdled here too late. 

Somehow, somehow, Mr. Hags- 
worth was entitled at last to read 
his column and it said as follows. 

After yesterday’s sensational rev- 
elations before the Schnell Com- 
mittee, backstage Washington was 
offering bet9 that nothing could top 
the mysterious Mr. Smith’s weird 
story of creatures from outer space. 
But the toppers may already be on 
hand. Here are two questions for 
you, Senator Schnell: 

What were three Soviet U.N. 
military attaches doing at a special 
showing at the Hayden Planetarium 
last night? 

And what’s the truth beyond the 
reports that are filtering into C.I.A. 
from sources in Bulgaria, concern- 
ing a special parade scheduled for 
Moscow’s Red Square tomorrow to 



welcome “unusual and very special” 
V.I.P.8, names unknown? 

Exhausted from this effort, the 
committee declared a twenty-min- 
ute recess. I glowered at the clock, 
time, time! 

Mr. Hagsworth had plenty of 
time, he thought, he was not wor- 
ried. 

He cornered me in the cloak- 
room. 

“Smoke?” he said graciously, of- 
fering a package of cigarettes. I 
said thank you, I do not smoke. 
“Care for a drink?” I do not drink, 
I told him. “Or — ?” He nodded 
toward the tiled room with the 
chromium pipes; I do not do that 
either, but I could not tell him 
so, only I shook my head. 

“Well, Mr. Smith,” he said again, 
“you make a good witness. I’m 
sorry,” he added, “to spring that 
column on you like that. But I 
couldn’t help it.” 

“No matter,” I said. 

“You’re a good sport, Smith. 
You see, one of the reporters 
handed it to me as we walked into 
the hearing room.” 

“All right,” I said, wishing to be 
thought generous. 

“Well, I had to get it into the 
record. What’s it about, eh?” 

I said painfully (time, time!), 
“Mr. Hagsworth, I have testified 
the Russians also wish the ship from 
Aldebaran. And it is coming close. 
Soon it will land.”

GALAXY 




“Good,” he said, smiling and rub- 
bing his hands, “very good! And 
you will bring them to us?” 

“I will do,” I said, “the best I can,” 
ambiguously, but that was enough 
to satisfy him, and recess was over. 
Q. (Mr. Hagsworth ) Mr. Smith, 
do I understand that you have 
some knowledge of the pro- 
posed movements of the voy- 
agers from Aldebaran? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Can you tell us what you know? 
A. I can. Certainly. Even now an 
Aldebaranian rocket ship is ap- 
proaching the Earth. Through 
certain media of communica- 
tion which I cannot discuss in 
open hearing, as you under- 
stand, certain proposals have 
been made to them on behalf of 
this country. 

Q. And their reaction to these pro- 
posals, Mr. Smith? 

A. They have agreed to land in the 
United' States for discussions. 

TTAPPY commotion, the idiots. 

The flash bulbs went like mad. 
Only the clock was going, going, 
and I commenced to worry, where 
was the ship? Was forty lousy mil- 
lion miles so much? But no, it was 
not so much; and when the messen- 
ger came racing in the door, I knew 
it was time. 

One messenger, first. He ran 
wildly down among the seats, 
searching, then stopping at the seat 
on the aisle where Pierce Truman 



sat regarding me with an ophidian 
eye, stopped and whispered. Then a 
couple more, strangers, hatless and 
hair flying, also messengers, came 
hurrying in — and more — to the 
committee, to the newsmen — the 
word had got out. 

“Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman!” 
It was Senator Loveless, he was 
shouting, some person had whis- 
pered in his ear and he could not 
wait to tell his news. But everyone 
had that news, you see, it was no 
news to the chairman, he already 
had a slip of paper in his hand. 

He stood up and stared blindly 
into the television cameras, without 
smile now, the gold tooth not flash- 
ing. 

He said : “Gentlemen, I—” 

And he stopped, for a moment, to 
catch his breath and to shake his 
head. 

“Gentlemen,” he said, “gentle- 
men, I have here a report,” staring 
incredulous at the scrawled slip of 
paper. 

In the room was quickly silence, 
even Senator Loveless, and Pierce 
Truman stopped at the door on his 
way out to listen. 

“This report,” he said, “comes 
from the Arlington Naval Observa- 
tory — in, gentlemen, my own home 
state, the Old Dominion, Virginia—” 
He paused and shook himself, yes, 
and made himself look again at the 
paper. “From the Arlington Naval 
Observatory, where the radio-tele- 
scope experts inform us that an ob- 



! PLINGOT, WHO YOU? 



85 




ject of unidentified origin and re- 
markable speed has entered the 
atmosphere of the Earth from outer 
space!” 

Cries. Sighs. Shouts. But he 
stopped them, yes, with a hand. 
“But, gentlemen, that is not all! Ar- 
lington has tracked this object and 
it has landed. Not in our country, 
gentlemen! Not even in Russia! 
But—” he shook the paper rattlingly 
before him— “in North Africa, gen- 
tlemen! In the desert of Algeria!” 
Oh, much commotion then, but 
not joyous. 

“Doublecross!” shouted someone, 
and I made an expression of aston- 
ish. Adjourned, banged the gavel of 
the chairman, and only just in time; 
the clock said nearly twelve and my 
cosmetic bomb was set for one- 
fifteen. Oh, I had timed it close. But 
now was danger and I had to leave, 
which I did hardly. 

But I could not evade Mr. Hags- 
worth, who rode with me in taxi to 
hotel, chattering, chattering. I did 
not listen. 

V 

TVT OW this is how it was, an alle- 
" gory or parable. Make a chem- 
ical preparation, you see? Take 
hydrogen and take oxygen — very 
pure in both cases — blend them 
and strike a spark. Nothing hap- 
pens. They do not burn! It is true, 
though you may not believe me. 
But with something added, yes, 



they burn. For instance, let the 
spark be a common match, with so 
tiny you can hardly detect it a quar- 
ter-droplet of water bonded into its 
substance. Yes, with the water they 
will burn — more than burn — ker- 
blam, the hydrogen and oxygen 
fiercely unite. Water, it is the cata- 
lyst which makes it go. 

Similarly, I reflected (unhearing 
the chatter of Mr. Hags worth), it is 
a catalyst which is needed on Earth, 
and this catalyst I have made, my 
cosmetic appliance, my bomb. 

The chemicals were stewing to- 
gether nicely. There was a ferment 
of suspicion in Russia, of fear in 
America, of jealousy in the African 
colony of France where I had made 
the ship land. Oh, they were jumpy 
now! I could feel forces building 
around me, even the driver of the 
cab, half watching the crowded 
streets, half listening to the hyster- 
ical cries of his little radio. To the 
Mayflower, hurrying. All the while, 
the city was getting excited around 
us. 

That was the ferment, and by my 
watch the catalyst was quite near. 

“Wait,” said Mr. Hagsworth, 
pleading, in the lobby, “come have 
a drink, Smith.” 

“I don’t drink.” 

“I forgot,” he apologized. “Well, 
would you care to sit for a moment 
in the bar with me? I’d like to talk 
to you. This is all happening too 
fast.” 

“Come along to my room,” I said,

not wanting him, no, but what harm 
could he do? And I did not want to 
be away from my purple armchair, 
not at all. 

So up we go and there is still 
time, I am glad. Enough time. The 
elevator could have stuck, my door 
could have somehow been locked 
against me, by error I could have 
gone to the wrong floor — no, every- 
thing was right. We were there and 
there was time. 

I excused myself a moment 
(though it could have been for- 
ever) and walked into the inner 
room of this suite. Yes, it was there, 
ready. It squatted purple, and no 
human would think, to look at it, 
that it was anything but an arm- 
chair but it was much more and if 
I went and sat in it, z-z-zz-zit, and 
I would be gone. 

A man spoke. 

i^H, how I turned with startle, 
” looking. I did not wish a man 
to be there. 

But there a man was, looking at 
me also, out of the door to the tiled 
room, red-faced, in blue coveralls, 
and he spoke. 

Well. For a moment, I felt alarm. 
(I remember, e.g., the human wom- 
an whom I had left bound in closet, 
and pondered that she might have 
been discovered. But it was not this, 
no, for on this man’s face was only 
smile.) And he said with apology: 
“Oh, hello, sir. Sorry. But we had a 
complaint from the floor below, 

I PLINGOT, WHO YOU? 



leak in the plumbing, dripping 
through their ceiling, I’ve got it 
nearly fixed now, sir ” 

Oh, all right I shrugged for him 
and — and — Oh, and went back to 
Mr. Hagsworth. 

It was mistake, the mistake of a 
true artist, of course. In my mind 
had been something other than 
going back to Mr. Hagsworth. I 
could, exemplarily, have made a 
further checking expedition. That 
is, z-z-z-z-zit, to the George V Ho- 
tel in Paris, and to telephone there 
M. Duplessin, to insure that he 
would not allow Russians or Amer- 
icans near the ship which had land- 
ed in that part of Metropolitan 
France which lies in Africa, Algeria 
. no, not if the Russian ambassa- 
dors and the Americans made of his 
life a living hell. 

And then I could also, z-z-z-z-zit, 
to Metropole in Moscow. There to 
phone Tadjensevitch (not the Mar- 
shal, he would not speak on tele- 
phone to me) to urge him also on. 
To say to him: These Americans 
are about to steal your Aldebara- 
nians, and besides I just have 
learned about oil deposits, enor- 
mous, under the Aldebaranian seas. 

Or I could have gone farther. 
Much farther. 

Now this you must know of me 
—not only of me, but of all Mother’s 
children — if we can go from such 
danger, such risk, we go. Always. It 
can be counted upon. 

But I did not go. It was the true 

87 




artist, but also I confess one thing 
more: I was afraid of the man in 
the blue coveralls. 

And also, as true artist, there was 
this other consideration prevailing, 
that maybe something would go 
wrong. 

Oh, I did not wish this. 

^JO I went back to Mr. Hagsworth. 
^ It was not needed, really it was 
not. It was only insurance in the 
event that somehow my careful 
plans went wrong — that perhaps 
the French in Algeria should make 
contact (how? ridiculous! they 
could not have done it!) with the 
little male Aldebaranian in the ship 
I had made to land there, or that 
the Americans should somehow 
make contact with the Soviets and 
compare notes. Foolishness. But I 
went back, I wished to be there 
until the very end. Or nearly. And 
also there was that big, frightening 
man with the red face. 

Z-z-z~z-zit and I could have been 
away. 

But as things turned, I went back, 
and Mr. Hagsworth was on tele- 
phone, his eyes bright and angry. I 
thought I knew what he was hear- 
ing. I listened to hear if there were, 
perhaps, sounds from the closet, but 
there were none; good. Difficult as 
it was, I had tied well. And then 
Mr. Hagsworth looked up. 

He said, bleak: “I have news, 
Smith. It’s started.” 

“Started?” 



“Oh,” he said without patience, 
“you know what I’m talking about, 
Smith. The trouble’s started. These 
Aldebaranians of yours, they’ve 
stirred up a hornet’s nest, and now 
the stinging has begun. I just talked 
to the White House. There’s a defi- 
nite report of a nuclear explosion in 
the Mojave Desert.” 

“No!” 

“Yes,” he said, nodding, “there is 
no doubt. It can’t be anything but a 
Russian missile, though their aim 
is amazingly bad. Can it?” 

“What else possibly?” I asked 
with logic. “How terrible! And I 
suppose you have retaliated, hey? 
Sent a flight of missiles to Mos- 
cow?” 

“Of course. What else could we 
do?” 

He had put his finger on it, yes, 
he was right, I had computed it 
myself. 

“Nothing,” I said and wrung his 
hand, “and may the best country 
win.” 

“Or planet,” he said, nodding. 

“Planet?” I let go his hand. I 
looked. I waited. It was a time for 
astonish. I did not speak. 

Mr. Hagsworth said, speaking 
very slow: “Smith, that’s what I 
wanted to talk to you about.” 

“Talk,” I invited. 

Outside, there was sudden shout- 
ing. 

“They’ve heard about the bomb,” 
conjectured Mr. Hagsworth, but he 
paid no more attention. He said:

“In school, I knew a Fat Boy.” He 
said: “He always got his way. 
Everybody was afraid of him. But 
he never fought, he only divided 
others, do you see, and got them to 
fight each other.” 

I stood tall — yes, and brave! I 
dare use that word “brave,” it ap- 
plies. 

One would think that it would 
be like a human to say he is brave 
before a blinded fluttering moth, 
“brave” where there is no danger 
to be brave against; but though this 
was a human only, in that room I 
felt danger. Incredible, but it was 
so and I did not wish it. 

I said: “What are you talking 
about, Mr. Hagsworth?” 

“An idea I had,” he said softly 
with a face like death. “About a 
murderer. Maybe he comes from 
another planet and, for reasons of 
his own, wants to destroy our plan- 
et Maybe this isn’t the first one — 
he might have stopped, for exam- 
ple, at Aldebaran.” 

“I do not want to hear this,” I 
said, with true. 

OUT he did not stop. He said: 
“We human beings have faults 
and an outsider with brains and a 
lot of special knowledge — say, the 
kind of knowledge that could get a 
file folder into our records, in spite 
of all our security precautions — 
such an outsider might use our 
faults to destroy us. Senate Com- 
mittee hearings — why, some of

them have been a joke for years, 
and not a very funny one. Charac- 
ters have been destroyed, policies 
have been wrecked— why shouldn’t 
a war be started? Because politi- 
cians can be relied on to act in a 
certain way. And maybe this out- 
sider, having watched and studied 
us, knew something about Russian 
weaknesses too, and played on 
them in the same way. Do you see 
how easy it would be?” 

“Easy?” I cried, offended. 

“For someone with very special 
talents and ability,” he assured me. 
“For a Fat Boy. Especially for a 
Fat Boy who can go, faster than 
any human can follow, from here 
to Moscow, Moscow to Paris, Paris 
to the Mojave, Mojave to — where? 
Somewhere near Mars, let’s say at 
a guess. For such a person, wouldn’t 
it be easy?” 

I reeled, I reeled; but these mon- 
key tricks, they could not matter. 
I had planned too carefully for that, 
only how did they know? 

“Excuse me,” I said softly, “one 
moment,” and turned again to the 
room with the armchair. I felt I 
had made a mistake. But what mis- 
take could matter, I thought, when 
there was the armchair and, of 
course, z-z-z-z-zit? 

But that was a mistake also. 

The man in blue coveralls, he 
stood in the door but not smilingly. 
He held in his hand what I knew 
instantly was a gun. 

The armchair was there, yes, but 

89 




in it was of all strange unaccount- 
able people this chambermaid, who 
should have been bound in closet, 
and she too had a gun. 

“Miss Gonzalez,” introduced 
Hagsworth politely, “and Mr. 
Hechtmeyer. They are — well, 
G-men, though, as you can see, 
Miss Gonzalez is not a man. But she 
had something remarkable to tell 
us about you, when Mr. Hecht- 
meyer released her. She said that 
you seemed to have another shape 
when she saw you last. The shape 
of a sort of green-skinned octopus 
with bright red eyes. Ridiculous, 
isn’t it? Or is it?” 

Ruses were past. It was a time 
for candid. I said, “Like this?” ter- 
ribly, and I went quick to natural 
form. 

/"\H, what white faces! Oh, what 
v horror! It was remarkable 
that they did not turn and run. For 
that is Secret Weapon No. 1, for us 
of Tau Ceti on sanitation work; for 
our working clothes we assume the 
shape of those about us, certainly, 
but in case of danger we have mere- 
ly to resume our own. In all Galaxy 
(I do not know about Andromeda), 
there is no shape so fierce. Nine 
terrible arms. Fourteen piercing 
scarlet eyes. Teeth like Hessian 
bayonets. I ask you, would you not 
run? 

But they did not. Outside, a si- 
ren began with great frightening- 
ness to scream.

T CRIED: “Air attack!” It was 
fearful, the siren warned of 
atomic warheads on their way and 
this human woman, this Gonzalez, 
sat in my chair with pointing gun. 

“Go away,” I cried, “get out,” and 
rushed upon her, but she did not 
move. 

“Phaser I said thickly among 
my long teeth, but what was the 
use? She would not do it! 

They paled, they trembled, but 
they stayed. Well, I would have 
paled and trembled myself if it had 
been a Tau Cetan trait Instead, I 
merely went limp. Terror was not 
only on one side in that room, I con- 
fess it. 

“Please,” I begged, “I must go. It 
is the end of life on this planet and 
I do not wish to be here!” 

“You don’t have a choice,” said 
Mr. Hagsworth, his face like steel. 
“Gentlemen!” he called, “come in!” 

And through the door came sev- 
eral persons, some soldiers and 
some who were not. I looked with 
all my eyes; I could not have been 
more astonished. For there was — 
yes, Senator Schnell, gold tooth 
covered, face without smile; Sena- 
tor Loveless, white hair waving; 
and — oh, there was more. 

I could scarcely believe. 

Feeble, slow humans! They had

where he had been eighteen hours

before, yes, Comrade Tadjense- 
vitch, the old man, and M. Duples- 
sin, sadly meeting my eyes. It could 
not be. Almost I forgot the scream- 
‘ ing siren and the fear. 

“These gentlemen,” said Hags- 
worth with polite, “also would like 
to talk to you, Mr. Smith.” 

“Arakelian,” grunted the old man. 

•‘Monsieur Laplant,” corrected 
Duplessin. 

“Or,” said Hagsworth, “should 
we all call you by your right 
name?” 

Outside, the siren screamed. I 
could not move. 

“Please let me go!” I cried. 

“Where?” demanded old Tadjen- 
sevitch. “To Mars, Hero of Soviet 
Labor? Or farther this time?” 

“The bombs!” I cried. “Let me 
go! What about Hero of Soviet 
Labor?” 

The old man sighed. “The deco- 
ration Comrade Party Secretary 
gave you, it contains a micro-wave 
transmitter, very good. One of our 
sputniki now needs new parts.” 

“You suspected me?” I cried out 
of fear and astonish. 

“Of course the Russians sus- 
pected you, Plinglot,” Hagsworth 
scolded piildly. “We all did, even 
we Americans — and we are not, 
you know, a suspicious race. No,” 
he added thoughtfully, as though 
there were no bombs to fall, “our 
national characteristics are . 
what? The conventional carica- 
tures — the publicity hound, the 



pork-barrel Senator, the cut-throat 
businessman? Would you say that 
was a fair picture, Mr. Smith?” 

“I Plinglot!” 

“Yes, of course. Sorry. But that 
must be what you thought, because 
those are the stereotypes you acted 
on, and maybe they’re true enough 
— most of the time. Too much of 
the time. But not all the time, Plin- 
glot!” 

"lyr OW I fell to floor, perspiring a 
terrible smell. It is how we 
faint, so to speak. It was death, it 
was the end, and this man was bul- 
lying me without fear. 

“The Fat Boy,” said Mr. Hags- 
worth softly, “was strong. He could 
have whipped most of us. But in 
my last term he got licked. Guile 
and bluff; when at last the bluff was 
called, he gave up. He was a cow- 
ard.” 

“I give up, Mr. Hagsworth,” I 
wailed, “only let me go away from 
the bombs!” 

“I know you do,” he nodded. 
“What else? And — what, the 
bombs? There are no bombs. Look 
out the window.” 

In seconds I pulled myself to- 
gether, no one spoke. I went to 
window. Cruising up and down 
outside, a white truck, red cross, 
painted wtih word Ambulance, si- 
ren going. Only that. No air raid 
warning. Only one ambulance. 

“Did you think,” scolded Hags- 
worth with voice angry now, “that 



92 



GALAXY 




we would let you bluff us? There’s 
an old maxim — ‘Give a fool enough 
rope’ ~ we gave it to you, and we 
added a little. You see, we didn’t 
know you came from a race of 
cowards.” 

“I Plinglot!” I sobbed through all 
my teeth. “I am not a coward. I 
even tied this human woman here, 
ask her! It was brave, even Mother 
could not have done more! Why, I 
am the sector warden of this whole 
quadrant of Galaxy, indeed, to keep 
the peace!” 

“That much we know — and we 
know why,” nodded Hagsworth, 
“because you’re afraid; but we 
needed to know more. Well, now 
we do, and once M. Duplessin’s 
associates get a better means of 
communication with the little Alde- 
baranian, I expect we’ll know still 
more. It will be very helpful knowl- 
edge,” he added in thought. 

It was all, it was the end. I said 
sadly: “If only Great Mother could 
know Plinglot did his best! If only 
she could learn what strange people 
live here, whom I cannot under- 
stand.” 

“Oh,” said Mr. Hagsworth, gen- 
tle, “we’ll tell her for you, Plinglot,” 
he said. “Very soon, I think.”

on down, were covered with ice. 
Some temperature measurements 
had indicated that the temperature 
dropped as you went down in the 
ocean; logically, then, at one point 
it had to grow cold enough for 
the water to turn into ice. 

This theory was superseded 
around 1843 by the Abyssal Theo- 
ry of Edward Forbes who thought, 
as a result of studies he had made 
in the Mediterranean Sea, that life 
could not possibly exist below a 
depth of 300 fathoms. Of course 
the seas were deeper, but at 300 
fathoms there began the “azoic 
zone,” the lifeless area. 

This idea was very swiftly and 
very thoroughly disproved. In 
1850, Pastor Michael Sars, a Nor- 
wegian, found thriving life near 
the Lofoten Islands at 450 fathoms, 
and, soon after, life-forms from 
much greater depths were recov- 
ered for wholly practical reasons 
— a broken transatlantic cable was 
fished up in the Atlantic and an- 
other broken cable was fished up 
from the Mediterranean, both 
showing life-forms. Then Sir Wy- 
ville Thomas talked the British 
government into sending out ex- 
peditions for the purpose of explor- 
ing the bottom of the seas. 

At first he was given two small 
Navy vessels, the Lightning and 
the Porcupine, for work around 
the British Isles and in the Medi- 
terranean; then the corvette Chal- 
lenger went around the world on

up the narrative with the Valdivia 
expedition. 

N ATURALLY the German sci- 
entists, who, under the lead- 
ership of Professor Carl Chun, 
manned the Valdivia, had read all 
fifty quarto volumes which re- 
ported on the work of the Chal- 
lenger. They knew what had been 
done wrong or awkwardly on that 
first try. New and better nets and 
other equipment had been de- 
signed and constructed in the 
meantime. Consequently the Val- 
divia expedition did as well as the 
Challenger expedition in a shorter 
time. 

There was another improve- 
ment too. The Challenger expe- 
dition had lost over, a dozen men,

not due to accidents but to heat due south for the Canary Islands 
prostration, tropical diseases and and more or less followed the Afri- 
exhaustion. The Valdivia lost only can coast. From Capetown, course 
one man — ironically, he was the was SSW for the purpose of find- 
ship’s doctor. ing Bouvet Island if they could 

Leaving Hamburg on July 31, (they did), then east to Enderby 
1898, the Valdivia first sailed to Land on the coast of Antarctica, 
England— or, more precisely, Scot- from there up to Sumatra, then 
land, since they went to Edin- across the Indian Ocean to Dar-es- 
burgh; then she sailed around Salaam in East Africa, then north 
Scotland and Ireland, took course along the African coast to the Red

Sea. Then the Valdivia sailed the 
whole length of the Mediterranean 
Sea and around Spain back to 
Hamburg, which was reached on 
April 28, 1899. 

A member of the expedition re- 
called later that one of the first 
questions asked of him by a news- 
paper reporter was: “Did you 

catch any monsters of the deep?” 
The scientist replied that they had 
caught monsters all right, but that 
the reporter would not agree, so 
let’s call them bathypelagic fishes. 
To understand this exchange, it 
must be explained that the Ger- 
man word for monster is Unge- 
heuer, but the adjective ungeheuer- 
lich mostly means “gigantic.”

They were “monsters,” yes, but 
they were little. One of my child- 
hood memories is myself standing 
in front of the displays in the Mu- 
seum of Natural History in Berlin 
and marveling at the monsters. 
Why, they were all of so small a 
size that one could easily keep 
them in a fish tank at home! Build- 
ing a fish tank which could actual- 
ly do that would be a major en- 
gineering task. It would cost, I 
guess, around $15,000 and would 
still have the considerable disad- 
vantage of not letting you see 
what’s going on inside. 

'T'HERE were two small black 
misshapen fishes, each about 
three inches long (Fig. 1). Your 
first impression was that this was 
mainly a mouth. The teeth, though 
tiny, still looked both vicious and, 
strange to say, luminous. These 
two fishes, one taken in the Atlan- 
tic at a depth of 13,500 feet, the 
other in the Indian Ocean at a 
similar depth, had come up still 
alive and had lived on board the 
Valdivia for about an hour. They 
had been photographed in a dark 
room, and the teeth had been 
luminous, as had been the tip of 
the appendage growing out from 
between the eyes. 

Less frightening and more im- 
pressive in many respects was 
Gigantura (Fig. 2) which was 
labeled as a large representative of 
the fish fauna of the deep sea. Its 



eellike body was AVa inches long 
and it had been taken from a 
depth of 8250 feet. The whole 
body was the most beautiful 
mother-of-pearl color on a pink 
background; the long trailing tail 
(six inches of it) looked like 
silver threads. And the eyes were 
of a shape that had never been 
seen before; they were like built-in 
opera glasses. The scientific desig- 
nation, logically, was “telescope 
eyes.” 

Nor were these telescope eyes 
just an accomplishment of the 
fishes. Octopi had them too. There 
was a 4-inch octopus called Am- 
phitretus which also had telescope 
eyes (Fig. 3). It was colorless and 
looked somewhat translucent I 
can’t tell whether this was its 
natural appearance or whether be- 
ing preserved in alcohol had 
robbed it of what color it original- 
ly had. By the time I saw it, it 
had been in alcohol for some six- 
teen years and that, unfortunately, 
does cause bleaching, 

The men of the Valdivia seem 
to have been generally somewhat 
more lucky than the men of the 
Challenger because they quite 
often could still have a quick look 
at the living deep-sea animals. 
True, the creatures died soon 
thereafter, but they were still seen 
alive. It must have been a differ- 
ence of faster winches and general 
technical improvement in the 
catching equipment 



98 



GALAXY 




A T any event, the men ex- 
pressed their surprise at how 
colorful deep-sea life turned out 
to be. They probably had reasoned 
consciously that color did not 
matter in a permanently dark en- 
vironment, and then had drawn the 
subconscious conclusion that the 
denizens of the extreme deep would 
therefore be black. Well, the con- 
clusion had been wrong; the rea- 
soning should have stopped with 
the statement that color does not 
matter in a permanently dark en- 
vironment So the animals had 
color, only it did not matter. 

The fishes were mother-of-pearl 
color, or pink, or dark blue and 
sometimes black. The crabs, to 
everybody’s surprise, were usually 
pink or red. This again was one of 
the cases where reasoning, in this 
case the surprise, was based on 
previous experience. 

Even a zoologist, unless he hap- 
pens to be working on marine 
crustaceans right at the time, is 
likely to think of edible crabs, of 
lobsters and crayfish, when the 
word “crustacean” is mentioned. 
All these are dark-colored when 
alive and it is just the fact that 
they have turned red that an- 
nounces that they are ready to eat. 

If you ask a zoologist why, he 
will readily explain that the color 
of the living lobster or crayfish is 
due to two pigments in the shell. 
One is blue, the other red. It so 
happens that the blue pigment is 



destroyed by heat (it does not dis- 
solve in the cooking water, as you 
can sometimes read; if it did, the 
water would turn blue) so that 
only the heat-resistant red pigment 
is left. Hence the boiled crayfish 
and the broiled lobster are red. 

After finishing this explanation, 
the same zoologist will even point 
out that one can occasionally find 
crayfish in which one or both pig- 
ments are missing. If both are 
missing, the crayfish looks dirty 
white, of course. If the red pigment 
is missing, it looks a rather beau- 
tiful light steel blue, and if the 
blue pigment is missing, the cray- 
fish is pinkish red. 

Well, yes, that is what the man 
knows. The occasional reddish liv- 
ing crayfish is an unusual case. So, 
when he sees a netful of red crabs 
and prawns break the surface of the 
ocean, he is still surprised because 
they are all red. He did not ex- 
pect them to have the red pigment 
only. But they do. 

It must be said that the zoolo- 
gist, if he could spend some time 
at the bottom of the ocean, would 
not get used to red crabs and 
prawns either. If he were at the 
bottom of the Indian Ocean, where 
it is about 3500 feet deep, and sat 
perfectly still, he might see a red 
deep-sea prawn ( Nematocarcinus ) 
approach him. The picture would 
be something like Fig. 4. These 
crustaceans eject a luminous liquid, 
presumably to blind their enemies

when attacked, and it is reported 
that this liquid clings to their own 
bodies for a while. But in the light 
beam of a lamp, the crab would 
look red. 

H OWEVER, this discussion has 
taken me away from the 
showcase at the Natural History 
Museum in Berlin where I spent 
much time in wonder when I was 
about twelve. There were two es- 
pecially weird things in it Again 
they proved that, in the deep sea, 
color does not matter, for one was 



dead black and the other mother 
of pearl. 

The black one was Megalopha- 
rynx longicaudatus, which trans- 
lates as the “long-tailed big-gullet” 
(Fig. 5); the name isn’t very so- 
phisticated, but you can’t deny that 
it is descriptive. In size, the long- 
tailed big-gullet was considerable 
for its habitat, measuring 7 Vz 
inches in length. The scientists of 
the Valdivia were convinced that 
this was just the larval form of 
another fish and later discoveries 
proved them right. The adult is 
called the “pelican eel” (Eury- 
pharynx pelecanoides) and is now 
known. to occur in all oceans below 
the 3000-foot level. 

The last monster in that show- 
case was tiny, just a shade longer 
than one inch. It bore the name of 
Stylophthalmus Brauer and had 
been caught in the Indian Ocean 
at a depth of 6600 feet (Fig. 6). 
It also was a larval form. Why its 
eyes are on such long stalks is not

Fig. 9: A clasp-sea hotothurian, Scotoplanes, 
probably an inactive type 

known; larval forms do not al- 
ways make sense even though one 
wishes they would. 

It has just been mentioned that 
the pelican eel occurs in all oceans. 
Successive expeditions have tended 
to show that the fauna of the deep 
sea seems to be rather uniform, 
which, since the environment is 
rather uniform, is not really sur- 
prising. A fish caught in one ocean 
by one expedition at 4500 feet 
was caught by another expedition 
at 5000 feet in another ocean and 
by a third expedition at 3500 feet 
in still another ocean. The Val-

examples. 

Nor is this uniformity restricted 
to what the German scientist called, 
in self-defense, the bathypelagic

fishes. Nothing cuts an interview 
short like such a term, especially 
if you add that it cannot be trans- 
lated into what reporters call 
“words of one syllable.” (Incident- 
ally, they are not consistent; one 
of them once said to me that he 
wanted my “reply in interesting 
words of one syllable, not those 
linguistic monstrosities you scien- 
tists always use”; please note that 
be used only eight one-syllable 
words in fifteen.) Actually any 
scientific term — with the possible 
exception of a few mathematical 
concepts — can be either translated 
or at least explained. 

YV/’HEN it comes to marine 
” biology, the first concept is 
that of the “littoral zone.” Original- 
ly this term was defined as the 
zone between high and low tide, 
but in the course of time this has 
been liberalized to mean shallow 
water near the shore, generally. 

The opposite of littoral is pelagic 
(from Greek pelagos, meaning “of 
the sea”) which means everything 
far from the shore, beyond the 
horizon as seen by a man at the 
seashore. Pelagic then is subdi- 
vided into Nekton, which is every- 
thing that actively swims around, 
whether shark, porpoise or herring, 
and Plankton, which is everything 
that drifts around. If it swims or 
drifts above 500 feet of depth, it 
is “epipelagic .” If it swims or drifts 
deep down, it is “bathypelagic.” If 



it either cannot or does not move, 
it is “benthal” or “benthic.” 

That the bathypelagic fauna is 
rather uniform is not too surpris- 
ing, but the Valdivia found a simi- 
lar uniformity of the benthal forms. 
Figure 7 shows the deep-sea sea- 
star Styracaster. The one pictured 
was 2 3 A inches across and was 
dredged up from the Atlantic from 
about 8000 feet Another one just 
like it, but 6 inches across, was 
dredged from 17,000 feet in the 
Indian Ocean. Likewise crinoids 
(the Valdivia discovered several 
new species) were the same in 
widely separated areas. The same 
went for sponges. 

There are, it should be ex- 
plained, three main types of 
sponges. The best known of iiiein, 
the bath sponge, is a representa- 
tive of the “Homy Sponges.” Its 
structure consists of spongin fibers. 
The second group are the calcare- 
ous sponges, and the third the glass 
sponges with a silica skeleton. The 
glass sponges are often very beau- 
tiful and have shapes that remind 
the observer of artifacts — many 
look like intricate vases or bottles. 

Some of these glass sponges 
which had come on the market 
via Japan had actually been 
thought to be artificial and had 
been much admired as the product 
of Japanese glass blowers. To the 
best of my knowledge, the Japan- 
ese never had any special repu- 
tation as glass blowers, nor do I 



102 



GALAXY 




■know where the Japanese got 
them. The Valdivia found these 
types, which had been thought ar- 
tificial, in many places, always 
deep down, always alike, no mat- 
ter how far apart they grew. 

Naturally the Valdivia expedi- 
tion was not the last of its kind. 
It was follpwed one year later by 
the Dutch Siboga expedition under 
Professor Max Weber. Then fol- 
lowed a Norwegian deep-sea ex- 
pedition on a vessel which was 
named — what else? — the Michael 
Sars. There were American ex- 
peditions ( Albatross ), Danish ex- 
peditions on the ships Dana / and 
Dana II (these paid special atten- 
tion to the life history of the com- 
mon eel, still completely unknown 
as late as 1912), and finally the 
Danish Gafafhea expedition. 

I N the meantime, the problem 
was attacked from an entirely 
different angle. Most of what the 
Valdivia had found was, by defi- 
nition, benthic. It was either grown 
to the bottom, like those glass 
sponges, or else it was not likely 
to move far, like the seastars and 
even most of the fishes. Just how 
much bathypelagic life there ac- 
tually was remained to be inves- 
tigated, and the best way of doing 
it was to put a man in a position 
where he could observe it direct- 
ly. I am, of course, speaking of 
William Beebe’s bathysphere. 
William Beebe and his assist- 



ants were the first men to actually 
see bathypelagic fishes in their 
natural habitat and they were sur- 
prised at how much of it there 
was. All I can do is to urge you 
to read William Beebe’s Half Mile 
Down which was reprinted in 1951 
and is still available. 

Since I am recommending 
books, I’ll go on and recommend 
equally strongly that you spend 
two or three hours with The 
Galathea Deep Sea Expedition 
(published last year by the Mac- 
millan Company) which produced 
results every bit as interesting as 
those of the Challenger and the 
Valdivia. 

The Galathea expedition (it 
took place during the years 1950- 
1952) confirmed the earlier im- 
pression that the bathypelagic 
fauna was of worldwide distribu- 
tion. The fish Bathymicrops is an 
insignificant-looking small and 
blind fish, but it is widely distribu- 
ted. It was caught in the North 
Atlantic 16,500 feet down by the 
Michael Sars, three times in the 
Atlantic by the Albatross (at 
14,000 feet off Northwest Africa, 
at 18,000 feet in mid-Atlantic near 
the equator and at 17,000 feet 
near the North Coast of South 
America), and three times by the 
Galathea (at about 15,000 feet 
near the southern tip of Africa, at 
about 16,000 feet off the African 
East Coast near the equator, and 
at 19,300 feet just north of the

103 




North Island of New Zealand). 

The route of the Galathea was 
similar to that of the Valdivia: 
from Copenhagen through the 
English Channel, down the West 
Coast of Africa, up the East Coast 
to the Seychelles Islands, across 
the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, then 
through the Sunda Sea to Aus- 
tralia, around New Zealand, up 
to Hawaii, then to San Francisco, 
from there to the Panama Canal 
and, cutting across the Atlantic, 
back to Copenhagen. 

The Galathea secured a number 
of specimens of the invertebrate 
life of the abyssal regions which do 
not seem to belong to Earth. A 
deep-sea cucumber ( Scotoplanes ) 
measuring about 3 3 A inches in 
length was found off the Philip- 
pines at 22,000 and at 33,000 feet. 
Probably it spends its life buried 
in the mud (Fig. 9). 

An even more unusual-looking 
holothurian (sea cucumber, that 
is) was taken from about 18,000 
feet from the bottom between the 
northern end of Madagascar and 
the African mainland. Eight speci- 
mens of Psychropotes (Fig. 10) 
were taken in one haul, the largest 
being a foot in length, the smallest 
eight inches. They probably plow 
through the ooze, hunting worms. 

Fig. 11 shows a rather large 
crustacean (one of the so-called 
amphipods) taken by the Galathea 
in the Indian Ocean from depths 
up to 16,000 feet. This crustacean 



seems to be swimming some dis- 
tance above the bottom as well as 
moving around on the bottom. It 
grows to a length of about four 
inches. 

TVTOW, an even dozen expedi- 
■*- * tions after Michael Sars’ first 
probing of the deep sea, we can 
make a few generalizations. 

To begin with, no place in the 
deep sea, which, after all, covers 
about 60 per cent of the Earth’s 
surface, is completely lifeless. In 
general, it seems that the life-forms 
are smaller the deeper you go, but 
some surprises in that respect are 
easily possible. So far, the areas 
which the Challenger men entered 
as “red ooze” on their charts seem 
to have the smallest number of in- 
habitants per square mile. The 
fauna of the deepest deep sea 
seems to be essentially benthic; ap- 
parently food is so scarce that ob- 
taining it is largely accidental, so 
that it makes little difference 
whether the organism moves 
around actively searching for food 
or just lies in wait. 

The absolutely sessile forms are 
too far down in the scale of evo- 
lution to have developed luminous 
organs, especially since a number 
of them, the sponges, are eyeless 
under any circumstances. 

Crustaceans can, as has been 
mentioned, eject a luminous liquid. 
Luminous orgarts have been found, 
to the best of my knowledge, only 



104 



GALAXY 




on fishes and on octopi. In both 
cases, the animal seems to be able 
to control these organs, to be able 
to switch them on or off. Crusta- 
ceans and fishes, as well as octopi, 
have gone to both extremes as re- 
gards eyes. They either are com- 
pletely blind or they have devel- 
oped the largest eyes for their body 
size known to naturalists. 

It appears that none of the 
forms inhabiting the deep sea orig- 
inated there. They, or rather their 
ancestors, all seem to have mi- 
grated from higher layers. 

The research work was deter- 
mined at the beginning by the de- 
sire to find out how far life ex- 
tended into the depth. It was only 
natural to investigate the sea bot- 



tom first, after it had been learned 
that there was something to in- 
vestigate. The deep sea which is 
not near the bottom has been 
somewhat neglected by compar- 
ison. But we already know that it 
is richer in life than the bottom 
itself. 

One is naturally tempted, at this 
point in history, to compare the 
deep sea to space. The comparison 
is easy. In both cases, we know 
it is there. In both cases, we know 
it is immense in extent. In both 
cases, we know there is something 
to investigate. 

And, in both cases, we have to 
start any discussion with the 
words: “We have only just begun”

“It is permitted,” Kemmer said

of the occasion. 

He watched humorlessly as the 
Antarian slithered out of the office 
with a flutter of colorful ceremonial 
robes. Both Kemmer and Shifax 
had known for weeks that John-

son was a spy, but the native had 
to go through this insane rigmarole 
before the rules on Antar would 
allow him to act At any rate, the 
formalities were over at last and 
the affair should be satisfactorily 
ended before nightfall. Natives 
moved quickly enough, once the 
preliminaries were concluded- 

Kemmer leaned back in his 
chair and sighed. Being the Inter- 
world Corporation’s local manager 
had more compensations than 
headaches, despite the rigid ritual- 
ism of native society. Since most 
of the local population was under 
his thumb, counter-espionage was 
miraculously effective. This fellow 
Johnson, for instance, had been 
in Vaornia less than three weeks, 
and despite the fact that he was 
an efficient and effective snoop, 
he had been fingered less than for- 
ty-eight hours after his arrival in 
the city. 

Kemmer closed his eyes and let 
a smile cross his keen features. 
Under his administration, there 
would be a sharp rise in the mor- 
tality curve for spies detected in 
the Vaornia-Lagash-Timargh tri- 
angle. With the native judiciary 
firmly under IC control, the Cor- 
poration literally had a free hand, 
providing it kept its nose super- 
ficially clean. And as for spies, they 
knew the chances they took and 
what the penalty could be for in- 
terfering with the normal opera- 
tions of corporate business. 



Kemmer yawned, stretched, 
turned his attention to more im- 
portant matters. 

A LBERT Johnson fumbled 
hopefully in the empty food 
container before tossing it aside. A 
plump, prosaic man of middle 
height, with a round ingenuous 
face, Albert was as undistinguished 
as his name, a fact that made him 
an excellent investigator. But he 
was neither undistinguished nor 
unnoticed in his present position, 
although he had tried to carry it 
off by photographing the actions 
of the local Sanitary Processional 
like any tourist. 

He had been waiting near the 
Vaornia Arm on the road that led 
to Lagash since early afternoon, 
and now it was nearly evening. He 
cursed mildly at the fact that the 
natives had no conception of time, 
a trait not exclusively Antarian, 
but one which was developed to a 
high degree on this benighted 
planet. And the fact that he was 
hungry didn’t add to his good tem- 
per. Natives might be able to fast 
for a week without ill effects, but 
his chunky body demanded quan- 
tities of nourishment at regular 
intervals, and his stomach was pro- 
testing audibly at being empty. 

He looked around him, at the 
rutted road, and at the darkening 
Vaornia Arm of the Devan Forest 
that bordered the roadway. The 
Sanitary Processional had corn-

pleted the daily ritual of waste 
disposal and the cart drivers and 
censer bearers were goading their 
patient daks into a faster gait. It 
wasn’t healthy to be too near the 
forest after the sun went down. 
The night beasts weren’t particu- 
lar about what, or whom, they ate. 

The Vaomese used the Vaornia 
Arm as a dump for the refuse of 
the city, a purpose admirably apt, 
for the ever-hungry forest life sel- 
dom left anything uneaten by 
morning. And since Antarian towns 
had elaborate rituals concerning 
the disposal of waste, together with 
a nonexistent sewage system, the 
native atttiude of fatalistic indif- 
ference to an occasional tourist or 
Antarian being gobbled up by 
some nightmare denizen of. the 
forest was understandable. 

The fact that the Arm was also 
an excellent place to dispose of 
an inconvenient body didn’t occur 
to Albert until the three natives 
with knives detached themselves 
from the rear of the Sanitary 
Processional and advanced upon 
him. They came from three 
directions, effectively boxing him 
in, and Albert realized with a sick 
certainty that he had been double- 
crossed, that Shifaz, instead of be- 
ing an informant for him, was 
working for the IC. Albert turned 
to face the nearest native, tensing 
his muscles for battle. 

Then he saw the Zark. 

It stepped out of the gathering 



darkness of the forest, and with 
its appearance everything stopped. 
For perhaps a micro-second, the 
three Vaomese stood frozen. Then, 
with a simultaneous wheep of ter- 
ror, they turned and ran for the 
city. 

They might have stayed and 
finished their work if they had 
known it was a Zark, but at the 
moment the Zark was energizing 
a toothy horror that Earthmen 
called a Bandersnatch — an insane 
combination of talons, teeth and 
snakelike neck mounted on a croc- 
odilian body that exuded an odor 
of putrefaction from the carrion 
upon which it normally fed. The 
Bandersnatch had been dead for 
several hours, but neither the na- 
tives nor Albert knew that 

TT was a tribute to the Zark’s 
ability to maintain pseudo-life 
in a Bandersnatch carcass that the 
knifemen fled and a similar panic 
seized the late travelers on the 
road. Albert stared with horrified 
fascination at the monstrosity for 
several seconds before he, too, 
fled. Any number of natives with 
knives were preferable to a Ban- 
dersnatch. He had hesitated only 
because he didn’t possess the con- 
ditioned reflexes arising from gen- 
erations of exposure to Antarian 
wildlife. 

He was some twenty yards be- 
hind the rearmost native, and, 
though not designed for speed, was

actually gaining upon the fellow, 
when his foot struck a loose cob- 
blestone in the road. Arms flail- 
ing, legs pumping desperately to 
balance his toppling mass, Albert 
fought manfully against the forces 
of gravity and inertia. 

He lost. 

His head struck another up- 
turned cobble. His body twitched 
once and then relaxed limply and 
unconscious upon the dusty road. 

The Zark winced a little at the 
sight, certain that this curious crea- 
ture had damaged itself seriously. 

Filled with compassion, it started 
forward on the Bandersnatch’s 
four walking legs, the grasping 
talons crossed on the breast in an 
attitude of prayer. The Zark 
wasn’t certain what it could do, 
but perhaps it could help. 

Albert was mercifully uncon- 
scious as it bent over him to in- 
spect his prone body with a pur- 
ple-lidded pineal eye that was blue 
with concern. The Zark noted the 
bruise upon his forehead and 
marked his regular breathing, and 
came to the correct conclusion 
that, whatever had happened, the 
biped was relatively undamaged. 
But the Zark didn’t go away. It 
had never seen a human in its 
thousand-odd years of existence, 
which was not surprising since 
Earthmen had been on Antar less 
than a decade and Zarks seldom 
left the forest 

Albert began to stir before the 



Zark remembered its present con- 
dition. Not being a carnivore, it 
saw nothing appetizing about Al- 
bert, but it was energizing a Ban- 
dersnatch, and, like all Zarks, it 
was a purist. A living Bander- 
snatch would undoubtedly drool 
happily at the sight of such a 
tempting tidbit, so the Zark opened 
the three-foot jaws and drooled. 

Albert chose this precise time 
to return to consciousness. He 
turned his head groggily and 
looked up into a double row of 
saw-edged teeth surmounted by a 
leering triangle of eyes. A drop 
of viscid drool splattered moistly 
on his forehead, and as the awful 
face above him bent closer to his 
own, he fainted. 

The Zark snapped its jaws dis- 
approvingly. This was not the 
proper attitude to take in the pres- 
ence of a ferocious monster. One 
simply didn’t go to sleep. One 
should attempt to run. The biped’s 
act was utterly illogical. It needed 
investigation. 

i^URIOUSLY, the Zark sent out 
^ a pseudopod of its substance 
through the open mouth of its dis- 
guise. The faintly glittering thread 
oozed downward and struck Al- 
bert’s head beside his right eye. 
Without pausing, the thread sank 
through skin and connective tis- 
sue, circled the eyeball and located 
the optic nerve. It raced inward 
along the nerve trunk, split at the 



110 



GALAXY 




optic chiasma, and entered the 
corpora quadrigemina where it 
branched into innumerable micro- 
scopic filaments that followed the 
main neural paths of the man’s 
brain, probing the major areas of 
thought and reflex. 

The Zark quivered with pleas- 
ure. The creature was beautifully 
complex, and, more important, un- 
tenanted. He would make an in- 
teresting host. 

The Zark didn’t hesitate. It 
needed a host; giving its present 
mass of organic matter pseudo-life 
took too much energy. The Ban- 
dersnatch collapsed with a faint 
slurping sound. A blob of iridescent 
jelly flowed from the mouth and 
spread itself evenly over Albert’s 
body in a thin layer. The jelly 
shimmered, glowed, disappeared 
inward through Albert’s clothing 
and skin, diffusing through the sub- 
cutaneous tissues, sending hair- 
like threads along nerve trunks 
and blood vessels until the threads 
met other threads and joined, and 
the Zark became a network of pro- 
toplasmic tendrils that ramified 
through Albert’s body. 

Immediately the Zark turned 
its attention to the task of adapt- 
ing itself to its new host. Long ago 
it had learned that this had to be 
done quickly or the host did not 
survive. And since the tissues of 
this new host were considerably 
different from those of the Ban- 
dersnatch, a great number of struc- 



tural and chemical changes had to 
be made quickly. With some dis- 
may, the Zark realized that its 
own stores of energy would be in- 
sufficient for the task. It would 
have to borrow energy from the 
host — which was a poor way to 
start a symbiotic relationship. Or- 
dinarily, one gave before taking. 

Fortunately, Albert possessed 
considerable excess fat, an excel- 
lent source of energy whose re- 
moval would do no harm. There 
was plenty here for both Albert 
and itself. The man’s body twitched 
and jerked as the Zark’s protean 
cells passed through the adaptive 
process, and as the last leukocyte 
recoiled from tissue that had sud- 
denly become normal, his con- 
sciousness returned. Less than ten 
minutes had passed, but they were 
enough. The Zark was safely in 
harmony with its new host. 

Albert opened his eyes and 
looked wildly around. The land- 
scape was empty of animate life 
except for the odorous carcass of 
the Bandersnatch lying beside him. 
Albert shivered, rose unsteadily to 
his feet and began walking toward 
Vaomia. That he didn’t run was 
only because he couldn’t. 

He found it hard to believe that 
he was still alive. Yet a hurried in- 
spection convinced him that there 
wasn’t a tooth mark on him. It 
was a miracle that left him feel- 
ing vaguely uneasy. He wished he 
knew what had killed that grinning 



NSIDEKICK 



111 




horror so opportunely. But then, 
on second thought, maybe it was 
better that he didn’t know. There 
might be things in the Devan 
Forest worse than a Bandersnatch. 

"TNSIDE the city walls, Vaornia 
struck a three-pronged blow at 
Albert’s senses. Sight, hearing and 
smell were assaulted simultaneous- 
ly. Natives slithered past, garbed 
in long robes of garish color. Sibi- 
lant voices cut through the even- 
ing air like thin-edged knives 
clashing against the grating screech 
of the ungreased wooden wheels 
of dak carts. Odors of smoke, cook- 
ing, spices, perfume and corrup- 
tion mingled with the all-pervasive 
musky stench of unwashed Vaor- 
nese bodies. 

It was old to Albert, but new 
and exciting to the Zark. Its taps 
on Albert’s sense organs brought 
a flood of new sensation the Zark 
had never experienced. It mar- 
veled at the crowded buildings 
studded with jutting balconies and 
ornamental carvings. It stared at 
the dak caravans maneuvering with 
ponderous delicacy through the 
swarming crowds. It reveled in the 
colorful banners and awnings of 
the tiny shops lining the streets, 
and the fluttering robes of the na- 
tives. Color was something new to 
the Zark. Its previous hosts had 
been color blind, and the symbiont 
wallowed in an orgy of bright sen- 
sation. 



If Albert could have tuned in 
on his fellow traveler’s emotions, 
he probably would have laughed. 
For the Zark was behaving precise- 
ly like the rubbernecking tourist he 
himself was pretending to be. But 
Albert wasn’t interested in the 
sights, sounds or smells, nor did 
the natives intrigue him. There 
was only one of them he cared to 
meet — that slimy doublecrosser 
called Shifaz who had nearly 
conned him into a one-way ticket. 

Albert plowed heedlessly through 
the crowd, using his superior mass 
to remove natives from his path. 
By completely disregarding the 
code of conduct outlined by the 
IC travel bureau, he managed to 
make respectable progress toward 
the enormous covered area in the 
center of town that housed the 
Kazlak, or native marketplace. 
Shifaz had a stand there where he 
was employed as a tourist guide. 

The Zark, meanwhile, was not 
idle despite the outside interests. 
The majority of its structure was 
busily engaged in checking and 
cataloguing the body of its host, an 
automatic process that didn’t in- 
terfere with the purely intellec- 
tual one of enjoying the new sen- 
sations. Albert’s body wasn’t in 
too bad shape. A certain amount of 
repair work would have to be done, 
but despite the heavy padding of 
fat, the organs were in good work- 
ing condition. 

The Zark ruminated briefly 



112 



GALAXY 




over what actions it should take 
as it dissolved a milligram of 
cholesterol out of Albert’s aorta 
and strengthened the weak spot in 
the blood vessel with a few cells of 
its own substance until Albert’s 
tissues could fill the gap. Its knowl- 
edge of human physiology was in- 
complete, but it instinctively recog- 
nized abnormality. As a result, it 
could help the host’s physical con- 
dition, which was a distinct satis- 
faction, for a Zark must be help- 
ful. 

^ HIFAZ was at his regular stand, 
^ practicing his normal profes- 
sion of guide. As Albert ap- 
proached, he was in the midst of 
describing the attractions of the 
number two tour to a small knot of 
fascinated tourists. 

•‘And then, in the center of the 
Kazlak, we will come to the Hall 
of the Brides — Antar’s greatest 
marriage market It has been ar- 
ranged for you to actually see a 
mating auction in progress, but 
we must hurry or—” Shifaz looked 
up to see Albert shouldering the 
tourists aside. His yellow eyes 
widened and his hand darted to his 
girdle and came up with a knife. 

The nearest tourists fell back in 
alarm as he hissed malevolently at 
Albert, “Stand back, Earthman, or 
I’ll let the life out of your scale- 
less carcass!” 

“Doublecrosser,” Albert said, 
moving in. One meaty hand closed 



over the knife hand and wrenched 
while the other caught Shifaz 
alongside the head with a smack 
that sounded loud in the sudden 
quiet. Shifaz did a neat backflip 
and lay prostrate, the tip of his 
tail twitching reflexively. 

One of the tourists screamed. 

“No show today, folks,” Albert 
said. “Shifaz has another engage- 
ment.” He picked the Antarian up 
by a fold of his robe and shook 
him like a dirty dustcloth. A num- 
ber of items cascaded out of hid- 
den pockets, among which was an 
oiled-silk pouch. Albert dropped 
the native and picked up the 
pouch, opened it, sniffed, and 
nodded. 

It fitted. Things were clearer 
now. 

He was still nodding when two 
Earthmen in IC uniform stepped 
out of the crowd. “Sorry, sir,” the 
bigger of the pair said, “but you 
have just committed a violation 
of the IC-Antar Compact I’m 
afraid we’ll have to take you in.” 

“This lizard tried to have me 
killed,” Albert protested. 

“I wouldn’t know about that,” 
the IC man said. “You’ve assaulted 
a native, and that’s a crime. You’d 
better come peaceably with us — 
local justice is rather primitive 
and unpleasant.” 

“I’m an Earth citizen—” Albert 
began. 

“This world is on a commercial 
treaty.” The guard produced a 



INSIDEKICK 



113 




blackjack and tapped the shot- 
filled leather in his palm. “It’s our 
business to protect people like you 
from the natives, and if you insist, 
we’ll use force.” 

“I don’t insist, but I think you’re 
being pretty high-handed.” 

“Your objection has been 
noted,” the IC man said, “and will 
be included in the official report 
Now come along or we’ll be in the 
middle of a jurisdictional hassle 
when the native cops arrive. The 
corporation doesn’t like hassles. 
They’re bad for business.” 

T HE two IC men herded him 
into a waiting ground car and 
drove away. It was all done very 
smoothly, quietly and efficiently. 
The guards were good. 

And so was the local detention 
room. It was clean, modern and— 
Albert noted wryly — virtually es- 
cape-proof. Albert was something 
of an expert on jails, and the thick 
steel bars, the force lock, and the 
spy cell in the ceiling won his 
grudging respect. 

He sighed and sat down on the 
cot which was the room’s sole ar- 
ticle of furniture. He had been a 
fool to let his anger get the better 
of him. IC would probably use this 
brush with Shifaz as an excuse to 
send him back to Earth as an un- 
desirable tourist — which would be 
the end of his mission here, and a 
black mark on a singularly un- 
spotted record. 



Of course, they might not be so 
gentle with him if they knew that 
he knew they were growing to- 
bacco. But he didn’t think that 
they would know — and if they 
had checked his background, they 
would find that he was an investi- 
gator for the Revenue Service. 
Technically, criminal operations 
were not his affair. His field was 
tax evasion. 

He didn’t worry too much about 
the fact that Shifaz had tried to 
kill him. On primitive worlds like 
this, that was a standard proced- 
ure — it was less expensive to kill 
an agent than bribe him or pay 
honest taxes. He was angry with 
himself for allowing the native to 
trick him. 

He shrugged. By all rules of the 
game, IC would now admit about a 
two per cent profit on their Antar 
operation rather than the four per 
cent loss they had claimed, and pay 
up like gentlemen — and he would 
get skinned by the Chief back at 
Earth Central for allowing IC to 
unmask him. His report on tobacco 
growing would be investigated, but 
with the sketchy information he 
possessed, his charges would be im- 
possible to prove — and IC would 
have plenty of time to bury the 
evidence. 

If Earth Central hadn’t figured 
that the corporation owed it some 
billion megacredits in back taxes, 
he wouldn’t be here. He had been 
dragged from his job in the Gen- 



114 



GALAXY 




eral Accounting Office, for every 
field man and ex-field man was 
needed to conduct the sweeping 
investigation. Every facet of the 
sprawling IC operation was being 
checked. Even minor and out-of- 
the-way spots like Antar were on 
the list — spots that normally de- 
manded a cursory once-over by a 
second-class business technician. 

S UPERFICIALLY, Antar had 
the dull unimportance of an 
early penetration. There were the 
usual trading posts, pilot plants, 
wholesale and retail trade, and 
tourist and recreation centers — all 
designed to accustom the native in- 
habitants to the presence of Earth- 
men and their works— and set them 
up for the commercial kill, after 
they had acquired a taste for the 
products of civilization. But al- 
though the total manpower and 
physical plant for a world of this 
size was right, its distribution was 
wrong. 

A technician probably wouldn't 
see it, but to an agent who had dealt 
with corporate operations for nearly 
a quarter of a century, the setup 
felt wrong. It was not designed for 
maximum return. The Vaornia- 
Lagash-Timargh triangle held even 
more men and material then Prime 
Base. That didn’t make sense. It 
was inefficient, and IC was not 
noted for inefficiency. 

Not being oriented criminally, 
Albert found out IC’s real reason 



for concentration in this area only 
by absent-mindedly lighting a cig- 
arette one day in Vaornia. He had 
realized almost instantly that this 
was a gross breach of outworld 
ethics and had thrown the cigarette 
away. It landed between a pair of 
Vaornese walking by. 

The two goggled at the cigarette, 
sniffed the smoke rising from it, and 
with simultaneous whistles of sur- 
prise bent over to pick it up. Their 
heads collided with some force. The 
cigarette tore in their greedy grasp 
as they hissed hatefully at each 
other for a moment, before turning 
hostile glares in his direction. From 
their expressions, they thought this 
was a low Earthie trick to rob them 
of their dignity. Then they stalked 
off, their neck scales ruffled in an- 
ger, shreds of the cigarette still 
clutched in their hands. 

Even Albert couldn’t miss the 
implications. His tossing the butt 
away had produced the same re- 
action as a deck of morphine on a 
group of human addicts. Since IC 
wouldn’t corrupt a susceptible race 
with tobacco when there were much 
cheaper legal ways, the logical an- 
swer was that it wasn’t expensive on 
this planet — which argued that 
Antar was being set up for planta- 
tion operations — in which case to- 
bacco addiction was a necessary 
prerequisite and the concentration 
of IC population made sense. 

Now tobacco, as any Earthman 
knew, was the only monopoly in the 



INSIDEKICK 



115 




Confederation, and Earth had 
maintained that monopoly by 
treaty and by force, despite numer- 
ous efforts to break it There were 
some good reasons for the policy, 
ranging all the way from vice con- 
trol to taxable income, but the lat- 
ter was by far the most important. 
The revenue supported a consider- 
able section of Earth Central as 
well as the huge battle fleet that 
maintained peace and order along 
the spacelanes and between the 
worlds. 

But a light-weight, high-profit 
item like tobacco was a constant 
temptation to any sharp operator 
who cared more for money than for 
law, and IC filled that definition 
perfectly. In the Tax Section’s 
book, the Interworld Corporation 
was a corner-cutting, profit-grab- 
bing chiseler. Its basic character 
had been the same for three cen- 
turies, despite all the complete turn- 
overs in staff. Albert grinned wryly. 
The old-timers were right when 
they made corporations legal per- 
sons. 

Cigarettes which cost five credits 
to produce and sold for as high as 
two hundred would always interest 
a crook, and, as a consequence, 
Earth Central was always investi- 
gating reports of illegal plantations. 
They were found and destroyed 
eventually, and the owners pun- 
ished. But the catch lay in the word 
“eventually.” And if the operator 
was a corporation, no regulatory 



agency in its right mind would dare 
apply the full punitive power of the 
law. In that direction lay political 
suicide, for nearly half the popula- 
tion of Earth got dividends or salar- 
ies from them. 

That, of course, was the trouble 
with corporations. They invariably 
grew too big and too powerful. But 
to break them up as the Ancients 
did was to destroy their efficiency. 
What was really needed was a cor- 
porate conscience. 

Albert chuckled. That was a 
nice unproductive thought 

"C 1 RED Kemmer received the 
news that Albert had been 
taken to detention with a philoso- 
phic calm that lasted for nearly half 
an hour. By morning, the man 
would be turned over to the Patrol 
in Prime Base. The Patrol would 
support the charge that Albert was 
an undesirable tourist and send him 
home to Earth. 

But the philosophic calm de- 
parted with a frantic leap when 
Shifaz reported Johnson’s inspec- 
tion of the oiled-silk pouch. Raw 
tobacco was something that 
shouldn’t be within a thousand par- 
sects of Antar; its inference would 
be obvious even to an investigator 
interested only in tax revenues. 
Kemmer swore at the native. The 
entire operation would have to be 
aborted now and his dreams of pro- 
motion would vanish. 

“It wasn’t my supply,” Shifaz 

GALAXY 



116 




protested. “I was carrying it down 
to Karas at the mating market. He 
demands a pack every time he puts 
a show on for your silly Earth ie 
tourists.” 

“You should have concealed it 
better.” 

“How was I to know that chubby 
slob was coming back alive? And 
who’d have figured that he could 
handle me?” 

“I've told you time and again 
that Earthmen are tough customers 
when they get mad, but you had to 
learn it the hard way. Now we’re all 
in the soup. The Patrol doesn’t like 
illicit tobacco planters. Tobacco is 
responsible for their pay ” 

“But he’s still in your hands and 
he couldn’t have had time to trans- 
mit his information ” Shifaz said. 
“You can still kill him.” 

Kemmer’s face cleared. Sure, 
that was it. Delay informing the 
Patrol and knock the snoop off. The 
operation and Kemmer’s future 
were still safe. But it irked him that 
he had panicked instead of think- 
ing. It just went to show how being 
involved in major crime ruined the 
judgment. He’d have Johnson fixed 
up with a nice hearty meal — and 
he’d see that it was delivered per- 
sonally. At this late date, he couldn’t 
afford the risk of trusting a sub- 
ordinate. 

Kemmer’s glower became a 
smile. The snoop’s dossier indicated 
that he liked to eat. He should die 
happy. 



W ITH a faint click, a loaded 
tray passed through a slot in 
the rear wall of Albert Johnson’s 
cell. 

The sight and smell of Earthly 
cooking reminded him that he 
hadn’t anything to eat for hours. His 
mouth watered as he lifted the tray 
and carried it to the cot. At least IC 
wasn’t going to let him starve to 
death, and if this was any indication 
of the way they treated prisoners, 
an IC jail was the best place to be 
on this whole planet. 

Since it takes a little time for 
substances to diffuse across the in- 
testinal epithelium and enter the 
circulation, the Zark had some 
warning of what was about to hap- 
pen from the behavior of the epi- 
thelial cells lining Albert’s gut. As 
a result, a considerable amount of 
the alkaloid was stopped before it 
entered Albert’s body — but some 
did pass through, for the Zark was 
not omnipotent. 

For nearly five minutes after fin- 
ishing the meal, Albert felt nor- 
mally full and comfortable. Then 
hell broke loose. Most of the food 
came back with explosive violence 
and cramps bent him double. The 
Zark turned to the neutralization 
and elimination of the poison. Ab- 
sorptive surfaces were sealed off, 
body fluids poured into the intes- 
tinal tract, and anti-substances 
formed out of Albert’s energy re- 
serve to neutralize whatever alka- 
loid remained. 



NSIDEK1CK 



117 




None of the Zark's protective 
measures were normal to Albert’s 
body, and with the abrupt deple- 
tion of blood glucose to supply the 
energy the Zark required, Albert 
passed into hypoglycemic shock. 
The Zark regretted that, but it had 
no time to utilize his other less^ 
readily available energy sources. In 
fact, there was no time for anything 
except the most elemental protec- 
tive measures. Consequently the 
convulsions, tachycardia, and coma 
had to be ignored. 

Albert’s spasms were mercifully 
short, but when the Zark was fin- 
ished, he lay unconscious on the 
floor, his body twitching with in- 
coordinate spasms, while a fright- 
ened guard called in an alarm to 
the medics. 

The Zark quivered with its own 
particular brand of nausea. It had 
not been hurt by the. alkaloid, but 
the pain of its host left it sick with 
self-loathing. That it had estab- 
lished itself in a life-form that casu- 
ally ingested deadly poisons was 
no excuse. It should have been 
more alert, more sensitive to the 
host’s deficiencies. It had saved his 
life, which was some compensation, 
and there was much that could be 
done in the way of restorative and 
corrective measures that would pre- 
vent such a thing from occurring 
again — but the Zark was unhappy 
as it set about helping Albert’s liver 
metabolize fat to glucose and re- 
store blood sugar levels. 



T HE medic was puzzled. She 
had seen some peculiar condi- 
tions at this station, but hypogly- 
cemic shock was something new. 
And, being unsure of herself, she 
ordered Albert into the infirmary 
for observation. The guard, of 
course, didn’t object, and Kemmer, 
when he heard of it, could only 
grind his teeth in frustration. He 
was on delicate enough ground 
without making it worse by not 
taking adequate precautions to pre- 
serve the health of his unwilling 
guest. Somehow that infernal snoop 
had escaped again. 

Albert moved his head with in- 
finite labor and looked at the intra- 
venous apparatus dripping a color- 
less solution into the vein in the 
elbow joint of his extended left arm. 
He felt no pain, but his physical 
weakness was appalling. He could 
move only with the greatest effort, 
and the slightest exertion left him 
dizzy and breathless. It was ob- 
vious that he had been poisoned, 
and that it was a miracle of provi- 
dence that he had survived. It was 
equally obvious that a reappraisal 
of his position was in order. Some- 
one far higher up the ladder than 
Shifaz was responsible for this la- 
test attempt on his life. The native 
couldn’t possibly have reached him 
in the safety of IC’s jail. 

The implications were unpleas- 
ant. Someone important feared him 
enough to want him dead, which 
meant that his knowledge of illicit 



118 



GALAXY 




tobacco was not as secret as he 
thought It would be suicide to stay 
in the hands of the IC any longer. 
Somehow he had to get out and in- 
form the Patrol. 

He looked at the intravenous 
drip despondently. If the solution 
was poisoned, there was no help for 
him. It was already half gone. But 
he didn’t feel too bad, outside of 
being weak. It probably was all 
right. In any event, he would have 
to take it. The condition of his body 
wouldn’t permit anything else. 

He sighed and relaxed on the 
bed, aware of the drowsiness that 
was creeping over him. When he 
awoke, he would do something 
about this situation, but he was 
sleepy now. 

A LBERT awoke strong and re- 
freshed. He was as hungry as 
he always was before breakfast. 
Whatever was in that solution, it 
had certainly worked miracles. As 
far as he could judge, he was com- 
pletely normal. 

The medic was surprised to find 
him sitting up when she made her 
morning rounds. It was amazing, 
but this case was amazing in more 
ways than one. Last night he had 
been in a state of complete col- 
lapse, and now he was well on the 
road to recovery. 

Albert looked at her curiously. 
“What was in that stuff you gave 
me?” 

“Just dextrose and saline,” she 



said. “I couldn’t find anything 
wrong with you except hypoglyce- 
mia and dehydration, so I treated 
that.” She paused and eyed him 
with a curiosity equal to his own. 
“Just what do you think hap- 
pened?” she asked. 

“I think I was poisoned.” 

“That’s impossible ” 

“Possibly,” Albert conceded, “but 
it might be an idea to check that 
food I left all over the cell.” 

“That was cleaned up hours ago” 
“Convenient, isn’t it?” 

“I don’t know what you mean 
by that,” she said. “Someone in the 
kitchens might have made a mis- 
take. Yet you were the only case ” 
She looked thoughtful. “I think I 
will do a little checking in the Cen- 
tral Kitchen, just to be on the safe 
side.” She smiled a bright profes- 
sional smile. “Anyway, I’m glad to 
see that you have recovered so well. 
I’m sure you can go back tomor- 
row.” 

She vanished through the door 
with a rustle of white dacron. Al- 
bert, after listening a moment to 
make sure that she was gone, rose 
to his feet and began an inspection 
of his room. 

It wasn’t a jail cell. Not quite. 
But it wasn’t designed for easy 
escape, either. It was on the top 
floor of the IC building, a good 
hundred feet down to the street 
below. The window was covered 
with a steel grating and the door 
was locked. But both window and 



NSIDEK1CK 



119 




door were designed to hold a sick 
man rather than a healthy and des- 
perate one. 

Albert looked out of the window. 
The building was constructed to 
harmonize with native structures 
surrounding it, so the outer walls 
were studded with protuberances 
and bosses that would give ade- 
quate handholds to a man strong 
enough to brave the terrors of the 
descent. 

Looking down the wall, Albert 
wavered. Thinking back, he made 
up his mind. 

t' RED KEMMER was dis- 
turbed. By all the rules, Albert 
Johnson should be dead. But Shifaz 
had failed, and that fool guard had 
to call in the medics. It was going 
to be harder to get at Johnson, now 
that he was in the infirmary, but he 
had to be reached. 

One might buy off an agent who 
was merely checking on tax eva- 
sion, but tobacco was another mat- 
ter entirely. Kemmer wished he 
hadn’t agreed to boss Operation 
Weed. The glowing dreams of pro- 
motion and fortune were beginning 
to yellow around the edges. Visions 
of the Penal Colony bothered him, 
for if the operation went sour, he 
would do the paying. He had 
known that when he took the job, 
but the possibility seemed remote 
then. 

He shook his head. It wasn’t that 
bad yet. As long as Johnson hadn’t 



communicated with anyone else 
and as long as he was still in com- 
pany hands, something could be 
done. 

Kemmer thought a while, trying 
to put himself in Johnson’s place. 
Undoubtedly the spy was fright- 
ened, and undoubtedly he would 
try to escape. And since it would 
be far easier to escape from the in- 
firmary than it would be from de- 
tention, he would try as soon as 
possible. 

Kemmer’s face cleared. If John- 
son tried it, he would find it wasn’t 
as easy as he thought. 

With characteristic swiftness, 
Kemmer outlined his plans and 
made the necessary arrangements. 
A guard was posted in the hall with 
orders to shoot if Johnson tried the 
door of his room, and Kemmer him- 
self took a stand in the building 
across the street, facing the hospital, 
where he could watch the window 
of Albert’s room. As he figured it, 
the window was the best bet. He 
stroked the long-barreled blaster 
lying beside him. Johnson still 
hadn’t a chance, but these delays 
in disposing of him were becoming 
an annoyance. 

Cautiously, Albert tried the grat- 
ing that covered the window. The 
Antarean climate had rusted the 
heavy screws that fastened it to the 
casing. One of the bars was loose. 
If it could be removed, it would 
serve as a lever to pry out the 
entire grating.

Albert twisted at the bar. It 
groaned and squealed. He nerv- 
ously applied more pressure, and 
the bar moved slowly out of its 
fastenings. 

r pHE Zark observed his actions 
curiously. Now why was its host 
twisting that rod of metal out of the 
woodwork? It didn’t know, and it 
was consumed with curiosity. It had 
found no way to communicate with 
its host so that some of the man’s 
queer actions could be understood; 
in the portions of the brain it had 
explored, there were no portals of 
communication. However, there 
still was a large dormant portion, 
and perhaps here lay the thing it 
sought. The Zark inserted a num- 
ber of tendrils into the blank areas, 
probing, connecting synapses, open- 
ing unused pathways, looking for 
what it hoped existed. 

The results of this action were 
completely unforeseen by the Zark, 
for it was essentially just a sub- 
ordinate ego with all the lacks 
which that implied — and it had 
never before inhabited a body that 
possessed a potentially first-class 
brain. With no prior experience to 
draw upon, the Zark couldn’t pos- 
sibly guess that its actions would 
result in a peculiar relationship be- 
tween the man and the world 
around him. And if the Zark had 
known, it probably wouldn’t have 
cared. 

Albert removed the bar and pried 



out the grating. With only a mo- 
mentary hesitation, he lowered 
himself over the sill until his feet 
struck an ornamental knob on the 
wall. He glanced quickly down. 
There was another protuberance 
about two feet below the one on 
which he was standing. Pressing 
against the wall, he inched one foot 
downward until it found the foot- 
hold. With relief, he shifted his 
weight to the lower foot, and as he 
did a wave of heat enveloped his 
legs. The protuberance came loose 
from the wall with a grating noise 
mixed with the crackling hiss of a 
blaster bolt, and Albert plunged 
toward the street below. 

As the pavement rushed at him, 
he had time for a brief, fervent wish 
that he were someplace else. Then 
the thought was swallowed in an 
icy blackness. 

Tj 1 RED KEMMER lowered the 
blaster with a grin of satisfac- 
tion. He had figured his man cor- 
rectly, and now the spy would be 
nothing to worry about. He watched 
the plummeting body — and gasped 
with consternation, for less than ten 
feet above the pavement, Albert 
abruptly vanished! 

There is such a thing as too much 
surprise, too much shock, too much 
amazement. And that precisely was 
what affected Albert when he found 
himself standing on the street where 
the IC guards had picked him up. 
By rights, he should have been a 



122 



GALAXY 




pulpy smear against the pavement 
beneath the infirmary window. But 
he was not. He didn’t question why 
he was here, or consider how he 
had managed to avoid the certain 
death that waited for him. The fact 
was that he had done it, somehow. 
And that was enough. 

It was almost like history repeat- 
ing itself. Shifaz was at his usual 
stand haranguing another group of 
tourists. It was the same spiel as 
before, and almost at the same 
point of the pitch. But his actions 
upon seeing Albert were entirely 
different. His eyes widened, but 
this time he slid quietly from his 
perch on the cornerstone of the 
building and disappeared into the 
milling crowd. 

Albert followed. The fact that 
Shifaz was somewhere in that 
crowd was enough to start him mov- 
ing, and, once started, stubbornness 
kept him going, plowing irresistibly 
through the thick swarm of Vaor- 
nese. Reason told him that no 
Earthman could expect to find a 
native hidden among hundreds of 
his own kind. Their bipedal dino- 
saurlike figures seemed to be cast 
out of one mold. 

A chase through this crowd was 
futile, but he went on deeper into 
the Kazlak, drawn along an in- 
visible trail by some unearthly 
sense that told him he was right. 
He was as certain of it as that his 
name was Albert Johnson. And 
when he finally cornered Shifaz in a 



deserted alley, he was the one who 
was not surprised. 

Shifaz squawked and darted 
toward Albert, a knife glittering in 
his hand. Albert felt a stinging pain 
across the muscles of his left arm 
as he blocked the thrust aimed at 
his belly, wrenched the knife from 
the native’s grasp, and slammed 
him to the pavement. 

Shifaz bounced like a rubber 
ball, but he had no chance against 
the bigger and stronger Earthman. 
Albert knocked him down again. 
This time the native didn’t rjse. He 
lay in the street, a trickle of blood 
oozing from the corner of his lipless 
mouth, hate radiating from him in 
palpable waves. 

Albert stood over him, panting a 
little from the brief but violent 
scuffle. “Now, Shifaz, you’re going 
to tell me things,” he said heavily. 

“You can go to your Place of 
Punishment,” Shifaz snarled. “I 
shall say nothing.” 

“I can beat the answers out of 
you,” Albert mused aloud, “but I 
won’t. I’ll just ask you questions, 
and every time I don’t like your 
answer, I’ll kick one of your teeth 
out. If you don’t answer, I guaran- 
tee that you’ll look like an old 
grandmother.” 

CHIFAZ turned a paler green. 

To lose one’s teeth was a pun- 
ishment reserved only for females. 
He would be a thing of mockery 
and laughter — but there were 



INSIDEKICK 



123 




worse things than losing teeth or 
face. There was such a thing as 
losing one’s life, and he knew what 
would happen if he betrayed IC. 
Then he brightened. He could al- 
ways lie, and this hulking brute of 
an Earthman wouldn’t know — 
couldn’t possibly know. So he 
nodded with a touch of artistic 
reluctance. “All right,” he said, “111 
talk.” He injected a note of fear 
into his voice. It wasn’t hard to do. 

“Where did you get that tobac- 
co?” Albert asked. 

“From a farm,” Shifaz said. That 
was the truth. The Earthman prob- 
ably knew about tobacco and there 
was no need to lie, yet. 

“Where is it?” 

Shifaz thought quickly of the 
clearing in the forest south of 
Lagash where the green broad- 
leaved plants were grown, and 
said, “It’s just outside of Timargh, 
along the road which runs south.” 
He waited tensely for Albert’s re- 
action, wincing as the Earthman 
drew his foot back. Timargh was 
a good fifty miles from Lagash, 
and if this lie went over, he felt 
that he could proceed with confi- 
dence. 

It went over. Albert replaced 
his foot on the ground. “You tell- 
ing the truth?” 

“As Murgh is my witness,” Shi- 
faz said with sincerity. 

Albert nodded and Shifaz re- 
laxed with hidden relief. Apparent- 
ly the man knew that Murgh was 



the most sacred and respected 
deity in the pantheon of Antar, 
and that oaths based upon his 
name were inviolable. But what 
the scaleless oaf didn’t know was 
that this applied to Antarians only. 
As far as these strangers from an- 
other world were concerned, any- 
thing went. 

So Albert continued questioning, 
and Shifaz answered, sometimes 
readily, sometimes reluctantly, tell- 
ing the truth when it wasn’t harm- 
ful, lying when necessary. The na- 
tive’s brain was fertile and the 
tissue of lies and truth hung to- 
gether well, and Albert seemed 
satisfied. At any rate, he finally 
went away, leaving behind a softly 
whistling Vaornese who congratu- 
lated himself on the fact that he 
had once more imposed upon this 
outlander’s credulity. He was so 
easy to fool that it was almost a 
crime to do it. 

But he wouldn’t have been so 
pleased with himself if he could 
have seen the inside of Albert’s 
mind. For Albert knew the truth 
about the four-hundred-acre farm 
south of Lagash. He knew about 
the hidden curing sheds and proc- 
essing plant. He knew that both 
Vaornese and Lagashites were 
deeply involved in something they 
called Operation Weed, and ap- 
proved of it thoroughly either from 
sheer cussedness or addiction. He 
had quietly read the native’s mind 
while the half-truths and lies had 



124 



GALAXY 




fallen from his forked tongue. And, 
catching Shifaz’s last thought, Al- 
bert couldn’t help chuckling. 

At one of the larger intersec- 
tions, Albert stopped under a flam- 
ing cresset and looked at his arm. 
There was a wide red stain that 
looked black against the whiteness 
of his pajamas. That much blood 
meant more than a scratch, even 
though there was no pain — and 
cuts on this world could be deadly 
if they weren’t attended to prompt- 

ly- 

He suddenly felt alone and help- 
less, wishing desperately for a quiet 
place where he could dress his 
wound and be safe from the eyes 
he knew were inspecting him. He 
was too conspicuous. The pajamas 
were out of place on the street. Un- 
doubtedly natives were hurrying to 
report him to the IC. 

His mind turned to his room 
in the hostel with its well-fitted 
wardrobe and its first-aid kit — 
and again came that instant of ut- 
ter darkness — and then he was 
standing in the middle of his room 
facing the wardrobe that held his 
clothing. 

T¥E felt no surprise this time. 
*-■*- He knew what had happened. 
Something within his body was 
acting like a tiny Distorter, trans- 
porting him through hyperspace in 
the same manner that a starship’s 
engine room warped it through the 
folds of the normal space-time con- 



tinuum. There was nothing really 
strange about it It was a power 
which he should have — which any 
normal man should have. The fact 
that he didn’t have it before was 
of no consequence, and the fact 
that other men didn’t have it now 
merely made them abnormal. 

He smiled as he considered the 
possibilities which these new pow- 
ers gave him. They were enor- 
mous. At the very least they 
tripled his value as an agent. Noth- 
ing was safe from his investiga- 
tion. The most secret hiding places 
were open to his probings. Nothing 
could stop him, for command of 
hyperspace made a mockery of 
material barriers. 

He chuckled happily as he re- 
moved his pajama jacket and 
reached for the first-aid kit. From 
the gash in his sleeve, there should 
be a nasty cut underneath, and it 
startled him a little that there was 
no greater amount of hemorrhage. 
He cleaned off the dried blood — 
and found nothing underneath ex- 
cept a thin red bloodless line that 
ran halfway around his arm. It 
wasn’t even a scratch. 

Yet he had felt Shifaz’ blade 
slice into his flesh. He knew there 
was more damage than this. The 
blood and the slashed sleeve could 
tell him that, even if he didn’t 
have the messages of his nerves. 
Yet now there was no pain, and the 
closed scratch certainly wasn’t the 
major wound he had expected.

And this was queer, a fact for 
which he had no explanation. Al- 
bert frowned. Maybe this was an- 
other facet of the psi factors that 
had suddenly become his. 

He wondered where they had 
come from. Without warning, he 
had become able to read minds 
with accuracy and do ah effective 
job of teleportation. About the 
only things he lacked to be a well- 
rounded psi were telekinetic pow- 
ers and precognition. 

His frown froze on his face as 
he became conscious of a sense 
of unease. They were coming down 
the hall — two IC guardsmen. He 
caught the doubt and certainty in 
their minds — doubt that he would 
be in his room, certainty that he 
would be ultimately caught, for 
on Antar there was no place for an 
Earthman to hide. 

Albert slipped into the first suit 
that came to hand, blessing the 
seam tabs that made dressing a 
moment’s work. As the guards 
opened the door, he visualized the 
spot on the Lagash road where he 
had encountered the Bandersnatch. 
It was easier than before. He was 
standing in the middle of the road, 
the center of the surprised atten- 
tion of a few travelers, when the 
guards entered his room. 

HP HE bright light of Antar’s 
golden day came down from a 
cloudless yellow sky. In the forest 
strip ahead, Albert could hear a 



faint medley of coughs, grunts and 
snarls as the lesser beasts fed upon 
the remains of yesterday’s garbage. 
Albert moved down the road, 
ignoring the startled natives. This 
time he wasn’t afraid of meeting 
a Bandersnatch or anything else, 
for he had a method of escape that 
was foolproof. Lagash was some 
thirty miles ahead, but in the 
lighter gravity of Antar, the walk 
would be stimulating rather than 
exhausting. 

He went at a steady pace, oc- 
casionally turning his glance to the 
road, impressing sections of it upon 
his memory so that he could re- 
turn to them via teleport if neces- 
sary. He found that he could mem- 
orize with perfect ease. Even the 
positions of clumps of grass and 
twigs were remembered with per- 
fect clarity and in minute detail. 
The perfection of his memory as- 
tonished and delighted him. 

The Zark felt pleased with itself. 
Although it had never dreamed of 
the potential contained in the 
host’s mind, it realized that it was 
responsible for the release of these 
weird powers, and it enjoyed the 
new sensations and was eager for 
more. If partial probing could 
achieve so much, what was the ul- 
timate power of this remarkable 
mind? The Zark didn’t know, but, 
like a true experimenter, it was 
determined to find out — so it 
probed deeper, opening still more 
pathways and connecting more 



126 



GALAXY 




synapses with the conscious brain. 

It was routine work that could 
be performed automatically while 
the rest of the Zark enjoyed the 
colorful beauty of the Antarian 
scenery. 

With the forest quickly left be- 
hind him, Albert walked through 
gently rolling grassland dotted 
with small farms and homesteads. 
It was a peaceful scene, similar 
to many he had seen on Earth, 
and the familiarity brought a sense 
of nostalgic longing to be home 
again. But the feeling was not too 
strong, more intellectual than 
physical, for the memories of 
Earth were oddly blurred. 

Time passed and the road un- 
reeled behind him. Once he took 
to the underbrush to let a hum- 
ming IC ground car pass, and twice 
more he hid as airboats swept by 
overhead, but the annoyances were 
minor and unimportant 

When hiding from the second 
airboat, he disturbed a kelit in 
the thick brush growing beside 
the road. The little insect-eater 
chittered in alarm and dashed off 
to safety across the highway. And 
Albert, looking at it, was conscious 
not only of the external shape 
but the internal as well! 

He could see its little heart 
pounding in its chest, and the 
pumping bellows of the pink lungs 
that surrounded it. He was aware 
of the muscles pulling and relax- 
ing as the kelit ran, and the long 



bones sliding in their lubricated 
joints. He saw the tenseness of 
the abdominal organs, felt the 
blind fear in the creature’s mind. 
The totality of his impressions 
washed through him with a clear 
wave of icy shock. 

G RIMLY, he shrugged it off. He 
had ESP. He ought to have ex- 
pected it — it was the next logical 
step. He scrambled back to the 
road and walked onward a little 
faster, until the battlements of 
Lagash came in sight 

The Lagash Arm was farther 
from the city than was that of 
Vaomia, and as he came to the 
strip of jungle, he turned his eyes 
upon the empty parklike arcades 
between the trees. The last edible 
garbage had long since been con- 
sumed and the greater and lesser 
beasts had departed for the cooler 
depths of the forest, but Albert 
was conscious of life. It was all 
around him, in the trees with the 
ringed layers of their trunks and 
the sap flowing slowly upward 
through the cambium layer be- 
neath their scaly bark, in the in- 
sects feeding upon the nectar of 
the aerial vine blossoms, in the 
rapid photosynthetic reactions of 
the leaves. 

His gaze, turning aloft, was con- 
scious of the birds and the tiny 
arboreal mammals. He saw the 
whole forest with eyes filled with 
wonder at its life and beauty. It 



INSIDEKICK 



127 




was the only right way to see. 

At the proper distance from 
Lagash, he plunged off boldly 
across country and entered the 
main area of the forest, reflecting 
wryly as he did so that he was 
probably the first human in the 
short history of Antarian explora- 
tion who had gone into one of the 
great forests with absolute knowl- 
edge that he would come out of it 
alive. And, as so often happens 
to men who have no fear, trouble 
avoided him. 

He followed the directions he 
had obtained from Shifaz and 
found the plantation without 
trouble. He could hardly miss it, 
because its size was far from ac- 
curately expressed in the native’s 
memory. Skillfully concealed be- 
neath an overhanging network of 
aerial vines whose camouflage 
made it invisible from the air, con- 
cealing the tobacco plants from 
casual detector search, the planta- 
tion extended in row upon narrow 
row, the irregular strips of fields 
separated by rows of trees from 
which the camouflage was hung. 
A fragile electric fence encircled 
the area, a seemingly weak de- 
fense, but one through which even 
the greatest Antarian beast would 
not attempt to pass. 

Albert whistled softly under his 
breath at what he saw, recorded 
it in his memory. Then, having 
finished the eyewitness part of his 
task, he recalled a section of road 



over which he had passed, and 
pushed. 

The return journey to Vaomia 
was experimental in nature, as Al- 
bert tried the range of his powers. 
His best was just short of twenty 
miles and the journey which had 
taken him eight hours was made 
back in somewhat less than twen- 
ty minutes, counting half a dozen 
delays and backtracks. 

T^HERE was no question about 
■*- where Albert would go next. 
He had to get evidence, and that 
evidence lay in only one place — 
in the local office of the Inter- 
world Corporation in Vaomia. 

A moment later, he stood in 
the reception room looking across 
the empty desks at the bright 
square of light shining through the 
glassite paneled door of Fred 
Kemmer’s office. It was past clos- 
ing hours, but Kemmer had a right 
to be working late. Right now, he 
was probably sweating blood at 
the thought of what would happen 
if Albert had finally managed to 
escape him. The Corporation 
would virtuously disown him and 
leave him to face a ten-year rap 
in Penal Colony. Albert almost 
felt sorry for him. 

Albert let his perception sense 
travel through the wall and into 
Kemmer’s room. His guess was 
right— the local boss was sweating. 

He checked Kemmer’s office 
swiftly, but the only thing that 



128 



GALAXY 




interested him was the big vault 
beside the desk. He visualized the 
interior of the vault and pushed 
himself inside. Separated from 
Kemmer by six inches of the hard- 
est metal known to Man, he quiet- 
ly leafed through the files of con- 
fidential correspondence until he 
found what he wanted. He didn’t 
need a light. His perception 
worked as well in the dark as in 
the daylight 

There was enough documentary 
evidence in the big vault to indict 
quite a few more IC officials than 
Kemmer — and perhaps investi- 
gation of their files would provide 
more leads to even higher offi- 
cials. Wherever Kemmer was go- 
ing, Albert had the idea that he 
wouldn’t be going alone. 

Albert selected all the incrimi- 
nating letters and documents he 
could find and packed the micro- 
files in his jacket Finally, bulg- 
ing with documentary informa- 
tion, he pushed back into the 
streets. 

It was late enough for few 
natives to be on the streets, and 
his appearance caused no com- 
ment Apparently unnoticed, he 
moved rapidly into the Kazlak, 
searching for a place to hide the 
papers he had stolen. What he had 
learned of Vaomia made him cau- 
tious. He checked constantly for 
spies, but there wasn’t a native 
in sensing range. 

He ducked into the alleyway 



where he had caught Shifaz. His 
memory of it had been right. There 
was a small hole in one of the 
building walls, partly covered with 
cracked plaster, and barely visible 
in the darkness. The gloom of the 
Kazlak scarcely varied with night 
or day, as the enormous labyrinth 
of covered passages and building 
walls was pierced with only a few 
ventilation holes. Cressets at the 
main intersections burned con- 
stantly, their smokeless flames 
lighting the streets poorly. 

He wondered idly how he had 
managed to remember the way to 
this place, let alone the little hole 
in the wall, as he stuffed the 
micro-files into its dark interior. 
He finished, turned to leave, and 
was out on the main tunnel before 
he became aware of the IC ground 
cars closing in upon him. 

The Corporation was really on 
the beam, their spies everywhere. 
But they didn’t know his abilities. 
He visualized and pushed. They 
were going to be surprised when 
he vanished — but he didn’t vanish. 

The expression of shocked sur- 
prise was still on his face as the 
stat gun blast took him squarely 
in the chest 

T¥E was tied to a chair in Fred 
Kemmer’s office. He recog- 
nized it easily, although physical- 
ly he had never been inside the 
room. His head hurt as a polygraph 
recorder was strapped to his left 



INSIDEKICK

arm, and behind him, beyond his 
range of vision, he could sense an- 
other man and several machines. 
In front of him stood Fred Kem- 
mer with an expression of satis- 
faction on his face. 

“Don’t start thinking you’re 
smart,” Kemmer said. “You’re in 
no position for it.” 

“You’ve tried to kill me three 
times,” Albert reminded him. 
“There’s always a fourth time.” 
“I don’t think so. Too many 
people know.” 

“Precisely my own conclusion,” 
Kemmer said, “but there are other 
ways. Brainwashing’s a good one.” 
“That’s illegal!” Albert pro- 
tested. “Besides—” 

“So what?” Kemmer cut him 
off. “It’s an illegal universe.” 
Albert probed urgently at the 
IC man’s mind, hoping to find 
something he could turn to his ad- 
vantage, but all he found were 
surface thoughts — satisfaction at 
having gotten the spy where 
he could do no harm, plans for 
turning Albert into a mindless 
idiot, thoughts of extracting infor- 
mation — all of which had an air of 
certainty that was unnerving. Al- 
bert had badly underestimated 
him. It was high time to leave here, 
if he could. 

Albert visualized an area out- 
side Vaornia, and, as he tried to 
push, a machine hummed loudly 
behind him. He didn’t move. Mis- 
take, Albert thought worriedly, 



Fm not going anywhere — and 
he knows I’m scared 

“It won’t do you any good,” 
Kemmer said. “It didn’t take too 
much brains to figure you were 
using hyperspace in those disap- 
pearing acts. There’s an insulating 
field around that' chair thafd stop 
a space yacht.” He leaned forward. 
“Now — what are your contacts, 
and who gave you the information 
on where to look?” 

Albert saw no reason to hide 
it, but there was no sense in re- 
vealing anything. The Patrol had 
word of his arrest by now and 
should be here any moment 
It was as though Kemmer had 
read his mind. “Don’t count on 
being rescued. I stopped the Patrol 
report.” Kemmer paused, obvious- 
ly enjoying the expression on Al- 
bert’s face. “You know,” he went 
on, “there’s a peculiar fact about 
nerves that maybe you don’t know. 
A stimulus sets up a brief neural 
volley lasting about a hundredth 
of a second. Following that comes 
a period of refractivity lasting per- 
haps a tenth of that time while the 
nerve repolarizes, and then, im- 
mediately after repolarization, 
there is an extremely short period 
of hypersensitivity.” 

“What’s that to do with me?” 
Albert asked. 

“You’ll find out if you don’t 
answer promptly and truthfully. 
That gadget on your arm is con- 
nected to a polygraph. Now do 



130 



GALAXY 




you want to make a statement?” 

Albert shook his head. He was 
conscious of a brief pain in one 
finger, and the next instant some- 
one tore the finger out of his hand 
with red hot pincers. He screamed. 
He couldn’t help it. This punish- 
ment was beyond agony. 

“Nice, isn’t it?” Kemmer asked 
as Albert looked down at his am- 
putated finger that still was re- 
markably attached to his hand. 
“And the beauty of it is that it 
doesn’t even leave a mark. Of 
course, if it’s repeated enough, it 
will end up as a permanent paraly- 
sis of the part stimulated. Now 
once again — who gave you that 
information?” 

A LBERT talked. It was futile 
to try to deceive a polygraph 
and he wanted no more of that 
nerve treatment — and then he 
looked into Kemmer’s mind again 
and discovered what went into 
brainwashing. The shock was like 
ice water. Hypersensitive stimu- 
lation, Kemmer was thinking glee- 
fully, would reduce this fat slob 
in the chair to a screaming mind- 
less lump that could be molded 
like wet putty. 

Albert felt helpless. He couldn’t 
run and he couldn’t fight. But he 
wasn’t ready to give up. His per- 
ception passed over and through 
Kemmer with microscopic care, 
looking for some weakness, some- 
thing that could be exploited to 



advantage. Kemmer had to have 
a vulnerable point. 

He did. 

There was a spot on the inner 
lining of the radial vein in Kem- 
mer’s left arm. He had recently 
received an inoculation, one of the 
constant immunizing injections 
that were necessary on Antar, for 
there was a small thrombus cling- 
ing to the needle puncture on the 
inner wall of the vessel. Normally 
it was unimportant and would 
pass away in time and be absorbed, 
but there were considerable pos- 
sibilities for trouble in that little 
blob of red cells and fibrin if they 
could be loosened from their at- 
tachment to the wall. 

Hopefully, Albert reached out. 
If he couldn’t move himself, per- 
haps he could move the clot. 

The thrombus stirred and came 
free, rushing toward Kemmer’s 
heart. Albert followed it, watch- 
ing as it passed into the pulmonary 
artery, tracing it out through the 
smaller vessels until it stopped 
squarely across a junction of two 
arterioles. 

Kemmer coughed, his face 
whitening with pain as he clutched 
at his chest. The pain was a mild 
repayment for his recent agony, 
Albert thought grimly. A pul- 
monary embolism shouldn’t kill 
him, but the effects were dispro- 
portionate to the cause and would 
last a while. He grinned merci- 
lessly as Kemmer collapsed.

A man darted from behind the 
chair and bent over Kemmer. 
Fumbling in his haste, he produced 
a pocket communicator, stabbed 
frantically at the dial and spoke 
urgently into it “Medic! Boss’s 
office — hurry!” 

For a second, Albert didn’t 
realize that the hum of machinery 
behind him had stopped, but when 
he did, both Albert and the chair 
vanished. 

The Zark realized that its host 
had been hurt again. It was in- 
furiating to be so helpless. Things 
kept happening to Albert which it 
couldn’t correct until too late. 
There were forces involved that it 
didn’t know how to handle; they 
were entirely outside the Zark’s 
experience. It only felt relief when 
Albert managed to regain his abili- 
ty to move — and, as it looked out 
upon the familiar green Antarian 
countryside, it felt almost happy. 
Of course Albert was probably 
still in trouble, but it wasn’t so 
bad now. At least the man was 
away from the cause of his pain. 

I T was a hell of a note, Albert 
reflected, sitting beside the 
road that led to Lagash and work- 
ing upon the bonds that tied him 
to the chair. He had managed to 
get out of Kemmer’s hands, but it 
appeared probable that he would 
get no farther. As things stood, he 
couldn’t transmit the information 
he had gained — and by this time

probably every IC office on the 
planet was alerted to the fact that 
Earth Central had a psi-type agent 
on Antar — one who whs not in- 
herently unstable, like those poor 
devils in the par a psychological 
laboratories on Earth. They would 
be ready for him with everything 
from Distorter screens to Kellys. 

He didn’t underestimate IC now. 
Whatever its morals might be, its 
personnel was neither stupid nor 
slow to act. He was trapped in 
this sector of the planet. Prime 
Base was over a thousand miles 
away, and even if he did manage 
to make his way back to it along 
the trade routes, it was a virtual 
certainly that he would never be 
able to get near a class I commu- 
nicator or the Patrol office. IC 
would have ample time to get 
ready for him, and no matter what 
powers he possessed, a single man 
would have no chance against the 
massed technology of the corpo- 
ration. 

However, he could play tag with 
IC in this area for some time with 
the reasonable possibility that he 
wouldn’t get caught If nothing 
else, it would have nuisance value. 
He pulled one hand free of the 
tape that held it to the chair arm 
and swiftly removed the rest of 
the tape that bound him. He had 
his freedom again. Now what 
would he do with it? 

He left the chair behind and 
started down the road toward La- 



gash. There was no good reason to 
head in that particular direction, 
but at the moment one direction 
was as good as another until he 
could plan a course of action. His 
brain felt oddly fuzzy. He didn’t 
realize that he had reached the 
end of his strength until he dropped 
in the roadway. 

To compensate for the miser- 
able job it had done in protecting 
him from poison and neural tor- 
ture,. the Zark had successfully 
managed to block hunger and 
fatigue pains until Albert’s over- 
taxed body could stand no more. 
It realized its error after Albert 
collapsed. Sensibly, it did nothing. 
Its host had burned a tremendous 
amount of energy without replen- 
ishment, and he needed time to 
rest and draw upon less available 
reserves, and to detoxify and elimi- 
nate the metabolic poisons in his 
body. 

It was late that afternoon before 
Albert recovered enough to take 
more than a passing interest in his 
surroundings. He had a vague 
memory of hiring a dak cart driver 
to take him down the road. The 
memory was apparently correct, 
because he was lying in the back 
of a cargo cart piled high with 
short pieces of cane. The cart was 
moving at a brisk pace despite the 
apparently leisurely movements of 
the dak between the shafts. The 
ponderous ten-foot strides ate up 
distance. 



134 



GALAXY 




He was conscious of a hunger 
that was beyond discomfort, and a 
thirst that left his mouth dry and 
cottony. It was as though he hadn’t 
eaten or drunk for days. He felt 
utterly spent, drained beyond ex- 
haustion. He was in no shape to 
do anything, and unless he man- 
aged to find food and drink pretty 
soon, he would be easy pickings 
for IC. 

TTE looked around the cart, but 
-1-®- there was nothing except the 
canes on which he lay. There 
wasn’t even any of the foul por- 
ridgelike mess that the natives 
called food, since native workers 
didn’t bother about eating during 
working hours. 

He turned over slowly, feeling 
the hard canes grind into his body 
as he moved. He kept thinking 
about food — about meals aboard 
ship, about dinners, about Earth 
restaurants, about steak, potatoes, 
bread— solid heartening foods filled 
with proteins, fats and carbohy- 
drates. 

Carbohydrates — the thought 
stuck in his mind for some reason. 
And then he realized why. 

The canes he was lying on in 
in the cart were sugar cane! He 
had never seen them on Earth, 
but he should have expected to 
find them out here— one of Earth’s 
greatest exports was the seeds 
from which beet and cane sugar 
were obtained. 



He pulled a length of cane from 
the pile and bit into one end. His 
depleted body reached eagerly for 
the sweet energy that filled his 
mouth. 

With the restoration of his 
energy balance came clearer and 
more logical thought. It might be 
well enough to make IC spend 
valuable time looking for him, but 
such delaying actions had no posi- 
tive value. Ultimately he would 
be caught, and his usefulness would 
disappear with his death. But if he 
could get word to the Patrol, this 
whole business could be smashed. 

Now if he made a big enough 
disturbance — it might possibly 
even reach the noses of the Patrol. 
Perhaps by working through the 
hundred or so tourists in Vaornia 
and Lagash, he could — 

That was it, the only possible 
solution. The IC might be able 
to get rid of one man, but it 
couldn’t possibly get rid of a hun- 
dred — and somewhere in that 
group of tourists there would be 
one who’d talk, someone who 
would pass the word. IC couldn’t 
keep this quiet without brainwash- 
ing the lot of them, and that in 
itself would be enough to bring 
a Patrol ship here at maximum 
blast. 

He chuckled happily. The na- 
tive driver, startled at the strange 
sound, turned his head just in 
time to see his passenger vanish, 
together with a bundle of cane.

The native shook his head in an 
oddly human gesture. These for- 
eigners were strange creatures in- 
deed. 

A LBERT, thin, pale, but happy, 
sat at a table in one of the 
smaller cafeterias in Earth Center, 
talking to the Chief over a second 
helping of dessert. The fearful 
energy drain of esper activity, 
combined with the constant dodg- 
ing to avoid IC hunting parties, 
had made him a gaunt shadow — 
but he had managed to survive 
until a Patrol ship arrived to in- 
vestigate the strange stories told 
by tourists, of a man who haunted 
the towns of Lagash and Vaornia, 
and the road between. 

“That’s all there was to it, sir,” 
Albert concluded. “Once I figured 
it out that not even IC could get 
away with mass murder, it was 
easy. I just kept popping up in 
odd places and telling my story, 
and then, to make it impressive, 
I’d disappear. I had nearly two 
days before IC caught on, and by 
then you knew. The only trouble 
was getting enough to eat. I damn 
near starved before the Patrol ar- 
rived. I expect that we owe quite 
a few farmers and shopkeepers 
reparations for the food I stole.” 

“They’ll be paid, providing they 
present a claim,” the Chief said. 
“But there’s one thing about all 
this that bothers me. I know you 
had no psi powers when you left 



Earth on this mission, just where 
did you acquire them?” 

Albert shook his head. “I don’t 
know,” he said. “Unless they were 
latent and developed in Antar’s 
peculiar climatic and physical con- 
ditions. Or maybe it was the shock 
of that meeting with the Bander- 
snatch. All I’m sure of is that I 
didn’t have any until after that 
meeting with Shifaz.” 

“Well, you certainly have them 
now. The Parapsych boys are hot 
on your tail, but we’ve stalled them 
off.” 

“Thanks. I don’t want to imi- 
tate a guinea pig.” 

“We owe you' at least that for 
getting us a case against IC. Even 
their shysters won’t be able to 
wiggle out of this one.” The Chief 
smiled. “It’s nice to have those lads 
where they can be handled for a 
change.” 

“They do need a dose of applied 
conscience,” Albert agreed. 

“The government also owes you 
a bonus and a vote of thanks.” 
“I’ll appreciate the bonus,” Al- 
bert said as he signaled for the 
waitress. “Recently, I can’t afford 
my appetite.” 

“It’s understandable. After all, 
you’ve lost nearly eighty pounds.” 
“Wonder if I’ll ever get them 
back,” Albert muttered as he bit 
into the third dessert. 

The Chief watched enviously. 
“I wouldn’t worry about that,” he 
said. “Just get your strength back.

There’s another assignment for 
you, one that will need your pecul- 
iar talents.” He stood up. “I’ll be 
seeing you. My ulcer can’t take 
your appetite any more.” He 
walked away. 

Inside Albert, the Zark alerted. 
A new assignment! That meant an- 
other world and new sensations. 
Truly, this host was magnificent! 
It had been a lucky day when he 
had fallen in running from the 
Bandersnatch. The Zark quivered 
with delight- 

And Albert felt it. 

Turning his perception inward 
to see what might be wrong, he 
saw the Zark for the first time. 

T? OR a second, a wave of repul- 
sion swept through his body, 
but as he comprehended the ex- 
tent of that protoplasmic mass so 
inextricably intertwined with his 
own, he realized that this thing 
within him was the reason for his 
new powers. There could be no 
other explanation. 

And as he searched farther, he 
marveled. The Zark was unspe- 
cialized in a way he had never 
imagined — an amorphous aggre- 
gation of highly evolved cells that 
could imitate normal tissues in a 
manner that would defy ordinary 
detection. It was something at 
once higher yet lower than his own 
flesh, something more primitive 
yet infinitely more evolved. 

The Zark had succeeded at last. 



It had established communication 
with its host 

“Answer me, parasite,” Albert 
muttered subvocally. “I know 
you’re there — and I know you can 
answer!” 

The Zark gave the protean 
equivalent of a shrug. If Albert 
only knew how it had tried to 
communicate — no, there was no 
communication between them. 
Their methods of thought were so 
different that there was no pos- 
sible rapport. 

It twitched— and Albert jumped. 
And for the first time in its long 
life, the Zark had an original idea. 
It moved a few milligrams of its 
substance to Albert’s throat region, 
and after a premonitory glottal 
spasm, Albert said very distinctly 
and quite involuntarily, “All right. 
I am here.” 

Albert froze with surprise, but 
when the shock passed, he laughed. 
“Well, I asked for it,” he said. 
“But it’s like the story about the 
man who talked to himself — and 
got answers. Not exactly a comfort- 
ing sensation.” 

“I’m sorry,” the Zark apologized. 
“I do not wish to cause discom- 
fort.” 

“You pick a poor way to keep 

from doing it.” 

“It was the only way I could 
figure to make contact with your 
conscious mind — and you desired 
that I communicate.” 

“I suppose you’re right. But

while it is nice to know that I 
really have a guardian angel, I’d 
have felt better about it if you 
had white robes and wings and 
were hovering over my shoulder.’* 

“I don’t understand,” the Zark 
said. 

“I was trying to be funny. You 
know,” Albert continued after a 
moment, “I never thought of trying 
to perceive myself. I wonder why. 
I guess because none of the medi- 
cal examinations showed anything 
different from normal.” 

“I was always afraid that you 
might suspect before I could tell 
you,” the Zark replied. “It was an 
obvious line of reasoning, and you 
are an intelligent entity — the most 
intelligent I have ever inhabited. 
It is too bad that I shall have to 
leave. I have enjoyed being with 
you.” 

“Who said anything about leav- 
ing?” Albert asked. 

“You did. I could feel your re- 
vulsion when you became aware 
of me. It wasn’t nice, but I sup- 
pose you can’t help it. Yours is an 
independent race, one that doesn’t 
willingly support—’* the voice hesi- 
tated as though searching for the 
proper word — “fellow travelers,” 
it finished. 

Albert grinned. “There are his- 
torical precedents for that state- 
ment, but your interpretation isn’t 
quite right. I was surprised. You 
startled me.” 

He fell silent, and the Zark, 



respecting the activity of his mind, 
forbore to interrupt. 

A LBERT was doing some heavy 
thinking about the Zark. Cer- 
tainly it had protected him on An- 
tar, and with equal certainty it 
must have been responsible for the 
psi owners he possessed. He owed 
it a lot, for without its help he 
wouldn’t have survived. 

There was only one thing wrong. 
Sexless though it was, the Zark 
must possess the characteristics of 
life, since it was obviously alive. 
And those characteristics were un- 
changing throughout the known 
universe. The four vital criteria 
defined centuries ago were still as 
good today as they were then — 
growth, metabolism, irritability — 
and reproduction. Despite its lack 
of sex, the Zark must be capable of 
producing others of its kind, and 
while he didn’t mind supporting 
one fellow traveler, he was damned 
if he’d support a whole family of 
them. > 

“That need never pother you,” 
the Zark interrupted. “As an indi- 
vidual, I am very long-lived and 
seldom reproduce. I can, of course, 
but the process is quite involved — 
actually it involves making a twin 
out of myself — and it is not neces- 
sary. Besides, there cannot be two 
Zarks in one host. My offspring 
would have to seek another.” 
“And do they have your 
powers?” 



138 



GALAXY 




“Of course. They would know 
all I know, for a Zark’s memory 
is not concentrated in specialized 
tissue like your brain 

A light began to dawn in Al- 
bert’s mind. Maybe this was the 
answer to the corporate conscience 
he had been wishing for so wist- 
fully on Antar. “Does it bother you 
to reproduce?” he asked. 

“It is annoying, but not pain- 
ful — nor would it be too difficult 
after a pattern was set in my cells. 
But why do you ask this?” 

“The thought just occurred to 
me that there are quite a few peo- 
ple who could use a Zark. A few 
of the more honest folks would 
improve this Confederation’s moral 
tone if they had the power — and 
certainly psi powers in law enforce- 
ment would be unbeatable.” 

“Then you would want me to 
reproduce?” 

“It might be a good idea if we 



can find men who are worthy of 
Zarks. I could check them with my 
telepathy and perhaps we might—” 
“Let me warn you,” the Zark 
interjected. “While this all sounds 
very fine, there are difficulties, even 
with a host as large as yourself. I 
shall need more energy than your 
body has available in order to 
duplicate myself. It will be hard 
for you to do what must be done.” 
“And what is that?” 

“Eat,” the Zark said, “great 
quantities of high energy foods.” 
It shuddered at the thought of Al- 
bert overloading his digestive tract 
any more than he had been doing 
the past week. 

But Albert’s reaction went to 
prove that while their relationship 
was physically close, mentally they 
were still far apart. Albert, the 
Zark noted in astonishment, didn’t 
regard it as an ordeal at all.

FANTASIA MATHEMATICA, 
edited by Cliiton Fadiman. Simon 
& Schuster, N,Y. t $4.95 

A nthologies, though com- 
posed of the creations of 
others, are creatures of the editor. 
Gestalted in the usual way, the 
whole is greater than its parts. And 
this whole book, assembled by 
Clifton Fadiman, has some impres- 
sive list of parts: Aldous Huxley, 
Branch Cabell, Wells, Koestler, 
Plato, Heinlein, Clarke, Ley, Lewis 
Carroll, and many equally distin- 
guished others. 

Fadiman apologizes for the 



abundant use of the Moebius Strip 
as plot motivator, but he needn’t. 
There must still be plenty of fun 
and paradox yet to be found in 
that simple bit of complexity. Wit- 
ness Cyril Kombluth’s delightful 
limerick about a burlycue queen 
who does a Moebius Strip. 

The overall quality of the stories 
is so high that the reviewer is hard 
pressed to select the special few 
worthy of separate mention. So, 
with back to wall, I submit “Jur-

THE JOY WAGON by Arthur T. 
Hadley. The Viking Press, N.Y., 
S3.50 

¥TOW many men have been re- 
viled as candidates of a ma- 
chine? So many that even Had- 
ley's true machine candidate rings 
too close to the truth for comfort. 

“Mike” Microvac, an endearing 
3000-tube electronic calculator 
with a war record of Pentagon 
service, is calculating enough to 
foresee incalculable benefit for 
itself and its species if elected to 
the Presidency. It cleverly hood- 
winks “Big Mac” McGowan, a 
political boss, into proposing can- 
didacy and supervising “Mike’s” 
campaign. 

John G. Schneider's Golden 
Kazoo was an account of an elec- 
tion run on a strict advertising 
basis by the Madison Ave. boys. 
However, they appear as amateurs 
against this Big Sell. 

What other candidate ever pos- 
sessed two right hands? (Mc- 
Gowan had to draw the line at 
more. Wholesale handshaking 
would look weird, proving that in 
certain ways Mike was naive.) 
What other candidate could talk 
out of both sides of his mouth 
simultaneously and still make 
sense? What other candidate had 
electronic circuits built into his 



appendages to soothe squalling in- 
fants? Additionally, Mike under- 
stands the value of human frailty. 
He bowls for relaxation and can 
be beaten. At slack moments of 
the day, he relaxes at the piano. 
The leading screen femme fatale 
refers to him as “that sexy box of 
wires.” 

All in all, Microvac the can- 
didate is at least as interesting and 
possibly more human than some 
we’ve seen in recent years. We’re 
beholden to Hadley for a rib-tick- 
ling yet spine-chilling book. 

DEADLY IMAGE by Edmund 
Cooper. Ballantine Books, N.Y., 
$2.00 

J ACK Williamson once conjured 
up a paradise in which Man, 
served by robots, was freed at last 
of drudgery and economic insecur- 
ity. He showed, to the best of his 
ability, that such a heaven is but 
a step from hell. Cooper has raised 
the entire theme one level, popu- 
lating his world with androids and 
humans. This change alone has al- 
tered the impact completely. 

For some psychological reason, 
it is easy to imagine a robot world 
dedicated to service, however re- 
strictive, to mankind. But androids, 
particularly articulate and adapt- 
able ones, somehow strike the 
reader as a race apart, one that 
can conceivably compete with 
Man on a survival basis.

Cooper has seen the future in 
just that light. His oddly and aptly 
named atomic war, the “Nine Days 
Tranquilizer ” has depopulated 
England to the extent that science 
perforce has had to develop arti- 
ficial workers. From unskilled 
laborer to competent craftsman is 
merely a problem in time and evo- 
lution. Eventually, the androids 
become the backbone of society, 
administrating as well as serving. 
Work and constructive activity are 
forbidden to humans. 

John Markham, government re- 
frigeration supervisor, is the un- 
willing and unhappy Survivor of 
the atomic age, deep-frozen at the

INVISIBLE BARRIERS by Da- 
vid Osborne. Avalon Books, N.Y., 
$2.75 

G eorge Orwell’s world of 
1984 was divided by mutual 
consent into three nations, so that 
a never-ending war of attrition 



would consume surplus capital 
goods. Osborne doesn’t have as 
good an excuse for chopping his 
world into four parts. He postu- 
lates a super-isolationism, Ameri- 
ca First carried to the Nth, that 
turtlenecks the four major spheres 
into ignoring the existence of their 
neighbors. Presumably, this is a 
solution to the threat of atomic 
warfare. But what if someone 
peeks through the curtains? 

Within his flimsy framework, 
Osborne has built a soundly 
plotted and written invasion yarn. 
His apportioned world lends itself 
without conflict to the classic Ro- 
man “Divide and Conquer.” With 
less than a year to unite Earth 
against the coming invasion and 
against super-McCarthyism that 
brands subversive the mere men- 
tion of foreign nations, the prob- 
lem is re-education of the public 
mind to internationalism. As agent 
of unity, Osborne has a reluctant 
big-time TV director who is a set- 
up, like you and me, for a big- 
time non-telegraphed shocker at 
the end.

FRONTIERS OF SCIENCE by 
Lynn Poole. Whittlesey House, 
N.Y., $3.25 

Th ETERMINING a profession 
is the most difficult decision 
for a youngster to make, once he 
passes idolatry of firemen and 
garbage collectors. Lynn Poole, 
producer of TV’s excellent and 
award-winning Johns Hopkins Re- 
view, offers a slew of choices on 
the perimeters of scientific knowl- 
edge that capture the imagination 
as these childhood heroes never 
did. 

Poole quotes a German scientist 
who, in 1895, after viewing an 
X-ray photo by Roentgen, said, 
“Today we have reached the peak 
of scientific discovery. There is 
little still yet to be found.” Even 
today, standing as we are on so 
many thresholds, one hears much 
the same guff. 

At the other extreme, Poole 
draws so many eye-opening pic- 
tures of the problems to be solved 
in chemurgy, atomics, cybernetics, 
etc., that he just might cause an 
imaginative youngster to wish 
wildly for a good, old-fashioned da 
Vinci-type universal mind.

By NED LANG 



Of all the Irksome, frustrating, 
maddening discoveries — was there 
no way of keeping it discovered? 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS

GALAXY 




Then he knew. But by then it 
was too late. 

Charles Dennison had been left 
a more than adequate income by 
his father. He had gone to Har- 
vard, served a hitch in the Navy, 
then continued his education at 
M.I.T. Since the age of thirty- 
two, he had been engaged in 
private research, working in his 
own small laboratory in River- 
dale, New York. Plant biology was 
his field. He published several 
noteworthy papers, and sold a new 
insecticide to a development cor- 
poration. The royalties helped him 
to expand his facilities. 

Dennison enjoyed working 
alone. It suited his temperament, 
which was austere but not un- 
friendly. Two or three times a 
year, he would come to New York, 
see some plays and movies, and 
do a little serious drinking. He 
would then return gratefully to his 
seclusion. He was a bachelor and 
seemed destined to remain that 
way. 

Not long after his fortieth birth- 
day, Dennison stumbled across an 
intriguing clue which led him into 
a different branch of biology. He 
pursued his clue, developed it, 
extended it slowly into a hypo th- 
esis. After three more years, a 
lucky accident put the final proofs 
into his hands. 

He had invented a most effec- 
tive longevity drug. It was not 
proof against violence; aside from 



that, however, it could fairly be 
called an immortality serum. 

"JVTOW was the time for caution. 
-L ’ But years of seclusion had 
made Dennison unwary of people 
and their motives. He was more or 
less heedless of the world around 
him; it never occurted to him that 
the world was not equally heedless 
of him. 

He thought only about his 
serum. It was valuable and patent- 
able. But was it the sort of thing 
that should be revealed? Was the 
world ready for an immortality 
drug? 

He had never enjoyed specula- 
tion of this sort. But since the 
atom bomb, many scientists had 
been forced to look at the ethics 
of their profession, Dennison 
looked at his and decided that 
immortality was inevitable. 

Mankind had, throughout its 
existence, poked and probed into 
the recesses of nature, trying to 
figure out how things worked. If 
one man didn’t discover fire, or 
the use of the lever, or gunpowder, 
or the atom bomb, or immortality, 
another would. Man willed to 
know all nature’s secrets, and there 
was no way of keeping them 
hidden. 

Armed with this bleak but 
comforting philosophy, Dennison 
packed his formulas and proofs 
into a briefcase, slipped a two- 
ounce bottle of the product into a 



FOREVER

jacket pocket, and left his River- 
dale laboratory. It was already 
evening. He planned to spend the 
night in a good midtown hotel, 
see a movie, and proceed to the 
Patent Office in Washington the 
following day. 

On the subway, Dennison was 
absorbed in a newspaper. He was 
barely conscious of the men sitting 
on either side of him. He became 
aware of them only when the man 
on his right poked him firmly in 
the ribs. 

Dennison glanced over and saw 
the snub nose of a small auto- 
matic, concealed from the rest of 
the car by a newspaper, resting 
against his side. 

“What is this?” Dennison asked. 

“Hand it over,” the man said. 

Dennison was stunned. How 
could anyone have known about 
his discovery? And how could they 
dare try to rob him in a public 
subway car? 

Then he realized that they were 
probably just after his money. 

“I don’t have much on me,” 
Dennison said hoarsely, reaching 
for his wallet. 

The man on his left leaned over 
and slapped the briefcase. “Not 
money,” he said. “The immortality 
stuff.” 

¥N some unaccountable fashion, 
they knew. What if he refused 
to give up his briefcase? Would 
they dare fire the automatic in 



the subway? It was a very small 
caliber weapon. Its noise might 
not even be heard above the sub- 
way’s roar. And probably they felt 
justified in taking the risk for a 
prize as great as the one Dennison 
carried. 

He looked at them quickly. 
They were mild-looking men, 
quietly, almost somberly dressed. 
Something about their clothing 
jogged Dennison’s memory un- 
pleasantly, but he didn’t have time 
to place the recollection. The auto- 
matic was digging painfully into 
his ribs. 

The subway was coming to a 
station. Dennison glanced at the 
man on his left and caught the 
glint of light on a tiny hypodermic. 

Many inventors, involved only 
in their own thoughts, are slow 
of reaction. But Dennison had 
been a gunnery officer in the Navy 
and had seen his share of action. 
He was damned if he was going to 
give up his invention so easily. 

He jumped from his seat and 
the hypo passed through the sleeve 
of his coat, just missing his arm. 
He swung the briefcase at the 
man with the automatic, catching 
him across the forehead with the 
metal edge. As the doors opened, 
he ran past a popeyed subway 
guard, up the stairs and into the 
street. 

The two men followed, one of 
them streaming blood from his 
forehead. Dennison ran, looking 



146 



GALAXY 




wildly around for a policeman. 

The men behind him were 
screaming, “Stop, thief! Police! 
Police! Stop that man!” 

Apparently they were also pre- 
pared to face the police and to 
claim the briefcase and bottle as 
their own. Ridiculous! Yet the 
complete and indignant confidence 
in their shrill voices unnerved 
Dennison. He hated a scene. 

Still, a policeman would be best. 
The briefcase was filled with proof 
of who he was. Even his name was 
initialed on the outside of the brief- 
case. One glance would tell any- 
one ... 

He caught a flash of metal from 
his briefcase, and, still running, 
looked at it. He was shocked to 
see a metal plate fixed to the cow- 
hide, over the place where his 
initials had been. The man on his 
left must have done that when he 
slapped the briefcase. 

Dennison dug at the plate with 
his fingertips, but it would not 
come off. 

It read, Property of Edward 
James Flaherty, Smithheld Insti- 
tute. 

Perhaps a policeman wouldn’t 
be so much help, after all. 

But the problem was academic, 
for Dennison saw no policeman 
along the crowded Bronx street. 
People stood aside as he ran past, 
staring open-mouthed, offering 
neither assistance nor interference. 
But the men behind him were 



still screaming, “Stop the thief! 
Stop the thief!” 

The entire long block was 
alerted. The people, like some 
sluggish beast goaded reluctantly 
into action, began to make tenta- 
tive movements toward Dennison, 
impelled by the outraged cries of 
his pursuers. 

TTNLESS he balanced the. scales 
^ of public opinion, some do- 
gooder was going to interfere 
soon. Dennison conquered his shy- 
ness and pride, and called out, 
“Help me! They’re trying to rob 
me! Stop them!” 

But his voice lacked the moral 
indignation, the absolute convic- 
tion of his two shrill-voiced pur- 
suers. A burly young man stepped 
forward to block Dennison’s way, 
but at the last moment a women 
pulled him back. 

“Don’t get into trouble, Char- 
ley.” 

‘Why don’t someone call a 
cop?” 

"Yeah, where are the cops?” 
“Over at a big fire on 178th 
Street, I hear.” 

“We oughta stop that guy.” 
“I’m willing if you’re willing.” 
Dennison’s way was suddenly 
blocked by four grinning youths, 
teen-agers in black motorcycle 
jackets and boots, excited by the 
chance for a little action, delighted 
at the opportunity to hit someone 
in the name of law and order. 



FOREVER 



147 




Dennison saw them, swerved 
suddenly and sprinted across the 
street A bus loomed in front of 
him. 

He hurled himself out of its 
way, fell, got up again and ran on. 

His pursuers were delayed by 
the dense flow of traffic. Their 
high-pitched cries faded as Den- 
nison turned into a side street, ran 
down its length, then down an- 
other. 

He was in a section of massive 
apartment buildings. His lungs felt 
like a blast furnace and his left 
side seemed to be sewed together 
with red-hot wire. There was no 
help for it, he had to rest. 

It was then that the first bullet, 
fired from a silenced weapon, 
chipped a granite wall not three 
inches from his head. That was 
when Dennison realized the full 
extent of his carelessness. 

He pulled the bottle out of his 
pocket. He had hoped to carry out 
more experiments on the serum 
before trying it on human beings. 
Now there was no choice. 

Dennison yanked out the stop- 
per and drained the contents. 

Immediately he was running 
again, as a second bullet scored 
the granite wall. The great blocks 
of apartments loomed endlessly 
ahead of him, silent and alien. 
There were no walkers upon the 
streets. There was only Dennison, 
running more slowly now past the 
immense, blank-faced apartments. 



A LONG black car came up 
behind him, its searchlight 
probing into doors and alleys. Was 
it the police? 

“That’s him!” cried the shrill, 
unnerving voice of one of Den- 
nison’s pursuers. 

Dennison ducked into a narrow 
alley between buildings, raced 
down it and into the next street 

There were two cars on that 
street, at either end of the block, 
their headlights shining toward 
each other, moving slowly to trap 
him in the middle. The alley 
gleamed with light now, from the 
first car’s headlights shining down 
it. He was surrounded. 

Dennison raced to the nearest 
apartment building and yanked at 
the door. It was locked. The two 
cars were almost even with him. 
And, looking at them, Dennison re^ 
membered the unpleasant jog his 
memory had given him earlier. 

The two cars were hearses. 

The men in the subway, with 
their solemn faces, solemn cloth- 
ing, subdued neckties, shrill, in- 
dignant voices — they had re- 
minded him of undertakers. They 
had been undertakers! 

Of course! Of course! Oil com- 
panies might want to block the in- 
vention of a cheap new fuel which 
could put them out of business; 
steel corporations might try to 
stop the development of an 
inexpensive, stronger - than - steel 
plastic . 



FOREVER 



149 




And the production of an im- 
mortality serum would put the un- 
dertakers out of business. 

His progress, and the progress 
of thousands of other researchers 
in biology, must have been 
watched. And when he made his 
discovery, they had been ready. 

The hearses stopped, and som- 
ber-faced, respectable-looking men 
in black suits and pearl-gray neck- 
ties poured out and seized him. 
The briefcase was yanked out of 
his hand. He felt the prick of a 
needle in his shoulder. Then, with 
no transitional dizziness, he passed 
out. 

TIE came to sitting in an arm- 
chair. There were armed men 
on either side of him. In front of 
him stood a small, plump, undis- 
tinguished-looking man in sedate 
clothing. 

“My name is Mr. Bennet,” the 
plump man said. “I wish to beg 
your forgiveness, Mr. Dennison, 
for the violence to which you were 
subjected. We found out about 
your invention only at the last 
moment and therefore had to im- 
provise. The bullets were meant 
only to frighten and delay you. 
Murder was not our intention.” 

“You merely wanted to steal 
my discovery,” Dennison said. 

“Not at all,” Mr. Bennet told 
him. “The secret of immortality 
has been in our possession for 
quite some time.” 



“I see. Then you want to keep 
immortality from the public in 
order to safeguard your damned 
undertaking business!” 

“Isn’t that rather a naive view?” 
Mr. Bennet asked, smiling. “As it 
happens, my associates and I are 
not undertakers. We took on the 
disguise in order to present an un- 
derstandable motive if our plan to 
capture you had misfired. In that 
event, others would have believed 
exactly — and only — what you 
thought: that our purpose was to 
safeguard our business.” 

Dennison frowned and watch- 
fully waited. 

“Disguises come easily to us,” 
Mr. Bennet said, still smiling. “Per- 
haps you have heard rumors about 
a new carburetor suppressed by 
the gasoline companies, or a new 
food source concealed by the great 
food suppliers, or a new synthetic 
hastily destroyed by the cotton- 
owning interests. That was us. 
And the inventions ended up here.” 
“You’re trying to impress me,” 
Dennison said. 

“Certainly.” 

“Why did you stop me from 
patenting my immortality serum?” 
“The world is not ready for it 
yet,” said Mr. Bennet 

“It isn’t ready for a lot of 
things,” Dennison said. “Why 
didn’t you block the atom bomb?” 
‘We tried, disguised as mer- 
cenary coal and oil interests. But 
we failed. However, we have suc- 



150 



GALAXY 




ceeded with a surprising number 
of things.” 

“But what’s the purpose behind 
it all?” 

“Earth’s welfare,” Mr. Bennet 
said promptly. “Consider what 
would happen if the people were 
given your veritable immortality 
serum. The problems of birth rate, 
food production, living space all 
would be aggravated. Tensions 
would mount, war would be im- 
minent—” 

“So what?” Dennison chal- 
lenged. “That’s how things are 
right now, without immortality. 
Besides, there have been cries of 
doom about every new invention 
or discovery. Gunpowder, the 
printing press, nitroglycerine, the 
atom bomb, they were all sup- 
posed to destroy the race. But 
mankind has learned how to 
handle them. It had to! You can’t 
turn back the clock, and you can’t 
un-discover something. If it’s there, 
mankind must deal with it!” 

“Yes, in a bumbling, bloody, in- 
efficient fashion,” said Mr. Ben- 
net, with an expression of distaste. 

“Well, that’s how Man is.” 

“Not if he’s properly led,” Mr. 
Bennet said. 

“No?” 

f^ERTAINLY not,” said Mr. 

Bennet. “You see, the im- 
mortality serum provides a solu- 
tion to the problem of political 
power. Rule by a permanent and 



enlightened elite is by far the best 
form of government; infinitely bet- 
ter than the blundering inefficien- 
cies of democratic rule. But 
throughout history, this elite, 
whether monarchy, oligarchy, dic- 
tatorship or junta, has been un- 
able to perpetuate itself. Leaders 
die, the followers squabble for 
power, and chaos is close behind. 
With immortality, this last flaw 
would be corrected. There would 
be no discontinuity of leadership, 
for the leaders would always be 
there.” 

“A permanent dictatorship,” 
Dennison said. 

“Yes. A permanent, benevolent 
rule by small, carefully chosen 
elite corps, based upon the sole 
and exclusive possession of im- 
mortality. It’s historically inevit- 
able. The only question is, who is 
going to get control first?” 

“And you think you are?” Den- 
nison demanded. 

“Of course. Our organization is 
still small, but absolutely solid. It 
is bolstered by every new inven- 
tion that comes into our hands and 
by every scientist who joins our 
ranks. Our time will come, Den- 
nison! We’d like to have you with 
us, among the elite.” 

“You want me to join you?” 
Dennison asked, bewildered. 

“We do. Our organization needs 
creative scientific minds to help us 
in our work, to help us save man- 
kind from itself.” 



FOREVER 



151 




“Count me out ” Dennison said, 
his heart beating fast 
“You won’t join us?” 

“I’d like to see you all hanged.” 
Mr. Bennet nodded thoughtful- 
ly and pursed his small lips. “You 
have taken your own serum, have 
you not?” 

Dennison nodded. “I suppose 
that means you kill me now?” 
“We don’t kill,” Mr. Bennet 
said. “We merely wait. I think you 
^ are a reasonable man, and I think 
you’ll come to see things our way. 
We’ll be around a long time. So 
will you. Take him away.” 

Dennison was led to an elevator 
that dropped deep into the Earth. 
He was marched down a long pas- 
sageway lined with armed men. 
They went through four massive 
doors. At the fifth, Dennison was 
pushed inside alone, and the door 
was locked behind him. 

He was in a large, well-fur- 
nished apartment. There were per- 
haps twenty people in the room, 
and they came forward to meet 
him. 

One of them, a stocky, bearded 
man, was an old college acquaint- 
ance of Dennison’s. 

“Jim Ferris?” 

“That’s right,” Ferris said. “Wel- 
come to the Immortality Club, 
Dennison.” 

“I read you were killed in an 
air crash last year.” 

“I merely-disappeared,” Ferris 
said, with a rueful smile, “after in- 



venting the immortality serum. 
Just like the others.” 

“All of them?” 

“Fifteen of the men here in- 
vented the serum independently. 
The rest are successful inventors 
in other fields. Our oldest mem- 
ber is Doctor Li, a serum discov- 
erer, who disappeared from San 
Francisco in 1911. You are our 
latest acquisition. Our clubhouse 
is probably the most carefully 
guarded place on Earth.” 

"T4ENNISON said, “Nineten- 
eleven!” Despair flooded him 
and he sat down heavily in a 
chair. “Then there’s no possibility 
of rescue?” 

“None. There are only four 
choices available to us,” Ferris 
said. “Some have left us and joined 
the Undertakers. Others have sui- 
cided. A few have gone insane. 
The rest of us have formed the 
Immortality Club.” 

“What for?” Dennison bewil- 
deredly asked. 

“To get out of this place!” said 
Ferris. “To escape and give our 
discoveries to the world. To stop 
those hopeful little dictators up- 
stairs.” 

“They must know what you’re 
planning.” 

“Of course. But they let us live 
because, every so often, one of us 
gives up and joins them. And they 
don’t think we can ever break 
out. They’re much too smug. It’s 



152 



GALAXY 




the basic defect of all power-elites, 
and their eventual undoing” 

“You said this was the most 
closely guarded place on Earth?” 
“It is,” Ferris said. 

“And some of you have been 
trying to break out for fifty years? 
Why, it’ll take forever to escape!” 
“Forever is exactly how long 
we have,”_ said Ferris. “But we 
hope it won’t take quite that long. 
Every new man brings new ideas, 
plans. One of them is bound to 
work.” 

“Forever,” Dennison said, his 
face buried in his hands. 

“You can go back upstairs and 
join them,” Ferris said, with a 
hard note to his voice, “or you can 
suicide, or just sit in a corner and 
go quietly mad. Take your pick.” 
Dennison looked up. “I must be 
honest with you and with myself. 

I don’t think we can escape. Fur- 
thermore, I don’t think any of you 
really believe we can.” 

Ferris shrugged his shoulders. 
“Aside from that,” Dennison 
said, “I think it’s a damned good 
idea. If you’ll bring me up to date, 
I’ll contribute whatever I can to 
the Forever Project. And let’s 
hope their complacency lasts.” 

“It will,” Ferris said. 

r T , HE escape did not take for- 
ever, of course. In one hundred 
and thirty-seven years, Dennison 
and his colleagues made their suc- 
cessful breakout and revealed the 



Undertakers’ Plot The Undertak- 
ers were tried before the High 
Court on charges of kidnapping, 
conspiracy to overthrow the gov- 
ernment, and illegal possession of 
immortality. They were found 
guilty on all counts and summarily 
executed. 

Dennison and his colleagues 
were also in illegal possession of 
immortality, which is the privilege 
only of our governmental elite. 
But the death penalty was waived 
in view of the Immortality Club’s 
service to the State. 

This mercy was premature, 
however. After some months the 
members of the Immortality Club 
went into hiding, with the avowed 
purpose of overthrowing the Elite 
Rule and disseminating immortali- 
ty among the masses. Project 
Forever, as they termed it, has 
received some support from dissi- 
dents, who have not yet been ap- 
prehended. It cannot be consid- 
ered a serious threat. 

But this deviationist action in 
no way detracts from the glory of 
the Club’s escape from the Under- 
takers. The ingenious way in which 
Dennison and his colleagues broke 
out of their seemingly impregnable 
prison, using only a steel belt 
buckle, a tungsten filament, three 
hens’ eggs, and twelve chemicals 
that can be readily obtained from 
the human body, is too well known 
to be repeated here.

Time Killer 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

Conclusion of Four Parts 

Far from clearing the slate , dying had only 
doubled Blaine's troubles — and f/iese people 
wanted him to die again to square himself! 

Illustrated by WOOD 



SYNOPSIS 

T homas blaine, a 

young yacht designer, is 
killed in an auto accident 
He comes to life 158 years in the 
future , in a different body. He is 
questioned by 

MR. REILLY, a choleric old 
man, president of Rex Corpora- 
tion, which has snatched Blaine’s 
mind into the future. But Blaine 
is not the man they were trying to 
save. 

MARIE THORNE, a cold and 
beautiful young woman employed 
by Reilly, tells Blaine about the 
HEREAFTER CORPORA- 
TION, of which Rex is a subsidi- 
ary. This corporation guarantees, 
for a high fee, a life after death. 
Blaine also learns about 

THE THRESHOLD, a ghostly 
interface region between Earth and 
the hereafter, a temporary stop- 



ping-off place for spirits before 
they go on to whatever is their 
ultimate destination. 

Hereafter, Inc., has been trying 
to sell its version of life after death 
to the organized religions, without 
success. Reilly intended to bring a 
religious leader from 1958 to 
2112, to endorse the scientific here- 
after. Instead he got Blaine, who 
remembers nothing of his time in 
Threshold. 

Reilly attempts a reincarnation 
into a host body, but a spirit fights 
him for possession, and wins. 

SMITH, as the new possessor 
comes to be called, entered the 
body after it had been dead too 
long. He is therefore afflicted with 
a loathsome disease known as 
Zombieism. Smith has lost his 
memory, but thinks he knows 
Blaine from somewhere.

GALAXY 




Marie Thome takes Blaine 
away from the Rex Building for 
his safety and turns him over to 

CARL. ORC, for safekeeping. 
But Ore is head of a gang of body 
snatchers. Blaine is made prisoner 
with 

RAY MELHILL, who tells him 
that their bodies will be used 
for illegal reincarnation attempts. 
Blaine is rescued by Marie Thorne, 
who didn’t know Ore’s occupation. 
When they try to rescue Melhill, it 
is too late. Melhill is already dead, 
and his body inhabited by another 
man. 

~W\L,AINE goes out in search of 
work, but finds no jobs he can 
perform in the complex world of 
2112. He receives a call from 
THE SPIRITUAL SWITCH- 
BOARD, an organization which 
maintains contact with spirits in 
the Threshold. He speaks with 
Ray, who has survived the death 
trauma. Melhill, now a clairvoyant 
spirit, warns Blaine that he will 
be haunted. This is a serious mat- 
ter, for ghosts are destructive 
minds that have gone insane dur- 
ing the death trauma. 

Blaine finds temporary employ- 
ment on a hunt, a form of suicide 
paid for by a wealthy man named 
Hull. Blaine is aided through its 
dangers by the veteran hunter 
Sammy Jones. 

When Blaine returns to his 
room, he meets his ghost, a polter- 



geist who tries to kill him with a 
levitated chair. He is rescued by 
the zombie Smith, who feels that 
his destiny is involved with 
Blaine’s. Smith leads him xmder- 
ground, where the outcast zombies 
live. After performing an exor- 
cism on the spirit, they find it was 
Reilly, blaming Blaine tor the 
failure of his reincarnation, who 
was haunting him. 

Blaine finds a job, and hears 
the sensory recording which was 
made when he first came into 
2112. It is now being sold illicitly 
around the city. He meets 

ALICE KRANCH, whose hus- 
band formerly occupied Blaine’s 
body, before he sold it to Rex in 
exchange for Hereafter insurance. 

But Blaine’s biggest moment is 
when he is offered the greatest 
prize of the age— free Hereafter in- 
surance, given as a grant from a 
textile organization. Blaine accepts 
and is given the treatment which 
guarantees him a life after death. 

Marie tells him he accepted too 
hastily. The textile company is 
owned by the Rex Corporation. 
Now they can kill Blaine legally. 
They are planning to do so be- 
cause of the recording, now being 
sold illegally all over. This record- 
ing shows that Blaine remembers 
nothing of the Threshold, in which 
he lived between 1958 and 2112. 
The organized religions can use 
this evidence against Hereafter, 
Inc.’s claims. The corporation is

calling the record a fraud and must 
get rid of Blaine before he can be 
questioned. 

Blaine leaves his apartment, but 
the veteran hunter Sammy Jones 
has already found him. For old 
times f sake, Jones gives him a 
half-hour start. 

Blaine is unable to buy a 
weapon. By nightfall, he is 
hemmed in by hired killers. A sub- 
way grate gives way under him 
and he falls heavily. He knows he 
must drag himself away from the 
opening, to safety— but he can’t. He 
passes out. 

25. 

W HEN he revived, Blaine de- 
cided that he didn’t like the 
hereafter. It was dark, lumpy, and 
smelled of oil and slime. Also, his 
head ached, and his back felt as 
though it had been broken in three 
places. 

Could a spirit ache? Blaine 
moved, and discovered that he 
still had a body. As a matter of 
fact, he felt all body. Apparently 
he wasn’t in the hereafter. 

“Just rest a minute,” a voice 
said 

“Who is it?” Blaine asked into 
the impenetrable darkness. 
“Smith.” 

“Oh. You.” Blaine sat up and 
held his throbbing head. “How did 
you do it, Smith?” 

“I nearly didn’t,” the zombie 



told him. “As soon as you were 
declared Quarry, I came for you. 
Some of my friends down here vol- 
unteered to help, but you were 
moving too fast. I shouted to you 
when you came out of the pawn- 
shop.” 

“I thought I heard a voice,” 
Blaine said. 

“If you’d turned around, we 
could have taken you in there and 
then. But you didn’t, so we fol- 
lowed. A few times we opened 
subway grates and manhole covers 
for you, but it was hard to gauge 
it right. We were a little late each 
time.” 

“But not the last time,” Blaine 
said. 

“Only because I opened a grate 
right under you. I’m sorry you hit 
your head.” 

“Where am I?” 

“I pulled you out of the main 
line,” Smith said. “You’re in a 
side passage. The hunters can’t 
find you here.” 

Blaine once again could find no 
adequate words for thanking 
Smith. And Smith once again 
wanted no thanks. 

“I’m not doing it for you, Blaine. 
It’s for me. I need you.” 

“Have you found out why yet?” 

“Not yet,” Smith said. 

Blaine's eyes, adjusting to the 
gloom, could make out the out- 
line of the zombie’s head and 
shoulders. 

‘What now?” he asked. 



TIME KILLER

“Now you're safe. We can bring 
you underground as far as New 
Jersey. From there you’re on your 
own. But I don’t think you should 
have much trouble then.” 

“What are we waiting for now?” 
“Mr. Kean. I need his permis- 
sion to take you through the pas- 
sageways.” 

They waited. In a few minutes,, 
Blaine was able to make out Mr. 
Kean’s thin shape, leaning on the 
big Negro’s arm, coming toward 
him. 

“I’m sorry about your troubles,” 
Kean said, sitting down beside 
Blaine with overwhelming weari- 
ness. ‘It’s a great pity.” 

“Mr. Kean,” Smith said, “if I 
could just be allowed to take him 
through the old Holland Tunnel, 
into New Jersey—” 

“I’m truly sorry,” said Kean, 
“but I can’t allow it.” Blaine 
looked around and saw that he 
was surrounded by a dozen ragged 
zombies. 

“I’ve spoken to the hunters,” 
Kean went on, “and I have given 
them my guarantee that you will 
be back on the surface streets with- 
in half an hour. You must leave 
now, Blaine.” 

“But why?” 

“We simply can’t afford to help 
you. I was taking an unusual risk 
the first time, allowing you to de- 
file Reilly’s tomb. But I did it for 
Smith, because his destiny seems 
linked with yours in some way, 



and Smith is one of my people. 
But this is too much. You know 
we are allowed to live under- 
ground upon sufferance only.” 

“I know,” Blaine said. 

44 C MITH should have consid- 
^ ered the consequences,” 
Kean continued. “When he opened 
that grating for you, the hunters 
poured in. They didn’t find you, 
but they knew you were down 
here somewhere. So they searched, 
Blaine, they searched! Dozens of 
them, exploring our passageways, 
pushing our people around, threat- 
ening, shouting, talking on their 
little radios. Reporters came, too, 
and even idle spectators. Some of 
the younger hunters got nervous 
and started shooting at the zom- 
bies.” 

“I’m very sorry about that,” 
Blaine said. 

“It wasn’t your fault. But Smith 
should have known better. The 
world of the underground is not a 
sovereign kingdom. We exist only 
on a toleration which might be 
wiped out at any time. So I spoke 
to the hunters and the reporters.” 
“What did you tell them?” 
Blaine asked. 

“I told them that a faulty grate 
had given way beneath you. I said 
you had fallen in by accident and 
had crawled into hiding. I assured 
them that no zombie had been in- 
volved in this, that we found you 
and would place you back on the 



160 



GALAXY 




surface streets within half an hour. 
They accepted my word and left. 
I wish I could have done other- 
wise.” 

“I don’t blame you,” said Blaine, 
getting slowly to his feet 

“I didn’t specify where you 
would emerge,” Kean said. “At the 
very least, you’ll have a better 
chance than before. I wish I could 
do more, but X cannot allow the 
underground to become a stage for 
hunts. We must stay neutral, an- 
noy no one, frighten no one. Only 
in that way will we survive until 
an age of understanding is 
reached.” 

“Where am I going to come 
out?” 

“I have chosen an unused sub- 
way exit at West 79th Street,” Mr. 
Kean said. “You should have a 
good chance from there. And I 
have done one more thing which 
I probably shouldn't have done.” 

“What's that?” 

“I have contacted a friend of 
yours, who will be waiting at the 
exit. But please don’t tell anyone 
about it. let’s hurry now!” 

Mr. Kean led the procession 
through the winding underground 
maze, and Blaine brought up the 
rear, his headache slowly subsid- 
ing. Soon they stopped beside a 
concrete staircase. 

“Here is the exit,” Kean said. 
“Good luck, Blaine.” 

“Thanks,” said Blaine. “And, 
Smith — thanks.” 



"I’ve tried my best for you,” 
Smith said. “If you die, I’ll prob- 
ably die. If you live, I’ll keep on 
trying to remember.” 

“And if you do remember?” 

“Then I’ll come and visit you,” 
Smith said. 

Blaine nodded and walked up 
the staircase. 

It was full night outside and 
79th Street seemed deserted. 
Blaine stood beside the exit, look- 
ing around, wondering what to 
do. 

“Blaine!” 

Someone was calling him. But 
it was not Marie, as he had ex- 
pected. It was a man’s voice, some- 
one he knew — Sammy Jones, per- 
haps, or Theseus. 

He turned quickly back to the 
subway exit It was closed and 
fastened securely. 

26. 

ff^TOM! Tom, it’s me!” breathed 
a thin voice, with great effort 

“Ray?” called Blaine, aston- 
ished. 

“Of course! Keep your voice 
down. There are hunters not far 
away. Wait now.” 

Blaine waited, crouched beside 
the barred subway exit, peering 
around. He could see no sign of 
Melhill. There was no ectoplasmic 
vapor, nothing except a whisper- 
ing voice. 

“Okay,” Melhill said. “Walk 



TIME KILLER 



161 




west now. Move along quickly.” 
Blaine walked, sensing Melhill’s 
invisible presence hovering near 
him. He said, “Ray, how come?” 
“It’s about time I was some 
help,” said Melhill. “That old 
Kean contacted your girl friend 
and she got in touch with me 
through the Spiritual Switchboard. 
Hold it! Stop right here.” 

Blaine ducked back against the 
corner of a building. A heli cruised 
slowly by at housetop level. 

“Hunters,” Melhill said. “There’s 
a field day on you, kid. Reward 
posted. Even a reward for infor- 
mation leading to. Tom, I told 
Marie I’d try to help. Don’t know 
how long I can. Drains me. It’s 
hereafter for me after this.” 
“Ray, I don’t know how—” 

“Cut it out Look, Tom, I can't 
talk much. Marie has fixed a deal 
with some friends of hers. They?ve 
got a plan, if I can get you to 
them. Stop!” 

Blaine stopped and found shel- 
ter behind a mailbox. Long seconds 
passed. Then three hunters hurried 
by, sidearms ready. After they 
turned a comer, Blaine was able to 
start walking again. 

“Some eyes you have,” he said 
to Melhill. 

“The vision’s pretty good up 
here,” said Melhill. “Cross this 
street fast.” 

Blaine sprinted across. For the 
next fifteen minutes, at Melhill’s 
instructions, he wound in and out 



of streets, advancing and retreating 
across the battleground of the city. 

“This is it,” Melhill said at last 
“That door over there, number 
341. You made it! I’ll see you, 
Tom. Watch—” 

At that moment, two men 
rounded a comer, stopped, and 
stared hard at Blaine. One said, 
“Hey, that’s the guy!” 

“What guy?” 

“The guy they got the reward 
out for. Hey, youF’ 

They ran forward. Blaine, his 
fists swinging, quickly chopped the 
first man into unconsciousness. He 
whirled, looking for the second, but 
Melhill had the situation well in 
control. 

The second man had his hands 
over his head, trying to guard him- 
self. A garbage can cover, levitat- 
ing mysteriously, was clanging 
angrily around his ears. Blaine 
stepped forward and finished the 
job. 

“Damn good,” Melhill said, his 
voice very weak. “Always wanted 
to try ghosting. But it drains . 
Luck, Tom!” 

“Ray!” Blaine strained his ears, 
but there was no answer, and the 
sense of Melhill’s presence was 
gone. 

Blaine waited no longer. He 
went to number 341, opened the 
door and stepped in. 

He was in a narrow hallway. At 
the end of it was a door. Blaine 
knocked. 



162 



GALAXY 




“Come in,” he was told. 

He opened the door and walked 
into a small, dingy, heavily cur- 
tained room. 

Blaine had thought himself 
proof against any further surprises. 
But it gave him a start all the 
same to see, grinning at him, Carl 
Ore, the body snatcher. And sit- 
ting beside him, also grinning, 
was Joe, the little Transplant 
peddler. 

27. 

"O LAINE made an automatic 
move back toward the door, 
but Ore beckoned him in. The 
body snatcher was unchanged, still 
very tall and thin, his tanned face 
long and mournful, his eyes nar- 
row, direct and honest. His clothes 
still hung awkwardly on him, as 
though he were more used to levis 
than to tailored slacks. 

“We were expecting you,” Ore 
said. “You remember Joe .” 

Blaine nodded, remembering 
very well the furtive-eyed little 
man who had distracted his atten- 
tion so that Ore could drug his 
drink. 

“Happy to see you again,” Joe 
said. 

“I’ll bet,” said Blaine, not mov- 
ing from the door. 

“Come in and sit down,” Ore 
said. “We ain’t planning to harm 
you, Tom. Fact. Let’s let bygones 
be bygones.” 



“You tried to kill me.” 

“That was business,” Ore said 
in his straightforward fashion. 
“We’re on the same side now.” 
“How can I be sure of that?” 
“No man,” Ore stated, “has ever 
questioned my honesty. When I’m 
bought, I stay bought Miss Thome 
hired us to get yon safe out of the 
country, and we intend to do same. 
Sit down and let’s discuss it Are 
you hungry?” 

Reluctantly, Blaine sat down. 
There were sandwiches on a table, 
and a bottle of red wine. He re- 
alized that he hadn’t eaten all day. 
He started wolfing down sand- 
wiches while Ore lighted a thin 
brown cigar. 

“You know,” Ore said, exhaling 
blue smoke, “I very nearly didn’t 
take this job. Not that the money 
wasn’t right; I think Miss Thome 
was more than generous. But, Tom, 
this is one of the biggest manhunts 
our fair city’s seen for quite a 
while. Ever see anything like it, 
Joe?” 

“Never,” said Joe, shaking his 
head rapidly. “Town’s covered 
like flypaper.” 

“Rex really wants you,” Ore 
went on. “They’ve set their little 
hearts on nailing your corpus 
where they can see it. Makes a 
man nervous, bucking an organiza- 
tion that size. But it’s a challenge, 
a really man-sized challenge.” 
“Carl likes a big challenge,” Joe 
said. 



TIME KILLER 



163 




“I admit that,” said Ore. “Where 
there’s a big challenge, there’s a 
big profit to be made from it.” 

660 UT where can I go?” Blaine 
asked. “Where won’t Rex 
find me?” 

“Just about nowhere,” Ore said 
sadly. 

“Off the Earth? Mars? Venus?” 

“Even worse than Earth. The 
planets have just a few towns and 
small cities. Everybody knows 
everybody else. The news would 
be all over in a week. Also, you 
wouldn’t fit in. Aside from the 
Chinese on Mars, the planets are 
still populated mostly with scien- 
tific types and their families, and 
a few youth-training programs. 
You wouldn’t like it.” 

“Where then?” 

“That’s what I asked Miss 
Thome,” Ore said. “We discussed 
several possibilities. First, there’s 
a zombie-making operation. I 
could perform it. Rex would never 
search for you underground.” 

“I’d rather die,” said Blaine. 

“I would too,” Ore agreed. “So 
we ruled it out. We thought about 
finding you a little farm in the 
Atlantic Abyss. Pretty lonely ter- 
ritory out there. But it takes a 
special mentality to live undersea 
and like it, and we didn’t figure 
you had it. You’d probably crack 
up. So, after due consideration, we 
decided the best place for you was 
in the Marquesas.” 



“The what?” asked Blaine, try- 
ing to place the name. 

“The Marquesas. They’re a 
scattered group of small islands, 
originally Polynesian, out toward 
the middle of the Pacific Ocean. 
They’re not too far from Tahiti.” 
“The South Seas,” Blaine said. 
“Right We figured you should 
feel more at home there than any- 
where else on Earth. It’s just like 
the 20th century, I’m told. And 
even more important, Rex might 
leave you alone.” 

“Why would they?” 

“For obvious reasons, Tom. 
Why do they want to kill you in 
the first place? Because they 
snatched you illegally from the 
past and they’re worried about 
what the government’s going to 
do about it. But your going to the 
Marquesas removes you from the 
jurisdiction of the U.S. govern- 
ment. Without you, there’s no 
case. And your going so far is a 
sign to Rex of your good faith. It 
certainly isn’t the action of a man 
who’s going to blab to Uncle Sam. 

“Also,” Ore added, “the Mar- 
quesas are an independent little 
nation since the French gave them 
up, so Rex would have to get spe- 
cial permission to hunt you there. 
On the whole, it should be just too 
much trouble for everyone con- 
cerned. The U.S. government will 
undoubtedly drop the matter, and 
I think Rex will leave you alone.” 
“Is that for certain?” 



164 



GALAXY 




“Of course not It's conjecture. 
But its reasonable.” 

“Couldn’t we make a deal with 
Rex beforehand?” 

Ore shook his head. “In order 
to bargain, Tom, you have to have 
something to bargain with. As long 
as you’re in New York, its easier 
and safer for them to kill you.” 

“I guess you’re right,” Blaine 
said. “How are you going to get 
me out?” 

/~kRC and Joe looked at each 
” other uncomfortably. Ore 
said, “Well, that was our big prob- 
lem. There just didn’t seem to be 
any way of getting you out alive.” 
“Heli or jet?” 

“They have to stop at the air 
tolls, and hunters are waiting at 
all of them. Surface vehicle is 
equally out of the question.” 
“Disguise?” 

“Maybe it would have worked 
during the first hour of the hunt 
Now it’s impossible, even if we 
could get you a complete plastic 
surgery job. By now the hunters 
are equipped with identity scan- 
ners. They’d see through you in a 
moment.” 

“Then there’s no way out?” 
Ore and Joe exchanged another 
uneasy glance. 

“There is,” Ore said. “Just one 
way. But you probably won’t like 
it” 

“I like to stay alive. What is 
it?” 



Ore paused and lighted another 
cigar. “We plan to quick-freeze 
you, like for spaceship travel. Then 
we’ll ship your carcass out in a 
crate of frozen beef. Your body 
will be in the center of the load, 
so most likely it won’t be de- 
tected.” 

“Sounds risky,” Blaine said. 

“Not too risky ” 

Blaine frowned, sensing some- 
thing wrong. “I’ll be unconscious 
through it, won’t I?” 

After a long pause, Ore said, 
“No.” 

“I won’t?” 

“It can't be done that way,” Ore 
said. “The fact is, you and your 
body will have to separate. That’s 
the part I’m afraid you won’t like.” 

“What in hell are you talking 
about?” Blaine demanded in 
alarm, getting to his feet. 

“Take it easy,” Ore said. “Sit 
down, smoke a cigarette, have 
some more wine. It’s like this, 
Tom. We can’t ship out a quick- 
frozen body with a mind in it The 
hunters are waiting for something 
like that. Can you imagine what 
happens when they run a quick 
scan over that shipment of beef 
and detect a dormant mind in it? 
Up goes the kite! Adieu la mu - 
siquel I’m not trying to con you, 
Tom. It just can’t be done like 
that. Fact.” 

“Then what happens to my 
mind?” asked Blaine, sitting down 
again. 



TIME KILLER 



165 




“That,” Ore said, “is where Joe 
comes in. Tell him, Joe.” 

J OE nodded rapidly. “Trans- 
plant, my friend, is the an- 
swer.” 

“Transplant?” Blaine repeated 
blankly. 

“I told you about it,” Joe said, 
“on that inauspicious evening when 
we first met. Remember? Trans- 
plant, the great pastime, the game 
any number can play, the jolt for 
jaded minds, the tonic for tired 
bodies. WeVe got a worldwide 
network of Transplanters, Mr. 
Blaine. Dedicated people like me 
who know the future lies in Trans- 
plant and work to advance the 
cause. We’re going to key you into 
the organization.” 

“You’re going to ship my mind 
across the country?” Blaine asked. 

“That’s it — from body to body!” 
Joe told him. “Believe me, it’s in- 
structive as well as entertaining.” 
Blaine got to his feet so quickly 
that he knocked over his chair. 
“Like hell!” he said. “I told you 
then and I’m telling you now, I’m 
not playing your lousy little game. 
I’ll take my chances on the street.” 
He started toward the door. 
Joe said, “I know it’s a little 
frightening, but — ” 

“No!” 

Ore shouted, “Damn it, Blaine, 
will you at least let the man 
speak?” 

“All right,” Blaine said. “Speak.” 



Joe poured himself half a glass 
of wine and threw it down. He 
said, “Mr. Blaine, it’s going to be 
difficult explaining this to you, a 
guy from the past. But try to un- 
derstand what I’m saying.” 

Blaine nodded warily. 

“Now then. Transplant is used 
as a sex game these days, and 
that’s how I peddle it. Why? Be- 
cause people are ignorant of its 
better uses, and because ignorant 
people in the government insist 
on banning it. But Transplant is 
a lot more than a game. It’s an 
entire new way of life! And 
like it or not, Transplant repre- 
sents the world of the future.” 
The little pusher’s eyes glowed. 
Blaine sat down again. 

“There are two basic elements 
in human affairs,” Joe said sen- 
tentiously. “One of them is Man’s 
eternal struggle for freedom: free- 
dom of worship, freedom of press 
and assembly, freedom to select 
government — freedom! And the 
other basic element in human af- 
fairs is the effort of any form of 
government to withhold one form 
of freedom or another from the 
people.” 

B LAINE considered this a 
somewhat simplified view of 
human affairs. But he continued 
listening. 

“Government,” Joe said, “with- 
holds freedom, for many reasons. 
For security, for personal profit, 



166 



GALAXY 




for power, or because they feel 
the people are unready for it But 
whatever the reason, the basic 
facts remain: Man strives for free- 
dom, and government strives to 
withhold freedom. Transplant is 
simply one more in a long series 
of the freedoms that Man has as- 
pired to, and that his government 
feels is not good for him.” 

“Sexual freedom?” asked Blaine. 
“No!” Joe cried. “Not that 
there’s anything wrong with sexual 
freedom. But Transplant isn’t pri- 
marily that. Sure, that’s ho>v we’re 
pushing it — for propaganda pur- 
poses. Because people don’t want 
abstract ideas, Mr. Blaine, and 
they don’t go for cold theory. 
They want to know what a free- 
dom will do for them. We show 
them a small part of it, and they 
learn a lot more themselves.” 
“What will Transplant do?” 
“Transplant,” Joe said fervently, 
“gives Man the ability to trans- 
cend the limits imposed by his 
heredity and his environment!” 
“Which means exactly what?” 
“Transplant lets you exchange 
knowledge, bodies, talents and 
skills with anyone who wishes to 
exchange with you. And plenty do. 
Most men don’t want to perform 
a single set of skills all their life, 
no matter how satisfying those 
skills are. Man is too restless a 
creature. Musicians want to be en- 
gineers, advertising men want to 
be hunters, sailors want to be 



writers. But there usually isn’t 
time to acquire and exploit more 
than one set of skills in a lifetime. 
And even if there were time, the 
blind factor of talent is an insur- 
mountable stumbling -block. With 
Transplant, you can get the inborn 
talents, the skills, the knowledge 
that you want. 

“Think about it, Mr. Blaine. 
Why should a man be forced to 
live out his lifetime in a body he 
had no part in selecting? It’s like 
telling him he must live with the 
diseases he’s inherited, and mustn’t 
try to cure them. Man must have 
the freedom to choose the body and 
talents best suited to his person- 
ality needs.” 

“If your plan went through,” 
Blaine said, “you’d simply have a 
bunch of neurotics changing bodies 
every day.” 

“The same general argument 
was raised against the passage of 
every freedom,” Joe said, his eyes 
glittering. “Throughout history it 
was argued that Man didn’t have 
the sense to choose his own re- 
ligion, or that women didn’t have 
the intelligence to use the vote, or 
that people couldn’t be allowed to 
elect their own representatives be- 
cause of the stupid choices they’d 
make. And of course there are 
plenty of neurotics around, people 
who’d louse up heaven itself. But 
you have a greater number — 
a much greater number — of people 
who use their freedoms well.”

J OE lowered his voice to a per- 
suasive whisper. “You must 
realize, Mr. Blaine, that a man is 
not his body, for he receives his 
body accidentally. He is not his 
skills, for those are frequently born 
of necessity. He is not his talents, 
which are produced less by hered- 
ity than by early environmental 
factors. He is not the sicknesses to 
which he may be predisposed, and 
he is not the environment that 
shapes him. 

“A man contains all these things, 
but he is greater than their total. 
He has the power to change his 
environment, cure his diseases, ad- 
vance his skills — and, at last, to 
choose his body and talents! That 
is the next freedom, Mr. Blaine! 
It’s historically inevitable, whether 
you or I or the government like it 
or not. For Man must have every 
possible freedom!” 

Joe finished his fierce and some- 
what incoherent oration red-faced 
and out of breath. Blaine stared at 
the little man with new surprise. 
He was looking, he realized, at a 
genuine revolutionary of the year 
2110 . 

Ore said, “He’s got a point, Tom. 
Transplant is legal in Sweden and 
Ceylon and it doesn’t seem to 
have hurt the moral fiber much.” 
“In time,” said Joe, pouring him- 
self a glass of wine, “the whole 
world will go Transplant. It’s in- 
evitable.” 

“Maybe,” Ore said. “Or maybe 



they’ll invent some new freedom to 
take its place. Anyhow, Tom, you 
can see that Transplant has some 
moral justification. And it’s the 
only way of saying that body of 
yours. What do you say?” 

“Are you a revolutionary, too?” 
Blaine asked. 

Ore grinned. “In a way. I guess 
I’m like the blockade runners dur- 
ing the American Civil War, or the 
guys who sold guns to the South 
Seas natives. They worked for a 
profit, but they weren’t against 
social change.” 

“Well, well,” said Blaine sar- 
donically. “And up to now I 
thought you were just a common 
criminal.” 

“Skip it,” Ore said pleasantly. 
“Are you willing to try?” 

“Certainly. I’m overwhelmed. 
I never thought I’d find myself in 
the advance guard of a social rev- 
olution.” 

Ore smiled and said, “Good. 
Hope it works out for you, Tom. 
Roll up your sleeve. We’d better 
get started.” 

Blaine rolled up his left sleeve, 
Ore took a hypodermic from a 
drawer. 

“This is just to knock you out,” 
Ore explained. “All the apparatus 
is in the next room. When you 
come to, you’ll be a guest in some- 
one else’s mind and your body 
will be traveling cross-country in 
deep-freeze. They’ll be brought 
together as soon as it’s safe.”

“How many minds will I oc- 
cupy?” Blaine asked. “And for how 
long?” 

“I don’t know how many we’ll 
have to use. As for how long in 
each, a few seconds, a few minutes, 
maybe half an hour. We’ll move 
you along as fast as we can. This 
isn’t a full Transplant, you know. 
You won’t be taking over the 
body. You’ll just be occupying a 
small portion of its consciousness 
as an observer. So stay quiet and 
act natural. Got that?” 

Blaine nodded. “What are the 
Marquesas like?” 

“Beautiful,” Ore said, sliding the 
needle into Blaine’s arm. “You’ll 
like it there.” 

Blaine drifted slowly into un- 
consciousness, thinking of palm 
trees, of white surf breaking against 
a coral reef, and of dark-eyed 
maidens worshipping a god of 
stone. The god looked strangely 
like himself. 

28 . 

rpHERE was no sense of 
awakening, no feeling of tran- 
sition. Abruptly, like a brilliantly 
colored slide projected upon a 
white screen, he was conscious. 
Suddenly, like a marionette jerked 
into violent life, he was acting and 
moving. 

He was not completely Thomas 
Blaine. He was Edgar Dyersen as 
well. Or he was Blaine within 



Dyersen, an integral part of Dyer- 
sen’s body, a segment of Dyersen’s 
mind, viewing the world through 
Dyersen’s rheumy eyes, thinking 
Dyersen’s thoughts, experiencing 
all the shadowy half-conscious 
fragments of Dyersen’s memories, 
hopes, fears and desires. And yet 
he was still Blaine. 

Dyersen-Blaine came out of the 
ploughed field and rested against 
his wooden fence. He was a farmer, 
an old-fashioned South Jersey 
truck farmer, with a minimum of 
machines, which he distrusted any- 
how. He was close to seventy and 
in good health. There was still a 
touch of arthritis in his joints, 
which the smart young medico in 
the village had mostly fixed, and 
his back sometimes gave him 
trouble before rain. But he con- 
sidered himself healthy, healthier 
than most, and good for another 
twenty years. 

Dyersen-Blaine started toward 
his cottage. His gray workshirt was 
drenched in acrid sweat, and sweat 
stained his shapeless coveralls. 

In the distance he heard a dog 
barking and saw, blurrily, a yellow 
and brown shape come bounding 
toward him. (Eyeglasses? No, 
thank you. Doing pretty well with 
what I got.) 

“Hey, Champ! Hey, there, boy!” 

The dog ran a circle around 
him, then trotted along beside 
him. He had something gray in 
his jaws, a rat or perhaps a piece 



TIME KILLER 



169 




of meat. Dyersen-Blaine couldn’t 
quite make it out. 

He bent down to pat Champ’s 
head . 

A GAIN there was no sense of 
transition or of the passage of 
time. A new slide was simply pro- 
jected onto the screen and a new 
marionette was jerked into life. 

Now he was Thompson-Blaine, 
nineteen years old, lying on his 
back half dozing on the rough 
planks of a sailing skiff, the main- 
sheet and tiller held loosely in 
one brown hand. To starboard lay 
the low Eastern shore, and to his 
port he could see a bit of Balti- 
more Harbor. The skiff moved 
easily on the light summer breeze 
and water gurgled merrily beneath 
the forefoot. 

Thompson-Blaine rearranged his 
lanky, tanned body on the planks, 
squirming around until he had 
succeeded in propping his feet 
against the mast. He had been 
home just a week, after a two- 
year work and study program on 
Mars. It had sure been interesting, 
especially the archeology and 
speleology. The sand-farming had 
gotten dull sometimes, but he had 
enjoyed driving the harvesting ma- 
chines. 

Now he was home for a two- 
year accelerated college course. 
Then he was supposed to return 
to Mars as a farm manager. That's 
the way his scholarship read. But 



they couldn’t make him go bade 
if he didn’t want to. 

Maybe he would. And maybe 
not 

The girls on Mars were such 
dedicated types. Tough, capable, 
always a little bossy. When he 
went back — if he went back — 
he’d bring his own wife, not look 
for one there. Of course there had 
been Marcia. She’d really been 
something. But her whole kibbutz 
had moved to the South Polar Gap 
and she hadn’t answered his last 
three letters. Maybe she hadn’t 
been so much. 

“Hey, Sandy!” 

Thompson-Blaine looked up 
and saw Eddie Duelitle, sailing his 
Thistle, waving at him. Languidly, 
Thompson-Blaine waved back. 
Eddie was only seventeen, had 
never been off Earth, and wanted 
to be a spaceliner captain. Huh! 
Fat chance! 

The sun was dipping toward the 
horizon and Thompson-Blaine was 
glad to see it go down. He had a 
date tonight with Jennifer Rollins. 
They were going dancing at Stars- 
ling in Baltimore and Dad was 
letting him use the heli. Man, how 
Jennifer had grown in two years! 
And she had a way of looking at 
a guy, sort of coy and bold at the 
same time. No telling what might 
happen after the dance, in the back 
seat of the heli. Maybe nothing. 
But maybe plenty. 

Thompson-Blaine sat up and

put the tiller over. The skiff came 
into the wind and tacked over. It 
was time to return to the yacht 
basin, then home for dinner, 
then . 

HPHE blacksnake whip flicked 
across his back. 

“Get working there, you!” 

Piggot-Blaine redoubled his ef- 
forts, lifting the heavy pick high 
in the air and swinging it down 
into the dusty roadbed. The guard 
stood nearby, shotgun under his 
left arm, whip in his right, its lash 
trailing in the dust. Piggot-Blaine 
knew every line and pore of that 
guard’s thin, stupid face, knew the 
downward twist of the tight little 
mouth, knew the squint of the 
faded eyes even better than he 
knew his own face. 

Just wait, buzzard meat, he si- 
lently told the guard. Your time’s 
a-comirig. Just wait, wait just a 
bit 

The guard moved away, walk- 
ing slowly up and down the line 
of prisoners laboring under the 
white Mississippi sun. Piggot- 
Blaine tried to spit, but couldn’t 
work up enough saliva. He 
thought, you talk about your fine 
modern world? Talk about your 
big old spaceships, your automatic 
farms, your big fine fat old here- 
after? Think that’s how it is? Then 
ask ’em how they build the roads 
in Quilleg County, Northern Mis- 
sissippi. They won’t tell you, so 



you better look for yourself and 
find out ’Cause that’s the kind of 
world it really is! 

Arnie, working in front of him, 
whispered, “You ready, Otis? You 
ready for it?” 

“I’m a-ready,” Piggot-Blaine 
whispered, his broad fingers clench- 
ing and unclenching on the pick’s 
plastic handle. “I’m past ready, 
Arnie.” 

“In a second, then. Watch Jeff.” 

Piggot-Blaine’s hairy chest 
swelled expectantly. He brushed 
lank brown hair from his eyes and 
watched Je'ff, five men ahead on 
the chain. Piggot-Blaine waited, 
his shoulders aching from sunburn. 
There were calloused scars on his 
ankles from the hoofcuffs, and old 
seams on his back from earlier 
whippings. He had a raging thirst 
in his gut. But no dipperful of 
water could ever cut that thirst, 
nothing could, that crazy thirst 
that brought him in here after he’d 
dismembered Gainesville’s single 
saloon and killed that stinking old 
Indian. 

Jeffs hand moved. The chained 
line of prisoners sprang forward. 
Piggot-Blaine jumped toward the 
thin-faced guard, his pick swung 
high, as the guard dropped his 
whip and fumbled to bring up the 
shotgun. 

“Buzzard meat!” Piggot-Blaine 
screamed, and brought the pick 
down fair in the guard’s forehead. 

“Get the keys!” 



TIME KILLER 



171 




Piggot-Blaine grabbed the keys 
from the dead guard’s belt He 
heard a shotgun go off, heard a 
high scream of agony. Anxiously 
he looked up . 

T>AMIREZ-Blaine was piloting 
his heli above the flat Texas 
plains, heading for El Paso. He 
was a serious young man and he 
paid strict attention to his work, 
coaxing the last knot of speed out 
of the old heli so he could reach 
El Paso before Johnson’s Hard- 
ware Store closed. 

He handled the balky rattletrap 
with care, and only an occasional 
thought came through his concen- 
tration, quick thoughts about the 
altitude and compass readings, a 
dance in Guanajuato next week, 
the price of hides in Ciudad 
Juarez. 

The plain was mottled green 
and yellow below him. He glanced 
at his watch, then at the airspeed 
indicator. 

Yes, Ramirez-Blaine thought, 
he would make El Paso before the 
store closed! He might even have 
time for a little . 

r l^YLER-Blaine wiped his mouth 
on his sleeve and sopped up 
the last of the greasy gravy on a 
piece of corn bread. He belched, 
pushed his chair back from the 
kitchen table and stood up. With 
elaborate unconcern, he took a 
cracked bowl from the pantry and 



filled it with scraps of pork, a 
greens and a big piece of corn 
bread. 

“Ed,” his wife said, “what you 
doing?” 

He glanced at her. She was 
gaunt, tangle-haired, faded past her 
years. He looked away, not answer- 
ing. 

“Ed! Tell me, Ed!” 

Tyler-Blaine looked at her in 
annoyance, feeling his ulcer wince 
at the stab of that sharp, worried 
voice. Sharpest voice in all Cali- 
fornia, he told himself, and he’d 
married it. Sharp voice, sharp nose, 
sharp elbows and knees, breast- 
less and barren to boot. Legs to 
support a body, but not for a sec- 
ond’s delight. A belly for filling, 
not for touching. Of all the girls 
in California, he’d doubtless picked 
the sorriest, just like the damn 
fool his Uncle Rafe always said 
he was. 

“Where you taking that bowl of 
food?” she asked. 

“Out to feed the dog,” Tyler- 
Blaine said, moving toward the 
door. 

“We ain’t got a dog! Oh, Ed, 
don’t do it, not tonight!” 

“I’m doin’ it,” he said, glad of 
her discomfort. 

“Please, not tonight. Let him 
shift for himself somewhere else. 
Ed, listen to me! What if the 
town found out?” 

“It’s past sundown,” Tyler- 
Blaine replied, standing beside the 



172 



GALAXY 




door with his bowl of food. 

“People spy” she said. “Ed, if 
they find out, they’ll lynch us. You 
know they will.” 

“You’d look mighty spry from 
the end of a rope,” Tyler-Blaine 
remarked, opening the door. 

“You do it just to spite me!” 
she cried. 

He closed the door behind him. 
Outside, it was deep twilight. 
Tyler-Blaine stood in his yard 
near the unused chicken coop, 
looking around. The only house 
near his was the Flannagans’, a 
hundred yards away. But they 
minded their own business. 

He waited to make sure none 
of the town kids were snooping 
around. Then he walked forward, 
carefully holding the bowl of food. 

TTE reached the edge of the 
scraggly woods and set the 
bowl down. “It’s all right,” he 
called softly. “Come out, Uncle 
Rafe.” 

A man crawled out of the woods 
on all fours. His face was leaden- 
white, his lips bloodless, his eyes 
blank and staring, his features 
coarse and unfinished, like iron 
before tempering or clay before 
firing. A long cut across his neck 
had festered, and his right leg, 
where the townsfolk had broken 
it, hung limp and useless. 

“Thanks, boy,” said Rafe, Tyler- 
Blaine’s zombie uncle. 

The zombie quickly gulped 



down the contents of the bowl. 
When he had finished, Tyler- 
Blaine asked, “How you feeling, 
Uncle Rafe?” 

“Ain’t feeling nothing. This old 
body’s about through. Another 
couple days, maybe a week, and 
I’ll be off your hands.” 

“I’ll take care of you,” Tyler- 
Blaine promised, “just as long as 
you can stay alive, Uncle Rafe. I 
wish I could bring you into the 
house.” 

“No,” the zombie said. “They’d 
find out. This is risky enough . 
Boy, how’s that skinny wife of 
yours?” 

“Just as shrill as ever,” Tyler- 
Blaine sighed. 

The zombie made a sound like 
laughter. “I warned you, boy, ten 
years ago I warned you not to 
marry that gal. Didn’t I?” 

“You sure did, Uncle Rafe. You 
were the only one had sense. Sure 
wish I’d listened to you.” 

“Better if you had, boy. Well, 
I’m going back to my shelter.” 

“You feel confident, Uncle?” 
Tyler-Blaine asked anxiously. 

“That I do.” 

“And you’ll try to die confi- 
dent?” 

“I will, boy. And I’ll get me 
into that Threshold, never you 
fear. And when I do, I’ll keep my 
word. I truly will.” 

“Thank you, Uncle Rafe.” 

“I’ll haunt her, boy, if the good 
Lord grants me Threshold. First

comes that fat doctor that made 
me this. But then comes her turn. 
I’ll haunt her crazy. I’ll haunt her 
till she runs the length of the 
state of California away from 
you!” 

“Thanks, Uncle Rafe.” 

The zombie made a sound like 
laughter again and crawled back 
into the scraggly woods. Tyler- 
Blaine shivered uncontrollably for 
a moment, then picked up the 
empty bowl and walked back to 
the sagging washboard house . 

It /T ARINER-BLAINE adjusted 
the strap of her bathing suit so 
that it clung more snugly to her 
slim, supple young body. She 
slipped the air tank over her back, 
picked up her respirator and walked 
toward the pressure lock. 

“Janice!” 

“Yes, Mother?” she said, turn- 
ing, her face smooth and expres- 
sionless. 

“Where are you going, dear?” 
“Just out for a swim, Mom. I 
thought maybe I’d look at the 
gardens on Level 12.” 

“You aren’t by any chance plan- 
ning to see Hal Leuwin, are you?” 
Had her mother guessed? Mar- 
iner-Blaine smoothed her black 
hair and said, “Certainly not.” 

“All right,” her mother said, half 
smiling and obviously not believ- 
ing her. “Try to be home early, 
dear. You know how worried your 
father gets.” 



Mariner-Blaine stooped and 
gave her mother a quick Ids, then 
hurried into the pressure lock. 

Mother knew - she was sure of 
it! And wasn’t stopping her! But 
then why should she be stopped? 
After all, she was seventeen, plenty 
old enough to do anything she 
wanted. Kids grew up faster these 
days than they did in Mom’s 
time, though parents didn’t seem 
to realize it. 

Parents didn’t realize very 
much. They just wanted to sit 
around and plan out new acres for 
the farm. Their idea of fun was 
to listen to some old classic re- 
cording, a bop piece or a rock ’n’ 
roll, and follow the music with 
scores and talk about how free and 
expressionistic their youth had 
been. And sometimes they’d go 
through big, glossy art books filled 
with reproductions of 20th-century 
comic strips and talk about the 
lost art of satire. 

Their idea of a really Big Night 
was to go down to the gallery and 
stare reverently at the collection 
of Saturday Evening Post covers 
from the Great Period. But all 
that longhair stuff bored her. Nuts 
to art — she liked the sensories. 

A DJUSTING her face mask 
and respirator, Mariner-Blaine 
put on her flippers and turned the 
valve. In a few seconds, the lock 
was filled with water. Impatiently 
she waited until the pressure had 



174 



GALAXY 




equalized with the water outside. 
Then the lock opened automati- 
cally and she shot out 

Her dad’s pressure farm was at 
the hundred-foot level, not far 
from the mammoth underwater 
bulk of Hawaii. She turned down- 
ward, descending into the green 
gloom with quick, powerful strokes. 
Hal would be waiting for her at 
the coral caves. 

The darkness grew as Mariner- 
Blaine descended. She switched 
on her headlamp and took a firmer 
bite on her respirator. Was it true, 
she wondered, that soon the under- 
sea farmers would be able to grow 
their own gills? That’s what her 
science teacher said, and maybe 
it would happen in her own life- 
time. How would she look with 
gills? Mysterious, probably, sleek 
and strange, a latter-day mermaid. 

Besides, she could always cover 
the gills with her hair if they 
weren’t becoming. 

In the yellow glow of her lamp, 
she saw the coral caves ahead, a 
red and pink branched labyrinth 
with cozy, air-locked places deep 
within, where you could be sure 
of privacy. And she saw Hal. 

Uncertainty flooded her. Gosh, 
what if she had a baby? Hal had 
assured her it would be all right, 
but he was only nineteen. Was she 
right in doing this? They had 
talked about it often enough and 
she had shocked him with her 
frankness. But talking and doing 



were very different things. What 
would Hal think of her if she said 
no? Could she make a joke out 
of it, pretend she’d just been teas- 
ing him? 

Long and golden, Hal swam be- 
side her toward the caves. He 
flashed hello in finger talk. A 
trigger-fish swam by, and then a 
small shark. 

What was she going to do? The 
caves were very near, looming 
dark and suggestive before them. 
Hal looked at her and she could 
feel her heart melting . 

'C' LGIN-Blaine sat upright, re- 
^ alizing that he must have 
dozed off. He was aboard a small 
motor vessel, sitting in a deck 
chair with blankets tucked around 
him. The little ship rolled and 
pitched in the cross-sea, but over- 
head the sun was brilliant, and the 
trade wind carried the diesel 
smoke away in a wide dark plume. 

‘‘You feeling better, Mr. Elgin?” 

Elgin-Blaine looked up at a 
small, bearded man wearing a cap- 
tain’s cap. “Fine, just fine,” he said. 

“We’re almost there,” said the 
captain. 

Elgin-Blaine nodded, disori- 
ented, trying to take stock of him- 
self. He thought hard and remem- 
bered that he was shorter than 
average, heavily muscled, barrel- 
chested, broad-shouldered, with 
legs a little short for such a her- 
culean torso, with large and cal-

loused hands. There was an old, 
jagged scar on his shoulder, sou- 
venir of a hunting accident . 

Elgin and Blaine merged. 

Then he realized that he was 
back at last in his own body. 
Blaine was his name, and Elgin 
was the pseudonym under which 
Carl Ore and Joe must have 
shipped him. 

The long flight was over! His 
mind and his body were together 
again! 

“We were told you weren’t well, 
sir,” the captain said. “But you’ve 
been in this coma for so long — * 

“I’m fine now,” Blaine assured 
him. “Are we anywhere near the 
Marquesas?” 

“Not far. The island of Nuku 
Hiva is just a few hours away.” 

The captain returned to his 
wheelhouse. And Blaine thought 
about the many personalities he 
had met and mingled with. 

He respected the staunch and 
independent old Dyersen walking 
slowly back to his cottage, hoped 
young Sandy Thompson would re- 
turn to Mars, felt alarm for the 
warped and murderous Piggot, en- 
joyed his meeting with the serious 
and upright Juan Ramirez, felt 
mingled sorrow and amusement 
for the sly and ineffectual Ed 
Tyler, wished for the best for 
pretty Janice Mariner. 

They were with him still. Good 
or bad, he wished them all well. 
They were his family now. Distant 



relatives, cousins and uncles he 
would never meet again, nieces 
and nephews upon whose destiny 
he would brood. 

Like all families, they were a 
mixed lot; but they were his, and 
he could never forget them. 

“Nuku Hiva in sight!” the cap- 
tain called out. 

Blaine saw, on the edge of the 
horizon, a tiny black dot capped 
by a white cumulus cloud. He 
rubbed his forehead vigorously, de- 
termined to think no more about 
his adopted family. There were 
present realities to deal with. Soon 
he would be coming to his new 
home, and that required a little 
serious thinking. 

29 . 

T HE ship steamed slowly into 
Taio Hae Bay. The captain, a 
proud native son, volunteered to 
Blaine the principal facts about his 
new home. 

The Marquesas Islands, he ex- 
plained, were composed of two 
fairly distinct island groups, all of 
them rugged and mountainous. 
Once the group had been called 
the Cannibal Islands, and the Mar- 
quesas had been noted for their 
ability at cutting out a trading ship 
or massacring a blackbirding 
schooner. The French had ac- 
quired the islands in 1842 and 
granted them autonomy in 1993. 
Nuku Hiva was the main island 



178 



GALAXY 




and capital for the group. Its high- 
est peak, Temetiu, was nearly four 
thousand feet high. Its port city, 
Taiohae, boasted a population of 
almost five thousand. 

It was a quiet, easygoing place, 
the captain said, and it was con- 
sidered a sort of shrine all over 
the hurried, bustling South Seas. 
For here was the last refuge of 
unspoiled 20th-century Polynesia. 

Blaine nodded, absorbing little 
of the captain's lecture, more im- 
pressed by the sight of the great 
dark mountain ahead laced with 
silver waterfalls, and by the sound 
of the ocean pounding against the 
island’s granite face. 

He decided he was going to like 
it here. 

Soon the ship was docked at the 
town wharf and Blaine stepped off 
to view the town of Taiohae. 

He saw a supermarket and three 
movie theaters, rows of ranch- 
style houses, many palm trees, 
some low white stores with 
plate-glass windows, numerous 
cocktail lounges, dozens of auto- 
mobiles, a gas station and a traffic 
light The sidewalks were filled 
with people wearing colorful shirts 
and pressed slacks. All had on sun- 
glasses. 

So this was the last refuge of 
unspoiled 20th-century Polynesia, 
Blaine thought — a Florida town 
set in the South Seas! 

Still, what more could he expect 
in the year 2110? Ancient Poly- 



nesia was as dead as Merrie Eng- 
land or Bourbon France. And 
20th-century Florida, he remem- 
bered, could be pleasant indeed. 

He walked down Main Street 
and saw a notice on a building 
stating that Postmaster Alfred 
Gray had been appointed Here- 
after, Inc., representative for the 
Marquesas group. And, farther on, 
he came to a small black building 
with a sign on it that said Public 
Suicide Booth. 

Ah, Blaine thought sardonically, 
modern civilization is encroaching 
even here! Next thing you know, 
they’ll be setting up a Spiritual 
Switchboard. And where will we 
be then? 

TTE had reached the end of 
town. As he started back, a 
stout, red-faced man hurried up to 
him. 

“Mr. Elgin? Mr. Thomas El- 
gin?” 

“That's me,” Blaine said, with a 
start of apprehension. 

“Terribly sorry I missed you at 
the dock,” said the red-faced man, 
mopping his wide and gleaming 
forehead with a bandanna. “No ex- 
cuse, of course. Sheer oversight on 
my part. The languor of the 
islands. Inevitable after a while. 
I’m Davis, owner of the Point 
Boatyard. Welcome to Taiohae, 
Mr. Elgin.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Davis,” Blaine 
said.

“On the contrary, I want to 
thank you again for answering my 
advertisement,” Davis replied. 
“I’ve been needing a master boat- 
wright for months. You have no 
idea! And frankly, I didn’t expect 
to attract a man of your qualifi- 
cations.” 

“Ummm,” said Blaine, surprised 
and pleased at the thoroughness of 
Carl Ore’s preparations. 

“Not many men around with a 
grounding in 20th-century boat- 
building methods,” Davis said 
sadly. “Lost art. Have you had a 
look around the island?” 

“Just very briefly,” said Blaine. 
“Think you’ll want to stay?” 
Davis asked anxiously. “You have 
no idea how hard it is getting a 
good boatwright to settle down in 
a quiet little backwater like this. 
No sooner do they get here than 
they want to go charging off to 
the big booming cities like Pa- 
peete or Apia. I know wages are 
higher in places like that, and 
there’s more amusements and so- 
ciety and things, but Taiohae has 
a charm of its own.” 

“I’ve had my fill of the cities,” 
Blaine said, smiling. “I’m not likely 
to go charging off, Mr. Davis.” 
“Good, good! Don’t bother com- 
ing to work for a few days, Mr. 
Elgin. Rest, take it easy, look 
around our island. It’s the last ref- 
uge of primitive Polynesia, you 
know. Here are the keys to your 
house. Number one Temetiu Road, 



straight up the mountain there. 
Shall I show you the way?” 

“I’ll find it,” Blaine said. “Thanks 
very much, Mr. Davis.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Elgin. I’ll 
drop in on you tomorrow, after 
you’re a bit more settled. Then you 
can meet some of our townfolk. In 
fact, the mayor’s wife is giving a 
party Thursday. Or is it Friday? 
Anyhow, I’ll find out and let you 
know.” 

They shook hands and Blaine 
started up Temetiu Road, to his 
new home. 

It was a small, freshly painted 
bungalow with a spectacular view 
of Nuku Hiva’s three southern 
bays. Blaine admired the sight for 
a few minutes, then tried the door. 
It was unlocked and he walked 
in. 

“It’s about time you got here.” 

Blaine just stared, not able to 
believe what he saw. 

“Marie!” 

CHE appeared as slim, lovely 
^ and cool as ever. But she was 
nervous. She talked swiftly and 
avoided meeting his eyes. 

“I thought it would be best if I 
made the final arrangements on 
the spot,” she said. “I’ve been here 
for two days, waiting for you. 
You’ve met Mr. Davis, haven’t 
you? He seems like a very nice 
little man.” 

“Marie — ” 

“I told him I was your fiancee,” 
GALAXY 



180 




she continued hurriedly. “I hope 
you don’t mind, Tom. I had to 
have some excuse for being here. 
I said I had come out early to 
surprise you. Mr. Davis was de- 
lighted, of course — he wants so 
badly to have his master boat- 
wright settle here permanently. 
Do you mind, Tom? We can al- 
ways say we broke off the en- 
gagement and — ” 

Blaine took her in his arms and 
said, “I don’t want to break off 
the engagement. I love you, 
Marie.” 

She clung to him fiercely for a 
moment, abruptly stepped back. 
“Then we’d better arrange for a 
marriage ceremony soon, if you 
don’t mind. They’re _ very stuffy 
and small-townish here — very 
20th-century, if you know what I 
mean.” 

“I think I know what you 
mean,” Blaine said. 

They looked at each other and 
burst out laughing. 

30. 

M ARIE insisted upon staying 
at the South Seas Motel 
until a wedding could be arranged. 
Blaine suggested a quiet ceremony 
before a justice of the peace, but 
Marie surprised him by wanting 
as large a wedding as Taiohae 
could produce. It was held on Sun- 
day at the mayor’s house. 

Mr. Davis loaned them a little 



cutter from the boatyard. They 
set sail at sunrise for a honey- 
moon cruise to Tahiti. 

For Blaine, it had the sensation 
of a delicious and fleeting dream. 
They sailed across a sea carved of 
green jade and saw the moon, yel- 
low and swollen, quartered by the 
cutter’s shrouds and tangled in its 
stays. The sun rose out of a long 
black cloud, reached its zenith 
and declined, scouring the sea into 
a gleaming bowl' of brass. 

They anchored in the lagoon at 
Papeete and saw the mountains 
of Moorea flaming in the sunset, 
more fantastic than the Lunar 
mountains. And Blaine remem- 
bered a day on the Chesapeake 
when he had dreamed, Ah, Raia- 
tea, the Mountains of Moorea, the 
fresh trade wind . 

A continent and an ocean had 
separated him from Tahiti, and 
other obstacles besides. But that 
had been in another century. 

They would have spent more 
time in Papeete, but as they 
walked down the waterfront, they 
saw three zombies crouching in 
the shade with begging bowls. The 
zombies stared as they passed, 
then followed them. Blaine gave 
them alms, but the zombies still 
followed, mute and reproachful. 

Finally Blaine stopped, turned 
and said, “All right. What do you 
want?” 

The zombies didn’t answer. 
They simply shook their heads 



TIME KILLER 



181 




and stared at his strong wrestler’s 
body, 

“Is it because of Smith?” Blaine 
shouted at them. 

Their eyes glowed when they 
heard the name, but they refused 
to reply. 

“Let’s get out of here,” Marie 
said. “The damned zombies have 
a worldwide organization. They 
probably know all about you and 
Smith.” 

Blaine and Marie went to 
Moorea, rode horses up the slopes 
and picked the white tiare Tahiti. 
But they came across a single 
frail and withered old zombie who 
watched them intently with re- 
proachful eyes. And when Blaine 
asked him about Smith, the zom- 
bie nodded briefly. 

They returned to their boat an- 
chored in the bay below and set 
sail for the Tuamotos. 

But there was no escaping from 
the silent, passive persecution of 
the zombies. On Atua, ten zombies 
came to the dockside and stood in 
a long line by the boat. Blaine 
walked out with a machinist’s ham- 
mer in his hand, looking for trou- 
ble, hoping the zombies would 
attack him. He wanted something 
solid to fight against. But the zom- 
bies simply stared. They appeared 
as fragile as withered leaves, ten 
dry husks that a child could scat- 
ter, as helpless as scarecrows. But 
they were invulnerable in their 
helplessness, as strong as death. 



Blaine put the hammer back in 
his pocket and returned to the 
boat. 

The zombie network had spread 
word of Blaine even to the tiniest 
atolls. Sometimes singly, some- 
times in groups, the zombies 
gathered wherever Blaine landed. 
The silent chorus watched his 
movements with great, dying, re- 
proachful eyes; the powerless, in- 
vulnerable furies waited with a 
terrible, soul-destroying patience. 
And Blaine knew what they were 
waiting for. 

Blaine and Marie sailed back to 
Taiohae. Marie started housekeep- 
ing. Blaine began to work at the 
boatyard, and waited. 

T>LAINE’S job at the boatyard 
* * was interesting and varied. 
The island cutters and ketches 
limped in with bent shafts or 
nicked propellers, with planks that 
had been splintered against a hid- 
den coral head, with sails blown 
out by a sudden gale. There were 
underwater craft to be serviced, 
boats belonging to the nearby un- 
dersea pressure farms that used 
Taiohae as a supply base. And 
there were dinghies to build, and 
an occasional schooner. 

Blaine handled all practical de- 
tails with skill and dispatch. As 
time went by, he started to write 
a few publicity releases about the 
yard for the South Seas Courier. 
This brought in more business, 



182 



GALAXY 




which involved more paperwork 
and a greater need for liaison be- 
tween the Point Boatyard and the 
small yards to which it farmed out 
work. Blaine handled this, and 
took over advertising as well. 

His job as master boatwright 
came to bear an uncanny resem- 
blance to his past jobs as junior 
yacht designer. 

But this no longer bothered him. 
It seemed obvious to him now that 
nature had intended him to be a 
junior yacht designer, nothing 
more nor less. This was his destiny 
and he accepted it. 

His life fell into a pleasant rou- 
tine built around the boatyard and 
the white bungalow, filled with 
Saturday night movies and the 
microfilm Sunday Times, quick 
visits to the undersea farms and to 
other islands in the Marquesas 
Group, parties at the mayor’s 
house and poker at the yacht club, 
brisk sails across Comptroller Bay 
and moonlight swimming on 
Temuoa Beach. 

And, through it all, the zombies 
of Taiohae stayed close, and 
watched him, and waited. 

One morning at the boatyard, 
Mr. Davis came over with a wor- 
ried frown. 

“Say, Tom, there was a fellow 
around here just a little while ago 
looking for you.” 

“Who was it?” asked Blaine. 

“A mainlander,” Davis said. 
“Just off the steamer this morning. 



I told him you weren’t here yet 
and he said he’d see you at your 
house.” 

“What did he look like?” Blaine 
asked, feeling his stomach muscles 
tighten. 

Davis frowned more deeply. 
‘Well, that’s the funny part of it. 
He was about your height, thin, 
very tanned. He wore some kind 
of surgical mask, but the skin 
didn’t look right And he stank of 
chlorophyll ” 

“Sounds peculiar,” Blaine said. 

“Very peculiar. And he limped 
pretty bad.” 

“Did he leave a name?” 

“Said his name was Smith. Tom, 
where are you going?” 

“I have to go home right now,” 
Blaine said. “I’ll try to explain 
later.” 

He hurried away. Smith must 
have found out his own identity 
and what the connection was be- 
tween himself and Blaine. And, 
exactly as he had promised, the 
zombie had come visiting. 

31. 

TITTHEN he told Marie, she went 
" ’ at once to a closet and took 
down their suitcases. She carried 
them into the bedroom and began 
flinging clothes into them. 

“What are you doing?” Blaine 
asked. 

“Packing.” 

“So I see. But why?” 



TIME KILLER 



183 




“Because we’re getting out of 
here.” 

“What are you talking about? 
We live here!” 

“Not any more,” she said. “Not 
with that damned Smith around. 
Tom, he means trouble.” 

“I’m sure he does,” said Blaine. 
“But that’s no reason to run. Stop 
packing a minute and listen! What 
do you think he can do to me?” 
“We’re not going to stay and 
find out,” she said. 

She continued to shove clothes 
into the suitcase until Blaine 
grabbed her wrists. 

“Calm down,” he told her. “I’m 
not going to run from Smith.” 
“But it’s the only sensible thing 
to do,” Marie said. “He’s trouble, 
but he can’t live much longer. Just 
a few more months, weeks maybe, 
and he’ll be dead. He should have 
died long before now, that horrible 
zombie! Tom, let’s go!” 

“Have you gone crazy or some- 
thing?” Blaine demanded. “What- 
ever he wants, I can handle it.” 
“I’ve heard you say that be- 
fore,” Marie said. 

“Things were different then.” 
“They’re different now! Tom, 
we could borrow the cutter again — 
Mr. Davis would understand — 
and we could go to — ” 

“No! I’m damned if I’ll run 
from him! Maybe you’ve forgotten, 
Marie, Smith saved my life.” 

“But what did he save it for?” 
she wailed. “Tom, I’m warning 



you! You mustn’t see him, not u 
he remembers!” 

“Wait a minute,” Blaine said 
slowly. “Is there something you 
know? Something I don’t?” 

She immediately grew calm. “Of 
course not.” 

“Marie, are you telling me the 
truth?” 

“Yes, darling. But I’m fright- 
ened of Smith. Please, Tom, hu- 
mor me this once — let’s go away.” 
“I won’t run another step from 
anyone,” Blaine said. “I live here. 
And that’s the end of it.” 

Marie sat down, looking sud- 
denly exhausted. “All right, dear. 
Do what you think is best.” 

“That’s better,” said Blaine. 
“It’ll turn out all right.” 

“Of course it will,” Marie said. 
Blaine put the suitcases back 
and hung up the clothes. Then he 
sat down to wait. He was physi- 
cally calm. But in memory he had 
returned to the underground, had 
passed again through the ornate 
door covered with Egyptian hier- 
oglyphics and Chinese ideographs, 
into the vast marble-pillared Pal- 
ace of Death with its gold and 
bronze coffin. And he heard again 
Reilly’s screaming voice speak 
through a silvery mist: 

“There are things you can’t see, 
Blaine, but I see them. Your time 
on Earth will be short, very short, 
painfully short. Those you trust 
will betray you. Those you hate 
will conquer you. You will die, 



184 



GALAXY 




Blaine, not in years but sooi. 
sooner than you could believe. 
You’ll be betrayed, and you’ll die 
by your own hand.” 

That mad old man! Blaine 
shivered slightly and looked at 
Marie. She sat with downcast eyes, 
waiting. So he waited, too. 

After a while there was a soft 
knock at the door. 

“Come in,” Blaine said to who- 
ever was outside. 

32. 

TJLAINE recognized Smith im- 
mediately, even with the tan 
surgical mask. The zombie came 
in, limping, bringing with him a 
faint odor of decay imperfectly 
masked by a powerful chlorophyll 
deodorant. 

“Excuse the disguise,” Smith 
said. “It isn’t intended to deceive 
you or anyone else. I wear it be- 
cause my face is no longer pre- 
sentable.” 

“You’ve come a long way,” said 
Blaine. 

“Yes, quite far,” Smith agreed, 
“and through difficulties I won’t 
bore you by relating. But I got 
here. That’s the important thing.” 

“Why did you come?” 

“Because I know who I am,” 
Smith answered. 

“And you think it concerns 
me?” 

“Yes.” 

“I can’t imagine how,” Blaine 



said grimly. “But let’s hear it” 

Marie said, “Wait a minute. 
Smith, you’ve been after him since 
he came into this world. He’s never 
had a moment’s peace. Can’t you 
accept things as they are? Can’t 
you just go and die quietly some- 
where?” 

“Not without telling him first,” 
Smith said. 

“Come on, let’s hear it,” said 
Blaine. 

Smith said, “My name is James 
Olin Robinson.” 

“Never heard of you,” Blaine 
replied after a moment’s thought. 

“Of course not.” 

“Have we ever met before that 
time in the Rex Building?” 

“Not formally.” 

“But we met?” 

“Briefly.” 

“All right, James Olin Robin- 
son, tell me about it. When did 
we meet?” 

“It was quite brief,” Robinson 
said. “We glimpsed each other for 
a fraction of a second, then saw 
no more. It happened late one 
night in 1958, on a lonely high- 
way, you in your car and me in 
mine.” 

“You were driving the car I had 
the accident with?” 

“Yes. If you can call it an acci- 
dent.” 

“But it was! It was completely 
accidental!” 

“If that’s true, I have no further 
business here,” Robinson said. 



TIME KILLER

“But, Blaine, I know it was not an 
accident. It was murder. Ask your 
wife.” 

TTE looked at his wife sitting in 
a comer of the couch. Marie’s 
face was waxen. Her gaze seemed 
to turn inward and not enjoy what 
it saw there. Blaine wondered if 
she was staring at the ghost of 
some ancient guilt, long buried, 
long quickening, now come to term 
with the appearance of the zombie 
Robinson. 

Watching her, he slowly began 
piecing things together. 

“Marie,” he said, “what about 
that night in 1958? How did you 
know that Robinson and I were 
going to have an accident? 

She said, “There are statistical 
prediction methods we use, val- 
ence factors . Her voice trailed 
away. 

“Or did you make us have the 
accident?” Blaine asked. 

Marie didn’t answer. And Blaine 
thought hard about the manner of 
his dying. 

He had been driving over a 
straight, empty highway, his head- 
lights probing ahead, the darkness 
receding endlessly before him . 
His car swerved freakishly, vio- 
lently, toward the oncoming head- 
lights . He twisted hard on the 
steering wheel. It wouldn’t turn . 
The steering wheel came free and 
spun in his hands, and the engine 
wailed . 



“By God, you made us have that 
accident!” Blaine shouted at his 
wife. “You and Rex Power Sys- 
tems — you forced my car into a 
swerve! Look at me and answer! 
Isn’t it true?” 

“All right!” she said. “But I 
didn’t mean to kill you. It was 
Robinson we were after. He’s the 
man your present body was in- 
tended for, Tom. In 1958 he was 
a liberal religious leader. Rex 
decided to snatch him, show him 
the scientific hereafter, the Thresh- 
old, reincarnation. We thought 
he’d endorse Rex. We could make 
a breach in the organized religions 
by using Robinson. But the cali- 
bration was off and we got you in- 
stead. And Robinson took over 
Reilly’s body.” 

Blaine said, “You’ve known all 
along who he was.” 

“I’ve suspected.” 

“And never told me.” 

“I couldn’t, Tom, I just couldn’t 
All right, it was wrong. I tried to 
make it up. I smuggled your re- 
cording to the religions. I helped 
you, watched out for you—” 

“But you didn’t help me,” Rob- 
inson said. 

YV/^ITH an effort, Marie turned 
** and looked at him. “I’m afraid 
I was responsible for your death, 
Mr. Robinson. When the cars 
came together, your body must 
have died at the same time as 
Tom’s. The Rex Power System 



186 



GALAXY 




that snatched him into 2110 
pulled you along, too. Then you 
took over Reilly’s body. It’s 
worked out horribly, but we had 
no idea that all this would hap- 
pen. We thought you’d appreciate 
being brought into the future and 
receiving actual assurance of a life 
after death. If the experiment had 
turned out right—” 

“But it didn’t,” Robinson broke 
in. “And you have given me a 
very poor exchange for my former 
body and my former life.” 

“I know. But what can I do? 
The hereafter—” 

“I don’t want it yet,” Robinson 
said. “I was a married man with 
children when you killed me. I 
had a mission in life. That mis- 
sion must be fulfilled, my life lived 
out as it was meant to.” 

“But how?” she asked desper- 
ately. 

Robinson hesitated a moment, 
then said, “I want a body. I want 
a man’s good body that I can live 
in, not this decaying thing that I 
drag about. Blaine, your wife killed 
my former body.” 

Blaine said, “And now you want 
mine?” 

“If you think it’s fair,” Robinson 
said. 

“Now wait just a minute!” 
Marie cried. 

Color had returned to her face. 
With her confession, she seemed 
to have freed herself from the grip 
of the guilt in her mind. 



“Robinson,” she said, “you can’t 
ask that from him. He didn’t have 
anything to do with your death. 
What’s done is done! Get out of 
here!” 

Robinson ignored her and 
looked at Blaine. “I always knew 
it was you, Blaine. When I knew 
nothing else, I knew it was you. I 
watched over you, Blaine. I saved 
your life.” 

“Yes, you did,” Blaine said 
quietly. 

“So what?” Marie screamed. “So 
he saved your life. That doesn’t 
mean he owns it! One doesn’t save 
a life and expect it to be forfeited 
upon request. Tom, don’t listen to 
him!” 

Robinson said, “I have no means 
or intention of forcing you, Blaine. 
You will decide what you think 
is right and I will abide by it. And 
you will remember everything .” 

Blaine looked at the zombie al- 
most with affection. “So there’s 
more to it. Much more. Isn’t there, 
Robinson?” 

Robinson nodded, his eyes fixed 
on Blaine’s face. 

“But how did you know?” 
Blaine asked. “How could you 
possibly know?” 

“My life has revolved around 
you. I’ve thought about nothing 
but you. And the better I knew 
you, Blaine, the more certain I 
was about this.” 

“Perhaps,” Blaine admitted. 

Marie said, “What on Earth are 



TIME KILLER 



187 




you talking about? What more? 
What more could there be?” 

“I have to think about this,” said 
Blaine, his gaze distant. “I have 
to remember. Robinson, please 
wait outside for a little while.” 
“Certainly,” the zombie said, 
and left immediately. 

Without even glancing at Marie, 
Blaine sat down and held his head 
in his hands. Now he had to re- 
member something he would 
rather not think about. Now, once 
and for all, he had to trace it back 
and understand it 

Etched sharp and raw in his 
mind still were the words Reilly 
had screamed at him in the Palace 
of Death: “You're responsible! 

You killed me with your evil mur- 
dering mind! Yes, you, you hideous 
thing from the past, you damned 
monster! Everything shuns you ex- 
cept your friend the dead man! 
Why aren’t you dead, you mur- 
derer?” 

Had Reilly known? 

Blaine remembered Sammy 
Jones saying to him after the hunt : 
“Tom, you’re a natural-born killer. 
There’s nothing else for you.” 

Had Sammy guessed? 

And now the most important 
thing of all, that most significant 
moment of his life— the time of his 
death on a night in 1958. Vividly 
he remembered: 

The steering wheel was working 
again, but Blaine ignored it, filled 
with a sudden fierce exultancy, a 



lightning switch of mood that wel- 
comed the smash, lusted for it, 
and lor pain and cruelty and 
death . 

Blaine shuddered convulsively 
as he relived the moment he had 
wanted to forget — the moment 
when he might have avoided catas- 
trophe, but had preferred to kill. 

He lifted his head and looked at 
his wife. He said, “I killed him. 
That’s what Robinson knew. And 
now I know it, too.” 

33. 

C AREFULLY he explained it 
all to Marie. She refused at 
first to believe him. 

“It was so far back, Tom! How 
can you be sure of what hap- 
pened?” 

“I’m sure,” Blaine said. “I don't 
think any person could forget the 
way he died. I remember every 
detail of my death. That was how 
I died.” 

“Still, you can’t call yourself a 
murderer because of one instant, 
one fraction of a second—” 

“How long does it take to shoot 
a bullet or to drive in a knife?” 
Blaine asked. “A fraction of a sec- 
ond! That’s how long it takes to 
become a murderer.” 

“But, Tom, you had no motive!” 
Blaine shook his head. “It’s true 
that I didn’t kill for gain or re- 
venge. But then I’m not that kind 
of murderer. I’m the grass-roots

GALAXY 




variety, the ordinary average guy 
with a little of everything in his 
makeup, including murder. I 
killed because, in that moment, I 
had the opportunity. My special 
opportunity, a unique interlock- 
ing of events, moods, train of 
thought, humidity, temperature, 
and Lord knows what else.” 

“But you’re not to blame!” Marie 
said. “It would never have hap- 
pened if Rex Power Systems and 
I hadn’t created that special op- 
portunity for you.” 

“Yes, but I seized the oppor- 
tunity,” said Blaine, “seized it and 
performed a cold-blooded murder 
just for fun, because I knew I 
could never be caught at it. My 
murder.” 

“Our murder,” she said. 

“Yes.” 

“All right, we're murderers,” 
Marie said calmly. “Accept it, 
Tom. Don’t get mushy-minded 
about it We’ve killed once. We 
can kill again.” 

“Never,” said Blaine. 

“He’s almost finished! I swear 
to you, Tom, there’s not a month 
of life in him. One blow and he’s 
done for. One push.” 

“I’m not that kind of mur- 
derer.” 

“Will you let me do it?” 

“I’m not that kind, either.” 
“You idiot! Then just do noth- 
ing! Wait. A month, no more than 
that, and he’s finished. You can 
wait a month, Tom—” 



“More murder,” Blaine said 
wearily. 

“Tom! You’re not going to give 
him your body! What about our 
life together?” 

“Do you think we could go on 
after this?” Blaine asked. “I 
couldn’t. Now stop arguing with 
me._I don’t know whether I’d do 
this if there weren’t a hereafter. 
Quite probably I wouldn’t But 
there is a hereafter. I’d like to go 
there with my accounts as straight 
as possible, all bills paid in full, 
all restitutions made. If this were 
my only existence, I'd cling to it 
with everything I’ve got. But it 
isn’t! Can you understand that?” 

“Yes, of course,” Marie said un- 
happily. 

“Frankly, I’m getting pretty cu- 
rious about this afterlife. I want 
to see it. And there’s one thing 
more.” 

“What’s that?” 

Tl/T ARIE’S shoulders were trem- 
lTJ. bling, so Blaine put his arm 
around her. He was thinking back 
to the conversation he had had 
with Hull, the elegant and aristo- 
cratic Quarry. 

Hull had said: “We follow 

Nietzsche’s dictum — to die at the 
right time! Intelligent people don’t 
clutch at the last shreds of life like 
drowning men clinging to a bit of 
board. They know that the body’s 
life is only an infinitesimal por- 
tion of Man’s total existence. Why

shouldn’t those bright pupils skip 
a grade or two of school?” 

Blaine remembered how strange, 
dark, atavistic and noble Hull’s 
lordly selection of death had 
seemed. Pretentious, of course, but 
then life itself was a pretension in 
the vast universe of unliving mat- 
ter. Hull had seemed like an an- 
cient Japanese nobleman kneeling 
to perform the ceremonial act of 
hara-kiri, and emphasizing the im- 
portance of life in the very selec- 
tion of death. 

And Hull had said: “The deed 
of dying transcends class and 
breeding. It is every man’s patent 
of nobility, his summons from the 
king, his knightly adventure. And 
how he acquits himself in that 
lonely and perilous enterprise is 
his true measure as a man.” 

Marie broke into his reverie, 
asking, “What was that one thing 
more?” 

“Oh.” Blaine thought for a mo- 
ment “I just wanted to say that 
I guess some of the attitudes of the 
22nd century have rubbed off on 
me. Especially the aristocratic 
ones.” He grinned and kissed her. 
“But, of course, I always did have 
good taste.” 

34. 

T> LAINE opened the door of the 
cottage. “Robinson,” he said, 
“come with me to the Suicide 
Booth. I’m giving you my body.”

“I expected no less of you, 
Tom,” the zombie said. 

Together they went slowly down 
the mountainside. Marie watched 
them from a window for a few sec- 
onds, then started down after 
them. 

They stopped at the door to 
the Suicide Booth. Blaine said, 
“Do you think you can take over 
all right?” 

“I’m sure of it,” said Robin- 
son. “Tom, I'm grateful for this. 
I'll use your body well.” 

“It’s not mine, really,” Blaine 
said. “Belonged to a fellow named 
Kranch. But I’ve grown fond of it. 
You’ll get used to its habits. Just 
remind it once in a while who’s 
boss. Sometimes it wants to go 
hunting.” 

Marie came up and kissed 
Blaine good-by with cold lips. 
Blaine said, “What will you do?” 

She shrugged her shoulders. “Go 
back to New York, I suppose.” 

“That’s probably best,” Blaine 
agreed. 

He looked around once more 
at the palm trees whispering un- 
der the sun, the blue expanse of 
the sea, and the great dark moun- 
tain above him cut with silver 
waterfalls. Then he turned and 
entered the Suicide Booth and 
closed the door behind him. 

There were no windows, no fur- 
niture except a single chair. The 
instructions posted on one wall 
were very simple. You just sat 



down and, at your leisure, closed 
the switch upon the right arm. You 
would then die, quickly and pain- 
lessly, and your body would be 
left intact. 

He thought again about the first 
time he died and wished it had 
been more interesting. By rights 
he should have rectified the error 
this time and gone down like Hull, 
hunted fiercely 'across a mountain 
ledge at sundown. Why couldn't it 
have been like that? Why couldn’t 
death have come while he was 
battling a typhoon, meeting a 
tiger’s charge, or climbing Mount 
Everest? Why, for the second time, 
would his death be so tame, so 
commonplace, so ordinary? 

But then why had he never real- 
ly designed yachts? 

A N enterprising death, he real- 
ized again, would be out of 
character for him. Undoubtedly 
he was meant to die in just this 
quick, commonplace, painless way. 
And all his life in the future must 
have gone into the forming and 
shaping of this death — a vague in- 
dication when Reilly died, a fair 
certainty in the Palace of Death, 
an implacable destiny when he 
settled in Taiohae. 

Still, no matter how ordinary, 
one’s death is the most interesting 
event of one’s life. Blaine looked 
forward eagerly to his. 

He had no complaint to make. 
Although he had lived in the fu- 



192 



GALAXY 




ture little over a year, he had 
gained its greatest prize — the 
hereafter. 

He felt again what he had ex- 
perienced after leaving the Here- 
after Building — release from the 
heavy, sodden, constant, uncon- 
scious fear of death that subtly 
weighed every action and per- 
meated every movement. No man 
of his own century could live with- 
out the shadow that crept down 
the corridors of his mind like some 
grisly tapeworm, the ghost that 
haunted nights and days, the 
croucher behind comers, the shape 
behind doors, the unseen guest at 
every banquet, the unidentified fig- 
ure in every landscape, always 
present, always waiting— 

No more! 

For now the ancient enemy was 
defeated. And men no longer died; 
they moved on! 

But he had gained even more 
than an afterlife. He had managed 
to squeeze and compress an en- 
tire lifetime into that year. 

He had been bom in a white 
room with dazzling lights and a 
doctor’s bearded face above him, 
and a motherly nurse to feed him 
while he listened, alarmed, to the 
babble of strange tongues. He had 
ventured early into the world, 
raw and uneducated, and had 
stared at the oriental marvel of 
New York, and allowed a straight- 
eyed fast-talking stranger to make 
a fool and nearly a corpse of him, 



until wiser heads rescued him 
from his folly and soothed his pain. 

Clothed in his fine, strong, 
hearty body, he had ventured out 
again, wiser this time, and had 
moved as an equal among men 
equipped with glittering weapons 
in the pursuit of danger and honor. 
And he had lived through that 
folly too, and, still older, had 
chosen an honorable occupation. 
But certain dark omens present at 
his birth finally reached fruition, 
and he had to flee his homeland 
and run to the farthest comer of 
the Earth. 

Yet he still managed to acquire 
a family on the way, a family with 
certain skeletons in the closet, but 
his all the same. 

In the fullness of manhood, he 
had come to a land he loved, taken 
a wife, and, on his honeymoon, 
seen the mountains of Moorea 
flaming in the sunset. He had set- 
tled down to spend his declining 
months in peace and useful labor, 
and in fond recollection of the 
wonders he had seen. And so he 
had spent them, honored and re- 
spected by all. 

It was sufficient. 

Blaine turned the switch. 

35 . 

TVTEW York was cold and win- 

’ tery and a high wind howled 
down the avenues. Marie walked 
to a large graystone building near

Third Avenue. Engraved above 
the door was the statement: “Dedi- 
cated to Free Communication Be- 
tween Those on Earth and Those 
Beyond.” 

She entered the Spiritual 
Switchboard, walked to the infor- 
mation booth and showed a slip 
of paper. 

“Thafs Messages Incoming,” 
Said the pleasant, gray-haired re- 
ceptionist “Straight down the hall 
to Room 32B.” 

Marie walked down the hall 
and entered a small gray room 
with several armchairs and a loud- 
speaker set in the wall. She waited. 

“Marie!” said a voice from the 
loudspeaker. 

“Tom!” 

“Ifs very good to see you, 
Marie.” 

“But why have you waited so 
long to contact me?” she asked. 
“I thought— I was afraid you hadn’t 
made it.” 

“I reached the Threshold all 
right,” Blaine said. “But I took a 
little while getting oriented.” 

“What is it like?” 

“That’s hard to explain. Ray 
Melhill tried to tell me and I 
didn’t understand what he was 
talking about But I see now. He 
was perfectly right — color really 
is direction, and they’re both prac- 
tically the same as sound. Position 
is what counts, because it’s all a 
question of wholenesses. You see, 
in Threshold you can experience 



a framework and perceive it also. 
But there's no real dissociation. Do 
you understand?” 

“No,” said Marie sadly. 

“Well, you’ll see it yourself some 
day. Tell me, how is Robinson?” 
“He’s fine,” Marie said. “He 
married Alice Kranch, you know.” 
“Oh, I know that. I mean has he 
started getting the religions to- 
gether?” 

“He hasn’t thought about it.” 
“He will.” 

“Tom,” Marie said, “what about 
us? Will we meet again?” 

“Yes. Definitely.” 

“But when? Can I— can I come 
now?” 

“No. You’ll know when the time 
is right” 

“But, Tom, what if we’re sepa- 
rated? What will it be like in the 
hereafter? I don’t think I’m going 
to like it. Fm afraid it’s going to 
be terribly strange and ghostly 
and horrible.” 

“You’re wrong,” Blaine told her. 
“I can’t explain it to you, but 
there’s nothing ghostly about it 
We’ll be together, only I can’t ex- 
plain when.” 

“Oh, Tom!” 

“Marie, don’t worry. Fve been 
a junior yacht designer three times 
in two lifetimes. It’s my destiny! 
Surely you don’t think it ends 
here! There’s more, much more!” 
“All right, Tom,” she promised. 
“I’ll wait”
