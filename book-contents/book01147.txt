“Unless you can provide evidence 
that there is definitely, genetically, 
absolutely no difference of intelli- 
gence between black and white and 
between people with different kinds 
of noses — we have no choice but to 
accept the difference as a possibility. 
I am using regular scientific reason- 
ing.” 

The above is from one of the more 
quotable letters I'm still receiving on 
the subject of race and intelligence, 
briefly touched upon here some time 
ago under the headings: Brain 

Pollution (Galaxy, Nov., 19691 and 
Skintelligence (Worlds of IF, Dec., 
19691 Missives that begin: “Who do 
you think you are to--” 1 ignore. 
When, as and if 1 write my auto- 
biography I will do so for money and it 
will be the traditional pack of lies. 
You might enjoy it but I will not do it 
for free. 

But the problem with the “scientific 
reasoning” advanced by Mr. Scott 
Edelstein of Silver Spring, Maryland, 
and cited above is that no rigorously 
scientific definition of intelligence 
exists or has been given general 
acceptance. So that to postulate to- 
day “different kinds” of human intelli- 
gence based on skin color or other 
physiological variations is putting a 
cart before a colt that has yet to be 
foaled. 

That there is a correlation between 
heredity and intelligence — or what 



may be ascertainable about intelli- 
gence — is conceded but imperfectly 
understood by geneticists. And noth- 
ing in the available data suggests 
variations based on race in the kind 
and quality of human intelligence, The 
pertinent genes have not been identi- 
fied among the 10 million or so com- 
prising the human genome — but any 
combination of genes can be found in 
all the races of man. 

Accredited IQ tests do not measure 
intelligence but merely the presumed 
attributes of intelligence in a given 
cultural context e.g. the prestigious 
Stanford-Binet system is designed to 
measure capacity to learn in the Euro- 
American white culture. But a tested 
subject, retested after a lapse of 
several years, may show variations up 
to thirty IQ points without having 
changed his genetic makeup or 
switched races. Genetics only partly 
affect present IQ scoring the rest is 
demonstrably environment. In the 
black-and-white context. Army IQ 
tests have shown Northern blacks out- 
scoring whites from certain Southern 
states on the average. 

More recent studies by Dr. Irwin 
Katz of New York University have 
amassed further evidence that 
environment and motivation dramati- 
cally affect measurable functions of 
what we call intelligence. 

Whatever human intelligence even- 
tually proves to be if it exists at 
all it should in the light of present 
data and needs be considered wealth. 
As such it should be cultivated and 
mined not pursued into what seems 
to be a blind alley of genetic bias.

It was a shot in the 
dark — but on it might 
depend the fate of man!

«iriLL-kill it—” 

^“Look for a patch of white, 
Jake, and fire into it.” 

Yacov HarShawkor found him- 
self in a nightmare when he re- 
turned from the New Delhi con- 
ference. Charles Perry handed him 
a loaded M-16 as they ran. Heavy 
handguns roared around the two 
men. At the lab compound, flood- 
lights flared in useless brilliance. 
Here, in' the dark of the South 
Indian interior plain, there were 
only running feet, harsh cries in 
Tamil and English. “There! Shoot, 
shoot!” and laboring breaths as 
they pursued the escapee from the 
laboratory. 

“What’s white, Charlie? What 
am I aiming at?” 

“Mary’s hospital gown! She got 
out.” 

Yacov came to a full stop, 
clutching the carbine. My god, he 
thought, Mary. A week ago . 
and Charlie expects us to kill her. 
He’s loved her all these years and 
he wants to kill her. For what? Ya- 
cov knew and was cold all through 
with the knowledge. 

“Charlie — ” he yelled at the run- 
ning figure ahead. “You got a 
stable vector for the virus?” 

“Yes, yes,” Charles groaned as 
he slowed, .358 Magnum clutched 
in his right hand. “Yes, and Mary 
has it-- but the process is not 
stable. We have to kill her. Do you 
think I relish it?” 



They stood very close, breath- 
ing with the deep shudders of men 
not often called to sustained 
physical effort. “Yes,” Yacov said 
bitterly. “Yes, I think you do, you 
jealous — ” 

“No. You don’t understand. We 
can’t control the virus in a female. 
That’s not Mary out there. It’s 
the end of the human race.” He 
pointed the handgun. “I’ll kill you, 
too, if I have to; but I’m going to 
burn Mary’s dead body tonight; 
and afterwards I’m going to cre- 
mate the ashes and the dirt where 
she falls.” 

Yacov never knew what might 
have happened as each stood with 
the other’s death in his hand; a 
half-mile ahead of them in the 
black night shots rang out near the 
bank of the broad river. Shouts of 
triumph overlaid a wavering 
scream of pain and terror. In a 
moment the wiry Indian major- 
domo of the great laboratory ran 
back to them. 

“She is dead, gentlemen. Dr. 
Subchundrum is looking for a 
boat to see if the crocodiles have 
left anything. 1 believe I hit her — 
and I know Dr. Subchundrum did. 
1 saw her stagger just before she 
went over the bluff, I am sorry.” 

The searchers at the river 
brought back nothing. For the rest 
of the night three scientists sat in 
the ascetic mess hall of their 
laboratory, passing the station’s 
lone bottle of gin back and forth 
and mourning the loss of Mary

Braden, with whom each had been 
in love at some time and in some 
fashion. 

Memories were traded like snap- 
shots, each serving for a moment 
to hold off from the three the 
actual deadness, the nonexist- 
ence, of the woman whose life had 
been entwined with theirs. The 
mutual magnet which had swept 
them all together as students was a 
consuming interest in the 
mechanics of population control. 
At a great Boston university, 
Patasayjit Subchundrum, Charles 
Perry and Yacov HarShawkor — 
known to his friends as Yankele — 
had made a wheel of intellect and 
adolescent lust revolving around 
Mary Braden’s passionate involve- 
ment in the struggle of heart and 
head for a policy by which 
humanity could live on the planet 
Earth without eating itself. 

A ttending what aii had ex- 
^ pected to be a dreary bore of 
“getting to know your faculty,” 
they met at the home of one Pro- 
fessor Hoogert. 

“Ecological balance,” Hoogert 
said, “is not long denied.” 

He said so to old students and 
new. He said so in class and out of 
it. On this social occasion he said 
so to his four young guests. And 
they accepted the words as the ax- 
iom on which to build their lives. 

“In the generation before mine,” 
Hoogert also said, “your grand- 
parents and great-grandparents 



wore the scar-that-couldn’t-be- 
seen. They all believed hunger-was 
just around the corner. In your 
generation, even Mr. Subchun- 
drum, who comes from a country 
where famine is still real, is some- 
how unmarked by fear. Although 
millions of people have starved in 
India in the last decade, we all feel 
that in some way the problem of 
hunger is going to be solved.” 

Subchundrum, a thin, ravish- 
ingly handsome young hellion 
with a skin the color of sandal- 
wood and the dark brown eyes of a 
fawn, rose to the invitation. 

“Weil, Doctor, famine disturbs 
one more as one approaches be- 
coming a participant in it. For 
people who cannot grow grain and 
cannot get grain and have indeed 
forgotten what grain looks like, it 
is a more gripping experience than 
for a scholar who is living in the 
land of the obese.” 

Dr. Hoogert had grimaced. “I 
don’t feel guilt. I have not chosen 
that any should starve — and no 
mouthful of food I might deny 
myself would add one calorie to 
the diet of a Calcutta slum 
dweller.” 

His wife murmured, “No, but it 
might smooth out that unsightly 
paunch.” She deftly whipped the 
cake plate from her husband’s el- 
bow and placed it in front of the 
young Indian student. 

Mary Braden, hair hanging over 
one eye, spoke then in the diffident 
manner on which girls of her 



TOO MANY PEOPLE

generation relied to disarm 
opponents. “Oh, I see what you 
mean, Mrs. Hoogert — it isn’t our 
personal food intake that helps or 
hurts the starving. But food is so 
important in our society — more 
important than sex, really — that if 
we could just bring ourselves to 
the point of general self-denial we 
might generate a political solution 
to the food problem. Another 
famine might never be allowed in 
India or Brazil.” 

Mrs. Hoogert shot a sharp 
glance at Mary. 

“More important than sex? 
Pooh, only a virgin would make a 
remark like that.” 

“Well, my dear,” said Professor 
Hoogert, “if 1 have to choose 
between a fat paunch and a fat 
head. I’ll just keep my little 
corporation. I think you’ve made 
Mary blush. I think the state of 
Mary Braden’s virginity is a sub- 
ject which must be pursued else- 
where. Mary, my dear, do you 
think that any division of the 
world’s food supply would suffice 
to sustain the teeming millions?” 

He smiled at her. 

Mary Braden shook her head. 
“No, I mean that if people here 
voluntarily felt the edge of hunger, 
it might stimulate them to solve the 
problem.” 

Subchundrum said seriously, 
“Yes, but there is some evidence 
that the blind response of our genes 
to hunger itself stimulates the 
pressure to breed. Starving people 



produce more offspring than 
well-fed people do.” 

“So? Make birth-control a legal 
concomitant of marriage,” 
Charles said. “When Mary and 
Yankele wed, they ought to be 
assigned a quota. Any more and 
crunch! No food for anybody in 
the family.” 

Mary impulsively leaned over 
and put her hand on Yacov’s. “We 
might be relied on — but people 
who are hungry every day? I don’t 
think they can be counted on to be 
rational or to obey quotas. We 
ought to find out.” 

Yacov’s hand turned up and 
tightened on hers. “Marriage 
doesn’t equal children. Children 
require marriage to protect them 
through the plastic learning 
period. But they don’t need it to be 
born. Or to go hungry.” 

Charles laid his hand on top of 
theirs. “Shall we make non-repro- 
duction a three-way pledge? Oh, 
sorry.” His eye fell on Subchun- 
drum. “Four-way, if you like?” 
Subchundrum smiled. “I 
abstain, as my ambassador often 
does at the UN. We preserve later 
freedom of action in this way.” 
Professor Hoogert was preserv- 
ing his own freedom of action by 
stuffing a pipe. He spoke while 
puffing the tobacco alight. 

“It isn’t a bad thing to recog- 
nize — that — birth control — is not 
likely — to come — from simple 

plans — like marital abstinence. 
Some compulsion is needed, eh?”

He glanced around the circle. 
“Yes. Well. Just so. I have caused 
the four of you to meet because 
each of you has betrayed some 
interest in the population problem. 
I hoped each of you would start a 
chain reaction in the other three. 
As a catalyst I seem to have per- 
formed my function.” 

“He means,” his wife said, 
stroking the back of his neck, 
“that he is a spent catalyst.” 

IR,” said Charles, “you nev- 
O er told us what you feel is 
the distinguishing mark of your 
generation. After all, you’re hand- 
ing down the problem.” 

“Why, we are the fulminate of 
war,” Hoogert said. “Strike one of 
us and see the mushroom cloud. 
We sought peace in murder and 
found another of the paradoxes of 
history. We killed more people in 
our years than the whole human 
population of the world had been 
five hundred years earlier, yet we 
leave earth more crowded with 
human animals than when we be- 
gan to kill. So we have led directly 
to you. This world cannot tolerate 
the numerical dominance of any 
one beast at our level. Ecological 
balance is not long denied.” 

“What are we?” asked Yacov, 
looking around at his three con- 
temporaries. 

“Cannibals. In the most literal 
sense. You will eat yourselves if a 
valve for population pressure is 
not found or fashioned. This is the 



great fact of human life which 
marks and will mark every one of 
you.” 

Yacov and Mary looked at each 
other. 

“Cannibals?” she murmured 
dreamily. 

“Valve?” asked Charles Perry. 
“You don’t say solution, or re- 
duction. Valve?” 

“He means,” Subchundrum 
said, “that there is more than one 
way of relieving a pressure.” 

“More than that,” Professor 
Hoogert said. “I want to make it 
clear that I think man is still an 
evolving animal. Whether we take 
the position that, having evolved 
the brain, man has come to the end 
of his individual physical evolution 
and can hope to progress only by 
social evolution, by the elabora- 
tion of societies better adapted to 
the needs of humanity; or that 
there is still significant genetic 
change in man’s future — either way 
the pressure of population is 
important. It is one of the factors 
leading to physical evolution by 
the vast exchange of the gene pool 
and its exposure to the forces of 
mutation; or it is one of the factors 
to make us use our brains to invent 
the more human society which may 
lie in our future. What you must 
seek in your generation is a way to 
control population pressure in 
helping to determine man’s 
future.” 

“Of course,” said Yacov, 
“everybody knows all we have to 



TOO MANY PEOPLE

do is get every nation up to the 
level of affluence of the great 
industrial nations and the birth 
rate falls.” 

Mary Braden said, “Mexico? 
Gross national product rising 
every year, population rising at a 
steady four percent right with it.” 

“Well! it just hasn’t gone on long 
enough. Give them a generation.” 

“Thirty years?” asked Subchun- 
drum. “In thirty years, even if we 
could reduce my country’s annual 
rate of population growth to one 
and a half percent, we should have 
eight hundred and fifty million 
people. At the current rate of better 
than three percent, which is likely 
to endure, our population in the 
year two thousand will be one bil- 
lion people.” 

Professor Hoogert nodded. “So 
where’s the valve?” 

Charles Perry laughed. “Well, 
it’s just a matter of finding it. 
Some simple mechanical way that 
the most ignorant will use to inhibit 
conception.” 

Yacov shook his head. Mary 
said, very seriously, “But if we did 
find a mechanical way the pill is 
controversial but effective and the 
plastic loop is simple and 
cheap how could we persuade 
people to use it? For some people 
known methods are painful or 
frightening or anti-religious. How 
do we get over all those hurdles at 
once?” 

Charles replied, “Lock the food 
supply to contraception. A woman 



would have to show proof she’s 
using one method or another in 
order to get her family’s issue of 
food for the month.” 

UBCHUNDRUM snorted. 
“Charles, forgive me. You are 
a child of industrialism, of close- 
living populations already man- 
aged in so many ways that one 
more won’t matter. Everybody in 
the United States is trained to mass 
transportation, mass work places, 
computer use. The dial telephone 
alone conditions every American 
to mass utilization of computers; 
and the keeping of computer 
records, in credit, in school, in 
public agencies, trains ordinary 
citizens not to cheat and not to for- 
get to do the things that make the 
computer tick: include this 

portion of bill with your check, re- 
turn this stub with questionnaire 
fully filled out, check every answer 
either yes or not — do not fold, 
spindle or mutilate. I know the 
following is hard for you to 
visualize but try to get hold of the 
idea that sixty percent of Mexico’s 
people live in villages of fewer than 
a thousand souls; eighty percent 
of my people the same. Try to 
accept that such people are both 
ignorant and sly and that they have 
a cultural tradition that rule- 
breaking can almost always be 
fixed by an uncle or friend with 
influence. 

“Such people lose count 
honestly. They forget what the 



10 



GALAXY 




count means; if they’re following 
the rhythm method, they can’t 
remember which day is safe and 
which isn’t; or they think the act of 
counting makes the process safe. 
If they’re using pills, they mis- 
match days with pills and destroy 
the effectiveness of the cycle of 
pills. They lose the strings of beads 
we give them to match the count. 
They lose the pills themselves or 
one of the babies swallows them 
and mother is ashamed to admit it 
and ask for more; or the distri- 
butor only comes to the village 
once a month or once a quarter. 

“All these things happen just by 
the human carelessness of people 
in a peasant culture. But people 
don’t expect to be punished by 
starvation just for making a 
human error in a count. You can’t 
hook food supply to pill usage. In 
the first place, neither my people 
nor yours would accept it. They’d 
simply revolt, if it were really en- 
forced. But it couldn’t be en- 
forced. One married woman would 
just share food with another, know- 
ing that next month the need for 
sharing because of a little count- 
ing error might be the other way 
around.” 

“My God,” said Charles, “what 
an impassioned speech. You near- 
ly make me believe the problem 
can’t be solved.” 

“No, he doesn’t mean that,” said 
Yacov. “And he hasn’t even 
touched on religious objections to 
the kind of inhumane coercion you 



proposed. He means it takes more 
than good will and more than 
technical ingenuity to get the job 
done.” 

Mary asked, “Do you mean that 
it takes more even than compul- 
sion?” 

Subchundrum looked at them all 
with something deep and dark 
struggling for expression in his 
red-brown eyes. Then he shrug- 
ged, as if he were unable or un- 
willing to put into words what he 
felt. 

II 

I N THE shifting social life of a 
great university and a great city, 
Charles and Yacov squired many 
young girls to the theater, to 
dances, to protest meetings and 
picket lines — all the rich variety of 
American student life in the 
’sixties. Mary Braden worked her 
way through a score of admirers 
outside their circle; but as the 
undergraduate years slid swiftly 
by, more and more of her time, 
even outside class and lab, was 
spent with Yacov or with 
Charles — or with Subchundrum, 
although he ostensibly removed 
himself from sexual competition 
early in the game. Back home in 
Kerala awaited the bride to whom 
his parents had plighted his troth 
when he was six years old. 

In senior years, even their con- 
tinuing and deepening interest in 
the population problem could not 



TOO MANY PEOPLE 



11 




prevent their being drawn into 
different vortices of scientific 
specialization; but their separation 
in discipline drew them back 
together to exchange and enrich 
each other’s ideas. The childless 
home of the Hoogerts became 
their home. At various times, one 
or more of them boarded there. 

Once, when Mary was living 
with the Hoogerts and the other 
three had come over for Sunday 
night supper, they examined plastic 
loops, various small shapes of 
molded nylon and polyethlene 
which inhibited conception when 
placed in a woman’s uterus. The 
theory was that intra-uterine 
devices were painless and could re- 
main in place for years. When the 
time came for the planned family, 
they could be removed at once 
without side effects and without 
further inhibition of the process of 
reproduction. Mary flung down a 
sheaf of statistics purporting to 
indicate that the lUD was less 
effective in underdeveloped coun- 
tries than in highly industrialized 
ones. 

W¥ OOK at that, Subchundrum!” 
she said. “In the southern 
part of India the damned things 
are said by women to be painful. 
The body processes expel them. 
Even when they’re in place, they 
don’t work as well as they do in 
the United States. How can that 
be?” 

Charles leaned forward, his arm 



around Mary — he was the favored 
one that semester — and picked up 
one of the devices. 

“Maybe women in India just 
don’t accept the idea.” 

“Superstitious, you mean?” 
asked Yacov, lying on the floor, his 
feet up on a chair. 

Subchundrum laughed. “Super- 
stition is involved - but European 
superstition. You people from big 
industrial countries believe a 
smooth, molded piece of plastic 
can do anything; so why should it 
not inhibit birth? My people know 
it is painful and unnatural — so 
they expel or remove it.” 

“Yes,” Mary said, “I can see 
that. The real point is that, 
objectively, it’s effective and pain- 
free. Now how do we educate the 
women of underdeveloped coun- 
tries to know that?” 

Subchundrum glowered. “Ob- 
jective human experience is white, 
temperate-zone, college-educated 
experience. You still believe that, 
don’t you? All you pink ones, you 
just can’t get outside your own 
crippling, anti-human culture to 
understand that any other human 
culture is just as valid as yours.” 
“Oh, come on, Sayji, that’s not 
the implication, meant or un- 
meant.” Yacov sat up and rested 
on one elbow, feet still in the chair. 
“It is a problem of education. It’s 
hard for people in a village who 
never see more than a thousand 
other persons in their lives to un- 
derstand that by doubling their 



12 



GALAXY 




number, they’re doubling three and 
a half or four billion more. It is a 
problem of education.” 

Subchundrum stood up. “I could 
say that too many girls are being 
born and are growing up to child- 
bearing age so quickly and in such 
illiteracy that we can never reach 
them by any process of education. 
But I’ll just say good night.” The 
door slammed behind him before 
anyone could move. He was back 
the next week, however. 

M onths later, the picture was 
the same, except that Yacov 
sat next to Mary and Charles was 
leaning back in a chair, noisily 
grinding an apple to death. Pata- 
sayjit Subchundrum was bearing 
down on the destructive role that 
free will played in their joint inter- 
est. 

“So long as we expect people, by 
some act of will, to overcome the 
deepest instinct of life, we are 
simply whistling in the dark. 
People are not going to cut down 
their own reproduction when it al- 
ways seems to be someone else 
who menaces the world. We are 
running right into the most basic 
human urge.” 

Charles said, “But Sayji, human 
beings are more than any bundle of 
instinctual drives. What has made 
us human is our ability to suppress 
animal drives for long range 
goals.” 

“Yes,” said Mary, “but those 
long range goals have always been 



the good of the immediate 
family — or at most of the tribe or 
nation.” 

“Nationalism is tribalism,’’ 
Yacov declared. 

“Even in Israel?” asked Sub- 
chundrum. 

To which Mary replied, turning 
protectively toward Yacov, “Yes, 
even in Zionism; but that’s a 
different situation. Israel is the 
carrier of the modern tradition. 
The sheikdoms that surround her 
are still in the middle ages.” 

“So!” Subchundrum cried. 
“That gives the Israelis license to 
outbreed their neighbors? Eh, eh, 
Yankele?” 

“Oh, hell, no. But the situation 
is special.” 

“All situations are special,” 
Charles mused as he worked the 
last shreds off his apple core. 

“Right.” Mary sat up out of the 
circle of Yacov’s arm. “That’s why 
the whole emphasis of the struggle 
has to be on education. We’ve got 
to make people want to have fewer 
children. But how?” 

“Or can we?” asked Subchun- 
drum. “Can we, in time? You all 
scoff, more or less, at the efforts 
of my government; but we have ten 
times as many lecturers holding 
clinics and demonstrating the pill, 
the loop, the rhythm method, as 
any other country. We offer peo- 
ple the choice of method and our 
demonstrations are convincing be- 
cause they are conducted in slums, 
country and city, where waves of

children with big bellies and sad 
eyes are always washing around the 
ankles of the women in the aud- 
ience. We educate the men, too, 
but what measurable good does it 
do us? We may be slowing down 
the rate of increase but we are 
hardly denting the increase in ab- 
solute numbers. Every time you 
eat an apple, Charles, another 
thousand Indians begin to wail and 
starve.” 

Charles licked his fingers. “I say 
what Hoogie told us a long time 
ago. No use appealing to me to eat 
less. That won’t stem the tide of 
hunger in Madras.” 

“Yes,” said Mary, always fair. 
“You’re right. You’re right, in our 
terms. In terms of the whole 
problem of human population on 
the planet earth, you’re wrong. 
Animals react to starvation pres- 
sure by dropping more cubs. So do 
human beings.” 

Yacov said what one or the other 
of them had said a thousand times. 
“Human beings are animals. To 
that extent, instinctual drives do 
move great numbers of people. Un- 
less we can educate them all to 
stand against those drives, we can 
never hope to correct the upward 
curve of the population figures, 
never, never.” 



G raduation came, degrees 
and honors, graduate school, 
jobs in separated corners of the 
world. Subchundrum invited them 



all to be his guests in Mexico at a 
conference on population control 
methods, sending out a round-rob- 
in letter in which he hinted broadly 
that he had found a new method, 
and that it might be the method. 

When they all assembled at Sub- 
chundrum’s country home in 
Cauhtla, he teased them first with 
mysterious glances, insisted on 
two rounds of tequila sours and 
then began, inexplicably, to 
reminisce about his boyhood in 
Kerala, at the tip of the Indian sub- 
continent. 

“Cauhtla is like home in many 
ways. The mountain elevation is 
homelike and the sweaty hand of 
the tropics, so much more felt here 
than in Cuernavaca, three hundred 
meters higher, also makes me feel 
at home.” 

Yacov said, “Sayji, I flew five 
thousand kilometers to get here 
and left my two last classes of the 
semester to be taught by my 
assistant, a young woman of such 
monumental stupidity as only 
American university politics 
could saddle me with. I can’t stay 
for the whole conference. Tell us 
about your new chemical agent and 
let’s get to the testing.” 

“You think it is chemical?” 

“Well, you’re working for the 
largest producer of synthetic 
hormones in the world. Makes 
sense that your research ought to 
benefit your employer some way.” 

Sayji chuckled. “You ought to 
know someone raised in Kerala 



14 



GALAXY 




would not have any slavish 
adherence to the idea of profits for 
the employer. And this is a 
Mexican employer. The outfit can 
only fire me for cause — and pur- 
suing a line of research that will not 
benefit the corporation is not 
cause.” 

Mary went to him, laying her 
gold-tanned hand on his mahogany 
wrist. “Come on, Sayji. Don’t 
tease us. What have you learned?” 

He set down his drink. “I have 
learned that chemical control, in 
the sense of some compound that 
will do all our work for us, is not 
within our grasp now. There is 
something stirring in the back of 
my mind, you understand, but it’s 
not even to the writing-down stage, 
not even to playing with the 
mathematics of the cell. 

“Chemical this is, yes; but — I 
am almost ashamed to say it — very 
American, very European. Not at 
all the sort of life-oriented 
chemistry you have a right to 
expect from me, dear ones. Here it 
is.” He dropped a handful of small 
plastic shapes and a larger one, 
something like a baker’s pastry 
tube, on the cocktail table that had 
been carved from a whole tree. The 
white plastic shapes lay in an ugly 
sort of pattern on the dark wood of 
the table. 

Charles was the first to com- 
prehend. All three thought through 
the tequila, at first, that the loop 
shapes were significant; and while 
they were handling them and 



realizing it was the same old 
collection of toroids and helixes 
that were supposed to inhibit hu- 
man conception, Charles suddenly 
picked up the icing tube shape and 
began to work it, with a sheepish 
grin. 

“By God, 1 thought of this once 
but gave up too soon. It’s an 
applicator, isn’t it? You don’t need 
a doctor to make the implant.” 

“Yes,” said Subchundrum, “so 
what?” 

“Oh,” said Yacov. “It’s fool- 
proof, is it?” 

“Is anything?” 

Mary said, “Well, Sayji, is it or 
isn’t it?” 

“Foolproof? Oh yes, it’s fool 
proof. But, of course, it isn’t fools 
we have to deal with.” 

Charles broke in. “It works, 
though? The woman can put the 
loop in place and remove it with- 
out the necessity of a doctor’s or a 
midwife’s helping her? Sayji, this 
is the breakthrough of the age. 
Every teenage girl in the world will 
want one as soon as she hears 
about it.” 

Subchundrum laughed in the 
way they had come to know meant 
he was embarrassed. “Yes, of 
course — when she hears about it 
and can afford the few pennies or 
her government can afford the few 
pennies or — ” 

“Or what?” Charles was ready 
to start the manufacture of the 
applicators at once. 

“Oh, I only mean that we still

face the problem of making these 
teenage girls — real teenage girls 
in villages and cities where the 
teenagers are not like the ones in 
your middle-class American head, 
Charlie — want not to be mothers. 
Women want a child, or two or 
three children. They just don’t 
want too many, that’s all. But what 
number becomes too many? If you 
have three, four are just as easy to 
care for. And if child-bearing and 
child-rearing are really the only 
honorable courses open in life to a 
girl child, why should she practice 
this trick? What’s in it for her as a 
person, not just as a point on a 
statistical curve?” 

“Well, education — ” 

“Mary, Mary!” Subchundrum 
whirled on her. “What about your- 
self? You’ve stretched adolescence 
as far as even an American girl 
can. Well, Doctor Braden, isn’t 
there something else you want 
from life? How long will you resist 
your deepest desires?” 

Mary sat down with great 
deliberation. Charles and Yacov 
looked at her quietly and specula- 
tively. She set her glass down on 
the tiled floor and then fixed Sub- 
chundrum with a direct and un- 
smiling stare. “Sayji, is this a pro- 
posal? What about the girl in 
Kerala?” 

“Call it a proposition, if you 
like. 1 am as cool as you.” 

“Are you just demonstrating 
something?” 

“Perhaps 1 am. But you will 



have to find out what it is that I 
am demonstrating.” 

The evening was ruined and the 
discussion died. Dr. Sub- 
chundrum’s enthusiasm, which had 
assembled them all again, had 
curdled in the heat of his own 
doubts about the device, and in 
something Mary’s presence had 
called out of him, something so far 
from the control that had marked 
him in their student years that 
Yacov and Charles could only 
shake their heads as they drove 
back to Mexico City. 

Mary remained. Neither she nor 
Subchundrum ever told the other 
two whether she was there for days 
or for months. No child came of it; 
but as for the new device, Sayji’s 
doubts proved well founded. It was 
one more weapon. It was a long 
way from being the weapon. 

A YEAR or two passed. Mary’s 
postcards bore a Boston post- 
mark. Subchundrum had been 
working in a laboratory in 
Holland. They were all in New 
York at a conference and evening 
found them in Yankele’s suite with 
their shoes off and drinks in hand. 
Yacov was spending government 
money that year, and declared that 
his motto was. Live a little. He 
waved a glass to take in the opulent 
suite and all it implied. 

There was a fifth wheel, a 
physicist who had been in school 
with them, blown into their group 
that night by a chance wind. He 



16 



GALAXY 




had a wry, studious sort of humor, 
so they had kept him with them 
after dinner, made him attend a 
seminar with them, and now they 
were all talking about anything 
and everything in the world except 
their consuming interest, of which 
they were all heartily sick for the 
moment. 

The physicist commented on 
that. “Whatever happened to all 
those dirty stories the four of you 
used to tell?” 

“Dirty stories?” asked Mary in 
her direct way. 

“Well, all that talk about 
genitalia and the economy of the 
uterus would have been dirty 
stories in any other gang I ever 
hung out with.” 

Mary lounged back against 
Charles’ shoulder and he snorted. 
“That’s the thanks we get for try- 
ing to keep this cluck from being 
up to his hip pockets in human 
embryos. Trailbreakers are never 
understood.” 

“Ahh,” said the physicist, 
“you’re not trailbreakers. You 
talk dirty, but you’re afraid to face 
up to the only radical solution 
possible now. Several of the most 
populous nations on the face of the 
earth need to take a twenty-five or 
thirty-year vacation from having 
any children at all.” 

“That’s a solution?’’ Yacov 
asked lazily. “That ain’t even a 
statement of the problem.” 

“Sure it’s a solution. All the 
children born for the next ten 



years in India, China, Indonesia, 
Mexico, Southern Italy, the 
Balkans and the whole Mediterra- 
nean shore have got to be sterilized 
at birth.” 

The collective howl was the pay- 
off he had been playing for. The 
physicist chuckled, wiping 
Yankele’s drink off his shirt, even 
as Yankele continued to shout. 

He said, “But isn’t that really 
what you ought to be working for? 
Isn’t that what you want? It’s cer- 
tainly what I want. I’m willing to 
have it start in my generation.” 

“You’ve got two children, you 
goddamned white genocidist!” 
Charles cried. 

“Okay, okay, don’t get hot. 
Sterilize my two kids. I don’t think 
much of my genetic inheritance. 
Hell, I haven’t even got a Nobel 
and I’m looking forty in the teeth. 
Sterilize all my neighbor’s kids, 
too. I’m ge'nerous. And I’m really a 
hell of a lot more altruistic than 
you fakes. This would solve the 
problem? You’re just working to 
make it only a little worse each 
year.” 

Subchundrum grinned like a 
tubby shark. “All right. I’m not 
angry. I think you’re right. I’m a 
member of the Cabinet in New 
Delhi. Now, Mr. Prime Minister, 
after you have given me carte 
blanche to put this solution into 
effect, give me also the political 
campaign which will make it 
acceptable to my people from 
Kashmir to Kerala. Just give me a

formula that will keep us from 
being toppled from office before 
we carry out ten years of emascula- 
tions and hysterectomies on new 
born babies. I’m listening, really 1 
am.” 

The physicist said, with interest, 
“Subchundrum, are you really in 
the cabinet?” 

“No, you idiot. I’m working in 
Holland. I haven’t been home in so 
long 1 have no idea what the 
politics are now. I’m posing you a 
hypothetical situation. Now give 
me the answer — because there has 
to be an answer. If you can’t give it 
to me, then don’t make easy solu- 
tions. Go get the eight-fold way 
back down to one-fold and leave us 
alone with our clumsy human 
problems.” 

“Oh hell, Palasayjit, I’m like the 
owl that told the arthritic centi- 
pede to change himself into a 
mouse so he’d have only one 
twenty-fifth as much pain. I don’t 
know how you’re going to do it. I 
function only on the policy-mak- 
ing level. The tactics and the hard- 
ware are up to you.” 

They all agreed, after he left, 
that he was disgusting. Now, 
years later, could they honestly say 
that line of thought had not in- 
fluenced them? 



T hey turned over another cou- 
ple of pictures — failures that 
had brought them down the road to 
this desperate success. The morn- 



ing-after pill, which a turn of 
Mary’s research into hormone 
control had made infallible, had 
faltered on the basic shortcoming 
of all plans that required volun- 
tary use of the inhibiting agent. 
Human beings found ways to for- 
get, reasons to forget — even many 
a comfortable American husband, 
confident that his wife was taking 
the infallible barrier to con- 
ception, suddenly found himself a 
father. 

In the poor countries the re- 
searchers were defeated over and 
over by the bedrock fact that 
children are wealth in a culture of 
poverty. Not only children starve 
in a famine — old people who have 
no children to fall back on starve 
as well. Fear and love and the 
genetic memory of a time when 
man was a naked minority among 
mammals all combined to edge 
the total number of human beings 
in the world over four billion, to- 
ward five billion, six billion, to- 
ward cannibalism. 

Yacov led them through the last 
illusion: vaccination. 

It was simply impossible to 
make people want anti-birth 
vaccination, just as it had been 
impossible to make people want 
the twenty-year time pill, another 
brilliant group of researchers had 
thought was the answer. The 
twenty-year time pill was at least 
measurable. Taken at 18, it 
opened the door to parenthood at 
38; but it never became a popular 



18 



GALAXY 




arrow in the quiver of attacks on 
human fecundity. 

Vaccination, the process by 
which a woman was made immune 
to male sperm, or a man immune 
to his own sperm, so that he ceased 
to produce a viable seed, had all 
the residual irrational human 
opposition to vaccination to over- 
come, as well as one quality which 
made it hard for propagandists to 
push it. The vaccine’s effect was 
variable. For some people it was 
lifetime immunization. For others 
it was extremely short-lived — and 
the duration proved to be unpre- 
dictable. 

But the exchange of ideas and 
research among the four old friends 
on the relatively unproductive 
subject of vaccination led Sub- 
chundrum at last to the greatest 
discover of their lives. 

The turn came when he sent 
word to Mary, Charles and Yacov. 
“Come to Kerala!” Subchundrum 
wrote. “I have the money from my 
government, a free hand to build 
the labs I want and, best of all, I 
have the approach!” Two pages of 
cell mathematics followed. The 
mathematics were what drew 
them. 

“All wrong, darling,” said Mary 
as she stepped off the plane, “but 
so provocative!” 

Ill 

T he machines that were to 
change the four investigators 



from passive inhibitors of the birth 
process to active interveners in that 
process were already fixed in the 
main laboratory. Two massive 
micro-manipulators had been 
modified to perform chromoscvme 
surgery. 

Charles gaped and then smiled. 
“These let us get right to the 
innards of the cell, hey? 1 suppose 
you can even repair LSD chromo- 
some breakage with this, right?” 

Subchundrum seemed to have 
gotten younger, to have regained 
the calm confidence of their 
undergraduate days. He had cer- 
tainly become thinner again. “We 
can work even on virus mechanics 
with these things and that is where 
we shall be working.” 

Mary smiled and shook her 
head. “Dr. Subchundrum, you 
have flipped your autoclave. The 
steam has all escaped. The dif- 
ferences between human cells and 
viruses are so great that if we 
elucidated all the knowledge there 
will ever be about viruses — a hun- 
dred years’ work, say — we would 
still not be much closer to solving 
our problem of humanely keeping 
down human populations.” 

Charles kicked a lab table with a 
dirty sneaker. “That’s right, Sayji; 
or at least, it seems to me right. 
Have you discovered some affinity 
between viral structure and human 
cell structure hidden from the rest 
of us?” 

Yacov smacked Charles might- 
ily on the shoulder. “None so blind 



TOO MANY PEOPLE 



19 




as cannot see, eh, Subchundrum? I 
see it because I was the responsible 
executive on the vaccination proj- 
ect. The affinity between human 
cell and virus is that viruses like 
to live inside human cells.” 

Charles rubbed his upper arm. 
“Sure, but those are diseases. We 
don’t want to infect the whole 
human race with some plague.” 
“Don’t we?’’ asked Mary. 
“Don’t we? Why not? I see, Sayji; 
you’ve built on the work of the re- 
searchers who have used viruses to 
create a beneficial infection.” 
“Beneficial!” cried Charles. 
“What illness is beneficial?” 

“My dear, many a woman has 
welcomed a week of flu. For the 
price of a little fever and nausea 
she can drop ten pounds at a frac- 
tion of the price and effort it 
would take in a salon.” 

Yacov picked it up. “More to 
the point, Stanfield Rogers and his 
followers have already demon- 
strated that a virus deadly to one 
animal — Peyton Rous’ chicken 
sarcoma virus, for instance — is 
just a harmless passenger in man. 
Rogers showed that the Shope vi- 
rus, which makes cancerous tu- 
mors in rabbits, suffers a benign 
conversion in man’s bloodstream, 
where it elaborates a special form 
of the common enzyme, arginase. 
Haven’t you read some of his 
work?” 

“Sure,” Charlie said musingly. 
“The bacteriophage, the virus that 
eats bacteria, is itself the agent of 



the toxin in diphtheria. Only those 
diphtheria bacilli which have in- 
herited a particular strain of 
bacteriophage make the deadly 
toxin. Other strains are nearly 
harmless. I knew that.” 

Mary spoke. “And somebody, I 
forget who, has been looking for 
a virus that would be silent as to 
disease but would manufacture the 
missing enzyme that will let re- 
tarded children be as normal 
ones.” She snapped her fingers. 
“Who’s doing that, Subchundrum?” 

“Never mind,” Yacov broke in, 
“it doesn’t matter. The point is we 
can start with a viral disease which 
often does cause sterility and 
modify it to produce the sterility 
without the sickness. Wait a 
minute, though, Sayji, how are you 
going to get people to hold still for 
inoculations when they won’t 
accept vaccination and the twenty- 
year time pill?” 

“Ah, you have missed the impor- 
tant point. The lesser aspect first: 
we don’t need inoculation, to 
circulate a virus, once it’s im- 
planted. The practical effect of 
Salk showed that. After an 
extended period of administration 
of the Salk vaccine, supplemented 
later by the Sabin preparations, a 
new child who moves into the area 
of Salk protection catches the 
immunizing virus from the other 
kids instead of the crippling, some- 
times fatal wild strain of polio- 
myelitis. And of course, nobody 
ever has to be inoculated to catch 



20 



GALAXY 




flu or polio. The virulent strain of 
the nineteen-eighteen influenza 
spread itself — and eventually died 
out itself, squeezed for existence 
by the sickening but infrequently 
fatal strains we have to deal with 
every winter.” 

“All right. The lesser aspect is 
pretty good. Now tell me number 
two.” 

“It’s really a corollary or ex- 
tension of number one, but it 
means the breakthrough that 
finally lets our work become 
meaningful. We don’t need any- 
one’s voluntary consent to put this 
into effect.” 

“What?” cried Charles. “How 
the hell do you get ’em to take it if 
you don’t have consent?” 

Mary said, “Dear idiot, you 
haven’t been listening to sweet old 
Subchundrum. He proposes to 
infect the whole human race. Sayji, 
love. Hitler was a piker to you. 
How do you propose to reverse 
this mass castration? I still haven’t 
had my child, you know. I’m 
interested.” 



P ATASAYJIT SUBGHUN- 
DRUM smiled and waved his 
hand at the functionally beautiful 
micro-manipulators. “To the 
machines, children. What we have 
to construct is a virus that is 
obedient to some kind of com- 
mand. I don’t know the answer. 
But now — and frankly for the first 
time, — I know there is an answer. 



This cannot be a dead end, as so 
much of work has been. We can- 
not stop with a virus that produces 
sterility — nor with one that 
might ultimately destroy the hu- 
man gene pool.” 

“Right,” said Mary. “It’s some- 
body in Roger’s group who’s work- 
ing on the mental retardation 
enzyme. Some of the children who 
fit the classification of retarded 
are so because they have a genetic 
disease, phenylketonuria. Their 
bodies don’t elaborate phenyla- 
lanine hydroxylase, which the 
brain needs for normal function. 
The virus gardeners are trying to 
breed a mutation which will be a 
silent virus otherwise but will pro- 
duce the missing enzyme.” 

“Exactly,” said Subchundrum. 
“I do not propose to wait for 
mutations induced by cosmic rays 
or even by plasmas. I propose that 
we rework the genetic codes of 
some virus to make it remember a 
bias against human birth; and at 
the same time, to leave it subject 
to easy defeat when we get ready to 
license a birth from a particular 
man and woman.” 

“First the infection and then the 
examination of the whole human 
race to determine who shall 
breed?” Charles asked. “That’s 
rather godlike, isn’t it?” 

Sayji answered with a twinkle. 
“Hindu gods can do all. They are 
not dead and they are not in 
Argentina either. Come, come, to 
work!” 



TOO MANY PEOPLE

W ITH some misgivings, they 
all set to work: Dr. Subchun- 
drum was bothered more than he 
cared to admit by the ethical im- 
plications of the research. As long 
as success was not quite within 
their grasp, however, he could put 
off the final accounting which 
would bring him to the decision of 
whether and when to unleash an 
anti-birth infection upon the world. 

Mary Braden and Subchundrum 
were the genetic surgeons of the 
tearh. They had a delicacy of mani- 
pulative behavior in their hands 
and eyes that was lacking in those 
of Charles Perry and Yacov Har- 
Shawkor. It fell to Yankele and 
Charlie to do the mathematics and 
program the computer analogues 
which screened the manipulated 
viruses, and to handle the breed- 
ing experiments that tested the 
few altered viruses the computers 
found promising. 

What all had expected to be the 
big hurdle was cleared within 
months. It proved to be almost 
easy to create a virus that colonized 
male testes and killed each sperm 
as it grew. What seemed to be 
impossible to accomplish was to 
make the virus itself viable. 

A virus could be defined as a cell 
stripped of nonessentials; a hippie 
cell, Mary had said. There still 
was a nucleus, so to speak, but the 
organism had deprived itself of 
all those attributes which ordin- 
arily go to independent function- 
ing. Viruses could reproduce 



themselves and live within host 
cells. During most of their life 
cycles they depended on the cell 
wall of the host for pro- 
tection — and it was only if the cell 
wall collapsed because the cell had 
died — or the virus had killed 
it — that a virus needed to wrap its 
essential components — its genetic 
ability to reproduce-- in some sort 
of film for the migration to 
another cell. 

The mutated, rebuilt viruses 
Doctors Braden and Sub- 
chundrum found it easy to turn out 
lacked one essential feature of 
self-protection. Instead of being 
parasitic, able to live off a host, kill 
it and drift in a little inner space- 
ship to another and enter it, they 
were symbiotic. Living within the 
sperm, they throve. When that life 
killed the sperm, the squatter virus 
died with it. 

Dependent to the end. 

The problem was one they did 
not seem able to solve. “No exit,” 
Charlie snarled one night at dinner. 
“We’re going to be right here — 
footling around with submicroscop- 
ic particles of memory chains — 
when the solid wave of humanity 
breaks over those mountains and 
rolls us into the Indian sea. There 
isn’t any answer- -only the prob- 
lem. Krishna or Vishnu meant the 
human race to end in race suicide. 
Dinosaurs died. Dodos died. A 
million years from now, there’ll be 
some tiny bipeds hiding under 
leaves, left over from our age the 



22 



GALAXY 




way iguanas are left over from the 
reptilian. Damn!” 

No one could oppose him, except 
with faith. “Faith!” he spat. “Faith 
in the scientific process? Like 
those poor devils with the ear 
troubles from monitoring static 
from the stars? Pfui!” 

Nevertheless, they continued to 
work, without much apparent 
enthusiasm but the dogged care of 
professionals. Even Charles was 
patiently methodical about his 
computer programs and methodi- 
cally cursed lab assistants who let 
sperm cultures die of neglect or, 
finding one dead, threw it out 
without trying to understand 
how it had been killed. 



I T WAS Subchundrum who real- 
ized at last the essential natural 
element they were leaving out of 
the ecology they were trying to 
construct for their mutated virus. 

“Most diseases we think of as 
virus diseases,” he said to the 
others one gray morning when he 
had woken with a headache and an 
idea that vanquished his headache, 
“are not transmitted directly from 
one person to another. They are 
vectored." 

“Yes,” Mary said. “An insect or 
another animal serves as a conduit. 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever is 
carried from a sick individual to a 
well one by a mite. Typhus is 
vectored through lice.” 

Charles spoke. “For some 



viruses the movement through a 
carrier is an essential part of the 
life cycle. Maybe that’s true for our 
little old sperm-killer. Let’s start 
the testing with fleas. They’re easy 
enough to find.” 

So the search began. It was 
wide-ranging, in depth, relent- 
less — and unsuccessful. Fleas of 
every variety were tried and found 
wanting. Mites rejected the virus 
as if it were an inert protein 
particle. The blood of rodents 
destroyed it. To birds it was a 
quickly dissipated intoxicant. No 
animal could be found to transmit 
the tiny killers back into man’s 
bloodstream in effective form. 

A vigorous attempt was made to 
render the virus pneumonic, so 
that it could be allied to influenza 
and transmitted rapidly by 
sneezing, coughing and kissing. 
The virus particles simply fell out 
in such passage. Nothing revealed 
the artificial nature of Sub- 
chundrum’s virus more than this: it 
could only be made effective by 
inoculation. The anti-birth virus 
seemed for a long time to be just 
another dead end. 

The project lost its elan. 
Workers began to leave for glam- 
orous projects elsewhere with 
more pleasant surroundings and 
better prospects. Many went to 
other silent virus programs that 
were trying to eliminate mongo- 
loidism, premature births and 
childhood leukemia. 

“It’s not bad enough,” said

Yacov, “that they leave us. In a 
sense, they go over to the enemy.” 

Mary finally made the sugges- 
tion that became the core of the 
team’s last joint operation. She 
was no longer diffident, as she had 
been when they first met; but this 
suggestion was timidly put for- 
ward one Saturday afternoon 
when they were brainstorming the 
problem. 

“Fellow doctors, perhaps we 
have been approaching the 
question of a vector for the virus in 
a manner too restricted to allow 
the answer to be seen. We have 
been thinking of transmission 
from man to man via some other 
species.” 

Subchundrum said, “That’s the 
way all vectored viruses work. 
Man-mite-man; man-flea-rat-flea- 
man; man-mosquito-man. What 
are you getting at?” 

Mary patted the back of her 
hair. “Just that man as a species 
isn’t all male. Woman is also man. 
We’ve concentrated on male- 
species-X-male, forgetting that 
many diseases, particularly genetic 
ones, pass man-woman-man. May- 
be that’s the natural passage we’ve 
been seeking for Subchundrum’s 
virus.” 



M ary spoke on a Saturday af- 
ternoon; but neither holidays 
nor weekends on a regular basis 
were recognized in Subchundrum’s 
biological laboratory. Within an 



hour all four scientists were at 
work. Within a week, the vortex of 
their activity pulled in the rest of 
the project personnel. 

First Subchundrum and Braden 
had to structure the inheritance 
pattern of the virus to affect the 
mice who were the starting point 
of their experiments in vivo. The 
computer work and the breeding 
experiments had to follow. Then 
the living particles had to be 
modified to repeat their sterilizing 
migrations in the monkey colony; 
and last, the great step of infecting 
human beings had to be under- 
taken. 

At that moment, Yacov had 
been compelled to leave for a 
week’s conference in New Delhi, 
not to reveal what Subchun- 
drum’s project was doing, but to 
see what he could find out of any 
other project that might aid the 
virus research. He learned noth- 
ing, except that the great thrust of 
research was still to find the 
method which should be so simple, 
so cheap and so foolproof that 
earth’s breeding billions would 
overnight adopt it. The ethical, 
religious, emotional and econornic 
blocks that might keep even such a 
remedy from being adopted were 
still being dealt with on the slow, 
agonizing basis of education and 
propaganda. 

Yacov HarShawkor had taken 
the plane out of New Delhi in a 
mixture of depression and excited 
anticipation. He was depressed be- 



24 



GALAXY 




cause there had been no hint that 
other groups were aiming in the 
same direction as Subchundrum’s. 
He was excited because he hoped 
his colleagues had succeeded. 
Yacov knew that great discoveries 
in this day and time took place 
almost in parallel because of the 
instant exchange of ideas in the 
scientific community and the 
immense sums available to re- 
search. Like war, research had be- 
come a stable and calculable 
contributor to the gross national 
product of many countries. 

But, he thought, w haven’t pub- 
lished. Maybe others also have 
failed to publish. One hated to fail 
in a grandiose design. And yet, no 
one could be really comfortable 
about a remedy that stepped over 
the line from persuasion and 
voluntary use to compulsion and 
involuntary infection. 

Ah, well. I’ll get a nap and when 
I get back to the lab compound 
Sayji and Charlie will shrug and 
tell me this line didn’t work, either. 
We’ll let the governments face the 
ethical problem when we have the 
gun in our hands. 



H e had walked off the plane 
into the nightmare of hunting 
Mary Braden down. Now Sub- 
chundrum and Perry were explain- 
ing to him the imponderable and 
unpredictable way in which the 
last experiment had exceeded the 
level of success. 



“It’s enough,” Perry said, “to 
make a man believe in a directed 
universe. Since we decided a 
human female would be the vector 
we’ve hardly done anything that 
missed. Every step of the work has 
gone like greased lightning.” 

“Why not?” asked Subchun- 
drum. “We have become experts.” 
“Yes,” said Charles, “but it’s all 
been better than expert. I’m re- 
membering what Hoogie used to 
say: ‘This world does not tolerate 
the dominance of one animal at 
the level man has reached.’ I tell 
you, it seems as if some great 
principle has pushed us on; and 
having Mary, or the focus of in- 
fection Mary became, loose on 
the world would have brought the 
human race to an effective end in 
this generation. 1 mourn Mary; 
but thank God we killed that 
carrier of the virus. Now we’ve got 
to start in and rework it.” 

Subchundrum spoke. “It was 
that errant fireball.” 

“What?” said Yacov. “Talk 
sense. Speak paragraphs. Remem- 
ber you’re trying to teach me 
something. Attack it in an 
organized way, will you?” 

“Well, you know there’s a 
station about twenty miles away, 
up in the foothills, where they are 
doing plasma research. Those 
fellows don’t say, but I think 
they’re trying to make a genie for 
war — some way of binding a 
plasma with its hard radiation in a 
brass bottle you could unplug in

an enemy’s face or in his factory. 
They’re up there where they can 
tap the hydro-electric plants for all 
the power they need; and they’re 
using it by the megawatt.” 

“So?” 

“So last week, right after you 
left, they lost a fireball. A great 
globe of lightning wandered 
around here all night, flickering, 
looking in windows, perching on 
rooftrees, playing tag with us all 
over the place. 

“We were all ready to go with a 
batch of virus the three of us had 
vetted. Mary and 1 had decided — 
and we persuaded Charles — that 
the three of us should test the vec- 
tor pattern. We thought some of 
the hard radiation that lightning 
ball hurled off might have got at 
my deadly babies. After all, in 
glass they’re as vulnerable as fish 
in a barrel.” 

“What did you do?” 

“All three of us, Yacov — all 
three of us — went over the batch 
with the electron microscope. I 
swear none of us saw a genetic stut- 
ter in the bunch. We were still 
wrong to use that culture. I’ve 
incinerated the rest of the batch in 
an electric crucible.” 

“Right, Sayji. That’s what you 
should have done in the first place. 
In a culture of billions, examina- 
tion of a few thousand left a 
whacking great statistical possi- 
bility that you wouldn’t see a major 
mutation.” 

“Yankele, we were all in a fever. 



Thai’s the truth. Mary cast her 
vote yes, too.” 

“Fever is right — you killed my 
girl with it.” 

C HARLES spoke up, soberly. 

“Yacov, she was your girl for 
this month, maybe last year. You 
know better than to think it would 
have lasted forever. We’ve all been 
Mary’s ‘one man’ many times. 
She loved us all and we all loved 
her and the time has gone by when 
any of us could be jealous of her 
favors. Sayji and 1 killed her, sure; 
so did that fireball, so did she and 
so did you.” 

“All right, leave it! What 
happened?” 

Charles spread his hands. “It 
worked, that’s what happened. 
We’ve got the answer in our hands, 
as soon as we can attenuate the 
effect of the virus on the female 
vector. That effect was a wild, 
unpredictable thing that we’ve got 
to control. Sayji and I are as 
sterile as two eunuchs; but it killed 
Mary.” 

“How?” 

Subchundrum spoke. “The first 
leg of the vectoring as accom- 
plished between Mary and me 
under proper laboratory condi- 
tions of sanitation and observa- 
tion. Then we gave it forty-eight 
hours for the virus to multiply in 
her bloodstream, before she 
effected the transfer to Charlie.” 
“And then? Was she healthy up 
to that point?” 



26 



GALAXY 




“Absolutely. Temperature, 
pulse, respiration, blood count, 
odor, urine, all just the old Mary 
we knew. You tell him what hap- 
pened next, Charlie.” 

“We left the lab room where we 
had been, with all the instruments 
for recording the conditions 
under which the transfer took 
place. 1 walked her to her quarters. 
1 went on to mine, took a shower 
and dressed. In about twenty min- 
utes from the time we left the lab 
she phoned me. ‘Come over here,’ 
she said. 

“When 1 walked in she was still 
wearing the robe in which she had 
left the lab. Yacov, she just took it 
off and came at me. 1 thought — for 
about half a minute — of whether 
this could affect the experiment 
and then forgot it. When we 
finished 1 put on my pants and shirt 
and laughed. ‘Okay, Mary,’ I said, 
‘now 1 have to shower again and 
get back to work. I’ll see you at 
lunch.’ All 1 had noticed was an in- 
crease in temperature. She was 
like an oven, but 1 thought — oh, 
well, you know. Fifteen minutes 
later she was out on the com- 
pound.” 

“Nymphomania?” 

“Something more,” said Sub- 
chundrum. “Something elemental, 
Yacov. She was like a tornado. 1 



don’t suppose there’s a man on the 
station she didn’t sterilize. We had 
to sedate her and feed her intra- 
venously. And tonight she evaded 
us anyway.” 

Yacov stood. “We have to finish 
this now. We’ve got to find the 
cure — or the method of attenua- 
tion of the virus. We’ve got to pro- 
tect the women in the villages 
around us from the men who work 
here. I’ll stick to the end; but I 
don’t want either of you to say a 
word to me that isn’t business; and 
when it’s over, 1 don’t ever want to 
see or hear either of you again.” he 
turned and strode out. 

I T WAS four days later, just as 
they readied a new strain, that 
news of the outbreaks reached 
them from the villages five and ten 
miles away; two days later the first 
epidemic reports from New Delhi- 
and ten days later the postcard 
came airmail from New York. 

As Yacov read it tears started 
from his eyes; but whether they 
were tears of relief, of love or of 
fear, he could not have told. In 
familiar handwriting, the post- 
card’s message was: 

“Flesh wound in shoulder heal- 
ing nicely. Ecological balance is 
not denied. Wish you were here. 
Mary.” ★

SNOW PRINCESS 




I 



S LEEP had been spasmodic; the 
night had been punctuated by 
the staccato of gunfire above the 
wailing of the eternal wind. 

“For God’s sake go and see 
what’s happening, Jacko,” Cock- 
ade had whined petulantly, snug- 
ly gling closer to Switch who humped 
in his sleep, muttering. 

Resignedly Jacko had struggled 
out of his sleeping bag and 
mounted the ladder to the gallery 
which circled the inside of the 
church spire. He had patrolled the 
circumference of the narrow 
Y platform, staring out through the 
crude gaps punched through the 
tiles, fingering his rifle. He had 
seen nothing; the shots had ceased. 
Flesh-hunters pursuing some un- 
lucky traveler, he had decided, 
shivering as the wind-borne show 
furred his cheeks. 

Below, Cockade had waked 
again. “How the hell can we sleep 
with you tramping about up 
there?” Her voice was querulous. 
Already she had forgotten the 
purpose of his patrol. 

Carefully, Jacko descended the 
ladder. The fire glowed low in the 
huge, upturned bronze bell. Cock- 
ade and Switch were sleeping once 
more, huddled together in reluc- 
tant interdependence. Beyond, 
the dim hummock of Shrug, snor- 
ing softly. 

Jacko felt a surge of protective 
pride. These were his people, his 



29 




tribe. He loved them, didn’t he? 

I N THE morning Shrug joined 
him on the gallery. 

“Something happened last 
night? Cockade’s gone sour 
again.” 

“She heard gunfire.’’ Jacko 
gazed out across the tossing snow- 
fields. The wind never ceased to 
blow; today it was stronger than 
usual, sifting the surface of the 
snow past the spire in a flowing 
sea, driving across the buried vil- 
lage. The spire, a defiant finger of 
drowning civilization, was the 
only landmark in the silver 
wastes. “I should have heard it my- 
self. I was asleep.” 

“And we might all have been 
killed!” shrilled Cockade’s voice 
from below, a vinegar condi- 
ment to, the aroma of frying bac- 
on. 

“Oh. I didn’t hear anything, 
either.” Shrug’s eyelashes were 
heavy with snow as he stared 
through the hole; he blinked wet- 
ness. “Flesh-hunters, do you 
think?” 

“I suppose so. Maybe we ought 
to mount guard at night again,” 
Jacko speculated reluctantly. 
The guard would consist of him- 
self and Shrug. Cockade and 
Switch had their private fears; 
they shrank from the gray Out- 
side. 

“Or perhaps we should move 
on — once the Snow Princess is fin- 
ished.” Shrug raised his voice on 



the last word for the benefit of the 
two cooks below. 

“Breakfast is getting cold.” 

“Coming.” The two men des- 
cended the ladder. Jacko first, a 
tall figure in a stylish black over- 
coat; then Shrug, smaller, squat 
and ragged. 

Switch watched them from be- 
side the fire. “Get you some new 
clothes today, Shrug,” he offered, 
friendly, hoping to bridge the 
endless gulf between the two fac- 
tions of the community. 

“Let him get his own.” Cock- 
ade spoke automatically, fork- 
ing bacon into her mouth. 

“1 can, you know.” 

“You never could.” 

Switch tried to change the sub- 
ject. 

“You think the flesh-hunters 
came from the north?” 

“I was in the ice corridors a 
month or so ago,” Shrug defended 
himself. Idleness, not claustro- 
phobia, chained him to the bell 
tower. 

“Yes, blind drunk.” 

Jacko sighed. They all knew 
Cockade was unable to climb the 
ladder; was scared sick of the 
snowfields and the open sky. So 
she attacked Shrug endlessly. It 
was her defense. 

“Please be quiet, you two,’’ 
Jacko said patiently. 

“I haven’t had a drink for 
weeks.” Shrug’s mouth was dis- 
tended with bacon. 

“Like a pig. He eats like a pig. 



30 



GALAXY 




Drinks like a fish. God, what an 
animal.” 

“I want you to pick up some sail- 
cloth while you’re down in the cor- 
ridors today, Cockade.” Jacko 
spoke quietly; Cockade took her 
eyes off Shrug. “We’ll be needing 
sails soon for the Snow Princess. 
Do you think you can do that?” 
“How’s the boat coming 
along?” asked Switch. 

“Fine. Another few weeks or so 
and we’ll be all set to go.” 

Switch stared into the fire. “You 
say it’s — enclosed. I mean, we 
won’t have to be in the open? Like 
a house on skis, you said. You did 
say that, didn’t you, Jacko?” 

“Like a house on skis,” Jacko 
reassured him. “All covered in.” 
“Just outside the spire?” 
“Behind that wall.” Jacko 
pointed. “We’ll knock away a few 
bricks and you can crawl right in. 
No problem.” 

“Oh.” Switch chuckled mirth- 
lessly. “I’m not scared of the out- 
side. But Cockade — you know.” 
The girl looked up from the fire, 
her eyes an artillery of contempt. 

S HRUG walked along the ice 
corridor, his lamp flinging jag- 
ged shadows on the rough-hewn 
walls. Occasionally the rays 
would meet a directly reflective 
surface beyond the range of the 
pool of light and Shrug would see, 
in the ebon distance, an answer- 
ing lamp glowing. And he would 
stop, heart pounding, waving his 



lamp about until the far-off image 
disappeared. Shivering, he 
would then walk on. The tunnel 
was narrow, the roof low — a vein 
in an infinite body of dead life. 

Shrug was imaginative. Shrug 
was scared. 

As he walked he distracted him- 
self with speculation as to the pre- 
sent nature of the small commun- 
ity in the tower. 

Two deaths, not so very long 
ago, had reduced their number 
from six to four. 

Cockade, it seemed, was unable 
to have children. 

The purpose of the community 
was survival. 

Ergo, the community was fail- 
ing. It needed an infusion of life. 
It must increase by recruiting 
new members. 

The word SUPERMARKET, 
distorted by ice, danced in the 
light of his lamp as he trudged by 
thoughtfully. 

A month or two, or maybe a 
year ago, Jacko had conceived the 
notion of the Snow Princess to 
give drive to the group. Shrug was 
not happy about the Snow Prin- 
cess. The more he considered it, 
the less it seemed a good idea. One 
day the Snow Princess would be 
deemed completed. 

And then? 

Shrug screamed with terror, his 
voice multiplying back down the 
tunnel. A man stood before him, 
upright and regarding him, un- 
blinking, through a thin wall of 



SNOW PRINCESS 



31 




ice. As Shrug jerked the lamp, it 
seemed the man winked, slyly. 

The man smiled enigmatically at 
Shrug. He was immaculately 
dressed in a dark suit. He was tall 
and slim. 

T he wind caroled through the 
taut rigging of the small, open 
snowboat. The single triangular 
sail strained forward as Jacko left 
the lee of the spire and raced across 
the snowfields in search of fresh 
meat. He veered and headed east, 
at right angles to the line pre- 
sumed taken by the fleshhunters 
the previous night. 

As he sailed he considered again 
the various factors involved in 
the construction of the Snow 
Princess. 

C ockade and Switch were dis- 
cussing the Snow Princess as 
they prepared to descend to the 
ice corridors. 

“I can’t understand why we 
spend so much time building that 
boat,” Cockade grumbled. “Now 
he wants a sail. Why leave here at 
all, that’s what I want to know. Eh, 
Switch?” 

“The canned food can’t last for 
ever,” her lover replied gloomily, 
for thejoy of disagreement. 

T he snowfield was perfectly flat, 
an infinite expanse covering 
what had once been comparative- 
ly hilly terrain. The snow was 
white and the sky was white and 



the surface flowed with the wind. 
It was difficult to Judge dis- 
tances; the occasional landmark 
would appear suspended in mid- 
air. Jacko maintained his sense of 
direction by reference to the 
wind which had blown from the 
same quarter for as long as he 
could remember. 

■ He came upon the men unex- 
pectedly, about an hour after leav- 
ing the spire. A group of skiers, 
shoulder-sails spread, beating 
aslant the wind and diagonally to- 
ward his own course. He watched 
warily as they approached. He 
reached for his rifle, easing out the 
sail. He aimed to pass some fifty 
yards ahead of them. The craft 
drove on, the snow hissing gently 
under the flat hull. 

“Hi — you!” 

He ignored the cry, surprised 
that it was not accompanied by 
the usual fusillade of shots. Flesh- 
hunters were catholic in their taste 
for meat. 

“Not that way — ” The shout 
came faintly to his ears as he 
swept by. 

They were warning him about 
something. Surprised, he let the 
sail fly loose and the boat slid to a 
halt. He turned and looked around, 
suspecting a trap, but saw only 
the retreating backs of the flesh- 
hunters, shoulder-sails taut as they 
made speed against the wind. 

The snowboat rocked, almost 
imperceptibly. 

Jacko turned to face forward 



32 



GALAXY 




again slowly, cool fear trickling 
down his spine. The sail, flapping 
loose, snatched the rope from his 
fingers. 

A Pad stood at the bows of the 
boat. 

Over nine feet tall, it leaned for- 
ward, huge legs astride, clawed 
forepaws resting on the prow. Its 
silver fur was matted with driven 
snow. Its jaws were parted slight- 
ly, baring sharp teeth in a carica- 
ture of a confidential smile. 

The face of inevitable death 
can often be amusing. 

At the Wine Lodge, in the buried 
village, hung a bright poster. A 
ruddy, benevolent bartender 
leaned his arms on the counter, 
smiling. A tankard of amber beer 
stood at his elbow. The caption 
read; “Meet your friends in the 
local pub.” 

Jacko giggled hysterically as he 
prepared for death and the tears of 
mirth turned to ice on his cheeks. 

Still smiling, the Pad began to 
beat its forepaws on the snowboat, 
gently at first, then violently, like 
an idiot child. 

Then it reached down, gripped 
the keel, and threw the craft up- 
ward and backward, a gesture of 
bored rejection. 

Cold and darkness closed over 
.lacko. The upturned boat lay cov- 
ering him. To his right was a strip 
of gray daylight. He saw the huge 
splayed feet of the Pad, planted pa- 
tiently as it waited for him to em- 
erge. 



S HRUG pounded up the tunnel, 
the lamp swinging wildly, his 
sense of direction lost as he put 
mindless distance between him- 
self and the immaculate, living 
corpse. He sobbed as he ran and in 
the whirling, flashing reflections 
from the ice-walls the man was ev- 
erywhere, materializing in each 
trick of the light, in each irreg- 
ularity of the crudely hewn ice, 
recreated endlessly by the fertile 
fears of Shrug’s own mind. 

The floor was slippery as he 
stumbled on, feet flying, and sud- 
denly the man was before him, 
bathed in light, face distorted and 
terrible, racing toward him mad- 
ly. Shrug screamed again as he 
tried to stop, to turn, failed, and 
crashed into the unyielding arms 
of his own rellection. 

He lay on the cold ice, shudder- 
ing, feeling his heart thudding 
against the hard floor. The lamp 
was out, the dark tunnel silent 
apart from the harsh echo of his 
breathing. 

After a while he moved, felt 
around. He was at the dead end of 
an abandoned tunnel. 

His fingers, groping, encount- 
ered a smooth cylindrical object. 
Exploring farther, he found more. 

Months ago, fearing for Shrug’s 
sanity, Jacko had hidden the en- 
tire stock of the Wine Lodge. 
Presently Shrug drank. 

The wine was contorting. It was 
familiar. Soon Shrug found him- 
self weeping, thinking of his 



SNOW PRINCESS

mother. He felt it was despicable 
that he couldn’t remember what 
she looked like. 

J ACKO’S hand encountered the 
stock of his rifle lying half buried 
in the snow. Grasping it, he wrig- 
gled forward under the upturned 
boat, fighting his way past sack- 
ing, ropes, canvas, away from the 
feet of the waiting "Pad. Before 
long it would occur to the beast to 
pull the boat aside. Jacko didn’t 
want to be around when that hap- 
pened. 

The short mast of the snowboat 
had been driven vertically into the 
snow; he had no way of telling 
whether it was broken. Kicking 
his feet free from entangling 
ropes he crawled under the gun- 
wale near the bows, forcing him- 
self deeper into the soft surface, 
partially concealed by the driv- 
ing mist of fine snow which whip- 
ped across the snowfields. His 
clothing was saturated with death- 
ly cold. 

He stood up clumsily, bringing 
the rifle to bear as his feet sank into 
the yielding surface. 

The Pad’s head swung around. It 
was about fifteen feet away, near 
the stern of the snowboat. 

It regarded him. Its gaze slid 
down to the rifle and back to his 
face. 

Trembling, Jacko hooked his 
numb forefinger around the trig- 
ger. 

There was something about the 



Pad’s eyes. They stared into his, 
willing him not to shoot. The eyes 
were small glowing orbs in the 
huge silver-furred face and they 
held an expression not wholly ani- 
mal. 

Jacko fancied there was an evil 
intelligence behind the eyes. 

The rifle barked, flinging him 
back from his insecure stance. 
Struggling up again, he saw the 
Pad collapsing slowly, ponder- 
ously into the snow, a dark stain 
pumping from its chest. It 
watched him, all the way, until its 
head dropped and was finally still, 
a silver island in the white, drift- 
ing sea. 

Jacko crawled back to the snow- 
boat, dragged boards from be- 
neath the hull, stood on them, 
thrust his fingers under the gun- 
wale and heaved, grunting. The 
side of the boat lifted a foot or so, 
then stuck, held by the buried mast. 

Beyond, white shapes ap- 
proached, unhurriedly. 

Fear pumped adrenalin through 
Jaco’s veins. He lifted again des- 
perately, pain flaring in his back. 
The craft hesitated, then rolled up- 
right, spilling snow. He leaped in, 
seizing the ropes, hauling the sail 
tight, jumping and bouncing fran- 
tically to unstick the snowboat 
from the clinging snow. Slowly, 
very slowly, the craft slid for- 
ward. He remembered his rifle, 
made a grab for it and missed. 

The giant, shaggy shapes were 
all around him, lumbering for-

GALAXY 




ward intently, converging in 
united hatred. He jerked the ropes 
fast and stood brandishing' a 
stick, striking at the razor-sharp 
claws as they swung. He kicked at 
the tiller as he fought, steering a 
jagged, rocking course through 
the pack. A blow from an enor- 
mous paw smashed him to the floor 
of the boat. He huddled, his arms 
about his head, waiting. 

After a while he raised his eyes 
and looked out over the stern. 
Some thirty Pads watched him 
motionlessly as the wind drove 
the snowboat to safety. Shudder- 
ing with reaction, he steered a 
wide arc and made for home. 

A new factor had entered the 
fight for survival. The Pads had 
begun to hunt in packs. Once soli- 
tary prey for his rifle, they had now 
become aggressors. 

II 

C ockade and Switch trudged 
along the ice corridor, dragging 
the supply sledge. They halted out- 
side the supermarket, left the 
sledge and climbed through the 
shattered plate-glass door. In the 
light of their lamps the cavernous 
interior looked bleak and unin- 
viting; most of the shelves were 
empty and the floor was littered 
with torn cardboard wrappings. 
They shuffled through the mess to 
the storeroom at the rear of the 
shop. 



“There’s not a lot left.” 

“Salmon,” said Cockade, 
dragging a case from beneath a 
pile of rubbish. 

“Tomatoes. Didn’t the Old Man 
teach you to read?” 

Cockade pondered and eventu- 
ally remembered the Old Man. 
Once a passive, if instructive mem- 
ber of the community, he had been 
dead for several months. 

“Jacko killed the Old Man,” he 
said. 

“Jacko tried to save the Old 
Man. You wanted to kill him.” 

“Did I?” 

“You said he was a parasite.” 

“Well, I was right, wasn’t I? If 
we’d killed him there would be 
more food here now,” Cockade 
pointed out. 

“The Old Man taught us a lot.” 

“What good has it done you?” 
Cockade kicked around dis- 
piritedly, shuffling among the 
piles of empty cases for something 
edible. 

“1 know that’s tomatoes, don’t 
I?” 

“What’s the difference? We'll 
eat it just the same It doesn’t 
seem there’s anything else here. 
We’ll be hungry tomorrow, un- 
less Jacko’s got a Pad.” 

Switch felt the recurrence of a 
nagging worry which had grad- 
ually intensified over the last few 
weeks. 

“What about the day after to- 
morrow?” he asked. 

She looked at him. In the glow 



SNOW PRINCESS

of the lamp her thin face looked 
vulpine. Switch shuddered pri- 
vately at her expression and his 
hand moved involuntarily to- 
ward his knife. “We'll find anoth- 
er supermarket,” she said and 
suddenly she was Cockade 
again, his lover, helping him col- 
lect the supplies as she always 
did. Switch relaxed. 

“Let’s look right away,” he sug- 
gested. “Some of those old tunnels 
that were here when we came. 
We’ve never explored them pro- 
perly.” 

They left the sledge loaded with 
the single case of tomatoes and 
set off down the corridor, past the 
succession of doorways. 

“I wonder where Shrug is,” 
Switch speculated. 

“I think he went to the tailors. 
Not before time, too.” 

They paused at the entrance to 
the tailors. The ice had been chip- 
ped away around the door; the win- 
dows were opaque. As Cockade 
swung the lamp to peer inside she 
giggled suddenly. 

“Look at that. Switch!” 

A tailor’s dummy stood in the 
window, tall and beautifully 
clothed, smiling fixedly, an en- 
tombed dinosaur of ancient fash- 
ion. 

“Do you suppose Shrug will look 
like that when he’s finished in 
here?” The thought of the filthy, 
bearded Shrug impeccably clad in 
shirt, tie and lounge suit was too 
much. Cockade laughed aloud, a 



jeering resonance in the confined 
space. 

Grinning, Switch accompanied 
her into the shop. For a while they 
poked around, examining clothes, 
exploring the changing cubicles. 
Ugly cracks in the walls bore wit- 
ness to the pressure of ice outside. 

“He’s not here.” Cockade 
voiced the obvious. 

’’Funny.” 

“I don’t think there are any 
more food shops along this way, 
either. Let’s get back.” 

Switch was about to agree when 
the situation struck a chord in his 
memory. Shrug had been lost in 
the tunnels once before and Jacko 
had been furious when he had ar- 
rived back at the tower to find that 
no search had been organized. 
Added to which, they had found 
very little food. Switch did not re- 
lish facing Jacko in the present 
circumstances. 

“Maybe we ought to look 
around a bit more,” he suggested. 

“Shrug is a parasite,” said 
Cockade. “But Jacko would want 
us to look for him. God knows 
why.” 

“We might find some food at the 
same time,” said Switch. 

T hey lifted shrug to his feet and 
held him while he vomited, 
moaning. 

“Dirty drunken bastard,” 
Cockade grumbled. 

“Saw a man watching me from 
in the ice,” Shrug muttered. 



36 



GALAXY 




“Like the Devil, he looked, white 
and smiling. Oh, God — ” He 
hunched over again, retching. 

“A tailor’s dummy.” Switch 
chuckled. “He was scared by the 
tailor’s dummy.” Long ago 
Switch had had a similar exper- 
ience. 

Shrug looked up. His face was 
pallid and sweaty. His eyes were 
bloodshot. “That was no dummy 
1 saw,” he insisted. “His eyes 
moved I’m sure they moved.” 
But he wasn’t sure, now. His head 
swam dizzily; he had an urge to 
drink himself unconscious. 

“Let’s get back to the tower, for 
Christ’s sake.” Cockade was im- 
patient. She renewed her grip on 
Shrug’s arm and Switch grasped 
him from the other side. The lamp 
slipped from Switch’s hand, clat- 
tered to the floor and went out. 

“Bugger it,” muttered Switch in 
the sudden darkness. 

Shrug whimpered. “Damn, 1 
can’t see. My eyes — I can’t see — ” 

“Shut up. What the hell have 
you done, Switch?” 

“I’ve dropped the lamp, of 
course. What the hell do you 
think?” 

“He’s dropped the lamp.” Cock- 
ade’s voice was acid with sar- 
casm. “Nothing to worry about. 
It happens all the time. Tell me. 
Switch, how do you suggest we get 
back? I mean, you’re in charge of 
operations now.” 

There was a pause before 
Switch spoke. “It seems to be 



broken. It won’t go on. Wait a 
moment. I think I’ve got some 
matches.” 

“He thinks he’s got some 
matches. Resourceful.” 

A dim glow illuminated the ice 
walls. 

“That’s not going to do much 
good.” 

Switch’s voice, hoarse with 
alarm: “I haven’t lit it yet.” 

The glow intensified. It seemed 
to have no source; it was all around 
them, green and spectral. They 
clung together in fear — even 
Shrug’s eyes cleared and he stared 
at the ice wall with horror. 

“Look — ” 

Deep within the ice was 
movement, a black shifting, a 
vague shape in the emerald glow. 
They watched as it grew, extended 
itself weirdly in blurred fingers 
of darkness and suddenly the en- 
tire wall was alive, dancing light 
and shadow as a blazing illum- 
ination appeared. 

They looked at each other, faces 
crimson bright and terrified, then 
with one accord they turned and 
ran back down the ice corridor, 
cannoning from wall to wall and 
clawing at each other to reach the 
safety of darkness. 

W HEN eventually they reached 
the spire they found Jacko 
stamping the snow off his boots. 
He paused in the act of shrugging 
off his overcoat, astonished as 



SNOW PRINCESS

they pounded up the stairs and 
flung themselves to the floor, sob- 
bing for breath. 

“What goes on?” he asked. 

Switch recovered first. “There’s 
a ghost in the tunnels,” he gasped. 
Memories of his childhood came 
back. “A bogyman. A great big 
black- it was enormous!” The ef- 
fort of description was too much. 
He subsided, panting. 

“A Pad?” asked Jacko sharply. 

“We know a Pad when we see 
one,” Cockade said. “This was 
black, all sorts of shapes, twisted 
like. And there was a light with it. 
Pads don’t have lights. And it was 
in the ice.” 

Jacko regarded them thought- 
fully. They had seen something, 
that much was certain. But there 
was no way for a Pad to enter the 
ice corridors. 

“What’s up with Shrug?” he 
asked suddenly. 

“He’s had a shock,” Cockade 
replied hastily. “He’s not him 
self.” 

Jacko bent down and sniffed at 
the prone figure. “He’s been drink- 
ing. You’ve let him start drinking 
again.” 

“We couldn’t help it, Jacko,” 
Switch whined. “We found him 
like that.” 

“You damned fools,” Jacko said 
quietly. “I go away for a morn- 
ing’s hunting — for the good of us 
all — and I come back and find this. 
I sometimes wonder why I both- 
er. How many times have I told 

38 



you to keep him away from li- 
quor?” 

Cockade and Switch clung to- 
gether guiltily, eyeing Jacko ner- 
vously as he towered above them. 

“You wouldn’t leave us, Jacko?” 
asked Switch. 

The tall man shrugged and 
turned away, flinging his overcoat 
into a corner. “Get any food?” he 
asked. 

A long silence built. At last 
Cockade answered. 

“There- didn’t seem to be any, 
Jacko.” 

“No cans? You mean every- 
thing’s gone? There are other shops 
beside the supermarket, you 
know.” 

“Yes, well we were just going to 
look when suddenly we saw 
the -thing. It scared us. We ran,” 
Switch explained eagerly. “I’m 
sure there’s plenty down there, 
really, Jacko.” 

“And if there isn’t we can all sail 
away in the Snow Princess,” added 
Cockade, anxious to please. 

Abruptly Jacko strode to the 
steps. “Come on, you two,” he 
commanded. “We’re going down. 
I want to find out what’s happen- 
ing down there. I can’t depend on 
your stories, that’s obvious.” 

Leaving Shrug asleep on the 
floor, they descended the steps to 
the ice corridors. 

S HRUG’S body flew, divided. He 
was soaring above the snowfields 
into the white sky — up, up — and 

GALAXY 




suddenly the sky was blue and the 
white was all below. The many 
parts of Shrug, each one conscious 
of its collective entity, wondered 
at the blueness of the sky which 
was the exact color depicted on 
the label of Fine Old Vatted Ja- 
maica Rum. The many Shrugs 
had never seen the sky before but 
knew what to expect, and present- 
ly were winging their way toward 
the huge figure of the Man With 
One Leg with the green feathered 
creature on his shoulder. 

“Pieces of eight!” cried the 
green one and disappeared, leaving 
the Old Man lying on his back be- 
fore the upturned hat full of scar- 
let snakes. The Old Man’s lips were 
moving. Shrug gathered around 
him and saw that he had Jacko’s 
face. 

Jacko said, “I’m worried about 
the Pads. They’re acting strange- 
ly” 

Shrug felt deeply obligated when 
he heard this; his contribution 
toward his comrades’ welfare 
had been little enough as it was, so 
he said, “Yes, Dad — ” saluted and 
divided again. Climbing astride 
twelve bottles of Beefeater Gin he 
swarmed into the sky once more, 
grateful for their willing assis- 
tance. 

Flocking low over the snowfields 
he spotted the Pads; there were a 
large number so he divided fur- 
ther and blended with them. He 
comprehended. He thought as 
they thought . 



Forward, together. Toward the 
wind. Meat 

The meat with the large 

Shell. 

Dodging, swerving, oh, 
HUNGER. 

Gone. 

Gone into the wind. 

So into the wind for meat. 

Together. 

Together I ... we ... as ONE, 

All into the wind. 

Slowly, slowly Shrug collected 
himself into one consciousness, 
became aware of the hard floor, 
opened his eyes, groaned, heard his 
own voice and began painfully to 
climb to his feet. 

The bell-tower was empty; the 
fire burned low. He staggered 
across the room and threw some 
dry sticks into the upturned bell. 

His head ached fiercly. He 
climbed the ladder and strapped 
on a pair of skis. 

J ACKO strode along the ice-cor- 
ridor swinging the lamp while the 
other two trotted behind like 
curs. 

“Exactly where did you see this 
thing?” he asked. A new rifle hung 
from his shoulder, slapping his 
hip as he walked. 

“Along here, Jacko. Along here. 
Right where you hid the liquor.” 
Switch pointed eagerly, a nervous 
gun dog. 

“Got your picks?” 

“Yes — yes — ” 



SNOW PRINCESS 



39 




“Guns loaded?” 

“Yes.” 

“Nothing to be scared of then, is 
there?” 

“Not a thing. Not a thing.” 
Nevertheless Switch remained a 
couple of paces behind Jacko. He 
laughed meaninglessly. 

Cockade slowed as Jacko 
walked up the final stretch of the 
dead-end corridor. “Look — ” she 
said suddenly. “I’m scared. 1 
don’t mind who knows it. I’m 
scared waterless. Jacko!” she 
cried after the retreating lamp. 
“Let’s go back. Jacko — ” Sudden- 
ly she realized she was alone in the 
dark and dashed forward, only to 
collide heavily with Switch run- 
ning back. They, clung together, 
shivering. Waves of mutual ter- 
ror engulfed them. 

“Let’s get out of here,” mut- 
tered Switch. 

“What’s that?” Cockade 
shrilled. A deep thudding boomed 
along the corridor. 

“It’s the thing!” wailed Switch, 
psycho with fear. “It’s breaking 
through — it’s got Jacko.” 

There was a clear splintering 
crash and the tumbling sound of 
falling debris. 

Whimpering with terror, the two 
rushed back toward the tower. 

«WE FOUGHT,” breathed 

■■ Switch, gazing into the fire. 
“God, how we fought.” His 
knuckles whitened at the recollec- 
tion. 



“It was terribly strong,” Cock- 
ade added. 

“What did it look like?” 
asked Shrug. 

“Big. Huge.” 

“But Jacko had a rifle?” 

“He didn’t stand a chance. It 
was on him before he could 
move.” Cockade could visualize 
the entire scene. She shuddered. 
“I feel there’s something we ought 
to have done,” she said. “But it was 
too late. We barely saved our- 
selves.” 

“So it’s still down there.” 

“It can’t get into the tower. We 
bolted the door.” 

Shrug got to his feet. “You don’t 
think it might batter its way 
through?” 

Cockade thought. “The door’s 
oak,” she said. “Where are you 
going?” 

“I’m going to unlock the door,” 
replied Shrug carefully. 

“What are you talking about?” 
Switch looked up in sudden alarm. 

“Listen to me, you two.” Shrug 
spoke quietly. “While you were 
fooling about below 1 went out- 
side to clear my head. Over the far 
side of the village I came across a 
roof just level with the surface. 
There was a broken skylight. I 
looked inside. I saw clothes and a 
heap of stores.” 

“People?” asked Switch wonder- 
ingly. 

“1 didn’t see anyone. But I be- 
gan to think. I thought about what 
we saw in the tunnel. And then I 



40 



GALAXY 




knew what it was. It was the shad- 
ow of a man carrying a lamp 
along another corridor. That’s 
all. No ghost. No monster. Just a 
man.” 

“He could be dangerous,” ven- 
tured Cockade. 

“He arrived last night,” con- 
tinued Shrug. “He was being 
chased by flesh-hunters and hid. 
There was very little snow on the 
floor. I don’t think a man the flesh- 
hunters were after is much danger 
to us.” Shrug’s voice hardened. 
“And then you come back here and 
give me this load of cock about a 
monster. 1 tell you what hap- 
pened. You got scared down there 
and you ran. You ran out on Jacko. 
After the way he’s kept our group 
going all this time, after all the 
times he’s risked his skin hunting 
Pads to bring you fresh meat. As 
soon as you think things are get- 
ting rough you run like rats and 
leave him to face them alone.” 

Cockade and Switch stared 
dumbly at each other. For once 
even Cockade had nothing to say. 

Switch descended the stairs and 
unbolted the door. 

HI 

“Breakfast, anyone?” asked 
Cockade gaily, stirring a mess of 
tomatoes in a sizzling puddle of 
rancid fat. 

Switch and Cockade had 
feigned sleep when Jacko and 
Shrug returned from below the 



previous night. Unwilling to face 
the accusations of the others they 
had huddled together in a dark 
corner, snoring ostentatiously. 
Now, with gray daylight shafting 
through the holes in the spire. 
Cockade was trying to make 
amends. 

Jacko stirred and opened an eye. 
Shrug sat up groaning. “What is 
it?” asked Jacko. 

“Tomatoes.” A note of defen- 
sive acidity crept into Cockade’s 
voice. 

“Is that all you could find?” 

“The supermarket’s empty, 
Jacko,” Switch reminded him. 

“We’ll have to find some other 
place, then.” Jacko climbed to his 
feet, scratching. He gently prod- 
ded a sleeping huddle with his toe. 
“Breakfast,” he said. 

Switch and Cockade watched 
warily as the heap of clothing un- 
ravelled itself. Two heads ap- 
peared. A man stood first, kicking 
himself free of the blankets. He 
was well over six feet tall and a 
shaggy mane of dark-brown hair 
fell over his low brow. His piggly 
little eyes, red-rimmed with sleep, 
were set deep in a round, bloated 
face. He looked immensely pow- 
erful, broad-shouldered and prim- 
itive. Switch eyes him nervously. 
He was bigger than Jacko. Then 
his attention turned abruptly to 
the girl. 

She rose from the sea of blan- 
kets like a raven-haired Venus, 
slim and pretty with green eyes in 



SNOW PRINCESS 



41 




a grave, oval face. Her breasts were 
small and firm under a rumpled, 
close-fitting white dress which. 
Switch guessed, she had obtained 
yesterday in the corridors. Her 
legs were strong and beautiful. He 
licked his lips and glanced at Cock- 
ade in involuntary comparison, 
to find her glaring at him furious- 
ly- 

“Hello,” the girl said, smiling 
like a tropical sunrise. “My 
' name’s Mignon. 1 know Jacko and 
Shrug already. Who are you 
two?” 

Cockade sniffed. Switch said, 
hastily, “Switch and Cockade,” 
trying not to goggle too obvious- 
ly- 

“And who’s that?” asked Cock- 
ade, gesturing at the giant. 

“He’s my friend. He’s William 
Charles.” 

Hearing his name, the huge man 
shifted his statuesque stance. 
“William Charles,” he repeated 
thickly, lumbering over to peer 
into the pan. He smacked his lips at 
the sight of food. 

“I think William Charles is hun- 
gry,” observed Mignon. 

T he debate that followed 
breakfast was necessarily con- 
strained and polite at first due to 
the beauty of Mignon and, to a 
greater degree, the size and ob- 
vious strength of William Charles. 
But before long informality crept 
in. 

“He doesn’t say much,” Mig- 



non was informing them, “but 
he’s very strong.” 

She intended this as a justifica- 
tion of his usefulness but Switch 
took it as a veiled threat and be- 
gan to bluster. 

“We’ve got guns here,” he said, 
“and we’re well organized. We’ve 
beaten off attacks before and we 
can do it again. We may not look 
much, but we’re united, by damn.” 
A snigger from Shrug ruined the 
effect. “We will fight them on the 
beaches,” he intoned, recalling a 
favorite monologue of the Old 
Man’s. “In the fields — We will 
never surrender.” 

“Since when have we been 
united. Switch?” asked Jacko mild- 
ly. “Personally, I’m very pleased 
to see Mignon and — ah — William 
Charles. Strength is in numbers.” 
“Where the hell did he get a 
name like that?” asked Cockade. 

“And another thing, we need the 
help of a man like William 
Charles to cut new tunnels. Food’s 
running low. We’ve got to find 
more sources.” 

“Until the Snow Princess is 
ready,” put in Shrug. 

“It’s his name,” explained Mig- 
non. “Just his name. That’s what 
he was calling himself when I first 
met him.” 

Cockade snorted. “It doesn’t 
mean anything and it takes too 
long to say. It won’t do.” She 
stared around aggressively. “I 
propose we call him Bog. Short 
and to the point.” 



42 



GALAXY 




Murmurs of agreement came 
from Jacko and Switch, although 
Mignon’s lips tightened and 
Shrug glanced at Cockade sharp- 
ly. 

“Bog it is, then.” Cockade drove 
the point home. She pointed at the 
giant, having decided by now that 
he was harmless. “Bog.” 

“William Charles,” came the 
slow reply. He indicated Cock- 
ade. “Cock-ade,” he said, not with- 
out difficulty. He thumped him- 
self on the chest. “William,” he 
said. Then he pointed vaguely. 

“William Charles!” exclaimed 
Mignon. 

“Charles!” boomed the giant tri- 
umphantly, gesturing at thin air. 

“What's he mean?” asked 
Switch, staring nervously at the 
area of space indicated, as though 
expecting a materialization. 

“1 speak for both,” explained 
the large men obscurely. 

“It’s one of his little jokes,” said 
Mignon hastily. “He pretends 
there’s two of him. Someone once 
told him he worked like two men 
and he believed — with a name like 
that.” In an unconscious effort 
to attract attention away from 
her protege she walked around the 
room inspecting things, picking 
up items and holding them to the 
light, while the men’s eyes fol- 
lowed her every movement. 

“He’s a nut,” said Cockade 
with conviction. “A raving nut.” 

Mignon’s voice cane tentatively 
from the other side of the room; 



she was examining a stone jar in- 
tently. 

“Maybe Bog would be a better 
name,” she ventured. 

“Much better,” Cockade stated 
definitely. 

“What’s this?” In the flat pause 
which followed Mignon held up 
an oddly shaped piece of wood. 

Shrug answered reluctantly, 
“That’s for the Snow Princess.” 
“Snow Princess?” 

Switch explained. “Our boat. 
Our totally enclosed ketch-rigged 
snow yacht outside. 1 built that 
piece myself — ” pride sounded in 
his voice “exactly according 
to Jacko’s plan. It’s called a knee, 
because that’s the way it’s shaped. 
It’s meant to fit near the bottom. I 
expect Jacko will install it today. 
There’s room for four in the Snow 
Princess,” stated Switch firmly, 
“and it’s enclosed because -be- 
cause ” His voice faltered. 

“Because some of you can’t go 
outside,” supplied Mignon gently. 
“A lot of people are like that.” 
“Yes, and today we start mak- 
ing the sails. The hull’s almost 
complete, Jacko says we’ve only 
got to fit the thwarts and the tran- 
som and the cabin roof and sides, 
and a few other things — ” 

“I’m making the sails,” 
Cockade said. Switch’s voice rose 
to a triumphant crescendo. 

“So we hope to load it up with 
supplies in a week or so, not more 
that a couple of months at the 
most, then away we go!” 



SNOW PRINCESS 



43 




“This I must see,” said Mignon. 
She climbed the ladder slowly, 
but only Switch watched her legs. 
She walked around the gallery, 
looking out through the holes in 
the spire. Switch watched her with 
respect bordering on adoration. 
After his years in the ice corridors 
he respected anyone who could 
stand and look at that terrifying, 
vaulting infinity of white nothing- 
ness outside. Cockade read the 
expression on his face and sniffed. 
Bog stared at the fire. 

Shrug and Jacko watched each 
other. 

Mignon was descending the lad- 
der. She looked at Jacko and there 
was a world of understanding in 
her green eyes. “It’s a wonderful 
boat, Jacko,” she said softly. “I 
only wish it were big enough to 
take Bog and me, too.” 

Jacko expelled a deep sigh. 
“Maybe we can enlarge it,” he 
said. 



S HRUG watched as Bog wielded 
the pick, driving a new tunnel in 
the general direction of the Wine 
Lodge, where it was felt that there 
might be a grocery store. The 
Wine Lodge had been dynamited 
by Shrug several months before 
and cut off from the main warren 
of the tunnels, but now Bog was 
reopening the old route, driving 
a corridor parallel to the prev- 
ious, collapsed one. Shrug was 
positive that the Wine Lodge had 



been part of a block of shops 
hitherto unexplored. 

He had experienced a thirsty 
nostalgia, watching Bog work 
and remembering old times in 
the Wine Lodge, so he had fetched 
a bottle from the cache. He drank 
as he directed operations. 

“A little to your right. Bog,” he 
called cheerfully, wiping his lips. 
“We’re getting out of line.” 

The big man swung the pick, 
chanting rhythmically. 

“Hold it.” Shrug chuckled, feel- 
ing lightheaded. He slid the sledge 
forward and began to shovel the 
loose ice from around Bog’s feet. 
When the sledge was full he seized 
the rope and his lamp and can- 
tered off down an abandoned spur 
he was using as a dump. He sang a 
snatch of echoing song as he 
trotted along, the sledge bumping 
easily behind him, and presently 
he had an idea. 

Returning to the scene of opera- 
tions, he called Bog imperiously 
to a halt. 

“What?” The giant turned 
around, puzzled. He felt he could 
keep this up all day; the exercise 
of his muscles in the pleasant 
company of his new friend gave 
him infinite satisfaction. 

“We’re wasting our time. Bog, 
old pal.” 

“Uh?” 

“What we need — ” Shrug chuck- 
led with anticipation — “Is dyna- 
mite.” 

“Dynamite.” Bog repeated it

slowly, savoring the sound. 

“Blast our way through.” Shrug 
made an expansive gesture. 

“Dynamite!” yelled the giant as 
they hastened back toward the 
hardware shop. Shrug was laugh- 
ing helplessly and after a while, 
sensing the humor of the situa- 
tion, Bog joined in. 

J ACKO and Mignon stood on 
the gallery, looking across the 
snowfields. Jacko was talking. 

“It seems to me that we’ve got to 
get out of here sooner or later. 1 
think there’s plenty more food in 
the village, just waiting to be 
found, but that’s not the point. 
Even with you and Bog joining us, 
the group is too small. We just 
scratch around here until we die. 
To me, that seems pointless.” 
“Where did you think of going?” 
asked Mignon. 

“I’m not sure. That’s the prob- 
lem. We tried it once, you know, 
after a fight with the flesh-hunters. 
We split up and tried to get away. I 
think we were upset at the time be- 
cause one of us had been killed. I 
took the Old Man and went to a 
place where there was no snow, a 
long way from here.” He gestured 
vaguely. “When I got there I 
didn’t like it. And the Old Man 
died. So 1 came back and found the 
others still here. Switch and Cock- 
ade were scared to go out- 
side — they’d lived underground 
for so long.” 

“The Old Man meant a lot to 



you?” she queried understandingly. 

“He did to all of us, I think, al- 
though the others didn’t realize it. 
Keeping him alive provided some 
sort of purpose; we didn’t think 
about ourselves so much. When he 
was dead we just seemed to drag 
along with no aim in life.” 

Until you dreamed up the Snow 
Princess . 

“And recently things have been 
getting worse,” continued Jacko. 
“We haven’t eaten fresh meat for 
weeks. The Pads have got them- 
selves — organized. It worries me. 
They used to be just animals. Now 
they’re something else. I some- 
times think they’re more danger- 
ous than the fleshhunters.” 

“Don’t underestimate the flesh- 
hunters,” Mignon warned him. 
“They’re becoming more of a 
menace than ever. If they had 
caught Bog and me we wouldn’t be 
alive now. They’re hungry. May- 
be they’ve had trouble with the 
Pads, too. A lot of towns upwind 
have got themselves organized, 
like yourselves, only they’re bigger 
than your group. They can defend 
themselves. The flesh-hunters 
leave them alone but attack any 
messengers traveling between 
the towns. That’s what happened 
to Bog and me. We were going 
from Bovey to Moreton to work 
out a deal, a possible link-up. 
They jumped us and we had to run 
downwind. They followed us all 
the way — ” Her voice trailed off 
and she was trembling, reliving 



SNOW PRINCESS 



45 




the horror of the pursuit. 

Jacko placed his hand over hers. 
“I’m glad you came, Mignon,” he 
said sincerely. 

B elow, Cockade and Switch 
were getting restless. 

“I don’t like it,’’ said Cockade. 
“They’re getting too damned 
friendly, those two.’’ She was sit- 
ting on the floor, a canvas sheet 
spread over her knees. She was 
sewing furiously. 

“1 don’t see anything wrong with 
it,’’ observed Switch mildly. “It’s 
about time Jacko had a girl.’’ 
“That’s the sort of stupid re- 
mark I’d expect from you,’’ Cock- 
ade snapped. She flung the sheet 
aside and stood over Switch, who 
was planing a strip of plank, sweat 
streaming down his face. 

“What do you mean?’’ he asked, 
aggrieved. 

“Just this.’’ She seized a hand- 
ful of hair, jerking his head back. 
His astonished face peered into 
hers. “There’s only room for four 
in the Snow Princess.’’ She thrust 
four fingers under his nose. 
“Four, you understand?’’ 

“I know that.’’ 

“Jacko’s up on the gallery with 
that girl. Shrug’s in the tunnels 
with Bog. Tell me. Switch,’’ she 
hissed the expression on her 
face frightened him “which are 
the odd two out?” 

Comprehension dawned. “Us,” 
he replied simply. 

“Us,” she repeated. Her eyes 



narrowed. “Switch, if we don’t go 
in the Snow Princess, then no- 
body goes.” 

“What do you mean? What are 
you going to do?” 

“You’ll see.” Abruptly she 
released him and turned away as 
Jacko and Mignon descended the 
ladder. “What have you two been 
up to?” she asked. 

“Just showing Mignon around.” 

“Bog’s in the tunnel with 
Shrug.” 

“I know that. How’s the sail 
coming along?” 

Cockade’s reply was drowned by 
a shuddering concussion that 
boomed through the tower, caus- 
ing the dirt on the wooden floor to 
dance like fleas on a griddle. As 
the four regarded each other in 
alarm a fierce gust of wind swept 
up the stairs, swirling with it an as- 
sortment of cardboard cartons 
and tattered pieces of wrapping 
paper. A lamp overturned, spill- 
ing a spreading dark pool on the 
floor; it ignited explosively, add- 
ing leaping flames and flickering 
shadows to the general confusion. 

Jacko was the first to pull 
himself together. “Mignon, 
Cockade!” he shouted. “Put that 
out, quick. Switch, come with me.” 
He plunged down the stairs, fol- 
lowed, after a second’s pause, by 
Switch. 

Mignon flung sacking on the 
blaze, partially smothering it. 

Cockade watched. A thin tongue 
of flame licked at the half-finished 



46 



GALAXY 




sail. The material blackened. 
Sparks trickled around the edges 
of the canvas. 

Cockade thought. 



«¥T SEEMED a good idea,” 
^ mumbled Shrug, abashed. 
“You’ve brought down the 
whole of that section of tunnel,” 
Jacko accused. “You’ve wasted a 
day’s work and more. You’ll have 
to start again, tomorrow.” 

“Start again,” repeated Bog. 
“Anything you say, Jacko,” 
Shrug agreed. 



H e spun into the sleep of al- 
cohol. Unbidden thoughts 
danced through his mind. It seemed 
he was standing on thick, strong 
legs and he felt good. The wind 
was cold and refreshing and the 
pit into which he gazed was deep 
with promise. Shrug spoke with 
his mind to his fellows as they 
grouped with him and, as he spoke, 
it was as though they spoke as 
one in a communal murmur of 
agreement. 

Now? 

Now! 



C ockade lay awake, watch- 
ing the tapering roof of the 
spire as the light from the dying 
fire sprinkled its last rays among 
the ancient timbers. 

“Switch?” she called softly. 



There was no reply from the 
sleeping form beside her. 

Silently she wriggled out of the 
blankets. 

IV 

ttOORRY about this. Bog,” 

Oshrug said softly. 

“Okay,” replied the giant brief- 
ly, surveying the pile of ice boul- 
ders. They rose steeply in a vast 
tumbled heap at the end of a short 
corridor, terminating far above 
at a ragged line of pale sky. Wisps 
of snow drifted down, funneled by 
an icy wind. 

“We blew right through to the 
surface,” said Shrug wondering- 
ly and a cold half-memory caused 
him to shiver. He had known the 
extent of the explosion before 
seeing it this morning. Yester- 
day they had taken shelter while 
awaiting the blast — then the in- 
furiated Jacko had stormed past, 
examined the pile of rubble brief- 
ly in the dim lamplight and re- 
turned to find them cowering 
guiltily in the supermarket. He 
had whisked them straight back to 
the tower and they had hardly 
discussed the matter. Yet this 
scene was familiar. 

“Start?” asked Bog, swinging his 
pick at the ice-wall. 

“Right,” said Shrug. This 
looked as good a place as any. 
They would have to take a wide arc 
around the rubble to avoid the 
fractured, insecure ice in the im- 



SNOW PRINCESS 



47 




mediate vicinity — no big problem. 

Bog commenced his chant; the 
chips of ice flew. 

“Hold it.” Shrug heard a rolling 
cascade and feared that Bog was 
bringing down the ceiling. A 
chunk of ice bounced across the 
floor, glancing off his ankle. Puz- 
zled, he walked a few paces to the 
scene of the explosion. The steep 
slope of ice boulders was in drib- 
bling motion, smaller pieces 
bounding down the slope and roll- 
ing away along the corridor. 

He looked up and his heart 
chilled. 

Climbing down the avalanche of 
ice, backward, its huge hindquar- 
ters blotting out the sky, was a 
Pad. 

“Bog!” he croaked. He turned to 
run, stopped abruptly, his feet 
sliding. 

In the feeble light of the lamp 
Bog was wrestling silently with a 
giant Pad. 

Shrug watched helplessly as they 
fought. The animal had wrapped 
its forepaws around Bog’s body; 
the man had both palms under the 
bearlike muzzle, thrusting back- 
ward. The Pad overtopped even 
Bog by almost two feet. Its tiny 
eyes gazed wickedly at Shrug 
over Bog’s head. It grunted with 
rage as it forced the man’s hands 
down and Shrug could smell its 
breath; animal, like a putrid car- 
cass. Bog’s coat had been ripped 
apart; his bare back bled around 
the Pad’s bladelike claws, stain- 



ing the silver fur a bright crimson. 

Shrug found himself battering 
ineffectively at the beast’s head 
with a pick; in the confined space 
he was unable to get a full swing. 
He was sobbing with fear and 
frustration, while Bog grew 
weaker. The giant’s eyes were 
creased with strain and agony. 

“Run, friend,” he panted. “1 
win! I win!” 

Shrug was aware of a final cas- 
cade of ice as the second Pad ar- 
rived. It moved into the glow, its 
bulk filling the tunnel, and 
watched the struggle with glowing 
eyes, seeking its chance to feast on 
the kill. Shrug slipped past the 
combatants and cowered in the 
reeling shadows as the fight 
swayed above him. 

Bog was groaning with pain as 
the Pad’s grip tightened and its 
claws bit farther through his flesh. 
The animal snuffled with excite- 
ment, its muzzle an inch from the 
man’s face. It smelled blood and 
its jaws streamed saliva, steaming. 

“Run, my friend,” Bog whis- 
pered. Shrug heard and wept im- 
potently. 

Sudden inspiration prized his 
brain from the clutch of fear and he 
acted. Seizing the lamp, he 
smashed it over the Pad’s great 
head. Fuel poured down the brute’s 
shoulders and exploded into 
flame. 

The corridor flashed into 
luminescence, the Pad’s blazing 
head stared at Shrug from every re- 



48 



GALAXY 




flective surface. As it staggered 
away he caught Bog around the 
waist and half dragged, half car- 
ried him down the tunnel. The oth- 
er Pad, alarmed, backed toward 
the ice-fall. Shrug struggled on 
and soon a corner hid the inferno. 

As Shrug assisted Bog toward 
the tower he heard gruntings and 
snafflings around them as count- 
less Pads prowled the dark shops 
restlessly, aroused and somehow 
sharing the pain and terror of their 
brother. The tunnels were alive 
with the brutes, which must have 
been drowsing in the shops when 
he and Bog had made their way to 
the ice-fall. 

Shrug and Bog reached the oak 
door at the entrance to the tower. 
Shrug thrust the big man inside 
and turned at a sudden radiance 
in the tunnel behind him. The 
blazing Pad appeared in the dis- 
tance, head and shoulders a corona 
of fire repeated down the ice cor- 
ridors in a thousand grotesquely 
distorted reflections. The ani- 
mal was screaming in a crescendo 
of pain; it fell to the floor and beat 
at the ice with its paws in terminal 
agony. 

As Shrug slammed the heavy 
door and threw the bolt he heard a 
great keening groan as a multi- 
tude of animal voices mourned the 
death of a comrade. 

t^VOU’VE really done for us 

* now, you drunken sod,” 
whimpered Cockade as she lis- 



tened fearfully to the battering of 
heavy bodies against the door be- 
low. “You’ve let them in the back 
way. After all our work, fortify- 
ing the place.” 

Mignon looked up from bandag- 
ing Bog's wounds. “That’s unfair,” 
she said. “Shrug couldn’t have 
known.” 

“In any case,” said Switch con- 
fidently, “We can rig a 
temporary sail on the Snow Prin- 
cess and get away. Cockade and I 
in the cabin, and the four of you 
outside.” 

“We can’t move Bog,” objec- 
ted Mignon. 

“The Snow Princess isn't 
finished yet,” said Jacko. 

“Not even so we could go slow- 
ly?” pleaded Switch desperately. 

“I'm afraid not.” 

Cockade watched them narrow- 
ly, the sickness of frustration in 
her stomach. 



D uring the night she had 
mounted the steps to the gal- 
lery, carrying a can of lamp fuel. 
She had made the Journey sever- 
al times, quietly, keeping an eye 
on the sleeping mounds on the 
floor. 

The gallery wasn’t so bad in the 
dark. The force of the wind was 
disturbing as it blasted through 
the holes in the spire, but not terri- 
fying; and she was unable to see 
the tossing white emptiness 
which, in the daylight, filled her 



SNOWPRINCESS 



49 




with unreasoning panic. 

She took up her position at a 
hole directly above a certain 
point in the tower wall; the point 
at which, Jacko said, the Snow 
Princess lay outside. Her idea 
was simple and basic. If she and 
Switch were not going on the 
Snow Princess, neither was any- 
one else. She would pour fuel over 
it and light it. 

She struck a match experi- 
mentally, with trembling fin- 
gers, threw it out of the hole. The 
wind swirled it away, extinguished. 

She struck another. 

And another. 

She was sobbing with frustra- 
tion. She struck match after match. 

The box was empty. The cans, 
unused, stood at her feet. In her 
rage she kicked them. She heard 
someone stir below. 

B OG’S wounds were dressed; he 
lay with closed eyes, his breath- 
ing shallow. Jacko, Mignon and 
Shrug made for a ladder. The din 
from below was increasing; 
blows on the oak door were ac- 
companied by splintering sounds. 

“Could we make it in the snow- 
boat, Jacko?” asked Shrug quiet- 
ly- 

“I don’t think so. It’d get bogged 
down with the weight. But it may 
be the only chance we have. We 
could cover Switch and Cockade 
with blankets and Bog could steer 
lying down. The other three 
would have to go on skis. That still 



means three in the snowboat. It’s 
only built for one. And how do we 
get Bog up the ladder and out- 
side?” 

They climbed to the gallery and 
looked out at the swirling white- 
ness. They saw the chasm in the 
snow, a deep fissure away to their 
left. A hundred yards downwind a 
horde of young Pads gamboled in 
the snow, playful as puppies, 
while their adults prowled the ice 
corridors for fresh meat. Ten feet 
below the hole in the spire lay 
Jacko’s snowboat. Scattered 
around the lee of the spire, partial- 
ly covered by snow, were the var- 
ious components of the Snow 
Princess, unassembled. 

Grouped around the spire, star- 
ing up with intelligent, hungry 
eyes, waited a tight circle of Pads. 

C ockade and Switch sat at 
the foot of the stone steps lead- 
ing to the bell-tower, watching 
the oak door fearfully. It 
trembled again and again as heavy 
bodies dashed themselves against 
the far side. Fine cracks were 
creeping along the grain of the 
timber. They held rifles and from 
time to time fired at the door, aim- 
lessly. 

“It’s not going to hold for long,” 
muttered Switch desperately. He 
raised his rifle and loosed off a 
round. The stone chamber rang 
with the concussion and bullets 
smacked into the timber. “The 
slugs won’t go through,” he said.

“The door stops gunfire but it’ll 
let in the Pads.” He stood, abrupt- 
ly. “Let’s get out of here. We’ll be 
safer in the tower. What’s keep- 
ing the others, anyway?” 

“Wait a moment,” said Cock- 
ade. Her voice was sharp with sus- 
picion. “You’re right. They’ve 
been a long time up there. You 
know what’s happened? The sods 
have gone! They’ve run out and 
left us down here! They’ve cleared 
out!” She jumped to her feet and 
pounded up the steps. “Are you 
there?” she shouted echoingly into 
the spire. 

Bog, prone on the floor, shifted 
and opened one eye. 

A couple of shots rang out from 
above, then Jacko’s voice. “We’re 
here,” he called, tiredly. 

“Good,” yelled Cockade. 
“Because 1 just thought you might 
have had the notion of buggering 
off with Shrug and your girl friend. 
What the hell are you shooting at? 
You’ll attract the Pads to the 
spire, you damned fool!” 

“They’re already here,” Jacko 
called back. 

Bog spoke from the floor with an 
effort, his face dark with slow 
rage. “Mignon would not bugger 
off,” he said emphatically. 

“You mean we’re surrounded?” 
screamed Cockade. 

“Tm afraid so.” 

“Mignon never buggers off.” 
“Shut up, you ox We’re com- 
ing up!” shrilled Cockade. “1 don't 
believe you!” 



“Stay there. I’ll come down. 
Shrug. You and Mignon wait up 
here for a while. I’ll go and sort out 
those fools below. Our only 
chance is to pick off the Pads as 
they come up the steps. We can’t 
all retreat to the gallery. We’d 
never be able to carry Bog up the 
ladder. Somehow we’ve got to 
drive them off.” 

“1 heard you call us fools!” 
yelled Cockade. 



WrflHERE must be over a hun- 
A dred of them,” said Mignon. 

Shrug was silent for a moment. 
“Do you smell fuel?” he asked sud- 
denly, sniffing. 

“Yes. Look, there are some cans 
around.” 

Shrug leaned out and gazed at 
Jacko’s snowboat. He thought 
about Cockade for a moment. 

He raised his eyes and scanned 
the snowfields. 

He thought about the Pads. Dis- 
connected snatches of memory 
came to him; things Jacko had 
said. Things he had dreamed? 

“Mignon,” he said, “I want you 
to keep me covered. I’m going 
down to Jacko’s boat. Hold the 
Pads off while I’m down there. As 
soon as I’m back, let go the moor- 
ing rope.” He slackened the rope 
which stretched down to the 
tethered craft, dropped the cans of 
fuel out of the hole, took a lamp 
from the gallery floor and climbed 
awkwardly outside. One-handed,

he descended the rough ladder to 
the snow. Above him Mignon’s 
rifle began to bark. 

WIJ IGHT, you two.” said Jacko 
^ authoritively. “I want you 
halfway down the steps, standing 
with your rifles ready. Keep firing 
as they come through the door and 
back up the stairs slowly. Don’t 
panic. Don’t run. Bog?” 

“Yes.” 

“Here, take this rifle. If they get 
past us, pick them off as they reach 
the top of the steps.” 

Painfully Bog shifted his posi- 
tion, lying on his side, the rifle 
held in a single hand. 

T here was a final, splintering 
crash and the heavy oak door 
split at the hinges and fell into the 
chamber, slamming flat to the 
floor as an enormous Pad bowled 
through, head over heels, in a whirl 
of white fur and scrabbling claws. 
Jacko’s rifle cracked out and the 
animal lay still. 

Grunting and roaring, the pack 
surged at the doorway and 
jammed for an instant while 
Jacko, Switch and Cockade rained 
bullets among them. The screams 
of agony were nearly human as 
several Pads sank to the floor. 
Those behind climbed their com- 
rades, jaws agape and drooling as 
they spotted the trio on the steps. 
An animal stink pervaded the 
chamber. 

“Start backing up!” yelled 



Jacko, dropping the leading Pad 
as it bounded up the stairs. It 
reeled back among the others and 
in the confusion Switch felled an- 
other with a bullet in the throat. 

Cockade had dropped her rifle; 
knuckles to her mouth she bit 
back a scream when another Pad, 
rearing huge, spun away, roaring 
as blood gushed from its stomach. 

By now the chamber was full of 
Pads and still they crammed 
through the doorway, forcing 
themselves up the stairs by weight 
of numbers. Jacko and Switch 
backed up slowly, firing con- 
tinuously into the seething, strug- 
gling white mass. Roars and 
screams indicated they were 
striking home, but the numbers 
were too great. 

Jacko found himself at the top 
of the stairs. “Run for it, you 
two!” he shouted. “Up the ladder, 
quickly!” 

The command was unneces- 
sary; Switch and Cockade had 
bolted. Flinging their rifles aside, 
they were scrambling up to the 
gallery. Jacko took up position 
for a final stand, rifle at the ready, 
legs straddling Bog. 

The leading Pad bounded up the 
stairs, saw the two men, reared on 
hind legs and crossed the bell-tower 
in four strides, ignoring the bul- 
lets which smacked into its body. 
It stood before Jacko; it swept his 
rifle aside contemptuously, 
with a massive paw. 

Jacko regarded the Pad. 



52 



GALAXY 




This is the finish, he thought. 

And in the instant of thinking, 
suddenly he knew that this was 
not the finish. 

Because the Pad’s reaching fore- 
paws froze, then dropped to its 
sides. It paused irresolute as 
.lacko stared into its eyes. Bullets 
lore into its body from above — but 
still it stood there for a timeless 
moment, while behind it the other 
Pads hovered, watching, not 
moving. 

Then it turned away; they all 
turned. Slowly at first, almost 
thoughtfully, they ambled back 
to the top of the stairs, then in 
gathering haste they descended, 
falling over one another, 
scrambling in their eagerness to 
leave the bell-tower. They uttered 
strange mewing sounds, somehow 
quite touching. 

They were gone. The bell-tower 
was empty. 

. Jacko climbed the ladder. 

Switch and Cockade sat on the 
floor of the gallery. Shrug and 
Mignon were looking outside, 
spellbound. 

The bleak snowfields were alive 
with fleeing Pads. They had left the 
spire; they raced bounding across 
the snow kicking mist, they scram- 
bled out of the fissure, treading 
on one another in their haste to 
join the pack; over a hundred of 
them, racing downwind. 

Pursuing a glowing crimson 
fireball. 



S HRUG had hurried away; soon 
he rejoined them, rubbing his 
hands as a dull concussion 
thudded through the tower. 

“Just a little explosion this 
time,” he said happily. “Enough 
to seal the gap. They won’t get in 
that way again.” 

Cockade was crying, apologiz- 
ing for all things she had done, 
quite a number of which were un- 
clear to the others. 

“Forget it,” said Shrug. “You’ll 
feel better in the morning. You’ll 
be back to normal, unfortunate- 
ly-" 

Bog misconstrued Cockade’s 
mumblings. “I said Mignon did 
not bugger off,” he asserted ami- 
ably. “Mignon will never bugger 
away from William Charles. Cock- 
ade does not understand Mig- 
non.” He wrapped a huge arm 
around his slender companion’s 
waist, drawing her down to the 
floor beside him. 

Jacko eyed them, a curious sad- 
ness within him. Mentally he 
shook himself. “You know, 1 
thought if we shot a few, they 
would be satisfied and eat their 
own dead.” 

“Instead you stared them 
down,’’ cried Switch en- 
thusiastically, uplifted in the af- 
termath of battle. “The power of 
the human eye!” 

“Not exactly. You’d better ex- 
plain, Shrug.” 

Unconsciously Shrug puffed out 
his chest. He opened his mouth to

tell them all, then closed it, 
abruptly. 

How could he tell them that he 
had dreamed mad dreams while 
under the influence of hard 
liquor, and had deduced from 
these and their parallel with sub- 
sequent events that the Pads were 
telepathic to a degree? That he, 
when his mental barriers were sub- 
merged in alcohol, could pick 
them up? Cockade would laugh at 
him forever. 

Go on, have another drink. 
Shrug, and tell us what the Pads 
are thinking. A good excuse for a 
bottle or two, eh. Shrug? No . 

"Jacko and 1 noticed the Pads 
have started acting together, like 
ants, as if they were one body in- 
stead of several," he explained at 
last. “They’ve gotten organized. 
They think as one. 

"They were in the tunnels and 
around the tower, encircling us. 
That takes some sort of intelli- 
gence. They can’t speak, so there 
must be something else—” He 
warmed to his theme. “Anyway, 
downwind were their young.” He 
stabbed the air, reliving the scene, 
and so great was his capture on 
their imaginations that all eyes 
followed his dramatic finger. 
“And below was the boat and 
beside me were some cans of 
fuel.” He grinned unpleasantly at 
Cockade. “So while Mignon cov- 
ered me I hoisted the sail, ignited 
the boat and cast it off. It drove 
straight for the young Pads, blaz- 



ing. They panicked and ran like 
hell, away across the snowfields, 
scattering in all directions. The 
Pads saw this and those that didn’t, 
sensed it. They left abruptly. 
There’s nothing like danger to the 
young, to bring the parents run- 
ning 

Shrug smiled around at them, 
the man of the moment. They re- 
garded him with awe. 

“Well,” he said, “for the small 
sacrifice of Jacko's snowboat ” 

Mignon spoke quickly. “You 
mean the Snow Princess, of 
course,” she corrected him. 

Shrug stared, began to speak, 
thought better of it. 

Jacko smiled slowly. 

“It’s a shame,” continued Mig- 
non, “for all that work on the 
Snow Princess to go up in smoke. 
But it was a small sacrifice when 
you consider the result. We can 
build another. Bog’s quite good at 
that sort of thing. He used to build 
snowboats at Bovey big ones.” 
She grinned at the giant. 

Jacko and Shrug regarded her 
with adoration. With a few words 
she had eliminated the problem 
which had been bothering them 
for weeks. The Snow Princess had 
officially ceased to exist. 

“Don’t need boat,” rumbled Bog 
with a deep laugh. “We have our 
own Snow Princess.” He tight- 
ened his arm around Mignon. 

Cockade, scowling, wondered if 
maybe Bog might not be as stupid 
as he looked. ★

His punishment was to ERNESTTAVES 

destroy a planet that 

was polluting the Universe. 



1 HAVE just been tried in, or by, 
the highest court on the planet for 
what still seems to me a trivial of- 
fense; not always wishing to walk. 
I’d tried to build myself a private 
cruiser, a small one. I had been 
discovered (by means I didn’t un- 
derstand) and that had been that. I 
wait for the three Judges to reap- 
pear. A door opens and I rise as 
they slowly enter. They seem too 
young. Again I admire their gold- 
en robes. I am dressed in the pale 
brown tunic I must wear until my 
sentence is completed. I remain 
standing while the others are seat- 
ed. My features are adjusted in- 
to what I mean to be taken as an 
expression of respect, but con- 
taining nothing of obsequiousness. 

“Musician and Poet Rockwell,” 
the Judge seated between the 
other two says, not unkindly. 
“Your offense is grave. Do you 
wish to say something before sen- 
tence is heard?” 

I return his open gaze with my 
own. “I didn’t — don’t — under- 
stand the gravity of my actions, 
sir.” 

The Judge nods. “Just so. Had 
you understood, you would not 
have committed this crime. There- 
fore our sentence is that you study, 
with Master Clarke of the Third 
Institute, the history of this 
planet and of the Galactic Federa- 
tion; further, that you devote 
some time to observations of Cen- 
tral Control.” 

No time stated, I note. Also, na- 



ture of certain operations not 
stated, but I don’t ask questions. 
The Judge begins to nod in dis- 
missal, then says; “By the way. 
Musician Rockwell — I’m famil- 
iar with some of your perform- 
ances. You have promise.” 

“Thank you, sir,” I say, won- 
dering what’s wrong with the 
poems. 

T he joint Musician and Poet 
category rates purple, a color 
I’m fond of; also, the status value 
of purple robes is high — and I con- 
fess to my share of vanity. Now, 
however, I was declasse, and 
hoped none of my friends would 
take note of me and my tawdry 
garb as I walked, next day, to the 
Third Institute. Master Clarke’s 
robes would, of course, be royal 
green, and you can’t go higher 
than that. I would be at a disad- 
vantage in more ways than one. 

The Master’s quarters were spa- 
cious and scholarly. Shelf after 
shelf of books. Books! I gaped 
when I saw them and there went 
another piece of such face as I had 
left, which now rapidly ap- 
proached zero. I knew what they 
were, but I’d never held one in my 
hand. 

“Yes,” the Master said. “Sur- 
prising, I know. But then I’m a 
hopeless antiquary.” No doubt he 
was, but his study was also filled 
with the most comprehensive ar- 
ray of data terminals, inputs, 
outputs, screens, the whole works.

I’d ever seen. He took a volume 
from the shelf, placed it in my 
hand. I failed to recognize title or 
author. “These are all reconstruc- 
tions, of course. Hard enough to 
find, even so.” He replaced the 
volume. “Name Korsakoff mean 
anything to you?” 

“No, sir.” 

“No reason it should, now. It 
will. No need to stand on cere- 
mony here, son, make yourself 
comfortable. We’ll get to Kor- 
sakoff later.” He pushed buttons 
on an impressive console, hand- 
ed me a crystal glass filled with 
amber fluid and put on the desk 
before him a similar glass, ex- 
cept his contained something 
colorless. Separating the man 
from the boy? The Master from 
my unfrocked self? I didn’t know 
— and I didn’t know if what was 
going on here was by design — but 
I felt as if I had swiftly and skill- 
fully been programed into a con- 
dition of humility. Something 
new in my experience. 

After the Master had raised his 
glass 1 took a sip from mine. 
Something else new in my experi- 
ence; I couldn’t name that potion, 
but whatever it was, it was good. I 
sensed the occurrence of gentle 
internal events, I felt coopera- 
tive and friendly. Well — Masters 
aren’t Masters for nothing. 

“Why did you want to build your 
own cruiser?” he asked, and that 
was the beginning of a long ses- 
sion. Not too long, though, be- 



cause the glasses were refilled at 
suitable intervals, and I was glad 
of that. I explained how it was that 
I didn’t like to walk, and wanted a 
cruiser, a small one, of my own. 

“But you can always dial one. 
You wouldn’t have to wait long, 
usually,” he said, and 1 said that 
was true — but somehow it wasn’t 
the same. I’d wanted one of my 
own. And you sometimes did have 
to wait for a public cruiser and 
sometimes you even had to share 
it. While we talked, everything we 
said was, of course, fed into multi- 
ple inputs. 

“Why do you think, son Rock- 
well, we have only public cruis- 
ers? Why is their number most 
controlled?” he asked. 1 hadn’t 
been called son for years, and I re- 
acted to that. 1 confessed that I 
didn’t know. 

“No,” he said, “you don’t 
know,” and he was kind and said 
that my attitude was not unusual, 
the laws had been in effect so long 
that everybody accepted them as 
facts of life. What was unusual 
was my attempted violation of 
the prime law that an individual 
can’t own a cruiser. 

We kicked my motives around 
for quite a bit and that was enough 
for the first day. I felt good when I 
left, though I still didn’t want my 
friends to see me in the brown tun- 
ic.

that — at, specifically, the history 
of this, our planet. 

“Millennia — many of them — 
ago,” the Master said, “the then 
inhabitants of this planet almost 
strangled it. It was a near thing.” 

I said, with genuine humility, 
that I didn’t see the relevance of 
that datum in the present context. 
What had almost killed the planet, 
he said, was a combination of fac- 
tors, by far the largest of which 
had been individual ownership of a 
primitive form of cruiser, whose 
combustion products had polluted 
the atmosphere to the point where 
photosynthesis (he tried to explain 
that to me but I had to do home- 
work on it later) had almost 
ceased — in consequence the human 
species, along with most of the 
other life forms, had almost been 
done in. 

The Master punched the con- 
sole and we looked at pictures 
from that time. All those funny- 
looking cruisers! City streets and 
broad ribbons everywhere filled 
with them. 

“Anybody could have one, own 
one?” 1 asked “Anybody?” 

“Anybody who could afford 
one.” 

“What a time that must have 
been .” 

“Yes. It almost killed the plan- 
et. It was a lousy scene.” 

“Lousy?” 

“Forgive me — I’m afraid I use 
antiquarian language now and 
then. Lousy is an ancient word 



meaning unpleasant, contemp- 
tible, nasty.” 

“I see. But our cruisers, now, 
don’t pollute, do they?” 

“Not much. The prohibition 
of private ownership of them is 
largely symbolic — a reminder, 
to some of us, at least.” 

We went on for a few more 
sessions. 1 could have read it all on 
my own — or most of it — but the 
Master must, he said, be sure 1 un- 
derstood and interpreted cor- 
rectly. I wasn't used to the study 
of history, after all, 1 was a Mu- 
sician and Poet — though my now 
pedestrian raiment denied that. 

After the near-miss with disas- 
ter we had, I learned, pulled up our 
socks and straightened out. One 
government for the whole planet, 
for example — the only way con- 
trols could be effective. Then the 
discovery of hyperspace and, at 
the same time, the flowering of the 
Genetic Era. Two simultaneous 
breakthroughs: intragalactic ex- 
ploration and colonization, and 
genetic manipulation in aid of 
producing Homo sapiens uni- 
versalis, or Homo sapiens sa- 
piens, or whatever. Man sapient, 
that is, but more so. 

A number of psycho-geneticists 
and somato-geneticists had worked 
on the development of better hu- 
man strains, and one of these gen- 
etic dabblers had been Korsakoff. 
Korsakoff had been one of the 
more controversial of the phycho- 
geneticists, not always in favor in

GALAXY 




Ihe scientific community. The so- 
matic problems were, in the end, 
almost trivial, but the physiologi- 
cal and psychiatric ones were not. 

“You have studied all this?” the 
Master asked. I nodded. “So what 
what was the next step?” 

I thought for a moment. “Con- 
duct experiments with the new 
subspecific variants. Get a 
group large enough and dump 
them on an uninhabited planet 
and see how they make out.” 

“Not elegantly said, for a Po- 
et,” the Master said, “but that’s 
about right.” 

He detailed the program. 

It had started millennia past 
and I confess I began to feel a 
sense of awe. Some of the mutants 
had worked out, some not. Some of 
the mutants, off on their own plan- 
ets, had even gone on to construct 
better mutants. We — our planet — 
were still Home, we were the capi- 
tal, for this was where it had all 
started. We and the other planets, 
those that remained sane, formed 
the Galactic Federation — whose 
headquarters were here. 

“What happens to the other 
planets?” I asked — a point in re- 
spect of which my study materials 
had been curiously reticent. 

“That is known only to Mas- 
ters, Scientists and some Judges. 
And to a few others, such as your- 
self, who must be told. You will un- 
derstand, of course, why you must 
be told. There is little in any ar- 
chive on this, so I must tell you. 



And will. You will, of course, 
swear secrecy.” 

I did, and the inputs gobbled 
up my pledge and, no doubt, im- 
printed it upon an array of multi- 
parametered matrices whose 
functions I could only guess at. 

Master Clarke filled our glasses 
then, and this time 1 had what he’d 
always had. Incredible. My 
brain cleared — not that it had been 
fuzzy, but this was something 
else. “It’s only for Masters and 
their — ah — guests,” he said, “so 
don’t become addicted.” 

Then he told me; 

Sensors and transmitters had 
been placed, in isolated and inac- 
cessible locations, on all of the 
experimental planets. The 
sensors monitored planetary at- 
mospheres — for carbon mon- 
oxide, chlorinated hydrocarbons, 
hydrocarbon byproducts, and 
radioactivity. They picked up 
other data also, but these were the 
important ones. The transmitters 
hurtled these data, via hyperspace, 
into Planetary Watch- a top- 
secret facility in Central Control. 

“Most of our citizens believe 
that Central Control is but the 
computer that controls the func- 
tioning of this planet. It is that, of 
course, but is also this. We, the 
Masters, think this is its most im- 
portant function. We shall go 
there now.” 

We continued to talk, voices 
low, as we walked. He spoke of 
what he called the green line. 



INTERSECTGREEN 



59 




“What happens when the read- 
ings hit the green line?” I asked. 

“When the curve — any of 
them — intersects the established 
limit we push a green button and 
destroy the planet. Fusion de- 
vices are in place.” 

“Just like that.” 

“For the greater galactic good, 
yes. Just like that, as you will see.” 
“Along with any other planets 
in that system happening to 
share the general area.” 

“If any, yes. But the chances are 
overwhelming they aren’t inhab- 
ited.” 

“Why is observation of Central 
Control part of my sentence?” 
“You’ll see, son Rockwell. 
You’ll see.” 

T FIE existence of the Planetary 
Watch is unknown to, say, 97% 
of our population. It occupies 
the top floor of Central Control. 
Both palm and voice prints are re- 
quired to open the door of the ele- 
vator that takes you up. “How can 
such an operation be kept secret 
from so many?” 1 asked. “There 
isn’t much curiosity,” the Master 
said. 

He led me into a fairly large 
room, three walls of which were 
covered with a dazzling array of 
screens, readouts, many lights 
blinking on and off. There was a 
console in the center of the room, 
presided over by two Scientists in 
white robes. A third Scientist pa- 
trolled the screens, pushing but- 



tons from time to time, adjusting 
this or that, taking readings, 
making notes. 

We passed through this room 
and through another door in the 
fourth side of the room. “The — I 
believe they call it basic hard- 
ware — is here.” We were in an 
enormous room, now, filled with 
racks and panels, a subtle but 
pervasive hum, and mysteries. 
(I’m not a Scientist. Nor is Master 
Clarke, for that matter.) Large 
cables of many colors were all 
over the place, linking this area to 
that- the arteries, veins, and ner- 
vous system of a monster. 

“The intake receptors are on 
the roof,” the Master siad. “They 
could be here as well, but it’s tradi- 
tional, I’m told, to place them on 
the roof.” We climbed a flight of 
stairs. The roof was covered with 
multihelixed arrays, pointing in 
all directions, covering this 
hemisphere of the sky. “How 
about the other side?” I asked. 

“There’s a similar receptor 
complex over there- or down 
there, straight down from here. It 
feeds into this place by micro- 
wave relay.” We went down the 
stairs, then, and to the console. 

The Master greeted the Scien- 
tists, and introduced me Brown 
Tunic Rockwell. One of the 
Scientists showed me around, the 
Master coming along, inter- 
ested. Each experimental planet 
out there was on display here. The 
elaborate inputs to the large pan- 



60 



GALAXY 




els on the three walls were here 
condensed into digital readouts. 
1 saw that, in most cases, then 
parameters were being mon- 
itored usually to seven signi- 
Cicant figures. Above each digital 
readout was printed, in green, the 
value which must not be exceed- 
ed -the value which said a planet 
was about to die. Each panel bore, 
for each parameter under ob- 
servation, three pilot lights — 
red, yellow, and green. There was 
also a green push button, im- 
mediately below which were two 
spaces for the insertion of keys. 
The button had no label and it 
didn’t need one— -they knew what it 
was for. Almost all of the lights 
were red, a few were yellow. No 
green showing. 

I got it. Red was in the clear, 
yellow was approaching danger, 
and when the green went on you 
turned the keys and pushed the 



green button. Minus one planet. 

“How does Korsakoff Five 
look?” the Master asked. 

“No better. Any day now.” He 
showed us the Korsakoff Five 
panel. There were nine reds, but 
the carbon monoxide showed yel- 
low. The seventh digit was in al- 
most continual change, advancing 
and retreating, but, the Scientist 
said, steadily closing the gap. It 
had about a hundred to go — a 
hundred units in parts per million, 
that is. The first five digits coin- 
cided with the stated limit. 

“You see, Rockwell, why we’ve 
been talking of Korsakoff — his 
fifth planet will amost certainly 
be the next one to go,” the Master 
said. I nodded, and 1 spent sever- 
al hours wandering about the 
room, getting the feel of the place. 
I happened to be standing before 
one display (Wilkinson Four) 
when the radioactivity light

went from red to yellow. A spooky 
feeling. 

I spent a few more days hanging 
around Planetary Watch, and it 
seemed my sentence should be 
served by now, but — not quite. 
During the evening of the third 
day Master Clarke called me and 
told me to meet him at Planetary 
Watch. I did so; he was waiting at 
the elevator when I arrived. He 
palmed the panel and spoke into 
a concealed microphone and up 
we went. A different shift of 
Scientists was on duty now, and 
they were all watching the large 
Korsakoff Five panel on the 
wall. The graphic readout showed 
that the carbon monoxide line 
was about to intersect the line of 
the limit. You could see it hap- 
pening on the digital display at 
the console, of course, but this was 
more dramatic. 

1 watched, hypnotized, as the 
lines did intersect. The yellow 
changed to green, and a gentle but 
persistent tone began to sound. 

“This could be automated, of 
course,” the Master said, “but we 
prefer to do it by hand. Come to 
the console.” We all went. Two of 
the Scientists inserted -with a 
business-like air - their keys into 
the slots beneath the green button 
and turned them a quarter turn. 
Clockwise, I noted. 

“Now,” the Master said,” if 
you will?” He indicated the 
green button. 

“I — ” It seemed too much. 



“This will complete your sen- 
tence,” he said, the Scientists 
standing there watching, listening. 

Well. What do you do when 
asked to blast a planet full of 
people — into subatomic parti- 
cles? In my situation you push a 
button. I did. Nothing happened. 

“In about ten minutes — through 
hyperspace,” the Master said, and 
he and 1 returned to the large dis- 
play on the wall. The Scientists 
went back to their routine. 

“Why do it this way?” I asked, 
having done it. “The planet will 
die anyway.” 

“A dying planet is a bad thing. 
This is more- humane.” 

Silently we watched. Then, al- 
most casually, as if closing up 
shop for the night, the lights went 
out. The polygraphs stopped, and 
ten needles abruptly flopped to 
zero. End. Not knowing what to 
say, I said nothing. 

The Master opened a package 
he’d been carrying. My purple 
robe! I shucked off the detestable 
brown tunic and proudly put on 
the purple. Musician and Poet 
again. We left that place. 

“Korsakoff Five over and done 
with,” the Master said, “It’s real 
name was Terra but we didn’t 
think of it as such.” 1 was anxious 
to be gone, 1 had to practice upon 
my instruments, write some lines. 
“That’s the last one of the lot and 
a good thing too. Korsakoff was a 
lousy geneticist. Good night, 
Rockwell.” ★

THE 

TEACHER 

LARRY EISENBERG 



I T WAS a butterfly, the brightly 
painted wings twinkling over the 
stiff green blades of grass. It hov- 
ered, dipped and finally lighted 
on a faded purple stalk of clover. 
Another butterfly came along 
and another. Each one lighted be- 
side the first until at last there was 
a canopy of yellow and black over 
the nodding heads of clover. 



“Start again,” said the teacher 
and grass, clover and butterflies 
all vanished. 

Now a sidewalk appeared, tar 
and gum smeared, streaked with 
cracks over the cement coating. 
Feet passed over it again and 
again, pairs of feet, dozens of feet, 
hundreds of feet. Soon they were 
as densely packed as sheaves of 
corn in a silo. A whistle blew, the 
feet shuffled and then went up in a 
puff of smoke. 

“Fair,” said the teacher. “Con- 
siderable improvement over the 
first try, but you’ve far to go.” 

The class was over. The stu- 
dents dispersed, each one secret- 
ly elated over the skills he had 
shown that day. The teacher 
sighed over the dearth of real tal- 
ent among the neophytes. He sat 
back and ruminated over the kinds 
of classes he’d had in years past. 

“Tho.se kids had the stuff,” he 
said to himself and he flushed at 
the realization that he had spok- 
en aloud. 

L ater that night he discussed 
his feelings with Marie. She 
shook her head in disagreement. 

“They haven’t changed. It’s 
you,” she said. “I think you’re jeal- 
ous of them because they will be 
the doers and you will stay a 
teacher.” 

“Nonsense,” he said acerbical- 
ly. “I could be a doer. I just don’t 
choose to. I’ve been through a 
more rigorous training course 



than any of them. I’ve dreamed up 
teeming cities, motley popula- 
tions, sagas of heroes and cow- 
ards, ravaging plagues and Gold- 
en ages. I’ve drawn poets and 
philosophers, hooligans and bul- 
lies.” 

She smiled. 

“I know you have,” she said. 
“You’ve even shown me bits and 
pieces of it. But there’s a gap be- 
tween theory and practice. And 
you’re missing an important in- 
gredient.” 

“I suppose it’s my disbelief in 
the supernatural,” he said. “Even 
you call me an atheist.” 

She sighed. 

“No," she said. “It’s compas- 
sion.” 

The night grew cold and she be- 
gan to shiver. He took her hand 
and stroked it until the blue tint 
became suffused with a darken- 
ing red. He put his mouth to her 
neck and, with his mind still on the 
unrealized greatness inside him, 
he whispered into the sweet 
scented skin. She enfolded him in 
her arms and drew him down be- 
side her. 

E AWOKE refreshed but still 
very much on edge. He hadn’t 
corrected any of the students’ 
homework nor had he prepared 
his lesson plan for the day. He 
went inside and showered, letting 
the soapy warm water caress his 
sleep-drenched skin, and he shook 
his head and growled. Later, after

he had eaten, he read the contents 
of each folder, penciling in his 
comments, sometimes terse, oc- 
casionally scathing. In rare in- 
stances he was almost compli- 
mentary. 

Marie is wrong. I'm not jealous 
of the students. / have more imag- 
ination and talent than the whole 
lot of them. 

He had put aside one of the fold- 
ers after a cursory look and lat- 
er, when he reopened and read it, 
he knew why. It was superb. The 
language was inspired, simple 
yet poetic, with an epic sweep. The 
characters were dynamic, violent 
and gentle by turns, moral and 
amoral, lovely and hideous. They 
were tormented and inspired. He 
was caught up in all of it and saw 
each scene unfold before his eyes. 
And he hated the student who had 
written this brilliant scenario. 

If only it were mine — What a job 
I could do with this. 

He would modify it here and 
there, he decided. Perhaps he 
ought to add the necessary little 
touches that would turn it into a vi- 
able scheme. And of everyone he 
knew, he alone had the maturity 
and discipline, the courage and 
craftsmanship to see it through. 

“I can be a doer,” he said aloud 
and the words were like a heady 
wine. 

H e held on to the folder. He 
told the student that his grade 
was an A-minus but that he had 



misplaced the manuscript. Se- 
cretly he studied it, fleshed it out, 
gave it his own subtle flavor until 
be was certain it was ready. Then 
he typed it up himself, placed his 
own name on the title page and 
sent it in to the Council of Critics. 

One week later he was sum- 
moned to their chambers. They 
were overwhelmed by this extra- 
ordinary work, they said, and he 
would be given permission to put 
it on. 

His heart was racing out of con- 
trol. 

“When will that be?” he said. He 
could barely talk. 

“Tomorrow, if you like. It will 
be a private showing for the 
Council alone.” 

He was assigned his stage and 
asked to begin. But was he ready? 
He became terrified at bringing 
this awesome script to life and was 
assailed by self doubts. Was he 
really up to it? And what if the stu- 
dent should discover the plagia- 
rism and expose him? There was 
total silence in the auditorium and 
a hushed expectation that wound 
about his body like a shroud. With 
trembling fingers, he turned the 
title page of the scenario and si- 
lently reread his opening lines: 

“In the beginning God created 
the heaven and the earth. And 
the earth was without form,

Ensign Beadle, his firsl lieuten- 
ant, was sympathetic. He said, 
“But it isn’t what you do. Captain. 
It isn’t what you know, even. It’s 
whom you know.’’ 

“You could be right. Number 
One,’’ admitted Grimes. “But in 
my case I’m afraid that it boils 
down to who knows me. Did you 
ever see that book. How To Win 
Friends And Influence Peopled I 
often think that I must have read 
the wrong half, the second half 
Beadle made a noncommittal 



noise. Then: “We're ready to lift 
ship. Captain. Mechanically, 
that is. Mr. Hollister, the new 
Psionic Radio Officer, has yet to 
join -and, of course, there are the 
passengers.’’ 

“Ah, yes. Let us not forget the 
passengers.’’ Grimes allowed 
himself a sardonic smile. “1 won- 
der what the Commodore has 
against iheml 

Beadle took the question literal- 
ly. “We’re the only Courier in port. 
Captain, and it’s essential that 



67 




our good Commissioner reaches 
Dhartana as soon as possible” 

“ — if not before,” finished 
Grimes. “All right. Number One. 
Is the V.I.P. suite swept and gar- 
nished?” 

“1 — I’ve been busy with the 
important preparations for Space, 
Captain.” 

Grimes scowled. “I sincerely 
hope, Number One, that Mrs. 
Commissioner Dalwood never 
hears you implying that she’s un- 
important. We’ll make a tour of 
the accommodation now." 

Followed by Beadle, he strode up 
the ramp into the airlock of his lit- 
tle ship, his “flying darning 
needle.” The V.I.P. suite took up 
almost the entire compartment 
below the officers’ flat. As he 
passed through the sliding door 
into the sitting room Grimes’ 
prominent ears reddened; with 
him it was a sign of anger as well as 
of embarrassment. “Damn it all. 
Number One,” he explained, 
“don’t you realize that this woman 
is one of the civilian big wheels on 
the Board of Admiralty? You may 
not want promotion — but 1 do. 
Look at that table top! Drinking 
glass rings - and it must have been 
something sweet and sticky-- and 
bloody nearly an inch of cigarette 
ash. And the ashtrays! They 
haven’t been emptied since God 
was a pup.” 

“The suite hasn’t been used since 
we carried Mr. Alberto.” 

“I know that. Am I to suppose 



that you’ve kept it the way he left it 
in loving memory of him?” 

“You did say, sir, that bearing in 
mind the circumstances of his 
death we should leave everything 
untouched in case his depart- 
ment wanted to make a thorough 
investigation.” 

“And his department did check 
just to make sure that he’d left 
nothing of interest on board when 
he disembarked on Doncaster. 
But that was months ago. And this 
bedroom — the way it is now I 
wouldn’t put a dog into it. Get on 
the blower at once to Main- 
tenance. Ask them — no, tell 
them- to send a cleaning detail 
here immediately.” 

Grimes became uncomfortably 
aware that someone breathed 
behind him. He turned slowly, re- 
luctantly, looked into the hard, 
steel-gray eyes of the woman who 
was standing just inside the door- 
way. 

She was tall and handsome, with 
short-cut platinum blond hair, a 
beautifully tailored gray cos- 
tume that looked like a uniform 
but wasn’t that looked more like 
a uniform than the deliberately 
casual rig of the day affected by 
Grimes and Beadle in common 
with all Courier Service officers. 
Her figure seemed to be that of a 
girl but her face, although un- 
lined, was old. It showed no physi- 
cal marks of age, but it was some- 
how obvious that she had seen too 
much, experienced too much.

GALAXY 




(Jrimes thought, If she smiles, 
something will crack. 

She didn’t smile. 

She said — and her voice, 
although well modulated, was 
hard as the rest of her — “Mr. 
(irimes.” 

“Ma’am?” 

“I am Commissioner Dalwood.” 
She did not extend her hand, 
(irimes bowed stiffly. “Honored 
to have you aboard. Ma’am.” 

“The honor is all yours, Mr. 
(irimes. Tell me, is the rest of your 
ship like this pigsty?” 

“We’re having the suite put to 
rights, Mrs. Dalwood.” 

“Pray do not put yourself out on 
my behalf, Mr. Grimes. My lady’s 
maid and my two robot servants 
are at this moment bringing my 
baggage aboard. The robots are 
versatile. If you will let them have 
the necessary cleaning gear they 
will soon have these quarters fit 
for human occupancy.” 

“Mr. Beadle,” ordered Grimes, 
"Belay that call to Maintenance. 
See that Mrs. Dalwood’s servants 
are issued what they need.” 

“Very good, sir,” replied Beadle 
smartly, glad of the chance to 
make his escape. 

“And now, Mr. Grimes, if I may 
sit down somewhere in less squalid 
surroundings 

“Certainly, Ma’am. If you will 
follow me — ” 

G rimes led the way out of the 
suite. The two humanoid ro- 



bots, with expensive-looking bag- 
gage piled at their feet, stared at 
him impassively. The maid - small, 
plump, pert and darkly brunette — 
allowed a flicker of sympathy to 
pass over her rosy face. Grimes 
thought that she winked, but he 
couldn’t be sure. On the way up 
to his own quarters he was relieved 
to see that Beadle had kept the rest 
of the ship in a reasonably good 
state of cleanliness, although he 
did hear one or two disapproving 
sniffs from his passenger. His own 
day cabin was, he knew, untidy. 
He liked it that way. 

He was not surprised when Mrs. 
Dalwood said, “Your desk, Mr. 
Grimes. Surely some of those pa- 
pers are of such a confidential na- 
ture that they should be in your 
safe.” 

Grimes said, “Nobody comes in 
here except by invitation. 1 trust 
my officers. Ma’am.” 

The Commissioner smiled 
thinly. Nothing cracked. She said, 
“What a child you are. Lieu- 
tenant. One of the first lessons 1 
learned in politics was never to 
trust anybody.” 

“In Space, aboard ship, you 
have to trust people. Ma’am.” 

She sat down in Grimes’ easy 
chair, extending her long, elegant 
legs. Grimes suspected that she 
looked at her own limbs with brief 
admiration before returning her 
regard to him. Her laugh was 
brittle. 

“How touching. Lieutenant. 



WHAT YOU KNOW 



69 




And that is why ships are lost now 
and again.” 

“May 1 offer you refreshment. 
Ma’am?” Grimes said, changing 
the subject. 

“And do you drink. Lieuten- 
ant?” 

I know damn well that I'm only 
a two ringer. Grimes thought, but 
/ do like being called Captain 
aboard my own ship . 

He said, “Never on departure 
day, Mrs. Dalwood.” 

“Perhaps I shall be wise if 1 
conform to the same rule. 1 must 
confess that I am not used to 
traveling in vessels of this class 
and it is possible that 1 shall need 
all my wits about me during lift- 
off. Might I ask for a cup of cof- 
fee?” 

Grimes took from its rack the 
thermos container, which he had 
refilled from the galley coffee- 
maker that morning. After he 
had removed the cap he realized 
that he had still to produce cup, 
sugar bowl, spoon and milk. His 
telltale ears proclaiming his em- 
barrassment he replaced the con- 
tainer, conscious of the woman’s 
coldly amused scrutiny. At last he 
had things ready, finally filling the 
jug from a carton of milk in his re- 
frigerator. 

She said, “The milk should be 
warmed.” 

“Yes, Mrs. Dalwood. Of course. 
If you wouldn’t mind waiting just 
one moment” 

“If 1 took my coffee white I 



should mind. But 1 prefer it black 
and unsweetened.” 

Grimes poured, remembering 
that the coffee-maker was long 
overdue for a thorough cleaning. 
Adder’s coffee had a tang of its 
own. Her people were accus- 
tomed to it. The Commissioner 
was not. After one cautious sip she 
put her cup down, hard. 

She asked, “And what is the 
food like aboard this ship?” 

“Usually quite good. Ma’am. 
We carry no ratings or petty of- 
ficers, so we take turns cooking. 
Mr. Beadle - he’s my First Lieu- 
tenant-makes an excellent 
stew.” Grimes babbled on. “It’s a 
sort of a curry, actually, but not 
quite, if you know what I mean.” 

“I don’t. Lieutenant. Nor do I 
wish to. As I have already told you, 
my robots are versatile. Might I 
suggest that they take over galley 
duties, first of all thoroughly clean- 
ing all vessels and implements, 
starting with your coffee-maker? 
Apart from anything else it will 
mean that your officers will have 
more time to devote to their real 
duties.” 

“If you want it that way, Mrs. 
Dalwood” 

“I do want it that way.” 

To Grimes’ intense relief the 
intercom phone buzzed. He said to 
the Commissioner, “Excuse me. 
Ma’am,” and then into the speak- 
er/microphone, “Captain here.” 
“First Lieutenant, Captain. Mr. 
Hollister, the new P.C.O., has just 



70 



GALAXY 




boarded. Shall I send him up to re- 
port to you?” 

“Yes, Mr. Beadle. Tell him that 
I’ll see him in the Control Room. 
Now.” He turned to Mrs. Dal- 
wood. “I’m afraid I must leave you 
for a few minutes, Ma’am. There 
are cigarettes in that box, and if 
you wish more coffee — ” 

“I most certainly do not. And, 
Mr. Grimes, don’t you think that 
you had better put those papers 
away in your safe before you go 
about your pressing business?” 
She allowed herself another thin 
smile. “After all, you haven’t asked 
yet to see my identification. For 
all you know I could be a spy.” 

And if you are, thought Grimes, 
/ hope I'm the officer command- 
ing the firing squad. 

He said, “You are very well 
known. Ma’am.” 

He swept his desk clean, deposit- 
ing the pile of official and private 
correspondence on the deck, then 
fumbled through the routine of 
opening his safe. As usual the door 
stuck. Finally he had the papers 
locked away. He bowed again to 
Mrs. Dalwood, who replied with 
a curt nod. He climbed the ladders 
to Control, glad to get to a part of 
the ship where. Commissioner or 
no Commissioner, he was king. 

Beadle was awaiting him there 
with a tall, thin, pale young man 
who looked like a scarecrow 
rigged out in a cast-off Survey 
Service uniform. He announced, 
before Beadle could perform the 



introductions, “I don’t like this 
ship. I am very sensitive to at- 
mosphere. This is an unhappy 
ship.” 

“She didn’t use to be,” Grimes 
told him glumly. 

U sually Grimes enjoyed ship- 
handling. Invariably he would 
invite his passengers to the con- 
trol room during lift-off, and most 
times this invitation would be ac- 
cepted. He had extended the cour- 
tesy to Mrs. Dalwood, hoping 
that she would refuse the offer. 
But she did not. She sat in the spare 
acceleration seat, saying nothing 
but noticing everything. It would 
almost have been better had she 
kept a continual flow of Why-do- 
you-do-this? and Why-don t-you- 
do-that? 

Her very presence made Grimes 
nervous. The irregular beat of the 
inertial drive sounded wrong to 
him as Adder climbed slowly up 
and away from her pad. And, as 
soon as she was off the ground, the 
ship yawed badly, falling to an 
angle of seven degrees from the 
vertical. It must look bad. Grimes 
knew. It looked bad and it felt 
worse. The only thing to do about 
it was to get upstairs in a hurry 
before some sarcastic comment 
from Port Control came through 
the transceiver. Grimes picked his 
moment for turning on the 
auxiliary rockets, waiting until the 
tall, slender tower that was Adder 
was canted away from the wind. 



WHAT YOU KNOW 



71 




That way, he hoped, he could make 
it all look intentional, convey the 
impression that he was using the 
quite stiff north-wester to give him 
additional speed. 

He managed to turn in his seat in 
spite of the uncomfortable ac- 
celeration and force out the words; 

“Letting — the — wind — help 
— us — ” 

She — calm, unruffled — lifted her 
slender eyebrows and asked, with 
apparently genuine unconcern, 
“Really?” 

“Time — ” Grimes persisted, 
“is — money.” 

“So,” she told him, “is reaction 
mass.” 

Flushing, Grimes returned to 
his controls. Apart from that 
annoying yaw the ship was hand- 
ling well enough. Beadle, and Von 
Tannenbaum, the navigator, and 
Slovotny, electronic communi- 
cations, were quietly efficient at 
their stations. They were cer- 
tainly quiet. There was none of the 
usual good-humored banter. 

Sulkily Grimes pushed Adder 
up through the last, high wisps of 
cirrus, into the purple twilight, to- 
wards the bright, unwinking 
stars. She screamed through the 
final tenuous shreds of atmos- 
phere and quite soon thereafter 
Von Tannenbaum reported that 
she was clear of the Van Allens. 
Grimes, still far too conscious of 
the Commissioner’s cold regard, 
cut inertial and reaction drives, 
then slowly and carefully — far 



more slowly than was usual — used 
his directional gyroscopes to 
swing the sharp prow of the ship on 
to the target star. He applied cor- 
rection for Galactic Drift — and 
then realized that he had put it on 
the wrong way. He mumbled some- 
thing that sounded unconvincing 
even to himself about overcom- 
pensation and, after a few seconds 
that felt more like minutes, had the 
vessel headed in the right direc- 
rection. 

He wondered what would 
happen when he started the Mann- 
schenn Drive — but nothing did; 
nothing, that is, worse than the fa- 
miliar but always disquieting 
sense of deja vu. He had a vision of 
himself as an old, old lieutenant 
with a long white beard - but this 
had nothing to do with the tem- 
poral precession field of the 
Drive, was induced rather by the 
psionic field generated by the Com- 
missioner. He didn’t like her and 
had a shrewd suspicion that she 
didn’t like him. 

She said, “Very educational, 
Mr. Grimes. Very educational.” 

She unstrapped herself from her 
chair. Slovotny and Von Tannen- 
baum got up from their own seats, 
each determined courteously to 
assist her from hers. They col- 
lided. Von Tannenbaum tripped 
and fell and Beadle fell over him. 

“Very educational,” repeated 
the Commissioner, gracefully ex- 
tricating herself from her chair, 
unaided. “Oh, Mr. Grimes, could 



72 



GALAXY 




you come to see me in ten minutes’ 
time? We have to discuss the new 
galley routine.” 

“Certainly, Mrs. Dalwood.” 
Grimes turned to his embarrassed 
officers. “Deep Space Routine, 
Mr. Beadle.” Usually he said, 
“Normal Deep Space Routine,” 
but he had a suspicion that things 
would not be at all normal. 

II 

HINGS were not normal. 
Usually Adder’s people were 
gourmands rather than gourmets 
and a certain tightness of waist- 
bands was an accepted fact of life. 
Even when whoever was doing the 
cooking produced an inedible 
mess bellies could be filled, and 
were filled, with sandwiches of 
the doorstep variety. But these 
relatively happy days were over. 

As she had told Grimes, the 
Commissioner’s robots were 
skilled cooks. To have called them 
chefs would not have been exag- 
gerating. Insofar as subtlety of 
flavorings and attractiveness of 
presentation were concerned, no- 
body could fault them. To the 
average spaceman, however, 
quantity is as important as 
quality. There were no second 
helpings. The coldly efficient 
automatons must have calculated 
just how much nutriment each and 
every person aboard required to 
operate efficiently himself — and 
that was all that he ever got. Too, 
at least one of the mechanical ser- 



vitors was always doing something 
or other around the galley and 
storerooms and Grimes and his 
officers knew that the partaking 
of snacks between meals would be 
reported at once to Mrs. Dalwood. 

A real Captain, one with four 
gold bands on his shoulderboards 
and scrambled egg on the peak of 
his cap, would never have toler- 
ated the situation. But Grimes, for 
all his authority and responsi- 
bility, was too junior an officer. 
He was only a Lieutenant, and a 
passed-over one at that, while the 
Commissioner, although a ci- 
vilian, could tell Admirals to jump 
through the hoop. 

But he was hungry. 

One morning, ship’s time, he 
went down to the solarium for his 
daily exercises. This compart- 
ment could more aptly have been 
called the gymnasium, but since it 
was part of the “farm” it got its 
share of the ultraviolet required 
for the hydroponics tanks. Mrs. 
Dalwood and her maid, Rosa- 
leen, were still there, having their 
daily workout, when Grimes went 
in. Always he had managed to ar- 
rive after the two women had 
finished, but for some reason he 
was running ahead of schedule. It 
was not that he was prudish and 
neither were they, but he had de- 
cided that the less he had to do with 
them the better. 

As he entered the room he no- 
ticed their gowns hanging outside 
the sauna. He shrugged. So what? 



WHAT YOU KNOW 



73 




This was his ship. He took off his 
own robe and then, clad only in 
trunks, mounted the stationary bi- 
cycle. He began to pedal away al- 
most happily, watching the clock 
as he did so. 

From the corner of his eye he 
saw the. door of the sauna open. 
The Commissioner, followed by 
her maid, came out. It was the first 
time he had seen Mrs. Dalwood 
nude. Prompted to whistle, he 
thought better of it. She was a bit 
of all right, he admitted, if you 
liked ’em lean and hungry. He in- 
clined his head towards her cour- 
teously, carried on pedaling. 

Rather to his surprise she stood 
there, looking him over. 

She said, “Mr. Grimes, there is a 
little improvement in your con- 
dition, but that probably is due to 
a properly balanced diet.” She 
walked toward him, her feet slim 
and elegant on the carpeted deck, 
her breast jouncing ever so slight- 
ly. “Get off that thing, will you?” 

Grimes did so, on the side away 
from her. She stooped with fluid 
grace and tested the pedals with 
her right hand. 

“Mr. Grimes, how in Space do 
you hope to get any benefit from 
these exercises unless you do 
them properly?” Her hand went to 
the adjusting screw of the roller 
on top of the wheel, turned it 
clockwise. The muscles of her right 
arm stood out clearly under the 
smooth brown skin as she tested 
the pedals again. Then she actual- 



ly smiled, saying, “On your bi- 
cycle, spaceman.” 

Grimes remounted. He had to 
push hard to start the wheel ro- 
tating. He had to push hard to keep 
it rotating. Now and again he had 
ridden on real bicycles, but al- 
most always had dismounted 
rather than pedal up a steep hill. 
She stood watching him. Until 
now he would have thought it im- 
possible actively to dislike an at- 
tractive naked woman. But there 
had to be a first time for anything. 

The Commissioner turned to her 
maid. “Rosaleen, you were last on 
the bicycle. Did you readjust it?” 

The girl blushed guiltily over her 
entire body. “Yes, Ma’am.” 

“I see I shall have to check on 
you too.” The woman glanced at 
the watch that was her only article 
of clothing. “Unluckily 1 have 
some work to do. However, you 
may stay here for another thirty 
minutes. The bicycle again, the 
rowing machine, the horizontal 
bars. And you, Mr. Grimes, will 
see to it that she does something 
about shedding that disgusting 
fat.” 

Grimes did not say what he was 
thinking. He had little breath to 
say anything. He managed to 
gasp, “Yes, Ma’am.” 

Mrs. Dalwood went to her gown, 
shrugged it on, thrust her feet into 
sandals. She walked gracefully to 
the door. She did not look back at 
the man on the bicycle, the girl on 
the rowing machine. 



74 



GALAXY 




As soon as the door had shut 
behind her Rosaleen stopped row- 
ing-. 

She said, “Phew'!” 

Grimes went on pedaling. 

“Hey, Captain. Take five. 
Avast, or whatever you say.” 
Grimes stopped. 

He said, “You’d better carry on 
with your rowing.” 

The girl grinned. “We’re quite 
safe. Captain. She is so used to 
having every order implicitly 
obeyed that she’d never dream of 
coming back to investigate us.” 
“You know her better than I 
do,” admitted Grimes. 

“I should.” She got up from the 
sliding seat of the rowing ma- 
chine, Hopped down to the deck. 
She was. Grimes decided, at least 
as attractive as her mistress and 
she had the advantage of youth. 
And there was so much more of 
her. The spaceman looked her 
over, studying her almost clinical- 
ly. Yes, she had been losing 
weight. Her skin was not as taut as 
it should have been. 

She noticed his look. She 
complained, “Yes, I’m starved.” 
“You get the same as we do, 
Rosaleen.” 

“That’s the trouble. Captain.” 
“But you have this sort of feed- 
ing all the time.” 

“Like hell I do. I have my nights 
off, you know, and then I catch up 
on the pastries and candy and the 
hot rolls with lots of butter, and 
the roast pork, with crackling — ” 



“Please stop,” begged Grimes. 
“You’re making me ravenous.” 

She went on, “But aboard your 
ship I have to toe the line. There’s 
no escape.” 

“I suppose not.” 

“But surely you can do 
something. You’ve storerooms, 
with bread-” 

“Yes, but-” 

“You aren’t scared of her. 
Captain?” She looked at him 
through big, dark eyes. He had 
thought they were black now he 
saw that they were a very deep vio- 
let. 

“Mphm.” He allowed his glance 
to stray downwards, then hastily 
looked back at her face. Invitation 
had been in every line of her ample 
body. He was no snob and the fact 
that her status was that of a ser- 
vant weighed little with him. But 
she was the Commissioner’s ser- 
vant. A lady has no secrets from 
her lady’s maid — was the converse 
true? Anyhow, both were women 
and no doubt happily prattled to 
each other, disparity of social 
status notwithstanding. 

She said plaintively, “I’m 
hungry. Captain.” 

“So am I, Rosaleen.” 

“But you’re the Captain.” 

Grimes got off the bicycle. He 
said, “It's time for my sauna.” 

He threw his shorts in the 
general direction of the hook on 
which his robe was hanging, strode 
to the door of the hot room, opened 
it. She followed him. He stretched

out on one of the benches, she 
flopped on one opposite him. 

She said, “I’m hungry.” 

“It’s those damned robots,” 
complained Grimes. “Always 
hanging around the galley and 
storerooms.” 

“They won’t be there tonight.” 
“How do you know?” 

“They’re much more than cooks. 
Even I don’t know all the things 
they’ve been programed for. This I 
do know. She has been working on 
a report, and tomorrow it will be 
encoded for transmission. The 
way that she does it is to give it to 
John -he’s the one with the little 
gold knob on top of his head - to 
encode. And James decodes each 
sheet as John finishes it, to ensure 
that there are no errors.” 

“Are there ever any?” 

“No. But she likes to be sure.” 
“She would.” He wondered 
when he was going to start sweat- 
ing. The girl was already per- 
spiring profusely. “Tell me, when 
does this encoding/decoding ses- 
sion take place?” 

“After dinner.” 

“And there’s no chance of her 
breaking it off?” 

“None at all.” 

“Mphm.” The sweat was start- 
ing to stream out of Grimes’ pores 
now. The girl got up, began to 
flick the skin of his back lightly 
with the birch twigs. He ap- 
preciated the attention. “Mphm. 
And are you free while all this Top 
Secret stuff is going on?” 



“Yes.” 

“And she should have her nose 
stuck into it by twenty hours?” 
“Yes, Captain.” 

“Then meet me outside the 
galley at, say, fifteen past twenty.” 
“Yes!” 

“Thick buttered toast,” mur- 
mured Grimes, deciding that talk- 
ing about food took his mind off 
other things. 

“Lots of butter,” she added. 
“And sardines.” 

“Fat, oily sardines.” 

“With lemon wedges.” 

“With mayonnaise.” she cor- 
rected. 

“All right. Mayonnaise.” 

“And coffee. With sugar and 
great dollops of cream.” 

“I’ll have beer, myself, even 
though it is fattening.” 

“We can have beer with- and 
coffee after.” 

The door slid open and Hollister 
came in. Naked, the telepath 
looked more like a living skeleton 
than ever. Grimes regarded him 
with some distaste and wondered 
if the psionic radio officer had 
been eavesdropping. To do so 
would be contrary to the very 
strict code of the Rhine In- 
stitute — but espers, in spite of their 
occasional claims to superiority, 
were only human. 

He said, “I’m just about cooked, 
Rosaleen.” 

“So am I, Captain.” She got up 
from her bench, the perspiration 
pouring down her still plump

body, went through into the show- 
er room. Through the closed door 
Grimes heard the hiss of the water, 
her little scream as its coldness 
hit her. There was the whine of the 
blowers as she dried off and then 
she ran through the hot room on 
her way back into the solarium. 

“Quite a dish. Captain,” 
commented Hollister. 

“We,” Grimes told him coldly, 
“are neither kings nor peasants.” 
He took his own cold shower and 
when he stepped out into the gym- 
nasium Rosaleen was gone. 

D inner that night was as un- 
satisfying as usual. A clear soup, 
a small portion of delicious baked 
fish with a green salad, a raw ap- 
ple for desert. Grimes, at the head 
of the table, tried to make conver- 
sation, but the Commissioner 
was in a thoughtful mood and 
hardly spoke at all. Beadle, Slo- 
votny, Vitelli and Hollister 
wolfed their portions as though 
eating were about to be made il- 
legal, saying little. The four of- 
ficers excused themselves as soon 
as they decently could — Slovotny 
going up to Control to relieve Von 
Tannenbaum for his dinner. 
Beadle to have a look at the air cir- 
culatory system, Vitelli to check 
up on the Mannschenn Drive. 
Hollister didn’t bother to invent 
an excuse. He just left. Von Tan- 
nenbaum came down, took his 
place at the table. He was starting 
to acquire a lean and hungry look 



that went well with his Nordic 
fairness. The Commissioner 
nodded to him, then patted her lips 
gently with her napkin. Grimes, 
interpreting the signs correctly, 
got up to help her from her chair. 
She managed to ignore the ges- 
ture. 

She said, “You must excuse me, 
Mr. Grimes and Mr. von Tannen- 
baum. 1 am rather busy this even- 
ing.” 

“May I, or my officers, be of 
any assistance?” asked Grimes po- 
litely. 

She took her time replying, and 
he was afraid that she would take 
his offer. Then she said, “Thank 
you, Mr. Grimes. But is is very 
confidential work and I don’t 
think that you have Security clear- 
ance.” 

The refusal may have been 
intended as a snub but Grimes wel- 
comed it. 

“Good night. Ma’am.” 

“Good night, Mr. Grimes.” 

Von Tannenbaum turned to the 
serving robot which was waiting 
until he had finished his meal. 
“Any chance of another portion of 
fish, James?” 

“No, sir,” the thing replied in a 
metallic voice. “Her Excellency 
has instructed me that there are to 
be no second helpings for any- 
body.” 

“Oh.” 

In sulky silence the navigator 
finished his meal. Grimes was 
tempted to include him in the sup-

per party, but decided against it. 
The fewer people who knew about 
it the better. 

The two men rose from the table, 
each going to his own quarters. In 
his day cabin Grimes mixed him- 
self a drink, feeling absurdly 
guilty as he did so. 

Damn it all, this is my ship. I’m 
Captain of her, not that cast iron 
bitch! 

Defiantly — but why should he 
feel defiant?— he finished what was 
in his glass, then poured another 
generous portion. But he made it 
fast, looking frequently at his 
clock as he sipped. 

2014 . 

Near enough. 

He walked out to the axial shaft, 
tried not to make too much noise 
going down the ladder. He paused 
briefly in the officers’ flat, on the 
deck below and abaft his own. 
Faint music emanated from be- 
hind the door of Von Tan- 
nenbaum’s cabin Wagner? It 
sounded like it - and loud snores 
from inside Beadle’s room. His 
own air circulatory system could 
do with overhauling, thought 
Grimes. Slovotny was on watch 
and Hollister, no doubt, was 
wordlessly communicating with 
his psionic amplifier, the poodle’s 
brain in aspic. 

Vitelli could be anywhere, but 
was probably in the engineroom. 

The V.I.P. suite was on the next 
deck down. As he passed the door 
Grimes could hear the Commis- 



sioner dictating something, one of 
the robots repeating her words. 
That took eare of her. Another 
deck, with cabins for not very im- 
portant people. He thought of 
tapping on Rasaleen’s door, then 
decided against it. In any case, she 
was waiting for him outside the 
galley. 

She whispered, “I was afraid 
you’d change your mind. Cap- 
tain.” 

“Not bloody likely.” 

H e led the way into the spot- 
less-thanks to the industry of 
the robot servitors- galley. He 
was feeling oddly excited. He was 
reminded of his training cruise, 
when he had been a very new (and 
always hungry) cadet. But then 
there had been locks to pick. 

He opened the door of the tinned 
food storeroom, ran his eye over 
the shelves. He heard Rosaleen 
gasp. 

“New Erin ham — Carinthian 
sausage — ” 

“You’ll have Atlantan sardines, 
my girl, and like ’em- ah, here we 
are. A can each?” 

“Two cans.” 

“All right. Here you are. You 
can switch on the toaster while I 
rummage in the bread locker.” 

He thrust the cans into her eager 
hands, then collected bread, but- 
ter and seasonings. He tore open 
the wrapper of a loaf, put the thick 
slices on the rack under the gril- 
ler. The smell of the cooking toast 



78 



GALAXY 




was mouthwatering — too mouth- 
watering. He hoped that it would 
not be distributed throughout the 
ship by the ventilation system. 
But the Commissioner’s overly 
efficient robots must, by this 
time, have put the air out-take 
filters to rights. 

One side done. He turned the 
slices over. 

Rosaleen asked plaintively, 
“How do you work this opener?” 

A metallic voice replied, “Like 
th is. Miss Rosaleen — but I forbid 
you to use it.” 

“Take your claws off me, you 
tin bastard!” 

Grimes turned fast. Behind him 
the toast smoldered unheeded. 
His hands went out to clamp on the 
wrists of the robot, whose own 
hands gripped the girl’s arms. The 
automaton ignored him. If it 
could have sneered it would have 
done so. 

“Mr. Grimes. Rosaleen.” The 
Commissioner’s voice was hard as 
metal. In her all-grey costume she 
looked like a robot herself. “Mr. 
Grimes, please do not attempt to 
interfere with my servitor.” She 
looked coldly at the little group. 
“All right, John, you may release 
Miss Rosaleen. But not until Mr. 
Grimes has taken his hands off 
you. And now, Mr. Grimes, what is 
the meaning of this? I seem to have 
interrupted a disgusting orgy. Oh, 
Joh, you might extinguish that 
minor conflagration and dispose 
of the charred remains.” 



“Supper,” said Grimes at last. 

“Supper?” 

“Yes, Ma’am. Rosaleen and I 
were about to enjoy a light 
snack.” 

' “A light snack? Don’t you 
realize the trouble that went into 
working out suitable menus for 
this ship?” She paused, looking at 
Grimes with an expression of ex- 
treme distaste. “Legally since 
your superiors, in a moment of 
aberration, saw fit to appoint you 
to command, you may do as you 
like aboard this vessel — within 
limits. The seduction of my maid 
is beyond those limits.” 

“Seduction?” This was too 
much. “I assure you that — ” 

“I was not using the word in its 
sexual sense. Come, Rosaleen, we 
will leave Mr. Grimes to his feast. 
He has to keep his strength up — al- 
though for what 1 cannot say.” 

“Ma’am!” The girl’s face was no 
longer soft, her voice held a com- 
pelling ring. “Since you use that 
word — it was I who seduced the 
Captain.” 

“That hardly improves matters, 
Rosaleen. The commanding 
officer of a warship, even a very 
minor one, should not allow him- 
self to be influenced by a woman 
passenger.” 

“You said it,” snapped Grimes. 
This could mean the ruin of his 
career but he had been pushed too 
far. “You said it, Mrs. Dalwood. I 
should never have let myself be 
influenced by you. I should never 



WHAT YOU KNOW 



79 




have allowed your tin dieticians to 
run loose in my galley. I should 
have insisted, from the very start, 
on running my ship my way. 
Furthermore — ” He was warm- 
ing up nicely. “Furthermore, 1 
doubt if even your fellow Com- 
missioners will approve of your 
ordering an officer to spy on his 
Captain.” 

“1 don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about, Mr. Grimes.” 

“Don’t you, Mrs. Dalwood? 
Who put you wise to this little 
party in the galley? Who would 
have known about it? Who but 
Hollister? I shouldn’t like to be in 
your shoes when the Rhine Insti- 
tute gets my report on my psionic 
radio officer. They’re no respecters 
of admirals - or commissioners.” 

“Have you quite finished, Mr. 
Grimes?” With the mounting flush 
on her cheeks the Commissioner 
was beginning to look human. 

“For the time being.” 

“Then let me tell you, 
Lieutenant, that whatever secrets 
Lieutenant Hollister may have 
learned about you are still safely 
locked within his mind. If you had 
been reading up on the latest 
advances in robotics- which, 
obviously, you have not — you 
would have learned that psionic 
robots, electronic telepaths, are 
already in production. This has 
not been advertised — but neither 
is it a secret. Such automata can be 
recognized by the little gold knob 
on top of their skulls.” 



The robot John inclined its head 
toward Grimes and the golden 
embellishment seemed to wink at 
him sardonically. 

“You tin fink,” snarled the 
spaceman. 

“I am not a fink, sir. A fink is 
one who betrays his friend — and 
you were never a friend to me and 
my kind. Was it not in this very 
vessel, under your command, that 
Mr. Adam met his end?” 

“That will do, John,” snapped 
the Commissioner. 

“I still resent being spied upon.” 
“That will do. Lieutenant.” 

“Like hell it will. 1 give you no- 
tice that I have resigned from the 
Survey Service. I’ve had a bellyful 
of being treated like a child.” 

“But that is what you are.” 
“Captain,” Rosaleen was plead- 
ing. “Please stop it. You’re only 
making things worse. Mrs. Dal- 
wood, it was my fault. I swear that 
it was.” 

“Anything that happens aboard 
my ship is my fault,” insisted 
Grimes. 

“From your own mouth you 
condemn yourself, Lieutenant. 1 
am tempted, as a Commissioner, 
to accept your resignation here 
and now, but I feel” her features 
sagged, the outlines of her body 
became hazy, the gray of her cos- 
tume shimmered irridesccntly — 
“Leef I tub” She was her nor- 
mal self again. “But I feel — ” 
Again the uncanny change. “Lgef 
I tub — ” 



80 



GALAXY 




This is all / need . 

Grimes listened to the sudden, 
irregular warbling of the 
Mannschenn Drive, recognized 
the symptoms of breakdown, time 
running backward and deja vu. He 
had another vision — but this time 
he was not an elderly Survey Ser- 
vice Lieutenant; he was an even 
more elderly Rim Runners Third 
Mate. They would be the only out- 
fit in all the Galaxy that would 
dream of employing him — but 
even they would never promote 
him. 

The thin, high keening of the 
Drive faded to a barely audible 
hum, then died as the tumbling, 
ever-precessing gyroscopes slowed 
to a halt. From the bulkhead 
speakers came Slovotny’s voice 
calm enough, but with more than 
a hint of urgency. 

“Captain to Control, please. 
Captain to Control — ” 

“On my way,” Grimes barked 
into the nearest speaker/micro- 
phone. “Carry on with emergency 
procedure.” 

“All hands secure for Free Fall. 
All hands secure for Free Fall. The 
inertial drive will be shut down in 
precisely thirty seconds.” 

“What is happening, Mr. 
Grimes?” demanded the Commis- 
sioner. 

“It should be obvious, even to 
you.” 

“It is. Just what one could ex- 
pect from this ship.” 

“It’s not the ship’s fault. She’s 



had no proper maintenance for 
months.” 

He pushed past the women and 
the robot, dived into the axial 
shaft. The greater part of his jour- 
ney to Control was made in Free 
Fall conditions. He hoped 
maliciously that the Commis- 
sioner was being spacesick. 

N either the commissioner 
nor her robots had the gall to 
infest the control room. Grimes 
sat strapped into the command 
seat, surrounded by his officers. 

“Report, Mr. Vitelli,” he said to 
the engineer, who had just come up 
from the engineroom. 

“The Drive’s had it. Captain,” 
Vitelli told him. A greenish pallor 
showed through the engineer’s dark 
skin, accentuated by a smear of 
black grease. “Not only the 
governor bearings, but the rotor 
bearings.” 

“We have spares, of course.” 
“We should have spares, but we 
don’t. The ones we had were used 
by the shore gang during the last 
major overhaul, as far as I can 
gather from Mr. McCloud’s rec- 
ords. They should have been re- 
placed — but all that’s in the boxes 
is waste and shavings.” 

“Could we cannibalize?” asked 
Grimes. “From the inertial drive 
generators?” 

“We could — if we had a ma- 
chine shop to turn the bearings 
down to size. But that wouldn’t do 
us much good.” 



WHAT YOU KNOW 



81 




“Why not?” 

“The main rotor’s warped. Until 
it’s replaced the Drive’s unusable.” 

Beadle muttered something 
about not knowing if it was Christ- 
mas Day or last Thursday. Grimes 
ignored this — although, like all 
spacemen, he dreaded the 
temporal consequences of Mann- 
schenn Drive malfunction. 

“Sparks — is anybody within 
easy reach? I could ask for a tow.” 

“There’s Princess Helga, Cap- 
tain. Shall 1 give her a call?” 

“Not until 1 tell you. Mr. Hol- 
lister, have you anything to add to 
what Mr. Slovotny has told me?" 

“No, sir.” The telepath's deep- 
set eyes were smoldering with 
resentment, and for a moment 
Grimes wondered why. Then he 
realized that the man must have 
eavesdropped on his quarrel with 
the Commissioner, had “heard” 
Grimes’ assertion that he, Hol- 
lister, had carried tales to Mrs. 
Dalwood. 

I’m sorry. Grimes thought. But 
how was I to know that that 
blasted robot was a mind-reader? 

“I should have warned you, sir,” 
admitted Hollister. The others 
looked at Grimes and Hollister 
curiously. Grimes could almost 
hear them thinking. Should have 
warned him of what? 

“Princess Helga . .’’ mur- 
mured Grimes. 

“Light cruiser. Captain,’’ 
Slovotny told him. “Royal 
Skandian Navy.” 



“And is the Federation on 
speaking terms with Skandia?” 
wondered Grimes audibly. He an- 
swered his own question. “Only 
just. Well, there’s no future — or 
too bloody much future — in sitting 
here until somebody really 
friendly chances along. Get the 
Princess on the Carlotti, Sparks. 
Give her our coordinates. Ask her 
for assistance. Perhaps her 
engineers will be able to repair our 
Drive, otherwise they can tow us 
to the nearest port.” 

“Shouldn’t we report first to 
Base, Captain?” asked Slovotny. 

Yes, we should, thought Grimes. 
But I'm not going to. I’ll put out a 
call for assistance before Her 
Highness shoves her ear in. After 
that — she can have a natter to 
Base . 

He said, “Get the signal away to 
Princess Helga. Tell her complete 
Mannschenn Drive breakdown. 
Request assistance. You know.” 

“Ay, Captain.” Slovotny busied 
himself at his Carlotti transceiver. 
The pilot antenna, the elliptical 
Mobius strip rotating about its 
long axis quivered, started to turn, 
hunting over the bearing along 
which the Skandian cruiser, 
invisible to optical instruments, 
unreachable by ordinary radio — 
which, in any case, would have had 
far too great a time lag — must lie. 

“Locked on,” announced the 
radio officer at last. He pushed the 
button that actuated the calling 
signal. Then he spoke into the 



82 



GALAXY 




microphone. ""Adder to Princess 
Helga. Adder to Princess Helga. 
Can you read me? Come in, 
please.” 

T here was the slightest of de- 
lays, and then the swirl of colors 
in the small, glowing screen 
coalesced to form a picture. The 
young woman looking out at them 
could have been Princess Helga 
(whoever she was) herself. She 
was blue-eyed, and hefty, and her 
uniform cap did nothing to confine 
the tumbling masses of her yellow 
hair. 

""Princess Helga to Adder. I read 
you loud and clear. Pass your 
message.” 

“Complete interstellar drive 
breakdown,” said Slovotny. “Re- 
quest assistance- repairs if pos- 
sible, otherwise tow. Coordinates 
. .” He rattled off a string of fig- 
ures from the paper that Von Tan- 
nenbaum handed him. 

The girl was replaced by a man. 
He should have been wearing a 
horned helmet instead of a cap. 
His eyes were blue, his hair and 
beard were yellow. He grinned 
wolfishly. 

He demanded, “Your Captain, 
please.” 

Grimes released himself from his 
chair, pulled himself into the one 
vacated by Slovotny. 

“Lieutenant Grimes here. 
Officer Commanding Courier Ship 
Adder." 



“Captain Olaf Andersen here. 
Lieutenant. What can I do for 
you?” 

“Can your engineers repair my 
Drive?” 

“I doubt it. They couldn’t 
change a fuse.” 

“What about a tow to 
Dhartana?” 

“Out of the question. Captain. 
But I can take you in to my own 
Base, on Skandia. The repair 
facilities there are excellent.” 

Grimes weighed matters care- 
fully before answering. Skandia, 
one of the small, independent king- 
doms, was barely on speaking 
terms with the Interstellar Federa- 
tion. At the very best the 
Skandians would charge heavily 
for the tow, would present a fan- 
tastically heavy bill for the repair 
work carried out by their yard. 
(But he. Grimes, would not be 
paying it.) At the worst. Adder and 
her people’ might be interned, 
could become the focus of a nasty 
little interstellar incident, a source 
of acute embarrassment to the 
Survey Service. And so. Grimes 
asked himself mutinously, whaP. 
That Promotion List had made 
him dangerously dissatisfied with 
his lot; the Commissioner had 
strained what loyalties remained to 
the breaking point. 

The Commissioner . 

“What exactly is going on here?” 
she asked coldly. 

She was getting into his hair 
again. 



WHAT YOU KNOW

“I’m arranging a tow,” Grimes 
told her. “The alternative is to 
hang here — ” he gestured towards 
the viewports, to the outside 
blackness, to the sharp, bright, 
unwinking, distant stars “in the 
middle of sweet damn all, thinking 
more and more seriously of can- 
nibalism with every passing day." 

“Very funny. Lieutenant.” She 
stared at the screen. “Is that officer 
wearing Skandian uniform?” 

“Of course. Madam,” replied 
the Skandian Captain, who seemed 
to be very quick on the uptake. 
“Captain Olaf Andersen, at your 
service.” He smiled happily. “And 
you, if I am not mistaken, are 
Mrs. Commissioner Dalwood, of 
the Federation’s Board of 
Admiralty. According to our 
latest Intelligence reports you are 
en route to Dhartana.” He smiled 
again. “Delete ‘are’. Substitute 
‘were.’ ” 

“Mr. Grimes, I forbid you to 
accept a tow from that ship.” 

“Mrs. Dalwood, as command- 
ing officer of this vessel 1 must do 
all I can to ensure her safety and 
that of her people.” 

“Mr. Slovotny, you will put 
through a call to Lindisfarne Base 
at once, demanding immediate 
assistance.” 

Slovotny looked appealingly at 
Grimes. Grimes nodded glumly. 
The grinning face of the Skandian 
faded from the screen, was 
replaced by a swirl of color as the 
pilot antenna swung away from its 



target. Sound came from the 
speaker — but it was a loud war- 
bling note only. 

The radio officer worked des- 
perately at the controls of the 
Carlotti transceiver. 

Then he looked up and an- 
nounced, “They’re jamming our 
signals; they have some very 
sophisticated equipment and 
they're only light-minutes distant.” 

“Are you sure you can’t get 
through?” demanded the Commis- 
sioner. 

“Quite sure,” Slovotny told her 
definitely. 

She snorted, turned to Hollister. 
“Mr. Hollister, I’ll have to rely on 
you.” 

“What about your own chrome- 
plated telepath?” Grimes asked her 
nastily. 

She glared at him. “John's trans- 
mission and reception is only rela- 
tively short range. And he can't 
work with an organic amplifier, as 
your Mr. Hollister can.” 

“And my organic amplifier's on 
the blink,” said Hollister. 

“What do you mean?” de- 
manded Grimes. 

The telepath explained patient- 
ly. “There has to be a relation- 
ship between a psionic commun- 
ications officer and his amplifier. 
The amplifier, of course, is a living 
dog's brain" 

“I know, 1 know,” the Commis- 
sioner snapped. “Get on with it.” 

Hollister would not be hurried. 
“The relationship is that which 



84 



GALAXY 




exists between a kind master and a 
faithful dog but deeper, much 
deeper. Normally we carry our 
own personal amplifiers with us, 
from ship to ship, but mine died 
recently, so 1 inherited Mr. 
Deane’s. I have been working 
hard, ever since I joined this ship, 
to win its trust, its affection. I was 
making headway, but I was unable 
to give it the feeling of security it 
needed when the temporal preces- 
sion field of the Drive started to 
fluctuate. The experience can be 
terrifying enough to a human be- 
ing who knows what is happening; 
it is even more terrifying to a dog. 
And so-” 

“And so?” 

“And so the amplifier is useless, 
possibly permanently.” He added 
brightly: “But 1 can get in touch 
with Princess Helga any time you 
want.” 

“You needn’t bother,” she 
snarled. Then, to Grimes, “Of all 
the ships in the Survey Service, 
why did I have to travel in this 
one?” 

fVhy? echoed Grimes silently. 
Why? 



E ven the commissioner was 
obliged to give Captain Ander- 
sen and his crew full marks for 
spacemanship. Princess Helga 
emerged into normal Space/Time 
only feet from the drifting Adder. 
At one moment there was nothing 
beyond the courier’s viewports but 



the blackness of interstellar space, 
the bright, distant stars — at the 
next moment she was there, a 
vague outline at first but 
solidifying rapidly. She hung there, 
a great spindle of gleaming plastic 
and metal, the sleekness of her 
lines marred by turrets and 
antennae. Another second — and 
the shape of her was obscured by 
the tough, pneumatic fenders that 
inflated with almost explosive 
rapidity. Another second — and 
Adders people heard and felt the 
thump of the magnetic grapnels as 
they made contact. 

Andersen’s pleasant, slightly ac- 
cented voice came from the trans- 
ceiver. “I have you. Captain. Stand 
by for acceleration. Stand by for 
resumption of Mannschenn Drive.” 
“I suppose that your temporal 
precession field will cover us?” 
asked Grimes. 

“Of course. In any case there is 
physical contact between your ship 
and mine.” 

“Where are you taking us?” de- 
manded Mrs. Dalwood. 

“To Kobenhaven, of course, 
Madam. Our Base on Skandia.” 

“I insist that you tow us to the 
nearest spaceport under Federa- 
tionjurisdiction.” 

“You insist. Madam?” Grimes, 
looking at the screen, could see 
that Andersen was really enjoying 
himself. “I’m sorry, but I have my 
orders.” 

“This is piracy!” 

“Piracy, Madam? The captain 



WHAT YOU KNOW 



85 




of your ship requested a tow and a 
tow is what he’s getting. Beggars 
can’t be choosers. In any case. 
Space Law makes it quite plain 
that the choice of destination is up 
to the officer commanding the 
vessel towing, not the captain of 
the vessel towed.” 

She said, almost pleading but 
not quite, “In these circum- 
stances the Federation could be 
generous.” 

Andersen lost his smile. He said, 
“I am a Skandian, Madam. My 
loyalty is to my own planet, my 
own Service. Stand by for 
acceleration.” 

The screen went blank. Accel- 
eration pushed the group in 
Adder’s control room down into 
their chairs; Mrs. Dalwood was 
able to reach a spare seat just in 
time. Faintly, the vibration trans- 
mitted along the tow wires, they 
heard and felt the irregular 
throbbing of Princess Helga’s 
inertial drive- and almost 
coincidentally there was a brief 
period of temporal/spatial 
disorientation as the field of the 
cruiser's Mannschenn Drive en- 
compassed both ships. 

“You realize what this means to 
your career,” said the Commis- 
sioner harshly. 

“What was that?” asked Grimes. 
He had been trying to work out 
how it was that Princess Helga had 
been able to start up her inertial 
drive before the interstellar drive, 
how it was that there had been no 



prior lining up on a target star. 

“You realize what this means to 
your career,” repeated the 
woman. 

“I haven’t got one,” said 
Grimes. “Not any longer.” 

And somehow it didn’t matter. 



HI 

T he voyage to Kobenhaven was 
not a pleasant one. 

The Commissioner made no at- 
tempt to conceal her feelings inso- 
far as Grimes was concerned. 
RosaleCn, he knew, was on his 
side — but what could a mere lady’s 
maid do to help him? She could 
have done quite a lot to make him 
less miserable, but her mistress 
made sure that there were no 
opportunities. The officers re- 
mained loyal but not too loyal. 
They had their own careers to think 
about. As long as Grimes was cap- 
tain they were obliged to take his 
orders and the Commissioner 
knew it as well as they did. Oddly 
enough, it was only Hollister, the 
newcomer, the misfit, who showed 
any sympathy. But he knew, more 
than any of the others, what had 
been going on - what was going on 
in Grimes’ mind. 

At last the two ships broke out 
into normal Space/Time Just clear 
of Skandia’s Van Allens. This 
Andersen, Grimes admitted 
glumly to himself, was a navigator 
and shiphandler of no mean order.

He said as much into the 
transceiver. The little image of the 
Skandian captain in the screen 
grinned out at him cheerfully. 

“Just the normal standards of 
the Royal Skandian Navy, 
Captain. I’m casting you off, now. 
I’ll follow you in. Home on the 
Kobenhaven Base beacon.” He 
grinned again. “And don’t try any- 
thing.” 

“What can I try?” countered 
Grimes with a grin of his own. 

“I don’t know. But I’ve heard 
about you. Lieutenant Grimes. 
You have the reputation of being 
able to wriggled out of anything.” 

“I’m afraid I’m losing my repu- 
tation, Captain.” Grimes, through 
the viewports, watched the 
magnetic grapnels withdraw into 
their recesses in Princess Helga's 
hull. He and Andersen applied 
lateral thrust simultaneously. As 
the vessels surged apart the 
fenders were deflated, sucked back 
into their sockets. 

Adder, obedient to her captain’s 
will, commenced her descent to- 
wards the white and gold, green 
and blue sphere that was Skandia. 
She handled well, as well as 
Grimes had ever known her to do. 
But this was probably the last time 
that he would be handling this 
ship, any ship. The Commis- 
sioner would see to that. He 
shrugged. Well, he would make the 
most of it, would try to enjoy it. He 
saw that Beadle and Von Tannen- 
baum and Slovotny were looking 



at him apprehensively. He 
laughed. He could guess what they 
were thinking. 

“Don’t worry,” he told them. 
“I’ve no intention of going out in a 
blaze of glory. And now. Sparks, 
do you think you could lock on to 
that beacon for me?” 

“Ay, Captain,” Slovotny re- 
plied. And then, blushing absurd- 
ly, “It’s a damn shame, sir.” 

“It will all come right in the 
end,” said Grimes with a convic- 
tion that he did not feel. He 
shrugged again. At least that cast- 
iron bitch and her tin boy friends 
weren’t in Control to ruin the 
bitter-sweetness of what, all too 
probably, would be his last 
pilotage. 

Adder fell straight and true, 
plunging into the atmosphere, 
countering every crosswind with 
just the right application of lateral 
thrust. Below her, continents and 
seas expanded, features — rivers, 
forests,, mountains and cities — 
showed with increasing clarity. 

And there was the spaceport, 
and there the triangle of brilliant 
winking lights, in the center of 
which Grimes was to land his ship. 
He brought her down fast — and 
saw apprehension dawning again 
on the faces of his officers. He 
brought her down fast — and then, 
at almost the last possible second, 
fed the power into his inertial drive 
unit. She shuddered and hung 
there, scant inches above the con- 
certe of the apron. And then the 



WHAT YOU KNOW 



87 




irregular throbbing slowed, and 
stopped, and Adder was down, 
with barely a complaint from the 
shock absorbers. 

“Finish with engines,” said 
Grimes quietly. 

He looked through the ports at 
the soldiers who had surrounded 
the ship. 

“Are we under arrest. Cap- 
tain?” asked Von Tannenbaum. 

“Just a guard of honor for the 
Commissioner,” said Grimes 
tiredly. 

G RIMES’ remark was not in- 
tended to be taken seriously — 
but it wasn’t too far from the 
mark. The soldiers were, actually, 
members of the Royal Bodyguard 
and they did, eventually, escort 
Mrs. Commissioner Dalwood to 
the Palace. But that was not until 
after the King himself had been re- 
ceived aboard Adder with all due 
courtesy, or such courtesy as could 
be mustered by Grimes and his of- 
ficers after a hasty reading of 
Dealings With Foreign Dignitaries. 
General Instructions. 

Grimes, of course, could have 
appealed to the Commissioner 
for advice; she moved in diplomatic 
circles and he did not. 

As long as I'm Captain of this 
ship I’ll stand on my own two 
feet . 

Luckily the Port Authorities 
had given him warning that His 
Skandian Majesty would be 
making a personal call on board. 



He was a big young man, this 
King Eric, heavily muscled, with 
ice-blue eyes, a flowing yellow 
moustache, long, wavy yellow hair. 
Over baggy white trousers that 
were thrust into boots of unpol- 
ished leather he wore a short- 
sleeved shirt of gleaming chain 
mail. On his head was, a horned 
helmet. He carried a short battle- 
axe. The officers with him — with 
the exception of Captain Andersen 
whose own ship was now down — 
were similarly uniformed, although 
the horns of their helmets were 
shorter, their ceremonial axes 
smaller. Andersen was in conven- 
tional enough space captain’s dress 

rig- 

Grimes’ little day cabin was 
uncomfortably crowded. There was 
the King, with three of his high 
officers. There was Andersen. 
There was, of course, the Com- 
missioner and she had brought her 
faithful robot, John, with her. Only 
King Eric and Mrs. Dalwood were 
seated. 

John, Grimes admitted, had his 
uses. He mixed and served drinks 
like a stage butler. He passed 
around cigarettes, cigarillos and 
cigars. And Mrs. Dalwood had 
her uses. Grimes was not used to 
dealing with royalty, with human 
royalty, but she was. Her manner, 
as she spoke to the King, was kind 
but firm. Without being disre- 
spectful she managed to convey 
the impression that she ranked 
with, but slightly above, the great- 



88 



GALAXY 




grandson of a piratical tramp 
skipper. At first Grimes feared 
(hoped) that one of those 
ceremonial but sharp axes would 
he brought into play — but, oddly 
enough, King Eric seemed to be 
enjoying the situation. 

“So you see. Your Majesty,” 
said the Commissioner, “that it is 
imperative that I resume my 
journey to Dhartana as soon as 
possible. I realize that this vessel 
will be delayed until the necessary 
repairs have been effected, so I 
wonder if 1 could charter one of 
your ships.” She added: “I have the 
necessary authority.” 

Eric blew silky fronds of 
moustache away from his thick 
lips. “We do not question that. 
Madam Commissioner. But you 
must realize that We take no action 
without due consultation with 
Our advistors. Furthermore — ” he 
looked like a small boy screwing 
up his courage before being saucy 
to the schoolteacher — “We do not 
feel obliged to go out of Our way to 
render assistance to your Federa- 
tion.” 

“The Princess Ingaret incident 
was rather unfortunate. Your 
Majesty,” admitted Mrs. 
Dalwood sweetly. “But I never 
thought that the Skandians were 
the sort of people to bear 
grudges.” 

“We are not. Madam Commis- 
sioner. But a monarch, these days, 
is servant to as well as leader of his 
people . .” 



Grimes saw the generals, or 
whatever they were, exchanging 
ironical glances with Captain 
Andersen. 

“But, Your Majesty, it is to our 
common benefit that friendly rela- 
tions between Skandia and the 
Federation be reestablished.” 

Friendly relations? She looks as 
though she wants to take him to 
bed. And he knows it .. 

“Let me suggest. Madam Com- 
missioner, that you do 
me — Us — the honor of becoming 
Our guest? At the Palace you will 
be able to meet the Council of 
Earls as soon as it can be con- 
vened. 1 have no doubt We have no 
doubt that such a conference will 
be to the lasting benefit of both 
Our realms.” 

“Thank you. Your Majesty. We 
are — ” She saw Grimes looking at 
her sardonically and actually 
blushed. “I am honored.” 

“It should not be necessary for 
you to bring your aides or your 
own servants,” said King Eric. 

“I shall bring John and James,” 
she told him. “They are my robot 
servitors.” 

Eric, whose face had fallen, 
looked cheerful again. “Then We 
shall see that all is ready for you.” 
He turned to one of his officers. 
“General, please inform the 
Marshal of the Household that 
Madam Commissioner Dalwood 
is to be Our guest.” 

The general raised his wrist 
transceiver to his bearded lips.

softly passed on the instructions. 

“John,” ordered the Commis- 
sioner, “tell Miss Rosaleen and 
James to pack for me. Miss Rosa- 
leen will know what I shall re- 
quire.” 

“Yes, Madam,” replied the 
robot, standing there. He was not 
in telepathic communication 
with his metal brother — but UHF 
radio was as good. 

“Oh, Your Majesty — ” 

“Yes, Madam Commission- 
er?” 

“What arrangements are being 
made for Lieutenant Grimes and 
his officers — and for my lady's 
maid? Presumably this ship will be 
under repair shortly and they will 
be unable to live aboard.” 

“M rs. Dalwood.” Grimes did 
not try very hard to keep his rising 
resentment from showing, “May 
I remind you that I am captain of 
Adder‘s And may I remind you that 
Regulations insist that there must 
be a duty officer aboard at all times 
in foreign ports?” 

“And may 1 remind you, Mr. 
Grimes, that an Admiral of the 
Fleet or a civilian officer of the 
Board of Admiralty with 
equivalent rank can order the sus- 
pension of any or all of the 
Regulations? Furthermore, as 
such a civilian officer, I know that 
nothing aboard your ship, arma- 
ment, propulsive units or com- 
munications equipment, is on the 
Secret List. You need not fear that 
our hosts’ technicians will learn 



anything at all to their advan- 
tage.” She added, too sweetly; “Of 
course, you might learn from 
them.” 

King Eric laughed gustily. “And 
that is why We must insist. 
Lieutenant, that neither you nor 
your officers are aboard while re- 
pairs are in progress. Captain 
Andersen, please make arrange- 
ments for the accommodation of 
the Terran officers.” 

“Ay, Your Majesty,” replied 
Andersen smartly. He looked at 
Grimes and said without words. 
I’m sorry, spaceman, hut that’s 
the way it has to be. 

G rimes and his officers were 
housed in the Base’s Bachelor 
Officers’ Quarters and Rosaleen 
was accommodated in the bar- 
racks where the female petty 
officers lived. They weren’t 
prisoners — quite. They were 
guests but strictly supervised 
guests. They were not allowed near 
their own ship and that hurt. They 
were not allowed near any of the 
ships in addition to Princess 
Helga and Adder three destroyers, 
a transport and two tugs were in 
port. Captain Andersen, who 
seemed to have been given the job 
of looking after them, was 
apologetic. 

“But 1 have to remember that 
you’re spacemen. Lieutenant. And 
1 have to remember that you have 
the reputation of being a some- 
what unconventional spaceman. 



90

with considerable initiative.” He 
laughed shortly. “I shudder to 
think what would happen if you 
and your boys flew the coop in any 
of the wagons — yours or 

ours that are berthed around the 
place.” 

Grimes sipped moodily from his 
beer glass — he and Andersen 
were having a drink and chat in the 
well-appointed wardroom of the 
B.O.Q. He said, 

“There’s not much chance of our 
doing that, sir. You must remem- 
ber that the Commissioner is my 
passenger and that I am 
responsible for her. I could not pos- 
sibly leave without her.” 

“Much as you dislike her?” An- 
dersen grinned. “1 think she is 
quite capable of looking after her- 
self.” 

“1 know that she is. Captain. 
Even so — ” 

“If you’re thinking of rescuing 
her- ” 

“I’m not,” Grimes told him. He 
had seen the Palace from the out- 
side, a grim, gray pile that looked 
as though it had been transported, 
through Space and Time, from 
Shakespeare’s Elsinore. But there 
was nothing archaic about its de- 
fenses and it was patrolled by well- 
armed guards who looked at least 
as tough as the Federation’s 
Marines. He went on almost 
incuriously; “I suppose that she’s 
being well treated.” 

“I have heard that His Majesty 
is most hospitable.” 



“Mphm. Well, we certainly can’t 
complain, apart from a certain lack 
of freedom. Mind you, Mr. Beadle 
is whinging a bit. He finds your 
local wenches a bit too robust for 
his taste. He prefers small 
brunettes to great, strapping 
blondes. But your people have 
certainly put on some good parties 
for us. And Rosaleen was telling 
me that she’s really enjoying her- 
self — the P.O.s’ mess serves all the 
fattening things she loves with 
every meal.” 

“Another satisfied customer,” 
said Andersen. 

“But I'm not satisfied. Captain. 

1 know damn well that the repairs 
to my Mannschenn Drive took no 
more than a day. How long are we 
being held here?” 

“That, Lieutenant, is a matter 
for my masters and yours. 
We and our ships--are no more 
than pawns on the board.” The 
Captain looked at his watch. 
“Talking of ships, I have some 
business aboard Princess Helga. 
You must excuse me.” He finished 
his beer and got to his feet. “Don’t 
forget that after lunch you’re all 
being taken for a sail on the Skag- 
gerak.” 

“I’ll not forget, sir,” Grimes in- 
formed him. 

He was, in fact, looking forward 
to it. He enjoyed the sailing 
excursions in stout little wooden 
ships as much as any Skandian, 
already had proved himself 
capable of handling a schooner

under a full press of canvas quite 
competently, was realizing that 
seamanship and spacemanship, 
the skilled balancing of physical 
forces, have much in common. 

He sat down again when 
Andersen had left the almost 
deserted wardroom, saw Hollister 
coming toward him. 

The telepath said in a low voice, 
“I'm afraid you won’t be taking 
that sail. Captain.” 

Grimes was going to make some 
cutting remark about psionic 
snooping, then thought better of 
it. 

“Why not, Mr. Hollister?” 

The psionic communications 
officer grinned wryly. “Yes, I’ve 
been snooping. Captain. I admit 
it. I’ve maintained contact of a 
sort with John 

“The tin telepath?” 

“You can call him that. He’s 
very lonely in the Palace, and he’s 
going to be lonelier.” 

“What the hell are you talking 
about?” 

“The Commissioner has been 
getting along very well with the 
King. She has persuaded him to 
release us, even though the Coun- 
cil of Earls is not altogether in 
approval. We should get the word 
this afternoon and be on our way 
shortly afterward. Adder is com- 
pletely spaceworthy.” 

“1 know. Captain Andersen as 
good as told me. But why is John 
so lonely that he’s spilling all these 
beans to you?” 



“She wanted to make a farewell 
gift to His Majesty- and he, it 
seems, has always wanted a robot 
valet. Humanoid robots are not 
manufactured on Skandia, as you 
know.” 

“And so John’s been sold down 
'the river. My heart fair bleeds for 
him.” 

“No, Captain. Not John- 
James. John’s ‘brother.’ They think 
of each other as brothers. They 
feel affection, a very real affection, 
for each other.” 

“Incredible.” 

“Is it. Captain? I’ve heard about 
the Mr. Adam affair and how a 
mere machine was loyal io you." 

“Then not so incredible.” 

One of the wall speakers 
crackled into life. “Will Lieutenant 
Grimes, captain of the Federation 
Survey Service Courier Adder, 
please come at once to telephone 
booth fourteen? Will Lieutenant 
Grimes, captain of the Federation 
Survey Service Courier Adder, 
please come at once to telephone 
booth fourteen?” 

“Coming,” grumbled Grimes. 

He was not surprised to see An- 
dersen’s face in the little screen, to 
hear him say, “Orders from the 
Palace, Lieutenant. You’re to get 
your show on the road at fifteen 
hours Local. Mrs. Dalwood will 
board at fourteen-thirty. You, your 
officers, and Miss Rosaleen Boyle 
will board at thirteen-thirty. You 
will find all in order, all in 
readiness.”

“Thank you, Captain.” 

Andersen grinned. “Don’t thank 
me. Thank His Majesty — or Com- 
missioner Dalwood.” 

Grimes returned to the table 
where he had left Hollister. 

He said, “You were right.” 

“Of course I was right. And 
now, if I may. I’ll give you a 
warning.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Watch John. Watch him very 
carefully. He’s bitter, vengeful.” 
“Are you in touch with him 
now?” 

“Yes.” The telepath’s face had 
the faraway expression that made 
it obvious that he was engaged in 
conversation with a distant entity. 
Suddenly he smiled. “It’s all right. 
He has assured me that even 
though he feels that Mrs. Dalwood 
has betrayed him and his brother 
he is quite incapable of physically 
harming any human being. The 
built-in safeguards are too strong 
for him to overcome.” 

“Then that’s all right.” Grimes 
knew that he should be worrying 
nonetheless — but the Commis- 
sioner was a big girl and could look 
after herself. And how could the 
robot harm her in any way but 
physically? “You’ve been snooping 
in its — his — mind, so you know 
how he ticks.” 

“Yes, Captain.” 

Grimes strode to the reception 
desk and asked the attractive, 
blond petty officer to have Adder’s 
crew paged. 



M rs. dalwood looked well. 

She had softened somehow and 
seemed to have put on a little 
weight — although not as much as 
Rosaleen. She sat at ease in her 
day room, admiring the beautiful, 
jewel-encrusted watch that now 
adorned her left wrist. Grimes sat 
on the edge of his chair, watching 
her, waiting for her to speak. To 
one side stood the robot John, 
silent, immobile. 

“Well, Lieutenant,” she said, 
not too unpleasantly, “you man- 
aged to get us upstairs without any 
major catastrophe. I hope that we 
shall reach our destination in a 
reasonably intact condition. We 
should. As you must have noticed, 
the work carried out by the Skan- 
dian technicians is of excellent 
quality. Like this watch.” She 
turned her wrist so that Grimes 
could see it properly. “It seems 
strange that a robust people such as 
the Skandians, space Vikings, 
should be such outstanding watch- 
smiths — but they are, as you prob- 
ably know. His Majesty insisted 
that I accept this keepsake from 
him.” 

Grimes said nothing. 

The Commissioner continued: 
“Yes. Things could have been 
worse. Much worse, as it turned 
out. His Majesty and I reached an 
understanding. Together we 
accomplished more, much more, 
than the so-called diplomats.” 

I can imagine it, thought 
Grimes — and to his surprise ex-

perienced a twinge of sexual 
jealousy. 

Her manner stiffened. “But 
don’t think, Mr. Grimes, that I 
shall not be putting in a full report 
on your conduct. It is my duty as a 
Commissioner to do so. I cannot 
forget that you gave me your 
resignation.” 

Suddenly John spoke. He said 
tonelessly, “He is thinking of 
you.” 

The Commissioner seemed to 
forget that Grimes was present. 
Her face softened again. “He is? 
Tell me ” 

“He misses you. Madam. He is 
thinking, / really loved her. She re- 
minded me so much of my dear old 
mother.” 

Grimes laughed. He couldn’t 
help it. Mrs. Dalwood screamed 
furiously, “Be silent, John. I for- 
bid you to speak, ever, unless 
spoken to by me.” 

“Yes, Madam.” 

“And as for you, Mr. Grimes, 
you heard nothing.” 

Grimes looked at her, into the 
eyes that were full of appeal. He re- 
membered what he had heard of 
Mrs. Commissioner Dalwood 
before ever he had the misfortune 
to meet her. The beautiful Mrs. 
Dalwood, the proud Mrs. Dal- 
wood, the so-called femme fatale of 
the Admiralty who could, and did, 
compete with much younger 
women on equal terms. In a less 
permissive society she could 
never have attained her high rank; 



in Earth’s past she could have be- 
come a King’s courtesan. 

And in Skandia’s present? 

Grimes said softly, “Of course. 
King Eric is very young.” 

“Mr. Grimes, you heard 
nothing.” 

He could not resist the appeal in 
her voice, the very real charm. 

/ may not be an officer much 
longer, but I’ll still try to be a 
gentleman. 

He said, “I heard nothing.” 

C OMMODORE DAMIEN 
looked at Grimes over his desk, 
over the skeletal fingers with 
which he had made the too-familiar 
steeple. He said, without regret, 
“So I shall be losing you. Grimes.’’ 
“Yes, sir.” 

“Frankly, I was surprised.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“But not altogether pained.” 
Grimes wasn’t sure how to take 
this. He said nothing. 

“Tomorrow morning. Grimes, 
you hand over your command to 
Lieutenant Beadle. I think that he 
deserves his promotion.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“But how did you do it. Grimes? 
Don’t tell me that. No. She’s not 
your type, nor you hers.” 

“You can say that again, sir.” 

“It can’t be what you do. It can’t 
be what you know. It must be 
whom you know 

Or what you know about whom, 
thought Lieutenant Commander 
Grimes a little smugly. ★

T he Dragon God stood on a 
small rise at the end of the field. 
Its proud blind head with the 
gleaming teeth stood tall, watch- 
ing over the welfare of the Valley 
and all the Smifs in it. The bright 
iron of the ancient structure 
glowed under the layer of sacrifi- 
cial goose grease and butter that 
the Smifs had rubbed over it. 

Smiftu kneeled before it, right 
knee on the haft of his spade, pray- 
ing. He prayed the old prayer, the 
words his mother had taught him. 

“O God, whose roar shook the 
Valley, whose head bit the earth it- 
self with the bite of the hundred 
hundred spades of a hundred hun- 
dred Smifs, deliver my child from 
fever.” 

He opened his eyes and looked 
up and made the cupped hand sign 
of the Dragon God. And at the 
same time he checked to all sides 
for marauders seeking to steal 
his spade. His child would most 
likely die. That was bearable; 
three of his other children had al- 
ready died. That was life. Children 
were born usually ten moons after 
Schnoppsday. They lived a little 
while and they died. But so long as 
a man had his own spade, life 
would go on. 

Spadelessness was death. 

From the corner of his eye he 
made out the skulking rag-cov- 
ered figure of Smifive. Resolute- 
ly he laid both his knees upon his 
spade and went on with his pray- 
ers. He did not think they would 



help but he had promised his wom- 
an that he would offer sacrifice. 
He wished he could believe in 
prayer the way the women did, 
the way old mumbling Smiften 
used to before he died. It must be 
comforting. To forget the stoop- 
shouldered agony of working the 
field with his spade. To put aside 
the cold and the hunger in some in- 
ner joy, some secret exaltation 
shared with the Dragon God as He 
stood brooding endlessly on His 
Mound above the tater crop. 

Smiftv’s knees began to ache but 
he stayed in his place, punishing 
himself for his godlessness. 

The Dragon God had never 
been good to him. His prayers had 
never been answered. And today 
he was going to sacrifice the last 
fat in the house, the scraped and 
hoarded renderings of a wood- 
chuck he had killed with his spade. 
He would rub it on the bare teeth of 
the Dragon God so they would not 
go red with anger. 

The old spade chiefs said that 
sacrifice placated the anger of 
the Dragon God. Smiftu did not 
believe them. It was a sacrifice 
that the porcupines and the skunks 
and the barefooted spadeless Smifs 
came and claimed, licked from the 
iron in the night. Within a few days 
all trace would be gone and the 
Dragon God would start to turn 
red in his anger. 

The Dragon God. The Dragon 
God. The words taunted him. The 
Dragon God took all and gave

nothing. Took their grease and 
took every Sandday of their lives. 
Took a whole dawn-to-dusk day of 
rubbing with the bright sand from 
the creek until His redness went 
away and He was ready for the 
Sandday anointing with the grease 
that all had gathered. 

T he flying body hit Smiftu 
from behind and threw him 
face down but he was quick. His 
left hand grabbed his spade, his 
right flew forward and down to 
roll him free so that he came up 
fighting, left and right hands grip- 
ping the center of the man-tall 
spade haft, ready to cut or parry. 
But there was no need. Smifive fled 
in a flutter of rags, old and dull 
and frightened. Smiftu did not 
pursue him, did not even shout. To 
do so would profane the sanctity 
of the shrine and there was noth- 
ing to be gained. Smifive was 
spadeless. Soon he would die. 

Smiftu reached in the front of his 
jerkin and took out the wood- 
chuck bladder of grease hanging 
around his neck on the sinew. 
Slowly and regretfully he 
squeezed the grease on to his fin- 
gers. He licked it quickly, telling 
himself he was doing so only to 
let his hunger double the impor- 
tance of his sacrifice. He swal- 
lowed his saliva and worked away, 
standing tall, smearing and 
kneading the grease with his left 
hand, right hand holding his spade 
at the point of balance. 



Out in the field one or two of the 
more devout Smifs stopped work 
and raised their cupped hands in 
the Dragon God sign. They 
thought it was a good omen to have 
a Smif giving sacrifice on the 
very morning of Schnoppsday. It 
was especially good that Smiftu 
was the one making sacrifice. 
Smiftu was a rich man. His was 
the only one-press spade in the 
Valley. Deep it was, deeper than it 
was wide, so that one push of a 
man’s heel would turn up enough 
ground for taters. Most of the 
other Smifs had two-press spades, 
worn down to half their height, so a 
man’s work was doubled. Some of 
the older men had spades worn 
down to three-press shallowness. 
You could pick them out at a dis- 
tance by the way they worked, 
pumping their spades three times 
with their heels as they worried the 
soil over. 

Smiftu felt a moment of pride 
as he stood there, poised tall, his 
spade in his hand and his own per- 
sonal sacrifice greasing the jaws 
of the God. He was a spade chief 
and a good Smif. Perhaps the God 
would listen and the spots on his 
son’s face would pass from red to 
white and turn into little holes 
and the fever would go away. 
Sometimes it happened. It had 
happened to him. 

And if it did not, he would ask 
the Schnopps Lord for help. The 
Schnopps Lord was coming this 
day. Looksmif had seen him at the 



SCHNOPPSDAY 



97 




end of the Valley. He would come 
and bring all the Smifs together 
from up and down the Valley. He 
would make marks on a fine white 
skin and he would give a horn of 
schnopps to all the men and wom- 
en. Then he would take down the 
sweebarrel and let all the chil- 
dren reach out a double handful 
of the running yellow sweetness. 
And by then the schnopps would 
make the walls of the Valley swim 
and tumble and the Smifs would 
laugh and dance and fight and love 
their women on the bare ground. 
And when they awoke the 
great lord would be gone, leav- 
ing rolls of gingham cloth and 
sometimes, if the woman he had 
loved had pleased him, he would 
leave a spade. It would be new and 
tall and the virgin who was not a 
virgin would claim it for her own. 
And the young Smifs would fight 
and the winner would take the 
spade and the girl and the yellow- 
haired baby she would have in the 
snow time. 

Smiftu stood back and made the 
dragon sign, then turned indif- 
ferently and walked away to his 
own strip to tend his taters and 
beans. His was a good strip, 
crumbly red soil that made the ta- 
ters grow big. This gave him room 
for the luxury of beans. Too 
precious to be eaten as they grew, 
they would be plucked and dried 
for Smiftu and his woman to chew 
in snow time. He went to work at 
once, working left-handed while 



he licked the last traces of grease 
from his right fingers. His spade 
jumped and danced over the 
ground, kicking away the lares 
that sucked the goodness from his 
soil. 

He liked to watch the shiny 
spade twisting and turning, it 
soothed him and made him forget 
the stiffness of his back and the 
emptiness of his belly. And yet his 
mind was restless. The other spade 
chiefs said he was wise. He looked 
into things and through things. He 
did not say all the things he 
thought. Once he had stood up in 
the council and said the sides of the 
Dragon God would make many 
spades. For that they might have 
stoned him. But they had done 
nothing. While his children grew 
sick and died, while his woman had 
blood in her mouth from cough- 
ing, the old ones did nothing. 

Why? Why did none of them lift 
his head from his own strip and 
look beyond the Valley? Perhaps 
there was meat there, many wood- 
chucks. Perhaps there was good 
soil, like his strip. But they said 
that this was their Valley, another 
Valley was for other Smifs. They 
did nothing, nor did they look for 
answers from the Schnopps Lord. 
They were afraid and Smiftu felt 
anger in his heart and he made his 
resolution. Today he would ask 
the Schnopps Lord for help. 

As he made his plan he heard the 
first shouts of welcome from the 
huts at the end of the Valley. He

turned, like all the other Smifs, and 
saw the Schnopps Lord on his 
wagon drawn by great beasts pull- 
ing slowly along the edge of the ta- 
ter strips toward the meeting 
place in front of the Dragon God. 

With all the other Smifs from 
the fields he waved his spade and 
shouted and ran in clumsy hob- 
bling leaps over the growing tater 
plants toward the Schnopps Lord. 

C ENSUS-MAN Second Class 
Serov flourished his whip at the 
Smiths and clucked his team into a 
trot. All who could walk or drag 
themselves were drawn into the 
wagon’s wake like the screaming 
tail of a horsedrawn comet. He did 
not need to go twice around the 
settlement, as was suggested in 
the Census-man’s manual. He 
needed only to ring his bell and 
pull his wagon up to the low 
mound where the antique power 
shovel stood. Serov grinned when 
he saw it. All traces of paint were 
long since gone but the metal 
gleamed like a knife blade under 
the layer of evil-smelling grease 
the Smiths had rubbed on it. Real- 
ly, these valley morons were too 
much, spending one day in ten 
scraping the shovel down with 
river sand. Still, it was not as 
amusing here as in Kellyvalley, 
fifty kilometers back. Those 
dizzy bastards worshiped a Mack 
Truck. 

He stopped the wagon and 
stood up tall on it while he looped 



the reins around the brake lever. 
The instructors at Census School 
had always stressed that. Make the 
most of your height. Stay high and 
aloof and you’ll never have trouble. 
Serov did not anticipate trouble. 
He eased his Luger in the low-slung 
holster he had made for himself 
and swelled his chest. It was easy to 
imagine himself a U.S. Marshal 
at times like this. Serov knew all 
about U.S. Marshals. His doctor- 
al thesis had been on the subject 
of camp culture of the mid-twenti- 
eth century. He had seen all the 
western movies and TV shows to 
be found in the Museum of Primi- 
tive Arts. Because he was young 
and impressionable, despite his 
education he liked to model him- 
self on one Matt Dillon. He would 
have liked a Peacemaker .45 on 
his hip instead of the issue Luger, 
but this was impossible. Guns 
were illegal except for the 
admittedly old-fashioned wea- 
pons issued to front line men like 
himself. 

He waited silently, not moving 
until the last whimpering of anti- 
cipation had died away, while the 
Smiths gathered in front of him. 

“Dobri dyen,” he said at last and 
waited while the formless roar of 
reply broke and subsided. 

“Where is the chief Smif?’’ he 
asked and the crowd parted to let 
the feeble old man come through. 
He was toothless and almost 
blind and his hair and beard were 
matted. He was dressed in a pair of 



SCHNOPPSDAY 



99 




shorts and a leather coat-liner that 
looked to Serov like British army 
issue. That might be so, he decid- 
ed. Smith was an English name 
and the Smiths of this valley might 
have had ancestors in that 
Imperial army. 

He let the old man stand for a 
moment, then said, “Happy 
Schnoppsday, Smif.” 

The old man bobbed his head 
and cackled. “Happy Schnopps- 
day, Lord”. 

“Are all the Smifs here?” Serov 
kept his voice low and firm, enough 
like Matt Dillon for him to have 
blushed to have his City friends 
hear him. 

“Smififteen is sick. He will die 
today and Smifive’s woman is in 
labor she will be here soon,” the 
old man said. 

“Good. There will be schnopps 
this day for every Smif.” 

All the male Smiths were lining 
up in spade seniority. First was 
Smiftu, spade in hand, adenoidal 
mouth gaping slightly. He was 
tall for a savage, over five feet and 
he was dressed in woodchuck 
pelts, which marked him out as a 
resourceful man. 

Such men are dangerous, Serov 
thought. He debated whether to 
take away Smiftu’s spade, doom- 
ing him to starvation once the 
present potato harvest was gath- 
ered. However, some echoed kind- 
liness from his television folk 
tales stopped him. He would allow 
the savage to keep his weapon. 



After all, he was doomed anyway. 
Judging by the muster this morn- 
ing the population had dropped 
another twenty percent through 
the winter. The Experiment was 
succeeding and anyway he had 
work to do. The bribe that brought 
the Smifs out of hiding must be 
paid and, as always, the census had 
to be taken. 

He picked up the pink plastic 
cup from the wagon bed and 
turned to the wooden alcohol keg 
on its trestle behind him. He 
opened the spigot and let four 
ounces of the clear neat spirit run 
into the cup. The smell of it was al- 
most enough to make him gag. 
Raw synthetic spirit, by-product 
of a refinery. Originally, a hun- 
dred and twenty years ago, when 
the experiment began, the spirit 
had been rum, good rum. Over the 
years, however, since the 
Experiment was working as well in 
the Carribean as it was on the 
mainland, rum was no longer 
produced. In its stead came the 
synthetics, potent blinding 
chemicals with the power to wash 
away a year’s worth of hunger 
and sickness in two gulps. He pre- 
sumed that one of the previous 
census-men in this valley had been 
German or Jewish and had used 
the foreign appellation for the 
spirit that was known as gin or vod- 
ka or even viski in other valleys. 
Personally he liked the word 
schnopps, it was so perfectly non- 
specific. 



TOO 



GALAXY 




H e turned and faced the 
crowd. The brown, hungry face 
of Smiftu looked up at him from 
the side of the wagon. Serov held 
the plastic cup for a few seconds 
longer, relishing the desire in the 
faces about him. God! He was 
king. Standing there with a few 
ounces of oblivion in his hands. 
No wonder so many census-men 
went AWOL every year. They 
couldn’t give up the feeling of 
power. Nobody ever missed 
them, of course. It was presumed 
that they had died. Within the air- 
conditioned silence of the City 
no one could imagine a census- 
man going native. They didn’t 
know the power a few ounces of 
spirit and a few spades bestowed 
upon a man out in the valleys and 
they were too occupied with the 
satisfactions of the New Leisure 
to try to find out. 

After all, one could not be tele- 
ported into the Valleys, one had to 
move physically. In fact, now that 
the last of the old helicopters 
were rusting from lack of use, a 
horse and wagon was the only way 
to get anywhere outside the Cities 
and none of the manicured City 
Dwellers would descend to such a 
barbarous method of transpor- 
tation. That was only for the few 
restless souls like himself who 
had volunteered for census work. 

He handed down the plastic cup, 
ceremonially known as the 
“Horn” among the Smifs. But 
Smiftu did not take it. Instead his 



pleading, broken-toothed mouth 
opened in clumsy speech. 

“Lord. Many Smifs say you 
come from a far land, from City.” 

“True,” Serov said impatiently. 

“Lord, it is said that many 
schnoppsy things happen in City. 
That men do not grow old, that 
children do not die of spotted 
fever.” 

“Speak your mind, Smiftu,” 
Serov said sternly and a worried 
whisper ran through the crowd. 
What was Smiftu doing? Why did 
he insult the Lord Schnopps with 
talk? 

Smiftu turned and glanced back, 
silencing them all with the re- 
flected power of his one-press 
spade. “Lord, my son is sick with 
spotted fever. I have prayed to 
Dragon God but the fever re- 
mains. Does the Lord have pa- 
tience to cast oiit the fever?” 

This son of a bitch was thinking. 

Serov frowned. That was bad. The 

■* 

last thing he wanted on this circuit 
was a noble savage. That had been 
the selling point for the Experi- 
ment when it began, of course, to 
shift the indigent unemployed 
townspeople out where they could 
work for their own living. And 
they’d bought it. They had come 
out into a well advertised, care- 
fully euphemized wilderness to 
eat bread by the sweat of their own 
brows. It had all been so cynically 
done: why, they had even been as- 
signed to their areas alphabetical- 
ly. And once they had been isolat- 



SCHNOPPSDAY 



101 




ed there it had been easy to exploit 
them or to starve them out, as the 
economy demanded, to withdraw 
fuel for their machines, drugs, 
seeds, tools, and watch them re- 
vert into helpless savages. There 
had been uprisings of course, re- 
peated time after time until the 
original settlers had died and only 
their children were left, dealing 
with an inadequate environ- 
ment, without energy to move out 
of their Valleys. Only once in a 
while did an aberration like 
Smiftu break through, some sa- 
vage with a high enough IQ to 
think for himself. Such had to be 
dealt with summarily. 

Serov stood taller, looking out 
over Smiftu’s head. “This Smif an- 
gers me. There will be no schnopps 
for this Smif. There will be no 
schnopps for any Smif who listens 
to this idle talk. The Dragon God 
protects all. Let no Smif doubt the 
Dragon God’s power.” 

The Smifs mumbled and 
shuffled. After they had drunk they 
would stone Smiftu. They would 
seize the opportunity to kill him 
and strip him of his spade and of 
his garden. Sacrificially Serov 
poured the schnopps upon the 
ground. Then he filled the cup 
again and passed it to the next man 
in line. The man crooked his tall 
spade in his elbow and drained the 
schnopps in two bursting gulps. 
And then the next man was push- 
ing him aside, raising his own 
arms in his turn. Serov counted 



mentally as he doled out the 
schnopps. The adult males here 
were down by 25%, counting Smif- 
ifteen who was dying and Smiftu 
who was doomed once the hang- 
overs had worn off and reality 
faced the Smifs again tomorrow. 
A decrease since last year. The 
Valley had long since ceased to be 
productive, had become trouble- 
some. 

E FINISHED with the men 
and poured spirit for the 
women, flappy-breasted dirty 
witches, for whom he had nothing 
but contempt. Conceived on noon 
of some previous Schnoppsday, 
resented even before their birth, 
the savage women had nothing 
noble or desirable about them. 
When one contrasted them with 
the plastic-bosomed adornments 
of any City dweller’s harem . 
However there was one little ur- 
chin who attracted him. She would 
be about thirteen, Serov judged, 
with breasts beginning to swell. 
She would do for today, he decid- 
ed. When she came forward for 
her schnopps, her first schnopps, 
he judged, he touched her upon the 
shoulder and she crouched beside 
him warily, awaiting his pleasure. 

He fed schnopps to each of the 
women and then broached the mo- 
lasses barrel, the sweebarrel as 
it was known in Valley pidgin. 

He called to those of the women 
who were not yet hopelessly 
drunk and they brought him the 




102 



GALAXY 




smallest and the sickest of the 
children first. He stood back as 
the tots jammed filthy fingers 
into the syrup and rubbed the 
sweetness into their whole faces, 
as if their very pores had taste- 
buds. Good kids. Go ahead, infect 
the syrup and pass it on. Pass it on 
so that the next census shows less 
and the census after shows less 
again. Pass on the barrel with a 
cargo of mumps and measles and 
diptheria and smallpox and all 
the other goodies. Pass it along and 
help nature take her course. 

He laughed, watching the tod- 
dlers taking their turns until they 
were lifted away screaming by 
their reeling mothers. No wonder 
City people had ceased to consider 
the savages any threat. There was 
no spine here, no guts. Just a blind 
groping for more, like kittens 
whose eyes had never opened. 

In a final generous, vicious ges- 
ture he lifted the almost empty 
sweet barrel and pitched it to the 
ground, where the children fought 
and snarled over it like dogs. Tooth 
and nail they fought for the few cal- 
ories that might so easily have been 
theirs if only their fathers 
bothered to keep a few bees. If 
only — if only! Starting from here 
in this Valley these stupid bas- 
tards could still recover. 

He looked around him at the 
drunken Smifs who were fighting, 
dancing, copulating, or simply 
lying on the ground like dead 
sheep. Then he reached into his 



haversack and took out a 
cleaning swab. With it he wiped the 
girl he had chosen, contemptuously 
ripping her few rags from her. The 
cleanser made her shudder but 
she did not resist him. Within a 
minute she was completely clean, 
slightly perfumed and ready for 
him. He dropped the soiled swab 
and took out a concentrated food 
bar from his kit. While she wolfed 
it down he took a pull at his hip 
flask, letting the centuries-old 
cognac give him the added fire he 
needed to soil himself with the 
little savage. Then he led her to the 
mound beside the old power 
shovel, the only grassy plot in the 
whole valley and laid her down. 

A ll the while Smiftu watched 
from his hiding place behind the 
huts. Fear was big inside him, 
making his breath small and his 
heart very loud. He had seen Smifs 
kill an unwanted Smif, had 
helped to do it, so he could expect 
no mercy. And yet something big- 
ger than fear kept him where he 
was, watching. He swallowed and 
he watched. The God made love to 
his women exactly as a Smif 
would have done. It was the first 
Schnoppsday that Smiftu had 
ever been sober and he observed 
with interest what was happen- 
ing. Perhaps the Lord was like a 
Smif in other ways, too. Perhaps 
the Lord would die if a Smif hit 
him in the killing place under the 
ear with the keen edge of his spade. 



SCHNOPPSDAY 



103 




He watched while the children 
squabbled and licked the swee- 
barrel dry. And while the Lord 
Schnopps finished abusing the 
girl and stood up, kicking her 
aside. And then his eye ."illed with 
the horror of it as the Lord turned 
to the Dragon God, who stood high 
and proud on his Mound, and 
opened the front of his garment 
again and soiled the side of the 
Dragon God. 

It was too much for even a here- 
tic like Smiftu to countenance. 
Silently he raced over the packed 
earth, vaulting over the sleepy chil- 
dren, his spade already poised in 
his hand. The Lord heard him and 
turned but his hands were too busy 
to reach for the loudspade he wore 
by his side and before he could 
reach it, Smiftu had sliced his 
throat with the edge of his spade. 
The Lord died as men die. He 
struggled and bled upon the 
ground and he died, choking and 
gurgling. No Smif was awake to 
see him die. Only Smiftu. And as 
the Lord died so did Smiftu’s 
fears. He reached down and took 



the loudspade from the dead 
Lord’s hand. And his eyes turned 
to the Lord’s wagon and the great 
beasts who pulled it. 

Slowly Smiftu went to the wagon 
and looked into it. He found many 
spades in it, two hands’ fingers of 
spades. And he found gingham 
cloth and something that felt like 
hide but was not hide and other 
wonders that he did not under- 
stand. And he found the schnopps 
barrel to be empty. And he 
thought a thought - perhaps the 
barrel could hold water as well as 
schnopps. And perhaps the same 
beasts who drew the wagon with 
schnopps could draw the wagon 
with water. And many walks to the 
well and from the well would be 
saved. A man could sit upon the 
wagon and not work. And a man 
could think. And Smiftu’s puzzled 
mind became for an instant clear- 
er. He would think perhaps of tak- 
ing one side from the Dragon God 
and making a giant spade that the 
beasts could pull. Yes. Smiftu 
would think of many, many things. 
That much he knew. if

GALAXY 




A CLEAR cold wind ripped 
through the early fall evening. 
The wind always blew out of the 
mountains at that time of the year 
in Denver. Robert Brent Holmes 
was used to it. He zipped his wind- 
breaker to the neck as he got into 
his car and drove to the Rocky 
Mountain Arsenal, where he was 
officially listed as a Custodial 
Engineer — a government eu- 
phemism for janitor. 

At thirty-seven, married and 
with three daughters. Holmes was 
an average sort of man — perhaps 
a little heavier than he needed to 
be, perhaps not as bright as he 
would have wanted — and perhaps 
a little disappointed that he was 
a janitor and nothing more. But 
he had liked working at the ar- 
senal because he had felt it was a 
job with a great deal of security 
and more fringe benefits than 
most janitorial jobs offered and 
because the pay, although low, 
was better than the average jani- 
tor received. 

He had been working at the ar- 
senal for three years, and had 
expected to continue working 
there until something better came 
along. His wife had objected to his 
working the night shift — but in a 
year or two, if all had gone well, 
he would probably have been get- 
ting his choice of shifts. 

But the arsenal had just com- 
pleted its task of detoxifying var- 
ious nerve gases which had been 
stored there. The job had taken 



longer than had been expected but 
it was finished at last. So the talk 
was that the arsenal would be shut 
down and the thirty-five hundred 
employees either transferred or 
laid off. Robert Brent Holmes’ job 
was one that would be done away 
with outright and he was now ner- 
vously awaiting a dismissal order. 

“Nobody ever cares what hap- 
pens to people like us,” his wife 
had said before he left for his shift. 
“We can all starve as far as they’re 
concerned.” 

“Well, they’re talking about 
keeping the arsenal open to destroy 
bacteriological weapons,” Holmes 
told her. “We’ll just have to hope 
that’s what they do.” 

There were several custodial en- 
gineers at the arsenal and Holmes 
was hardly noticed as he showed 
his I. D. card and drove through 
the gate. As a matter of fact, he 
was hardly noticed anywhere at 
any time. 

Before he had learned of the 
threatened closing of the facility 
Holmes had never paid much at- 
tention to what went on there. But 
with the imminent possibility of 
losing his job, he became interest- 
ed in everything about it. He be- 
gan to read every newspaper story, 
every report in the magazines and 
he listened to every radio news 
story about the Rocky Mountain 
Arsenal. 

A battle was raging between the 
politicians of Denver and the Pen- 
tagon, which was in charge of the 



106 



GALAXY 




facility. The loss of thirty-five hun- 
dred jobs was no laughing matter 
to Denver and the local leaders 
fought hard to retain the large em- 
ployer. 

Following the signing of the In- 
ternational Peace Pact in early 
1973, all the nations of the world 
were in the process of destroying 
all but the internally necessary 
defensive weapons in their arse- 
nals. Robert Holmes laughed to 
think that the peace which had 
eluded the world from the begin- 
ning of mankind was now ap- 
proaching reality - and was likely 
to deprive him of his livelihood. 
It was a bitter laugh at best. 

Somehow the local politicians 
got through to the Pentagon. Co- 
incidentally, the military leaders of 
the nation were at a loss to find a 
place, fully equipped, without any 
other function, at which the stock 
of a bacteriological warfare strain 
could be destroyed. Lot 22A, a 
particularly virulent strain, was at 
the time being stored where it had 
been grown, at the Maryland 
Chemical and Biological Research 
and Development Center. 

L ot 22A was a problem. It pro- 
duced a blood disease in ani- 
mals that was invariably fatal. Sci- 
entists could find no antidote for 
the disease. The fifteen hundred 
different cultures of Lot 22A were 
extremely unstable and expensive 
to store, requiring constant refrig- 
eration in order to keep the strain 



sporulated and non-reproductive. 
Having failed to find an antidote, 
the scientists got to work on a 
means of prophylaxis against the 
strain. Their quest in this direction 
went unrewarded. Lot 22A there- 
fore was useless as a weapon, since 
no protection for friendly popula- 
tions was available. The military 
had declared the whole lot “obso- 
lete,” and recommended that it be 
destroyed immediately. 

When the International Peace 
Pact had been ratified Lot 22A be- 
came an example to prove that the 
United States was indeed de- 
stroying its offensive weapons. 
At about this time, the Rocky 
Mountain Arsenal finished its 
detoxification function, and the 
debate about what to do with the 
facility had reached the execu- 
tive mansion in Washington. 

Senator Longdon of Vermont 
made a strongly worded speech 
against all germ warfare weap- 
ons, and particularly against the 
storage of such weapons. The 
President, cognizant of the polit- 
ical bombshell which would be 
made of continued storage of bio- 
logical weapons especially Lot 
22A - saw an opportunity to kill 
two birds with one stone. Calling 
the congressional delegation 
from Colorado into the Oval 
Room of the White House, he held 
a press conference at which he told 
the world the United States would 
begin destroying stocks of bio- 
logical weapons immediately.

and that the Rocky Mountain Ar- 
senal would be converted for that 
use, at minimum cost, enabling 
the Denver area to maintain the 
thirty-five hundred jobs at the 
arsenal. 

A few voices were raised in pro- 
test, some claiming that the rest of 
the world powers could not be 
trusted, and that the U. S. would 
be left without a powerful enough 
deterrent. Others claimed it was 
unsafe to destroy these weapons 
near so large a population area. 

Robert Brent Holmes was happy 
when the new role of the arsenal 
was announced to his shift that 
early fall night. Knowing that he 
would have his Job for some time to 
come he went about his work, 
feeling free once more to plan his 
personal life during the winter 
months ahead. 

In the morning, when he reached 
home, he played with his old shep- 
herd dog with greater gusto than 
usual, hugged and kissed each of 
his girls and happily told his wife 
about the arsenal’s new lease on 
life. 

“This Senator Longdon from 
Vermont,” his wife said, referring 
to a newspaper story, “doesn’t 
think it’s such a good idea to bring 
all those germs here.” 

“What does he know?” Holmes 
answered. “He doesn’t have to 
worry about his job. I think it’s a 
great idea.” 

The shipments of Lot 22A began 
to arrive at the arsenal the 



following week. Holmes smiled as 
he saw the bright red, refriger- 
ated, aluminum packing cases. 
With his job assured, he thought 
of takiftg the children sledding in 
the mountains when the snows 
came, of short drives in the foot- 
hills in the spring, new clothes for 
his wife and all the other things a 
man can enjoy when he is on regu- 
lar wages. 

Holmes, one night, was at his 
duties in the corridor in front of 
the hermetically sealed laboratory. 
He had swept the floor and had be- 
gun to mop it when the setup crew 
started to bring in Lot 22A and 
unload the cases in the laboratory. 
Homes cursed under his breath as 
the men tracked up his freshly 
mopped floor, not even noticing 
him or the clean tile. He mumbled 
as the laboratory was depressur- 
ized with a hiss, the seal was bro- 
ken and the men went inside, 
guided by the chief microbiolo- 
gist. Handtruck tracks and foot- 
prints continued to slop up the 
clean floor and finally Holmes de- 
cided to wait until the men were 
finished before he continued to 
mop the corridor. 

H e watched as the individu- 
al vials of culture were careful- 
ly removed from refrigerated 
packing cases, and each vial was 
placed in the refrigeration unit, in 
special racks. The unit was open 
on one side to expose the vials to 
ultraviolet radiation. The bacteria 
would be irradiated for twenty- 



108 



GALAXY 




four hours before being dumped 
into a bariumoxide bath for final 
destruction. 

Scientists who had worked with 
l.ot 22A in Maryland had noted a 
peculiar property of the strain. 
Although exposure to ultra-violet 
for twenty-four hours immo- 
bilized most of the bacteria and 
rendered them permanently in- 
capable of reproduction, a tenth 
of a percent of each culture was 
likely to mutate as a result of 
such exposure. The mutant 
strain, rather than being sterilized 
or otherwise weakened by irradi- 
ation, became active, more viru- 
lent than ever and, the bacteri- 
ologists surmised, if not de- 
stroyed by barium oxidation im- 
mediately, capable of repro- 
ducing at seven to ten times the 
normal rate. Further, this mutant 
produced the same disease as the 
rest of Lot 22A, but the disease 
occurred so gradually in animal 
life that death took three to four 
weeks under most conditions, 
rather than the one to two weeks 
expected with the normal strain. 

For a period of ninety seconds 
after birth the mutant was partic- 
ularly dangerous. Exposed to 
warmth and ultraviolet under 
proper conditions, the mutant 
multiplied wildly — provided it met 
a saline and yet somewhat alkaline 
environment and fibrous, hairlike 
material upon which to string out 
during this period. Under these 
conditions the mutant strain was 



virtually indestructable. After the 
ninety-second gestation period the 
new strain reproduced geometric- 
ally, becoming air borne and even- 
tually capable of killing all ani- 
mal life on the planet. Since these 
conditions were not likely to be 
met in the laboratory, contain- 
ment and destruction were con- 
sidered to be well within safe 
limits. 

Holmes continued to watch the 
setup men half-heartedly, wishing 
they would finish and get out of the 
corridor so he could complete his 
work there and move on. He was 
dropping behind schedule and 
would not have the time for a full 
lunch hour. 

When the men finally finished 
and left they walked past Holmes 
as though he weren't there. He was 
used to being an invisible man. 
All the janitors were nonexistent 
to the higher echelons. However, 
Holmes didn’t care. As long as he 
got his full pay on time, his regu- 
lar fringe benefits and was left in 
peace to do this work, he didn't 
care if all the people in the arse- 
nal made believe he wasn’t there. 

Let them be snobs — / don’t need 
them. 

With the men gone and the lab- 
oratory once more pressurized 
and sealed. Holmes finished mop- 
ping the corridor, stopping once 
or twice for a breather and to look 
at the vials standing in their racks. 
He shook his head and made extra 
sure the floor near the three high- 



LOT22A 



109 




impact, plexi-styrene inset oper- 
ation booths was clean. He glanced 
at the rubber gloves fastened under 
the viewplates in the booths inside 
the laboratory, waiting for the 
scientists to come and bring them 
to life in the slow, animated move- 
ments necessary safely to move 
the vials. 

After he had finished mopping 
the corridor, he looked at his 
watch. It was late — well past the 
start of his normal lunch hour and 
too late to eat in the cafeteria. He 
took his lunch bucket from the 
cleanup cart, backed against the 
wall opposite the inset booths, 
and slid his backside to the floor. 
He opened the lunch bucket and 
took out the first of two sandwich- 
es, smiling as he unwrapped it, and 
realized that it was tuna fish— his 
favorite. He began to eat with 
gusto, pausing to hum bawdy bal- 
lads between bites . 

O UT of the corner of his eye. 
Holmes saw a bright flash of 
light. He looked up, but nothing 
was out of order and he went back 
to his sandwich. Another flash. 
This time he stood up and walked 
over to an inset booth. Light was 
flashing intermittently from a 
portion of the wall that could not 
be seen from outside the lab. 
Holmes gulped down the last of his 
sandwich and went into the inset 
booth. He still couldn’t see the 
source of the flashes of light but he 
was almost certain something 



was wrong. He stuck his hands in- 
to the rubber gloves fastened to 
the booth and pulled his body 
closer to the viewplate. He could 
barely see the sparks jumping 
from a circuit-breaker in the wall, 
not two feet away from him, but 
within the lab. Then there was 
another flash, brighter than be- 
fore, and Holmes thought he heard 
a crackling sound. He felt ex- 
treme heat on his right hand, 
through the glove. He glanced up 
at the vials of cultures. They were 
vibrating a little, the one closest 
to his right hand was tilted pre- 
cariously. Holmes reached in and 
straightened it in its rack. Then he 
withdrew from the booth and 
walked to the fire alarm box. As he 
raised his hand to break the glass 
and sound the alarm, he noticed a 
fleck of his sandwich on his index 
finger, and unconsciously licked 
it off. Then he struck the little 
brass hammer against the glass, 
pulled the lever and sounded the 
fire alarm. He went back to his 
lunch bucket and packed every- 
thing to get it out of the way. 

The fire crew arrived instantly. 
They depressurized the lab, broke 
the seal and went in to put out the 
fire. The microbiologist was on 
the scene a moment later to 
inspect the damage. 

Holmes figured he’d have to 
mop the floor of the corridor 
again. He left, going to the next 
unit, intending to come back to 
the scene of the fire and clean up 



110 



GALAXY 




after the men finally were gone. 

“Doesn’t seem to be any damage 
to the Lot,” the microbiologist 
said into a walkie-talkie. “The heat 
of the fire could have dried and 
cracked the rubber gloves in booth 
A — better replace the gloves im- 
mediately. The refrigeration unit 
was out for a second or so until 
the emergency power switched on. 
The men are completing circuit 
box rewiring now. All vials seem 
undamaged — still cold.” He 
didn’t notice the hairline crack at 
the top of the vial Holmes had 
straightened. “Some of them are 
standing at peculiar angles. Must 
have been vibration from a slight 
explosion. No visible damage, 
though.” 

R obert holmes finished 

the corridor in front of Lot 
22A just before his shift was over. 
He zipped up against the chill air 
as he left the arsenal. Orange- 
gray slants of light were begin- 
ning to show in the black, predawn 
sky as he headed home. He was 
looking forward to some peace 
and quiet. He parked the car in 
front of his gate, walked into the 
front yard and was immediately 
pounced upon by his old dog. He 
petted the animal. He was as 
happy to see the dog as it was to 
see him. The shepherd licked his 
master’s hands and some of the al- 
ready activated mutant bacteria 
began a new colony in the ani- 
mal’s mouth. The strain was al- 



ready beginning to multiply geo- 
metrically, having been brought to 
full and active life by the saline 
and alkaline saliva of Holmes’s 
mouth. 

A new day was dawning. Robert 
Holmes walked into his house as 
he always did, perhaps a little 
happier than usual. He kissed his 
wife with genuine warmth instead 
of giving her the habitual peck on 
the cheek. She smiled at him, took 
his windbreaker and motioned 
him to breakfast. The children 
were just getting to the table; their 
hot cereal was steaming— waiting 
for them. Holmes kissed each of 
his daughters in descending order 
from the eldest. 

An old dog, almost blind, the 
shepherd had few pleasures in life. 
The greatest was to greet his mas- 
ter when he came home from work. 
Next came the joy of rolling in the 
yard with the two youngest girls. 
But, for pure fun, there was noth- 
ing to surpass his games with the 
large black and white tomcat from 
next door. At least twice each 
day — in the early morning, just be- 
fore the cat was allowed into the 
house, and again in the evening 
when he went out — the cat jumped 
the fence to play with the shep- 
herd. This day was no exception. 
The dog was happy to see the 
blurred image of the cat coming to- 
ward him. 

They wrestled, as animals do, 
just playing, of course, the dog 
taking the cat’s head into his 



LOT 22A 



m 




mouth, careful not to hurt his 
friend. Then the cat broke away 
and the dog chased him, faking 
menacing growls all the way. 
When the cat was caught, it was his 
turn to chase, and the shepherd 
ran, the cat hissing close on his tail. 
When the cat’s master came out to 
go to work the game was broken 
off immediately. The cat liked to 
rub against his master’s legs, wait- 
ing to be picked up and stroked. 
The old tom heard a door close 
and jumped back into his own 
yard, tail erect, running to his 
master’s legs. 

Ricardo Montoya lifted his cat 
and allowed the animal to nip his 
hand gently. Then he got into his 
car for the short drive to Stapleton 
International Airport, where he 
prepared food for inflight meals. 
He had a busy day ahead. The first 
flight on his shift was headed for 
Los Angeles with connections to 
the Orient. The second flight went 
to New York with connections for 
Europe. Montoya was proud of his 
part in the vast transportation sys- 
tem that crossed through Denver. 

T he mutant strain of Lot 22A 
was multiplying madly by the 
time Montoya’s cat infected him. 
The bacteria no longer needed any 
saliva to speed reproduction. If 
bacteria had a paradise, these 
mutants were enjoying theirs. 
They had increased to a popula- 
tion many million times their ori- 
ginal number. They were air-borne 



and spreading and conditions were 
favorable for even more rapid re- 
production and infection. 

When Robert Holmes’s dog 
died, eighteen days later, the family 
was sad but not surprised. The dog 
was old, winter was coming and 
the animal had seemed very tired 
and weak for a number of days be- 
fore. They didn’t take the dog to a 
veterinarian because they couldn’t 
afford that kind of luxury. Besides, 
they knew the dog’s days were 
numbered. 

The entire Holmes family was 
feeling under the weather by this 
time. Holmes himself felt tired and 
without energy all the time. His 
whole body ached, not badly, but 
enough to be uncomfortable. They 
all had diarrhea. Of course, it was 
the beginning of the flu season and 
they went through something like 
this every year. None of them 
thought much about it. 

Ricardo Montoya and his family 
seemed to have the flu bug also. 
Something was going around. 
Others in the city were com- 
plaining of aches and pains, fatigue 
and various other symptoms. Dur- 
ing flu season such discomforts 
were common and nobody took 
alarm. 

At the arsenal work proceeded 
on schedule. Lot 22A was being de- 
stroyed. The scientists were al- 
ready looking forward to the next 
lot of biological weaponry to 
be disposed of at the arsenal. 
Hardly anyone at the place re-

membered the small electrical 
fire of almost three weeks ago. Be- 
sides, they had their own prob- 
lems. Everyone in the Denver 
area seemed to have, to greater or 
lesser degree, some form of influ- 
enza. It was discouraging, many 
of the scientists thought. 

Here we are able to create and 
destroy complicated bacteriologi- 



cal forms, and we still can't do 
away with influenza or the com- 
mon cold. 

On the morning of the twenty- 
third day after the fire Robert 
Holmes felt terrible. He took 
some aspirin and and went to 
sleep. The children were already 
in bed with the flu and Mrs. 
Holmes was barely able to get

"My very first novel, all about a 
still-to-come space race," says Ben 
Bova, "was rejected back in 1950. The 
publisher was afraid Senator Joseph 
McCarthy would take exception to an 
American suggesting the Russians 
might be ahead of us in anything. It 
was a more innocent world then." 

Seven years later, when Sputnik 
and the space race were launched, 
Ben was a technical editor on Project 
Vanguard, which was supposed to 
produce man's first artificial satel- 
lite. At the time, Ben admits, there 
were strong indications that the Rus- 
sians would do it. "But," he says, "we 
were nonetheless shocked when Sput- 
nik actually went up." Every year the 
AIAA gives the Robert Goddard 
Award to the man who has done the 
most for American astronautics. "At 
some point," Ben muses, "Nikita 
Khrushchev, the man who really got 
us to the moon, should have been the 
recipient." 



Ben discovered sf with the first is- 
sue of Superman comics. He was in- 
trigued by the picture of the hero 
leaving the exploding planet Krypton. 
From there, Ben's reading in thefield 
followed a more or less traditional 
path from Burroughs to Heinlein to 
Bradbury... After writing and sub- 
mitting a few unsuccessful stories, 
Ben sold his first novel. The Star Con- 
querors, ten years ago. The book was 
the first of many successful science- 
fiction juveniles, and he has written 
as many science-fiction and science- 
fact books for the general reader. 

Ben, his wife Rosa, and their two 
children, Michael and Regina, live in 
a suburb of Boston, where he is the 
Manager of Marketing for Avco Ev- 
erett Research Laboratories. Part of 
his job is to find customers who are 
willing to make sf stories come true, 
like building high-powered lasers and 
developing artificial hearts and find-

around the house. That evening 
Holmes felt so weak that he asked 
his wife to call the arsenal and tell 
them he would not be in -that he 
was too ill to work. It was the first 
time he had stayed home sick since 
he had started working at Rocky 
Mountain Arsenal. 

Mrs. Holmes couldn’t get a line 
into the arsenal. The telephones 
were busy and remained busy all 
night. By the time Mrs. Holmes 
went to sleep, her husband was in 
a coma. She didn’t notice it, 
though. She was so tired, she fell 
off to sleep as soon as she hit the 
bed. 

The children died quietly during 
the night. Robert Brent Holmes 
passed away around midnight. 
Mrs. Holmes was the last to go, 
sometime between two and three 
in the morning. There was no one 
to find the bodies. Even if there had 
been someone, there was nothing 
anybody could have done. Lot 
22A (mutant) was already in full 
control of the world’s destiny. 

The first call came to the bacteri- 
ologists at the arsenal about 
midday of the twenty-third day af- 
ter the electrical fire. A skeleton 
staff was manning the massive 
facility -absenteeism being very 
high. The call was from a Denver 
pathologist who had done an au- 
topsy on an old lady. The doctor 
claimed there was something pe- 
culiar about the blood slides from 
the old woman. He made an ap- 
pointment with the bacteriologist 



to look at the slides the next day. 
The appointment was never kept. 
Both the pathologist and the bac- 
teriologist were found dead by 
morning. 

The spread of the disease was 
unbelievably rapid. Deaths were 
so common and frequent in many 
countries that corpses were 
stacked up in the streets. Govern- 
ments were unable to function. 
Industry ground to a halt. The in- 
dustrialized nations were hit the 
hardest and the soonest. The 
mutant bacterial strain dis- 
tributed itself through the air cur- 
rents. Soon the animal food 
sources on the planet disap- 
peared. By then it didn’t matter. 
There were not tnany people or 
other animals around to eat the 
food animals. 



A CLEAR, cold, wet wind 
brought the first snow of the 
season to the Rocky Mountains 
and to Denver. The wind whipped 
the snow into small drifts in the 
city. Whirlwinds of snow spun 
through the quiet streets. The auto- 
matic, thermostatically control- 
led heating units in the buildings in- 
creased their output. The only 
sounds inside buildings were the 
hums and clicks of automatic ma- 
chinery. Outside, only the wind 
made noise. The snow fell on the 
city, clean and white. It settled on 
the ground waiting for footsteps to 
crush it into slush. ★

I T’S a rainy day where I'm writ- 
ing this, three months before 
you see it. The kind of day on 
which a writer does the first four 
pages of a manuscript based on 
nothing more than a pervasive 
mood and a chance opening sen- 
tence. If he’s lucky, he’ll eventual- 
ly figure out where the story’s go- 
ing and finish it. More than like- 
ly, he’ll throw those four pages 
away, with his subconscious 
keeping a word or two for use 
when it’s relevant. If he does fin- 
ish it, out of a sense of economy, 
he’ll probably have to force the is- 
sue; what began as a moody out- 
burst will be extruded into a 
“story” through one of the stan- 
dard plot templates. He’ll collect 
his few cents a word with an inner 
feeling of ordinariness. The next 
time the weather and he are like 



this, he’ll say to himself: “Anoth- 
er one of those useless rainy 
days.” 

Writers write lots of things that 
aren’t “stories.” The concept of 
“story” is essentially an inven- 
tion of the audience. By the na- 
ture of things, the audience is pre- 
vented from reacting to anything 
but the structure of a given 
column of arranged alphabetical 
symbols. 

It can't know what an arrange- 
ment of w'ords meant to the writer. 
It can’t finally extract a meaning 
until it receives a positive indi- 
cation of realized purpose. That 
is, a plot-turn. But a writer speaks 
first to himself. He selects words 
and reactions in response to his 
intimate internal structure. A 
writer can tell himself a “story” 
with one sentence with a word. 



115 




or sometimes less. Only after- 
ward does he face the chore of ex- 
pressing something like that same 
reaction to a group of strangers. 

If w'riters didn’t have to publish, 
they wouldn't have many writing 
problems. Writers write to them- 
selves automatically; little inter- 
nal greeting cards and get-well 
messages; bulletins on the state of 
the environment; dunning let- 
ters; checks drawn on the bank of 
psychic satisfaction; diplomas; 
notices of termination of service. 

A writer is his own foster pa- 
rent. He took over the assignment 
of raising himself on some early 
day when he noticed irrevocably 
that the world didn't have things 
quite right; that you might love 
others but you couldn’t trust them 
to do a good job. 

Writers are happiest when they 
don’t have to publish. Translating 
for strangers wastes time, ob- 
scures important points, and in- 
terferes with what should be an 
uninterrupted lifelong flow of 
communication. The happiest, 
most grown-up writers are the 
ones who find some non-con- 
flicting means of earning a living. 
Of course, they don’t get any 
stories out. 

A commercial writer a science 
fiction writer, say has a choice. 
He can writhe on his dilemma. Or 
he has the choice of not giving a 
damn; of divorcing what he pub- 
lishes from what he writes to him- 
self. 



The mind being infinitely ingen- 
ious in protecting its immediate 
comfort at all future costs, the di- 
vorced writer can maintain his 
position in the eyes of the audi- 
ence by ceasing to take responsi- 
bility for communicating to his 
ward — by leaving his personality 
in perpetual adolescence in ex- 
change for his body’s living. He is 
now free to devote himself as a 
“writer” solely to extracting 
reactions from audiences. Of 
eourse, he is no longer in a posi- 
tion to judge the validity of what he 
“writes.” 

He develops an apparently ego- 
centric exterior personality, 
forcing himself on the individu- 
als around him with the word-ex- 
ercises of the quipster, party 
raconteur, amusing drunk, or of 
the abrasive gadfly, compulsive 
lecturer, agitator, Don Juan, or 
ugly drunk. This is because words 
and actions have become mere 
appurtenances to the only mes- 
sage he has left, sent outward in 
the only direction he has: 
“How’m 1 doing?” 

Of course, if you don’t know the 
answer to that one. Buddy, at ev- 
ery given moment, you’re in trou- 
ble that won’t be handled this side 
of the grave. But you are a “writ- 
er.” No one around you can doubt 
it. 

The mind being infinitely in- 
genious, there’s another way, 
which is to create a strict separa- 
tion between what you are and 



116 



GALAXY 




what you do. The internal writ- 
ing goes on; the public “writing” 
is something Mr. Hyde does. Es- 
sentially, this is an altitude of 
total contempt for the audience. 

Either way - 1 doubt if there are 
significant other choices for 

him the divorced writer is no 

longer in a position to judge the 
validity of what he “writes." 

I T’S the nature of commercial 
writing science fiction, say to 
force writers toward divorce from 
themselves. The pressure is not to 
waste a word or an idea. You can 
see it in the way so many writers 
forward every feeble notion as an 
“idea” or expound at length on 
some incidental detail because it 
represents the only flash of true 
invention in an otherwise rou- 
tine construction. The happy 
ones in this brood are those too 
young or too oblivious to perceive 
the nature of the process. 

(Writers come in all grades ol' in- 
telligence; communication is 
not a measure of wit. One of the 
most “perceptive” writers in this 
business is a silly, stupid man by 
any measure of his ability to rea- 
son consistently or to function 
in this world. So are any number 
of nonwriter people, of course. 
That’s my point in this instance: 
writers are human. They are vul- 
nerable. At least, I hope so, be- 
cause that’s my excuse, too.) 

Under pressure economic pres- 
sure, ego pressure, or whatever 



comes in this regard — a human 
writer cannot help but begin to 
exhibit the behavior of a trapped 
rat. If he is to maintain his 
editorial contacts, to keep his 
name before the audience, not 
break the flow of checks, to pro- 
gress unfalteringly toward the 
day of boxed sets, mass reissues 
and the lecture circuit, there must 
be limes when he must perform 
out of tune with what goes on in- 
side him. Repeated often enough, 
the offense to his vital parts is 
great enough so that the trouble- 
some vital must be isolated; he ig- 
nores it and waits for gangrene, or 
he eats it off, and experiences im- 
mediate relief. 

The audience demand is for con- 
sistent excellence, of course. And 
why not? The implied contract 
states that the audience will get 
delivery of what it pays for, with 
the asking price for promised ex- 
cellence set by the publisher. 

For the audience, the publisher 
is indistinguishable from the 
writer. It doesn’t buy a manu- 
script; it buys a story, printed in a 
package with illustrations and 
the rub-off from the total gestalt 
of features, associated stories, 
typography, the memory of past 
issues and the featured promise 
of future publications. Even 
when the audience sits at the eve- 
ning fire and listens to the bard, it 
buys his gestures, his voice, his 
manner of dress and the camel on 
which he rides. Day after day, vil-

And why should anyone care 
about his need to resolve his prob- 
lems with his unsuitable wife, or 
his reckless child, or the frequent 
pain in his left arm? Yet he would 
love to tell you about them — if it 
were possible to do so without 
first conferring them upon some 
hero with different clothes and a 
better camel... that is, upon 
someone for whom these attri- 
butes cannot be ultimately true, 
for he differs from the man who 
speaks of them? 

There are many dangerous pro- 
fessions. And many of them call 
not only for a disregard to per- 
sonal safety but for a simul- 
taneous exercise of complex and 
educated skill. The commercial 
arts, however, are uniformly 
dangerous even to the man sit- 
ting still in his chair. They can 
leave the body able to move and 
speak while macerating the per- 
sonality; there is no topectomy as 



successful as the one the surgeon 
directs for himself. In most cases, 
coldly considered, there is no ap- 
preciable loss to the world. But the 
remorseless process spares 
neither small nor great. There’s 
such a little time in which the com- 
mercial artist functions in joy. 
Yet next month’s issue comes out 
forever. 

We speak of it casually — the 
writer’s block, the eventual burn- 
out, the descent into (compara- 
tively) affluent mediocrity, the 
Styrofoam packing of established 
reputation and rigid, acceptable 
public persona. We’ve seen it hap- 
pen to them all; it’s an accepted 
phenomenon. Nine-tenths of the 
anthologies that cross my desk are 
crypts jammed full of funerary 
urns, twined over with encomiums. 
Half the novels are headstones. 

It’s a rainy day. Next month I’ll

“Hello,” he said. “Hello — 
Walter, why don’t you answer?” 
“Oh, how nice of you to call,” 
the voice said. “It was awfully nice 
of you to call.” 

“Who is this?” he demanded. 
“Who are you?” 

“Yes, yes, happy New Year to 
you, Michael. Yes, it has been a 
nice year.” 

“What kind of nonsense is 
this?” he snapped. 

“A good year. Yes, a very good 
year — the best since I’ve retired. I 
went to the class reunion in Denver 
last month, just before Christ- 
mas.” 

“Is this some kind of joke?” he 
said. “New Year? Christmas last 
month? It’s the middle of sum- 
mer.” 

“Hello. Yes, yes, happy New 
Year, dear. Happy nineteen-sixty- 
three.” 

“Shut up, damn you. What kind 
of trick are you pulling. It’s nine- 
teen-seventy. It’s mid-August and 
hot as hell and if you don’t — ” 
“That’s sweet of you, awfully 
sweet of you. Thank you, thank 
you.” 



“Hello,” he shouted, losing all 
patience. “Hello, hello, hello, hel- 
lo, damn it, hello — ” 

“Good night. Merry Christmas 
— thank you, good night.” 

“Stop it,” he yelled. “Don’t go 
away. Don’t try that — ” 

“When you hear the tone, the 
time will be — ” 

“Hello, hello,” he shouted. 

Click . 

”... the time will be exactly — ” 
He slammed the phone into its 
cradle and stood, shaking, his eyes 
misty with sweat. The pulse in his 
neck throbbed with anger. Cold 
played across the liver-spotted tis- 
sue of his scalp, rousing the few 
remaining wisps of crepe hair that 
grew there. 

Damn pranksters, he raged. 
Who the hell did they think they 
were trying to kid? He stopped, 
wondering who would want to try 
such a banal trick. 

His nephew’s boy? The one with 
the yellowed teeth, white-flecked 
mouth opening in the start of a 
braying laugh? 

Or Schulz of Carpenter or Wil- 
kenson? He snorted at the thought. 
Ineffectual weaklings. The thought 
of one of them getting the better of 
him after all these years . They 
still remembered their hatred of 
him, though, even at well past 
eighty when all hatred and lust and 
sorrow should be dead. Or the vul- 
tures downstairs — the endless rela- 
tives, whispering. How is he today? 
That's good, that's very good.

Meaning, If he dies it will be just 
great because of all that money 
and he’s too old to need it or care 
about what life can bring . 

Alone, embattled. His withered 
lips twisted in contempt. He had 
built, had cut throats and wrecked 
better than them in the process. 
Let them go out and grub for it 
the way he had done with no one to 
help. Not even his wife, the pretty 
tinsel thing he had bought after no 
one else would touch him. 

H e sat for a long moment, 
looking at the phone. Then, 
gently, he lifted it from its cradle 
and, after consulting his phone in- 
dex (there had been a time when his 
memory was sharp and unfailing) 
he carefully dialed his brother’s 
number again. 

Click . click . click . 

“ . hear the tone, the time will 
be exactly—” 

“No,” he said and stabbed at the 
cradle button with his finger. He 
dialed the number once again. 

Click . 

“When you hear the tone — ” 

His hand darted forward. 

“Wait, don’t hang up. Who are 
you?” 

He pressed the phone tightly to 
his ear, his breath hissing in the 
perforations of the mouthpiece. 

“I said, who are you? I can hear 
you breathing — ” 

“Hello, hello, why are you both- 
ering me? It’s two o’clock in the 
morning,” the voice said. 



“Liar,” he said. “It’s six in the 
afternoon, daylight saving time, in 
the middle of August and the sun 
is so bright you can look at the as- 
phalt without glasses and you — ” 
“No, don’t shout, Jimmy. It 
doesn’t do to get excited — ” 

“My name is not Jimmy,” he 
said, trying to control his voice. 

“No, it’s Board policy and if 
they want me to retire — ” 

The same voice, he realized. Fe- 
male — probably middle-aged. A 
very pleasant voice, he thought, 
and then shook off the thought 
with annoyance. There wasn’t any 
point in thinking that way at his 
age. 

“Hello, who are you?” 

“1 know, just to June... Well, 
it’s been a year . Ever since the 
end of the war, ever since you 
came back from Korea.” 

“The war?” he shouted. “The 
Korean war? Damn, the war’s 
ended over seventeen years ago. 
Nineteen-fifty-three to nineteen- 
seventy is seventeen years. Can’t 
you count?” 

“Thank you, thank you,” the 
voice said. Middle-aged, but with 
young overtones. Whom did he 
know who sounded like that? 
Someone, someone, someone — 
who? 

“Wait,” he pleaded. “Don’t go.” 
“ . the time will be exactly six 
fourteen, daylight sav — ” 

Click . 

“Damn,” he said, his voice shrill 
and cracking. His eyes filled with 



WHEN YOU HEAR THE TONE

tears. Ridiculous. He hadn’t cried 
in twenty years, not since his wife 
had died, and then for pure for- 
mality. He would have cried at the 
death of a favorite hunting dog or 
of a stranger into whose cortege he 
had blundered. Tears were easy 
then because you had strength and 
were unassailable. 

He was too old for crying. 
Eighty-two, and only the vague 
warmth of life still animating him 
with the memory of endless dead 
years when life might have had 
some meaning, had he sought for 
it. Now there was only the leaden 
silence of his room secreted among 
many rooms, with whispering ser- 
vants moving like phantoms 
through the dusk and beefy young 
nephews and glassy-eyed nieces 
waiting for his last gasp, their 
thoughts clawing over bonds and 
cash and other empty symbols of 
eighty-two years. 

How terrible, he thought. How 
terrible, how terrible, how terri- 
ble .. 

Terrible? What was terrible? 

Growing old. Withering and 
cracking like ancient celluloid 
movie film. The images on it bro- 
ken and dusty. Thrown on a fire, 
curling and shriveling an instant 
before extinction and then gone 
with a single puff of sooty flame. 

But age was not that dramatic — 
not even that significant. He would 
simply run down, cease to move, 
become quiescent and the dark 
men who hovered at hand would 



come and do secret things with his 
body so that his face became a 
mask of wax and talc and scented 
rouge and his body shrank in with- 
ered majesty secretly within the 
shroud. 

And the young ones, drunk with 
the negotiable fragments of his 
life, would scarcely remember that 
he had been. 

“Oh, no,” he said softly. “Oh, 
no, no, no, no, no, there is some- 
body. There is somebody. Or there 
was somebody. There must have 
been somebody.” 

B ut he could not think of one — 
not even his brother Walter 
whom he had fed and clothed and 
looked after and whose sprawling, 
middle-aged brood hovered on the 
edge of his existence like circling 
condors. Walter did not even an- 
swer his phone. 

If he could have had someone, 
somewhere. If in the midst of all 
his life he had found someone who 
cared and worried and cheered and 
wept. But he had not and now not 
even the possibility existed that . 

He paused. The possibility? 
Vaguely, dimly, the possibility. 
Only it was late and life had a way 
of losing detail in the amorphous 
mass of years that spilled out and 
vanished, leaving your body older 
and more tired and wrinkled and 
crackling and your mind vague and 
many chambered and without co- 
hesive form. 

Walter, he thought. He had been

trying to talk to Walter, who was 
his one link with life, the only per- 
son of his blood remaining. (For- 
get those creatures downstairs who 
had been generated out of some 
ferment that was not a part of 
him.) 

His fingers, stiff with pain and 
calcification, dialed the number 
and he waited, hearing the burr of 
the bell at the other end. 

“When you hear the tone — ” 

“Damn,” he shouted. “Damn, 
damn, damn — ” 

Click . 

Again, carefully, patiently, not- 
ing each digit, with deliberate pre- 
cision, all seven carefully dialed 
digits. 

At the^sixth digit the sound of 
ringing . not the soft burr but a 
shriller sound, tinny as though the 
signal were in a hollow metal-lined 
room. 

“Hello, hello,” the voice said. 

“Hello,” he said. “Who — ” 

“Oh, it’s you, I wanted so much 
for it to be you again,” the wom- 
an’s voice said. 

“Yes, it’s me. It’s me,” he said 
savagely. “It’s me, Mark Fleiker 
and who the hell are you?” 

“Yes, I know it’s you, Mark. 
How could I forget the voice?” 

“Forget what voice?” he de- 
manded. 

“After all these years, how 
could I forget the voice?” 

“I’ve never talked with you be- 
fore,” he shouted into the mouth- 
piece. 



“All those times,’’ she whis- 
pered. “So few without ever seeing 
you or touching you and knowing 
that you were somewhere out 
there. I wondered where you were 
during the war — ” 

“Woman,” he said plaintively. 
“Woman, what kind of a joke are 
you playing on an old man?” 

“Old?” she said. “Are you really 
old?” 

“I’m old, old, old,” he said. “I 
sit here in this pile of a house and 
watch the jackals gather to fight 
over my bones.” 

“It’s the war,” she said. “This 
horrible war. Everyone seems tak- 
en up in a kind of hysteria. The 
horrible bloodiness — ” 

“I hate the thought of the war,” 
he said. “It is an idiot war. There 
is no end to it and only the blood 
and the killing and the waste for 
what reason — It never was our 
war — 

“No,” she said soothingly. 
“You must have lost someone 
very dear, but it is our war. It is 
our war even though its nearly 
over.” 

“It’ll never be over,” he said. 

“Only a matter of days,” she 
said “and then we can breathe in 
peace and be truly free of all the 
dreadfulness. They’ve crossed the 
Rhine and — 

“Crossed the Rhine?” he 
shouted. “Are you mad?” 

“ — only a matter of time — ” the 
voice said, its quality suddenly tin- 
ny. 



WHEN YOU HEAR THE TONE 



123 




“What’s crossing the Rhine got 
to do with a lot of backward Asi- 
atics in a fifth-rate jungle nation 
and the death of everything — of 
my nephew who was the one good 
thing that came out of my flesh?” 

“ — the Nazis,” she said. “The 
horrible Nazis — ” 

Then, sputter ... sputter .. 
sputter . from the phone and — 
“When you hear the tone the 
time will be exactly — ” 

H e slammed the receiver to 
the carriage and breathing 
heavily, stumbled to the bed. He 
lay weak and fearful. 

The sense of being utterly alone 
swept over him. Alone, alone, 
alone the words clattered off the 
walls, shattered against his inner 
ear, echoed down the flesh pas- 
sages to the inner chambers of his 
being. 

Alone. 

Except for an insane voice from 
somewhere that still fought a war 
involving crossing the Rhine and 
Nazis as villains — a voice that rec- 
ognized his with pleasure. 

With pleasure, he thought in 
surprise — but only a voice. People 
did not acknowledge him with 
pleasure. They pretended and 
thought he didn’t see through their 
transparent stratagems to ingrati- 
ate themselves with him. He knew. 
Knew. Knew. As he knew the doc- 
tors who told him there was noth- 
ing wrong with him. 

“There’s nothing wrong with 



you, Mr. Fleiker. Age, yes, with 
all the small degenerations of age, 
but you’re sound as a dollar.” 

“That’s . not very damned 
sound,” he would growl. 

“Well, you know what I mean.” 

“I’m dying,” he would say. 

“You think you're dying,” the 
doctors would say softly. 

“It’s the same thing.” 

“Perhaps.” Pursed lips. “Per- 
haps. Perhaps.” 

What would they think now? 
The final delirium. Hearing voices 
on the phone that told him they 
were talking from the year after 
the Korean War. 1953 or 1954? 
When were armies crossing the 
Rhine. 1945? A voice that knew 
him. That spoke to him gently. 
(People had seldom spoken to him 
gently, even his dead wife who had 
scarcely spoken at all.) 

His ancient heart leaped for an 
instant. His eighty-two-year-old 
heart pounded for an instant and 
he fell back against the pillow, 
blood coursing through the fine 
veining of his face, flushing his 
nose, lips, cheeks with unexpected 
warmth. 

“Oh, God,” he said “Oh, God, 
to play such an irony on me.” 
Cruel, vicious God. (All Gods are 
cruel and vicious. You’ve wor- 
shiped many of them.) Cruel and 
vicious God. 

His quivering fingers found the 
phone. Dialed. Faltered. Dialed 
again. He held the receiver to his 
ears.

He waited. 

Click . 

“When you hear the tone, it will 
be.” 

He sobbed. Pressed the button. 
Dialed again. Waited. Breathing. 
Breathing. Breathing. 

“Hello?” 

“Hello,” he said excitedly. 
“Hello,- it is you? Is it you?” 

“Mark,” she said. “Is it you? 
After eight years? Is it you?” 

“Yes,” he said. “Yes, it’s Mark. 
It’s Mark.” 

“I thought I would never hear 
your voice again. After so many 
years to hear your voice again.” 

“It’s Mark,” he said choking. 

“You don’t sound well,” she 
said. 

“I’m not well,” he said. 

“If I could come just once to 
you.” 

“If you could,” he said. “If only 
you could.” 

“I don’t even know your last 
name. We’ve spoken so few times 
and I don’t even know your last 
name.” 

“Of course, you do,” he said. 
“It’s Fleiker. Mark Fleiker.” 

“That can’t be right,” she said. 
“There’s a Mark Fleiker who’s a 
presidential advisor. I met him 
once — at a reception. My, he was 
handsome — but so intense.” 

“That was 1 — that was years 
ago,” he said. 

“No, not the same at all,” she 
said. “Mark, such a sense of hu- 
mor. Not the same at all.” 



The voice carrying a frown . 
returning to a ... a caress. 

“That was years and years ago,” 
he said. “That was Just before the 
war.” 

“Will there be a war?” she 
asked. “Pray God there won’t be a 
war.” 

“The year before the Japs 
bombed Pearl Harbor,” he said. 
“In nineteen-forty-one, just before 
Pearl Harbor.” 

“Mark, I don’t understand 
you,” she said. 

. Sputter . sputter . The 
connection was going, he knew. 

“Don’t go,” he shouted. 

“Mark,” she said. “I can’t hear 
you. I don’t understand.” 

“Don’t go,” he shouted, “1 love 
you. Don’t go.” 

“Mark . Sputter . Mark, 
you know it’s nineteen-forty-one 
now. You know it’s December 
sixth, a Saturday when school is 
out. You know it’s ...” 

Click . 

“When you hear the tone--” 

December 6, 1941! When you 
hear the tone — 1941 — December 6! 

His hand clawed at the sheets, 
made cabbage folds, knotted them. 
What was she? Where was she? 
Who was she? 

He didn’t even know her name. 
A voice without form, without 
body, without face, without name. 
They must have passed each other 
briefly once. Touched hands, per- 
haps. So long ago and he had not 
known. 



WHEN YOU HEARTHETONE 



125 




I N THAT single instant the sense 
of aloneness, of being lost on the 
edge of time-space had made him 
say it. “1 love you.” The unknown 
emotion had welled inside his an- 
cient frame, coursed through his 
sluggish blood and suddenly he 
knew. He knew it with fear and 
hope and anger and a sense of ut- 
ter loss. 

Love? 

Love doesn’t come this way, he 
told himself. You don’t fall in love 
with a phantom, with something 
that’s a faint image projecting 
through time into the dying pres- 
ent. Youth is a time for love. Not 
love. Not now. Not now. Not with 
a phantom. Not this thing to tor- 
ture me in my last hours, he 
thought. Oh, no, God, not this, not 
this, not this. 

He heard them puttering in the 
hall and he realized he was breath- 
ing heavily. The vultures were 
waiting. They heard him breathing 
his excited rasping breath and they 
were flocking close. He heard the 
doorknob turn and the door began 
to open silently. 

“Stay out,” he shouted. “God 
damn it, stay out. I’ll let you 
know when 1 want you. Stay out.” 
The door closed and he was 
alone again. Alone as he had al- 
ways been. Alone now except for 
the memory of a voice that 
stretched across years and years 
from the past and belonged to a 
woman he did not know and would 
never know. 



What marvels, what magic, his 
little boy mind in the old, old mind 
said. Magic that feeble electric 
currents over copper wires should 
span distances — and years. Alexan- 
der Graham Bell, magician. Mr. — 
what was his name — Mr. Watson, 
sorcerer’s apprentice. Those two 
half a century ago with cauldrons 
and eye of newt and wire of cop- 
per and oil of vitriol and certain 
discrete particles of carbon and . 

And he didn’t even know her 
name. 

Delicate voice, tender voice, ob- 
ject mystical and unseen. Of love? 
One does not love a voice and can- 
not love a voice and you don’t fit 
your aging ideal to a mere voice. 

Only he had. In an impossible 
moment, in an insane working of 
the chemistry of his aged body. 

And he didn’t even know her 
name. 

H e lay for many minutes, 
looking at the cradled phone. 
Thinking wondering, fearing, hop- 
ing, dreading, dreaming, then . 
He couldn’t stop it. He couldn’t 
halt his spotted hand with its lean, 
gray-bristled fingers imbued with 
a life of their own they drifted 
across the sheets, gained new 
strength, became purposeful, 
grasped, held the instrument tight- 
ly, lifted... and his other hand 
with sure touch was dialing. Any 
number. It made no difference. 
Any number. Dial the letters: 6 .

It’s been such a long time.” 

“It’s been only minutes for me,”

“I don’t understand,” she said. 

“What year is it?” he asked. 

“Nineteen-thirty-three,” she 
said. “You know that.” 

“Listen to me,” he said excited-

Here it’s nineteen-seventy.” 

“Oh, my,” she said. “That’s a

She didn’t get angry, he thought. 
Nor annoyed. Marvelous,

Only it’s you later and later and

“That’s strange. What a lovely

“A strange idea. A beautiful

“It’s horrible. I can’t ever see

“I shouldn’t do this,” she said. 
“But I’ll see you.” 

“I can’t,” he said. “I can’t, I 
can’t. Don’t you understand? It’s

“Where are you?” she asked. 
“San Francisco. Twin Peaks.” 
“I’m only blocks away. Jones

“Years away,” he said.

“Hello — hello?” A man’s voice, 
deep, resonant. 

“Hello,” he shouted. 

A grunt of displeasure. 

“Hello,” he shouted. 

“Mr. Watson,” the voice said. 
“Come here. I need you.” 

After that there was silence. 
Long, long, long, dead silence. 
Not even a sputter. Not even a 
click. 

Only silence. 

He returned the receiver to the 
hook, feeling tired and old and 
quite ready to close his eyes and 
never open them again. 

I T WAS too late. Rather too ear- 
ly. Back to the very beginning 



and beyond that year, that day, 
that moment there would be noth- 
ing. The ancient copper would be 
dead because before that instant 
when Mr. Bell had spilled the acid 
of the battery and called for his 
helper, there was nothing. No 
voices, no Angela, no hope — ever. 

He felt like sobbing but it re- 
quired too much energy. He had 
little left. There was only lying in 
bed and staring at the wall and lis- 
tening to the whisper of the doc- 
tors and the insipid questions of 
endless nephews and knowing that 
the days stretched out without 
hope, without feature, without 
pity. 

Angela Haym — and something 
else. One syllable. Two syllables? 
He wasn’t even sure he had the 
first one right. There had been so 
much static and the quality of the 
transmission from the primitive 
phone was so bad. 

He grabbed the directory and 
thumbed to the H’s. Impossible. 
Haymaker — Hayman (See also: 
Heyman — Heiman — Heimann; 
Heymann — Hyman). Then Hay- 
mend, Haymer, Haymond. An im- 
possible task. He counted them. 
Thirteen, not counting commercial 
listings under Haym... then 
Heym . then Heim . 

Then seventy-eight listings. Im- 
possible. 

He didn’t even know if she were 
still alive. Or still in the city. Or 
even that she still had the same last 
name. She could have married.

She hadn’t on the first call. At 
least she hadn’t seemed married. 
A schoolteacher. 

Memory. What had she. said? 
After she retired? She had gone to 
the class reunion. In Denver? 

His fingers skipped to the yellow 
pages. Hopefully. Under Associa- 
tions. University of Denver... 
The Alumni association. One im- 
possible chance. 

He called. A woman answered. 
He invented a story. He couldn't 
remember the exact last name. 
Could she help? After long mo- 
ments he had three names that 
might be she. 

He started to call. Praying. 

On the third call a voice an- 
swered and he said breathlessly, 
“Angela Haymeyer?’’ 

“Yes,” the voice said. 

“This is Mark Fleiker.” 

“Who?” 

His heart sank. This was the last 



one. There was no other. What 
would he do? 

“Mark Fleiker,” he said tiredly. 

“Oh, Mark,” she said. “After 
all these years. After all these 
years.” 

Breath caught in his throat. Sud- 
den panic, fear. 

“Angela,” he said, “can you en- 
tertain a gentleman caller? An old 
friend.” 

“After all these years? An old 
friend?” 

“An old friend,” he said. 

“What a pleasure it would be!” 

“It will be,” he said, feeling sud- 
denly alive, young-old — alive. 

“It will be such a pleasure after 
all these years,” he said. 

And, not waiting for the click, 
he replaced the receiver and began 
to dress. 

“After all these years,” he said 
aloud to the empty room and felt 
very, very good. ir

own suggested list of names ^until, 
by the twentieth century, few 
maps agreed. 

To bring some order out of cha- 
os, the International Astronomical 
Union, in 1922, appointed a com- 
mittee to study and clarify the 
nomenclature. Its final report, pre- 
pared by Mary Blagg and Karl 
Muller was accepted by the Union 
and published in 1935. At that 
time, their catalog contained 672 
n^med formations. 



W HEN GALILEO, in 1610, 
first turned his newly invented 
telescope on the moon, he saw a 
new and independent world. He 
saw mountains and flat, dark 
areas, which he took to be seas. He 
was not a skilled artist, but he was 
the first to produce a map of the 
lunar surface. Other astronomers 
followed, preparing maps of in- 
creasing accuracy. In 1647, the 
amateur astronomer, Hevelius, 
published a map that was appre- 
ciably more detailed and accurate 
than any of the earlier charts. He 
assigned 250 names to various 
moon features, most of them for 
geographical features known on 
earth. 

Several years later, in 1651, the 
Jesuit astronomer, Riccioli, pre- 
pared a still more accurate map 
whose features he named largely 
for famous scientists, philosophers 
and theologians. Dozens of other 
selenographers, professional and 
amateur, followed, each with his 



A nd so matters remained until 
October, 1959, when Soviet 
scientists first photographed the 
moon’s far side from an orbiting 
vehicle and transmitted the pic- 
tures back to earth by a television 
technique. In 1961, the l.A.U. rec- 
ognized this achievement by ap- 
proving names for 18 of the fea- 
tures shown on the photographs. 
Of these, four could not be ideni- 
fied on later and sharper photo- 
graphs and had to be relocated. 

In 1964, the Union approved 
some 65 new names, assigned to 
features that wander in and out of 
view on the very edges of the lunar 
surface visible from earth. But the 
most significant change made that 
year was the recognition of the 
growing importance of lunar 
studies. Prior to that time, the 
moon had been lumped with the 
planets, but then it was given its 
own special commission of 
which — to my surprise — 1 was 
asked to serve as President. 



130 



GALAXY 



Three years later, at the meet- 
ing in Prague, Czechoslovakia, new 
lunar data had come in from both 
the USA and the USSR, espe- 
cially the excellent photographs 
taken by vehicles of the NASA 
Lunar Orbiter series. Hence no 
new assignments were made, but a 
special Working Group was 
appointed, of which I was Chair- 
man, to name the craters on the 
moon’s far side. Other members 
included the Soviet astronomer A. 
Mikhailov, who was later replaced 
by B. Levin. M. Minnaert of the 
Netherlands was the third official 
member and A. Dollfus of France, 
the new President of the Lunar 
Commission, was also a member, 
ex-officio. 

For three solid years our Com- 
mittee of four worked hard at its 
assigned task. We wanted the 
moon to be truly international. 
Hence my first act was to write to 
the National Academies of Sci- 
ence or equivalent bodies of all na- 
tions of the world, asking them for 
suggestions concerning their own 
famous scientists. Members of the 
Lunar Commission supplied addi- 
tional names until we started out 
with a card catalogue containing 
more than 1500 suggestions. 
Paring this down to the desired 
number of about 500 was an 
arduous task. We divided the final 
list into about five orders of dis- 
tinction and then assigned the 
names by lot to the craters also di- 
vided into five categories. 



The most delicate question con- 
cerned the possibility of recogniz- 
ing living astronauts. For nearly 
forty years the lAU had ruled 
against the inclusion of any living 
individuals, but our Committee 
felt that the inauguration of the 
age of space, which included 
actual travel to the moon, war- 
ranted special treatment. 

One especially large feature on 
the moon’s far side, with a com- 
plex array of smaller craters 
around it, received the name 
Apollo, to commemorate the 
entire Apollo Program and all 
those who had contributed to it. 
The three living astronauts, 
Anders, Borman, and Lovell, the 
first to circumnavigate the 
moon, received features near the 
crater Apollo. Aldrin, Armstrong 
and Collins, the first to partici- 
pate in a lunar landing, received 
previously unnamed craters near 
the landing site, which was called 
Tranquillity Base or by its Latin 
equivalent Situs Tranquilitatis. 
Six living cosmonauts of the 
USSR also received craters on the 
far side near the Sea of Moscow, 
which had been named in 1961. 
These included, among others, 
Leonev, the first man to walk in 
space and Tereshkova, the first 
and, to date, the only female cos- 
monaut to achieve orbital flight. 

I should state that the Commit- 
tee quickly agreed to rule out all 
political figures. We also ruled out 
philosophers and religious figures. 



WHO'S WHO ON THE MOON 



131 




Our final list, which contained 513 
new' names, was approved at the 
final General Assembly of the In- 
ternational Astronomical Union 
on August 27, 1970, in Brighton, 
England. 

I CAN scarcely comment in any 
detail on a list of names so large. 
Physical scientists were in the great 
majority, especially when they had 
made some special contribution to 
astronomy. 

There were, of course, a number 
of Nobel Prize winners and Nobel, 
himself, was also honored. We 
found room for a number of inven- 
tors: Bell of the telephone, 

Marconi of wireless telegraphy, de 
Forest of the vacuum tube and 
Montgolfier of balloon fame. 1 
was pleased that we agreed to hon- 
or several amateur astronomers 
of unusual distinction, among 
them Albert L. Ingalls, who popu- 
larized the making of telescopes, 
wrote frequently for The Scientific 
American and served as one of the 
founders of the Amateur Tele- 
scope Makers. 

From the large list of author 
candidates we selected only a few. 
Chaucer made it because he had 
written a treatise on the astrolabe. 
We selected Dante for his (largely 
erroneous) contributions to cos- 
mogony. Readers of Galaxy will 
be pleased to learn that the former 
science editor, Willy Fey, received 
the honor. I had had dozens of let- 
ters from fans of his, expressing 



the hope for such recognition. Two 
other great writers of science fic- 
tion also made it, H.G. Wells and 
Hugo Gernsback. The annual 
world award for the best science 
fiction is called a “Hugo” in his 
honor. Jules Verne had already 
been assigned a crater in 1961. 
George Gamow made it on the 
basis of his contributions to phys- 
ics, though he is perhaps better 
known for his popular writings. 
The author Cyrano de Bergerac, 
who wrote of imaginary visits to 
the moon and the sun early in the 
seventeenth century took his place 
among the greats. 

The three deceased American 
astronauts; Chaffee, Grissom and 
White, who were killed in the 
ground-fire of an Apollo test craft, 
received craters near the large 
crater Apollo. There were two de- 
ceased Soviet cosmonauts. Kom- 
arov was killed in the crash-land- 
ing of Soyuz I, when the parachute 
failed. Gagarin, the first man to 
carry out a space flight back in 
1961, was killed in a crash on an 
aircraft training flight. 

We thought it appropriate to 
recognize one other early astro- 
naut, Van Gu, a Chinese inventor 
who lived about 1500 A.D. Accord- 
ing to legend he constructed a 
manned rocket consisting of two 
box kites and a seat, with 47 solid- 
propellant rockets. He perished 
while trying to take off in the con- 
traption. Similarly, we included 
the mythical figures of Daedalus 



132 



GALAXY 




and his son, Icarus. The former 
was a cunning artisan who, in the 
second millennium B.C., made 
wings of wax and feathers so that 
the two could escape from Crete. 
Icarus, youthfully exuberant, flew 
too close to the sun the heat 
melted the wax wings, so that he 
fell into the sea and drowned, while 
Daedalus flew on and landed safely 
in Sicily. 

These are but a few of the fa- 
mous names recognized officially 
by the International Astronomical 
Union. The assignment wa$ a fas- 
cinating and rewarding one. Per- 
haps the most satisfying experience 
of all was the moment at Brighton 
when the General Assembly 
unanimously passed our recom- 
mendations. 

The final maps are being pre- 
pared by the Aeronautical Chart 
and Information Center in St. 
Louis. The complete list, with 
biographies and latitudes of the 
craters will probably be published 
in the Space Science Reviews, a 
journal of space astronomy edited 
in Utrecht, Netherlands. I'm sure 
that a good many independent 
groups will presently issue lunar 
maps based on the l.A.U. official 
list. 

The complete lunar map on a 
scale of 1:5,000,000, consisting of 
three sheets, should become avail- 
able about mid-October from the 
Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing 
Office, Washington, D.C., 20402, 




at an estimated cost of 50 cents 
per sheet. 

T he space age has led to enor- 
mous changes in style and con- 
vention of astronomical maps, 
especially those of the moon and 
planets. When an astronomer, 
living in the northern hemisphere, 
faces directly south and looks up 
into the sky, he will have east on his 
left hand and west on his right. He 
sees the moon in the sky and, in the 
past, chose the compass coordi- 
nates on the moon to agree with 
his own view: north on the top, 
south at the bottom, east to the 
left and west to the right, as shown 
in Fig. 1. As a result his maps of 
the moon looked something like 
Fig. 2, with east and west reversed 
from the conventional use on earth. 



Fig. 2 




WHO'S WHO ON THE MOON 



133 




This result came about, of 
course, from the fact that one 
makes the maps of the earth while 
looking down, whereas the 
astronomer drew the moon map 
while looking up at the sky. And, 
to make the situation even more 
complicated, the astronomical 
telescopes turn the object upside 
down, so that scientists usually 
drew their maps with south up, as 
in Fig. 3. 




Fig. 3 



Astronauts, early in the pro- 
gram, began to find this conven- 
tion confusing. Finally the Inter- 
national Astronomical Union, the 
organization responsible for such 
decisions, dropped the age-old con- 
vention and decreed that hence- 
forth maps of the moon and planets 
would conform to the same con- 
vention as for the familiar ter- 
restrial maps, with north at the top, 
east to the right, and so on. This 
change required a complete rever- 
sal of the directions previously 
called east and west to become 
west and east, respectively. 

The change was not only 
necessary; it was timely because 
the Orbiter photographs contain 



new information about the moon’s 
far side and improved informa- 
tion about the near side. New and 
highly detailed maps have thus be- 
come possible. 

These changes have introduced 
certain difficulties. For example, 
Mare Orientale — The Eastern 
Sea — by the new convention lies 
on the western edge of the visible 
lunar surface. This dark, multi- 
ringed feature is easily the most 
magnificent circular formation on 
the moon. Surrounded by two 
concentric mountain ranges, the 
Montes Rook and the Monies 
Cordillera, this sea is approx- 
imately 600 miles in diameter. The 
new location presented a problem 
to the Working Group. Should we 
change its name? For a time we 
toyed with the idea of calling it 
Mare A nnulatum. The Ringed 
Sea. But we decided, after all, that 
the original name was quite appro- 
priate. We rejected Kipling’s 
famous lines, “East is East and 
West is West and never the twain 
shall meet’’ as being wrong. Eor, if 
you went far enough to the east you 
would eventually reach Mare 
Orientale. 

Just how do astronomers go 
about assigning latitudes and 
longitudes on the moon? To under- 
stand this problem one has only to 
see how we have done it for the 
earth. The earth has a north pole 
and south pole, fixed by the posi- 
tion of the earth’s axis of rotation. 
The equator, halfway between the 



134 



GALAXY 





two poles, divides the earth into 
two hemispheres: north and south. 
Latitude is the angular distance 
measured north or south from the 
equator along the meridian drawn 
from the equator to the pole 
through some city or other point of 
the earth’s surface. The latitude of 
the pole is 90°N. Next we choose 
some arbitrary meridian and 
measure longitude east or west 
from the point where it touches the 
equator to the foot of the other 
meridian. On earth, this zero or 
standard meridian passes through 
the old observatory at Greenwich, 
England. 

For the moon, we follow the 
same basic principle. By observa- 
tion, we determine the position of 
the moon’s north and south poles 
of rotation. A few people have 
argued, sometimes vociferously, 
that the moon does not rotate at 
all, because it keeps the same face 
turned always toward the earth. 
They are, of course, thinking of 
the analogy of a solid ball attached 
rigidly to a rotating crankshaft. 
Actually, the moon’s rotation on 
its axis and its orbital revolution 
around the earth are quite inde- 
pendent of one another. First of all, 
the axial rotation is extremely 
regular and uniform. The axis of 
rotation is inclined several degrees 
to the perpendicular to the orbital 
plane. As a result, for half the 
month we see a slight distance 
over the moon’s north pole and for 
the other half we see beyond the 



south pole. This slight motion is 
called “libration in latitude.” 

But that isn’t the only effect of 
the moon’s motion. The orbit 
around the earth is not a circle but 
a pronounced ellipse. Flow fast the 
moon traverses the orbit depends 
on where it is. When near the earth, 
the moon speeds up; when farther 
away it slows down. As a conse- 
quence, we see some distances 
around the eastern and western 
edges of the disk. This motion is 
called “libration in longitude,” 
Hence we can see from the earth 
not just one half but five ninths of 
the lunar surface. Of course, all 
but a tiny fraction of the remain- 
der has been photographed by spe- 
cial cameras sent to the moon by 
the United States of America and 
by the Soviets. 

To return to the problem of 
lunar mapping, we can easily lo- 
cate the moon’s two poles. 

Our North Star, however, will 
not serve as such for the moon, be- 
cause its axis is tilted with respect 
to that of the earth, even though 
the axes of both bodies tend to stay 
parallel to their original positions 
throughout the month and the 
year. The lunar equator lies half- 
way between the two poles so de- 
termined. Then one’s fix is a merid- 
ian to represent zero longitude ar- 
bitrarily through the average posi- 
tion of the side turned earthward. 

The compass directions stay the 
same on both sides. On both sides, 
east longitude increases from left

to right and west longitude from 
left to right. 

This new principle of cartogra- 
phy of the moon and planets re- 
ceived the official approval of the 
International Astronomical Union. 



The assignment of selecting 
names for the craters on the 
moon’s far side was exciting and 
interesting. Hundreds of persons, 
not knowing the restriction against 
living people, have generously of- 
fered their own names as “repre- 
sentative of the common man.” 
Others have suggested names of 
their towns, cities, pets. Several 
companies, rather brashly, offered 
their own names, for the adver- 
tising benefit. Somehow or other it 
reminded me of a story 1 read in 
my childhood of a manufacturer 
who built a huge and powerful pro- 
jector that threw upon the moon 
as a screen the words; 

USE MOON SOAP. ★

LIBRA TION IN LA TITUDE. The axis of the moon’s 
rotation is tilted about 5 degrees with respect to the 
perpendicular to its orbit around the earth. Thus, when 
the moon is at a we see a trifle around the north pole. 
When it is at the arrow we see around the edge of the 
south pole. The axis of the moon’s rotation tends to 
move parallel to itself.

Gyration in 

IF the moon moved exactly in a circular orbit, as in a, 
b, c — h, meanwhile rotating on its axis, the black spot 
on its surface would always point directly toward the 
center of the earth and we would see only the nearer 
face of the moon. 

However, the moon’s orbit is elliptical a', b', c — h' 
and the moon moves more rapidly when near the earth 
than when more distant. As a result, during the time it 
would take for the moon to move from a to b in the 
circular orbit, it has moved from a to b along the el- 
lipse. The black spot at b no longer points directly 
earthward. We see a little way around one side of the 
moon. The moon slows down as it approaches point 
e. Then we begin to see at f, g', and h’ , part way 
around the other side of the moon.

T he General Chairman here 
he had, by custom, no other 
name — paced across the soft 
carpeting of his office, hands 
clasped behind his back. He 
stopped at the wide sweep of win- 
dows that overlooked the town. 

There was little of old Messina 
to be seen. The storied city of an- 
cient churches and houses chalk- 
white in the fierce Sicilian sunlight 
had been all but swallowed up by 
the metal and glass towers of the 
world government- offices, as- 
sembly halls, hotels and residence 
buildings, shops and entertain- 
ment centers for the five million 
men and w'omen who ruled Earth’s 
twenty-some billions. 

In the air-conditioned, sound- 
proofed office atop the tallest of 
all the towers, the General Chair- 
man could not hear the shrill 
voices of the crowded streets be- 
low', nor the constant growl of 
cars and turbotrucks on the busy 
throughways. 

A l least we saved some of the old 
city, he thought. The feat had been 
one of his first successes in world 
politics. A small thing. But he had 
helped to stop the growth of New 
Messina before it completely 
choked and killed its predecessor. 
The new city had now remained 
the same size for thirty years. 

Beyond the waterfront fishing 
boats the straits sparkled in- 
vitingly under the sun. And visible 



beyond them was the tip of Italy’s 
boot, Calabria, where peasants 
still prided themselves on their 
hard-headed stubbornness. High 
above Calabria’s misty blue hills, 
shimmering in the heat haze, the 
sterner blue of the sky was too 
bright to look at for more than a 
moment. 

The. old man knew his eyes were 
playing tricks when he thought he 
saw the glint of one of the big or- 
bital stations hovering in that bril- 
liant sky. He squinted worked a 
forefinger and thumb against the 
bridge of his nose. Today he 
seemed to be feeling his years. 

He thought about his native Sao 
Paulo- it had spread like a fes- 
tering sore all the way from the 
river to the sea, flattening hills, 
carving away forests. Teeming with 
so many people that not even the 
Population Control Center's com- 
puters could keep track of them. 
No sane man would willingly en- 
ter the heart of Sao Paulo or 
any large city on Earth. Humans 
no longer could live in the crawl- 
ing guts of a city df they had to, 
they became something else. 

The desktop intercom chimed. 

“Yes?” The Chairman auto- 
matically switched from the Portu- 
guese of his thoughts to the English 
of the world government. He 
pressed a button. 

His secretary appeared on the 
screen. Her face was somber. 

“They’re here, sir.” 

“Very well. Send them in.”

Six men and two women filed 
into the spacious office and took 
seats at the conference table. They 
carried no papers, no briefcases. 
Each place at the table had a tiny 
intercom and viewscreen that 
linked with the central computer. 

They are young — they have 
vitality, thought the Chairman. 
They know what must be done and 
they have the strength to do it. As 
soon as alt this is settled, I shall re- 
tire. Resume my identity as a per- 
son- not Mr. Chairman . 

Suddenly the prospect of using 
his own name again in casual con- 
tact with his fellow humans seemed 
infinitely exciting. 

Reluctantly he took his place at 
the head of the glistening mahoga- 
ny table. The others were silent, 
waiting. The only sound was a 
faint whir of the computer’s re- 
cording spool. 

He cleared his throat. “Good 
morning. Last Monday we dis- 
cussed this situation and you made 
your recommendation. I asked 
you to consider possible alterna- 
tives. From the looks on your 
faces, it seems that no suitable 
alternative has been found.” 

All turned to the stocky, round- 
faced Minister of Security, 
Kobryn. He had the look of an ath- 
lete; tanned skin, short wiry brown 
hair, big shoulders and arms. 

Shifting in his chair self- 
consciously, Kobryn said, “I see I 
have been elected hatchet man.” 
His voice was deep and strong. 



with a trace of Slavic accent. “All 
right the idea was mine 
originally. We ran all the alter- 
natives through computers. The 
only safe answer remains 
permanent exile.” 

“Siberia,” one of the women 
muttered. 

“No, not Siberia.” Kobryn took 
her literally. “It’s too heavily 
populated. Too many cities and 
dome farms for an effective exile. 
No, the only place is the new space 
station. It's large enough and it 
can be kept completely isolated.” 
Bernard, the Minister of Fi- 
nance, shook his head. “1 still dis- 
agree. Two thousand of the 
world’s leading scientists 

“Plus their wives and families,” 
the Chairman added. 

“What would you prefer'?” Ko- 
bryn snapped. “A bullet in each of 
their heads'? Or would you leave 
them alone and let them smash 
everything we have worked for'?” 
“That won’t work,” said Mot- 
tern, the taciturn Minister of Tech- 
nology. “Even if they tried to coop- 
erate with us you can’t stop ideas 
from spreading. And once their 
genetic engineering discoveries 
leak out 

“The world is turned upside 
down,” the Chairman said. He 
spoke softly but everyone heard 
him. With a sigh he confessed, “1 
also have been thinking about the 
problem -have tried to find alter- 
natives. There are none. Exile is the 
only answer.” 



EXILED FROM EARTH

“It is then agreed. Good!” said 
Kobryn. 

“No, not good,” the General 
Chairman said. “Far from it. We 
are admitting our own failure. Our 
fear even terror. We are terrified 
of a new idea, a new scientific 
discovery. The government of the 
world, the protectors of peace and 
stability, must stoop to exiling 
some of the world’s finest minds. 
This state of affairs is horrible. 
Truly horrible.”

L OU CHRISTOPHER slid 
into the cockpit of his rocket 
glider. It fit him as snugly as his 
flight coveralls. Only his head and 
shoulders poked above the cock- 
pit’s rim. 

“Takeoff for the thirty-meter 
class contest in five minutes,” said 
the loudspeaker at the edge of the 
crowded field. 

fVhere's Bonnie? Lou asked him- 
self. She should've been here fif- 
teen minutes ago . 

He looked across the sun-baked 
field. It was cluttered with sleek 
rocket gliders, each tilted on one 
wingtip. They looked as ungainly 
as grounded pelicans but once in 
the air, they turned into graceful 
fliers. Vehicles moved back and 
forth. Knots of people clustered 
around each glider, talking 
earnestly, arguing over maps, 
tinkering with least-minute im- 
patience on the gliders themselves. 



Then everything stopped and 
they all looked up as a rocket mo- 
tor roared to life and a glider 
streaked by, climbing at a crazy 
angle, heading for the sky. 

The man-made thunder rumbled 
and slowly died. Contestants went 
back to their tasks of preparation. 
Lou sat alone. The air was hot, 
though the hour was still early. The 
only shade on the field was made 
by the gliders themselves. 

Where is she? Lou liked to work 
alone; didn’t want other people 
messing around his glider. But 
Bonnie was different. She was his 
girl. And her absence at a time 
like this was unusual. He began to 
worry. Later he was to remember 
that Bonnie’s absence was the first 
thing to go wrong today. 

He worked the control stick, 
squinting back over his shoulder 
to see the ailerons at the ends of 
the long drooping wings Hick up 
and down in response. Then the 
rudder pedals, left foot, right, left. 
In the mirror atop the instrument 
panel he could see the rudder 
swing back and forth. Flaps. Ele- 
vators. Trim tabs. 

“Final check-out for thirty- 
meter class entries,” boomed the 
loudspeaker. 

Lou spotted Bonnie, driving the 
turbosport across the outskirts of 
the field, kicking up a plume of 
dust, her yellow hair catching the 
New Mexico sun. She slowed 
down, nosed the car between a 
pair of gliders and coasted to a stop

in front of Lou’s plane. He waved. 

She jumped out of the car and 
Lou found himself grinning, en- 
joying the sight of her long-legged 
trim figure and her lovely face, 
wide-eyed with excitement. 

“Randerson’s ahead of all of 
yesterday’s entries,” she said 
breathlessly as she ran to the 
cockpit. “His official distance was 
twenty-one hundred and fifty-five 
kilometers. I stayed at the control 
center while the computer ran off 
the final numbers. He made it all 
the way to Spartansburg, South 
Carolina.” 

Lou let out a soft whistle. 
“That’ll be hard to beat. Es- 
pecially after I’ve been sitting here 
frying my brains for half an 
hour.” 

“Oh — did I keep you waiting?” 
Her face went from excitement to 
concern. “Oh Lou, I’m sorry I 
thought you’d want to hear about 
Randerson — ” 

He laughed. “Forget it. Gimme 
a kiss, quick. And get my helmet. 
Here come the starters.” 

Bonnie dashed back to the car 
for the helmet as the starting judge 
and safety officer walked up to 
Lou’s glider. The judge was tall, 
lean, leathery and in his late 
forties. He had the high cheek- 
bones and sad, suspicious eyes of 
an Apache. He turned to the safety 
officer. 

“This is entry eleven. Is he 
checked out?” 

The safety officer, a stocky red- 



head, was sweating. He looked 
down at his clipboard. “Controls 
check. Structures check. Instru- 
ments check. Motors check, 
except for a slight crack on the lip 
of number three nozzle. Nothing 
serious, though. Radio check.” 

The judge’s eyes narrowed. 
“You sure that nozzle’s okay? 
Don’t want him splattering some 
farmhouse. Remember that dude 
from Massachusetts last year — 
busted an irrigation line when he 
crashed. Left half the county with- 
out water for a week. Ruined the 
corn crop for the whole season.” 
Pleasant guy, Lou thought. 
Wonder what happened to the 
pilot, 

“It’ll be okay,” the safety of- 
ficer said. 

The judge shrugged barely per- 
ceptibly. 

“Okay. Let me see his route.” 
The safety officer Hipped a page 
on his clipboard and showed it to 
the judge. He glanced at it, then 
looked up at Lou. 

“Charleston, South Carolina? 
Going for a record?” 

Lou nodded. 

The judge seemed more an- 
noyed than pleased. “Let me see 
his emergency landing sites.” 

It's all there, everything the rules 
require and more. I’m not in- 
terested in being a dead hero. 

Finally the judge looked up 
again. “Seems good enough. 
Everybody at those emergency 
sites been notified?” 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



143 




“Yes,” Lou and the safety 
officer said together. 

The judge smiled charily. 
“Okay. Cleared for takeoff. And 
good luck.” 

Lou exhaled. “Thanks. I’ll send 
you a wirephoto from Charleston.” 

“You do that,” the judge said. 
And again he smiled, more gen- 
erously than before. 

The judge and safety officer 
walked to the next glider. Bonnie 
handed Lou his helmet. He pulled 
it on. It always scraped his ears. 

Bonnie giggled. 

“What’s funny?” 

“The face you make when you 
put on your helmet.” 

“You won’t laugh when I have 
cauliflower ears,” he grumbled. 

She reached up, put her arms 
around his neck and kissed him. 
“Good luck.” 

“Thanks. See you in Charles- 
ton.” 

She returned to the car, hooked 
the towline to the glider’s nose 
and started the turbine engine. 

Her voice sounded in his ear- 
phones. 

“Ready?” 

Lou said, “Let’s go.” 

“You sure that nozzle won’t 
blow out on you?” 

“Sure. If it does. I’ll steer clear 
of irrigation lines.” 

S HE gunned the car’s engine. 

Lou jerked back in his seat 
slightly. He kept the control stick 
pushed forward so the glider 



would not lift off too soon. The tiny 
wheels under each wingtip stayed 
in place as the car gained speed and 
they bumped across the dusty field. 
Last trip one of the wheels had 
worked loose and the wingtip had 
dug into the ground. The glider 
had groundlooped and it had tak- 
en him two months to put it back in 
shape again. 

He was rolling faster now, clear 
of the other gliders, out in the 
open. Bonnie was a good tow. 
Brush and rocks whirled by. His 
wingtips cleared the ground and 
the glider was rolling on its un- 
derbelly wheel alone. Lou’s left 
hand reached for the towline re- 
lease switch. 

When he was off the ground, 
smooth and free, he punched the 
towline release. The wheels fell 
away nicely too. The glider 
climbed easily and he put her into 
a wide sweeping turn, banked and 
saw Bonnie in the car racing af- 
ter the bouncing main wheel as it 
caromed across the desert. Lou 
waved to her but she failed to see. 
Then he slid the plastic canopy 
shut. 

“Entry eleven, this is control. 
We have acquired you on radar 
and are tracking you. Approach 
the starting tower, please. Head- 
ing one-three-zero.” 

“Okay, control. I see the start- 
ing tower. Is that you, Billy?” 

“Yep. You gonna be climbing as 
you pass the tower, Lou?” 

“Yes.” 



144 



GALAXY 




“Want a countdown?” 

“Please.” 

“All right, you got. Wait just a 
tick here — okay, fifteen seconds 
on my mark — mark, fifteen sec- 
onds ” 

Lou set the timer on his instru- 
ment panel and punched the auto- 
matic fire sequence button. A light 
above it began flashing amber. 

“- ten seconds — ” 

Number three motor will fire 
last in the automatic sequence, 
Lou thought. If it blows, at least 
I'll be high enough to glide to a 
landing. If there's enough of the 
plane left. 

“ — three — two -one- zero — ” 
Number one bellowed beautiful- 
ly and Lou was plastered to his 
seat, rattling in the vibration of 
the rocket’s thrust. He pulled the 
stick back into his belly and all he 
could see was the blue sky ahead of 
him, scratched by some faint wisps 
of cirrus far above. He’d pass 
them in seconds. 

“Entry eleven, this is control.” A 
different voice. A stranger. “Abort 
your rocket sequence and return 
to the field immediately.” 

“What? What’s wrong?” 
“Federal marshal wants to see 
you right away.” 

“Federal marshal? You’re kid- 
ding.” The timer on the instru- 
ment panel showed that number 
one’s burn was almost finished 
and number two would ignite. 
Unless Lou pushed the abort but- 
ton. 



“It’s no joke, eleven. Return to 
the field at once.” 

“Sorry — tell him to grab a jet 
and meet me in Charleston.” 

A splutter of rage came from his 
earphones as number two ig- 
nited. Lou switched off the radio. 
And crossed his fingers. 

He streaked past the cirrus 
clouds, feeling the rocket’s roar 
rather than hearing it now, with 
number two burning. The hand of 
the timer swept around toward 
the top of the dial again and num- 
ber three lit off. Instantly Lou 
could feel the change in the vibra- 
tion. He clamped his teeth togeth- 
er and the plane shook. 

If it gets any worse. 

But it didn’t. She held together. 
And suddenly the burn was over. 
The vibration and thunder in his 
bones died and Lou was gliding 
fifteen miles above the great 
southwestern desert, a silent, 
long-winged bird of plastic and 
metal heading into the morning 
sun, coasting far higher and fast- 
er.than any eagle. The mountains 
to his left were mere wrinkles and 
the clouds were thin patches of 
white resting like frost on ground 
far below. 



T his was the easy part of the 
flight, the best part. He was To- 
tally alone. Completely away 
from all the people who crawled 
over each others’s lives below. A 
man could only take it f6r so long 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



145 




and then he had to get away — away 
from everybody and everything. 
This was the best way. Bonnie 
would be waiting for him in 
Charleston, of course. And if he 
didn’t make it that far she'd soon 
jet to wherever he landed. In two 
days he had to be back at the Insti- 
tute. It was a good place to work. 
But nothing compared to this. He 
shut his mind to everything be- 
low. 

The sky was a shade of purple 
you could never see from the 
ground, clean and pure. A half 
moon hung off his port wingtip, a 
pale and ghostly moon, large and 
close. The only sound was the thin 
whisper of wind against the cano- 
py bubble. Lou kept the radio off 
except when he had to make a 
scheduled report to the ground 
stations along his route. Amaril- 
lo, Dallas, then across the twisting 
gray snake of the Mississippi, 
Jackson, Birmingham - the voices 
from the ground were more ex- 
cited at each step of the way. His 
route followed the curving paths-of 
the summer Jetstream, the invisi- 
ble river of air that races across 
the continent and helped keep the 
glider coasting high above the 
cares of men. 

Inevitably, his thoughts finally 
turned to his work at the Insti- 
tute. The geneticists and bio- 
chemists were almost where they 
wanted to go the experiments 
over the past six months had turned 
out even better than they had 



hoped. Now they were waiting for 
Lou to program the computer 
for them for the next phase. All 
those brilliant doctors of science 
were completely hung up until 
Lou Christopher finished teach- 
ing the computer how to handle 
their work. He grinned to himself. 
You've come a long way. for a lit- 
tle kid from a hick college. 

And again felt the lift of total 
freedom. Let the bigdomes wait. 

It was an hour or so before lo- 
cal sunset when Lou dipped the 
glider low enough to feel the tur- 
bulence of weather. Up in the 
high stratosphere and above the 
sailing was almost always 
smooth. Suddenly over the 
Smoky Mountains, the glider be- 
gan to lose altitude too fast, 
bounding, lurching in the wave of 
mountain winds. He had to find 
thermals and stretch his final 
glide- or not make Charleston. 

Lou turned the radio to control 
frequency and transmitted: 
“This is entry eleven, thirty-meter 
class, from Albuquerque, re- 
questing landing instructions.” 

Without a moment's hesitation 
a girl's honey-rich voice answered, 
“We see y'all, Albuquerque 
eleven. We’re using the old air 
base, bearing about ninety de- 
grees from your heading. Please 
turn to frequency tew-fo’-seven 
for landing guidance. And con- 
gratulations! Y’all set a new 
range record today!” 

“Thank you.” Lou set the new 



146 



GALAXY 




frequency on his radio, while the 
careful part of his mind told him, 
ll's not a new record until you 
land the bird in one piece. 

Lou knew that the Charleston 
club used an abandoned Air Force 
base, but he was surprised to see 
how huge the runways were. Those 
old bombers must have been real 
monsters. He saw a cluster of peo- 
ple and cars beside the old control 
tower and dozens of twenty-meter 
and smaller gliders parked on the 
access ramp. On closer view, the 
concrete of the miles-long run- 
ways was broken and invaded by 
patches of grass. Lou touched his 
skids to the concrete and screeched 

bouncing, grinding, lurching- 
down the runway until a slight rise 
slowed the glider to a dusty halt. 

And it was finished. He sat in 
the lengthening shadows of late af- 
ternoon, suddenly aware that he 
was sweating. In some distant 
trees a songbird was warbling. 
The turbines of many cars were 
roaring to life. 

He saw the storm lightning 
flicker far to his right. Stay clear 
of that. A thunderstorm could 
snap the wings off the glider in an 
instant. 

The plane had started its flight 
like a rocket, then coasted like a 
baby satellite. Now it was flying 
like a soarplane Lou was 
stretching for the last few pre- 
cious kilometers, looking for ther- 
mals, sailing from one rising bub- 
ble of heated air to another, try- 



ing to avoid unpleasant things 
like mountainsides and trees and 
TV masts. 

Earlier in his flight he had had 
the radio turned on only intermit- 
tently. Now he kept it on full time. 
There was a good deal of chatter 
on the air but he dialed it all out 
and stayed with Charleston's auto- 
matic homing signal. That was 
his goal. The beeping signal faded 
as he lost altitude or dipped 
closed to a jutting hill. It grew 
louder as he soared upward and 
came closer to the city. 

Charleston came in view. The 
long shadows of late afternoon 
made details hard to recognize 
but he made out the city, the bay, 
the islands Fort Sumter some- 
where among them. He could even 
see an excursion boat sliding 
smoothly across the bay, trailing 
a white wake. Charleston was still 
what the social engineers called a 
viable city; not large enough for its 
inner sections to have turned into 
barbaric concrete Jungles. As in 
New York and most other cities. 

His shoulders creaked painful- 
ly as he raised his hands to unlatch 
the canopy. He stood up on the 
seat and stretched, then watched 
the procession of cars streaming 
down the field toward him. They 
were tooting their horns in greet- 
ing. Where was Bonnie? He 
couldn’t see her in any of the 
dozens of open-topped cars. 

He clambered down stiffly from 
the cockpit and people reached 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



147 




him, shouting and laughing, 
shaking his hand, pounding his 
back. A girl kissed him. 

Next a tall, hard-looking, thick- 
bodied man stepped up and put a 
heavy hand on Lou’s arm. 

“Louis Christopher, 1 have a 
Federal warrant for your arrest." 

Ill 

B y the time the marshal’s un- 
marked copter flashed over the 
skyline of New York, Lou was furi- 
ous. 

“Why won’t you tell me what 
this is about?" he shouted at the 
marshal who sat beside him on the 
back bench. The two front seats 
were empty the copter was fly- 
ing on autopilot. Its electric en- 
gine hummed quietly; most of the 
noise in the cabin came from the 
blurred whirring of the main 
rotor. 

The marshal sat back, his burly 
arms folded across his chest and his 
sleepy eyes partly closed. 

“Listen, mister, the phone woke 
me up at four this morning. I had 
to race out to thejetport and lly to 
Albuquerque. You hot-shotted 
out of there even when you were 
told not to. I had to grab another 
jet to Charleston. Know what my 
wife and kids are doing right now? 
They’re sitting home, wondering 
whether I’m dead or alive and why 
we’re not all out on the picnic we 
planned. Know how many picnics 
we can afford on a marshal’s pay? 



Been planning this one all 
year -had a spot in the upstate 
park reserved months ago. Now 
it’s going to waste while I bomb all 
across the country after you. So 
don’t ask questions understand?’’ 

Then he added: “Besides, I 
don’t know what kind of mess 
you’re in. 1 had word to pick you 
up, that’s all. When you hot-tailed 
out on me in Albuquerque I 
swore out a warrant for you." 

Lou said, “Well uh — I’m sor- 
ry about your picnic. I never had 
a Federal marshal after me be- 
fore but what I’m really wor- 
ried about is my girl. She was sup- 
posed to meet me in Charleston. 
Her name’s Bonnie Sterne- blond, 
about five-six ’’ 

“I told you -don’t ask ques- 
tions.’’ The marshal closed his 
eyes altogether. “1 wasn’t look- 
ing for any-body except you -if 
Uiat’s what worries you. 1 haven’t 
heard of any pickup out for Bon- 
nie Sterne. The way those others 
were mauling you in Charleston, 
I’m surprised you’re worried 
about Just one girl." 

Lou frowned. The copter was 
now circling over the East River 
and the old United Nations build- 
ings, in the last blood-red light of 
the dying sun. The buildings were 
stained by a century of grime and 
the windows were caked with 
dirt once-beautiful marble was 
cracked and patched- but the 
tower was graceful and tall. 

Two men waited on the landing 



148 



GALAXY 




pad. As soon as the copter’s 
wheels touched the blacktop the 
cabin’s hatch popped open. 

“Out you go,” said the marshal. 

Lou jumped out. The marshal 
reached over and yanked the door 
shut before Lou could turn 
around. The copter’s motor 
whined — it lifted off in a spray of 
dust and grit. 

Sun's already down, Lou 
thought. He'll never make it to 
that picnic. 

The two men were walking 
briskly toward Lou. One was 
small and slim, Latin-looking. 
Probably Puerto Rican. The 
breeze from the river llicked at his 
black hair. The other somehow 
looked like a foreigner. His suit 
wasn’t exactly odd, but it didn't 
look exactly right, either. He 
was big, blond, Nordic-looking. 

“Please come with us,” said the 
Norseman. And sure enough, he 
had a Scandanavian accent. “It is 
my duty to inform you that we are 
both armed. Escape is impossi- 
ble.” 

“Escape from what?’’ Lou 
started to feel exasperated again. 
“What’s this all about? Where’s 
my girl? What’s going to happen 
to my glider? Why — ” 

“Please,” said the Puerto Rican 
softly. “It is getting dark. We 
should not remain outside any 
longer. This way, please.” 

The UN building looked a little 
better inside. The corridor they 
walked down was clean. But the 



carpeting was threadbare and 
faded with a century’s worth of 
footsteps. They took a spacious 
elevator car, paneled with peeling 
wood, up a dozen floors. Then an- 
other corridor, and finally a 
small room. 

The room had one occupant. 

“Dr. Kirby,” Lou said. 

S ITTING on a sofa at the other 
side of the little room was Dr. 
John Kirby of Columbia-Brook- 
haven University. He was in his 
mid-fifties, white-haired, nervous- 
ly thin he had a pinched face, a 
bent and predatory nose. 

Kirby said, “1 don’t seem to re- 
call — ” 

“Louis Christopher,” said Lou. 
His two escorts left him with Dr. 
Kirby and shut the door. “We met 
at the Colorado conference last 
spring, remember?” 

Kirby made a vague gesture 
with his hands. “There are always 
too many people at conferences.” 
Lou sat on the sofa beside him. 
“I gave a paper on computer mod- 
eling for forecasting genetic ad- 
justments. You had a question 
from the floor about the accuracy 
of the forecasts. Afterward we had 
lunch together.” 

“Oh yes. The computer fellow. 
You’re not a geneticist.” 

Kirby’s eyes still ,did not seem 
truly to recognize Lou. 

“Do you have any idea of why 
we’re here. Dr. Kirby?” Lou 
asked. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



149 




Kirby shook his head. He 
seemed dazed, out of it. Lou 
looked around the room. The fur- 
nishings were comfortable enough 
— a sofa, two deep contour chairs, 
a bookshelf full of tape spools, a 
viewscreen set into the wall. No 
windows, though. Lou got up and 
went to the door. Locked. 

What could have happened to 
Bonnie? 

The feeling that she, too, was 
somehow involved in what was 
happening nagged him. He turned 
back to Kirby. The older man’s 
face was sunk in his hands. 

“Are you okay?” 

“What? Oh, yes I’m all right. 
Merely . well, frankly, I’m 
frightened.” 

“Of what?” 

Kirby fluttered his hands again. 
“I — I don’t know. I don’t know 
why we’re here, or what they want 
to do with us. That frightens me. 
My whole life is predicated on 
everything’s having a reason. 
They won’t let me call my wife or 
even a lawyer.” 

Lou paced the room. “They 
grabbed me when 1 landed my glid- 
er. My girl was supposed to meet 
me — but she wasn’t there. I don’t 
know what’s happened to her.” He 
moved between door and sofa. 
“I’m worried. We were supposed 
to fly back to Albuquerque to 
night.” 

The door opened. The same two 
men stood in the corridor. 

“You will come with us, please.” 

150 



Kirby started to stand up. But 
Lou said, “No, I won’t. Not until 
you tell us what this is all about. 
You can’t arrest us and push us 
around like this. 1 want some 
talk.” 

The Norseman pulled a needle- 
thin gun from his tunic. It was so 
small that his hand hid all of it ex- 
cept the slim barrel. 

“Please, Mr. Christopher. We 
have no desire to use force. You 
are not technically under ar- 
rest -therefore you have no need 
for a lawyer. However, you are 
wanted for questioning at gov- 
ernment headquarters in Mes- 
sina. It would be best for you to co- 
operate.” 

“Messina? In Sicily?” 

The blond nodded. 

“But — my family — ” Kirby said 
in a shaky voice. 

“They have been informed,” the 
Puerto Rican said. No harm will 
come if you cooperate with us.” 

Lou shrugged, headed into the 
corridor. The Norseman tucked 
his gun back inside his tunic. The 
four men walked slowly toward 
the elevator, their footsteps 
clicking on floors and echoing 
from the walls. When they reached 
the elevator the Puerto Rican 
touched the DOWN button and 
instantly the elevator doors slid 
open. 

The building seemed empty ex- 
cept for Lou, Kirby and their cap- 
tors. 

Lou stepped into the elevator, 
GALAXY 




whirled, grabbed the Puerto Rican 
and hurled him into the Norse- 
man, who still stood in the hall with 
Kirby. They went down in a tan- 
gle of arms and legs, shouting. 
Lou punched the DOOR CLOSE 
button and yelled to Kirby to get 
into the car. 

Kirby stood frozen, his jaw 
hanging open, as the doors started 
to slide shut. The Norseman was 
still on the floor, but he had pushed 
the Puerto Rican off and was 
reaching for his gun. The doors 
shut. Lou pushed the GROUND 
button and the elevator started 
down. He could hear somebody 
pounding on the metal doors at 
the floor above. 

On the ground floor he tried to 
retrace his steps back to the land- 
ing pad outside. He got lost in the 
corridors, finally saw an exit sign 
and banged through the doors. It 
was full night outside, dark and 
damp-cool. The ripe, acrid smell of 
the garbage-choked river was a 
sudden shock to Lou’s senses. The 
city was almost completely dark; 
only a few lights shone, mostly 
high up in skyscrapers where peo- 
ple had their own power gener- 
ators and had barricaded them- 
selves in for the night. 

He heard footsteps and flat- 
tened himself into the deeper 
shadows along the wall. 

The Norseman’s voice reached 
him: “Shall we turn the lights on?” 

“And attract every gang of pack 
rats on the East Side?” the Puerto 
Rican answered. “You don’t know 



this city very well. He’ll never live 
out the night alone. Either he’ll 
come begging at our doors inside 
of an hour or he’ll be dead. No one 
can get through a night on these 
streets alone.” 

“My orders are to bring him to 
Messina unharmed.” said the 
Norseman. 

“You want to search for him? 
Out there? You’ll be killed, too.” 

They said no more. Lou could 
sense the Norseman shaking his 
head, not satisfied, but not will- 
ing to risk his own skin against the 
city streets. Lou heard a door click 
shut. He slid along the wall care- 
fully and found the door he had 
come through. It was locked from 
the inside. 

He turned away and looked at 
the city again with new under- 
standing. He was alone in the city. 

And the night had just begun. 



IV 

H e hunkered down on his 
heels, resting his back against 
the rough wall, and tried to think. 
He remembered school days in 
Maryland, when the best way to 
show you had guts had been to go 
into Baltimore at night. But you 
went always with no less than a 
dozen guys — and you didn’t go far. 
Still, John Milford had been killed 
on one trip — Lou remembered 
stumbling over his friend’s muti- 
lated remains as he had run for his 
car that night. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



151 




Cities were worse now. And this 
was New York. 

If I can get to the jetport in one 
piece, Lou reasoned, / can get 
back to Albuquerque. Maybe 
Bonnie's waiting for me there. 

The old JFK airport was still 
functioning somewhere out on 
Long Island. How to get there was 
the question. 

He heard the distant whisper of a 
turbocar. The sound grew louder. 
He stood up and walked across the 
blacktopped courtyard, heading 
for it. From his left a glimmer of 
light moved toward him. A rail- 
ing bordered the courtyard — be- 
low it, on a sunken roadway, he 
saw the lights on the approaching 
car. The roadbed was patched and 
rough but apparently some cars 
still used it. 

He leaned over the railing and 
tried to signal. The speeding tur- 
bocar roared past, making his 
ears pop, the scream of its engine 
explosively loud between the 
walls of the depressed roadway. 
A puff of hot, grit-laden, kero- 
sene-smelling air blew into his 
face. 

Probably no driver in his right 
mind would stop to pick up a 
stranger in the city. 

He made out a pedestrian 
bridge spanning the road, down at 
the end of the courtyard. He 
trotted to it. A wire screen fence 
blocked access to it. He scrambled 
over it, crossed the bridge and 
found himself on the sidewalk of 



an empty city street. He took 
stock. 

The city around him seemed de- 
serted, lifeless, though people lived 
here by the tens of millions. But 
most were barricaded in for the 
night, terrified of those who 
roamed the dark. 

And the rest? 

Another car raced past below. 
The deafening noise died and a 
new sound came. 

“Coin’ somep’ace?” 

The voice was like a knife 
through him. Lou jerked around, 
startled. A lean youth in rags 
grinned toothily at him. 

Another voice called out from 
the darkness across the street, 
“Whatchagot, Pimple?” 

“Stud in a funny suit 

Three shadows converged on 
Lou and his accoster from across 
the street. Lou stood frozen. 

“Funny suit,” agreed the mid- 
dle one of the newcomers. He was 
also the shortest in the group. All 
wore the hard, hungry look of 
starvation. 

The one in the middle seemed to 
be the leader. He eyed Lou care- 
fully, then asked, “Got a pass?” 

“What?” 

“On Peeler turf you got to have 
a pass to go through.” 

“No.” 

“Humpin’ right you ain’t. No- 
body gets a pass except from me — 
and I don’t give em.” 

All four laughed. 

The leader asked, “How much 
skin on ya?” 



152 



GALAXY 




“I don’t understand.” 

“Skin, leaves, pages, paper, 
bread — ” 

“Oh, you mean money.” Lou 
shook his head. “Nothing. I don’t 
carry — ” 

The small of his back exploded. 
Lou sagged down to his knees, pain 
screaming through him. The lead- 
er stepped up in front of him. Lou 
stared into hard, glittering eyes. 

“I” 

Smiling, the leader rocked back 
deliberately and swung his fist 
into Lou’s mouth. Someone else 
kicked Lou in the chest and he 
toppled over backward, gasping 
for breath. His mouth filled with 
blood. Tiny bright lights flashed 
and swam in his gaze. He could not 
see. 

He felt their hands on him, rip- 
ping his suit. They rolled him face 
down on the filthy sidewalk. They 
pulled off his boots. His mouth was 
numb. His back and ribs flamed 
with pain when he tried to move 
but he forced his breathing back to 
normal, fought his way to a 
crouching position when they re- 
leased him. 

“Honest, stud, aintcha?” the 
leader said, grinning. “No skin, 
lol’ truth. But boots is somethin’ 
ta howl for.” 

Lou stayed in his crouch and 
rubbed at the fast-caking blood on 
his chin. His four captors were 
ranged in a half-circle around him, 
looming over him. 

“Okay,” said the leader. “How 



we gonna get rid of ’im? The same 
way as always?” 

One of the four flicked open a 
knife and started giggling. 

Lou uncoiled from the ground 
and slammed straight into the 
leader, bowling him over. He 
pounded down the darkened 
street, rounded a blind corner. 
Something sharp bit into one 
bare foot but he kept going, heart 
pounding, breath choking him. 
Lou cut to the middle of the street. 
They raced out to meet him. One 
overshot him; the other took a 
kick into the groin and doubled 
up. 

Lou headed for the lights again. 
A knife glittered past his head and 
clattered on the trash-strewn pave- 
ment. Lou’s lungs were in flames, 
his heartbeat a deafening roar in 
his ears. Someone grabbed at his 
waist. Lou spun free, leaned into a 
straight-arm, his whole body be- 
hind it. His attacker dropped. He 
sprinted out into the brightly lit 
avenue. 

“Hold it,” roared the leader. 
“Stop. Don’ cross the line.” 

Lou stood in the middle of the 
broad avenue, chest raw and heav- 
ing, ears bursting with the hot 
drumfire of his pulse, legs shak- 
ing with fatigue. The gang 
bunched together on the sidewalk. 

“Good run, funnyman,” called 
the leader. “Lotsa luck.” 

He raised his hand, laughing. 

Lou saw a knife in that hand, 
saw the hand snap forward, saw 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



153 




the knife fly through the air to- 
ward him. He jumped back, to- 
ward the far side of the street. The 
knife hit point first on the black- 
topped street and stuck there, quiv- 
ering. Now the other boys were 
slowly reaching for their knives, 
getting ready to throw. 

Stumbling, nearly unconscious 
from exertion, Lou backpedalled 
and then turned and staggered to 
the pavement on the ether side of 
the avenue. Back away from the 
lights, into the shadows of a door- 
way. The hunters stood on the op- 
posite sidewalk, laughing expec- 
tantly. 

A pair of hands grabbed Lou’s 
arms. “Whatcha want, pinkey?” 

Lou blacked out. 

“A hunt — a hunt — ” he heard 
someone shouting from behind 
him. 

Other voices shouted up ahead, 
and from a side street too. Lou 
pulled up short. He saw an alley to 
his right. Dead end, most likely. 
He walked slowly and quietly 
past the alley and toward the 
corner of the street up ahead. A 
slow shadow is less visible than a 
fast-moving one. He could feel 
himself trembling. The pain in his 
feet was buried beneath fear. 
From down the street he heard the 
scrabbling sounds of feet coming 
swiftly toward him. 

“Try that alley,’’ somebody 
said, half a block behind him in 
the darkness. 

Lou turned the corner and 



started running again, senses alert. 

He lost track of time. Moments 
blurred into one sustained steady 
effort — time ceased to matter. He 
heard voices from all directions. 
From shadows everywhere. 

Once he tried to get into a build- 
ing but the place was a fortress. An 
electrified door nearly knocked 
him out. 

“Hey, head ’im off. don’ let 
’im get across the avenya--” 

The voice moved. Lou picked up 
the direction and saw a glow of 
light a few blocks ahead. One of 
the main avenues, still lighted? 
Lights meant civilization and 
civilization meant safety. Lou 
started running. 

“Hey, there he goes — get ’im!” 
The same voice, moving to inter- 
cept him. 

Feet sounded behind him. From 
around a corner, two figures ap- 
peared — one probably owner of 
the voice — knives in hand. 

V 

H e awoke under a light, a 
single naked bulb set in a ceil- 
ing. A half-dozen youths stood in a 
loose circle around him. Black 
youths. Another gang. 

He pulled himself up to a sit- 
ting position. Every part of his 
body ached. 

The only furniture in the room 
was an antique wooden school 
desk, battered and carved with 
hundreds of initials. A black man 



154 



GALAXY 




sat at the desk. On the wall behind 
him was an old poster showing a 
huge lion leaping through a ring of 
fire. The top of the poster had 
been ripped away. Lou eould make 
out the words. EST SHOW ON 
EARTH, APRIL 15 TO 29. It 
made no sense to him. 

The black man at the desk was 
immense, the largest human Lou 
had ever seen. He was not fat — he 
was a collection of gigantic 
muscles on a mountainous 
frame. He looked out of propor- 
tion to the rickety desk; he loomed 
over it and Lou. His only visible 
clothing was an open vest. His 
black skin gleamed in the glare of 
the overhead lamp. Hard to tell 
how his age he could have been in 
his early twenties or ten years 
older. 

He was talking to one of the oth- 
ers in the room, ignoring Lou. 

“. only way’s gonna be to 
give ’im back. Otherwise the 
peace between us an’ the Peelers 
gonna get busted wide open.” 

“He’s ours,” the other answered 
hotly. “They lost ’im, we got ’im. 
Makes ’im ours, right?” 

The rest muttered agreement. 

“You want the Peelers up here 
after ’im? Ready to fight the whole 
pack? Tonight? ’Sides, he ain’t got 
nothin’ on ’im, he ain’t worth 
keepin’!” 

Lou realized they were talking 
about him. “Hey, wait a min- 
ute — ” 

“Shuddup, pinkey.” A toe 



nudged his tender back. Lou 
winced and closed his mouth. 

“Naw, wait,” said the giant, 
looking down at Lou. “Know 
where you are, white man?” 

Lou shook his head. 

“You’re in the secret headquar- 
ters of the Top Cats. I am N’Gai 
Felix Leo, president of the Top 
Cats. You may call me Felix for 
short.” Felix spoke slowly and 
carefully, in precise English, for 
Lou. 

“Apparently,” he went on, “you 
stumbled onto our turf when the 
Peelers were chasing you a little 
while ago. We are now discussing 
whether we should give you back 
to the Peelers or deal with you 
ourselves.” 

“Deal with me?” 

“Kill ya,” snapped a tall, lanky 
youth. 

Felix shook his head and grasped 
the edges of the desk in his mas- 
sive hands'. “Zonk, whyn’t you 
keep shut?” he said to the one who 
had spoken. He turned back to 
Lou. “You can’t stay here. You 
can’t join our gang for obvious 
reasons. If we let you go free, the 
Peelers would take it as an un- 
friendly gesture and they might 
start a war with us.” 

“Them whitesheets,” Zonk mut- 
tered. 

“My friends don’t like to admit 
it,” Felix said, his voice rising, 
“but we are in no shape for a war 
against the Peelers. They out- 
number us and they can call in half 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



155 




a dozen other gangs as their allies.” 
“An’ we can get all uptown to 
come on our side,” Zonk shouted. 

“Yeah, an’ turn the whole city 
into a battleground?’’ Felix 
countered. “Been enough o’ that, 
you fool. We gotta work out 
somethin’ better- least till we’re 
strong enough to stand up to the 
Peelers.” 

“Look,” said Lou, “all 1 want is 
to get to the jetport before the po- 
lice block it off.” 

“Police?” Zonk flashed. “Hel- 
mets? After you?” 

“Federal marshals and some 
world government people.” 

They stared at him blankly. 
None of them had the vaguest idea 
of what he was talking about. 

Except Felix. “Why are they af- 
ter you?” 

“They won’t tell me.” 

Zonk laughed. “Since when the 
helmets tell you why they crack- 
in’ your skull? They jus’ do it, 
tha’sall. You find out later in the 
hospital if you make it that far.” 
“If 1 don’t get to the jetport be- 
fore dawn they’ll probably be 
waiting for me there,” Lou said. 

Felix shook his head again. 
“You’re not getting to JFK either 
before dawn or after it. We can’t 
let you go, the Peelers would get 
sore at us.” 

“You’re a kneeler,’’ Zonk 
yelled. “Chicken, scared o’ them 
damn Peelers.” 

Felix’s face went unimaginably 
hard. His eyes slitted like a cat’s. 



He rose from his chair and stepped 
out from behind the desk on legs 
the size of tree trunks. Zonk 
backed away. 

“We been friends,” Felix said as 
he advanced like a tide engulfing 
the room. His voice was low, men- 
acing. “So Fm gonna give you one 
chance to eat that mouth. Now.” 
Zonk said, “I — got sore — ” 

“Am 1 a kneeler?” Felix was 
towering over the lean youth -he 
seemed to surround Zonk. 

“No no, you ain’t.” 

“Am I afraid of anyone or any- 
thing on this earth?” 

“No. Nothin’ or nobody.” 

Lou said, “Then you’re not 
afraid of helping me get to JFK.” 
Everybody froze. The room be- 
came absolutely silent. Felix 
turned toward Lou. The grimy 
floorboards squeaked under him. 
His face was still as flat and hard 
as the face of the lion in the poster. 
“What did you say?” 

“You heard it.” 

Felix stared at Lou for a long 
moment. Then he chuckled. Final- 
ly he laughed. The sound shook the 
room. 

“You’re something, white 
man — really something, calling 
me out like that.” Felix went back 
to the desk. “You got guts. Not 
much brains, rnaybe, but some 
guts.” He dropped back on, the 
chair so hard that Lou felt sure it 
would crack under him. “If I don’t 
take you to JFK it won’t be be- 
cause I’m afraid. Is that it?” 



156 



GALAXY 




Lou grinned. “That’s what I 
said.” 

Felix laughed again. He waved a 
heavy hand. “Man, you must have 
some black blood in you some- 
place. You got guts, all right. 
Look — if I let you go, you’ll be 
dead before daybreak. If 1 keep 
you — or help you — I’ll start a war. 
But maybe you’re worth giving a 
hand to — I’ll tell you about it.” He 
turned to Zonk. “Go get us a car.” 

“You gonna 

“Man wants t’see JFK,” Felix 
said. “1 ain’t seen the place myself 
for years. You ever see it?” 

Zonk, wide-eyed, shook his 
head. 

“You ready to fight a war when 
we get back?” 

Zonk nodded. So did the others. 

“Okay, get a car. Maybe we’ll 
stop uptown on our way back, 
bring reinforcements. Show the 
Peelers they gotta think twice 
’fore they start a war.” 

“Now you’re talkin’,” Zonk said 
and headed for the door. 

T he vehicle was an ancient 
two-door, crumbling with rust, 
dented, upholstery ripped, auto- 
matic guidance long wrecked, 
lights defective, radio gone. But it 
ran. 

Felix was jammed in behind the 
wheel. He laughed softly. “Man, 
some people sure are lucky. You 
got guts all right, but better than 
that, you got luck.” 

Lou looked at him. Somehow, in 



this flat cold gray of early morn- 
ing, Felix seemed different. 

“Still haven’t figured it out, have 
you?” Felix asked him. 

“Right. 1 don’t understand.” 

The big man squirmed around in 
the too-small bucket seat and 
glanced over his shoulder at Zonk, 
who was sound asleep. 

Then he said to Lou, “You think 
you just talked your way out of be- 
ing killed by a teen pack? Just like 
that? Never wondered why the 
Top Cats are led by a guy my age? 
I’m over thirty, you know.” He 
dug into a pocket, handed Lou a 
card. 

Lou glanced at it in the dim pan- 
el light. He read: Office of Reha- 
bilitation-before Felix took 
back the card. 

“All you need to know,” Felix 
said. “We’re here, trying to save 
what we can, and as many young 
people as we can. My gang knows 
me -we sort of trade. I give them 
leadership against the other 
gangs and once in a while they try 
out my ideas for straightening 
them out -T try to bring them 
around to acting a§ hu- 
mans slowly.” He jerked a 
thumb back toward the city. “My 
life’s there. Don’t get me wrong H 
work with these guys and you’re 
lucky to be alive. If you hadn’t said 
what you said — you wouldn’t be. 
But I’ve got to teach my guys there 
are values other than sex and 
wars. You gave me a chance. I fig- 
ure it’ll take another ten-twelve 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



157 




years before the gangs start act- 
ing as civilized as Stone Age 
tribes.” 

“Do they understand why you’re 
helping me?” 

“Right now they understand that 
I’m not afraid of the Peelers. They 
knew it — but confirmation nev- 
er hurts,” Felix said. “As to why 
I’m bringing you here?” He 
shrugged. “It’ll come to them. 
Maybe some suspect even now.” 

“What happens if they decide 
you’re working against them in 
saving my life?” 

“I’ve seen what’s happened to 
others like me — outsiders. It isn’t 
pretty.” 

VI 

T he towers and hangars of JFK 
rose in the pre-dawn glow. Off 
the road, Lou also saw the lights of 
an automated shopping center. 

He said softly to Felix, “There’s 
your reason for bringing me 
here — ” and pointed. 

Felix grinned, swung the car to 
an off-ramp, pulled into the auto- 
mated shopping ce/iter. 

The main doors to the shoppers’ 
mall remained locked until Lou 
told his credit number to the tiny 
receiver beside the door and let 
the camera just, above it take his 
picture. 

“This credit number is from Al- 
buquerque, New Mexico,” the 
shopping center computer said im- 
passively. “It will require several 



minutes to check it through.” 

Felix said, “We’ll wait.” 

Lou wondered if a general alarm 
had been sent out for him — if so, 
his credit number and picture 
would have been pulled out of the 
file. And he might be broadcast- 
ing his whereabouts. 

“Sorry to keep you waiting,” 
the computer said. “Your credit 
check is complete. You may enter 
the center and purchase what- 
ever you wish up to a limit of ten 
thousand dollars.” 

Lelix beamed. “Just what I’ve 
always wanted a man with a 
good credit rating.” 

The mall and shops were de- 
serted as Lou, Felix and Zonk went 
through. Lou limped to a drug- 
store and had his foot treated. Felix 
and Zonk headed straight for the 
clothing shops. In a half hour Lou 
had showered, shaved and dressed 
in a disposable summer suit. 
Felix went in for grander tastes, 
complete with cape and boots. 
Zonk leaned toward electric 
colors and the latest, form-fitted, 
sprayed-on styles. 

Lou said, “Take some loot back 
to the gang.” He looked straight at 
Lelix. “That’s what you two came 
here for.” 

Zonk’s tough face showed sur- 
prise he stared hard at Lou, 
glanced at Lelix and went to work, 
pulling clothing from the racks. 

F elix drove through the main 
streets of JFK just as the sun 



158 



GALAXY 




showed itself over the distant sky- 
line. The white-helmeted security 
guards at the gates eyed the bat- 
tered old car but let it pass. The 
sweeping ramp to the once-grand 
terminal building was potholed, 
the building in decay. 

The car stopped in front of the 
terminal and Lou stepped out. 

Felix patted the boxes in the 
back seat. He said, “Next time we 
catch a white man we know where 
to take him — right, Zonk?” 

He waved at Lou and drove off. 

The first flight that connected 
with Albuquerque was at seven 
and proved uneventful. No one 
stopped or even noticed Lou as he 
went to the flight departure 
lounge, verified his ticket on the 
jet, went aboard and took his seat. 
No alarm seemed to be out for 
him. 

He fell asleep when the plane 
was airborne and awoke with a 
start when the flaps and wheels 
went down again. Through the win- 
dow he could see the familiar flat 
greenery of the New Mexico irri- 
gated farmlands. In the distance 
Sandia peak stuck its rocky brown 
mass into the sky. Instantly he 
thought of Bonnie. 

I wonder ij she’s home. Maybe 
she never left for Charleston. An- 
other thought hit him. What if 
they’re waiting for me when I get 
ojf the plane? 

The plane landed and taxied up 
to the terminal. Lou tried to look 
invisible in the crowd, bolted for 



the nearest exit. Outside in the 
blazing sunlight he wondered if 
his car was still in the parking lot. 
Better leave it alone. He waved a 
cab and told the autodriver, “Ge- 
netics Institute.” 

Bonnie would be at the lab if she 
hadn’t been picked up by the po- 
lice. 

The cab moved into the farm- 
lands, following one of the main 
irrigation lines. For the 
thousandth time, Lou tried to puz- 
zle out why the authorities 
wanted him. The Federal mar- 
shal had said he was under arrest. 
The Norseman at the UN build- 
ing had said he wasn’t. But they 
were going to take him to Mes- 
sina. Why? 

Finally Lou could see the famil- 
iar white buildings of the Institute. 
Something was wrong. The place 
looked deserted. The parking lot 
was empty. Nobody was walking 
around 'Outside. Nobody was visi- 
ble in the big glass-fronted lobby. 
And as the cab pulled up to the 
outer fence, the gate did not slide 
open automatically. 

Lou glanced at his wristwatch — 
nine-thirty, Albuquerque time. 

Why is it — wait a minute. What 
day is it? Sunday or Monday? I 
took off— it must be Sunday, got to 
be. 

He thumbed down the window 
button and felt the heat of the out- 
doors invade the cab. To the gate 
control box he said, “Code one- 
five, Christopher. Open up.” 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



159 




The gate rattled open. The cab 
moved smoothly to the lobby 
door. Just to be safe, Lou gave a 
phony name and credit number to 
the cab's simple-minded com- 
puter. It had no camera equip- 
ment and therefore no way to 
check on who its passenger really 
was. 

T he cab left. Lou stood squint- 
ing in the brilliant sunshine. A 
flash of fear knifed through him. 
Even for a Sunday the Institute 
seemed utterly deserted. 

The main doors into the lobby 
were locked but Eou’s name and 
code symbol were enough to open 
them. He stepped into the cool 
darkness of the lobby; the sun's 
glare was screened out by the pol- 
arized windows. He hesitated, 
then walked the building's main 
corridor. His footsteps against 
the plastic flooring and the whis- 
per of the air conditioning were 
the only sounds he could hear. 

First thing to do is call Bonnie, 
find out if she's okay. 

His office was at the end of the 
corridor, next to Ramo, the big 
computer. Suddenly Lou real- 
ized: Not even Ramo's making 
any noise. Usually the com- 
puter was humming and chatter- 
ing — it was almost always work- 
ing on something, even on week- 
ends and late at night. 

Lou looked through the glass 
partition that surrounded Ramo. 
The computer was silent. No 



light flashed on its main board. 

"Ramo, you awake?” 

Erom the speaker in the ceiling 
came a warm baritone voice. 
“Yes, Lou. Em fine. What can I do 
for you?” A single row of lights 
flickered to life on the main board. 

Lou breathed a relieved sigh. 
“You were so quiet. I thought 
somebody had shut you down.” 

“All programs are completed at 
present," Ramo answered. 

“All programs? What about the 
zygote modeling calculations? 
You still have a month’s work on 
them.” 

“That program was temporarily 
shut down by Dr. Kaufman.” 

“Shut down? Why?” 

“1 don't know.” 

Lou stood watching the flicker- 
ing lights. Something like panic 
was forming in the pit of his stom- 
ach. He fought it down. 

“Okay — uh, get Bonnie Sterne 
on the phone for me, will you? Her 
home phone.” 

“Shall I place the call on your 
office phone?” Ramo asked. 

“No. I’ll be in the cafeteria. 
Anybody been in today?” 

“No one. Except for Big George, 
of course.” 

Shaking his head in puzzlement, 
Lou returned to the main corri- 
dor. He stepped into the cafeteria 
and saw Big George sitting at a 
table eating a huge plate of fruit 
salad. 

Big George was an eight-year- 
old mountain gorilla, taller than 



160 



GALAXY 




Lou even in his hunched-over, 
ground-knuckling posture. No one 
had weighed him for several 
months, not since he had playful- 
ly ripped the big scales out of the 
wall of his special quarters. His 
face was all ferocity — fanged 
mouth, low beetling brow, black 
muzzle and blacker hair. His arms 
dwarfed the table he sat at. The 
plastic chair was sagging danger- 
ously under his weight. It was hard 
to believe that Big George was a 
gentle, even a timid animal. 

“Who let you in here?” Lou 
asked from the doorway. 

“Let myself in. Uncle Lou,” 
George whispered. “Got hungry. 
Nobody here to feed me. Opened 
the pen gate and came for food.” 

Lou went over to the selector 
wall and punched buttons for a 
steak dinner. “You mean no- 
body’s been around to feed you 
since yesterday?” 

“Nobody, Uncle Lou.” George 
stuffed half a cantaloupe into his 
toothy mouth. Big George was one 
of the Institute’s great successes. 
Geneticists had managed to give 
the gorilla a large measure of in- 
telligence. George tested out to 
the intelligence level of a human 
six-year-old. It seemed he would go 
no further. The Institute’s surgi- 
cal team had altered George’s 
vocal equipment so that he could 
speak in a harsh, labored whisper. 

Lou carried his steaming tray to 
the end of George’s table. He was 
glad of some companionship but 



it was best to give George plenty 
of room. George was sloppy. 

Looking up at the ceiling, Lou 
called, “Hey, where’s that phone 
call, Ramo?” 

“There is no answer,” came the 
smooth reply. 

“She’s not home?” 

“Evidently not,” said Ramo. 
“What’s her phone say?” 
“Nothing. No reply whatever. 
No forwarding number, no re- 
quest to leave a message.” 

Lou stared at his steak. Sudden- 
ly he had lost his appetite. 

Got to think — took off Sunday 
morning, didn’t I? Or was it Sat- 
urday? So confusing — the whole 
night in New York. That was just 
last night. .or was it? 

“Ramo, what day is it?” 
“Monday, July seventh.” 

“Then where is everybody?” 

“All of the scientific staff has 
been taken into custody by Fed- 
eral marshals,” Ramo said calm- 
ly. “Everyone else has been sent 
home.” 

Before the words could register 
on Lou’s mind George growled, 
“Somebody coming in the hall- 
way, Uncle Lou. Strangers.” 
“Federal marshals,” Ramo said. 
“1 was programed to call them 
when you returned to the Insti- 
tute.” 

VII 

L OU stood up. “Federal mar- 
shals? How many?” 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



161 




“Twelve. They have locked all 
doors and are searching the build- 
ing for you,” Ramo said without 
emotion. 

“Uncle Lou, I’m afraid,” 
George whispered. He pushed up 
from his chair and shambled over 
to stand beside Lou, so close that 
Lou could feel the warmth from the 
great hairy body. 

“Is the door to the courtyard 
locked?” 

“Yes,” Ramo answered. “All 
the doors are.” 

Footsteps sounded in the hall. 
Lou turned to George. 

“Can you knock that door open, 
Georgy?” 

“I can try. Uncle Lou.” 

Lou patted a massive shoulder. 
“Come on.” 

George scampered tpward the 
door, accidentally knocking a 
chair out of his way. A yell came 
from the hall. 

“Hey — hear that? In here, quick, 
unlock it.” 

George was loping across the 
floor in full stride now, knuckles 
and big splayed feet slapping the 
tiles. Lou had to run to keep up 
with him. George didn’t stop or 
even slow down at the door. He 
simply crashed right through, his 
bulk and speed tearing the lock 
apart and knocking both doors off 
their hinges with shrieks of ripping 
metal. 

Lou was right behind him in the 
sudden glare of sunshine. 

“George — this way.” 



He took the lead through the 
courtyard and the access tunnel 
toward the back lot. Stopping, he 
pointed to the stand of trees be- 
hind the parking area. 

“You get back to your pen.” He 
pointed. “Safest place for you. 
They won’t bother you there.” 

“But Uncle Lou, 1 want to go 
with you,” George argued hoarse- 
ly. “All the nice people went away. 
These new people scare me.” 

Lou took a deep breath and said, 
“They won’t hurt you if you stay in 
the pen. You can’t come with me 
right now. But I’ll come back for 
you.” 

“When?” 

Lou could hear shouts out in the 
courtyard. 

“As soon as 1 can, George.” 

“Promise?” 

“I promise. Now get back to 
your pen and be a good boy. And 
don’t be afraid. They won’t hurt 
you.” 

With a troubled look the gorilla 
moved toward the trees. 

Lou sprinted for the parked cars. 
The lab’s electric wagons were 
lined up in the first row. Their ig- 
nition locks were keyed to a sim- 
ple voice code. He slid in behind 
the wheel of the first one in line. 

“DNA-RNA,” he said as he 
pressed the starter switch. 

The electric motor hummed to 
life. A man in a gray business suit 
ran out to the parking lot. He held 
a gun. Lou grabbed the steering 
wheel, kicked off the brakes and 



162 



GALAXY 




slammed the accelerator to the 
floor. The wagon lurched feebly, 
then started to gain momentum. 
Lou drove straight at the man, who 
jumped aside and fired. Lou swung 
the wagon, cut back for the access 
tunnel, dived through its shadow, 
raced through the courtyard and 
another handful of jumping, 
shouting men, into the front tun- 
nel and out past the main lobby. 

The front gate was rolling shut, 
but Lou knifed the wagon through 
it and sped down the highway in 
the curiously quiet acceleration 
of the electric motor. 

He picked up the car radio mi- 
crophone and called; 

“Ramo, this is Lou Christo- 
pher. Over.” 

“I recognize your voice pattern, 
Lou. Over.” 

“Basic program zero, Ramo. 
Suspend all housekeeping func- 
tions until further notice. Main- 
tenance and repair mode only. 
Execute. Over.” 

“Executed. Over.” 

Lou grinned as he raced down 
the highway, one hand on the 
wheel. “Very good, Ramo. Now 
suspend all communications 
until my voice pattern orders re- 
sumption. Understood? Over.” 
“Understood and prepared to 
execute,” Ramo said tonelessly. 
But somehow Lou felt the com- 
puter didn’t like to shut itself off. 
“Execute. Over.” 

No answer. The computer was 
completely shut down. All the 



doors that were locked would re- 
main locked until some of the In- 
stitute maintenance men could be 
brought to open them manually. 
The front gate would stay locked, 
too, and it was strong enough to 
keep the police cars inside even if 
they tried ramming it. All the 
lights, the air conditioning, ev- 
erything, was off. 

Have a pleasant day, all .. 

He eased off the accelerator and 
coasted down the highway at the 
legal maximum speed. No sense in 
being picked up by a traffic pa- 
trol. His insides were fluttering, 
now that he had a little time to 
think. 

How long can I keep running? 
Where to now? Not my apart- 
ment. Ramo said everybody on 
the scientific staff was arrested. 
Did they take Bonnie, too? And 
why, why, for God’s sake? What's 
going on? 

He shook his head. He felt as 
helpless as in a nightmare. 
Reality seemed far away. Au- 
thorities didn’t just march into a 
lab and arrest everybody. Not 
today. Summary arrests be- 
longed to the dark ages. People 
had rights, were protected by laws. 

And then he remembered New 
York and realized that in some 
places the dark ages still existed. 



A S HE drove toward town he 
switched on the radio and dialed 
police frequency. Plenty of chatter. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



163 




but nothing about the Institute or 
himself. 

Why not? Why aren’t they call- 
ing for help? Or at least spreading 
an alert to pick me up? 

As if in answer he saw a high- 
way patrol cruiser gliding behind 
him in the outside lane. He knew 
the the electric wagon could never 
outspeed a cruiser; the turbine- 
driven police car could lift itself 
off the ground and literally fly on 
an air cushion for short distances, 
doing several hundred knots. 
But the cruiser zipped right past 
him. The two white-helmeted of- 
ficers with in it never even looked 
at him. 

He drove the wagon halfway 
across town, parked it in a public 
garage, took an auto cab back to 
Bonnie’s. He gave the cab anoth- 
er false name and credit number. 

In the lobby of the apartment 
building he told the door com- 
puter, “I’m a friend of Miss 
Sterne’s, apartment twenty-seven 
T .” 

“Name, please,’’ the computer’s 
flat voice replied. 

“Roy Kendall,” Lou lied, nam- 
ing a mutual friend who lived in 
Denver. 

“Miss Sterne is not in at pres- 
ent. I am not programed to admit 
anyone.” 

“Miss Sterne has left special in- 
structions under code V for vis- 
itors.” 

The computer hummed to itself 
for a second. Then, “Mr. Ken- 



dall, you may be admitted.” The 
door clicked open. Lou stepped 
through and went to the elevator. 

He had to go through the same 
routine with the lock computer at 
Bonnie’s door, but here the code 
symbol was SF for special 
friends. Finally the door popped 
open and Lou stepped into Bon- 
nie’s apartment. 

Shutting the door carefully be- 
hind him, he looked over the single 
room. Nothing seemed disturbed 
or moved. The closet next to the 
foldaway bed was open and some 
clothes were draped on a chair 
before it. Lou poked into the 
kitchen alcove and found a pot of 
coffee still plugged in and warm. 

Bonnie wai here this morning. 
Or at least, somebody was . 

He took a bottle of milk from 
the refrigerator and downed half 
of it. While he was putting it back, 
the front door opened. 

Bonnie stood in the doorway, 
open-mouthed with surprise. 

“Lou!” 

She ran to him, threw herself 
into his arms. She felt warm and 
soft and safe. 

“Baby, is it ever good to see 
you,” he murmured into her ear. 
“You even smell great.” 

“Lou, what happened to you? 
Where’ve you been? We 
heard- oh, Lou, your face!” She 
reached up and touched his swol- 
len jaw. Her fingers hurt but Lou 
didn’t mind at all. 

“It’s a long story,” he said, still 



164 



GALAXY 




holding her tightly. “For a while, 
there, I didn’t think I’d ever see 
you again.” 

He kissed her and she gently 
pulled away. For the first time, 
Lou noticed that her face looked 
tired, strained. 

“What’s been going on?” he 
asked. “Why has the Institute 
been closed? Ramo said — ” 

“You’ve been at the Institute?” 
She looked startled. 

Lou nodded. “Yep. Nearly got 
caught by a squad of guys who 
claimed to be Federal marshals.” 
“They were marshals,” Bonnie 
said. 

“But what’s this all about?” 
Bonnie walked to the sofa under 
the windows on the other side of 
the room. Lou followed her. She 
sat down. 

She told him, “The first hint I 
had about trouble came yester- 
day, right after you took off. A 
Federal marshal stopped me at 
the jetport. I was on my way to 
meet you when you landed in 
Charleston. He wouldn’t let me on 
the jet. I had to go to the Federal 
courthouse. Practically every- 
body in the Institute was there.” 
Lou sank down to the sofa. 

“Any explanations?” 

She shook her head. 

“They let some of us out after a 
few hours. But we were told not to 
go back to the Institute. That it 
had been closed down.” 

“Closed?” 

“Permanently, they said. I had 



to report to the employment cen- 
ter this morning. That’s where I’ve 
been all day. Lou, what are they 
doing?” Her voice was starting to 
rise, her tiny fists were clenched. 
“Why did they close the Insti- 
tute? What is it? What?” 

He took her by the shoulders. 
“Hey, ease off. You’re okay. 
That’s what counts. And nobody’s 
going to hurt you. That’s a 
promise.” 

“But they had rounded up every- 
body — Dr. Kaufman, Greg Bel- 
sen, and Just about all the 
scientists. All the technicians, all 
the secretaries and clerks — every- 
body. And nobody seemed to 
know anything. Any reason why. 
They were just following or- 
ders.” She reached out and touched 
his jaw again. “But what hap- 
pened to you? I heard one of the 
marshals say in the courthouse 
that you had been arrested in 
Charleston.” 

“I got away.’’ Lou told her 
about his night in New York and 
this morning’s visit to the de- 
serted Institute. 

“What are you going to do 
now?” Bonnie asked. 

“I don’t know,” he admitted. 
“I’m about ready to cave in. Only 
had a couple of hours’ sleep on the 
jet—” 

Bonnie stood up. “I’ll fix you 
some lunch and then you can take a 
nap.” 

She went to the kitchen alcove 
and started touching buttons on 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



165 




the control keyboard. Lou 
slouched on the sofa, already half 
asleep. 

“Lou — it’s like the world’s com- 
ing apart, isn’t it?” 

He looked at her. “Whatever it 
is, it’s bigger than the Institute. 
They had Kirby from Columbia at 
the UN building. They were go- 
ing to take us to Messina.” 

“The world capital?” 

Lou nodded. “I guess the world 
government’s behind this. They 
have the Federal people here on 
their side. And nobody’s talking.” 

Bonnie took a pair of steaming 
trays from the cooker and placed 
them on the low table next to the 
sofa. She sat on the floor, next to 
Lou’s feet. 

“Lou — if the world govern- 
ment is after you there’s no place 
for you to hide.” 

“Maybe,” he muttered, leaning 
over the trays and picking up a 
fork. 

Bonnie said, very softly, “May- 
be the only thing you can do is give 
yourself up. After all, if the world 
government wants you the rea- 
son must be terribly important, 
whatever it is.” 

“But why yank us in like crim- 
inals? They’re sure not giving us 
any chance to exercise our con- 
stitutional rights.” 

Bonnie didn’t answer. 

They ate in silence. Afterward 
Lou stretched out on the sofa for a 
nap. He dreamed of being chased 
through the streets of New York by 



ragged gangs and uniformed po- 
licemen. Somehow the streets be- 
came Messina but the gangs still 
pursued him. And from a balcony 
above him Felix leaned heavily on 
a frail railing, huge and black, 
booming laughter at the chase. 

He woke up shouting. Bonnie 
was beside him, her hands on him, 
stroking him. He sat up. 

“They — I — ” 

She said soothingly, “You were 
dreaming. Look, you’re in a cold 
sweat.” 

Lou ran a hand over his eyes. 

“Bonnie — ” 

She looked away from him and 
said, “Lou, while you were sleep- 
ing I was thinking hard about this 
whole thing. You can’t run away 
forever. You were lucky to get 
away last night without being 
killed. Sooner or later either they’ll 
catch you or you’ll be hurt. Badly.” 

“I guess so. But what else?” 

Bonnie’s hands were white- 
knuckled and clenched. Her face 
was bleak. 

“Lou,” she said, “I don’t want 
you hurt. I . while you were 
asleep I called the courthouse. 
There are four marshals outside 
in the hall. They’ve come for you.” 

“You what'V' Lou sprang from 
the sofa. 

“There’s no other way out of 
here,” she said. Tears were in her 
eyes. “Please, Lou — let them take 
you in. They promised you 
wouldn’t be hurt. Please — ” 

Lou stared at her. “Federal mar- 



166 



GALAXY 




shals, the world government, the 
Institute closed — and now even 
you, even you, Bonnie. Nobody is 
on my side. Nobody. In the whole 
world.” 

“Lou, please — ” She was crying 
now. 

The door opened and they 
walked in. Four of them. Big- 
shouldered, tight-lipped. Wearing 
plain dark business shorts and 
tunics. Armed, everybody knew, 
with needle guns and more. 

“Louis Christopher. I have a 
Federal warrant for your arrest.” 

“Nobody in the whole stupid 
world," Lou muttered loudly 
enough for only Bonnie to hear. 

VIII 

I N A way he was glad that his 
running was over. He remem- 
bered a time when he had had an 
inflamed appendix but hadn’t 
known it. For weeks he had nursed 
the sullen pain in his abdomen, 
had worried over it but had told no 
one, until he nearly collapsed at 
the Institute and some of the oth- 
er computer engineers physical- 
ly dragged him to the clinic. From 
then on he had stopped worrying. 
The doctors had made the deci- 
sions and had done his worrying 
for him. 

Now, surrounded by Federal 
marshals, Lou sat in the back of a 
car, knowing that his decisions 
had no relevance. He was far from 
happy but for the time being. He 



was as helpless to change his situa- 
tion as he had been in the hospital. 

They drove to the airport, past 
the terminal building, toward a 
sleek white twin-engine executive 
jet parked well away from all the 
hangars and commercial planes. 
The sky-blue insignia of the world 
government was painted on its 
tail. Standing beside the plane, 
next to the open hatch, was the 
Norseman who had been at the 
UN building. 

He looked Lou over carefully as 
Federal marshals brought him to 
the plane. 

“I see you made it to New York 
and then some,” said the Norse- 
man. “Congratulations. We were 
afraid you’d be killed.” 

Lou said nothing. 

“Please, Mr. Christopher, my 
job is to bring you safely to Mes- 
sina. No more adventures, eh? 
We’ll only have to pick you up 
again.” 

He gestured toward the hatch. 
Lou climbed into the plane. The 
Norseman followed him, locked 
the hatch shut, went forward into 
the control compartment. The 
jet was luxuriously furnished 
with deep swivel seats at the four 
forward windows. Behind them 
were a couch and a full-sized desk, 
complete with viewphones. 

The Norseman returned from 
the control compatment. 

“Pick any chair you like. This 
flight is exclusively for you.” 

Within minutes they were air- 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



167 




borne and streaking supersonical- 
ly across the country. They landed 
briefly at New Washington for 
fuel, then headed across the At- 
lantic, the setting sun at their 
back. Lou slept as the plane sped 
into the gathering night. 

T he Norseman woke him when 
they were ready to land. The 
night outside was black and moon- 
less the only lights below them 
outlined a landing strip. On the 
ground, Lou was taken to a wait- 
ing car and driven from the air- 
field. The Norseman sat silently 
beside him while two swarthy men 
spoke Italian to each other in the 
front seat. The car’s headlights 
gave Lou an impression of hills 
and farmlands and wind-tossed 
trees swaying in the darkness. 
The night air was warm and had 
that special softness that comes 
from the nearness of sea. 

Before long he saw a gateway 
flanked by two live guards. After a 
few more minutes the car pulled 
into a driveway that rose toward 
an ornately decorated entrance. 
Antique lanterns slowed under a 
lofty awning. 

In the darkness the building gave 
the impression of rambling huge 

ly- 

The Norseman stepped out first. 
He held the car door open until 
Lou was also out. A loud mono- 
tone sighing came to them from a 
distance — the sea rolling and re- 
treating on a beach. 



“This will be your home for the 
time being,” the Norseman said. 
“1 believe you'll find many of your 
friends inside." 

Lou walked to the door, which 
opened at his touch. When he 
looked back, saw the Norseman 
was smiling and nodding at him. 

“Your job’s done now, is that 
it?” 

“Yes,” he answered. “You were 
the last one on the list.” 

What list? Lou wanted to ask but 
he knew he would have no answer. 
He stepped into the entryway of 
the villa and the door swung shut 
behind him. He guessed it would 
lock automatically. He didn’t 
bother to test it. 

He stood alone in a wide, long 
hall. At the far end a melodramatic 
staircase made a curve to the next 
floor. The doors on each side of the 
hall were heavy and made of real 
wood. The walls were lined with 
paintings. Portraits, mostly. Old 
and original. A stately grand- 
father’s clock chimed once at 
the foot of the stairs. It was morn- 
ing. 

Lou walked slowly, his footsteps 
echoing on the intricate geometry 
of the parqueted floor. No other 
sound — no, wait. Voices, muted, 
from behind a door. He walked 
over and opened it. 

Seven men were sitting around a 
table in the middle of the room. 
Books lined the walls. A pair of 
French doors stood open at the far 
end of the room. Their filmy cur- 



168 



GALAXY 




tains billowed softly in the breeze 
from the sea. The room was lit 
dimly. Most of the men at the 
table had their backs to the door 
and to Lou. Qne of them looked 
up. 

“Lou. They dragged you in fi- 
nally.” 

The speaker was Greg Belsen, 
one of the bright, aggressive, 
young biochemists from the In- 
stitute. 

The others turned to face him. 
All were from the Institute; Ron 
Kurtz, Charles Sutherland, Jesse 
Maggio, Bob Richardson. And at 
the head of the table sat Dr. Ad- 
rian Kaufman, director of the 
Institute. Dr. Kaufman was a 
handsome, vigorous man, with 
strong leonine features topped by 
thick gray hair. Right now he 
looked weary and unsure of him- 
self. 

“Christopher,” said Dr. Kauf- 
man, frowning slightly. “What on 
earth are you doing here?” 

Lou laughed. “It wasn’t my idea 
to come, believe me.” He walked 
to the table. There were no more 
chairs in the room, so he remained 
standing. 

“Why did they bring you?” Dr. 
Kurtz asked. He was about Lou's 
age but his bushy brown beard 
made him seem older. “So far the 
only people here are the scien- 
tists.” 

By scientists, Lou understood, 
Kurtz meant geneticists and bio- 
chemists. 



“That’s right,” Dr. Maggio 
agreed. “Only the technical staff 
has been brought here. They let the 
secretaries and others go free.” 

“I am on the technical staff,” 
Lou reminded them. 

“But as a computer engineer, not 
a geneticist,” said Dr. Kurtz. 

“Or biochemist,” added Dr. 
Richardson, a biochemist. 

“Maybe the people who ar- 
rested us don’t know the dif- 
ference between computer engi- 
neers and geneticists,” Lou said, 
recognizing the anger that sim- 
mered inside him. “Maybe they 
had orders to bring in the whole 
technical staff. They sure didn’t 
stop and ask to see my diploma.” 
“Well, ” Greg Belsen said, “there 
goes the neighborhood. If they 
start letting computer people in, 
God knows what’ll happen next.” 

T he others laughed. Lou real- 
ized that Greg was trying to 
smooth over the rift between the 
scientists and himself. The caste 
system fostered old wounds. 
Under ordinary circumstances at 
the Institute, caste hardly ever 
became noticeable. But here, in 
this strange place, it surfaced im- 
mediately. And it hurt. 

Dr. Richardson changed the sub- 
ject. “Does anyone have any idea 
why we’re here?” 

“You used the word “arrest- 
ed,’ ” Dr. Kaufman said to Lou. 
“As far as I know, no one has ar- 
rested us. We’ve been brought here 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



169 




against our will, true enough. But 
no one has charged us with a 
crime.” 

“More like being kidnaped.” 

“I was arrested by Federal mar- 
shals,” Lou said. “No charges — 
but they were ready to shoot if I 
tried to get away. And the Insti- 
tute’s been closed permanently, I 
found out.” 

“Permanently?” The word went 
around the table like a shock wave. 

“I don’t get it,” Dr. Maggio 
said, frowning. “Who’s doing this? 
And why?” 

“Obviously we’ve attracted 
attention from the world govern- 
ment,” Richardson said. 

“But why?” 

“Because they’re frightened out 
of their wits over genetic engi- 
neering. They’re afraid of what 
might happen when we succeed.” 

“I don’t believe that.” 

“No? Take a look around you.” 
Greg Belsen said, “The real 
question is, what are we going to 
do about it?” 

“What can we do?” 

Looking down at the polished 
table top. Dr. Kurtz mumbled in 
his beard, “Try to get out. Es- 
cape.” 

“How?” Sutherland asked. 
“Where to?” 

Lou said, “They chased me 
across the country and back. The 
world government may be doing 
this but they had plenty of Feder- 
al marshals helping them.” 

Dr. Kaufman folded his hands 



over his midsection. “We’re sev- 
eral thousand miles from home, 
on an island where we’d be very 
quickly spotted as strangers. 
Even if we escaped from this villa 
we wouldn’t go very far.” 

Lou had a sudden thought. 
“Maybe we don’t have to go far. 
Just to some newsmen. Who- 
ever’s behind this is trying to keep 
it quiet. They didn’t even notify 
the local police when they were 
chasing me. And I didn’t hear a 
word about the Institute’s clos- 
ing on any newscasts.” 

With a sarcastic grin, Suther- 
land answered, “So you volunteer 
to go over the wall and find us a 
newsman. And he’ll tell the world 
we’ve been kidnaped or some- 
thing.” 

“Something like that,” Lou 
snapped. 

“So what?” Sutherland replied. 
“Suppose the newsman believes 
you. Even suppose, he manages 
to broadcast the story and the 
world government officials say 
that he’s wrong, he’s sensation- 
mongering. They say that we’re a 
small group of scientists who’ve 
been brought here for a special 
project. End of story. The world 
doesn’t care about twenty-five 
scientists. We’re not news. We’re 
not important people — like Tri- 
V stars or soccer players.” 

“Now wait, Charles,” Dr. Kauf- 
man said, his eyes brightening. 
“Christopher may have some- 
thing. After all, they have tried to 



170 



GALAXY 




do this quickly and quietly. 
Maybe some publicity would 
break up this whole affair.” 

Sutherland made a sour face. 
“Look at it objectively. We’re 
just a handful of scientists — ” 

“Oh,” Lou remembered. “They 
took Dr. Kirby too.” 

“Kirby? From Columbia?” 
“They had him in New York but 
were bringing him here.” 

“But he’s not in this villa.” 
Sutherland waved a finger at 
them. “You see? There’s more to it 
than just us. I thought so. We’re 
only a part of a bigger picture. 
And the world government is be- 
hind whatever this is. Publicity 
isn’t going to hurt them. Either 
they’ll clamp down on any news 
about us or they’ve already figured 
out what to tell the newsmen.” 
“Then what can we do?” Kauf- 
man demanded. 

“Nothing at all.” Sutherland 
shrugged. “We wait and see what 
happens.” 

Dr. Richardson suddenly 
asked, “Say, what about Big 
George? Is he — ” 

“I saw him this morning — yes- 
terday, that is,” Lou said. “He was 
scared, but I guess somebody’s 
taking care of him. I hope.” 

“They can’t stick him in a zoo.” 
Greg said. “He’ll die of loneli- 
ness.” 

“Or fright.” 

“Maybe we can ask — ” 

The door from the hall opened 
and Lou turned to see Mrs. Kauf- 



man standing there, her portly 
frame tightly wrapped in a night- 
robe. 

“1 finally got the children to 
sleep,” she said to her husband. 
“Are you coming up soon?” 

With a sigh. Dr. Kaufman an- 
swered, “In a few minutes, dear.” 
She nodded and shut the door. 
Lou stood open-mouthed. 

Gred said, “Didn’t you know? 
The wives and children were 
brought here too. For every maro 
ried member of the staff it’s a fam- 
ily affair.” 

IX 

REG let Lou bunk with him in 
a spaeious bedroom on the top 
floor of the villa. They left the air- 
conditioning off and the balcony 
doors open. The murmur of the 
surf quickly lulled them to sleep. 

The morning was bright and 
cloudless. Lou found some clothes 
in the bedroom closet that fit him: 
a gaudy disposable shirt and a 
pair of shorts. 

“There’s a Sicilian house staff 
that will bring you more clothes. 
All you have to do is ask,” Greg 
told him as they went downstairs. 
“And, man, can they cook! We 
may not know why we’re here — but 
they’re sure treating us right.” 

The morning was spent exchang- 
ing rumors. They were being 
drafted by the world government 
for some ultra-secret project. No, a 
war was brewing between the 




EXILED FROM EARTH 



171 




United States and China and the 
world government was pulling 
out the top scientists on both sides 
to save them from being killed. 
Nonsense, war is impossible 
with all nations disarmed; the 
world government wouldn’t al- 
low a war to break out. The real 
story is that there’s an epidemic of 
unknown origin at the Mars base 
and we’re going to be sent there to 
find a cure before it wipes out 
everybody on Mars. Nuts! My 
brother-in-law’s at Mars base and 1 
just got a lasergram from him last 
week. 

The rumors and speculations 
spiraled hotter and wilder as the 
sun climbed through the morning 
sky. But nobody mentioned the 
simplest explanations: that the 
government had decided to pre- 
vent the work on genetic engi- 
neering from being completed. 
That thought was too close to 
home, too plainly possible and 
painful to be mentioned. 

Shortly before noon Lou was 
prowling the patio that faced the 
sea. Several of the older men and 
their wives were sunning them- 
selves. Lou found himself unable 
to sit still. There had to be some- 
thing he could do — something. 

Greg came trotting up the stone 
stairway from the beach below. 

“There you are,” he said to Lou. 
“Listen, I’ve been exploring. At 
the foot of this picturesque cliff is 
a picturesque shore. Some of the 
younger wives and older daugh- 



ters have found some picturesque 
swimsuits. Beautiful scenery. In- 
cluding the boss’ oldest daugh- 
ter. How about it?” 

The memory of Bonnie stabbed 
into Lou’s mind. “No, thanks. I 
don’t feel like it.” 

Greg shrugged. “Okay, suit 
yourself. I’ll be down there chas- 
ing- uh — the waves. If anybody's 
looking for me.” 

“Sure.” Lou turned and resumed 
his patio prowling. He found him- 
self thinking of Bonnie. 

I ought to try to get in touch with 
her. Tell her Tm not sore at her . 

He went indoors to look for one 
of the housekeeping staff. In- 
stead he found Kaufman and 
Sutherland. 

“Have you seen Greg Belsen?” 
Kaufman asked. “We’ve just been 
told of a meeting at which we’re to 
be given an explanations. They 
want three of us to hear matters at 
first hand. Where is Greg?” 

Lou was about to answer when 
he remembered that Kaufman’s 
daughter was on the beach. 
“Greg’s — uh he was here a while 
ago. I don’t know where he is now.” 
Sutherland made a sour face. 
“The car’s right outside, they want 
us now.” 

“I’ll go,” Lou heard himself 
say. 

“You?” 

“I’ll sit in for Greg.” 

“But—” 

“Unless you want to look 
around for somebody else.”

GALAXY 




Kaufman glanced unhappily at 
Sutherland, who was eyeing 
Lou’s vivid shirt and shorts. The 
two older men were in more con- 
servative sports clothes. 

“I could change in two min- 
utes,” Lou offered. 

“No time to change,” Kaufman 
said. “The car’s waiting for us. 
Come on.” 

Lou followed them to the car. 
Two men sat in the front seat, both 
wearing brown uniforms without 
markings of any kind. Both were 
dark, swarthy. And they said noth- 
ing. 

Sutherland frowned in the back 
seat, as the car pulled away from 
the villa. “What do you think we'll 
be told?” 

Dr. Kaufman shook his head. 
“Whatever it is, it will probably 
be more fantastic than any of the 
rumors going around.” 

T he drive took them an hour 
along a winding dusty road 
among hills. Now and then the car 
topped a rise. A view of the sea 
stretched away on one side, rich 
fields of olives and citrus groves on 
the other. 

Thick clouds began to pile up. 
By the time the car entered the 
gates of another old villa, pass- 
ing uniformed guards at atten- 
tion, the darkness overhead was 
grumbling with thunder and flick- 
ering with lightning. The early af- 
ternoon was as dark as evening. 
Dozens of cars were parked 



before the villa’s main entrance. 
And inside, the old house was 
filled with men and women, mill- 
ing around aimlessly, buzzing 
with conversation. 

Lou, Kaufman and Sutherland 
paused inside the front entrance, 
gaping at the unexpected crowd. 

“That’s Margolin, from the 
Paris Academy,” Dr. Kaufman 
said. “What’s he doing here?” 

“And Liu from Tokyo,” Su- 
therland added. 

“Look — Rosenweig — and 
there’s Yossarian.” 

“My God, all the top people in 
the field are here.” 

Lou recognized some of the best- 
known geneticists and biochem- 
ists in the world. He saw no other 
computer engineers. 

“Adrian,” called a frail little 
man with wispy white hair. “1 
knew they would bring you here, 
too.” 

Kaufman turned and recognized 
the old man. At once shocked and 
delighted, he went to him, hands 
outstretched. “Max — they 
brought you in on this?” 

Lou recognized Professor 
DeVreis, the elder statesmen of 
the world’s geneticists, the man 
who had taught the leaders of the 
field, like Kaufman, in their uni- 
versity days. 

Dr. Sutherland joined them. 
Soon the three formed the nucle- 
us of a growing, grave-faced, 
head-shaking crowd. Lou stood 
alone. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



173 




“Do you know any of these peo- 
ple?” 

Lou looked up. A tall, gangly, 
lantern-jawed man his own age 
was standing beside him. The 
other wore a baggy suit with full- 
length trousers and the kind of 
shoes that you only found in north- 
ern hemisphere cities. He was try- 
ing hard to look calm and un- 
frightened. 

“I don’t know many of them 
personally,” Lou answered. But 
he pointed out several of the scien- 
tists. 

His new companion shook his 
head worriedly. “Geneticists? 
Biochemists? Why am I here? Tm 
a nuclear physicist.” He spoke 
with an accent Lou was unable to 
pin down. 

Lou felt equally puzzled. “If it’s 
any consolation. I’m a com- 
puter engineer. Um— my name’s 
Lou Christopher.” 

Lou’s offered handshake was ac- 
cepted. “1 am Anton Kori. From 
the University of Prague.” 

“And I’m with the Watson In- 
stitute of Genetics— or was, that 
is.” 

“American?” 

Lou nodded. He saw that many 
of the people in the crowd had 
drinks and sandwiches in their 
hands. “Looks like refreshments 
are being served somewhere 
around here. Hungry?” 

Kori nodded. “Now that you 
mention it — ” 

They exchanged stories as they 



searched the crowded rooms and fi- 
nally found the buffet table. 

“Nothing like this has happened 
in Czechoslovakia in thirty years,” 
Kori said, reaching for a sandwich. 
“Arrested in the middle of the 
of the night and carried off by the 
police — it’s like stories my grand- 
father used to tell.” Suddenly his 
face brightened. “Ah, there are 
two men I know.” 

Lou followed as Kori rushed to- 
ward a pair of older men who stood 
at the open doors to the garden. 
They were eating and talking qui- 
etly. One of the men was chunky, 
bald, fair-skinned, dressed in shorts 
and pullover. The other looked In- 
dian: dark, slim and intense, 
slightly Oriental. The plain gray 
business suit he wore simply ac- 
centuated his exotic looks. 

“Clark! Janda!” Kori called. 

“Anton,” said the fair man. 
“What on earth are you doing 
here? Or for that matter, what are 
any of us doing here? Do you 
know?” His accent was unmis- 
takably English. 

Kori introduced Lou to Clark 
Frederick and Ramash Janda- 
warlu, rocket engineers. 

“Rocket engineers?” Lou ech- 
oed. 

They nodded. 

“We were working together — by 
fax and phone, mostly,” said 
Frederick, “on an improved fu- 
sion rocket.” 

“For interstellar ships,” Kori 
said. 



174 



GALAXY 




“Interstellar — oh, like the 
probes that were sent out around 
the turn of the century?” 

“Yes, like the probes, only much 
better,” said Jandawarlu in his 
reedy voice. “Rocket engines that 
could propel manned vessels, not 
merely small instrument probes.” 

“Manned ships to the stars?” 

“Yes. It would have been some- 
thing magnificent.” 

Clark said to his coworker, 
“You speak as if it’s all over for 
us.” 

The Indian spread his hands. 
“We are here. We are not work- 
ing. I don’t think they will allow us 
to work.” 

“But who are they?” Kori de- 
manded. 

Lou said, “The world govern- 
ment. For some reason they’ve 
rounded up the world’s top genet- 
icists and biochemists — and ap- 
parently a few rocket people, 
too.” 

“But why?” 

As if in answer, a voice came 
from a hidden loudspeaker: 
“Ladies and gentlemen, if you 
will kindly assemble in the main 
salon, we can begin the meeting.” 

F or an instant the big room was 
completely silent. Then every- 
body started talking and moving 
at once. 

The main salon was not diffi- 
cult to find. It was at the end of the 
front hall, a huge room hung with 
blue-and-gold draperies. Three or- 



nate chandeliers were lit and re- 
flected in a dozen floor-to-ceiling 
mirrors along the walls. The floor 
was polished wood — for dancing, 
but rows of folding chairs were ar- 
ranged across it now. The far end 
of the room was bare except for a 
blank viewscreen on the wall, big 
enough for a public theater. 

When everyone was in the room 
the doors swung shut and clicked-, 
softly. 

Lou sat with Kori, Frederick 
and Janda in one of the rear rows 
of folding chairs. He saw Kauf- 
man and Sutherland in the front 
row, next to Professor DeVreis. 

The big viewscreen began to 
brighten and glow softly. 

A voice said, “Gentlemen, you 
will be addressed by the Honor- 
able Vassily Kobryn, Minister of 
Security.” 

The image of Kobryn’s heavy, 
serious face took shape on the 
screen. 

“Russian,” muttered Kori. 

“Gentlemen,” Kobryn said slow- 
ly, “it is my unhappy duty to ex- 
plain to you why you have been 
taken from your work and your 
homes to this place. Believe me, 
the Council of Ministers has 
thought long and hard before be- 
ginning this drastic action.” 

“As you know,” Kobryn con- 
tinued, his face utterly grave, 
“the government has worked for 
more than thirty years to make this 
planet a peaceful, habitable en- 
vironment. Our efforts have been 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



175 




made extremely diTficult by two 
factors; nationalism and popu- 
lation growth. We believe, how- 
ever, that we have been success- 
ful. There are no more national 
armies and no possibility exists of 
a major war between nations. 
And world population growth has 
leveled off in the past ten years. 
Admittedly, twenty-some bil- 
lions of people is a much higher 
figure than anyone would call op- 
timum but we are managing to 
provide an acceptable environ- 
ment for this population." 

“What about the cities?" some- 
one called out. 

“Quiet!" 

“Let him get to the point." 

Kobryn seemed almost glad of 
the interruption. He answered, 
“Yes, the cities. 1 admit that most 
of the larger cities of the world are 
completely savage — uninhabit- 
able by civilized standards. In 
plain terms, we lost the fight in the 
giant cities; actually, we started 
too late. But we have not given up. 
A considerable portion of our 
work is being devoted to long- 
range programs to win the cities 
back to civilization." 

“Why are we here?" a strong 
voice demanded. 

Kobryn said, “1 am coming to 
that. We live in a world that is dan- 
gerously crowded. 1 am not yet 
ready to say overcrowded, though 
many feel that we have passed the 
point of no return, that our popu- 
lation is too large. They feel that 



the barbarians of the cities will en- 
gulf us all, sooner or later. Even the 
optimists among us agree that 
our present population is large 
enough for us to be constantly on 
the edge of disaster. If crops fail 
anywhere in the world, if a major 
earthquake or storm escapes our 
control — the repercussions could 
be tragic for the whole world. 

“We have eliminated wars and 
prevented large-scale starvation. 
But just barely. We can handle 
twenty billions of popula- 
tion — but only if we keep the 
world-wide society absolutely 
stable." 

Kobryn's voice took on a ring of 
steel at those words. “We must 
have stability. At any price. All 
our computer predictions and all 
our best social planners come to 
the same conclusion; unless we 
have stability, this crowded world 
of ours will crumble into 
chaos — starvation, disease, war, 
barbarism. Without stability we 
will destroy ourselves and poison 
this planet completely." 

For a long, silent moment Ko- 
bryn stared at his audience from 
the viewscreen, letting his words 
sink in. No one spoke. The quiet 
was broken only by somebody's 
cough. 

“The price we must pay for sta- 
bility is progress. You and your 
work are part of that price." 

N OW everyone stirred. A collec- 
tive sigh went through the big 



176 



GALAXY 




room — almost a gasp — more wor- 
ried and afraid than shocked or 
angry. 

Kobryn went on, “Most of you 
are geneticists and biochemists. 
You have proven in recent experi- 
ments that you can alter the ge- 
netic material in a fertilized 
ovum, so that you can control the 
physical and mental character- 
istics of the being that is ulti- 
mately born. Professor DeVreis, 
you yourself told me that within a 
few years, you could produce a su- 
perman.” 

“Yes,” DeVreis agreed in his 
rickety, aged voice. “A super- 
man — or a zombie, a slave with 
bulging muscles and just enough 
intelligence to follow orders.” 

“Just so,” Kobryn said, his face 
expressionless. “In either case, 
the result would be a complete 
shattering of society’s stability. 
We cannot allow this to happen.” 
“Can’t allow ” 

“What does he mean?” 

“You can’t slop knowledge 
“Gentlemen, please.” Kobryn 
raised his voice. “Think a mo- 
ment. No matter how attractive 
the picture you have of raising a 
race of supermen, you must real- 
ize that it will never come to pass. 
Who will be the first superman? 
How will you select? Don’t you 
understand that twenty billions 
of people will bury you in their 
stampede to have their children 
made into godlings? Or worse 
still, they might slaughter the first 



few supermen you produce in an 
insane fit of fear and jealousy.” 

“No, it wouldn’t happen that 
way — ” 

“We wouldn’t let 

“No matter how you look at it, 
any large-scale tampering with 
mankind’s genetic heritage will 
destroy society as we know it. 
Believe me! We have spent a year 
and more examining this ques- 
tion. The best computers and so- 
cial engineers in the world have 
labored on the problem. Our 
world needs stability. Genetic 
engineering is a destabilizing 
element, a wild card that will de- 
stroy society.” 

“But it will create a better soci- 
ety. A world of supermen.” 

Kobryn shook his head. “No. It 
will create chaos. Look at what 
happened in the last century, 
when vast groups of people sud- 
denly became aware that they 
could be free of the social systems 
that had enslaved them. When the 
last vestiges of the European em- 
pires were removed from Asia and 
Africa, when the youth and the 
minorities realized they had po- 
litical power, what happened? 
Was there a peaceful march to- 
ward a happy society? No, noth- 
ing of the sort. There were wars 
and revolutions, riots and assas- 
sinations — it took a century for 
an equilibrium to be reached. 
And for most of that time the 
world population was below five 
billion. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



177 




“Now we have in our grasp this 
possibility of genetic engineer- 
ing, the possibility of making our 
children into godlings or slaves. 
Do you think the people of the 
world will stand patiently in line, 
waiting for you to work your 
miracle for them? Don’t you un- 
derstand that many would-be ty- 
rants would use your knowledge to 
produce the zombies Professor 
DeVreis spoke of? In a world of 
twenty billion persons we would 
never recover from such a violent 
upset to the social order. There 
would be no new equilibri- 
um — only chaos. Our world would 
come crashing down in anarchy 
and rioting. Your laboratories 
would be destroyed, and you your- 
selves would be torn to pieces by 
the mobs.” 

A few half-hearted protests 
came from the audience. 

Finally Kobryn said grimly, 
“The government has decided 
that all research in genetic engi- 
neering must be stopped. We 
brought you here because you are 
leaders in this work. You and your 
colleagues — some two thousand 
scientists, in all — are to be ex- 
iled — ” 

“Exiled!” 

“What?” 

“But you can’t — ” 

“Permanently exiled, together 
with your immediate families, 
aboard an orbital satellite that 
has been set aside especially for 
you.” 



Kaufman was on his feet. “You 
can’t do that. We’re citizens and 
we have constitutional rights.” 

“The world constitution 
specifically gives the Legislative 
Assembly the power to suspend 
constitutional guarantees in 
cases of extreme emergency,’’ 
Kobryn replied. “Last week the 
Assembly voted and approved 
your exile. The World Court has 
reviewed the situation and found 
that we are acting in a perfectly 
legal manner.” 

Kaufman stood tense for a mo- 
ment, hand up as if there were an- 
other point he wanted to make. 
Then, slowly, he crumpled into 
his chair. 

ONE regrets this drastic 
action more than the Coun- 
cil of Ministers,” Kobryn said to 
the silent audience. “You men 
and women represent the world’s 
best scientists. But for the safety 
and stability of the world’s bil- 
lions, a few thousand must be sac- 
rificed. Your living conditions 
aboard the satellite, though rather 
crowded, will be as pleasant and 
even luxurious as they can be 
made. We do not wish to harm 
you. We have tried to find an al- 
ternate solution to the problem. 
There is none. And it is absolute- 
ly imperative that your work in 
genetic engineering is not al- 
lowed to affect mankind. We are 
trying to avert disaster. I hope 
you understand.” 



178 



GALAXY 




“Filthy liar,” Kori muttered. 

Frederick stood up and called 
out, “My name is Clark Fred- 
erick. I’m neither a geneticist 
nor a biochemist, but a rocket 
engineer. A few of my colleagues 
also are here. Are we included in 
this exile? And if so, why?” 

Kobryn glanced away, at some- 
thing or somebody out of camera 
range. Then he looked down, as if 
quickly reading something. 

“Ah. Dr. Frederick, yes. You 
and several other scientists and 
engineers who have been work- 
ing on interstellar rockets are 
also included — I regret to say. It 
was decided that your work — tak- 
en in conjunction with that of the 
geneticists — could also upset the 
stability of society.” 

Frederick’s face turned red with 
anger. “How in blazes can rockets 
to Alpha Centauri or Barnard's 
star upset the social equilibri- 
um on Earth?” 

“Let me explain,” said Kobryn. 
“If the masses of people on Earth 
believed that starships could 
transport them to new worlds, new 
planets of other stars, millions 
would seek out this new frontier. 
As you know full well, only a piti- 
ful handful could ever hope to 
travel in a starship. The project 
is much too expensive — and elab- 
orate — to lead to true coloniza- 
tion — ” 

“Of course. Everyone knows 
that,” Frederick interrupted. 

“No, not everyone. Some selec- 



tive process would have to be 
adopted — not everyone on Earth 
could adapt to life on another 
planet. A caste system would in- 
evitably be created — probably 
the geneticists could help us here 
by creating superior specimens 
to order — ” he smiled with brief 
irony, continued: “The great 
masses of people would expect 
your starships to transport them 
to new worlds where they could be- 
gin new lives, free of Earth. And 
demand genetic assistance for 
those who needed it, or for their 
offspring — the result would be 
protests, riots, uprisings.” Ko- 
bryn shook his head. “We cannot 
permit it. I am truly sorry.” 

Frederick sat down. 

“Besides,” Kori said to him, 
“they get to spend the money we 
were using on themselves.” 

Professor DeVreis was up again. 
“Minister Kobryn, you have sen- 
tenced several thousand men, 
women and children to perma- 
nent exile. We naturally reject 
this decision in its entirety. It is 
completely antithetical to the 
spirit of the world government 
and the liberty of mankind. We 
demand a fair and open hearing 
before the Council of Ministers, 
the Assembly and the World 
Court.” 

Kobryn’s face hardened. His gi- 
ant image loomed over the frail old 
man. “You do not understand. 
The decision has been made. It is 
final. There is no appeal. We will 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



179 




begin transporting you to the or- 
bital station tomorrow.” 

The viewscreen went blank. 

X 

B y mid-afternoon of the next 
day a dozen men and their fami- 
lies had been taken from the villa 
by silent men in unmarked uni- 
forms. The Kaufmans and the 
Sutherlands were the first to go. 

Lou Christopher wandered 
through the villa aimlessly. Every- 
body seemed to be in shock. People 
huddled in small groups — indivi- 
dual families mostly — talking in 
low and frightened tones. Lou felt 
a complete outsider. He had no 
family, not even his girl. 

Again and again a shining black 
minibus would pull up the drive- 
way and two men would get out. 
Unsmilingly they would go 
through the rambling old house 
until they found the person they 
were looking for. A few moments 
of conversation — and a family 
would follow the men to the drive- 
way. Wide-eyed and shaken, they 
would be bundled into the mini- 
bus and taken away. 

Lou stood on the balcony above 
the main entrance and watched 
one of the buses grind away on the 
driveway, swaying topheavily, 
kicking dust as it swung to the 
road and gained speed. There had 
been a shower the evening before, 
but the land was bone-dry again 
this afternoon. The sky above was 



bright but on the sea horizon black 
clouds were building again. 

A sleek little turbocar was com- 
ing toward the villa, top down, two 
men in the front seat. It swung into 
the driveway in a flurry of dust 
and screeching wheels. 

Sitting next to the driver was the 
Norseman. He looked up and 
waved. 

“Very cooperative of you to be 
waiting for us,” he called to Lou. 
“Will you join us, please?” 

Lou had a sense of unutterable 
defeat. It’s my turn now . 

“Mr. Christopher,” the Norse- 
man said, “you won’t try anything 
foolish, I hope.” 

Without a word, Lou went inside 
to find the stairs to the front hall. 
He left the villa blindly. 

The sky was rapidly filling with 
thunderheads. The afternoon sun- 
light had a threatening, electrical 
yellow cast. A damp sweet smell in 
the air portended storm. Sitting in 
the back seat of the convertible 
was cool and exhilarating. The 
wind was clean and strong, tearing 
at hair and clothes. The car soon 
left the dusty coast road for a 
broad plastisteel throughway. 
For many miles the convertible 
was the only car on the road, but 
gradually traffic increased. The 
towers of a city rose among dis- 
tant hills and big trailer trucks 
were streaking toward them on 
air-cushion jets. 

Lou knew better than to ask 
questions. At this speed, conversa- 



180 



GALAXY 




tion between the back and front 
seats was next to impossible any- 
how. He sat and watched the 
clouds cancel out the sunshine. 

Take a good look, he told him- 
self. It's probably the last time 
you’ll ever see any of this — or feel 
any of it .. 

The convertible, still open, 
threaded through a maze of ele- 
vated highways at the city's out- 
skirts and dove into a tunnel as the 
first big drops of rain splattered 
Lou’s bare legs. The tunnel must 
have had acoustic insulation of 
some sort -the roar of the car's 
turbine didn’t echo and thunder as 
it would have in the average tun- 
nel. In an underground garage the 
Norseman left his scat and beck- 
oned Lou to follow. 

He led Lou into the building. 
An elevator waited with its door 
open, at the end of a hallway. 
Lou’s guide was watching him 
warily. He let Lou precede him into 
the elevator. Then he walked in, 
flicked a finger at the top button 
on the control panel. 

On the vertical upward trip, the 
Norseman relaxed somewhat. He 
said to Lou, “1 understand that 
you people are being moved to a 
satellite.” 

“We’re being exiled,” Lou said. 
His anger returned. 

“Yes, so I heard.” 

“For life.” 

The Norseman nodded. 

“Whole families. Several thou- 
sand people.” 



“I know — I’m sorry.” 

“Did you know when you 
brought me here from the States?” 
The Norseman shook his head. 
“Would it have made any dif- 
ference to you if you had known 
what they were going to do with 
us?” 

The Norseman looked at Lou. 
“I was doing my job.” 

“Would it have made any dif- 
ference?” Lou insisted. 

“Well — no, I don’t suppose it 
would have.” 

“Then don’t tell me you’re 
sorry.” 

“But” 

“Stuff it.” 

The elevator stopped and the 
doors slid open. Lou had expected 
a corridor. Instead he stepped 
directly into a huge and 
sumptuous room, furnished with 
thick red carpeting and a long con- 
ference table surrounded by tall 
comfortable chairs in the rich 
brown color of real wood. Two of 
the walls were cream-white, a third 
was splashed with an abstract 
mural. The far end of the room was 
plastiglass but all Lou could see 
through the windows was mist und 
the streak of raindrops. A massive 
desk stood near the windows, its 
black leather swivel chair un- 
occupied at the moment. The air 
was cool and clean. The room 
seemed to smell of authority and 
power. 

“You will wait here,” the Norse- 
man said.

He had not left the elevator. The 
doors slid shut with a soft sigh. 

L OU walked across the big 
room to the windows. His 
steps made no sound on the luxuri- 
ous carpet. The rain was coming 
down so hard now that the city was 
only a blurred gray outline. 

He heard a door open, turned 
and saw a smiling, middle-aged 
man, shorter than himself and 
stocky. The man’s hair was thick 
and dark, although his hairline 
had started to recede. He wore a 
business suit. 

“Mr. Christopher, a pleasure to 
meet you,” he said, gesturing to- 
ward one of the plush chairs by the 
desk. 

He spoke with an accent. Lou 
had the feeling that he had seen 
this man before — on Tri-V news- 
casts, perhaps. 

“My name is Rolf Bernard,” he 
said, taking the chair behind the 
desk. “That probably means noth- 
ing to you. The Finance Ministry 
is often behind the news but seldom 
in it.” 

“Of course,” Lou said. “Tbe 
Minister of Finance.” 

Bernard smiled. “My name reg- 
istered with you? I am flattered.” 
Lou said nothing. 

“Yes. You are wondering why 
you are here. It is very simple. Not 
everyone in the Council of 
Ministers is a monster, Mr. 
Christopher. The decision to exile 



you and your colleagues was not 
unanimous, I assure you.” 

“So?” 

“Mr. Christopher, I will come 
directly to the point. There is noth- 
ing 1 can do to save your friends 
from exile. Even as Minister of 
Finance I am powerless to stop 
this cruel and degrading action.” 
He hesitated, then added; “At this 
time.” 

Lou tensed. “What do you 
mean?” 

“1 am totally against this 
decision to exile the geneticists,” 
Bernard said, his voice firm. “A 
few others on the Council of Minis- 
ters agree with me. We lack suffi- 
cient power to reverse the decision 
of the Council — but we will not sit 
by idly and watch what is being 
done to you and your colleagues 
without taking steps to correct the 
situation.” 

“What steps?” 

“No one is certain of anything 
at this point. Except for this: a few 
of us will work together to free 
your comrades. As for concrete 
action, I am prepared to offer you 
an escape from exile.” 

“Escape?” 

“Reprieve, parole, whatever 
word you wish to use.” 

“Why me?” 

You are neither a geneticist nor 
a biochemist. 1 can take ... eh, 
certain action, that will remove 
your name from the list of those 
to be exiled.” 

“How — ” 



182 



GALAXY 




Bernard stopped him with an up- 
thrust hand. “Never mind now. Be- 
lieve me when 1 say that it can be 
done. You need not be exiled to the 
satellite station. There are a few 
others, also, whom I can slip out of 
the lists and save.” 

“But the geneticists?” 

Shaking his head sadly, 
“Nothing can be done to save them 
at present. Rest assured, they will 
be comfortable enough in the 
satellite. Physically, at least. And 
also be assured that powerful men, 
myself included, will be working 
night and day to rescue them and 
return them to their rightful 
places on Earth.” 

Lou sank back in his chair. 

“All right. What’s the rest?” 
Bernard said, “You realize, of 
course, that although your Insti- 
tute has been permanently closed, 
as have all the leading genetics 
laboratories around the world, 
there are still plenty of geneticists 
and biochemists, plenty of work- 
ing laboratories, left on our 
planet. Only the best people, the 
leaders — the elite — have been 
exiled. In this manner, the govern- 
ment hopes to stifle the progress 
of your science.” 

“In the name of stability.” 

“Yes. So you must understand 
that the government will not allow 
you to begin work at any of the 
genetics laboratories that have 
been left open. If it learns that you 
are working this field, they may 
kill you.” 



“Am I expected to comment?” 
The big smile returned. 
“No — only to hear me out. 1 have 
taken the liberty of starting a small 
genetics laboratory of my 
own — safely tucked away from 
prying eyes. You and several 
others whom I am able to save 
from exile can work there. I will try 
to bring some of the best geneticists 
and biochemists available to 
work with you. They will not be 
leaders of their fields, of course, 
but they will be the best of those 
who have escaped banishment. 
Your work can go on while we try 
to end the exile of your friends.” 
Lou said slowly, “After all that’s 
happened over the past few days 
it’s — well, meeting a sane man in 
the government is a jolt.” 

Bernard laughed. “There are 
many of us. And it is not so much 
that we are sane; we are unafraid. 
Some others on the Council fear 
your science. They seek safety in 
stability and order. I welcome 
change. I welcome your science. 
Without progress the world will 
sink into barbarism.” 

For the first time since he had 
landed his glider, Lou felt himself 
really relaxing. He grinned at 
Bernard. 

“You don’t know how impor- 
tant those words are.” 

“I can guess. I have also taken 
the liberty of bringing some of the 
equipment and animal stock from 
various laboratories to my new 
location. I understand one of 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



183 




your animals is a gorilla that can 
talk. Absolutely marvelous!” 

“Big George,” Lou murmered. 
“He’s all right?” 

“Yes, the gorilla is healthy.” 
Bernard seemed amused, 
“Apparently he was asking for 
you.” 

Lou nodded. “He would be. 1 
promised I’d go back for him.” 
“Did you? Well, you will meet 
him again. “Now, you must realize 
that my laboratory is a private, 
even a secret affair. None of the 
other Ministers knows about it. It’s 
on an island — and once you are 
safely there you will not be allowed 
to leave. Until, that is, the entire 
business of the exile is settled.” 
“But why secret?” Lou asked. 
“Why don’t you tell the world 
about the exile? Why keep every- 
thing hushed up? Why not blow 
this thing wide open and see what 
happens?” 

“My dear young friend, the 
answer to that is not as simple as 
you might think. The stakes we 
play for are high. If we make the 
smallest mistake, we will lose 
everything. You must trust me to 
do what is best. At the proper time 
the world will learn what has 
happened, I assure you. But that 
is time we must gain.” 

“Okay, 1 guess you know more 
about this than I do.” 

“Fine.” Bernard beamed again. 
“Now is there anything you will 
need especially to continue your 
work? We have already dis- 



mantled your computer and are 
bringing it to the new laboratory.” 

“There’s a computer pro- 
gramer — Bonnie Sterne. She — ” 

“You want her at the new 
laboratory?” 

“Yes, but she’s not one of the 
exiles. She’s in Albuquerque. And 
she might not want to come.” 

Bernard waved his objections 
away. “She will come. 1 know 
women a little better than you do. 
If we tell her that you are safe and 
want her to be with you, she will 
come.” 

Lou felt as if his mind were 
somehow stuck in neutral gear as 
he left Bernard’s office. The Norse- 
man met him at the elevator again 
and guided him back to the wait- 
ing car. 

As he sat in the back seat of the 
car, driving through the chilling 
late afternoon rain, he told him- 
self that he should feel happy. At 
least Bernard was on his side, on 
the side of justice and reason. 

Okay, so living on this island will 
be an exile of sorts, too. But at 
least I’ll be working and Bonnie’ll 
be there. What more could / want? 

But Lou didn’t feel happy at all, 
just vaguely uneasy and wary. He 
realized that he didn’t have the 
faintest idea of where the Norse- 
man was taking him. 

XI 

T he laboratory was on a Pacific 
island, Lou guessed from the 



184 



GALAXY 




number of orientals around the 
place. Most of the office people 
were Chinese or Malay. Half the 
computer p^ogramers were Jap- 
anese. 

Lou had been flown in the same 
day he talked to Bernard. Anton 
Kori had been on the plane wih 
him, the only other passenger. 
Most of the trip hud been made at 
night neither Kori nor Lou could 
tell where they had been going, 
except that they had been heading 
roughly southeast when the sun 
had set. The crew two Arahie- 
looking pilots and a black engi- 
neer had not spoken to them. 

Lou and Kori had been 
separated at landing. A Chinese of 
about Lou’s own age had driven 
Lou in an open-topped turbo- 
wagon from the jet landing pad 
along a narrow road that seemed 
to have been cut into a jungle. He 
had pulled up at a plastic prefab 
dormitory building and had 
shown Lou to a room on the 
ground floor. Not much furniture, 
but the bed was comfortable and 
Lou had fallen asleep before he 
had even taken off his shoes. 

Breakfast had been brought to 
him by the same Chinese the next 
morning. 

“The director of the laboratory 
asked me to convey his greetings 
to you,” he had said. “He requests 
that you enjoy yourself this morn- 
ing in any way you desire. He will 
meet you here for lunch. At noon 
precisely.” 



Lou had glanced at his wrist- 
watch. 

“I took the liberty of setting it 
correctly for you.” 

Looking up sharply at him, Lou 
had asked, “While I was asleep?” 

The Chinese had nodded, with 
the faintest trace of a smile on his 
otherwise impassive face. 

Lou spent the morning walking 
around the island. It was small: no 
more than a half-dozen kilometers 
long, and half that wide. It was 
really nothing more than a pair of 
heavily wooded hills poking out of 
the water. The trees were palms 
and other tropical species that Lou 
couldn’t identify. 

The sun was hot but the ocean 
breeze was beautiful. White sand 
beaches ringed the island and a 
coral reef farther out broke the 
surf, leaving a small inlet at one 
end. Lou saw a fair- si zed air 
cushion ship resting in the gentle 
swells of the inlet. There was a 
dock and a few plain white build- 
ings. Slightly away from the build- 
ings was the jet landing pad, an 
adequate strip of well-kept grass. 
The plane was gone now. There 
was no runway for bigger jets any- 
where on the island; the vertical 
landing and takeoff craft were the 
only planes that could come to the 
island and leave. 

The dormitory building was at 
the opposite end of the island, 
connected to the inlet by the single 
road through the trees. In the mid- 
dle of the island, set into the fairly 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



185 




flat area between the two hills, 
were the laboratory buildings. 

The labs were tucked away in the 
shade of tall trees. There were six 
buildings in all, filled with the 
bustling, nearly frantic action of 
men unpacking huge crates of 
equipment and working hard to 
set them up as quickly as possible. 
Their shouting and hammering 
drove Lou away very quickly. He 
only stayed long enough to make 
certain that they weren’t 
damaging the equipment they 
were handling. They weren’t. They 
knew what they were doing. 

And then, as he passed between 
two of the labs, Lou heard a 
scratchy hoarse voice calling, 
“Uncle Lou — ’’ 

He looked up and saw Big 
George standing erect, his huge 
arms upraised so that his hands 
rested on the top of the nine-foot 
wire screen fence that stood be- 
tween them. The fence bulged 
dangerously under his weight. 

“Hey, Georgy!’’ Lou felt his face 
stretch into its biggest smile in 
days as he ran toward the fence. 

The gorilla jumped up and down 
and slapped his sides w'ith excite- 
ment. “Uncle Lou! Uncle Lou!” 

“Georgy, you okay?” Lou asked 
as he reached the fence. 

“Yes, yes. Strangers scared me 
at first, but they are very nice to 
me. It was lonesome, though, 
without you or any of my other 
friends.” 

“Well, I’m here now. Every- 



thing’s going to be okay, Georgy. 
Come on down to that gate over 
there and I’ll get you out of this 
compound.” 

Big George lumbered along the 
fence, knuckles on the ground. Lou 
saw that the gate had no lock on it, 
just a simple latch. He opened it. 

George lurched out and grabbed 
Lou in his immense arms. 

“Hey — careful!” Lou laughed as 
George lifted him off his feet, 
strong enough to crush him, gentle 
enough to handle an equal amount 
of nitroglycerin without danger. 

Lou pounded the gorilla’s hairy 
shoulders happily. The warmth of 
his body, even his scent, carried the 
impression of huge jungle 
strength. And if the gorilla could 
have laughed or even smiled, he 
would have right then. 

A pistol shot cracked nearby. 
Startled, George jerked and nearly 
let Lou fall. Lou saw sudden fear in 
the gorilla’s eyes, then turned to see 
some sort of uniformed guard 
pointing a pistol at them. 

“Stop — put that man down!” 
the guard yelled. 

“Shut up,” Lou snapped. “And 
put that stupid gun away. We’re 
old friends. He’s not hurting me.” 

The guard’s mouth dropped 
open. 

“Let me down,” Lou said softly 
to George. The gorilla stood him 
carefully on his feet. 

Walking to the wide-eyed guard, 
Lou said, “Put that gun away and 
don’t let me catch you doing any- 



186 



GALAXY 




thing that hurts that gorilla or 
frightens him in any way. Do you 
understand?” 

“I — I thought — ” 

“You thought wrong. Big 
George wouldn’t hurt any- 
body — unless they scared him so 
badly that he lashed out in fright.” 

“I was only — ” 

“You were wrong. Now get out 
of here.” 

“Yes, sir.” The guard turned and 
walked away. 

Lou stayed with Big George until 
lunchtime — but inside the relative 
safety of the wire screen that 
marked off the gorilla’s com- 
pound. Too many people out there 
who’ve been frightened by bad 
movies. And too many guns. The 
compound was wide and wild, Lou 
saw. George had plenty of room, 
big trees, a stream, even the slope 
of one of the hills to climb. 

“You’d better stay inside,” Lou 
said as he left the gorilla at the 
gate, “until the people around here 
get to know you better. I wouldn’t 
want you to get into trouble.” 

“I know,” George whispered. 
“I’ll be good.” 

Lou smiled at him. “Sure you 
will. I’ll see you soon.” 

H e walked briskly back to- 
ward his quarters, knowing 
that George would spend the better 
part of the afternoon feeding him- 
self. To keep him satisfied took a 
huge supply of fruits and vege- 
tables. By the time Lou approach- 



ed the white prefab building, he 
felt sweaty and uncomfortable. 
The day was beginning to heat up 
and the breeze had slackened. 

A turbowagon was sitting in 
front of the dorm. Its driver wore 
the same sort of uniform the gun- 
waving guard had worn. The 
driver also was armed. 

In the back seat an older man 
was reading some papers. His face 
was mild and milky white, with a 
high balding forehead and thin 
sandy hair that had started to turn 
gray. 

He looked up as Lou’s sandals 
crunched on the gravel. 

“Ah — Mr. Christopher.” 

Lou nodded and put on a smile 
as he walked up to the wagon. 

“Tm Donald Marcus, the head 
of the laboratory.” Marcus put 
out a hand and Lou shook it. The 
grip was limp, almost slippery. 

“Get in and we’ll go down to the 
lab area. I want you to see the com- 
puter setup before we have lunch.” 
Lou climbed up into the wagon 
and sat beside his new boss. 

“By the way,” Marcus said as 
they drove off, “did you know that 
you’re three minutes late?” 

Without even blinking, Lou 
snapped back, “My guard must 
have set my watch wrong.” 

Marcus looked a little startled 
but said nothing. 

The computer was housed in a 
building of its own to one side of 
the lab complex and not far from 
Big George’s compound. 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



187 




Inside the one-story building 
chaos prevailed. Workmen were 
uncrating bulky consoles, ripping 
off the protective plastic cov- 
erings, leaving huge gobs of spongy 
foam heaped all over the floor. 
Carpenters were putting up 
partitions with drills and power 
saws. Someone was pounding on 
a wall. Everyone was talking, 
calling back and forth, shouting 
orders or responses, mostly in 
singsong Chinese. Lou was nearly 
run down by four men who, with 
backs bent and heads down, were 
wheeling in the massive main 
control desk at breakneck speed 
from the open double doors at one 
end of the building. 

The room was hot and sticky and 
smelled of new plastic and machine 
oil. Lou felt perspiration trickling 
down his body. 

“Most of these components,” 
Marcus yelled over the din, “come 
from your computer system at the 
Genetics Institute.” 

Lou nodded but kept his eyes on 
the nearest workmen, who were 
busily laying a heavy cable across 
the floor. 

“We brought the logic circuits 
and the whole memory bank.” 

“What about the voice circuits 
and input software?” Lou 
shouted. 

Marcus lowered his voice a 
notch. “Um, we didn’t bring the 
voice circuits or the vocal input 
units. You’ll have to type your 
imputs to the computer and get the 



replies on the viewscreen or 
printer, just as with any ordinary 
machine.” 

“Why? How come?” 

Marcus avoided Lou’s eyes. 
“Well, we didn’t have the time or 
the transportation capacity to 
take everything. Besides — ” his 
voice dropped to a whisper — “with 
all these Asians around as work- 
men and technicians, if they heard 
a computer talk they’d probably 
be scared out of their skulls. 
They’d think it was devils or some- 
thing supernatural.” 

Lou stared at him. “You’re 
kidding.” 

Marcus stopped him with an 
upraised hand. “No, I’m serious. 
Sure, we have some good people on 
the technical staff, but the hired 
hands are straight from the hill 
country, believe me. My own 
driver — he’s a great mechanic, 
don’t get me wrong. But he keeps 
some powdered bones in a bag 
around his neck. Claims they keep 
evil spirits away.” 

When they went outside and 
entered the car, Lou took a careful 
look. Sure enough, the driver had a 
thin leather thong around his neck, 
and a tiny bag hung at the end of it. 

They had lunch on the veranda 
of Marcus’ quarters, a house made 
of real stone and wood, with a red 
tile roof that overhung the walls 
by several feet and made welcome 
shade against the heat of the sun. 
The house was atop the hill that 
overlooked the little blue-water in- 



188 



GALAXY 




let, and the breeze from the ocean 
made the veranda pleasant. Lou 
leaned back in a wicker chair, 
watching the moisture beading on 
the outside of his iced drink, 
listening to the songbirds in the 
flowering bushes that surrounded 
the house. 

“A month ago,” Marcus was 
saying, “this was the only house on 
the island. By the end of this week 
we’ll have more than a hundred 
people here - twenty of them 
scientists like yourself.” 

“I’m not a scientist,” Lou said 
automatically. “I’m a computer 
engineer.” 

Marcus smiled wanly. “Yes, I 
know. But anybody who under- 
stands this genetics business looks 
like a scientist to me. I’m a civil 
engineer by training. Right now I 
guess I’m a straw boss.” 

The young Malay driver served 
them lunch on a round bamboo 
table, his little bag of magic dang- 
ling between Lou and Marcus 
whenever he bent over to put 
something on the table. 

“Minister Bernard’s plan,” 
Marcus said as they ate, “is to 
carry on the work that was going 
on at the top genetics labs.” 

Lou shook his head. “Twenty 
men can’t do the work of two thou- 
sand. Especially when those two 
thousand were the best in their 
fields.” 

Marcus chewed thoughtfully. 
He swallowed and said, “1 know it 
won’t be easy. We’ve brought some 



good people here- but you’re per- 
fectly right, they’re not the best. 
And we couldn’t even bring too 
many of them without the govern- 
ment’s catching on to what we’re 
trying to do.” 

“Just what are you trying to 
do?” 

“Exactly what I told you,” 
Marcus said, concentrating his 
gaze on a leaf of .salad that was 
eluding his fork. “We’re going to 
continue the work you were doing 
at the Institute. We’re going to 
complete it and show the world 
that we can alter a human embryo 
deliberately and safely. 

Once we’ve announced that 
news, and told the people that the 
government tried to prevent this 
work from being completed, the 
government will have to relent 
and allow your friends to return to 
their homes and their work.” 

Lou felt an old excitement ting- 
ling through his body. “The next 
step in evolution,” he said softly. 
“Man’s conscious improvement 
of his own mind and body.” 

Marcus leaned back in his chair. 
“It’s criminal,” Lou flared, “for 
the government to stop this work. 
In a generation or two we could be 
turning out people who are physi- 
cally and mentally perfect.” 

Smiling, Marcus said, “Yes, we 
can. And we will, if you can do 
your part in this job. You realize, 
don’t you, that you’re the most 
important human being on 
Earth?” 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



189 




XII 

L ou stared at Marcus, who was 
smiling easily at him. 

“What are you talking about?” 
“It’s very simple,” Marcus ex- 
plained. “All of the world’s top 
geneticists and biochemists have 
been sent into exile. They’re being 
shipped to their satellite prison 
right now. Of all the top men work- 
ing on genetic engineering, you’re 
the only one we’ve been able to 
save.” 

“But—” 

“Oh, we’ve rounded up a few of 
the second-string people and we’ve 
brought in a couple of young pups, 
bright boys, but the ink is still wet 
on their diplomas. You’re the only 
experienced top-flight man we 
have.” 

“But I’m a computer engineer.” 
“Maybe, but your work is the 
key to the whole project. You have 
the computer to handle all the 
thousands of variables involved in 
tinkering with the genes, we don’t 
dare try anything. It would be too 
dangerous.” 

Lou agreed, “Yes — you have to 
have the computer plot out all the 
possible side effects of any change 
you make. Otherwise you 
wouldn’t know for several life-' 
times if you were making the 
zygote better or worse.” 

Marcus said, “And you’re the 
only man who was close enough to 
the geneticists to understand their 
computer coding system. We’ve 



checked all over the world, believe 
me. None of the other labs were as 
close to success as your Institute. 
And none of them had a computer 
system as sophisticated as yours. 
So that makes you the key man. 
The fate of your friends — the fate 
of the whole world — is in your 
hands.” 

Lou said, “Well — it’s really in 
Ramo’s hands. Ramo has the 
whole thing wrapped up in his 
memory banks.” 

Marcus tensed in his chair. “The 
whole thing?” 

Lou nodded. “All 1 have to do is 
run through the programs and de- 
bug them. Then we’ll be ready for 
the first experiments. Take me a 
few weeks at most.” 

“This is critically important to 
us,” Marcus said. “1 don’t want 
you to rush it. I want it done 
right.” 

Feeling a little irritated, Lou 
said, “The programing was all but 
finished when we were inter- 
rupted. In a few weeks we’ll be 
ready.” 

“You’ll be able to scan the 
zygote’s genetic structure, spot 
any defects, plot out the proper 
corrective steps, and predict the 
results?” 

“To twenty decimal places. And 
all done in less than a minute of 
computer time.” 

“If you can do that — ” 

"'When we can do that,” Lou 
corrected, “we’ll be able to mend 
any genetic defects in the zygote 



190 



GALAXY 




and make each embryo genetically 
perfect. Ultimately we’ll be able 
to produce a race of people with 
no physical defects and an intel- 
ligence level well beyond the 
genius class.” 

“Yes,” Marcus said. “Ulti- 
mately.” 

Lou sat back, Marcus smiled 
pleasantly and sipped his drink. 
Presently Lou noticed, through 
the chirping of the songbirds, the 
drone of a jet high overhead. Mar- 
cus heard it loo. He looked up at 
the silvery speck with its pencil- 
thin line of white contrail speeding 
behind it. 

Glancing down at his wrist- 
watch, Marcus said, “That’s our 
next supply shipment. Your pro- 
gramer friend should be on that 
plane.” 

“Bonnie?” 

Marcus grinned at Lou. “1 un- 
derstand she’s a lovely girl.” 

Pushing his chair from the table, 
Lou stood up, “I’ll meet her at the 
landing pad.” 

“Sure, go right ahead. Her quar- 
ters are in the same building as 
yours. She’s on the second floor.” 

“Okay. Fine.” Lou started to- 
ward the front of the house. Sud- 
denly he didn’t want to be 
bothered by Marcus or anyone 
else. He wanted to see Bonnie. 

“I’m afraid the car’s already 
down there,” Marcus said, trailing 
behind Lou. “You’ll have to walk 
it.” 

“That’s okay. See you later.” 



He left Marcus standing in front 
of the house and started down the 
dirt road toward the harbor area. 
Tbe jet sounded closer now. Lou 
could see it circling, still high over 
the sea. 

From behind him he heard the 
whine of another turbo-wagon. 
Turning, he saw Kori jouncing in 
the back seat as the wagon slowly 
worked the rutted road to the har- 
bor. Lou waved and Kori yelled 
for the driver to stop. They 
lurched off together toward the 
landing pad. 

“Going to meet the plane?” Lou 
asked. 

“Yes. They’re bringing some 
equipment for me. And some da- 
ta tapes from Starfarer that came 
in just before 1 was arrested.” 

“The interstellar probe?” 

The road leveled and the car 
picked up speed. A stand of tall 
palms made light and shadows 
flicker across Kori’s face. 

“Yes. If everything happened to 
be working right, these tapes might 
have close-up pictures of Alpha 
Centauri on them.” 

“Really? I didn’t see anything in 
the newscasts about it — ” 

The road wound along the edge 
of the harbor and the driver 
pushed the turbine to top speed. 
There was no other traffic. The 
wind tore at Kori and Lou in the 
back seat. 

“The government kept it quiet,” 
Kori hollered back. “Remember 
what Kobryn said, back in Sicily? 



EXILED FROM EARTH 



191 




Alpha Centauri is a threat to the 
stability of the world.” Kori 
laughed bitterly. 

The car screeched to a halt 
alongside the landing pad. Bil- 
lowing dust enveloped it for a mo- 
ment. Blinking and coughing, the 
two jumped out of the car. 

“Are you going to work on the 
probe data? Is that what Marcus 
wants you to do?” 

Kori made a little shrug. “He 
said I can work on analyzing the 
data. But what he really wants me 
to do is make nuclear explosives 
for him." 

“Explosives? You mean 
bombs?” 

“Nothing so big,” Kori answer- 
ed, grinning. “Little things. Toys, 
really. The kind that engineers 
use on construction jobs. Why, if 
you exploded one of them in a 
city, it would hardly take out a 
building.” 

The plane was circling low, its 
jets roaring. Lou watched as its 
wings spread straight for landing 
and the jet pods swiveled to ver- 
tical. Slowly the plane settled. 

The hatch of the jet popped 
open, and a three-step metal lad- 
der slid to the ground. A broad- 
shouldered young man stepped 
out, turned and reached up to help 
the next passenger. She was Bon- 
nie. 

She was wearing shorts and a 
sleeveless blouse. Her hair was 
pinned up the way she usually 
wore it at work. Her face was ut- 



■ terly serious, perhaps a little 
scared. 

Lou felt something jump inside 
him and then he was running to- 
ward her, calling her name. 

She saw him and smiled. Lou 
ran past the man who had helped 
her down the steps. He wrapped 
her in his arms and swung her off 
her feet. 

“Am 1 glad to see you! You 
came! You did come.” 

She looked surprised and happy 
and worried, all at the same time. 
“Lou- you’re all right? They 
didn’t hurt you?” 

“I’m fine — now that you’re 
here.” 

He took Bonnie’s travelbag 
from the Chinese guard who was 
unloading the baggage and 
started walking her toward the 
car. Kori was still standing beside 
the wagon. 

Lou introduced him. 

Kori said, “Why don’t you two 
drive back to the dormitory? I’m 
sure you’ll want to get unpacked 
and settled in your room. Miss 
Sterne. It’ll be some time before 
all my junk is unloaded from the 
plane. Lou, if you’ll just send the 
car back here-” 

“Fine, I’ll do that.” 

Bonnie was quiet as they drove 
away from the harbor. By the time 
Lou had carried her travelbag to 
the door of her room his joy at 
seeing her had simmered down. 

Something was wrong.
