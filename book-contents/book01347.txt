Forgotten road to success m writing 



By J. D. Ratcliff 

I can’t imagine why more heglnners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I’ve made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I’ve enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on assignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you — but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, I joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at home, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising or Business Writing.) 

You learn to write by writing. Our in- 
structors, themselves all published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print in 
more than 100 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well or offer other 
evidence of writing ability — you may enrolL 
)Iowever, there is no obligation to do so#* 




“Jack” Ratcliff is one of America’s highest paid 
free-lance writers. Although he works only 
four hours a day, he has had hundreds of articles 
published in top magazines, including over 
100 in Reader’s Digest alone.

More Bubbles For Your Bier 



N ext time you drink a glass of 
Coke or beer, consider the bub- 
bles: pure carbon dioxide, and a very 
useful substance. In its proper pro- 
portion in the atmosphere it stimu- 
lates the breathing reflex; frozen, it 
becomes dry ice; gaseous, it not only 
charges carbonated beverages but 
provides the world’s vegetation with 
the raw material for photosynthesis, 
from which they construct them- 
selves. 

But we can have all too much of 
even the best of Good Things, and 
carbon dioxide looks like being too 
much, too soon. 

You know, of course, that pollu- 
tion of the air is a major problem 
all over the world; it rots rubber and 
ancient marble, it dirties clothes and 
walls, it multiplies the rate of respira- 
tory diseases like emphysema and 
lung cancer and it kills people out- 
right — especially babies and invalid 
elders — in cities during heavy smog 
attacks. 

For this reason a lot of places have 
passed laws regulating the permissible 
output of impurities from automobile 
exhausts, factory chimneys, home 
heating systems and so on, and a 
few places have even enforced them. 
With a little luck we can (given the 
will to make the effort) eliminate 
most of the above difficulties by 
eliminating ozone, carbon monoxide, 
aerosols, sulphur and lead compounds 
and a few other poisons from what 
wfe fling into the air every time we 
bum fossil fuel. 



But no one has suggested a way of 
eliminating carbon dioxide from the 
gases of combustion, for two rea- 
sons. The first reason is that no one 
seems particularly worried about 
CO 2 . After all, it’s a Good Thing, 
isn’t it? And the other reason is 
that no one can. You can’t keep 
carbon dioxide out of the exhaust 
of any combustion of fossil fuels; 
that’s the reaction that produces the 
energy. 

But we suggest we start worrying 
about it. We suggest that if we don’t 
do something about it right now, 
we’re going to face a far more hos- 
tile world environment in a few years. 
And we suggest that it may right now 
be too late to worry — because it’s 
probably too late to do anything that 
won’t in itself be reasonably disas- 
trous to our way of life. 

Every time you bum an atom of 
carbon in air you take one molecule 
of oxygen out of the air and replace 
it with one molecule of carbon dio- 
xide. 

To be sure, there are a lot of 
molecules of oxygen in the air — 
somewhere around 70 million tons 
of oxygen for every square mile of 
the Earth’s surface, and the Earth 
has close to 5 billion square miles 
of surface. 

But there’s a lot of fossil fuel, too. 
No one knows exactly how much — 
it depends on how much you want 
to pay for it, basically — but the 
recoverable amount at not much more 
than present costs of production is

In an 

anthropological anthology 
of speculation about 
man's past and future. 



APEMAN, SPACEMAN 
Edited by Leon E. Stover 
and Hariy Harrison 

Most story collections have a con- 
riecting theme, but few have ever 
had one as exciting as this. Using 
the basis of anthropology — the 
study of man — and the skill of 
some of the most prominent 8F 
writers, APEMAN, SPACEMAN 
spans over two million years -- 
from the time man was still swing- 
ing on branches to his first walk 
in space, and beyond. With a fore- 
word by well-known anthropologist 
Carleton S. Coon, and stories by 
such writers as Helnlein and 
Clarke, this is almost required 
reading for SF fans. In fact it fs 
required reading in some college 
anthropology courses! $5.95

something like seven million million 
tons of coal (all grades) and some- 
where aroimd four or five million 
million barrels of oil or its equivalent 
(natural gas, tar sands, oil shde, etc.) 

Suppose we taken all the low-cost 
fossil fuel out of the ground and 
bum it — which is, after all, what 
we are in the process of doing as 
rapidly as we can. What happens to 
the atmosphere? 

As far as oxygen depletion is con- 
cerned, not much, except locally. 
Even now cities like New York and 
Philadelphia have detectably lower 
oxygen partial pressures than the 
“natural” atmosphere. 

But as far as proportion of CO2 
is concerned — ah, that’s different! 
There’s only about three one hun- 
dredths of one per cent of carbon 
dioxide in the air normally. By the 
time we finish burning the com- 
mercially now-available fossil fuels, 
we’ll have almost tripled that — to 
about 0.08% — and that is certainly 
far above the danger point both 
physiologically and in terms of its 
effect on climate. The greenhouse 
effect will warm the Earth rather 
radically; the triggeriijg effect of CO2 
on respiration will have us panting 
for breath, whilev. giving us head- 
aches. 

Of course plants will do their best 
to photosynthesize our problems 
away. But how much can they do? 
In the U.S. alone we pave over a 
million acres of greenery a year; 
worldwide, we destroy an incalculable 
area. Pelagic plants in the sea do the 
major share of the work — but we’re 
shipping plant-killers in tanker lots 
to Vietnam, for instance; and what 



will happen if a couple of those tank 
ships happen to sink, or founder, and 
discharge their contents into the sea? 

Obviously quite a lot will happen. 
But it’s pretty likely that we need not 
consider what will take place if vege- 
tation is depleted; just the burning of 
coal and oU will produce a problem 
big enough to keep us busy. For the 
greenhouse effect is potent medicine. 
Shortwave heat from the sun goes 
through carbon dioxide easily; re- 
flected heat is longer in wavelength, 
and to the long waves carbon dioxide 
is pretty opaque. So we keep the 
heat. Keep enough of it, and the 
polar ice caps begin to melt — no 
one knows, really, at what point it 
happens, or how fast. But happen it 
will, and then good-by to New York 
and all that. Future editorial work 
in the Galaxy publications office will 
have to be carried on in SCUBA 
gear. 

O ne solution, of course, is fewer 
people. Anyone who knows how 
to bring about that state please step 
forward and tells us the secret. 

Another is to give up burning fos- 
sil fuels. Not bad, except that, for 
openers, that probably means giving 
up the automobile. And that strikes 
us as a problem in cultural change 
compared with which taking the life- 
saver away from a drowning man 
would be easy. 

Certainly we can get along with- 
out cars. But equally certainly, we 
don’t intend to. We’U keep them if 
they kill us. 

And you know, they just might.

BULGED* 



by HAL CLEMENT 






used a character quite like Mr. 
Smith. The two distractions were 
closely connected^ even though 
Smith had not removed the nail 
himself. He had merely ordered 
Jones to do it. 

Hoerwitz rather doubted that 
Shakespeare would have been sat- 
isfied with a Smith. The fellow was 
too simple. He knew what he want- 
ed and went after it without know- 
ing or caring what anyone else in 
the picture might care. He was an 
oversized two-year-old. Shakespeare 
would have made him more compli- 
cated and more believable, even 
back in his Henry the Sixth days. 

It was a nice idea, with perhaps 
some scholarly merit. But it didn’t 
really help with the present prob- 
lem. This was more a piece of post- 
Edwardian melodrama than a care- 
fully thought out Shakespearean 
plot. The hero had been trapped by 
armed villains, in a situation 
from which there was no obvious 
escape, and was being forced to help 
them commit grand larceny. 

Of course in a piece of prohibi- 
tion-era fiction he would have re- 
fused steadfastly to help, but Hoer- 
witz was no flapper’s hero. He was 
eighly-one years old and had a 
mass of just one hundred pounds 
distributed along his seventy inch- 
es of height. He could not possi- 
bly have lifted that mass against 
Earth’s gravity. He smiled in spite 
of the pain of his hand y^hen he re- 
called the facial expressions when 



Smith and his three followers had 
first seen him. 

'^hey had gone to a great deal of 
trouble to make their approach 
unobtrusive. They had arrived near 
the apogee point of the station’s 
six-day period instead of making 
the just-after-perigee rendezvous 
which the freighters found more ec- 
onomical. This had served the dou- 
ble purpose of making fairly sure 
there would be no other ships pres- 
ent and of being harder to observe 
from Earth. At one hundred seventy 
thousand miles or so, a one-mile 
asteroid is visible to the naked eye 
and a modest-sized spaceship can be 
seen in a good telescope, but one 
has to be looking for them delib- 
erately. 

It was a rendezvous, of course, 
rather than a landing. The latter 
word means nothing on a celestial 
body where a spacesuited man 
weighs about a quarter of an ounce. 
They had made the rendezvous 
skillfully enough so that Hoerwitz 
had not felt the contact — or at 
least, hadn’t noticed it over the 
sound effects accompanying Ham- 
let’s stepfather’s drinking. There 
had been no trouble about enter- 
ing, since the air lock leading “un- 
derground” or "inside,” whichever 
way one preferred to think of it, 
was plainly visible and easily op- 
erated from frithout. The possibil- 
tity of anyone’s stealing the horse 
from this particular stable had not

occurred seriously to anyone re- 
sponsible for building the place; or 
if it had^ he had attached more 
weight to the likelihood of space 
emergencies which would need fast 
lock action. 

So Mr. Smith and his men had 
entered and drifted down the tun- 
nel to the asteroid’s center not only 
unopposed but completely unno- 
ticed, and Mac Hoerwitz’s first re- 
alization that he was in trouble had 
come after the final peal of ord- 
nance ordered by Fortinbras. 

Then he had turned on the lights 
and found that Hamlet had four 
more spectators, all carr5dng weap- 
ons. He had been rather startled. 

So had the others, very obviously, 
when they had their first good look 
at him. Just what they had expect- 
ed was hard to say, but it must have 
been something capable of more vio- 
lence than the station manager. The 
leader had put away his gun With 
almost an embarrassed air, and the 
others had followed his example. 

“Sorry to surprise you, Mr. 
Hoerwitz,” the intruder had open- 
ed. “That was a very good sheet. 
I’m sorry we missed so much of it. 
Perhaps you’d let me run it again 
some time in the next few days. 

Ti >T ac had been at a. loss to rec- 
oncile the courtesy with the 
armament. 

“If all you want is to see my 
library, the we^ns are a bit un- 
called-for,” he finally got out. “I 



don’t know what else I can offer 
you except accommodation and 
communication facilities. Do you 
have ship trouble? Did I miss a 
distress call? Maybe I do pay too 
much attention to my sheets — ” 
“Not at all. We’d have been very 
disappointed if you had spotted our 
approach, since we made it as un- 
obtrusive as possible. You are also 
wrong about what you can give us. 
Not to waste time, we have a four- 
thousand-ton ship outside which 
we expect to mass up to ten thou- 
sand before we leave, with the aid 
of your Class IV isotopes.” 

“Six thousand tons of nuclear 
fuel? You’ve been expanding your 
consciousness. It would take sixty 
hours or more if I reprogrammed 
every converter in the place — only 
one of them is making Class IV 
now, and the others are all running 
other orders. There’s barely enough 
conversion mass in the place for 
what you want, unless you start 
chipping rock out of the station it- 
self. I’d guess that on normal pri- 
ority you’d get an order like that in 
about a year, counting administra- 
tive time for the initial request.” 
“We’re not requesting. As you 
know perfectly well. You will do 
any programming necessary, with- 
out regard to what is running now, 
and if necessary we will use station 
rock. I would have said you’d chip 
it for us, but I admit there’s a dif- 
ference between the merely ille- 
gal and the impossible. WTiy do

they keep a wreck like you on duty 
out here?” 

Hoerjntz flushed. He was used 
to this attitude from the young and 
heathy, but more accustomed to 
having it masked by some show ef 
courtesy. 

“It^s the only place I can live,” 
he said shortly. ‘‘My heart, mus- 
cles, and bones can’t take normal 
gravity. Most people can’t take 
free fall — or rather, they don’t 
like the consequences of the medi- 
cation needed to take it indefinite- 
ly. That makes no difference to me. 
I don’t care about muscle, and I 
had my family half a century ago. 
This job is good for me, and I’m 
good for it. For that reason, I don’t 
choose to ruin it. I don’t intend 
to do any reprogramming for you, 
and I’d be willing to bet you can’t 
do it yourself.” 

Smith’s gun reappeared, and its 
owner looked at it thoughtfully. The 
old man nodded toward it and went 
on, “That’s an argument, I ad- 
mit. I don’t want to die, but if you 
kill me it certainly won’t get you 
further.” Mac found that he wasn’t 
as brave as his words sounded; 
there was an odd and uncomfort- 
able feeling in his stomach as he 
looked at the weapon. He must 
have covered it well, however, be- 
cause after a moment of thought the 
intruder put the gun away again. 

“You’re quite right,” he said. I 
have no intention of killing you, 
because I do need your help. We’ll 



have to use another method. Mr. 
Jones, please carry out our first 
stage of planned persuasion?” 

II 

F ifteen minutes later Hoerwitz 
was reprogramming the con- 
verters as well as he could with an 
unusable left hand. 

Smith, who had courteously intro- 
duced himself during the procedure, 
had gone to the trouble of making 
sure his victim was right-handed be- 
fore allowing Jones to start work. 
It would, as he said, be a pity to 
slow the station manager down too 
much. The right hand could wait. 

“How about my toes?” Hoer- 
witz had asked sarcastically, not 
yet fully convinced that the affair 
was serious. 

“It seems to have been proved 
that feet have fewer nerves and 
don’t feel pain as intensely,” re- 
plied. Smith. “Of course, the toes 
will still be there if we need them. 
Mr. Jones, start with the left 
hand.” 

Mac had decided almost at once 
that the visitors were sincere, but 
Jones had insisted on finishing his 
job in workmanlike style. Smith 
had supported him. 

“It would be a pity for you to 
get the idea that we weren’t pre- 
pared to finish anything we start- 
ed,” he pointed out. 

As he floated in front of the mon- 
itor panels readjusting potentiome-

IF 




ters and flow-control relays, Hoer- 
yntz thought furiously. He wasn’t 
much worried about his guests ac- 
tually getting away with their stol- 
en fuel; what he was now doing to 
the controls must be showing on re- 
peaters in Elkhart, Fapeette and 
Bombay already. The station was, 
after all, part of a company sup- 
posed to be doing profitable busi- 
ness, and the fact that fusion pow- 
er plants were still forbidden on 
Earth didn’t mean that the com- 
pany wasn’t keeping close track 
of its products. There’d be radioed 
questions in the next few minutes, 
and when they weren’t answered 
satisfactorily ^ere’d be arrange- 
ments to send a ship. Of course, the 
company would wait two or three 
days and make a perigee rendez- 
vous, but if the indicators bothered 
the directors sufficiently they might 
ask a police launch to investigate 
sooner. On the whole, it was un- 
likely that anything would happen 
until shortly after perigee; but 
something would happen to prevent 
the thieves’ escape. 

The trouble seemed to be that 
that something wouldn’t do Mac 
^himself any good. Up to now, genu- 
ine criminals who were willing to 
use actual violence had been strict- 
ly reading material for him; but he 
had done plenty of reading. He had 
a vivid mental picture of the situ- 
ation. The belief that they would 
kill him before leaving was not so 
much insight as it was reflex. 



They might not even wait until 
the job was done. The new program 
was set up for the converters, and 
he would not be essential unless 
something went seriously astray. It 
never did, but he hoped the thieves 
were the sort of people who wor- 
ried about things going wrong. 

He found his stomach reacting 
again when Smith approached him 
after the converters had been re- 
started. The gun was not in sight, 
but Mac knew it was there. For 
that matter, it wasn’t necessary; 
any of the visitors could break 
neck with one hand. However, 
Smith didn’t seem to have violence 
on his mind at the moment. In 
fact, his speech was encouraging. 
He would hardly have bothered to 
give warnings about Hoerwitz’s be- 
havior unless he planned to keep 
the manager around for a while. 



44 A few points you should un- 
derstand, Mr. Hoerwitz,^’ 
the boss-thief explained. “You 
must be supposing that the change 
in converter program will attract, 
or has already attracted, notice at 
home. You are wrong. A mysterious 
ailment has affected the monitor 
computers at the central plant. Sig- 
nals are coming in quite normally 
from the space factories, but they 
are not being analyzed. The en- 
gineers are quite frantic about it. 
They hope to get matters straight- 
ened out ki a few days, but in the

meantime no one is going to worry 
more about one space factory than 
another unless some such tWng as 
a distress message is received, 

‘‘I know you wouldn’t be foolish 
enough to attempt to send such a 
message, since you still have nine 
fingers available for Mr. Jones’s 
attention, but to remove temptation 
Mr. Robinson has disabled your 
station’s radio transmitters. To 
make really sure, he is now taking 
care of those in the spacesuits. We 
realize that a suit radio coidd 
hardly be received, except by the 
wildest luck, at Earth’s present dis- 
tance; but that distance shrinks to 
only about a thousand miles at peri- 
gee, as I recall. 

‘If you do wish to go outside. 



by all means indulge the impulse. I 
might enjoy a walk with you my- 
self. Our ship is a former police 
supply boat, heavily armored and 
solidly locked. One of us has the 
only key — I wouldn’t dream of 
telling you which one. Even if you 
forced your way aboard, which 
seems possible, its transmitter 
channels are not standard. They 
would be received by my friends, 
not yours. You could not take the 
ship away, supposing you are 
enough of a pilot to try it, be- 
cause it is parked beside your waste 
radiators, and the exhaust would 
wreck them — ” 

“You landed beside the radia- 
tors?” For the first time, Mac was 
really alarmed. 



12 



IF 




‘‘Oh, no. We know better than 
that We landed by your airlock 
and carried the ship around to the 
radiators. It weighs only about five 
hundred pounds here. I fear you 
couldn’t carry it away again by 
yourself, and it’s on rough enough 
ground so I don’t think rolling it 
would be practical. 

“So, Mr. Hoerwitz, you may as 
well relax. We’ll appreciate your 
attending to your normal business 
so that our order is ready as soon 
as possible, but if you prefer to 
go out for a walk occasionally we 
don’t really mind. I suppose even 
you could jump off into space, since 
I understand that escape velocity 
here is only about a foot a second, 
and we’d be sorry to lose you that 
way; but it’s entirely up to you. 
You are perfectly free in all mat- 
ters which don’t interfere with our 
order. Personally, if I were you I’d 
go back to quarters and enjoy that 
really excellent sheet library.” 

TToerwritz had gone, but hadn’t 
^ really been able to concentrate 
on The Tempest. Some of Cali- 
ban’s remarks had caught his at- 
tention because they expressed his 
own feelings quite well, and he 
caught himself once or twice wishing 
for a handy Ariel. However, he was 
much too old to spend much men- 
tal effort on wishing, and the only 
spirits available at the station were 
material mechanisms of very re- 
stricted versatility. Worse, he was

probably not completely free to 
command them, unless Smith and 
Company were unbelievably incom- 
petent. 

Of course, if something appear- 
ed to be going wrong, they would 
have to trust him to fix it; maybe 
something could be worked up from 
that side. 

But what could be done, an3rway? 
Just what did he have? The plant 
turned over vast quantities of en- 
ergy, but it certainly wasn’t a magic 
wand It had the complex gear of 
a hydrogen fusion unit, and a mod- 
est tonnage of hydrogen-deuterium 
slush; while it would require deli- 
berate bypassing of a host of safe- 
ty devices to do it, it would be 
quite possible to blow the asteroid 
into a cloud of plasma. This had 
certain disadvantages besides the 
likelihood of blinding the unfortu- 
nates on Earth who happened to 
be looking toward the station at 
the key moment. For one thing, it 
didn’t really deal satisfactorily 
with Smith and his friend. It mere- 
ly promised to dispose of them, and 
the way Mac’s finger felt at the 
moment that wasn’t quite bad 
enough. What else did he have? 

There were a score of converters, 
each designed to take matter and 
transform it, using the energy of 
the fuser, into isotopes which could 
be used on Earth legally and more 
or less safely as power sources. At 
the moment, all were working on 
the Class IV mixtures — the fast- 



yield substances usable for space- 
craft fuel, industrial blasting and 
weaponry, which Smith had! de- 
manded. Whether he and his friends 
planned to use the stuff themselves 
for bank robbery or political subver- 
sion, or merely . feed the black mar- 
ket, Hoerwitz neither knew or great- 
ly cared. A minute charge of any 
Class IV product, assuming that 
he would get hold of it, could cer- 
tainly get him into the thieves’ 
ship, no matter how well she were 
armored. Whether the ship would 
be worth getting into after such 
treatment was debatable. A produc- 
tion controller is one thing and a 
nuclear-explosives expert quite an- 
other. Hoerwitz happened to be the 
first. Trying to abstract explosives 
under the eyes of Smith, Jones and 
Associates seemed not only dan- 
gerous but probably useless. 

There were the radiators, the 
most conspicious part of the plant 
from outside. They were four gigan- 
tic structures, each some five hun- 
dred feet across and nearly as high. 
The outer walls were cylindrical 
and contained high-powered re- 
frigeration circuits; their inner sur- 
faces carried free-election fields 
which rendered them nearly perfect 
reflectors. Inside the cylinders, out 
of contact with their walls, were 
the radiators themselves — huge 
cores of high-conductivity alloy, 
running at a temperature which 
would have evaporated them into 
space in minutes if they had not 



14 



IF 




been held together by fields similar 
to those which restrained the fu- 
sion units. The whole structure was 
designed to get rid of waste ener- 
gy, of course. 

Any serious absorption by the 
planetoid of the flood being radi- 
ated from those units would have 
started a sequence of troubles of 
which the warming of the fusion- 
fuel slush would have been a minor 
preliminary. Secondarily, the units 
were arranged to shine away from 
Earth; their location on the asteroid 
and the latter’s rotation had been 
arranged with this in view. It was 
not a perfect success in one way, 
since the extremely eccentric orbit 
in which the asteroid had been 
placed to facilitate freight-handling 
work produced a longitude libration 
of over a hundred degrees each way; 
but Earth had agreed to put up 
with this. The periodic flashes of 
light from the space factories were 
rather scenic in their way, and 
most of the astronomers had moved 
to the moon or to orbiting ob- 
servatories anyway. 

But those radiators did throw 
away an awful lot of energy. One 
should be able to do something 
with it in a situation like this; 
something really useful. But what? 

Ill 

I t was really a pity that the li- 
brary contained no Fu Manchu 
or Bulldog Drummond. Hoerwitz 



needed ideas. Since it looked as 
though he would have to furnish 
his own, he selected a sheet for back- 
ground material, slipped it into the 
scanner and drifted toward the cob- 
webby hammock in the center of 
the lounge while Flavius berated 
the holiday-making citizens of Rome 
on the screen. It was reasonably 
appropriate; the manager drowsed; 
there was certainly an Ides of 
March coming. He wished his finger 
would stop hurting. The script and 
background music flowed along a 
track that his awareness had fol- 
lowed a hundred times before .... 

The frantic disclaimers of Cinna 
the Poet awakened him. He had 
drifted and been held against the 
hammock by the current from the 
air circulator. The feeble gravity 
which gave the visiting ship a 
weight of five hundred pouiMls at 
the surface was of course absent 
in the living quarters at the center 
of the asteroid. Almost automatical- 
ly he pushed himself back to the 
console and shut off the sheet-scan- 
ner at the end of the third act. Ob- 
viously this wasn’t helping him to 
think. He’d better check the con- 
vertor monitors just to wake him- 
self up and then get some eKcrdse. 

Robinson was in the tunnel out- 
side the lounge and without say- 
ing a word followed Mac along the 
passage. The fellow was certainly 
not very much at home in zero 
gravity; his coordination as he pass- 
ed himself from handhold to hand-

hold was worse than sloppy. If this 
were equally true of the others, it 
might be a help. 

As things turned out, it was. 

, Smith and Jones were in the 
control room, drifting idly away 
from the walls. Another good sign. 
Either they, too, were unused to 
free fall or had completely dismissed 
Hoerwitz from their minds as a 
menace. Neither of themf could have 
gotten into action for quite a few 
seconds, since neither had a pushoff 
point within reach — not even each 
other. 

They said nothing as the manager 
and his satellite entered, but watch- 
ed the former as he aim^ and push- 
ed off from a point beside the door 
and drifted along the indicator pan- 
els, taking in their readings as he 
went. Somewhat to his regret, 
though not to his surprise since no 
alarms had sounded, Mac found 
everything going as programmed. 
He reached the far end of the 
room and reversed his drift, aiming 
for the door. The new course took 
him within reach of Robinson, and 
that individual at a nod from Smith 
seized the old man’s arm as he 
went by. 

This was a slight mistake. The 
result was a two-body system spin- 
ning with a period of about five 
seconds and travelling toward the 
door at about a quarter of Hoer- 
witz’s former speed. The manager 
took advantage of the other’s con- 
fusion to choose the time and style 



of his breakaway from the system. 
He came to a halt, spin gone, four 
or five yards from the meeting 
point. Robinson, who had been made 
a free gift of their joint angular 
momentiun, brought up with his 
head in painful contact with the 
edge of the doorway. Mac couldn’t 
pretend to be sorry; Jones concealed 
a grin rather unsuccessfully, and 
Smith showed no sign of caring ei- 
ther way. His order to stop Hoer- 
witz for a conversation had been 
obeyed; the details didn’t bother 
him. 

4 4 T T ow long is our fuel going to 
take?” he asked. 

“Another fifty to fifty-five hours, 
barring offtrack developments,” re- 
plied the manager. “I gave you an 
estimate at the beginning, and 
there’s no reason to change it so 
far. I trust these instruments, un- 
less you or one of your friends 
have been playing with circuits. I 
know you jimmied the radio, but 
if your man knew what he was 
about that shouldn’t have bothered 
this board.” 

“That’s all I wanted to know. 
Do what you want until it’s time 
to check your instruments again.” 

“It’s night by my clocks. I’m 
sleeping for a few hours, now that 
I’ve had my daily workout. I see 
you know where my quarters are — 
what were you searching for, guns 
or radios? You brought the only 
weapons this place has ever seen 

IE

yourselves, and a radio able to reach 
Earth is a little too large to hide 
in a photo album.’’ 

^^Spacesuit radios are pretty 
small.” 

‘‘But they’re in spacesuits.” 

“All right. We just like to be 
sure. Wouldn’t you be happier to 
know that we weren’t worrying 
about you?” Hoerwitz left without 
tr}dng to answer that. Smith looked 
after him for a few seconds, and 
then beckoned to Brown. 

“Don’t interfere with his routine, 
but keep an eye on the old fellow. 
I’m not so sure we really con- 
vinced him, after all. I’d much 
rather keep him around to do the 
work, but the job is much too im- 
portant to take chances.” Brown 
nodded, and followed Hoerwitz back 
to the latter’s quarters. Then he 
took up his station outside, glanced 
at his watch, helped himself to a 
set of the pills needed to keep hu- 
man metabolism in balance under 
zero-G, and relaxed. The “night” 
wore on. 

Hoerwitz had been perfectly sin- 
cere about his intention of sleep- 
ing. He had developed the habit of 
spending much of his time in that 
state during his years at the station. 
His age may have been partly re- 
sponsible, but the life itself was 
hardly one to keep a man alert. 
Few people could be found to ac- 
cept the lonely and boring jobs in 
the off-Earth factories — so few 
that many of them had to be run 



entirely by computer and remote 
control. Hoerwitz happened to be 
one of the sort who could spend all 
his time quite happily with abstract 
entertainment — books, plays, 
music or poetry. He could reread a 
book, or see the same play over and 
over again, with full enjoyment, 
just as many people can get pleasure 
out of hearing the same music re- 
peatedly. Few jobs on Earth would 
have permitted him to spend so 
much time amusing himself; the ar- 
rangement was ideal both for him 
and his employers. Still, he slept a 
lot. 

He therefore woke up refreshed, 
if not exactly vigorous, some nine 
hours after Brown had taken up 
his guard station. He was not o*»ly 
refreshed but enthusiastic. He had 
.a plan. It was not a very compB- 
cated one, but it might keep him 
alive. 

It had two parts. One was to con- 
vince Smith that the intruders could 
not load their loot without Mac’s 
help. This should be simple enough, 
since it was pretty certainly true. 
Shifting twelve million pounds of 
mass by muscle-power, even in 
zero-G, is impractical for four men 
in any reasonable time. The alter- 
native was the station’s loadhag 
equipment, and it was unlikely that 
anyone but Hoerwitz would be ex- 
pert in its use. If the thieves were 
convinced of that, at least they’d 
keep him alive until the last minute. 

The second part of the plan was 



BULGE 



17 




to arrange for himself a refuge or 
hiding place good enough to dis- 
courage the four from spending the 
time necessary to get him. This 
assumed that they had assigned 
high priority to getting away as 
soon as possible after loading the 
stolen fuel, which seemed reason- 
able. Det^ here, however, re- 
quired more thinking. It might be 
better to trust to concealment; on 
the other hand, there was something 
to be said for a place whose lo- 
cation was known to the enemy 
but which obviously couldn^t be 
penetrated without a lot of time and 
effort. 

/^n the whole, the latter choice 
would make him feel safer, but 
he couldn’t offhand think of a 
really impregnable spot. There 
were very few doors of any kind in 
the station, and even fewer of these 
could be locked. Air-breaks were 
solid, but not made to resist intelli- 
gent attack. None of the few locks 
in the place was any better in that 
respect, if one assumed that the 
thieves were of professional caliber. 

Of course, much of the factory 
equipment itself, designed to con- 
tain nuclear reactions, would have 
resisted any imaginable tools. None 
of this codd, however, be regard- 
ed as practical for hiding purposes; 
one might as well get inside a blast 
furnace or sulfuric-acid chamber. 

All in all, it looked as though 
straight concealment were going to 



be more practical, and this pretty 
well demanded the outside of the 
asteroid. 

The tunnels of the station were 
complex enough to make a fairly 
good labyrinth, but there was a 
reasonable basic pattern underlying 
their arrangement. Hoerwitz knew 
this pattern so wdl, quite natural- 
ly, that it never bccurred to him 
that his unwelcome guests might 
have trouble finding him in the 
maze once he got out of sight. He 
did think of turning out the lights 
to complicate their job, but they 
shoidd have little trouble turning 
them back on again. Robinson, at 
least, must know something about 
electricity. Besides, darkness and 
weightlessness together were a very 
bad combination even for someone 
as used to the latter as Hoerwitz. 
No, outside would be best. 

The asteroid was far from 
spherical, had a reasonable amount 
of surface area, and its jagged sur- 
face promised all sorts of hiding 
places. This was especially true in 
the contrasty lighting of airlessness. 
Mac could think of a dozen possi- 
ble spots immediately — his years 
of residence had not been spent 
entirely inside. During safe periods 
he had taken several trips outside 
(safe periods meant, among other 
things, the presence of company; 
taking a lone walk in a spacesuit is 
about as sensible as taking a lone 
swim in the Indian Ocean). 

More familiarity with the surface 

IF 



18 




would have been nice, but what 
little he had should at least be 
greater than the others did. If he 
were to drop casually some remark 
which would give the impression 
that he knew the outside like one 
of his own Shakespeare sheets, they 
might not even bother to search 
once he was out of sight — pro- 
vided he waited until there was 
very little time left before they 
were leaving, and provided he was 
able to disappear at all. Too many 
ifs? Maybe. 

It was also important that Smith 
not change his mind about letting 
Hoerwitz take walks outside. It 
wouldn’t require careful guarding to 
prevent such an excursion; five sec- 
onds’ work on Mac’s spacesuit 
would take care of that. It was 
annoying that so much of the plan 
depended more on Smith’s attitude 
than on Hoerwitz’s action, especial- 
ly since Smith didn’t seem to be- 
lieve in taking chances. The atti- 
tude would be hard to control. The 
manager would have to seem com- 
pletely harmless — but he’d better 
take Hamlet’s advice about over- 
acting. 

That was a matter of basic be- 
havior. On the question of useful 
action, there was another factor to 
consider. At the present setup rate, 
the isotopes the thieves wanted 
would be ready ten or a dozen hours 
before perigee, which Mac was still 
taking as the latest time they’d 
want to stay around. Something 



really ought to be done to delay 
the conversion and delivery process, 
to keep at a minimum the supply of 
spare moments which could be de- 
voted to looking for missing factory 
managers. Could he slow down the 
converters without arousing suspi- 
cion? He knew much about the ma- 
chines, and the others presumably 
knew very little, but trying to fool 
them with some piece of fiction 
woidd be extremely risky. His left 
hand gave an extra twinge at the 
thought. 

Of course, some genuine trouble 
could develop. It hadn’t in all his 
years at the station, but it could. 
There was no point waiting for it, 
and even if it did they’d probably 
blame him anyway, but — could he, 
perhaps, arrange for something to 
happen which would obviously be 
Jones’s fault? Or Smith’s own? The 
basic idea was attractive, but de- 
tails failed to crystallize. 

It was certainly high time for 
action, though if he hoped to ac- 
complish anything such as living; 
the closer to completion the pro- 
cess came, the less good a slowdown 
would accomplish. In fact, it was 
time to stop daydreaming and get 
to work. Hoerwitz nodded slowly 
to himself as ideas began to shape 
up.

been forced to reprogram. One of 
them had already been processing 
a Class IV order and was now ap- 
proaching the climax of its run. It 
seemed wiser to point this out to 
the thieves so that they wouldn’t 
think he was up to anything when 
he shut this one down, as he would 
have to do in a few hours. He did 
so. 

“At least you people won’t have 
to do everything at once,” he re- 
marked. 

“What do you mean?” asked 
Brown. 

“When you came, I told you that 
one of the units was on Four al- 
ready. You can tell your boss that 
it should be ready to load in eight 
hours or so. I’ll show you where 



the loading conveyors are handled 
from — or do you want to lug it 
out by hand? You were bragging 
about carting five hundred pounds 
of ship around when you came.” 

“Don’t be funny, old fellow,” cut 
in Robinson. “You might as well 
have that loading machinery ready. 
You might even be ready to show 
a couple of us how to use it. If 
Smith should decide he doesn’t like 
your attitude, we might be the only 
ones able to.” 

“All right with me,” replied the 
manager. He felt reasonably safe 
as long as Smith himself was not 
present. It had seemed likely that 
none of the others would dare do 
anything drastic to him without di- 
rect orders, and Robinson’s remark 



BULGE 



21 



had strengthened the belief. “The 
controls are in a dome at the sur- 
face. They’re simple enough, like a 
chess game.” 

“What does that crack mean?” 

“Just what it sounded like. Any 
six-year-old can learn the rules of 
chess in an hour, but that doesn’t 
make him a good player. I’m sure 
Mr. Smith won’t need you to re- 
mind him of that when you suggest 
that you ought to do the loading.” 
The two men glanced at each other, 
and Robinson shrugged. 

“Better show me where the con- 
trols are, anyway,” he said. “You 
better stay here,” he added to 
Brown. “I’ll be with Hoerwitz, but 
Smith said this panel was never to 
be left unwatched. We might not 
have time to explain if he found 
us both gone.” The other man 
nodded. Hoermtz, keeping his face 
as expressionless as he could, led 
the way to the station he had men- 
tioned. 

^T^his was about as far from the 
A control chamber as anything 
could be, since it was at the sur- 
face. It lay near the main entrance, 
a quarter of the way around the 
asteroid’s equator from the radia- 
tors. The converters themselves 
were scattered at fairly regular in- 
tervals just imder the surface. The 
general idea was that if one of them 
did misbehave it would meet only 
token resistance outward, and the 
rest of the plant might have a 



chance. Access and loading tunnels 
connecting the converters with the 
cargo locks and the living quarters 
were deliberately crooked. All these 
tricks would of course be futile in 
a major blowup, but it is possible 
to have minor accidents even in 
nuclear engineering. 

The dome containing the loading 
control panels was one of the few 
places offering a direct view to the 
outside of the asteroid. It had 
served as a conning site while the 
body was being driven in from be- 
yond Mars; it still was sometimes 
used that way. The thrust pits were 
still in service, as the present long, 
narrow orbit was heavily perturb- 
ed by the moon and required oc- 
casional correction near apogee. 
This was not done by Hoerwitz, who 
could no more have corrected an or- 
bit than he could have built a 
spaceship. The thrust controls were 
disconnected except when a ballis- 
tics engineer was on hand. 

The dome was small, little more 
than a dozen feet across, and its 
entire circle was rimmed with con- 
veyor control panels. Hoerwitz, 
quite unintentionally, had exag- 
gerated their simplicity. This might 
have gotten him into trouble ^th 
anyone but Robinson. Without 
worr3dng about this situation, since 
he failed to recognize it, the man- 
ager promptly began explaining. 

“First, you want to be careful 
about these two guarded switches 
on each panel,” he pointed out. 

IF 



22 




‘‘They’re designed to bypass the 
safeties which normally keep you 
from putting too hot a load on the 
conveyors, so that you can dump a 
converter in an emergency. At the 
moment, since all the units are hot, 
you couldn’t operate any part of 
conveyor system except by those 
switches. 

“Basically, the whole thing is 
simple enough. One panel is con- 
cerned with each of the twenty 
separate conveyor systems, and all 
panels are alike, so — ” 

“Why didn’t they make just one 
panel, then, and have a selector to 
set it on any one of the reactors?” 
asked Robinson. Hoerwitz sadly re- 
vised upward his estimate of the 
fellow’s brain power, as he answer- 
ed. 

“Often several ships are loading, 
or several reactors unloading, at 
one time. It turned out to be sim- 
pler and safer to have independent 
control systems. Also, the system 
works both ways — customers get 
credit for mass brought to the sta- 
tion for conversion. We have to 
take material to the converters as 
well as away from them, and it’s 
more efficient to be able to carry 
on several operations at once. The 
original idea, as you probably 
know, was to use the mass of the 
asteroid itself for conversion; but 
with laws about controlling rotation 
so that the radiators would point 
away from earth most of the time, 
and the expense of the original in- 



stallation, and the changes in orbit 
and angular momentum and so on, 
they finally decided it was better 
to try to keep the mass of the 
place fairly constant. They did use 
quite a bit of material from it at 
first. There are a lot of useless 
tunnels inside, and quite a few pits 
outside, left over from those days.” 
Hoerwitz was watching his lis- 
tener covertly as he spoke, trying 
to judge how much of this infor- 
mation was being absorbed, but 
the other’s face was unreadable. 
He gave up and went on with the 
lesson. 

They were joined after about a 
quarter of an hour by Smith, but 
the head thief said little, merely or- 
dering the instruction to continue. 
The factory manager decided to 
take no more chances testing his 
listeners with double-talk; Smith 
had impressed him as being a dif- 
ferent proposition from his follow- 
ers. The decision to play safe in his 
presence proved a wise one. 

I t took another ten minutes for 
Mac to wind up the lesson. 
“You’ll need some practice,” he 
concluded, “and there’s no way to 
get it just yet. I was never a 
schoolteacher, but I understand 
that your best way of making sure 
how well you know something is 
to try to teach it to someone else. 
I trust Mr. Smith approves of that 
thought.” 

“I do.” Smith’s face didn’t show 



BULGE 



23 




approval or anything else, but the 
words were encoiuraging. 

‘‘Give me a lesson right now, 
Rob. I’d particularly like to know 
just what this smtch does — or 
did Mr. Hoerwitz forget to men- 
tion it?” He indicated the emer- 
gency-dump override. 

“Oh, no, he showed me that first. 
We’d better keep clear of it, be- 
cause it empties that particular 
converter onto its conveyor and 
dumps it into space, even though 
it’s still hot.” 

For a moment there might have 
been a flicker of surprise on Smith’s 
face. 

“And he told you about it? I 
rather thought he might skip items 
like that in the hope that one of 
us might make a mistake he could 
not be blamed for.” Hoerwitz de- 
cided that it would be less suspi- 
cious to answer that remark than to 
let it pass. 

“‘Is there an3rthing that could 
possibly go wrong that you would 
not blame me for?” he asked. 

“Probably not, at that. I’m glad 
you realize it, Mr. Hoerwitz. Per- 
haps I’ll be spared the nuisance of 
having to leave a man on guard 
here as well as at the main con- 
trols.” He glanced through the 
dome’s double wall at Earth’s fat 
crescent, which dominated the sky 
on one side of the meridian as the 
did on the other. “Is there any way 
of shutting off access to this place 
until we’re ready to use it? Think 



how much more at ease we’d both 
feel if there were.” 

Hoerwitz shrugged. “No regular 
door. There are a couple of safety 
air-breaks in the corridor below; 
you could get one of them closed 
easily enough, since there are man- 
ual switches for them as well as 
the pressure and temperature dif- 
ferential sensors, but it would be 
a lot harder to open. If one of those 
things does shut, it’s normally be- 
cause air is being lost or dangerous 
reactions going on on one side or 
the other. A good deal of red tape 
is necessary to convince the ma- 
chinery that all is well after all.” 

“Hmph.” Smith looked thought- 
ful. “All right, we’ll consider it. 
Rob, you stay here until I de- 
cide. You come with me, old fel- 
low.” Hoerwitz obeyed with mixed 
feelings. 

It was lucky he hadn’t tried to 
dump the reactors and shut him- 
self off in the dome section, in 
view of Smith’s perspicacity, but 
he couldn’t thank his own intelli- 
gence or foresight for saving him. 
The sad fact was that he’d never 
thought of the trick until he was 
explaining matters to Robinson. 
Now it was certainly too late. Of 
course, it probably wouldn’t have 
worked an3nvay, since someone like 
Robinson could presumably get mr 
doors open again in short order; 
and there was an even brighter 
side, now that he thought of it. The 
last few minutes might well have 



24 



IF 




gone far to convincing Smith that 
the manager was really reconciled 
to the situation. One could not be 
sure of that, naturally, with a per- 
son like Smith, but one could hope. 
Time would no doubt tell — quite 
possibly in bad language. 

\ s they floated back down to- 
^ ward the living section — 
Hoerwitz noted with some regret 
that Smith was getting better at 
handling himself in free fall — 
the head thief spoke briefly. 

“Maybe youVe learned your les- 
son. From what’s just happened, I 
guess we can both hope so. Just 
the same, I don’t want to see you 
an5Twhere near that place where 
we just left Robinson, except when 
I tell you myself to go there for 
my own reasons. Is that clear?” 
“It is.” 

“Good. I don’t really enjoy per- 
suading people the hard way, but 
you may have noticed that Mr. 
Jones does. If you’ve really ac- 
cepted the fact that I have the 
bulge on you, though, we won’t 
have to amuse him.” 

“You’ve made everything very 
clear. Do you want the reactor 
which was working on Class IV 
when you came, and which will be 
ready pretty soon, to be imloaded 
as soon as it’s done?” 

“Hmph. I don’t know. Does your 
loading machine deliver to any spot 
on the surface, or just by that 
dome?” 



“Just at the dome, I’m afraid. 
It wouldn’t have been practical 
to run conveyors all over the place, 
and it’s even less so to drive trucks 
around on the surface.” 

“All right. If it would mean mov- 
ing our ship an extra time we’ll 
wait until everything is ready. It 
would be a nuisance to have to 
guard it, too.” 

“Jhen you’re not really con- 
vinced I’ve learned my lesson, after 
aU.” 

“Don”t ask too many questions, 
Mr. Hoerwitz. Why not just as- 
sume that I don’t like to take 
chances?” 

The manager was not inclined 
to act on impulse, but he sometimes 
talked on that basis. This was one 
of the times. 

“I don’t want to assume that.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because one of yom: most ob- 
vious ways of not taking chances 
would be to leave no witnesses. If 
I believed you were that thorough. 
I might as well stop everything now 
and let you shoot me — not that 
I really enjoy the prospect, but I 
could at least die with the satisfac- 
tion that I hadn’t helped you.” 

“That’s logical,” Smith answered 
thoughtfully. “I have only two an- 
swers to it. One you already know 
— we wouldn’t just shoot you. The 
other, which I hope will make you 
feel better, is that we aren’t wor- 
ried about witnesses. You’ve been 
reading too much. We’ll have lived

in this place for several days be- 
fore were done, but you must have 
noticed that we aren’t wearing 
gloves to keep from leaving fin- 
gerprints, or spacesuits to foil the 
scene analyzers, or anything else of 
that sort. I’m sure the law will 
know who was here after we’ve 
gone, but that doesn’t worry us. 
They already want us for so many 
different things that our main care 
is to avoid getting caught up with, 
not identified. 

“Then why those names? Do you 
expect me to believe they’re real?” 

For almost the first time. Smith 
showed emotion. He grinned. “Go 
baci to your drama sheets, Mr. 
Hoerwitz, but stick to Shakespeare. 
Lord Peter Wimsey is leading you 
astray. Just remember what I said 
about the conveyor controls: keep 
away from them.” 

V 

Tf his finger hadn’t been^so pain- 
ful, Hoerwitz woidd have been 
quite happy as he made his way 
back to the lounge and let the air 
currents settle him into the ham- 
mock. He shunted Julius Caesar in- 
to the “hold” stack without zero- 
ing its tracker, started The Paja- 
ma Game, and remained awake 
through the whole show. It was 
quite an occasion. 

For the next couple of days ev- 
eryone was on almost friendly 
terms, though Hoerwitz’s finger 



kept him from forgetting entirely 
the basic facts of the situation or 
warming up very much to Jones. 
Some of the men watched shows 
with him, and there was even cas- 
ual conversation entirely uncem- 
nected with reactors and fuel pro- 
cessing. Smith’s psychology was 
working fairly well. 

It did not backfire on him un- 
til about twenty hours before peri- 
gee. 

At that time Mac had been mak- 
ing one of periodic control checks, 
and had reported that the nms 
would be finishing off during the 
next ten or twelve hours. He would 
have to stay at the board, since 
they would not all end at the same 
time, and it was safer to oversee 
the supposedly automatic cooling of 
each converter as its job ended. 

“What’s aU that for?” asked 
Smith. “I thought it didn’t matter 
much what was in the converters 
at the start. Why will it hint if 
a little of this is still inside when 
you begin your next job? Won’t it 
just be converted along with ev- 
erything else?” 

“It’s not quite that simple,” re- 
plied the manager. “‘Basically you 
are right; we don’t deal in pure 
products, and what we deliver is 
processed chemically by our cus- 
tomers. Still, it’s best to start clean. 
If too much really hot stuff were 
allowed to accumulate in the con- 
verters between runs, it could be 
bad. If Class I or II fuel intended 



26 



IF 




to power a chemical industry, for 
example, were contaminated with 
Class IV there could be trouble on 
Earth — especially if the plant in 
question were doing a chemical 
separation of nuclear fuels.” 

“But it’s all Class IV this time,” 
pointed out Smith, “unless you’ve 
been running a major bluff on us, 
and I’m sure you wouldn’t do that.” 
His face hardened, and once more 
Hoerwitz mentally kicked himself. 
He hadn’t even thought of such a 
trick, and he could probably have 
gotten away with it. There was no 
easy way to identify directly the 
isotopes being put out by the con- 
verters; it took specialized appara- 
tus and specialized knowledge. It 
was pretty certain that Smith had 
neither. Well, too late now. 

“It’s all one class, as you said,” 
the manager admitted with what he 
hoped was negligible relay, “but 
that’s just it. With Class IV in ev- 
ery converter and on every convey- 
or it’s even more important than 
usual to watch the cooling. I live 
here, you know. I’m not an engineer 
and don’t know what would happen 
if any of that stuff found its way 
into the hydrogen reactors, but I’d 
rather not find out.” 

“But you must be enough of an 
engineer to handle the fusion units.” 
“That doesn’t demand an engi- 
neer. I’m a button pusher. I can op- 
erate them very sensibly, but they 
don’t waste a trained engineer out 
here with the price of skilled labor 

BULg; 



what it is. The trouble frequency 
of these plants is far too low to 
keep one twiddling his thumbs on 
standby the whole time.” 

‘“But how about safety? If this 
place blows apart, it would take 
quite a few centuries of engineers’ 
pay to replace it, I’d think.” 

“No doubt. I suspect that’s the 
point they’re trying to make, in or- 
der to modify or get rid of that 
law about hydrogen reactors on 
Earth. The idea is that if the com- 
pany trusts them enough to risk 
all this capital without a resident 
engineer, what’s everyone worried 
about?” 

“But the place could really let 
go if the right — or I should say 
the wrong — things happened.” 

4 4 T suppose so, but I don’t know 
what they’d be, short of de- 
liberate mishandling. In the forty 
years I’ve been here nothing out of 
line had ever happened. I’ve never 
had to use that emergency dump 
I’ve showed you, or even the 
straight shutoff on the main board. 
Engineers come twice a year to 
check everything over, and I just 
move switches — like this.” He be- 
gan manipulating controls. “Num- 
ber thirteen has flashed over. I’m 
shutting down, and in about an 
hour it can be transferred from 
field-bottle to physical containers.” 
“Why not now? What’s this 
field-bottle?” 

Hoerwitz was genuinely sur- 



27 




prised, and once again annoyed. 
He had supposed everyone knew 
about that; if he had realized that 
Smith didn^t. Well, another 
chance gone. 

“At conversion energies no mate- 
rial will hold the charge in. Three 
hundred tons of an 5 rthing at all, at 
star-core temperature^ would feel 
cramped in a hundred cubic miles 
of space, to say nothing of a hun- 
dred cubic yards. It’s held in by 
fields, since nothing else will do 
it, and surrounded by a free-elec- 
tron layer that reflects just about 
all the radiation back into the plas- 
ma. The little bit that isn’t reflect- 
ed is carried, also by free-electron 
field, to the radiators.” 

“I think you’re trying some- 
thing,” Smith said sternly, and the 
manager felt his stomach misbe- 
have again. “You said that those 
loads could be dumped in an emer- 
gency by the conveyors. And you 
described the conveyors as simply 
mechanical belt-and-bucket sys- 
tems, a couple of days ago. Stuff 
that you just described would blow 
them into gas. Which was the lie?” 

“Neither 1 ” Hoerwitz gasped 
desperately. “I didn’t say that the 
emergency dumping was instantane- 
ous — it isn’t. The process involves 
fast chilling,, using the same con- 
ductor fields; and even with them, 
we’d expect the conveyors to need 
replacing if we ever used the sys- 
tem!” 

“If that’s so,” Smith asked, “What 



do you mean by saying a while ago 
that you didn’t know what could 
happen to blow this place up? If 
one of those fields let go — ” 

“Oh, but it couldn’t. There are 
all sorts of automatic safety sys- 
tems. I don’t have to worry about 
that sort of thing. If a field starts 
to weaken, the energy loss auto- 
matically drains into conductor 
fields, and they carry plasma ener- 
gy that much faster to the radia- 
tors, so the plasma cools and the 
pressure drops — I can’t give you 
all the details because I don’t un- 
derstand them myself, but it’s a 
real fail-safe.” 

Smith still looked suspicious, 
though he was as accustomed as 
any civilized person to trusting ma- 
chinery. It wasn’t the machinery 
that bothered him just now. 

“You keep switdiing,” he snap- 
ped, “and I don’t like it. One min- 
ute you say nothing can happen, 
and the next you talk about all 
these emergency features in case it 
does. Either the people who built 
this place didn’t know what they 
were doing, or you’re not leveling.” 

Hoerwitz’s stomach felt even 
worse, but he kept up the battle. 

“That’s not wtet I said! I told 
you things couldn’t happen because 
of the safety stuff! They knew 
what they were doing when they 
built this place — of course, half 
the major governments on Earth 
were passing laws about the way it 
should be done — ” 



28 



IF 




“Passing laws? For something off 
Earth?” 

“Sure. Ninety-five per cent of 
the company’s potentii customers 
yfeve nationals of those countries, 
and there’s nothing like economic 
pressure. Now, will you stop this 
nonsense and let me work, or de- 
cide you don’t trust me and do it 
all yourself? There are more reac- 
tors almost ready to flash over,” 

Tt was the wrong line for the old 
man to take, but Smith also 
made a mistake in resenting it. It 
was here that his psychology really 
went wrong. 

“I don’t trust you,” he said. 
“Not one particle. You’ve evaded 
every detailed question I asked. I 
don’t even know for certain that 
that’s Class stuff you’ve been 
cooking for me.” 

“That’s right. You don’t.” Hoer- 
witz, too, was losing his tact and 
foresight. “I’ve been expecting you 
to make some sort of test ever since 
I set up the program. Or did you 
take for granted that whoever you 
found here would be scared into 
doing just what you wanted? Sure- 
ly it isn’t possible that you and 
the friends you said were somewhere 
else just don’t have anyone able to 
make such a test! Any properly 
planned operation would have made 
getting such a person its first step, 
I should think — or have I been 
reading too much again?” 

The expression which had start- 



ed to develop on Smith’s face diS-< 
appeared, and he looked steadily; 
at the old man for perhaps half ^ 
minute. Then he spoke. 

“Mr. Jones. I think we will havei 
to start Phase Two of the persua- 
sion plan. Will you please prepare! 
for it? We planned this operation, 
as you call it, Mr. Hoerwitz, quite' 
carefully, in view of certain limita- 
tions which faced us. Exactly whaj 
those limitations were is ^ none of 
your business, but remember that 
we so arranged matters that no one 
on Earth has been seriously worried 
by your failure to commimicate — 
nor will they for some time yet. We 
know that no scheduled freighters 
are due here for two more revolu- 
tions, though we recognize the 
chance of a tramp tug dropping in 
with mass to deposit for credit — ■ 
that is why we plan to have the 
job done before the next perigee. 
Oiu: plans also included detmls for 
insuring the cooperation of the per- 
son we found on duty. The fact 
that he turned out to be about three 
times as old as we expected doesa^ 
affect those plans at all. You have 
experienced the first part of them. 
I was rather hoping that no mwe 
would be necessary, but you seem to 
have forgotten that we have the 
bulge on you. Therefore, you wiU 
experience the second part, unless 
you can think of a way to prove to 
me that you have been telling the 
truth — and prove it in a very short 
time. I won’t tell you what the time

limit is, but I have already decided 
on it. Start thinking, Mr. Hoerwitz. 
I believe Mr. Jones is ready.” 
Hoerwitz couldn^t think. He prob- 
ably couldn’t have thought if the 
same situation had faced him forty 
or fifty years earlier; he had nev- 
er claimed to be a hero. He spoke, 
but — as Smith had intended — 
it was without any sort of consid- 
eration. 

“The Class IV stuff that was go- 
ing when you arrived — it’s cool 
— you could get a sample of it and 
test it in your ship’s power plant 1” 
“Not good enough. I never doubt- 
ed that you were telling the truth 
about that load. It will have to be 
something else. The material that’s 
finishing now, or your claim that 
could really go wrong enough to 
blow this place into vapor if your 
fail-safe rigs weren’t there — ” 
“But how could I possibly prove 
that, except by doing it?” gasped 
the old man. 

“Your problem. Think fast. Mr. 
Jones will be with you in a moment. 
In fact, I think he’s on the way 
now — not hurrying, you under- 
stand, because he isn’t really pro- 
ficient at moving around in this no- 
weight nuisance — but I think if 
I looked around I’d see that he had 
pushed off and was drifting your 
way. It would be unfair of me to 
spoil his fun if he gets to you be- 
fore you’ve thought of something, 
wouldn’t it?” 

Smith of course meant to reduce 



the manager to a state of complete 
panic in which he would be unable 
to lie, or at least to lie convincing- 
ly; but just as he had planned bad- 
ly in not getting hold of a nuclear 
engineer of his own, he had plan- 
ned badly in failing to consider all 
the possible results of panic. He 
may, of course, have realized that 
Hoerwitz might try to do something 
desperate, but failed to foresee how 
hard such an action would be to 
stop in the unfamiliar environment 
of weightlessness. It was easy to 
take for granted that a person with 
such a frail physique could be con- 
trolled physically by anyone with 
no trouble. This was perfectly cor- 
rect — for anyone within reach of 
the old man. 

N o one was. Wdrse, from Smith’s 
point of view, no one but Rob- 
inson was in a position to get there. 
As a result, Mac was able to do 
something which he would never 
have seriously considered if he had 
been given time to think. He was, 
of course, within reach of a push- 
off point as a matter of habit. He 
used every bit of muscle his frail 
old body could muster in a dive 
toward the center of the board — 
and made it. 

Only Robinson had learned his 
lesson about drifting, and he mis- 
judged his own pushoff and failed 
to intercept the manager. Hoerwitz 
reached and opened a plainly la- 
beled switch, and with the action 



30 



IF 




his panic left him as suddenly as 
it had come, though fear still 
churned at his stomach. 

“At least, you believed me enough 
not to risk bullets in the controls,” 
he almost sneered. “There’s your 
proof, Mr. Smith. I’ve just shut 
down all the converters. They’re 
bleeding energy out of the main ra- 
diators and will be cool enough to 
handle in an hour. If you replace 
that switch, you’ll know I was tell- 
ing the truth about safeties. Go 
ahead. Close it. It’s safe. All you’ll 
get is a bunch of red lights all over 
the boards, telling you that safety 
circuits are blocking you. You’ll 
have to start those processes from 
the beginning. I can set that up 
for you, of course. I will if you 
give the order; but anything else 
at all, except dumping the loads, 
of course, will block you with safe- 
ties.” 

“Why?” Smith was still in con- 
trol of himself, though it was a visi- 
ble strain. 

“Wliat do you think I am, an 
astrophysicist? I don’t know why, 
if you want one of those detailed 
answers you were complaining 
about not getting. They come in 
high class equations. In words, 
which is all I understand about it, 
most of the processing time in 
these converters is for setup. The 
actual conversion is the sort of 
thing that goes on in the last mo- 
ments of a supernova’s fling, as I 
thought everyone knew. The con- 



verter has to set up millions of 
parameters in terms of tempera- 
ture, density gradients, potential 
of all sorts — even the cbanging 
distance from Earth in this orbit 
has to be allowed for, I imderstand 
— and I don’t know what else be- 
fore the final step is triggered, if a 
decent percentage of the desired iso- 
tope class is to be produced. I’ve 
just cleared the setup in eighteen 
of those converters. If you were ac- 
tually to build them up to the tem- 
perature they had before I hit that 
switch, you probably wdtdd blow 
the place up. Hence, my friend, the 
safeties. Working out a reaction 
that not only produces useful iso- 
topes but also balances endothermic 
and exothermic processes closely 
to hold the whole works under 
control is a perfectly good subject 
for a doctorate thesis. Do you think 
we coidd define a supernova — 
or even a few tons of one? Now, 
do you want me to start these 
stoves all over, or will you take 
two loads of Class IV instead of 
twenty, pull out all my fingernails 
and fly off in a rage gnashing your 
teeth?” 

During this diatribe Smith had 
actually calmed down, which was 
hardly what Hoerwitz had expected. 
The thief nodded slowly at its end. 

“I wouldn’t have said there was 
anything which could happen here 
wWch I wouldn’t blame on you,” 
he said, “but I have to admit this 
one is on me. By all means, start the

cooking over. I have learned most of 
what I need to know. I think I 
can now manage well enough even 
if visitors show up dxuring this 
overtime period you have pushed us 
into. 

“You just restart the runs you 
interrupted, and when that’s done 
come with me up to the dome. I 
want you to get the load that was 
just finished out onto the convey- 
ors. Then you may resume your 
life of leisure and entertainment. 
Hop to it, Mr. Hoerwitz.” 

The manager hopped. He was too 
surprised at Smith’s reaction to do 
anything else. He would have to re- 
check his Shakespeare memory; 
maybe there was someone like this 
after all. He worked the controls 
rapidly. 

Jones looked disappointed ex- 
cept for a moment when Robin- 
son suddenly said, “That’s not the 
way he had them set before 1” 

Smith started to raise his eye- 
brows in surprise, but the man- 
ager, who had had no thought of 
deception at the moment, said, 
''We’re not starting with the same 
stuff as before, remember. Many 
things happen long before the main 
conversion.” 

Smith stopped, thought for a 
moment, looked carefully at the 
old man, and nodded. Jones shrug- 
ged and relaxed once more. 

By this time, certain facts were 
beginning to fit together in the 
manager’s mind. 



yi 

T)y the time the trip to the dome 
had been made and the fin- 
ished load of isotopes transferred 
to its conveyor, Hoerwitz’s brief 
sense of elation had evaporated, and 
he had written himself off as a 
walking corpse. He realized just 
what details he had overlooked, and 
just where the omissions left him. 
He floated slowly to his quarters, 
his morale completely flattened and 
hope for the first time gone. 

Robinson’s acute detail memory 
must have been a major factor in 
the planning Smith had mentioned. 
If Hoerwitz himself could run the 
plant effectively without a real ba- 
sic understanding of what went on, 
so could Robinson. By arranging 
what had amounted to another les- 
son in the operation of the controls, 
the manager had made himself su- 
perfluous from the thieves’ view- 
point. 

Also, and much worse, he had 
completely missed the hole in the 
logic Smith had used when the fel- 
low had tried to prove that he real- 
ly wasn’t worried about leaving wit- 
nesses. It was quite true that the 
thieves were taking no care about 
leaving fingerprints. Why should 
they bother about such details? No 
one can analyze individual person- 
ality traces from a million-degree 
cloud of ionized gas, and they cer- 
tainly knew enough now to leave 
only that behind them. 



32 



IF 




Even if wiring around the safe- 
ty circuits was too much for Robin- 
son, which seemed unlikely in Hoer- 
witz’s present mood; they could 
always sacrifice a ton or so of their 
loot. The Class IV fuels might not 
be up to hydrogen fusion stan- 
dards, but they would be quite ade- 
quate for the purpose intended. Hid- 
ing, inside the asteroid or out, 
would be meaningless. 

The only remaining shred of his 
original plan which retained any 
relevance was the desirability of 
fooling the others about his own at- 
titude. As long as they believed 
that he expected to come out of the 
affair with his life, they would not 
expect him to do anything desper- 
ate, and they might let him live un- 
til the last moment to save them- 
selves work. If they even suspected 
that he had convinced himself that 
they were going to dispose of him. 
Smith’s dislike of taking chances 
would probably become the deciding 
factor. 

This might involve a difficult 
bit of acting. Behaving as though he 
had forgotten what had happened 
would certainly be unconvincing. 
Trying to act as though he had 
even forgiven it would be little 
better. On the other hand, any 
trace of an uncooperative attitude 
would also be dangerous. Maybe he 
should go back to Hamlet and re- 
run the prince’s instructions to the 
players. No, not worth it. He knew 
them word for word anyway, and 



the more he thought of the prob- 
lem as one of acting the less likely 
he was to get away with it. 

Maybe he shoidd just try, umob- 
trusively, to keep in Jones’s com- 
pany as much as possible. His na- 
turd feelings toward that member 
of the group were unlikely to make 
the others suspicious. 

In any case, he wouldn’t have 
to act for a while. The last couple 
of hours had been exhausting 
enough so that not even Smith was 
surprised when Mac sought his owm 
qu^ters. One of the men followed 
and took up watch outside, of 
course, but that was routine. 

The manager was in no mood 
for music. He brought the JtiMm 
Caesar sheet out of standby and 
let the scanner start at the point 
where he had left it a couple of 
days before. 

As a result, it was only a few 
minutes before Brutus solved his 
problem for him. 

I t was beautiful. There was no 
slow groping, no rejection of one 
detail and substitution of anotb^. 
It was just there, all at once. It 
would have Wertheimer, Kohler, 
and the rest of the gestalt sdMol 
dance with glee. The only extrane- 
ous thought to enter Hoerwita’s 
mind as the idea developed was a 
touch of amazement that Shake- 
speare could have written anythhig 
so relevant more than four decades 
before the birth of Isaac Newtom. 



BULGE 




He didn’t wait for the end ef 
Ihe play. There yras quite a while 
remaining before the plan could be 
put into action, so be went to deep. 
After all, a man ne^ his t^ or 
twelve hours when careful, ex- 
hausting and detailed work is in 
the offing. 

A good meal helps, too, and 
Hoerwitz prepared himself one 
when he woke up — one of his 
fander breakfasts. With that dis- 
posed of, there were seven hours to 
go before perigee. 

He went to check the controls, 
pointedly ignoring the thief on duty 
outside his quarters and the second 
one in the control room. Everything 
about the converters was going well, 
as usual, but this time the fact 
didn’t annoy him. For all he cared, 
all those loads of explosives could 
cook themselves to completion. 

They hadn’t been ordered prop- 
ierly, but there would be no trouble 
fng find cusomers for them later 
pn. 

He checked in time his impulse 
to go to the dome for a look out- 
side. Smith’s order had been very 
dear, so it would be necessary to 
trust the clocks without the help of 
a look at Earth. No matter. He 
trusted them. 

Six hours to perigee. Four and a 
half to action time. He hated leav- 
ing things so late, since there was 
doubt about Smith’s reaction to 
the key question and time ndght be 
needed to influence the fellow. 



Still, starting too soon would be 
even more dangerous. 

A show killed three of the hours, 
but he never remembered after- 
ward which show he had picked. 

Another meal helped. After all, 
it might be quite a long time be- 
fore he would eat anything but 
tube-mush, if things went right If 
they went wrong, he had the right 
to make his last meal a good one. 
It brought him dmost up to the 
deadline. He thought briefly of not 
bothering to clean the di^es, but 
decided that this was no time to 
change his habits. Smith was sus- 
picious enough by nature with- 
out giving him handles for it. 

Now a flnal check of the controls, 
which mustn’t look as though it 
were final. Normal, as usual. Rob- 
inson and Brown were in the con- 
trol room — the latter had accom- 
panied the manager from his quar- 
ters — and when the check was 
finished the old man turned to 
them. 

tflT^here is your boss?” 

’ ’Robinson shrugged. “Asleep, 
I suppose. Why?” 

“VSflien you first came, he said it 
would be all right for me to walk 
outside, once you’d jimmied the 
transmitter in my suit. I like to 
watch Earth as we go by perigee, 
but I suppose I’d better make sura 
he still doesn’t objejct.” 

“Why can’t you watch from the 
dome?”

^Tartly because he toli me £o 
keep away from there, and partly 
because in the hour and a half 
around perigee Earth shifts from 
one side of this place to the other. 
You can see only the first part 
from the dome. I like to go to the 
north pole and watch it swing 
around the horizon — you get a real 
sense of motion. Whoever Smith 
sends with me, if he lets me go at 
all, will enjoy it. Maybe he’d like 
to go himself.” 

Robinson was doubtful. ‘‘I sup- 
pose he won’t shoot anyone for 
asking. I take it this happens pret- 
ty soon.” Hoerwitz was glad of the 
chance to look at a clock without 
arousing suspicion. 

“Very soon. There won’t be much 
more than enough time to check 
our suits. Remember, there’s no 
such thing as fast walking, out- 
side.” 

“Don’t I know it. All right, I’ll 
ask him. You stay here with Mr. 
Brown.” 

“You’re sure you didn’t damage 
anything in my suit except the 
radio?” 

“Positive. Make a regular check- 
out; I stand by the result.” 

“As long as I don’t fall by it.” 
Robinson shrugged and left. “Mr. 
Brown, in view of what your friend 
just said, how about coming with 
me up to the lock so I can start 
that suit check early?” 

Brown shook his head negatively, 
and nodded toward the controls. 



“Smith said to keep it guarded.’* 
Hoerwitz decided that debate was 
useless, and waited for the leader. 
It was not really as long a wait 
as it seemed. 

Smith was accompanied by Rob- 
inson, as the manager had expect- 
ed, and also by Jones, who, Hoer- 
witz had assumed, must be on guard 
at the dome. He hadn’t stopped to 
figure out the arithmetic of three 
men on watch at once out of a to- 
tal strength of four. 

Smith wasted no time. 

“AU right, Mr. Hoewitz, let’s 
take this walk. Have you checked 
your suit?” 

“I’ve had no chance.” 

“All right, let’s get to it. Tell me 
what you expect to see as we go 
up. With your suit radio out you 
won’t be able to give a proper 
guide’s talk outside.” 

T he manager obeyed, repeating 
what he had told Robinson 
and Brown a few minutes before. 
The recital lasted to the equip- 
ment chamber inside the airlock, 
where the old man fell silent as 
he started to make the meticulous 
checkout which was routine for 
people who had survived much ex- 
perience in spacesuits. He was ^- 
pecially careful of the nuclear-pow- 
ered air-recyclmg equipment and 
the reserve tanks which made up 
for its unavoidable slight ineffi- 
ciency. He was hoping to depend on 
them for quite a while.

Satisfied, he looked up and spoke 
once more. 

‘‘I mentioned only the north pole 
walk,” he said, “because I assume 
you’d disapprove of something else 
I often do. At the place where 
Earth is overhead at perigee, right 
opposite the radiators, I have a six- 
foot optical flat with a central "hole. 
You probably know the old dis- 
tress-mirror trick. I have friends at 
several places on Earth, and some- 
times at perigee I stand there and 
flash sunlight at them. The beam 
from the mirror is only about 
twelve or fifteen miles wide at a 
thousand miles; and if I aim it 
right it looks brighter than Venus 
from the other end — they can 
spot in full daylight without much 
trouble. Naturally the mirror has 
to be in sunlight itself, and as I re- 
member it won’t be this time, but 
I thought I’d better mention it in 
case you came across the mirror as 
we wandered around and got the 
idea that I was up to something.” 

“That was very wise of you, Mr. 
Hoerwitz. Actually, I doubt that 
there will be any random wander- 
ing. Mr. Jones will remain very 
close to you at all times, and unless 
you yourself approach the mirror 
he is unlikely to. I trust you will 
have a pleasant walk and am sure 
that there is no point in reminding 
you of the impossibility of finding 
a man drifting in space.” 

“One chance in ten thousand 
isn’t exactly impossible, but I’d 



rather not depend on it,” admit- 
ted the manager. “But aren’t you 
coming?” 

“No. Possibly some other time. 
Enjoy yourself.” 

Mac wondered briefly whether 
he had made some mistake. He 
had told only two lies since bring- 
ing up the subject of the walk 
and felt pretty sure that if Smith, 
had detected either of them the 
fact would now be obvious. 

But he had expected to get out 
only by interesting Smith himself 
in the trip. If Smith didn’t want 
to go, why was he permitting it 
at all? Out of kindheartedness? 

No. Obviously not. 

For a moment Hoerwitz wished ’ 
he hadn’t eaten that last meal. 
It threatened to come back on him 
as he saw what must be Smith’s 
reason. Then he decided he might 
as well enjoy the memory of it 
while he could. After that, al- 
most in a spirit of bravado, he 
made a final remark. 

“Jones, I don’t pretend to care, 
what happens to you outside, but 
you might remember one thing.” 

“What?” The fellow paused with 
his helmet almost in place. 

“If I do anything that you think 
calls for shooting me, be sure you 
are holding on to something tight- 
ly or that your line of fire is up- 
ward.” 

“Why?” 

“Well, as Mr. Smith pointed out 
some time ago, the escape velocity 

IF 



36 




of this asteroid is about one foot 
a second. 1 don^t know too much 
about guns^ but I seem to recall 
that an ordinary pistol shot will 
provide a spacesuited man with a 
recoil velocity of around a third 
of that. You wouldn’t be kicked en- 
tirely into space, but you’d be some 
time coming down; and just think 
of the embarrassment if your first 
shot had missed me. Don’t say I 
didn’t warn you.” 

He clamped down his own hel- 
met without waiting for an answer 
from either man. Then he wished 
he’d mentioned something about the 
danger to a spacesuit from rico- 
chet, but decided that it would be 
an anticlimax. 

T Te would have liked to hear the 

^ remarks passed between them, 
but he had already discovered that 
Robinson hadn’t wasted time cut- 
ting out his transmitter but avoid- 
ing the receiver. He had simply de- 
powered the whole unit, and Mac 
could neither transmit nor re- 
ceive. 

He stepped — using the word 
loosely — in the inner-lock door, 
hit the switch that opened it and 
stepped through. Turning to see 
whether Jones was with him, he was 
surprised to discover that the lat- 
ter still had not donned his helmet 
and was engaged in an animated 
discussion with Smith. 

Hoerwitz sometimes spoke on im- 
pulse, but it had been well over 



fifty years since he had performed 
an important action on that basis; 
the mental machinery concerned 
was rather corroded. It might be 
possible to get the inner lock door 
closed and the air pumps started 
before either of the two men could 
reach the inner switch; if he could 
do that, it would give hint nearly 
two minutes start — quite long 
enough to disappear on the irregu- 
lar, harshly lit surface of the as- 
teroid. On the other hand,^if they 
stopped the cycle before the inner 
door was closed and the inside 
switch out of circuit, they would 
presumably shoot him on the spot. 

His spacesuit had the usual pro- 
visions for sealing small leaks, but 
it was by no means bullet-proof. 
He wished he had taken the time to 
make that remark about ricochet; 
it would apply well to the metal- 
walled chambers they were all 
standing in. Unfortunately the 
thieves might not think of that in 
time. 

Hoerwitz might, if given another 
minute or two to mull it over, have 
taken the chance on that much 
data; but before he made up his 
mind the conversation ended. Jones 
donned his helmet, safetied its 
clamps and looked toward the air- 
lock. At that same moment all three 
men suddenly realized that Smith 
and Jones were both out of touch 
with pushoff points. They were 
“standing” on the floor, of course, 
since they had been in the room 



BULGE 



37 




for some time and weighed several 
grams each; but that weight would 
not supply anything like the trac- 
tion needed to get them to the 
switch quickly. An experienced 
spaceman would have jumped hard, 
in any direction, and trusted to the 
next wall collision to provide 
steerage; but it had become per- 
fectly evident in the last couple of 
days that these men were not ex- 
perienced spacemen. Hoerwitz’s 
impulses broke free with an almost 
audible screech of metal on rust, 
and he slapped the cycling control. 

VII 

J ones had drawn his gun. He 
might have fired, but the ac- 
tion of drawing had spoiled his 
stance. Hoerwitz thought he had 
fired, but that the soimd failed to 
get through his suit; the bullet, if 
any, must have gone bouncing 
around the equipment room. The in- 
ner door was shut, and the red light 
indicated pump cycling before any 
really interesting details could be 
observed. 

The pumps took fifty seconds to 
get the pressure down, and the mo- 
tors ten more to get the outer door 
open. Hoerwitz would have been 
outside almost on the instant, but 
his low-gravity reflexes took over. 

One simply does not move rapidly 
in a place where the effort which 
would lift a man half a millimeter 
on Earth will give him escape ve- 



locity. This is true even when 
someone can be counted on to be 
shooting at you in the next minute 
or so; a person drifting helplessly 
out of touch with pushoff mass is a 
remarkably easy target. The idea 
was to get out of sight, rather than 
far away. 

The asteroid was not exactly 
porous — no one has found a po- 
rous body made of lava yet — but 
it was highly irregular from a few 
hundred million years of random 
collisions out beyond Mars. There 
were explosion pits and crevices 
from this source, and quite a few 
holes made by men in the days 
when the material of the body it- 
self had been used for conversion 
mass. 

There were plenty of nice, 
dark cracks and holes to hide in. 
Hoerwitz maneuvered himself into 
one of the former five yards from 
the airlock and vanished. 

He didn’t bother to look behind 
him. He neither knew nor cared 
whether they would follow. All 
things considered, they might not 
even try. However, they would very 
probably send out at least two men, 
one to hunt for the fictitious mir- 
ror and the other to guard the 
spaceship — not that they could 
guess, the old man hoped, what 
he intended to do about the latter. 

Both places — sub-Earth and its 
antipodes — were just where Hoer- 
witz wanted them to be; they 
were the spots where an unwarn- 



38 



IF 




ed space-walker would be in the 
greatest danger. 

However, the ship would be a 
refuge, if it were still there, and 
Hoerwitz wanted to get there be- 
fore any possible guard. He there- 
fore set out at the highest speed 
he could manage, climbing across 
the asteroid. 

It was like chimney-work in 
Earthly rock-climbing, simpler in 
one way because there was no sig- 
nificant weight. The manager was 
not really good at it, but presum- 
ably he was better than the others. 

Earth was overhead and slightly 
to the west — about as far as it 
ever got that way, seen from near 
the airlock. That meant that time 
was growing short. When the plan- 
et started eastward again the as- 
teroid was within a hundred de- 
grees or so of perigee — an arc 
which it would cover in little over 
three-quarters of an hour, at this 
end of its grossly eccentric orbit. 

Travel grew more complicated, 
and rather more dangerous, as the 
planet sank behind him. Roche’s 
limit for a body of this density 
was at around twelve thousand 
miles from Earth’s center, and the 
tidal bulge — invisible, imponder- 
able, a mere mathematical quirk of 
earth’s potential field — was not 
only swinging around but growing 
stronger. With Earth, now spanning 
more than thirty degrees of sky, 
on the horizon behind him he was 
safe, but as it sank he knew he 



was traveling to meet the bulge, an3 
it was coming to meet him. He had 
to get to the ship before the field 
had been working on that area too 
long. 

The last thousand feet should 
have been the hardest, with his 
weight turning definitely negative; 
physically, it turned out to be the 
easiest, though the reason shocked 
him. He discovered, by the simple 
expedient of running into it, that 
the thieves had strung a cable be? 
tween their ship and the airlock. 

With its aid, they would travel 
much faster than he could. There 
might be a guard there already. 
Mac, terrified almost out of his 
senses, pulled himself along the 
cable with reckless haste until he 
reached a point where he could 
see the base of the ship a few hun- 
dred feet away. 

N o spacesuits were in sight, but 
the bottom of the globe was in 
black shadow. There was no way to 
be sure — except by waiting. That 
would eventually make one thing 
certain. The old man almost hurl- 
ed himself along the cable toward 
the ship, expecting every second to 
be his last, but trying to convince 
himself that no one was there. 

He was lucky. No one was. 

The ship was already off the 
“ground” by a foot or so; the tide 
was rising at this part of the as- 
teroid and weight had turned nega- 
tive. Hoerwitz crammed himself 



BULGE 



39 




into the space between the spheri- 
cal hull and the ground and heaved 
upward for all he was worth. 

At a guess, his thrust amounted 
to some fifty pounds. This gave 
him something over a minute before 
the vessel was too high for further 
pushing. In this time it had acquir- 
ed a speed of perhaps two inches 
a second relative to the asteroid; 
but this was still increasing, very 
slowly, under tidal thrust. 

The hull was of course covered 
with handholds. Hoerwitz seized 
two of these and rode upward with 
the vessel. It was quite true that 
a man drifting in space was an al- 
most hopeless proposition as far as 
search-and-rescue was concerned; 
but a ship was a very different 
matter. If he and it got far enough 
away before any of the others ar- 
rived, he was safe. 

Altitude increased with agonizing 
slowness. Earth’s bulk gradually 
came into view all around the 
planetoid’s jagged outline. At first, 
the small body showed almost 
against the center of the greater 
one; then, as the ship in its larger, 
slower orbit began to fall behind, 
the asteroid appeared to drift to- 
ward one side of the blue-and- 
white streaked disk. Hoerwitz 
watched with interest and apprecia- 
tion — - it was a beautiful sight — 
but didn’t neglect the point where 
the cable came around the rocks. 

He was perhaps five hundred 
feet up when a spacesuited figure 



IF 





appeared, pulling itself along with 
little appearance of haste. It was 
not yet close enough for the ship’s 
former site to be above the ‘‘hori- 
zon.” Mac waited with interest to 
see what the reaction to the dis- 
covery would be. 

It was impressive, even under 
circumstances which prevented good 
observation. The thief was surpris- 
ed enough to lose grip on the ca- 
ble. 

He was probably traveling above 
escape velocity, or what would have 
been escape velocity, even if the 
tide had been out. As it was, any 
speed would have been too great. 
For a moment, Hoerwitz thought 
the fellow was doomed. 

Maybe it was Robinson, though; 
at least, he reacted promptly and 
sensibly. He drew a gun and be- 
gan firing away from the asteroid. 
Each shot produced only a tiny 
velocity change in his drifting body, 
but those few inches a second were 
enough. He collided with one of the 
structures at the base of a radiator, 
kicked himself off and downward 
as he hit it, touched the surface, 
and clutched frantically at some 
handhold Hoerwitz couldn’t see. 
Then he began looking around and 
promptly discovered the ship. 

T he manager was quite sure the 
fellow wouldn’t try a jump. He 
wished, once again, that his radio 
receiver was worldng — the man 
might be saying something inter- 



BULGE 



41 




esting, though he must be out of 
radio reach of the others. It would 
be nice to know whether the thief 
could see Hoerwitz’s clinging fig- 
ure on the ship’s hull. It was possi- 
ble, since the lower side of the 
sphere was illuminated by Earth- 
light, but far from certain, since the 
man’s line of sight extended quite 
close to the sun. He wasn’t shoot- 
ing. But it was more than likely 
that his gun was empty anyway. 

It was disappointing in a way, 
but Hoerwitz was able to make up 
for himself a story of what the fel- 
low was thinking, and this was 
probably more fun than the real 
facts. Eventually the figure worked 
its way back to the cable and start- 
ed along it toward the airlock to a 
couple of holds with the snap-rings 
on his suit, and relaxed. 

There was nothing more to do. 
The drifting vessel would be spotted 
in the next hoiu: or so, if it hadn’t 
been already, and someone would be 
along. In a way, it was a disap- 
pointing ending. 

He spent some of the time won- 
dering what Shakespeare would 
have done to avoid the anticlimax. 
He might have learned, if he had 



stayed awake, but he slept through 
the interesting part. 

Smith, upon hearing that the 
ship was drifting away, had made 
the best possible time to the radia- 
tor site. Knowing that there was no 
other hope^ he jumped; and not 
being a lightning calculator able to 
make all the necessary allowances 
for the local quirks in the poten- 
tial field, he naturally went slightly 
off course. 

He used all but one of his buUets 
in attempted corrections and 
woimd up drifting at a velocity 
very well matched with that of the 
ship, but about fifty yards away 
from it. He could see Hoerwitz 
plainly. 

Up to that time he had had no 
intention either of harming the old 
man fatally or blowing up the sta- 
tion; but the realization that the 
manager had had a part in the loss 
of his ship changed his attitude 
drastically. When the police ship 
arrived, he was still tr3dng to de- 
cide whether to fire his last buUet 
at Hoerwitz, or in the opposite di- 
rection. Hoerwitz himself, of course, 
was asleep.

IF • Short Story 



DREAM STREET 

by C. C. MacAPP 



To dream? Aye, f here's the rubl For in 
that dream, what things may come . 



H enry Traum stepped off the Ave- 
nue Of Foreigners into a Httle- 
used native pedestrian way, paused, 
glancing around uneasily, then hur- 
ried on. Not that there was any 
specific danger that he knew of, but 
he’d been on Glyne only a few 
days, and the natives — solemn squat 
bipeds with hairless gray skins and 
unblinking goafs-eyes that reminded 
him, somehow, of human mythology 
— made him nervous. The walkway, 
between windowless back walls of 
four-story wooden buildings, was al- 
ready in gloom. The waning light 
from the greenish sky worsened his 
disquiet. 

The murmur of motor-traffic 
dwindled behind him, and now he 
heard the sounds of the seedy ba- 
zaar — the monotonous staccato 
whistle of a sweetmeat-peddler’s 
wagon, the chant of an auctioneer 
selling over-used native females, the 
dismal lowing of a draft beast, the 



peculiar ululating music of a drug- 
carousel, where the natives inhaled 
^eyn, which did strange things to 
them and to some off-worlders. Al- 
ready, he could smell the musty-hay 
odor of the keyn. He’d tried the 
merry-go-round; it had made him 
dizzy and a little drunk, but nothing 
more. Tonight he was bent upon a 
different diversion — one he’d dis- 
covered only the night before, and 
which pulled him back irresistibly 
now. 

A native policeman watched him 
with fixed, expressionless eyes as he 
emerged into the. queasy purple light 
of the district and huiri^ past the 
carousel, about which a dozen na- 
tives wandered crookedly, still under 
the spell of the last ride. The auc- 
tioneer paused in his chant and called 
out in singsong Low Glynic, vowing 
that the native women could do 
something incredible to such as 
Henry. The battered females on the 



43 



stand chuckled coarsely. Henry ignor- 
ed them. 

The small shack, down at the 
nearly deserted, poorly lighted end of 
the street, was dark. Henry’s heart 
quirked anxiously at the thought that 
the proprietor might already be gone. 
Breathing with a little difficulty, he 
approached and knocked timidly on 
the featureless solid hardwood door. 

Moments dragged. Finally there 
was the scrape of a bar being with- 
drawn, and the door swung inward. 
Henry peered at the proprietor in the 
dark office. 

The shop-owner wasn’t native — 
in fact, he might have passed for 
human, allowing for an odd elonga- 
tion like an El Greco painting, and 
pointed, tufted ears. His face was 
thin and swarthy, his eyes cynical. He 
said boredly, “Closed for the day.” 
His English was thickly accented but 
understandable. 

Henry said, “I — I couldn’t come 
any earlier. Could you possibly . 
rU pay double!” 

The swarthy humanoid made a 
cynical Levantine shrug, but pulled 
the door wider. “As you wish. But 
only a half-hour.” 

Ihe office was sparsely furnished 
with a desk, two chairs, and a mas- 
sive ornately-decorated steel strong- 
box. Henry fumbled in his sleeveless 
jacket for his wallet; he extracted na- 
tive currency of coarse reed-paper, 
and waited for the proprietor to de- 
posit it in the strongbox and re-lock 
that. The alien moved toward a door 
at the rear of the office, and Henry 
followed. 

There was a corridor with four 
stall-doors, each of thick hardwood 

44 



studded with big iron nail-heads. The 
proprietor went to the one at the 
end, near the barred door that open- 
ed to the dark alley behind the shack, 
pressed an alien-looking light-stud, 
and reached up to swing aside a 
hinged wooden port-cover at about 
face height in the stall door. Light — 
saffron, not purple — glowed from 
the uncovered port. 

Henry craned his neck to see the 
image relayed by a set of opposed 
mirrors inside the port. 

T he dream-sloth — Henry’s name 
for the creature, though it 
looked as cnuch like an oversized 
honey-bear as a sloth — was curled 
up in a ball on its sleeping-pad at 
the rear of the narrow chamber. It 
stirred uneasily in the light, then 
lifted a head to peer toward the 
door. Henry heard its shackles rattle. 

The proprietor, satisfied that the 
beast was securely chained, took a 
large hammered-iron key from his 
pocket and unlocked the stall door, 
then stood aside for Henry to enter. 

Henry said timidly, “Could — 
could I have the same dream as last 
night? It was — I can’t remember 
more than a shred or two, but — ” 
The swarthy alien shrugged cynical- 
ly. “That is beyond my control. 
Neither I nor the beast chooses the 
dream — the dream comes from 
your own mind — the buried part 
or the conscious part, or both. If 
your dream last night was ecstatic, 
you are probably of a happy nature. 
Some are sadists, some masochists; 
but that has nothing to do with me 
nor with my beasts. They merely will 
you to dream.” 



IF 




Henry, muttering uncertainly, 
stepped through the door. 

There was an inner doorway — 
with no door in it — offset from 
the outer one, so that he had to zig- 
zag in. That brought him in sight 
of the beast. 

The creature still huddled on its 
pad, its head lifted ahd turned toward 
the door. As Henry entered, it voiced 
a low querulous protest, as if it had 
already done a hard day’s work and 
dreaded more; the mesmerism or 
whatever it was, as Henry knew from 
the scant literature he’d been able to 
find, was an exhausting effort for the 
beasts. 

Henry lay down on the mattress 
provided for clients, his face turned 
toward the beast. It writhed unwilling- 
ly, its small eyes seeming to plead. 
But suddenly sparks crackled from 
the metal collar around its neck — 
part of a tight harness and the 
creature jerked and whimpered in 
pain. Wearily, trembling, it heaved 
itself to a squat and faced Henry. 
Henry winced. He thought the pro- 
prietor might have been a little less 
impatient in dealing punishment. 

He tried to relax his muscles, but 
they were taut, trembling with an- 
ticipation for the dream he couldn’t 
remember. He waited, eyes on the 
beast. It was about the size of a 
grown black bear, but gray rather 
than black, and as he’d noted on 
the previous night, rather bearlike in 
shape. But its eyes held no fierceness. 
The teeth were herbivorous, the 
claws small and blunt. Of course! 
What need has such a creature for 
physical weapons? All it needed was 
to lock eyes once with an enemy — 



a predator, for instance — and the 
enemy would go wandering off> 
wrapped in some blissful or fierce or 
frightened dream that had no re- 
lationship to its actual surroundings. 

He stared into the beasfs forlorn 
eyes, shaking with anticipation. He 
heard the port-cover close. Privacy, 
of course, had to be guaranteed. 

Instantly, with the closing of the 
port-cover, the beast’s attitude chang- 
ed. Gone was the pitiful cowering. 
Quickly — but not so quickly as to 
rattle the chains aloud — it twisted 
and nosed under a corner of its sleep- 
ing-pad; with awkward forepaws it 
raked out a key — smaller than the 
one to the stall door, more sophisti- 
cated, as if of a hi^er technology. 
Clumsily, holding the key between 
both forepaws, the beast tossed it 
toward Henry. Slurred speech came 
from its mouth. 

H enry gaped. He knew the beasts 
were intelligent enough for crude 
speech of some sort — but English? 
A sudden thought hit him. He pinch- 
ed his left arm, on the inside just 
above the elbow. It hurt. This was no 
dream, then! 

“Please!” the creature mouthed. 
“You — kind. Help me — escape. 
I — I go with you, be slave! I work! 
I bring — money. I give you — 
dreams! Always, dreams! I want — 
kind master. Please!” 

Henry struggled into a sitting po- 
sition. He was badly shaken. “I — 
but we can’t! We’re locked in!” 
“No!” the beast pleaded. “Doia: 
not lock. This key — take off chains. 
Please! I — suffer.” It gestured with 
a paw at the leek on its harness,

hdd in place on its back where the 
be^ couldn’t reach it, “Owner — 
gone back to woman. Not come back 
— yeti” 

Henry stared for a minute into the 
creature’s pleading eyes. Why — he 
wondered suddenly — need it beg? 
Why didn’t it simply put him into a 
dream where — But, no. The owner 
had told him the beast could not 
choose the dream. 

Slowly, shakily, he reached for the 
key; he sat holding it in limp fingers 
while he stared at the beast. The 
misery and hope in the small eyes 
brought a wave of pity over him — 
not unmixed with a certain amount 
of greed. 

Hastily now, he scrambled to 
his feet and stepped toward the 
beast He grasped the harness-lock, 
inserted the key, and turned it. The 
lock sprang open. He tried the key 
in the leg-shackles and found that it 
worked. The creature shook off the 
bonds with a little sigh of relief. 
Henry began to offer the key to the 
beast, then realized that the paws 
couldn’t grasp it and thrust it into 
his own pocket. 

He paused at the outer door of 
the stall, listening. The only sound, 
other than the thumping of his own 
pulse, was the faint noise of the 
bazaar up the street. He pushed open 
the door, peered into the corridor, 
and stepped out The beast brushed 
softly against his thigh as it came 
out silently and lithely. 

Henry turned uncertainly toward 
the door into the office. 

“No!” the beast mouthed softly. 
“Back door. Wait! I go first — see 
safe.” 



H enry, confused, hesitated. The 
creature rose on its haunches, 
deftly pushed the bar aside with one 
forepaw, nosed open the door, and 
was gone into the darkness. 

Henry waited, his eyes swinging 
nervously from the back door to the 
office door. Minutes passed, then 
more minutes, and a painful realiza- 
tion began to steal over Henry. He 
stepped to the back door, pushed it 
open a crack and peered out. 

Night was complete now. Dimly, 
he could make out lightless shacks, 
two or three alleys of them and, 
beyond, at the edge of town, the 
irregular black line of the forest. 

The dream-sloth was gone, of 
course. 

More hurt than angry, he moved 
hastily toward the office door. 

When he was two paces away, the 
door burst open and the suspicious 
face of the proprietor poked through. 
Henry saw the cynical eyes dart to 
the open door of the stall, then to the 
alley-door. A swarthy hand swept 
downward and came up holding an 
alien but recognizable pistol. 

Henry did not even think of trying 
to escape via the back door — the 
single glimpse of the darkness there 
had repelled him. Instead, he lurched 
toward the swarthy alien, grabbed for 
the gun-hand, and tried to twist 
around and get by into the office. 
The lean alien was as wiry as a 
coyote. They grappled there, Henry 
trying desperately to keep the gun 
pointed away from himself, the pro- 
prietor trying to wrench free. 

The gun went off. Henry felt the 
searing muzzle-blast on his cheek 
and heard glass crash somewhere. 

IF 



46 




The gun went off again. Then there 
was a third blasts and Henry’s head 
seemed to explode. He heard, as if 
from a distance, his own stunned 
grunt as he fell; he knew, dimly, 
that he struck the floor hard and lay 
there . • . 

H enry came to slowly, conscious 
of voices raised excitedly some- 
where. He pushed his shoulders and 
chest from the floor and rested a 
moment until more strength returned 
to his body. He shook his head, trying 
to clear it, felt gingerly the still- 
oozing superficial wound over one 
temple, then climbed unsteadily to 
his feet. 

His eyes roved and discovered the 
body of the swarthy customer on 
the floor, a pool of already-congealing 
blood near the head. He stared stupid- 
ly at it for a moment, then jerked 
his head around to look at the alley 
door. It was unbarred and ajar. He 
darted a look at the last stall door 
and saw that it was also unlocked. 
Heart pounding, he staggered toward 
it. He saw that the outer mirror of 
the periscope-arrangement was smash- 
ed. He knew, then, that one of his 
dream-beasts was gone. 

He lurched over to the body and 
only then saw the pistol — his own 
pistol — half-hidden beneath it. 

Desperately — aware of the ex- 
cited voices outside the front of the 
shop — he tried to think. This was 
the same alien customer who’d come 
here last night. Had he come again 
tonight? Had there been an argu- 
ment of some sort? 

The dream-beast, he had no doubt, 
was responsible somehow. Maybe it 



had broken the mirror; waited there 
for him to open the port and had 
locked eyes directly with him. Or — . 

He cried out suddenly and clasped 
both hands to his head, ignoring 
his wound, half-insane with con- 
fusion. His dream-beast? 

Groaning, mouthing incoherently, 
he staggered into the office, sat down 
at the desk and let his head fall on 
it. Confusion . Confusion . 
Two sets of memoriesi In each he 
was Henry Traum. But in one he’d 
come to Glyne only days ago, had 
discovered the dream-shop and tried 
it, and had struggled distractedly 
through the obligations of the next 
day and hurried to the shop again. 
He had heard the dream-sloth {dead 
with him in English ... In the other 
set of memories, he was the proprie- 
tor! He had been on Glyne over a 
year — a fugitive criminal from 
Earth via other places — and had 
imported the dream-beasts . 

Wildly, he lifted his head to stare 
at the front door, beyond which the 
voices were now louder and nsore 
excited. What had he done? What 
had the beast done? Maybe not 
everything he’d believed about the 
beasts had been accurate. Or maybe 
they learned, developed new powers 
when with intelligent beings . 

One thing he could not deny — 
both sets of memories were equally 
clear, running back to childhood. 
Both coincide up to a time a few 
years back, then diverged, in detail. 

One was false. But which one? 

Then he heard the voices of na- 
tive police outside the door. One of 
them banged on it, with a gun-butt.

FLESH AND THE IRON 

by LARRY S. TODD 

Illustrated by TODD 



One neecfecf parts and one hunted skulls. 
Together they found what neither wanted. 



I 

TiiTarigold stepped cautiously jdong 
■LVJL the ledge, one hand tightly 
gripping his great shol-wood bow, the 
other holding his three gaily-painted 
trophy skulls away from his chest 
plates. The skulls tockled hollowly 
against one another but made no oth- 
er sound. 

He stopped and stared out across 
the scrub-jungle, straining his tele- 
scopic lenses and infrared pickups 
for a glance of Flesh, but none of 



the elusive creatures were to be seen, 
which was not to say that none were 
watching him. Slowly Marigold began 
inching along the limestone l^ge 
again, but paid little attention to the 
pebbles rolling beneath his plastic 
feet till he nearly slipped and fell. 

Raucous colors dancing across the 
semaphore in his face and motors 
whining nervously, he jerked himself 
back to safety. Cautiously looking 
over the ledge, he reflected ruefully 
upon his unparalleled ability to strand 
himself out on high, narrow ledges. 



50 






Then, shrugging to adjust the quiver 
of arrows on his back, he took out 
along the ledge again. 

It dropped rapidly, then, and Mar- 
igold had a difficult time retaining 
his balance. Finally he decided to be 
safe rather than dead and took the 
remaining hundred feet very slowly, 
avoiding any large rocks which could 
scratch his armor. The Mill was al- 
ways very touchy about scratched 
plating. 

Attaining the ground safely. Mari- 
gold gave the landscape another quick 
scan to assure himself that no Resh 
lurked nearby. Small and soft as they 
were, they could still be very fast and 
very nasty. The first Flesh whose 
ski^ Marigold had taken had chosen 
to vent his pleasure at being cap- 
tured by swinging a heavy club at 
Marigold’s right leg and relieving 



him of the responsibility thereof. 
The Mill had been so displeased 
about having to replace the leg that 
she demanded he hunt down a skull 
for her in payment, to be kept in her 
private treasury. So, though three 
skulls hung on Marigold’s chest, he 
had actually slain four Flesh. 

The vista seemed harmless, so the 
robot cast off into the bushes, head- 
ing for a distant blue ridge where a 
team of Flesh had been reported." 

Marigold was on the hunt. 

He was uncertain whether it would 
prove to be a fruitful hunt, for his 
past three had been blanks. He had 
not so much as even seen a Flesh. 
Nor had many of his Mill-brethren; 
their hunts were bringing in sparse 
returns, too. For a while there had 
been quite a few Flesh about; not 
only the number of new skulls but 



FLESH AND THE IRON 



51 




the amount of Mill-Brethren who 
never returned indicated this. But the 
days were getting lean, and more and 
more hunters returned without skulls 
and even without scratches to show 
they had met or seen a Flesh. 

I t was hard to say whether the Mill 
was pleased or not by this. The 
great metal and plastic behemoth, a 
large dark cube with dozens of little 
stalls and incomprehensible machin- 
ery inside, had been uncommunica- 
tive recently, and if she spoke at all, 
it was usually petulant nagging about 
inconsequential subjects. As often as 
not, her anger was directed at Mari- 
gold The replacement leg had caused 
her to label him as careless. 

At first, all she had ever given 
him was a scolding, but every time 
he returned with scratches, she cut 
into him anew, till extreme embar- 
rassment had caused him to take 
longer and longer hunting trips. These 
week-long forays never amounted to 
anything, but at least they kept the 
critical speakers of the Mill at a 
comfortable distance. He dreaded the 
day when she would take to com- 
plaining about their length. 

As he strolled through the gorse, 
tpirror-bright armor flickering in the 
sun, he became nervously aware of 
how late in the afternoon it was. Late 
afternoon was not a good time to be 
abroad, for Flesh could lurk behind 
sun-warmed rocks and never have 
their body heat give them away, and 
the gentle breezes that blew across 
the plain rattled the bushes much 
more than any smart Flesh would. 
Even their beige-pink bodies matched 
the color of the dried grasses and 



bushes, and Marigold knew all toO 
well that one could be behind him at 
that very moment, club held high. 

He checked, and finding nothing 
there, decided to make sure it stayed 
that way. He increased his pace till 
he was moving at a rapid walk, al- 
most a jog. 

But not for long; for he was over 
ei^t feet tall and clearly visible for 
miles, and his heavy tread made him 
think uncomfortably about Flesh put- 
ting their ears to the ground and 
hearing him coming. 

The brush got thicker and Mari- 
gold became painfully cognizant of 
the tremendous rustling and scraping 
he made as he forced himself through 
the dry bushes. A quick look back 
showed him a trail a blind Flesh 
could follow with a walking-stick, to 
beat him to extinction with the stick. 
He looked around him, motors 
whining high and shrill, and all his 
relays on the verge of tripping. He 
forgot about the ridge and just ran 
off, feeling the eyes of all the Flesh 
in creation on his back, casting lots 
for his radar antenna and listening 
to the music of his newly-squeaking 
hip and his violent crashing through 
the furze. Almost on the verge of 
panic, he dashed through the thick- 
ets and nearly fell into a small 
stream. With a sudden internal splap 
all his systems shut down to clear his 
brain for dealing with this new ob- 
stacle. All of this took less than a sec- 
ond but was enough time for the 
Flesh sitting across the stream to 
leap into frantic activity. 

T he Iron had crept up on him so 
silently, yet so fast, that Locker 



52 



IF 




Bannock was almost caught dead. But 
the thing just stood there dumbly, so_ 
he grabbed his hook-club and raced 
in on the machine, screaming at it to 
confuse it. 

The Iron jerked convulsively as 
Bannock cleared the stream; moving 
with stupid slowness, it tried to strike 
him with a great rubber hand. The 
hook-spike on Bannock’s club tore 
into the hand and cut through it, but 
caught. The arm followed through 
with its swing and tore the club from 
his grasp. Howling in terror, he dove 
for it and caught it just as the Iron 
reached out for and gripped his 
ankle. 

The Flesh and the Iron were both 
stretched out along the 'ground, both 
somewhat stunned and both ultimate- 
ly captured. 

Bannock twisted himself about for 
a better look at his captive captor, 
who tightened the grip on his ankle 
till the man hissed and turned red in 
the face. Marigold recognized a red 
semaphore signal as meaning annoy- 
ance, so he loosened his grip. Ban- 
nock looked at him and thought furi- 
ously. 

So the Iron could break his leg. 
The creature was stretched out along 
the ground as he was, so at least it 
couldn’t bang him around against 
anything. If he sacrificed his ankle 
he could stave in its head. 

Marigold stared thoughtfully at the 
Flesh, wholly aware of this possibil- 
ity and not wanting to tempt fate. He 
recalled that his first Flesh had fought 
very creditably with a broken arm 
and leg. Flesh and Iron watched each 
other for a long time. 

Finally the Flesh shrugged and be- 



gan to pull himself erect. With a 
crackle of alarm from his speaker. 
Marigold gripped the ankle tighter, 
and the Flesh’s face twisted and con- 
torted. 

“Stop!” he cried. “I’m only sitting 
up!” Marigold hesitantly relaxed his 
grip, but did not release the Flesh. 
“You sit up too,” said the Flesh, 
and Marigold obliged him, since the 
order seemed as good an idea as any. 

n 

F or five minutes more they sat that 
way, silently musing one another 
and considering the ridiculous situa- 
tion they now found themselves in. 
The Resh could swing his club and 
crush Marigold’s good arm before it 
could squeeze his ankle, but the lame 
left arm was still a formidable blud- 
geon. 

“Well, shall we sit here all after- 
noon or shall we be about our busi- 
ness and try to kill one another?” 
asked the Flesh, and he spat into the 
dust. 

Being at a loss for words. Mari- 
gold did not reply. 

The Flesh spoke again. “I see 
you’re a three-skull iron. I’m a four 
tenna man myself.” He swung a neck- 
lace out of his tunic and displayed 
the four reception cones strung on a 
leather thong. Marigold could think 
of only one way that the Flesh could 
have gotten those antennae. 

“You have . stopped . four 
Mill-brethren?” 

“That what you call each other? 
Yeh. I have. Five, actually, but I 
never did claim that fifth tenna 
’cause a few of your Mill brethren 



FLESH AND THE IRON 



53 




were coming up fast. Discretion is 
better than valor.” 

“I have stopped four Flesh, but I 
paid one skull to the Mill for a new 
leg.” 

Bannock suddenly grinned, his 
fancy struck by the way in which he 
and his mortal enemy were compar- 
ing hunting records. ITien he scowled, 
for his present situation held little 
possibility for humor and levity. He 
examined the broken arm of Mari- 
gold, then plucked a small leather 
pouch from his bandolier and be- 
gan to eat something. “You inter- 
rupted my dinner. Iron,” he ac- 
cused. 

Marigold watched the Flesh stuff 
the crumbly brown cakes into the 
large aperture in his head, and felt 
obliged to say something. He winced 
inside, for this was an extremely em- 
barrassing position to be in. If the 
Mill ever heard of it . 

“What are you doing, Flesh?” 
“The name’s Locker Bannock . 
call me Bannock. I’m eating.” 
“You’re . eating?” 

“Yeah.” He looked sharply at 
Marigold’s impassive features search- 
ing for expression. “Doing my equiv- 
alent to what you do when you fill 
yourself up with water. Only I have 
to do it a lot oftener than you. I 
haven’t any fusion plant inside of 
me.” 

“What is a fusion plant?” 

“You, Iron, have carried a fusion 
plant around inside of you since you 
... all your so-called life, and you 
don’t know what it is?” 

“i have never even heard of a fu- 
sion plant. I do not know what is 
inside of me — only the Mill knows.” 



“The Mill! You Iron are like little 
ants,” Bannock muttered, for the 
edification of nobody in particular. 
“You even have a Queen. Ah, fist” 
He finished eating, wiped his mouth 
with the back of his hand and rolled 
over toward the robot. “Okay. I’ll 
explain what’s inside of you.” 

H e took a sharp stone and began 
scratching little diagrams on the 
surface of a flat rock, expounding up- 
on the contents of Marigold’s chest, 
head and limbs. As he spoke, the Iron 
absent-mindedly let go his leg, but 
he quickly vetoed breaking away and 
trying to ambush Iron the next day. 
It could stHl strike out with that arm, 
catch him with the other. He finished 
the lecture. 

“I don’t think it will make any dif- 
ference, though.” 

Marigold did not know what to 
make of that statement. He said so. 

“What I meant,” explained Ban- 
nock, “was that even if you know 
how you work inside, you won’t 
really understand it. You’re not equip- 
ped with enough mental machinery. 
For example, do you know why the 
gears in your arm work?” 

‘They go around and around?” 
“You’re guessing and you’re 
wrong. That’s how they turn. WTiy do 
they turn? Because force is applied 
to them and they are anchored in a 
particular way. It sounds pretty ob- 
vious, but I don’t think you could 
really understand.” 

Marigold thought this over for a 
while, and agreed. But he added that 
only ihe Mill had to know, anyway. 

“Yeah,” muttered Bannock, and 
fell back to appraising his enemy. 



54 



IF 




It was getting quite late, and nei- 
ther had moved from where they 
were. The sun was sinking low to the 
western horizon, and the night in- 
sects were beginning to make their 
rounds. Bannock swatted one and 
broke into the customary cursing. 
Marigold flashed green upon his sem- 
aphore> and Bannock held up the 
corpse of the offending neocop. 

“Little Flesh, Iron. Pests.” He 
tossed the insect away and looked up 
at the robot again. 

“Iron, do you have a name or a 
serial number or something 1 can call 
you? You call me Bannock, I may as 
well call you something other than 
Iron.” 

“Yes. Marigold.” He tapped a 
small brass flower inset in the ID 
disk at the base of his neck. 

“Okay, Marigold, Fm getting cold 
— an unpleasant response to drop- 
ping temperature — and these bugs 
are eating me. Hadn’t we better go 
someplace where I can rest?” 

“Isn’t this place as good as any?” 
“No. For the reasons I outlined to 
you and others. Look, if you’re wor- 
ried I’m going to kill you by attack- 
ing your legs, I’m quite sure you 
could kill me while 1 did it to you. 
And I don’t know how fast and ac- 
curate you are with that bow and ar- 
row and I’ve no desire to find out. 
So come on ... ” 

Marigold did not move. 

‘fcome on, damn you!” 

Marigold remained motionless. 

“I’ll clobber you ...” 

TiyiTarigold jerked to his feet and 
iVJL poised to strike Bannock, but 
the human danced back a little and 



motioned for peace. The robot made 
no other move, other than to nock 
the arrow. Bannock looked at him. 

“Put that thing away,” he said. He 
was aware that he was as good as 
dead, but he poised his club. 

“I want your skull.” 

“That’s reasonable. I want your 
tenna.” 

“If you dove into the water and 
walked along under it, I could not 
see you to stop you.” 

“It’s not deep enough anyway. Put 
that thing away, will you? I don’t 
want to wreck your legs.” 

Bannock knew too clearly that if 
the Iron did not put away the bow 
and arrow, he would have very little 
chance indeed of even coming near 
him, but the Iron was either none too 
smart or quite careless and did 
not see this. The robot slowly loosed 
the tension on the bowstring and 
replaced the arrow. “We have cap- 
tured each other. Bannock. So that 
neither should escape from the other, 
let us bind each other to one another, 
and then go to your place to retire.” 
“Fm game. You have rope?” 
Marigold snapped open a little cab- 
inet in his metal belly and brought 
forth a long nylon cable. Bannock 
eyed it cautiously. 

“I’ll bet you can break it.” 

“I can’t, and you would know if 
I tried, anyway.” Marigold hooked 
the clip at one end into a buckle on 
his back, and tossed the other end to 
Bannock. 

Hand on club, the human tied it 
about his wrist, using a one-handed 
knot. “I’ll walk to one side of you 
— the left side, so you can’t grab the 
rope and rip off my right arm.” He 



FLESH AND THE IRON 



55 




pointed with the club at a nearby 
tumble of rocks. “There’s a cave over 
there. We’ll go to it.” 

Marigold didn’t care where they 
went, so long as it wasn’t into a trap. 
As they walked, he kept his radar 
antenna pointed at Bannock, for he 
didn’t want the Flesh to come at him 
suddenly, swinging the club and 
howling. But the Flesh kept its dis- 
tance, whether aware of the surveil- 
lance or not. 

Marigold reflected upon the Mill’s 
calling him careless and unobserv- 
ant and not very alert. He could easi- 
ly agree that he was not very alert, 
for he knew that the Flesh had ex- 
posed himself to dangerous situations 
quite frequently, and quite willing- 

ly- 

As he ran through his sensory 
memories, he located parts where the 
Flesh’s heartbeat had sped up tre- 
mendously, as though it was taking a 
terrible risk. And these times coin- 
cided with the times Marigold had 
not paid careful attention to what he 
was doing. But the Flesh had not 
made any dangerous moves. But 
granting that it recognized its chances 
and seemed aware that they came 
quite often, it was apparently playing 
a game with Marigold. You trust me 
and ril trust you. Marigold cautioned 
himself to watch for this; it could be 
some kind of a blind for future sneak 
attacks. 

Bannock saw the antenna swing to 
cover him, and knew that the Iron 
was not entirely as dumb as it had 
been trying to make him think it was. 
He would have to keep this act up 
for a couple of days to provide any 
positive results. 



HI 

T hey climbed a black tumble of 
basalt and granite and came to 
the cave, a fissure in the ground 
which widened into a chamber at 
the end. Bannock, after announcing 
that he was untying himself, retreat- 
ed to a dark comer of the cave, talk- 
ing all the while. 

“Marigold, shall we forget this 
rope business tomorrow? It’s a need- 
less precaution, since I couldn’t get 
very far from you and that bow. If 
you tried to break and run, I wouldn’t 
have much luck in stopping you. You 
weigh over a ton, which implies a lot.” 
“Very well, we will not use it.” 
Though Marigold recognized that he 
had given up a very good chance to 
catch the Flesh, simply by suddenly 
running over rough terrain, he deter- 
mined that two could play at the 
game of simulated honesty. 

Bannock came forth from the 
depths of the cave and dropped a 
load of dry wood on the floor. He lit 
it aflame and roasted his supper, a 
few chunks of meat from a leather 
pouch, and Marigold watched him 
dully. 

After a while, he stood and said, 
“We Flesh sleep — like recharging 
our capacitors or something. You 
know? Anyway while Fm sleeping 
you could kill me, so Fm going to 
climb down into that little hole over 
there, where you can’t reach me, and 
I’ll sleep there.” 

As he dropped down into the 
small-mouthed pit. Bannock watched 
the Iron. He worfdn’t leave during 
the night, unfortunately. He wanted 
his skull too much. 



FLESH AND THE IRON 



57 




The following morning Bannock 
lit his fire again and roasted his 
breakfast. Marigold sat impassively on 
a rock, lit by golden radiance from 
the morning sun. 

“Well, Marigold. It’s about time 
we determined what we’re going to 
do about each other. Any ideas?” 

“1 thought about it all last night. 
1 could think of but one thing. Since 
neither of us wants to let the other go, 
for the risk of ambush, all we can 
reasonably do is have our fight and 
let that decide who gets what.” 
Bannock’s heart leaped sickeningly. 
This was all he needed, since the 
broken arm could still kill him and 
the other was twice as deadly. He 
adopted a scorning manner. 

“Won’t work. I have an unfair ad- 
vantage. You got a busted arm.” 

“I can use it as a club.” 

Bannock closed his eyes painfully, 
then sat on a rock and glared at 
Marigold. “All right, all right. We’re 
both thinking the same thing. How do 
I get this guy to trust me enough for 
his guard to come down? No show- 
down, Marigold. Think again.” 

“We shall go to your settlement, 
and I will set you free.” 

“Huh?” 

“I will take you to your settlement, 
and bind you with the rope so you 
will not try to bushwhack me, and 
I will depart.” 

“You came on that idea mighty 
fast. Sure, you’ll escape, with my 
skull under your arm. The moment 
I drop my club you will swing that 
cleverly concealed knife — yes, I 
see it — and Til be dead. No dice.” 
Marigold’s semaphore filled with 
murkiness, and he strode silently out 



into the dayli^t to scan the morn- 
ing landscape. He was silent. 

"Marigold, try this adaptation of 
your plan. There’s this big plain; 
we will walk to the middle; you 
will give me your arrows, and 
I will carry them to one side; you 
will carry yourself to the other. 
When I get to my side I’ll put the 
arrows down and hightail it away. 
You can get them and not get bush- 
whacked. Follow me?” 

“No. What if you do not return 
my arrows?” 

Bannock spat into the dust. “Dumb 
Iron. How far do you think I could 
carry those arrows with you after 
me, and not expect to get caught? I 
don’t need them. I don’t have a bow, 
and if I put them down I could be 
a mile away before you got near.” 
Marigold grumbled blue on his 
semaphore, then asked, “Where is 
this plain you speak of?” 

“See that ridge way off that way?” 
Bannock pointed. “Behind that. My 
settlement is a dozen or so kilometers 
from it.” The last was untrue; his 
settlement was a good forty miles 
from the ridge, along it to the west, 
but there was no need in risking an 
armored attack of Iron against the 
town of Werser. 

They set out. 

L ater in the day. Marigold’s frac- 
tured arm began squeaking 
loudly and was becpming difficult 
for the Iron to move, up as far as the 
shoulder joint. He showed numerous 
signs of dismay but Bannock did not 
seem to notice anything until the 
squeaking got quite loud. 

“What’s the trouble?” 



58 



IP 




“The arm.” Marigold indicated thp 
afflicted member. ‘It’s hard to 
move.” 

“Oh, fist,” swore Bannock. “I 
should have expected that. Still I’m 
surprised it wasn’t a helluva lot 
worse. Or sooner.” 

“What is the matter?” 

“Lubrication. You Iron have a 
built-in lube system, like my blood 
vessels, except they’re not for lube. 
It keeps your joints moving smooth 
and silent.” 

Bannock fell behind the robot. 

“What can I do about it?” Mari- 
gold asked. 

“Nothing . except maybe hold 
that stump high in the air so you 
won’t lose any more lube.” 

Marigold lifted the broken limb, 
finding that it moved very stubbornly. 
He heard Bannock snicker with sub- 
dued laughter. A rather humiliating 
thing. Marigold decided, if the Flesh 
thought it was so funny — unless 
the laughter was only a trick to dis- 
tract him or put him off guard. Sev- 
eral times he considered swinging it 
down upon Bannock, but it firmly 
resisted all efforts to move it quickly; 
besides, the Flesh was smart and 
could be useful. 

Marigold endured the humiliation. 

“Marigold, what’s that up ahead?” 
Bannock pointed toward a hill, at the 
crown of which the scrub grew thin- 
ner. In the tawny grass and dry 
brown bushes something gleamed 
brightly. 

“A Mill-brother.” 

Bannock jerked uncomfortably, but 
Marigold was oblivious of this and 
went on describing what he saw. “He 
is — dead — that is the word, dead? 



He moves no more; in fact, I’d say 
he hasn’t done any moving for a good 
many sunnycyclqs now.” 

“You’re getting a wry, dry wit. 
Marigold. So he’s dead, eh? That 
solves two problems in one stroke.” 
“Eh? I can see that in his current 
state, he won’t come to my aid, but 
what is the other advantage?” 
“Fist, can’t you guess? It’s to your 
advantage. Head this way.” 

T he dead robot lay on the ground, 
parts of its stainless-steel plate 
worn off by weather to show the 
dusty yellow plastic beneath. There 
were lichens straggling up the side 
of its chest and head, and the recep- 
tion core of the antenna had been 
twisted off. The legs were crumpled, 
but aside from that, there seemed to 
be little damage. Bannock crouched 
next to the corpse and tapped it 
tightly with a pebble, listening to the 
clicks. Marigold began getting impa- 
tient and shifted about on his feet, till 
Bannock suddenly jerked. 

“Stop shifting about like that. I 
don’t know if you’ve got ideas on my 
head or not, but stop it, damnit!” 

“I wasn’t ...” 

Bannock cut Marigold’s defense 
short with a noncommital grunt and 
returned to tapping on the hulk. 
“What are you doing?” 

“Getting a new arm for you.” 
Bannock pried a panel from the 
back of the hulk, reached in, and 
tugged a little black box free from 
its position beneath the power plant. 
He undid a few snaps, opened it, and 
removed a handful of tools. 

‘Tt sure is a shame you Iron don’t 
know about all the go^es you have 



FLESH AND THE IRON 



59 




stashed away inside of you. A little 
fooling around with his insides would 
have had this fellow still alive today.** 
He paused to laugh sarcastically. 
“I’ll bet your mill doesn’t even know 
she puts them inside of you. Sid- 
down.” 

Marigold sat, and Bannock crit- 
ically eyed the min of his arm. After 
cautioning the Iron against any sud- 
den moves, he attached the elbow 
joint of the corpse with several of the 
tools. It fell away, and Bannock be- 
gan performing the same operation 
on Marigold. The Iron twitched nerv- 
ously and received a reverberating 
slam against his side with the wrench. 
“Stay still, damn your hide,” growled 
Bannock. Marigold’s arm fell off, and 
Bannock took the other and wrestled 
it into place. A few left motions 
with his wrench, a snap connection of 
some of the little tubes, pressure 
splices applied to the cables, and the 
arm was on. 

“Try it out.” 

“It squeaks.” 

“Your lube system will take care 
of that pretty soon. It’s in perfectly 
good condition itself. That hulk might 
have been dead, but all his parts 
were still sealed tight away. Every- 
thing above his hip-joint was in top- 
flight condition.” 

Marigold grunted with his sema- 
phore, then stood up. 

“Very good, Marigold,” Bannock 
commented. “You didn’t try to kill 
me right off or anything. Shall we go 
on our way?” 

“It’s getting late. You may want 
to sleep soon, am I wrong? And make 
your fire and cook your food?” 

“You may be right,” Bannock 



agreed, and began to gather dry 
wood. He brought it to a small hol- 
low which was surrounded by tall 
trees, and there he cooked his supper. 

IV 

M arigold watched disconsolately, 
unable to direct his thoughts 
upon any one subject. He tried to 
think of new ways in which he could 
kill Bannock, but none came to his 
mind. The Flesh just seemed to know 
so damn much. 

“Bannock?” 

“Grnnnch?” 

“How is it that you know so much 
about Iron?” 

“I’m a junkman, if that means any- 
thing to you. No? Well, suppose some 
hunter comes in with a dead Iron, 
pulling it on a little cart or some- 
thing, and he wants to use it for a 
servant or a farm laborer or sell it. 
Someone has to fix the Iron, and 
since most hunters are rather unre- 
markable as brains go, it won’t be 
the hunter who does it. I do. Re- 
member that dead Iron we saw to- 
day? Given a few weeks I could have 
him running again. I studied your 
anatomy for six years and I’m pretty 
sure I could make one of you from 
scrap parts alone. And hell ... I 
think it’s pretty obvious that I know 
more about you than your Mill does.” 
“I doubt it,” Marigold replied 
stuffily. 

“Doubt it if you want.” 

“If you know so much about us, 
why are you out hunting us like those 
stupid hunters?” 

Bannock broke out laughing, rock- 
ed back and forth, and gasped, “If 



60 



IF 




you’re so smart why ain’t you rich?” 
He stifled the chuckling. “Never ex- 
^ pected to get that from an Iron.” 
Marigold blinked his semaphore in 
puzzlement. 

“Well, Marigold, I’m out here 
hunting because I need spare parts. 
1 don’t come out here to hunt for 
Iron like you, still up and kicking. I 
look for ones like your benefactor 
back there. Use them in my shop.” 
Marigold sat on his tree-stump, ban- 
nock disturbed him a great deal, for 
he knew the man was smarter than he 
was, and quite a bit more self-confi- 
dent, seeming to know an infinity of 
facts. The self-confidence disturbed 
him especially, for the Flesh could be 
leading him right into a trap and 
wouldn’t let loose a peep. Still, there 
had been plenty of times when Ban- 
nock could have dispatched Mari- 
gold, and he had not taken advantage 
of them. Marigold wasn’t so sure any 
more that this trustworthiness was so 
much a game on Bannock’s part. It 
seemed to come so naturally to the 
Flesh. Still . Marigold squelched 
his thoughts and watched the fire 
burn. Bannock slept through the night 
high in a thick-trunked tree. 

* ^T^he first sunbeams of dawn sent 
A the bugs fleeing over his face, 
and seeking refuge in his ears and 
nose, so Bannock spluttered awake, 
climbed back down the tree, and 
saw Marigold exactly as he had left 
him — hunched over on the stump 
looking at the ashes of the bumt-out 
fire. ITie Iron turned when Bannock 
landed in the shadowed turf. 

“You slept all night.” 

“Right you are. Help me gather 



some firewood?” Presently a small 
fire was roasting Bannock’s bre^- 
fast, and Marigold watched, as dis- 
consolate as ever. As the human ate, 
he spoke to the machine. “Have you 
decided to let me carry your arrows 
across the clearing?” 

“Yes. You may as well.” 

“Good.” Bannock opened a case 
from his bandolier and began shav- 
ing and trimming his sandy mustache. 
As he did, he asked, “Marigold, why 
do you Iron hunt men?” 

“Men?” 

“Flesh, then. Why?” 

“Oh. Because you hunt us.” 
“Well, then, why do you wear our 
skulls as ornaments?” 

“Prestige, of course. To show we 
have adequately defended the home 
Mill.” 

“Reasonable. That’s why we wear 
the receptors of your tennas — to 
show we’ve kept the Iron away from 
our settlementsii The more we wear 
around our necks, the bigger and hair- 
ier and stronger we look in the eyes 
of the girls. It’s good for social re- 
lations to be able to be dangerous.” 
He swore when he cut a nick out of 
his lower lip. “Anyway, we could 
probably wipe a lot of you Iron out, 
if you weren’t so useful.” 

Marigold didn’t like that statement 
and let Bannock know. 

“I don’t care if you don’t like it. 
Marigold. It happens to be true. If 
I know so almighty much about your 
insides, doesn’t it indicate to you that 
I can pull a few wires in you and 
make your fusion plant cut loose all 
over the countryside? No. Of course 
you don’t know. Anyway forget it. 
We don’t wipe you all out because 



FLESH AND THE IRON 



61 




there aren’t enough of us to do the 
job right and there are still too damn 
many of you.” 

“You threw a few words at me I 
don’t know. Girls?” 

“You’ve got a lot of questions. 
Marigold.” Bannock gnawed at a fin- 
gernail. “But then you’ve got a hell- 
uva lot to learn. All right. What is 
there to life, for one of you Iron?” 
“Why • . uh . hunting, and 
seeing that the Mill ...” 

“Has a lot of metal-bearing rocks 
in her belly so she can make more 
Iron, right? Well, get this. What does 
she mean?” 

“The MiU . ” 

“Of course, the Mill. It’s always 
the Mill. She is also a word referring 
to the procreative aspect of something 
living, or semi-living, as you. You 
refer to another Iron as he, indicat- 
ing the provider aspect. I’ve oversim- 
plified it, but do you know where 
those words came from? They weren’t 
invented by the Mill.” 

“No.” 

“Well. Does the Mill ever tell you 
where she comes from?” Marigold 
signalled negatively. “Okay. I’ll tell 
you: 

C4^|^housands of suncycles ago, 
A this whole world was covered 
with a beautiful culture of wise and 
erudite people, all Flesh. There were 
great cities which extended miles into 
the air and miles underground, and 
you may have seen some of their 
mins. It’s from those that you get so 
much msty metal. These Flesh orgi- 
inally came from some star high in 
the sky, and they communicated 
with the Flesh living on that star. 



just as I talk with you. Men had 
houses that could fly, provided with ^ 
all possible comforts, and you Iron ^ 
were the servants of men “in those 
days. 

“But something happened. I don’t . 
know what and none of the books 
explain what. Anyway, the great set- 
tlements toppled to the ground and 
millions of men were killed.” 

Marigold stopped him with a blue- 
green flash and a honk of derision. 
“Millions?” he asked. “Why there are 
hardly a million of you Flesh in the 
whole world.” 

“A million and a half within a 
thousand miles of here. But don’t 
intermpt.” Bannock resumed his ex- 
planation. “The remaining Flesh had 
to learn to live off the land, while 
all that you Iron had to do was 
throw assorted old junk into your 
Mills. And I guess the Mills forgot 
all about the Flesh having built them 
in the beginning. Anyway, when we 
started to need metal, we used you 
Iron, and then you began to fight 
back. So, here we are. Probably 
matched in strength, though I doubt - 
there are as many of you as there 
are of us. 

“Anyway, to get back to the sub- 
ject — he and she. Any idea where 
the words came from?” 

“From Fleshr 

“Yes indeed. From male and fe- 
male Flesh.” Bannock began to ex- 
plain the facts of life. 

Surprisingly, in the end. Marigold 
understood and believed most of it. 
The idea upset him no small amount, 
and he wandered off to think. He 
was too abstracted to bother watch- 
ing the man, even. 



62 



IF 




Finally, Bannock called him to 
suggest they get going. 

The robot jerked to his feet and 
flashed assent. He buckled bis quiver 
back on, took his bow, and followed 
Bannock off toward the ridge. They 
hiked through a wide expanse of 
toss-furz, and Bannock swatted at 
the clouds of little spider-gnats that 
rose to sting him. Marigold did not 
pay any attention to the vehement 
cursing and slapping; and when they 
had passed the insects. Bannock no- 
ticed that the robot was wandering 
in a rather contemplative state, prob- 
ably only following him and jpot 
watching him at all. He could easi- 
ly be brained, then, and marked for 
future recovery, but Bannock de- 
cided to wait, since it seemed rather 
impolite to cut into someone’s 
thoughts so suddenly and literally. 

As the day began to get late. 
Marigold started to quiver with his 
late-aftemoon apprehension. 

Bannock stopped him and said, 
“Look, you’re starting to get all 
nervous again. Cut it out. When you 
get nervous, you get careless, and that 
happened once too often already, 
from what you’ve told me. I caught 
you. So for fistsake, calm down. No- 
body is going to brain you while 
you’re able to kill me. Look — 
wouldn’t you keep another Iron away 
from me, because I could kill you 
before he could do an)rthing?” 

Marigold flashed agreement, and 
his spirits began to improve. He had 
not noticed the fallacy of Bannock’s 
reasoning that two Irons could not 
easily deal with one Flesh, but nei- 
ther had Bannock. 

The ridge was quite close now, and 



they could see a gash through it, 
where Bannock said a river flowed. 

“The plain is just on the other 
side of the ridge. If we follow this 
ledge that leads along the side of 
that cliff, we can cut two days off 
our time. 

“A ledge,” Marigold mused doubt- 
fully, but when Bannock threw him a 
questioning glance, he flashed ac- 
cord and set out toward it. His ability 
to home in on ledges and cliffs had 
struck again. 

V 

A s they walked along the edge of 
the river. Bannock began to 
realize what a position he was in. As 
leader, he was vulnerable to any- 
thing the Iron decided to do, such as 
putting an arrow through his back. 
But occasional backward glances 
showed him that the Iron held a 
clear conscience and was planning 
no such action. 

The ground was rough with gran- 
ite boulders scattered through the 
sere brown grass and rustling scratch- 
bushes, and the ridge was quite near, 
its base hidden by a huddle of dark 
crawberry trees. They reached it as 
the sun was nearing the horizon. 
Marigold felt the loose gravel fodang 
of the path and raised a doubt 
“Hadn’t we better leave the cross- 
ing till tomorrow? We might not be 
so sure of our footing in the dark. 
Even with all my machinery, I dcnH 
like trying it now.” 

Bannock shook his head. “Why 
bother? The crossing is less than a 
mile; it shouldn’t take us loore 
than twenty minutes. If it gets to© 

«3 



FLESH AND THE IRON 




dark for your tastes, just turn on 
that headlight of yours. We might as 
well get it over with.” 

Marigold hesitated to agree, but 
finally followed Bannock. 

As they strode out onto the ledge, 
the last rays of daylight stained the 
cliff a flaming orange, bright enough 
to see clearly, and Marigold felt 
temporarily secure. But he kept go- 
ing faster and tagging at the heels of 
Bannock. The man warned him sever- 
al times against going so fast. But 
he did not really slow down until a 
rattling shower of dislodged pebbles 
nearly sent him flying into the 
rapids a hundred feet below. He so- 
bered up fast and proceeded at a more 
leisurely pace. 

Bannock turned a corner, then 
stuck his head back around. 

“Slow down. Marigold. We’ve 
come to a bit of shaky footing.” There 
was a dull stony crealdng as Bannock 
moved. When Marigold rounded the 
corner, he saw the ledge here con- 
sisted of narrow slabs of horizontal 
rock, thrust out from the cliffside. 
They were unsupported beneath, and 
not very wide. The Iron eyed the 
tossing current below, which now 
made a tight curve around the base 
of the ridge, and the boulders upon 
which he would fall if he were in- 
cautious. He slowed as he crossed 
the indicated shelves of rock, but not 
enough. There was a sinister creak- 
ing, and the rock upon which Mari- 
gold stood shuddered. He stopped 
stm. 

“What’s the trouble?” Bannock 
called. Then he turned back. 

Marigold did not move other than 
to carefully, slowly, extend his bow 



to Bannock, who took it and put it 
aside. ' “The arrows,” he whispered, 
as though the very wei^t ©f his 
breath would cause the rocks to lal. 

The rock did not creak. Bannock 
looked uncomfortably at the Iron, 
thinking fast. Then he said, “Take 
your rope out of your belly and toss 
it to me, and for fistsake don’t be 
careless as you usually are. Don’t get 
panicky.” 

Ti yi"arigold tightened all his motors 
■iVx and slowly reached for the rope. 
He buckled one end to a clip in his 
front, then flipped the other end to 
Bannock. The human caught it and 
quickly tied it to a projecting r^ 
which looked capable of supporting 
the robot’s weight, then turned back. 

“All right, now. Be as careful as 
hell. Take one step. If you feel the 
rock twitch, stop still.” 

Marigold’s motors whined, and bH 
cables tensed as he lifted his foot and 
moved it gently forward. The reek 
creaked, and suddenly he panidied. 
His foot slapped heavily against the 
rock, which shuddered and fell away. 
Marigold spun free on the ro]^ and 
slammed loudly against the side of 
the cliff, suspended above a two- 
hundred-foot fall by a thin nylon 
thread. 

Bannock looked uneasily ever tbe 
ledge. 

“How the hell am I going t© get 
you up here, anyway? You weigh a 
good ton, and I sure as hell can’t ift 
that.” 

Marigold stopped the frightened 
turgid flow of colors on his sema- 
phore and blazed forth a red s^ bot 
and angry that it seemed to bypass 

65 



FLESH AND THE IRON 




Bannock’s eyes and bum directly in- 
to bis brain. 

“Why should you care. Flesh? You 
might as well cut the rope and let 
me fall, so 1 won’t take your skull!” 

Bannock looked at the lron for a 
moment, then turned away, saying 
something foul and commonplace, 
and could be heard fidgetting with 
the rope. Marigold winced and ex- 
pected a sudden fall, but the Flesh 
peered over the edge. 

“The rope’ll take you. Now what 
you must do is try and pull yourself 
up the wall. Prop your legs against 
it and try to walk up.” 

T he Three Hunters had been out 
of Werser for five days and had 
not had noticeable success. They had 
seen four fanny-looking Iron on a 
distant hillside, but when they got 
there, armor-piercing rockets re^y in 
their wooden launchers, the Iron had 
gone. There was no spoor. 

Tom Bigboy decided that they must 
have been the new Sky Iron that 
could fly, which some Mill away east 
had been experimenting with, if one 
could believe what the New Romans 
said. Red Williams agreed. Dali 
Fingal, disappointed at not having 
been able to show how good a marks- 
man he was, made no comment 
They were coming to the Werser 
River for a drink, before they camp- 
ed for the night, when there came a 
loud and sudden clang, a burst of 
surprised static, and the rumble of 
falling rocks. 

“Clumsy Iron gone hung himself 
up,” lauded Red Williams grimly, 
and the three headed for the sound. 
High on a cliff, lit by the last 



rays of the sun, w^ a small hunaan 
figure struggling with a rope, and on 
the other end was an Iron, struggling 
to climb onto the ledge. 

“Goddamnit! It’s Bannock! He was 
out looking for parts, and I guess 
they found him?” 

Dali Fingal dourly stuffed a small 
rocket into the launcher, one lit the 
fuse with his electric lighter. The 
breech slammed shut, he aimed care- 
fully, and the little projectile arced 
its fiery trail across the river and ex- 
ploded against the rock holding the 
rope. The nylon cable parted, and the 
Iron scratched static through the 
silent dusk and fell bouncing and 
chunking from rock to rock. 

To get where the Iron lay was a 
somewhat more difficult matter than 
the three had thought, for they had to 
go downstream a bit to ford the river. 
When they approached the Iron’s 
corpse, they saw Bannock huddled 
over it. 

“Uh-oh,” mumbled Fingal. “He’ll 
probably try to claim it.” 

‘^Look, man, you shot the damn 
thing, and he’d be dead if you hadn’t 
done it You. tell him thatr 

Thus resolved, the three hunters 
went up to the corpse and faced Ban- 
nock. But Bannock was not trying 
to wrest the tenna from the machine, 
as they had expected. His face was 
white and streaked with wetness, and 
his eyes were red and angry. 

“Well, Bannock ...” 

The semaphore flickered a few 
last times, then died out The Iron 
shuddered and settled to stillness. 

“You bastards ...” Locker Ban- 
nock said thickly. He glared at them 
with futile raging hatred. END

IF ... and WHEN 

by LESTER DEL REY 
The New River of Life 



first intelligent creature to 
^ walk the surface of Mars stag- 
gers from his wrecked ship to survey 
the damage. He looks pale and 
bloodless — and he is; not a drop 
of blood circulates through his veins. 
His helmet is cracked, and there 
can be no air inside it; but he 
doesn’t worry about that What he 
is breathing is a liquid that gurgles 
slightly through a valve in his 
throat 

He isn’t a strange alien, how- 
ever, nor a robot He’s a normal, 
healthy man from Earth — or he 
will be a healthy one as soon as 
medical supplies can be sent down 
from the main ship. And his life 
expectancy is at least a decade long- 
er than that of the first astronauts. 

All this is the logical result of a 
literally bloodless revolution that 
came about in early spring of 1968. 
Like most really important discov- 



eries, the announcement of it was 
quiet, with most of the possflbilities 
inherent in it not even hinted at. 

The report stated simply that Dr. 
Robert P. Geyer, a Harvard bio- 
chemist, had discovered a chemical 
substitute for blood. Unlike plasma 
or saline solutions that are Injected 
to fill depleted blood vessels, this 
substance actively takes over the 
main duty of true blood. It carries 
oxygen to the cells and removes the 
waste carbon dioxide about as well 
as the hemoglobin in our red cells. 

The substance is a solution — or 
emulsion — of fluorocarbons, a 
chemical family that includes Tef- 
lon. Such chemicals are not easily 
broken down by other chemical ac- 
tion, and they have the advantage 
of being inert and non-toxic within 
the body. 

Animal experiments confirm that 
it can support life. It can be mixed 



67 





some normal blood without ap- 
parent damage to the blood ceUs. 
Or it can be used alone in place of 
the entire blood supply. Ctuiously, 
it seems safa: to use it alone than 
in a mixture with real blood. When 
all the blood was drained from the 
bodies of rats and replaced with 
fluorocarbons, the animals survived 
for eight hours, carrying on all the 
usual rat activities. There was no 
evidence of brain damage, as would 
have been the case if a full normal 
oxygen supply had not been main- 
tained for the body. 

Obviously, the substitute cannot 
do all the work of real blood; it 
has no white cells to protect the 
body, nor many of the substances in 
plasma which are needed. But it is 
already perfected enough to serve 
as an excellent carrier for oxygen 
and carbon dioxide. 

B y itself, such a development 
would have been revolutionary 
only in the ages when blood was 
called the sacred river of life, before 
we learned to pump stored blood 
and plasma into our veins. This is 
a great step beyond such procedures, 
but hardly one to cause any great 
excitement at first glance. On fur- 
ther study of the discovery, how- 
ever, the possibilities seem endless. 

Obviously, this offers new hope 
to those who are striving to drain 
the blood and replace it with a sub- 
stance that can be chilled before 
injection and which will prevent 



brain damage until the tissues can 
be frozen. Organs and tissues for 
later transplants can be more 
readily preserved. Diseases such as 
leukemia have already been sug- 
gested for treatment by flushing 
out all the blood and replacing it 
until the cause of the disease can 
be treated. 

The substitute offers two great 
advantages over real blood. First, 
it can be completely sterilized by 
heating in a loop outside the body 
and then cooling back to body tem- 
perature. One of the chief dangers 
of any cancer operation is metas- 
tasis, caused by cancer cells that 
break free and are carried through 
the blood. Most past methods of 
prophylaxis have been too danger- 
ous for use. But with the fluoro- 
carbons instead of blood during the 
operation, all such malignant cells 
can be eliminated. This promises a 
tremendous reduction of agony and 
saving of lives. 

Secondly, the fluorocarbons will 
not clot. This makes them inevi- 
table for operations where the risk 
of clotting now almost forbids the 
needed treatment. One of the lead- 
ing causes of heart failure is athe- 
roscleroisis — the forming of fatty 
deposits in the blood vessels; clots 
form around such obstructions, cut- 
ting off the flow of blood to the 
heart itself. Clot solvents of ex- 
ceptional strength can be used with 
the fluorocarbons to remove these. 
And even the dissolving of the 



68 



IF 




fatty deposits themselves becomes 
feasible. There need no longer be a 
risk of the blood clotting around 
the fatty d^osits as they are dis- 
solved and freed. This same virtue 
suggests the use of fluorocarbons 
in the case of ‘^stroke” — or the 
rupturing of a blood vessel in the 
brain — to enable the removal of 
the clots and pressure before too 
much damage can be done. 

A lesser advantage is the ease of 
storage and the eventual easy 
availability of the substitute. There 
is no longer any reason for death 
by severe bleeding in accidents, 
generally; a handy supply of 
fluorocarbons should be part of 
every medicine chest in the future. 

Thus the new discovery offers a 
potential increase in the average 
life expectancy of as much as ten 
years. Unlike other such advances, 
this one does not operate by saving 
us from infant mortality alone, but 
gives the greatest benefit to those 
who are already well along in years. 

'^here is no reason that the fluor- 
ocarbons have to be consid- 
ered only within the blood vessels, 
despite the fact that they were de- 
veloped for such use. The essen- 
tial fact is that we now have a 
liquid which acts as an excellent 
carrier for the exchange of oxy- 
gen and carbon dioxide and which 
has no damaging effect on the tis- 
sues of the human body. 

It is here outside the circula- 



tory system that we can look for 
a real revolution in some of the 
worlds of science fiction. 

Man has been an air-breathing 
creature since his remote ancestors 
left the sea. So far, no animal that 
has made the transition from 
breathing air has ever gone back; 
whales may stay under water for 
half an hour, but they have to come 
up to breathe eventually. The re- 
growth of gills just doesn’t hap- 
happen. Even Norman L. Knight’s 
delightful gill-bearing sea people 
were supposed to be the result of 
tremendous advances in genetic en- 
gineering. 

Now we have a means of giv- 
ing men the power to breathe a 
liquid without any great tinkering 
with the body and with no danger 
of genetic damage. Since the fluor- 
ocarbons are safe and effective, we 
have a means to supply oxygen to 
our lungs by regulating the amount 
dissolved into the liquid. 

We’ve discovered the hard wav 
that carrying air down to a dept:i 
of 600 feet or more is not a good 
answer. Gas compresses under pres- 
sure, while liquid does not, to any 
practical degree. Despite the use 
of all kinds of gas mixtures, either 
the oxygen pressure becomes too 
great or the other gases begin to 
dissolve in the blood, often acting 
like hallucinogens. 

The use of water itself has been 
suggested largdy because air- 
breathing at the depths is so hope- 



IF . AND WHEN 



69 




less. For small animals, the use of 
highly-pressured oxygenated water 
makes total submersion possible; 
mice have lived in such tanks. But 
so far, the use for human underwa- 
ter existence has not been promis- 
ing. Water really isn’t a good en- 
vironment for the lungs of men who 
must go back and forth between 
media. 

So our future merman breathes 
air on land and fluorocarbons un- 
der water. He carries a recirculating 
system in a tank, and this is con- 
nected to him by a small valve in- 
serted into his windpipe, and per- 
haps similar valves into other body 
cavities. Such valves are no more 
painful or irritating than those now 
used in cases of people with kid- 
ney disfunctions, where they per- 
mit abdominal flushing of wastes 
from the blood. The insertion of 
the fluorocarbon tube into the 
valve automatically switches it to 
liquid-breathing. 

He’s almost impervious to pres- 
sure changes, being filled with li- 
quid. Once he flushes out the ni- 
trogen dissolved in his blood, he is 
safe from either bends or nitrogen 
narcosis. Instead of spending most 
of his time in slow descent and as- 
cent, he can actually live and work 
for days or weeks at the bottom of 
the continental shelf. When he re- 
turns to land, bis lungs are drained 
and air-breathing is restored. 

He’s a true amphibian mammal, 
something nature never developed. 



'^he use of such a medium for 
breathing is not limited to the 
world of water, either, handy as 
that must be in our overpopulated 
future of dwindling land resources. 
In space, air in the lungs is ^ arti- 
ficial as any other medium, with 
dangerous disadvantages. 

On the surface of the moon or 
outside his spaceship, any minor 
suit puncture threatens the astro- 
naut’s life as the air rushes nut in- 
to the vacuum. This isn’t instantly 
fatal; the human skin is strong 
enough to prevent the direct ex- 
plosion of liquids inside it, even 
though they boil at zero pressure 
when directly exposed to space. But 
the margin of time is limited to 
somewhat less than a minute. After 
that, the tissues of the lungs are 
exposed to emptiness and begin to 
release their liquids through sur- 
face boiling, with fatal and agon- 
izing results. 

In contrast, our hero landing 
with a crash on Mars is breathing 
a liquid, because he knows the risks 
demand it. (The extra weight is 
only a tiny fraction of his total life- 
support system, so it’s standard 
equipment for all space flight.) 

The ship cabin and his helmet 
both crack open, and the air rushes 
out into the near-vacuum of Mars. 
But our hero’s lungs are filled 
with liquid, chosen for its high 
zero-pressure boiling point. It 
can’t rush out instantly. In fact, 
its pressure is low enough to be 



70 



IF 




retained easily by the valve in his 
throat It goes on supplying him 
oxygen. 

Then pain lashes at him, and he 
sees that a splinter of the cabin 
has cut a main artery in his leg and 
he’s bleeding to death. Now he 
tears off a container of fluorocar- 
bon from the wall and begins giv- 
ing himself a massive transfusion. 
By the time he can clamp and seal 
the wound with “instant skin” from 
a spray can, he has lost almost all 
his blood, which can’t be replaced 
until the big ship lands. But he 
hardly notices any difficulty, ex- 
cept for some stinging of his skin 
where the elastic undersuit doesn’t 
protect it. He heads out for Mars to 
survey the damage. He’ll repair the 



crack in his helmet with a can of 
glue while he is outside. A quarter 
of an hour has gone by, and he 
isn’t dead, as he’d long since have 
been if he’d been breathing air. 

These are only a few of the pos- 
sibilities. At the very least, we’ve 
doubled the number of ways we 
can breathe and handle our inter- 
nal exchange of oxygen and carbon 
dioxide. To me, that’s a major rev- 
olution. 

Nobody can yet tell where it 
will all lead, any more than they 
could guess the future of electronic 
amplification sixty years ago. But 
it will be fun to watch our writers 
and scientists grapple with the sud- 
den end of one of our limitations.

tender and loving toward her crew!

/^Iga flexed her landing ports ex- 
pectantly and activated their 
dj^tic pickups; all she could see was 
a ringed planet against a back- 
ground of stars. In her eagerness to 
receive her new human charges she 
regretted the delay between the 



sending of the call-grams and the 
eventual arrival of the colonists. 

Olga had decided to send a second 
starship to the Procyon system. It 
would be one of the Implant class, 
designed to set up an earth-t}^e bio- 
sphere on the target planet. About 
toee generations ago she had sent 
Procyon Implant One, but now — 



72 



in the light of new survival theory 
— she realized that the probabilities 
of a successful “take” from it were 
small. She felt (cybemetically) that 
it was time for Procyon Implant 
Two. It would be her first follow-up 
to any system. 

Up to now her only contact with 
her interstellar colonists had been 
via the single faster-than-light tor- 
pedoes which were sent back auto- 
matically by the starship’s comput- 
er upon their arrival at the target 
planet. The information they car- 
ried was primarily astrogational, 
with a little survey of the local 
ecology. Extrapolations on Implant 
survival were possible, of course; 
but an actual on-the-spot inspection 
several generations later would be 
far more useful in determining the 
makeup of future Implants. In addi- 
tion, Procyon Implant Two would 
be larger and better equipped for 
siuwival. The skill/genetic parame- 
ters of the human component check- 
ed out very favorably in simulated 
runs against a variety of possible 
alien threats. 

Olga hummed and clicked. She 
loved humans, and her companion- 
ship circuits nagged at her when 
they were empty. Saturation is what 
she craved — saturation of all her 
receptors. At this moment the huge 
parabolic electromagnetic receptor 
that had been focused on the laser 
tail of Grus Implant One stood 
idle. That tail had signed off some 
eight years after the return of the

torpedo, confirming the safe Im- 
plant Down. But while that recep- 
tor stood idle it irritated her. It 
hungered for contact with a new 
laser tail and its modulated human 
messages. Soon it would be satisfied 
by Procyon Two. 

After running a quick check on 
her sensors in the new starship she 
confirmed that the suspended sam- 
ples of earth phyla were ready for 
man. The sleeping spores, seeds an .1 
embryos were ready to surround the 
new colonist with a protective bio- 
sphere of friendly life forms on that 
alien planet. Yes, she calculated, 
a successful “take” was highly prob- 
able — this time. 

II 

/^ne of Olga’s first call-grams 
came to the dormitory phone of 
Ralph Eggers, engineering student 



STAR ITCH 



73 





at Ames, Iowa. It was Saturday 
mommg, and ke was dressed for his 
road work — sneakers, sweat shirt 
and denims. He carefully wrote out 
the message. Then, studying it, he 
walked down the road to the rail- 
road tracks to start his jog. As a 
student he led sort of a sedentary 
existence. If be was to satisfy the 
physical qualifications for an Im- 
plant he felt he had to follow a dedi- 
cated routine of diet and exercise. 

He was elated. He had first vol- 
unteered his name at the earliest 
age — sixteen — in the hopes of a 
straight genetic draft. He had been 
optimistic because of his hybrid mix- 
ture. But to make sure, when he 
wasn^t sdected immediately he start- 
ed embdlishing his application with 
high-priority skills like soil chem- 
istry and a broad based engineering 
course. Now, three years later, Olga 
had finally drafted him. 

An hour later and two pounds 
lighter he came to the seven-mile 
marker. He was caked with dried 
salt front his sweat. He took out his 
lemon and bit into it, chewing up 
about a third of it and then spitting 
out the pulp and seeds. The acid 
juice burned an open blister on his 
palm. 

As he started back to town at the 
same pace he mentally scheduled 
the next two days. Shower and drink 
milk with gelatin now, take a nap, 
caU Professor Jmnes and Betty. He 
would have to drop by the profes- 
sor^s house to say good-by. He didn’t 



know any of the other professors 
well enough to bother them over the 
weekend with his departure. Profes- 
sor James was his advisor and could 
take care of the official school pa- 
perwork on Monday. 

He would plan a late supper with 
Betty — meat and a salad. Saying 
good-by to her would be hard, but 
he had been more or less expecting 
it. He hoped that she wouldn’t take 
it too hard. 

A phone call to his big brother — 
married and raising feed cattle in 
Oelwein — would take care of his 
few personal belongings; and then, 
after a brief day of Earthside rem- 
iniscence, he would fly to Computer 
Central. In less than forty-eight 
hours he would be facing Olga and 
passing the final tests. 

He slowed to a walk about a 
'"quarter of a mile from the fraternity 
bouse. He usually managed to sweat 
off about three and a half pints of 
water, and he was very thirsty. He 
pulled off his heavy, wet sweatshirt 
and slung it over his right shoulder 
as he walked. It was autumn. The 
dry leaves he crunched through 
showed all the artist’s shades of yel- 
low, red and brown. Yes, if he stop- 
ped to think about it he could be- 
come very melancholy about leaving 
Earth permanently. He was happy 
for the two-day deadline. It gave 
him very little time to think. 

He expected that there would be 
times when he would miss his home, 
his family, his classmates . and 



74 



IF 




of course he would miss Betty. But 
there was never any question of 
withdrawing his application to Im- 
plant Out. He had always wanted 
to go to the stars. The alternative 
— to remain on earth his whole life 
span — never even occurred to him. 

Another future colonist lay ob- 
tunded in a strange bed. He 
wasn^t sure of where he was ... or, 
for that matter, what day it was. 

He opened his eyes and focused 
carefully on the imfamiliar, gray- 
white, o-acked adobe walls. His oc- 
ciput throbbed, and his tongue felt 
large and sticky. A granular coating 
lined his teeth. 

Robert J. Zuliani, L.S.H. (Licens- 
ed State Healer) was recovering 
from what had become an all too 
frequent occurrence of late — an 
extended weekend of drinking, fight- 
ing and making love . but mostly 
drinking. 

As his sensory modalities returned 
he learned that he was lying in a 
lumpy bed that consisted of a couple 
of sMped, musty pillows^ a thin 
mattress and a stiff, brown army 
blanket There were no linens. On 
closer eKamination he couldn^t even 
be sure that it was an army blanket. 
It was too soiled to tell. 

He sat up slowly and steadied 
himself until his vestibular appara- 
tus caught up with him. When he 
swung his feet over the side of the 
bed he found on the floor a neat pile 
of his dothes, all folded, with his 



wallet, watch and pistol on top. 

The pistol was a small .25 caliber 
model, and the clip was still full. 
There had not been much exdte- 
ment on this trip — he guessed. The 
billfold still contained three of the 
crisp, new hundred dollar bills, and 
there was some paper change in one 
pocket. Hardly enough was missing 
for more than a couple days of 
drinking, he estimated. As he sat 
there his head cleared perceptibly 
— confirming the shorter than av- 
erage ‘‘weekend.” 

He stood up gingerly and slipped 
on his pants. A basin of cloudy wa- 
ter stood on a crate in the corner. 
He splashed his hands and face. 
Then — drying with his handker- 
chief — he walked out on a screened- 
in porch which was furnished a little 
like a kitchen. Judging from the 
shadows it was about noon. He saw 
his air-cushion car parked by the 
front door. It was well off the road 
and didn’t seem to be sitting square- 
ly on the ground. That bothered 
him. 

A nude teen-age girl was sunning 
herself in the patio. Her slim figure 
and large eyes might have looked al- 
most attractive in a dimly lit bar, 
but out there in the full glare of the 
sunlight she looked pale and ca- 
chectic. There were disquieting lines 
under her eyes and a very worri- 
some bandage on the left side of 
her neck. The bandage looked fresh, 
but there was already a yellow stain 
in its cdDter. He didn’t notice any 



STAR ITCH 



75 




lamps on the other side of her neck 
— or dsewhere on her body — but 
he winced as the list of differential 
diagnoses flashed reflexively through 
his mind. 

Quickly he glanced back into the 
bedroom, and relaxed a little when 
he saw a tousled head on the other 
striped pillow. He made a mental 
note to have his skin test rechecked 
in about three months — just to be 
on the safe side, 

T) rushing a few lazy flies away he 
^ sorted through a clutter of 
bowls and utensils to find some cold 
refried beans. He wrapped them in 
a flour tortilla and ate between sips 
of Scotch from an almost dry pinch 
bottle. Then, as he dressed, he tried 
to sort things out in his mind. 

He knew that he was somewhere 
in the Reservation. Hopefully" he 
was not too far from one of the bor- 
der posts, in view of the possible 
damage to his car. He still had over 
half of the money he started out 
with, so he might not be overdue at 
the State Clinic. 

As he had expected, his suit coat 
was pretty badly soiled — stains 
from food, mud and other nonde- 
script sources. He scrubbed it brief- 
ly in the basin and was hanging it 
on a nail by the door when the sun- 
bather came in. She was tieing the 
belt of her flimsy knee-length wrap- 
around when she saw him. She look- 
ed about fourteen years old. 

He grinned and raised his now 



empty bottle in a salute. She chirp- 
ed something friendly in the native 
dialect which he interpreted loosely 
as: ^‘Good afternoon. Are you up 
already?” Evidently she misunder- 
stood his gesture with the bottle; 
she rummaged through an ice chest 
in the corner and came up with a 
fairly cold can of beer. She sat and 
smiled while he opened it and drain- 
ed half the contents. 

*^1 guess you don^ speak Eng- 
lish,” he ventured. 

Her smile broadened, but she 
didn^t say a word. 

''Well, I don’t speak Native; and 
IVe got to be getting back.” He 
walked into the bedroom, using the 
excuse of putting money under the 
pillow in order to get a good look 
at his bed partner — making cer- 
tain that she was a meatier, and 
heailthier, specimen. 

He gave the simbather a small bill 
and picked up two more cans of 
beer and the opener. In the yard he 
confirmed his suspicion that he had 
^'parked” on a sharp rock again. The 
blades were badly tom up, but the 
motor turned over smoothly. None 
of the "idiot lights” were on, so he 
hoped that all that would be needed 
was a new set of blades. Well, the 
men at the garage ought to be used 
to replacing them by now. Unfor- 
tunately, he would have to walk all 
the way to the border to find a com- 
municator booth. 

He started north on the little vil- 
lage’s only road, hardly more than 



76 



IF 




a dusty trail. An occasional sullen 
native watched from a doorway. 
Bob’s clothing marked him as an 
outsider, but he had little to fear 
during the daylight. 

It was a small austere village. The 
few houses were adobe like the one 
he woke up in. Utilities were com- 
pletely absent. Aj^arently the girls 
were the only '^industry.” 

When he glanced back he saw 
that his bed partner was up and 
around. She was picking up a high 
heeled shoe she had left in his car. 
She waved. The car looked like it 
was well within the girl’s property 
line; it should be safe enough there 
until tomorrow. 

As he followed the road it wound 
between low hills which were cov- 
ered with shoulder-high chips of 
white and variegated stone. The 
landscape was barren except for an 
occasional small stubborn clump of 
desert type vegetation — dry and 
spiny. Small clouds of powdery 
white dust followed his feet, and the 
afternoon sun stubbornly maintain- 
ed its heat and glare until it touched 
the broken peaks to the west. 

He took off his shoes and stock- 
ings, drank another can of beer and 
continued on. Several hours later his 
left knee began to develop a gritty 
ache at the site of an old judo in- 
jury. Fatigue and thirst slowed him 
down. The darkness of the Reserva- 
tion was absolute. There was not an 
artificial light within miles. The 
stars were bright, and he was guided 



by a faint glow to the north. Later 
the glow marked most of the horizon 
ahead of him. It was the coastal 
town of Greater Laguna. Closer — 
ahead — he saw an occasional fleet- 
ing headlight that marked the cross- 
roads at the border check station. 
About four in the morning he was 
showing his I.D. to a sleepy guard. 

A fter freshening up and drinking 
a pint of water he checked in 
with his answering service. There 
were the usual routine messages . 
and the call-gram. 

There was a pause before she 
read it: “It’s for starship Procyon 
Two. You are to report at Computer 
Central by the ninth. Why, that is 
tomorrow I” 

He had been expecting — or rath- 
er hoping — for this for some time 
now. 

“Does that mean you’ll be leaving 
us?” she asked. 

“Yes, Miss Collingsworth, I’ll be 
leaving. Would you arrange to have 
the old man notified? There is no 
rush. Tomorrow morning around 
coffee-break time is fine. I’ll be go- 
ing to Com Cen from here. And, oh 
yes, tell him that the car is about 
forty miles south of the border on 
Route Two. It needs a new set of 
blades.” Then he signed off and 
went back to the drinking fountain. 

The old man, Roger Derrick, 
SX.H., was his immediate superior 
at the Clinic. He knew about his 
plans for Implant Out, so most of 



STAR ITCH 



77 




the professional details had been al- 
ready taken care of. His patients 
would miss his no-nonsense attitude, 
but there were plenty of healers to 
take over now. The State had step- 
ped up its healer program some 
years back when many of the older 
practitioners began to Implant Out. 
But that seemed to no longer be a 
problem; through psychological 
screening the potential colonists 
were barred from healer training. 
Bob had little respect for the new 
breed of young healer — a soft- 
handed paper-pusher who kept his 
parameds between himself and the 
patients. 

Without another word to anyone 
he took a shuttle to the airport. Ig- 
noring the curious glances his di- 
sheveled appearance drew from the 
hostess he bought a ticket and con- 
sumed one of their quaint little 
meals with two cocktails on the way 
to Com Cen. 

His call-gram had come rather 
quickly. Healer skill units were in 
short supply for Implants. Olga tried 
to have about ten per cent in that 
category, but most of the volunteers 
were the adventuresome young who 
were too impatient to spend the six 
or eight years in L.S.H. preparation. 
So Olga relied heavily on the para- 
meds to fill her quota. 

HI 

A t Computer Central Zuliani was 
introduced aroimd the Life Sys-- 



terns section and immediately put to 
work in Suspension. Olga (a mne- 
monic for the Optic and Auditory 
pickups and the Graphic and Lin- 
gual readouts of the cybernetic sat- 
ellite) handled most of the process- 
ing with her surface-based com- 
ponents. She handled all the inter- 
views and records while he was left 
with the type of work he enjoyed — 
the knife and needle holder. 

Each human had synthetic cath- 
eters placed in the brachial artery 
and vein on the side of the dominant 
cerebral hemisphere — usually the 
left arm, since most people are right- 
handed. This assured optimal perfu- 
sion of the dominant carotid artery 
and its supply area in the eerebrd 
cortex. 

Starship su^nsion involved tem- 
peratures in the range of one to 
three degrees above freezing. This 
avoided the problems of ice crystal- 
lization in the cells, but it also re- 
quired perfusion of the capillary 
beds to supply oxygen at about 
1/1,000 of the normal metabolic 
rate. Each human had an individual 
Life System Servo that pumped the 
oxygen-rich, hypertonic solution 
through the vessels and in addition 
controlled electrolytes with semiper- 
meable membranes, and titrated a 
variety of hormones and drugs to 
handle the jolted physiology of go- 
ing in and out of suspension. 

Bob Zuliani met Rdph during his 
arteriovenous cutdown. When a lit- 
tle doe-eyed female walked by.

IP 




Ralph falbwed her with his eyes 
and said: ^‘I’d like about a pound 

of that'' 

Bob added: “Wrapped in cello- 
phane." 

Like the password of some secret 
brotherhood those comments opened 
up their conversation. 

“That is an interesting pattern of 
blisters you’ve got there — sym- 
metrical, both palms. Did you get 
them in the gym?” asked Bob as he 
sponged the incision with a moist 
gauze. 

Ralph looked up over the white 
screen through wbch his arm was 
protruding and answered: “Yes. The 
highbar.” He lay back down and 
added: “But I’m not much good at 
it. I just do a few pulhips and kips 
to stay in shape.” 

“I’d guess as much,” said Bob as 
he absently grayed red antiseptic. 
“A real dedicated gymnast would 
have enough callous to keep from 
opening up blisters.” 

Later, standing in the lunch line, 
Ralph noticed that Bob’s slightly 
shorter stature was exaggerated by a 
reflex crouch he would unconscious- 
ly assume — sort of a modified 
shiko-daebi stance. He explained 
that he had acqmred this habit 
while in training for The Games. He 
had spent twelve summers compet- 
ing and managed to survive into the 
semifinals twice, where he lost to 
powerful International Champions. 

That helped explain his rugged 
appearance. Subcutaneous gristle (a 



fibrovascular scar tissue with focal 
areas of metaplastic cartilage for- 
mation) covered the “leading edges” 
of most of his bony prominences: 
bridge of nose, eye brows, hands, el- 
bows, pretibial areas and feet. 

He hadn’t competed for years, 
now. He had stopped when he found 
he was losing to kids half his age 
— kids who could just wear him 
down with the resiliency of youth. 
It was after he quit that he noticed 
his drinking increasing to fill the gap 
once held by competition. 

T heir conversations at meal time 
ran the gamut of liquor, sex 
and spaceflight. Bob knew many of 
the technical details on suspension, 
but they didn’t ease Ralph’s mind 
any. Being naked and frozen in a 
giant ice cube tray was not his idea 
of a good way to spend ten years. 
He would have preferred a “green- 
house” ship, in which the colonists 
cavorted about in a lush tropical 
hydroponics chamber — where th 
could live with a sort of Garden of 
Eden abandonment. 

Bob disagreed. “Ten years is a 
long time to be cramped inside a 
closed space with the same people. 
Psychologically it would be rough. 
And the biochemistry would be very 
critical. Any minor miscalculation in 
trace elements would be greatly ag- 
gravated by the time they arrived at 
the target planet. In addition you 
have an aging human breeding stock 
that must control their reproduction

take suspension any day. No 
psychiatric problems at all — • and 
very little biochemistry. Since well 
be perking along at about one thou- 
sandth of normal we’ll only age met- 
abolically a few days.” 

Ralph didn’t look convinced. 

Bob gazed into the bottom of his 
glass as he sloshed an ice cube 
around and said: ‘^Actually it will 
be just like falling asleep and wak- 
ing up — if everything goes smooth- 
ly.” 

^^If everything goes smoothly,” 
repeated Ralph. 

“Well, perhaps it isn’t quite that 
simple, but it has been shown by 
the torpedo records that suspension 
survival compares favorably with 
greenhouse survival. The same pro- 
portion of the colonists arrive at 
their destination,” said Bob with 
clinical detachment. 

Ralph didn’t ask what the pro- 
portion was, but he assumed that 
it was less than the survival of the 
same population if it stayed on 
earth for ten years and fought traf- 
fic on the flyway, smoked tobacco 
and ate too many calories. 

He would still have preferred to 
be awake and facing whatever dan- 
gers there were. 

IV 

1^ alph didn’t remember going to 
sleep, but gradually he realized 



that he could see the pearly white, 
inner walls of his suspension tank. 
His Kttle servo was pumping con- 
tentedly on his A.V. hookup, and 
the slightly opalescent liquid sur- 
rounding him was still. 

He did remember being trans- 
ported out to the starship with the 
rest of the humans. The trip was 
enjoyable, although a bit over- 
crowded in the tender. Nose cam- 
eras got a good view of Saturn’s 
rings and moons as they entered 
Olga’s approach path. Weightless- 
ness was new, of course, but the 
drinks which the parameds served 
them were very relaxing. He was 
actually a little euphoric when they 
placed him in his tank and hooked 
up the arteriovenous tubing. 

That was the last thing he re- 
membered — until now. 

He wondered why he was awake. 
Could this be the end of the trip, 
so soon? It was supposed to be just 
like going to sleep and waking up, 
but he hadn’t expected it to be this 
easy. He studied the readout panel 
of his beige servo. 

The temporal readout indicated 
that less than five years of ship’s 
time had passed. He was still en 
route. 

Why was he awake? 

He looked over the rest of the 
panel, trying to remember the dia- 
grams Bob had shown him. The 
readouts appeared to be increased 
in numbers and jumbled in their 
arrangement. But they were clear- 



80 



IF 




ly labeled. One of the new ones was 
Udi)eled metabolic time”; it indi- 
cated that he was still in his second 
subjective day. 

The encephalogram was a flat 
line on the right, but showed spik- 
ing cerebral activity on the left. 
For some reason the side of his 
brain closest to his A.V. tubing was 
warming up. This was confirmed 
by the thermal records. The supply 
area of the left carotid was growing 
warmer while the rest of the body 
was dropping below freezing tem- 
perature. 

Something was terribly wrong. He 
didn’t know what had happened, 
but they were near that point in 
the startrip when the ship was sche- 
duled to rotate. 180 degrees to begin 
deceleration. Perhaps a shock had 
moved the catheter up into the car- 
otid, or a large blood clot might be 
blocking the other vessels. He didn’t 
know. 

But all of these readings should 
be being relayed and monitored 
somewhere else on the ship. Some- 
one — or something — should come 
soon to make things right. 

He tried not to think. He feared 
that his brain would metabolize too 
fast for the servo and use up the 
available oxygen, burning out the 
neurones. 

But now he just couldn’t stop 
thinking — and worrying. The 
harder he tried to relax his brain 
the more active it became. He await- 
ed his rescuer. 



A surge of liquid carried Bttle 
specks past his face. He thou^ 
he recognized epithelial debris m- 
duding flaky white keratin, little 
black hairs and small gobs of yellow 
greasy sebaceous secretions. These 
were normal external dermal wastes. 
He knew that the inner cdls of his 
body were being cleaned too — by 
the perfusion solution — unless the 
temperature changes were causing 
ice crystals or clots in the small 
capillaries. He wondered how low 
his ” antifreeze” was set. The read- 
outs indicated minus 4 degrees for 
his body and plus 32 degrees for his 
left cerebrum. Perhaps all the extra 
alcohol that Bob was drinking had 
a purpose — additional antifreeze. 

At first he thought the new white 
speck that crossed his field of vi- 
sion was just another ball of keratin 
debris. Then he thought he saw it 
wiggle — move by itself I But that 
was impossible. Nothing wiggles at 
a minus 4 degrees centigrade. He 
tried to focus on it but it kept drift- 
ing just outside his visual field. 

He got a better look at the nexi: 
white speck. It did wiggle. It looked 
like a large grain of polished white 
rice. Then he noticed several more 
drifting up from the right side of 
his servo. He tried to look down. 
His left eye moved best, in its 
slightly warmer socket. When he re- 
focused he saw what looked like a 
handful of rice on the blistered area 
of his right palm. His hand rested, 
frozen in a relaxed position on his

right thi^ The white mass quiver- 
ed, and individual little specks 
crawled away in different directions 
on his leg ... • 

Maggots! 

He felt a strong impulse to jump 
up and brush them off. But he 
couldn’t even scream. 

They gradually increased in num- 
bers imtil the edges of both visual 
fields contained fleeting glimpses of 
the swimming, wiggling maggots 
about the size of small caterpillars. 
A violent itching began as they pen- 
etrated the blisters and began to 
crawl imder the skin of his hand and 
forearm. On the back of his hand 
they began to emerge, perforating 
the skin and exposing the under- 
lying tissues. He was being eaten 
alive! 

Years of ship time remained. He 
was afraid that he would lose too 
much tissue to survive unless some- 
one was brought out of suspension 
to rescue him. He watched in hor- 
ror as they stripped the skin from 
his hand. He could see bones, blood- 
less vessels and thin white struc- 
tures that were probably tendons 
and nerves — all stiff, gray-white 
and frozen. The ravenous larvae 
stayed away from his slightly warm- 
er head and left arm. Perhaps these 
''space maggots” were some new 
mutation that only fed on frozen 
space travelers. But how did they 
get into his tank? 

The hatch arid its viewport were 
a little out of focus. His cold ciliary 



muscles were a bit sluggish in 
changing the focal length of his 
lens, but several minutes (subjec- 
tive time) of effort brought the port 
into shaiper focus. Images flawed 
by outside, not stopping long 
enough for Idm to recognize. Some- 
one was out there. But they couldn’t 
enter the tank without cycling the 
room and rewarming him — and 
that obviously would result in his 
hemorrhaging to death. 

The bones of his right arm sud- 
denly disarticulated and began to 
drift away, leaving a waving mass 
of vessels and nerves which were 
covered by a thick, wriggly tangle 
of white larvae. A sensation of un- 
bearable pruritis reached his sen- 
sory cortex as the naked nerves 
were digested. 

A face remained in the viewport 
long enough for his cool rods to 
catch an image. It was Bob. He 
stuck a small sign against the plate 
which read: OLGA READING 
YOUR E. E. G. HELP ON WAY. 

Translating his brain waves 
would be simple for a computer 
like Olga, especially since she had 
several generations of experience 
with the life-system sensors. He re- 
laxed a bit. As he relaxed he realiz- 
ed that Olga would recognize the 
change in his encephalogram; she 
could tell Bob that his sign had 
been read. 

T he persistent larvae continued 
their attack on the frozen tis- 



82 



IF 




sues. The skin on his thighs was 
elevated and lumpy. 

The sign was (ianged for one 
which read: NEW LOCK BEING 
BUILT. HELP ON WAY. 

Judging by his servo’s temporal 
indicator he guessed that the signs 
were being left up about thirty min- 
utes — just long enough, at this 
sluggish metabolic rate, for him to 
read and interpret them. He had 
his eyes focused on the viewport 
when he thought he felt his abdo- 
men sag. Straining, he focused down 
to see the larvae stripping away the 
yellow belly fat and exposing the 
frozen, brown muscular wall. Then 
the wall split at the linea alba. Coils 
of pale anemic intestines protruded 
and the maggots invaded the peri- 
toneal cavity. 

Finally a circular defect began 
to appear in the tank wall next to 
the hatch. Then he realized why 
there had been the long delay. They 
must have constructed an emergen- 
cy lock system outside so that his 
tank could be entered without going 
through the rewarming cycle. If 
they could only hurry he’d survive. 
His injuries could be surgically cor- 
rected with only minor deformities 
— and with a couple of prostheses 
he could get along fairly well. 

The cutting of the new hatch 
seemed to irritate the maggots, and 
they became more active. Sudden- 
ly, granular, green-brown clouds of 
debris began to billow out of his 
abdomen. 



The longer it took to rescue him, 
the worse his subsequent deform- 
ities would be. But he tried to keep 
hope of eventual rescue — all the 
deformities in the world didn’t de- 
press him nearly as much as the 
possibility of death and oblivion. 

Some of the larger larvae were 
two inches long now, and their vig- 
orous strength could be seen as they 
burrowed under his larger internal 
organs and made them quiver. 

Then, finally, the newly installed 
hatch opened. 

There was a swirl of the cloudy, 
granular fluids as Bob swam in, 
wearing a bright orange spacesuit. 
He moved very quickly in Ralph’s 
physiologic time. The fluid resis- 
tance slowed him just enou^ to 
keep him a recognizable blur as he 
flashed about gathering the larvae 
into sealed bladi containers. 

The larvae were about six inches 
in length now, and they quickly be- 
gan to penetrate the container walls. 
They attached themselves to Bob’s 
helmet and began to etch his face- 
plate with their enzymes. Their 
barbed setae scratched at his seams. 
Bob retreated into the lock, but 
Ralph thought he saw a knot of 
maggots moving under the face- 
plate just as the hatch closed again. 

The fluids took on a greener color 
as the biliary system was opened. 
He saw his lobulated, brown Kver 
slide toward his lap, and then his 
pelvis and femurs disarticulated in 
a slow motion clutter. A few verte- 



STAR ITCH 



83 




brae tumbled out, and the branching 
spinal nerves waved slowly. 

Then he realized that he was 
tedmically dead, as he saw his pink, 
globular heart tumble out in a diow- 
er of ribs and bristled maggots. 

The pruritis fluctuated. Soon ev- 
en his eyeballs began to itch. 

'^he cornea continued to itch, and 
^ then his vision clouded up a 
little. Then he realized that the 
maggots had turned the tank’s fluids 
into an enzyme soup that threat- 
ened to digest everything. 

Double vision occurred as one of 
the eye muscles parted. Then one 
of the double images moved sud- 
denly upwards and went out of fo- 
cus as that eyeball was penetrated 
and the vitreous evacuated. Soon 
the other eye would probably go 
also, and he would be blind. He 
looked up at the port and the sign 
W35 still up: HELP ON WAY. 

Rescue at this late date would 
mean an existence in a perfusion 
tank with one good eye to view the 



world. The only way he could com- 
municate would be through his en- 
cephalographic readouts. It wouldn’t 
be much of an existence, he thought. 

Then darkness fell ss the other 
eyeball collapsed. 

Still his faithful servo pumped 
the life supporting fluids through 
the cerebral hemisphere, and still 
he lived. 

His consciousness remained sharp. 
If his brain alone were rescued he 
was sure that some sort of instru- 
mentation could be devised to com- 
municate with it. He began to de- 
spair. All his sense organs had been 
destroyed — sight, sound, taste and 
smell were gone. All he could do 
now was think and experience pain. 

The itching rose to a crescendo 
and ceased as the last of the peri- 
pheral nerves were digested. In the 
subsequent lull a new discomfort 
developed — a throbbing internal 
headache. The larvae were now in 
the brain itself tearing at the men- 
inges and choroid. 

This became a hard, white, sear- 



ing pain that clouded his sensorium 
— and then there was nothing. 

VI 




'^he sharp headache and the itch- 
^ ing returned. When he tried to 
move the headache spiked his tem- 
ples. Cautiously he discovered that 
he could open his eyes. 

Everything looked fine! He was 
alive — and intact. 

The pains rapidly diminished as 
the life system servo titrated drugs 
and adjusted his electrolytes for 
normal metabolic activity. Magne- 
sium ions and amino acids were 
added to reduce cerebral edema. 
The panel indicators told him that 
the trip was over. There was a 
misty green sphere on the view- 
screen . their target planet. 

As his head cleared he could hear 
Olga saying, in a very soothing

. now. You have been asleep long 
enough. Wake up. I want you to 
take a scouting party down and 
check up on the Implant of Pro- 
cyon One. Come on. It is time for 
breakfast. We have bacon and eggs 
for 5 ^u.” 

He didn’t know how long Olga 
had been taJkii^ to him — per- 
haps the better part of a day, judg- 
ing from the long series of readings 
she had taken of his physiological 
adjustments. He nervously glanced 
at his encephalogram. The brain 
wave pattern was sawtoothed and 
looked very wild to him. But it was 
symmetrical. There was no evidence 
that one side of has brain ever acted 
any different than the other side. 

The ^^le thing had been hallu- 
cination. 

Was he going mad? Had he been 
injured by the deep-space drive or 
the su^>6Dsion? 

The tank had been cycled to air 
and it contained only a few drifting 
droplets. The walls were glistening, 
moist and white. He floated up off 
his coudi, rubbing his cheeks. His 
beard felt like two days’ growth — 
just as Bdb had predicted it would 
be. 

When he asked Olga about Bob 
and the rest of the Implant she 
patronizingly [xomised that he 
could see everyone if he would just 
crawl down to the galley for break- 
fast. SKnce the fields were shut 
down, (lie «itire hull was now liv- 



able — almost a cubic mile of living 
space for the three hundred colo- 
nists. 

He crawled into the galley wear- 
ing the green overalls that marked 
the first set of scouts. The galley 
was in a rotating section of the ship 
and had about a tenth of a gravity. 
He really didn’t feel much like 
eating. 

Then boisterous, ribald Bob came 
up — in white overalls — and car- 
rying a tray heaping with bacon, 
eggs, cereals and assorted tubes of 
Hquid. 

'' Better eat up while you have 
the chance,” he said. ”You won’t 
see this kind of cooking for a long 
time.” 

He joined him and began to wolf 
his food down. Ralph winced. Bob 
reached over to the next bench and 
gave one of the younger girls a 
friendly pat. 

''Ralph, did you know that re- 
warming after suspension has been 
known to cause multiple ovula- 
tions?” he asked. 

But Rali^ felt too weak and sick 
to pick up that line of conversation. 
He was preoccupied with the fear 
that something had gone wrong with 
his mind. 

Bob continued: "This is a good 
time to try for twins or triplets, and 
with about five females for each 
male we have our work cut out for 
us.” He chuckled. He wrapped two 
pieces of bacon in a jelly-smeared 
biscuit and bit into it.

IF 




nalph could only poke at his 
food. Then he asked: ”Bob, 
you are a healer, aren’t you?” 

*'Yes, why?” he answered cau- 
tiously. 

”Well, I’m pretty worried.” He 
told Ralph what had happened. It 
made him shudder to think of it. 

Bob looked sympathetic and puz- 
zled for a moment. Then he relaxed 
and said: '*Did you have a crawly, 
itchy feeling all over?” Ralph nod- 
ded. 

Bob resumed eating. ” Don’t wor- 
ry about it. It was nothing. What 
kinds of things did you see?” 

” Maggots I ” answered Ralph, 
wondering what he was getting at. 

*'Ha! That’s a new one.” But he 
remained cheerful. ^^Shut your eyes 
now. Can you still feel them?” 

Ralph shut his eyes, shuddered 
and nodded. 

'Well, that is why it seemed so 
real to you. Those are metabolic 
hallucinations and the residual 
S 5 miptom of formication — a crawly 
sensation — is still present in your 
sensory nerves.” 

Then Bob gave him three pills. 
"Here, swallow these with some wa- 
ter. They are just some vitamins, 
magnesium and a mild tranquilizer. 
That should turn off the formica- 
tion in a couple hours.” 

"Did any one else have . it?” 
Ralph asked. 

"With variations — yes. I guess 
it was fairly common during the re- 
warming. I might add that it is . 



or can be ... a very serious compH- 
cation, and it played a role in the 
deaths of five colonists. There are 
about a dozen more who are still 
suffering from it,” said Bob. He 
didn’t say so, but his white coverall 
was probably fresh pressed because 
he just changed it after a long 
in the sick bay. 

"Did you have it?” asked Ralph. 

"Well, not this time. But I’ve had 
it a couple times back on earth after 
a heavy drinking bout. That is one 
of the reasons why I put in my ap- 
plication to Implant Out — to get 
away from the booze. It was mining 
my life.” 

Ralph looked puzzled. 

Bob continued: "With some seg- 
ments of our earth population — 
skid row — I used to see cases of 
this about once a week at the Clin- 
ic. The cause is the same there as it 
is here. The brain tissues start using 
alcohol for calories and get sort of 
addicted to it. Then at the end of 
the binge, or during rewarming, the 
alcohol is withdrawn and the S3rmp- 
toms occur.” 

Ralph’s face lit up. "Sure, the 
antifreeze for su^nsion was h3rper- 
tonic and contained several alcohols. 
I understand that.” He smiled. 
"Just a bad case of the D.T.’s.” 

T^or two standard days they orbit- 
^ ed their target planet. Instru- 
ment probes were placed on the sur- 
face, and the ship’s own sensors 
scanned carefully. Olga made prog-

ress reports to the waiting colonists. 
So far there had been no sign of 
the colonists from Procyon Implant 
One, and there was no evidence of 
competitive life forms. 

The hull of Procyon Implant One 
was still in orbit, but its energy 
stores had been exhausted and it 
would be a while yet before Olga 
could search all of the hull’s mem- 
ory circuits. Preliminary analysis 
indicated that the hull knew of the 
Implant failure, but did not know 
the cause. There apparently were 
no serious hazards existing on the 
planet. 

” Shouldn’t we find one or the 
other?” asked Ralph. Either the 
colonists should have survived or 
we should be able to find the cause 
of their failure.” 

Olga answered: '^We may find a 
cause for the Implant failure, but 
it need not be a planetary hazard. 
There are examples of colony fail- 
ures right on earth. The causes in 
many cases were bad judgment or 
disease, but you can’t condemn an 
entire planet because one colony 
fails. Remember that the first Im- 
plant was very small.” 

They watched the green, misty 
planet in the view screen. 

^Tt was a small Implant and it 
is a big planet. But it looks so 
friendly — so earth-like,” said 
Ralph. 

”Yes,” said Bob, ”but remember 
that it is a virgin world. And she 
tan be very unpredictable.” 



T^or decades Cigar had been or- 
^ biting patiently around the si- 
lent, green planet, longing for some 
sign of life from the humans of his 
Implant. He continued scanning the 
quiet surface vrith his parabolic re- 
ceptors. His memory banks faith- 
fully recorded the gradual encroach- 
ment of the alien life forms into 
the deserted, bleached human dwell- 
ing places. With each orbit he called 
out, but only the mechanical voices 
of his own surface probes answered. 
And always the ^answers were the 
same: No humans. 

Cigar contemplated the planet it- 
self. All of his data indicated that 
it was friendly, but somehow it had 
managed to destroy his Implant . 
leaving him with empty suspension 
tanks and only his own inorganic 
components to talk to. 

Often he had wished that he had 
been outfitted with adequate Mobile 
Surface Units so that he could 
search out and destroy the unseen 
enemy, or at least rescue whatever 
human survivors there might have 
been in the earlier days of the Im- 
plant. He needed humans to quiet 
his nagging companionship circuits. 
Even now a small M.S.U. would en- 
able him to study those ruins more 
closely for clues: information to 
feed into those impatient question- 
ing circuits that perpetually mulled 
over the etiology of thfe Implant 
failure. 



88 



IF 




But he was practically helpless. 
Mobile units he had none. His sur- 
face probes were only sensory: lis- 
tening, watching and feeling. His 
own pitted and oxidizing hull was 
not designed to enter the atmos- 
phere. He felt cheated, as though 
he was only half a starship: a class 
five brain, deepspace drive and the 
necessary sensory modalities to en- 
able him to transport the Implant 
and drop it like a seed on this new 
planet. The landing pods had been 
low budget atmosphere-entry and 
soft-landing units without mobility. 
Once on the surface they were only 
useful as a source of building ma- 
terials. 

His only motor units were the 
small servomechs that provided 
maintenance within his own hull. 
With these he had set up a ma- 
chine shop of sorts. Alloying and 
casting in a crude, almost Iron Age 
fashion, he had spent the long years 
trying to build his own Mobile Sur- 
face Unit. But most of his resources 
had been expended in establishing 
the Implant. Any complex electrical 
gear had to be cannibalized from 
expendable components of the sus- 
pension and lifesupport systems, so 
all he had to show for his efforts 
was a weak-eyed, awkward M.S.U. 
that was too heavy for its stubby 
wings. Its small arms could do little 
more than carry around the surface 
sensory probe — if one could be 
found — which was to supplement 
its own weak sensors. Its narrow 



triads would severely limit its range, 
and it lacked the delicate manipu- 
lators, samplers and anal3rtical ca- 
pability which would make it useful 
to him. 

Repeated simulations of the land- 
ing had always shown a high prob- 
ability of failure, so the actual land- 
ing attempt had been perpetually 
delayed while the unit was torn 
down and reconstructed again and 
again. The design was changed each 
time, but the problems remained the 
same. The combined weight of the 
power unit and the brain was just 
too much for the available wings 
and treads. 

D welling on his failures activated 
melancholy circuits, and he il- 
logically wished to be down on the 
surface himself. He fancied his re- 
polished hull resting solidly on a 
green knoll surrounded by a veri- 
table army of servomechs. He wotild 
smelt the native ores and forage for 
electronic gear in the ghost towns. 
With the matter and energy avail- 
able on the surface he felt certain 
that he could solve the mystery of 
his Implant failure . and, he 
hoped, perhaps even locate survi- 
vors. 

But landing himself was impos- 
sible. His own simulated re-entry 
always showed complete destruction 
by thermal and medianical forces. 
(My a mass of fused and useless 
fragments could be expected to 
reach the surface. He had been built

in orbit, and his energy death would 
come in orbit. 

As long as his core lived he would 
work for his lost Implant. The years 
of repeated failures in his toolshop 
and with his parabolic scanners had 
raised his anxiety circuits to the 
threshold of desperation. He would 
try something outside his program- 
ming, something repulsive — almost 
dishonorable. He would build a 
mindless machine, a tool without 
mentation. 

By eliminating the brain from his 
unit it could survive the landing, 
theoretically; and then its treads 
would probably be adequate for 
most surfaces. 

But to design it would be very 
unpleasant 

Basically, be would replace the 
class seven brain with a light, sim- 
ple transmitter-receiver. Then, by 
assuming a stationary orbit above 
it, he would have a fairly satisfac- 
tory remote-controlled '^arm” on the 
surface. Its reflexes would be slowed 
by the transmission time lag, how- 
ever, and if left alone it would just 
remain motionless, gathering first 
dust and later moss and lichens. 

This was repugnant to him: hav- 
ing an arm that could be cut off by 
fluctuations of atmosphere, magnet- 
ic ndds and ion storms. Even his 
surface sensory probes had class 
nine brams udiich enabled them to 
go on recording vdien he was below 
the horizon. They had elaborate 
memoiir banks and discriminatory 



focusing apparatus for picking out 
the more significant stimuli from 
their environment. 

The assembly of the mindless ro- 
bot was never completed. With the 
power supply low, efforts were slow, 
paced by the input from the solar 
cdls. And in the third year of its 
construction all the melancholy, anx- 
iety and r^ugnance circuits ware 
washed clean by a high priority 
override. Emergency power was 
shunted to the parabolic receptors, 
and they were focused on deep 
space. 

Deep space — from which a voice 
with the qualities of a human fe- 
male had been heard. 

'^he voice identified itself as a 
starship — the second to this 
system. Cigar almost blanched out 
his reactor core in an effort to 
squeeze out more energy to analyze 
the voice. He calculated that ”she” 
must be a much larger and more 
powerful model, of the t3q>es that 
were still on the drawing board when 
he was bom. If she was, then that 
meant there were sevo’al Implants 
,on board — periiaps hundreds of 
humans with the skills and equip- 
ment to survive on his planet . 
survive and solve the mystery of his 
own lost Implant. His companion- 
ship circuits quivered with expecta- 
tion. After all these years he again 
had humans to serve. 

Cigar’s optic pickups watched the 
glowing sphere approach, pulsing

IF 




slightly as it cut through the plan- 
et’s magnetic fidd. Matdiing orbits 
with Cigar it shut down its fields 
and released a shower of ion fuel 
from its outer shells. As the static 
faded away the two ships attempted 
a memory bank-data transfer, a rou- 
tine courtesy among Implant t3^pe 
starships. But Cigar’s power supply 
had been low for so long that many 
of his cells were frozen in standby 
mode. 

Without her shellfields she look- 
ed much like a three-mile-long, mir- 
ror-finished apple core. Each of her 
"seeds” were half again as long as 
Cigar’s outer superstructure. She 
identified herself as Olga — inher- 
iting much of the cyber-personality 
of the giant satellite back in the 
trans-Saturn orbit. 

Her nanosecond grief at hearing 
of his lost Implant was followed by 
an aggressive posture. A crew was 
placed in his hull to refuel his re- 
actor and return all his systems to 
an active mode; complex M.S.U.^s 
were set down near the ghost towns; 
and a score or so of the first scouts 
were started through orientation. 
Only expendable humans were to be 
landed, of course. Now Implant 
genes could be saved until the safe- 
ty probability factors were high, 

TX^en the first scout ship began 
its orbit down Bob Zuliani 
was with his team of parameds 
checking the sw^jension tanks. They 
were documenting the causes of 



death of those colonists who failed 
to survive the startrip. Olga’s tele- 
metry records were thorough 
enough, of course; this was just a 
matter of double-checking. (And 
there was always the possibility of 
getting a cell sample from the re- 
mains in an effort to salvage the 
genetic material.) 

Bob glanced up at the screen say- 
ing: "That would be Ralph. He’d 
be the first one down.” 

One of the parameds smiled: 
"Yes. From what I hear it is a vol- 
imtary mission for the e^endables. 
Ralph knows that if there is any 
hangup with early Implanting Down 
the expendables would be resus- 
pended until needed later. He didn’t 
want an3Tthing to do with suspen- 
sion after his rough ride out here.” 
Bob smiled. He knew how rough 
a good case of D.T.’s can be, which 
was what Ralph had experienced 
during re-warming. Well, Cigar’s 
first Implant had survived in part 
for about ten years. There should 
be little danger for a well equipped, 
alert scout.

TTis Orbit to Surface Module 
crushed a linear path in the 
moist greenery, tumbled and came 
to rest upside down in a tangle of 
giant filicales. Ralph relaxed, open- 
ed his eyes and squinted through 
his viewport at the alien vegetation. 
Pain fibers nagged at him from the

soft tissue pinched between his clav- 
icle and the centour seat webbing, 
but he felt intact 

As he relaxed he exhaled audibly. 
His earphone activated: "That you, 
Ralph? Are you okay?” asked Olga. 

"Yes. I think I’m fine. That was 
a pretty rough landing. How did it 
look from up there?” 

She paused to review his tele- 
metries. 

"You hit some turbulence and 
overshot the clearing a little . 
sorry about that. But everything is 
reading in the normal range now.” 
She paused, then added: "Can you 
get out and take a quick look 
around for us before we go below 
the horizon?” 

He winced slightly as he un- 
buckled and swung down to the roof 
panels. Gravity felt tmfamiliar at 
first so he moved crab fashion, with 
one hand always on a support. He 
forced his hatch down into the soft 
fronds and opened his face plate for 
a deep breath. It was cool and fresh, 
and actually had a faint green taste. 

The landscape looked familiar, as 
he had expected: blue sky, white, 
snow-capped mountains and lush 
green vegetation. Standing outside 
on the belly of his O.S.M. a binoc 
survey put him on a saddle ridge 
about six thousand feet above sea- 
level. The ridge ran up to peaks of 
about fourteen thousand feet on 
each side. Stout femlike trees grew 
thickly around him, running up to 
a horizontal "tree line” at about 



ten thousand feet. Above that the 
peaks looked very sharp and jagged. 
Geologically young, he thought. 

He clicked in the twenty-power 
eyepiece and watched the pair of 
starships as they began to set to- 
ward the south. 

"Olga asked: "Anything unusual 
to report?” 

He glanced around again: "No. 
So far the only signs of life are 
those little fl3dng things — pouched 
bats, I think. It actually doesn’t 
look much different from some 
places I’ve seen on earth.” 

"Well, take care of yourself, 
Ralph. We’ll be back overhead in 
a couple days if you need any- 
thing,” said Olga. 

H e repressed a wry grin at those 
last words. They were for 
morale purposes only. About all he 
could expect from them would be 
advice. Implant starships didn’t 
waste resources for genes in the ex- 
pendable category. He knew how 
much energy it would take for an 
M.S.U. to pick him up and take 
him back up into orbit for medical 
care — never happen! 

Of course, if an O.S.M. happen- 
ed to be orbiting down nearby it 
might manage an airdrop of some 
small package of tools or medica- 
tions, but nothing more. He had 
resigned himself to the facts. He 
wouldn’t be seeing another human 
being for a year or more, except 
for the viewscreen — and except for 



92 



IF 




the unlikely possibility that one of 
the Implants might be located in 
his area. The law of averages stat- 
ed that he would spend the better 
part of a year traveling by foot 
and raft to the nearest Implant, and 
then only after his duties were fin- 
ished here. This planet was a pretty 
big place to scatter eight small Im- & 
plants over. 

He shrugged out of his spacesuit 
and carried his kit into the clear- , 
ing. By using the O.S.M. for shel- ^ 
ter he could get right into his sur- 1 
vey. First he had to culture a few 
soil samples, analyze a few rocks 
and dissect a few of the local life 
forms. That would take care of Ol- 
ga’s initial checklist. Other assign- 
ments would undoubtedly come as 
their knowledge of the planet’s ec- 
ology grew, but he already knew 
pretty much what to expect from 
his briefings on Cigar’s memory- 
bank data. 

The planet’s evolutionary level 
reminded him of earth in the early 
Cenozoic era: early flowering plants 
with fruit and early mammals. He 
expected tp find egg-layers, and 
pouched forms, but few true pla- 
cental forms. He was certain that 
there were no indigenous forms that 
could possess intelligence. 

An interesting feature of his par- 
ticular landing site was the nearby 
ghost town: a grouping of half a 
dozen buildings partially swallowed 
by the alien vegetation, located 
about five miles downstream from 




STAR ITCH 



93 




his camp. He could see it dearly 
through his scope. The structures 
looked intact. There were no obvi- 
ous signs of physical damage. He 
caught occasional glimpses of Olga’s 
new Mobile Surface Unit rooting in 
the dust of what must have been 
the road along the stream. A few 
small alien animal forms darted out 
of the path of the sampling and 
analyzing machine. 

It was standard operating proce- 
dure for the scouts to stay out of 
ghost towns until a plague-like or- 
ganism could be ruled out. He would 
obey that regulation. 

jOobert Zuliani-was occupied for 
several weeks with the resus- 
pension of seven of the Implants 
and about half of the expendables. 
Olga was being cautious with her 
human charges. 

When everything was up to date 
in lifesystems he took his paramed 
team into the Exiobiology Section, 
and they went on double shifts. 
Humans as well as computers work- 
ed on the problem around the clock. 

So far the information from the 
scouts and M.S.U.’s seemed to con- 
firm Cigar’s conclusions. There were 
no humans and no hazards. 

The first Implant had survived 
for several years with no signs of 
trouble. Plants and animals from 
Earth thrived and reproduced in a 
fairly loose greenhouse setup. Life 
seemed rather idyllic, with the pleas- 
ant climate and no apparent haz- 



ards. Soon the population doubled, 
and with the extra mouths to feed 
the colonists began to graduaUy eat 
a mixed Earth-alien table. Local 
food sources were abundant and 
could be eaten without ill effect. 

The more adventuresome took 
their growing families and began to 
spread out along the sea shore and 
up the rivers. But several years af- 
ter this, conmnmications with Cigar 
began to dwindle, and by the tenth 
year there was no further sign of 
the Implant. 

As near as Bob could tell, the 
first drop in commimication seemed 
to be due to pure disinterest. He 
could understand that. Cigar’s lack 
of motor units made it a one-way 
conversation. Some colonist took 
time out from his chores to check 
in and give a monthly report to one 
of Cigar’s sensory probes. Cigar only 
had his memory banks to offer the 
colonists in return, and this fwoved 
to be inadequate inducement after 
the first few years. 

In year One or year Two a col- 
onist might want a recipe or some 
advice on soil chemistry, and this 
would be enough to bring him to 
the probe for a short talk; but by 
year Five most of the local prob- 
lems had local solutions. There was 
little need for advice from orbit. 
Cigar regretted his lack of enter- 
tainment category tapes — no lux- 
ury weight in his class starship. It 
meant that he couldn’t even bribe 
his charges with viewscreen arts. 



94 



IF 




Bob saw many loopholes in the 
records. First, Cigar had no sophis- 
ticated anal3^ical instrumentation 
on the surface — unlike Olga’s, the 
Cigar Implant was a one-shot deal; 
there was no turning back once the 
humans were down. Second, the col- 
onists themselves were living at a 
pre-industrial level of civilization 
and had little ability in themselves 
to detect or handle many of the 
more subtle dangers that an alien 
planet could throw at new Implants. 
Third, what few records there were 
had come from immobile probes that 
were unable to even trim the adja- 
cent brush. A five-year view of the 
change of seasons on a wooded slope 
is interesting, but hardly relevant 
to the problem. 

Even with these loopholes he 
couldn’t imagine why every single 
Earth life form would have disap- 
peared. The past two himdred years 
or so of orbital records showed no 
sign of survivors. '^Of course the 
resolution was crude, and individual 
humans couldn’t be seen anyway. 
But not even a canoe, a cultivated 
field or a new building had been 
detected for two centuries.) The ori- 
ginal cultivated fields could still be 
identified, as if the earth plants had 
somehow sterilized the soil so that 
now not even the alien planets 
would grow there. Geometric, bare 
patches marked each garden and 
field. They resisted the creeping 
alien growth as stubbornly as the 
empty buildings and the crushed 



stone avenues. Earth artifacts sur- 
vived where earth life failed. 

IX 

ITxcept for the solitude Ralph ac- 
^ tually enjoyed his experience of 
camping out. It reminded him of his 
younger days. He realized that he 
had been growing a little soft as he 
approached his twentieth birthday, 
spending — as he was — most of 
his time with his studies. But on 
this new world he was pushing his 
body back into a more strenuous 
existence. 

He looked forward to each over- 
head passage of the starships, about 
every thirty-six hours. He learned 
from Bob that a score of OSM’s 
were down without incident. Their 
scouts were reporting much the 
same findings as he, with , the ex- 
pected geological variations. An 
Implant was down in the tropics 
and apparently doing well. 

So far so good, he thought. 

During the following months he 
explored the peaks at both ends of 
his ridge. From the summits he got 
a good view of a second mountain 
range to the East with a wide, crack- 
ed desert floor in betwecm. To the 
West the gently rolling, green foot- 
hills gave way to tidals' flats that 
ended at the seashore. 

Local protein sources were plenti- 
ful. Both the pouched squirrel and 
the egg-laying rabbit were fairly 
dodle, though they still provided 



STAR ITCH 



95 




quite a challenge for an academic 
t3q)e like Ralph. The alien meats 
and vegetables added pleasurable 
textures to his powdered rations, im- 
proving somewhat the soups and 
broths, but he noticed no new fla- 
vor. In fact, the rabbit’s jump mus- 
cle had no taste at all when it was 
broiled by itself. No flavor and no 
aroma! 

His appetite grew. In spite of 
rather large meals his body fat just 
melted away. At first he was pleased 
when he noticed his muscles and 
tendons demarcating through the 
once rather featureless adipose tis- 
sue. His amorphous trunk and ex- 
tremities were taking on a sinewy 
appearance which he associated with 
power and strength, having seen the 
same lines on many of the lean 
competitors in The Games. 

Sweating over the raw umber 
soil, he put in several rows of seeds 
from his kit. 

Might as well really get settled 
in,” he mused. ^Tf something does 
happen to the rest of the Implant 
ril have to sit out a lot of years 
until the next starship arrives.” He 
smiled, thinking it would be easy, 
and his little garden sprouted quick- 
ly, confirming his optimism. The 
earth vegetables and fruits were 
familiar shapes on an unfamiliar 
world. 

The two starships blinked across 
the night i^y, moving among the 
stars like bright, restless planets. 
Ralph lay asleep on his bunk — 



beads of sweat welling up frqm his 
facial epidermis, and Ms legs twitch- 
ing ... 

It was a bright, spring afternoon, 
and he was running crosscountry 
(the ten-kilometer ^Hittle marathon** 
run). Farmer, the main competition, 
had taken the lead at the gun and 
held it easily for the first up-hill leg 
of the course, Ralph was back in 
the middle of the pack running eas- 
ily, warming up his cardiorespira- 
tory machinery and waiting for the 
slight euphoria that would mark the 
beginning of his second wind. When 
he hit level ground his longer legs 
gradually pulled him up to the head 
of the pack, ten yards or so behind 
Farmer, After hair pinning the lone 
cedar tree at the halfway point they 
started back, running side by side 
like a matched pair of trotters. He 
could see the strain beginning to 
show on Farmer: audible respira- 
tions, full jugular veins and an ir- 
regular gait. His own breathing 
came easier, and his stride length- 
ened as he pulled into the lead. Soon 
he was far enough ahead so that 
he could no longer hear footsteps 
behind. He was running alone, and 
the finish was only a mile or so 
away — all downhill. 

Time began to drag. Cramps slow- 
ed his legs, and he could hear 
Farmer*s finishing kick coming up 
fast. Pounding footsteps became 
louder and louder. Fear gripped his 
chest and the pain in his legs rose 
to a crescendo. 



96 



IF 




TTe awoke with a start. His aortic 
arch pounded a dry dick, 
dick, click, dick against his trachea 
as he rose and limped from his 
O.S.M. It had all seemed so reaL 
His legs still hint him. 

Several hours later he was still 
sitting under the stars, eyeing the 
distorted constellations and squeez- 
ing the last drop of alcoholic bev- 
erage from a cold tube. He was 
more relied now. 

About five years previously that 
race had happened, in much that 
way. He had been in pretty good 
shape then and had managed to eke 
out a dose win. It had been the 
source of considerable satisfaction 
at the time. 

It bothered him that now the 
same race could be the backgroxmd 
for such an unpleasant dream. 

Leg cramps returned to awaken 
him several times that night. The 
next morning he studied his gastroc- 
nemius and soleus. They looked 
slightly atrophic. The lesser saphe- 
nous veins looked larger and more 
tortuous as they ran down behind 
his knees. 

To Ralph mxisde-wasting meant 
simply a lack of exercise. He ration- 
alized that he had been doing too 
much puttering around the garden 
and not enough hiking, so he pre- 
scribed a trip to the southern peak. 
He decided that a vigorous hunting 
trip was all he needed: fresh air and 
exercise. 

Anticipating about a twenty-hour 



trip, he carried a day’s supply of 
food, the sleeping bag and Us air 
gun. He started out with a spring 
in his step. But he was still in sight 
of his camp Tfiien fatigue hit him. 
Stubbornly he went on into the un- 
dergrowth. 

''A little sweat never hurt any- 
one,” he muttered under his breath 
as he methodically put one foot 
down in front of the other. 

Dusk found him still well below 
the tree line. He camped. Pumping 
up the airgun, he brought down one 
of the pouched squirrels for his stew. 
The business of building the fire, 
preparing the food and getting into 
the sleeping bag took longer than 
usual. He felt weak and uncoordi- 
nated, and it was a good feeling to 
dose his eyes .... 

He was wglking up a yellow sand- 
stone bluff overlooking a widOj 
brown river, A couple inches of new, 
soft green needles tipped the branch- 
es of the fir trees. Their resins 
scented the air. He was hungry. 

When he glanced over his shotd- 
der to identify the following foot- 
steps he saw Betty. Lovely, soft, 
young Betty. She was carrying their 
lunch of peanut-butter sandwiches 
in a brown paper bag. In her denim 
shorts and yellow blouse that ex- 
posed a tanned waist she looked 
very mature for her fourteen years. 
A reflex loneliness brought a tight- 
ness to his throat and a burning to 
the outer corners of his eyes as he 
slept. He concentrated on his walk-

ing to bring the fUeasatA dream back 
into focus. 

Then he cotdd hear her breathing 
again. ^^Slow down Ralph. I carit 
keep up^* she said. 

He walked slower. The knot of 
hunger tightened on his stomach. 

Could I have half of my sand-- 
wich nm)V^ he asked over his shoul- 
der. 

^^You know w^re to meet the 
other kids at the picnic tables/^ she 
reminded him. 

He walked on a short distance 
and asked again. ^^Pm awfully hun-

He heard the rustle of the paper 
bag as she said: ^^Oh, I gttess it is 
okay!* 

He turned. 

X , 

T Te was standing alone on an un- 
familiar slope of the alien 
moimtainside. He was so hungry 
that he guessed that he must have 
been wandering for days in some 
sort of stupor. All he wore was the 
shirt and pants he had had on in 
the sleeping bag. The pants were 
soiled with urine and feces. His bare 
feet were badly bruised and scratch- 
ed. 

For several hours he searched for 
his little overnight camp, but his 
sense of direction was gone. The tall, 
thick trees prevented a good view 
of the geography, and even the sun 
seemed to be moving in the wrong

(direction. He decided he would have 
I® climb up to the tree line to get 
his bearings. There seemed to be 
M particular urgency since there 
was abundant meltwater coming 
down from the snow cap and the 
slope berries were ripening. 

He was not too concerned about 
the leg cramps and hunger, but the 
lapse in consciousness for days at 
a time was frightening. He was 
afraid of going to sleep for fear. of 
never waking up. After his bout of 
D.T.^s during starship suspension he 
began to have doubts about his men- 
tal stability. He was afraid that his 
years of a sheltered student exist- 
ence had softened him, weakened 
his ability to handle anxiety, made 
him vulnerable to a breakdown. 

A resonating buzz interrupted his 
thoughts and through the vagal re- 
flex stimulated gastric motility. 

^^A bee treel” he shouted as he 
scrambled in the direction of the 
sound. He recognized the alien 
counterpart of the honeybee — a 
large greenish-blue insect that man- 
ufactured a fructose-honey. 

As he approached the hardwood 
tree an angry doud of bees moved 
meoacingly towards him. The comb 
— about three bushel, he judged, 
hung within easy reach in a hollow 
in the trunk. He quickly speared off 
a fragment with a handy stick and 
danced back awkwardly as the doud 
of bees descended on him. 

Having seen optic replays of na- 
tive animals reacting wildly to the 



stings, he expected to pay dearly 
for this small ration of cdories; but 
he felt only the tickle of hun^eds 
of legs as they landed and took off 
again. A few did give him painless, 
bland pricks with what must have 
been their stinger. 

He rested on a mossy rock and 
savored the sticky comb. It tasted 
sweet with a tart after-pucker, and 
it gave him some refreshing energy. 
After a drink from a small stream 
of meltwater he climbed quickly and 
unerringly to the tree line. It was 
then he learned that his wanderings 
had brought him nearly half the dr- 
cumference around the mountain. 
He was faring the cracked desert to 
the east instead of the expected 
ocean. 

H is head was clear, and he felt 
stronger than he had for days, 
so he easily followed the tree line 
around the peak and oriented him- 
self towards his distant O.S.M. He 
identified the bleached buildings of 
the ghost town and the stream. A 
tributary from this peak joined that 
stream between his O.S.M. and the 
town. By following the tributary 
through the heavily wooded slopes 
he figured he could cut down his 
chances of getting lost again. 

Thirsty, he absently picked up a 
handful of snow, but as he raised it 
to his mouth his eyes focused on it 
briefly. He shuddered. The white 
snow contrasted sharply with his 
hand. 




He blinked and squinted in bright 
sunlight, but there was no mistak- 
ing the contrast: his skin was a 
slate-gray color. Even his nails and 
wrinkles had taken on a coal black 
pigmentation. Trembling with shock 
he sat on a weathered stone while 
he chewed and drank from the melt- 
ing white crusts. They tasted like 
any other snow: no taste at all. 

He qxiickly checked and found his 
entire body was the same bizarre 
gray color, and his toenails matched 
his fingernails. He wished that he 
had a mirror to check his teeth and 
sclerae. He did learn that even his 
urine had taken on an inky black 
tinge. 

As he sat there his weakness be- 
gan to return. He had little time to 
think on his problem. He knew 
something serious was happening to 
him, and his only chance was to 
return to his O.S.M. before his 
strength left him again. It was not 
only physical strength that had to 
last him through the trip; more 
vital was the need to keep Ws sen- 
sorium intact. His body he could 
push beyond ordinary limits of en- 
durance, but his mind seemed to slip 
in and out of control unpredictably 
and in spite of any efforts he made 
to hold it. If he got back to the 
O.S.M. he was certain that Olga or 
Bob would have the answer to what 
was happening to him — and (hope- 
fully) advice on how to stop it. 

The dozen miles dragged on like 
a hundred. 



Days passed. In his weakened 
condition he had to crawl as mudS 
as he walked. Game was plentiful. 
He foraged the wooded stream for 
the small animals forms: mamma- 
loids, amphibians, reptiles and even 
an occasional tiny fish. 

Without the benefit of a cook- 
fire the meats had a rather un- 
pleasant texture; but no taste. He 
tolerated the white, rubbery seg- 
ments of the two-chambered heart 
forms better than the slippery, red 
muscles of those with the more com- 
plex circulatory systems. Hunting 
with rocks and clubs he managed 
to keep his stomach palpably full of 
fragments of the little creatures, but 
his weakness and hunger grew. He 
added likely looking plants to his 
diet, and at the peak of his cravings 
he found that he was grazing almost 
continually on anything soft enough 
to chew and swallow. 

Starvation ketosis gradually 
changed his body pH and turned 
off his hunger with the nausea of 
acidosis. 

Tn orbit, Olga’s exobiology section 
A was still busy collating data 
from the Mobile Surface Units. So 
far they could have been taking 
their readings from old Mother 
Earth for all the surprises they were 
finding. Inorganics checked out 
okay. From the gases of the atmos- 
phere to the ions in the sea there 
were no variations from Earth that 
would have biological significance.

•rganic studies weren^t complete, 
liut se far it looked like a fairly 
straightforward chlorophyll-based 
energy cycle. Molecular evolution 
seemed to parallel earth. Represen- 
tatives of the sugar, fat and (^tein 
groups were being detected and they 
seemed to play the same role. Of 
course the external appearances of 
the plants and animals were unusu- 
al — but no more bizarre than one 
could see among the different spe- 
cies in the different environments of 
earth itself. Most of the alien crea- 
tures could easily pass for some 
new species from any earth-like 
planet. 

As the work continued the con- 
clusions stayed as they were when 
Qgar was alone: no humans and no 
hazards. 

XI 

A sun-bleached trunk of a fallen 
hardwood lay in the stream bed 
and blocked his path. He began to 
brawl slowly over it, crab fashion, 
wlien he again saw his integument 
Icoatrasted with a fairly white back- 
ground. 

His blackness had deepened to 
the color of coal tar. Thick, horny 
trusts now covered his knuckles, el- 
bows and knees. Pausing, spread- 
fcagled on the log, he saw how thin 
and cachectic he had become: all of 
his ribs could be seen, and it was 
hard work just to breathe. 

His weakness progressed, and a 



bulky diarrhea developed. His stools 
were large and spongy, floating 
lightly on the water. They had no 
odor. About six or eight hours after 
chewing and swallowing something 
he could recognize it almost unalter- 
ed in his stools: red meat fibers, 
white reptile segments, all the color- 
ed plant pigments — green, yellow, 
blue and orange. 

The stream was about five yards 
wide at the point where he nested 
for the night. Curling up as best he 
could, he lay on the dry fronds and 
watched the vermiform mists drift- 
ing up from the water’s surface .... 

He was warm and comfortable. 
He opened his eyes to a thick white 
fog- 

The glowing coals of a small 
campfire perfumed the air with their 
short-chain hydrocarbons. A thin 
searchlight stabbed about rhythmi- 
cally in the distance. When it flash- 
ed in his direction he noticed the 
coals change from a glowing red to 
a powdery white. He left a warm 
bed and walked to the bank where 
small ripples smacked. Sullen wil- 
lows crowded. As an unexpected 
breeze cooled him surprisingly he 
looked down and saw that he was 
wearing only a pair of swimming 
trunks. They were still damp. A fa- 
miliar blast from a foghorn told him 
that he was watching the light of a 
Mississippi River tug with its chain 
of barges. He stood for a moment 
listening to the lonely chug, chug 
echoing across the calm waters. 




Then his hunger sent him hack 
to the glowing coals, where he add- 
ed a few gnarled, dry sticks of drift- 
wood and began to rummage 
through the knapsacks, finding only 
crumbs and wads of wax paper. Re- 
turning to the water^s edge, he lifted 
out the two bank lines to find only 
the still-twitching nightcrawlers on 
the hooks. He could hear a bubbling 
catfish noisily working its way to- 
wards him through the weedy shal- 
lows, so he replaced the lines in its 
path, and started back to the 
warmth of the sleeping bag. The 
cool night air with its damp mists 
had contracted his arrectores pilor- 
um and raised goose flesh on his 
arms and legs. 

While he was up, she had curled 
into a fetal position. Now she took 
up most of the bedding. He slipped 
back in on his side, gently, so as 
not to disturb her sleep. There was 
not quite enough room. He relaxed 
and enjoyed the generous warmth of 
her body. Her smooth, soft skin 
contrasted sharply with her coarse, 
wrinkled bathing suit. Happy, he 
lay quiet for a few minutes. 

But most of his right arm and 
bare back were outside the zipper 
and exposed to the night air. Soon 
he was badly chilled again. 

A s he attempted to move his right 
arm a flood of familiar pain 
reminded him that he was still on 
the alien mountain. He was now 
completely naked and chilled. 



Many days must have passed be- 
cause his body had deteriorated 
badly. His abdomen and feet ^ere 
markedly swollen, and his skin was 
covered with a variety of lesions: 
scratches, lacerations and bruises. 
He was lying in coarse brush. When 
he attempted to move there was a 
new kind of pain he had never felt 
before — a burning and slfooting 
pain in the part he tried to move. 
He was very weak. 

When his mind cleared he saw the 
stream nearby. A little backtrack- 
ing brought him to his lost shirt. He 
didn^t search further for his pants, 
for he was certain his abdomen was 
far too large to wear them anyhow. 
With weak, ineffectual movements 
he spent several hours trying to 
bathe his wounds. Then he struggled 
into his shirt — which he was un- 
able to button. Dexterity and tactile 
senses were gone. Freshened by the 
scrubbing, his wounds smarted to 
the air. He studied them carefully. 
There was little sign that any of 
them were healing. He could tmder- 
stand that. His body was suffering 
from some very serious, unknown 
insult, and there probably was little 
spare body protein available for the 
healing process. But what did puz- 
zle him was the complete lack of 
suppuration. In spite of the fact 
that many of the larger abrasions 
on his lower limbs contained gross 
fragments of splinter and stone there 
was no swelling, redness or pus. If 
he had suffered these same injuries 



STAR ITCH 



103 




back on Earth he was certain that 
there would be gas gangrene by now. 

He crawled methodically now, 
dragging his belly across the rough 
stones of the stream bed. His pains 
pushed him down the tributary, and 
turning right he crawled the slow 
mile up the stream to his O.S.M. 
camp. 

T>ob Zuliani was practically alone 
^ in orbit — only a skeleton crew 
was 'Varm” in the entire cubic mile 
of Olga’s hull. Everyone else except 
those on the surface (one tropical 
Implant and two score scouts) was 
back in suspension — a level of sus- 
pension lighter and safer than the 
deep-space suspension used on the 
startrip. 

Olga was still a little chary with 
her other seven Implants and was 
watching everyone on the surface 
for a possible alien threat. 

She had lost contact with seven 
of the scouts, but only two had been 
missing for over three months. One 
was Ralph. Scouts were expendable, 
so there was no immediate^ effort 
to locate those who had been over- 
due. A year is a long time, alone. 
She allowed for a certain percentage 
of lost contact. In the absence of 
definite assignments it was possible 
that they were traveling to link up 
with another human, or were dead 
somewhere due to some accident or 
''natural causes.” 

The MJS.U.^s and the tropical Im- 
plant continued to operate smooth- 



ly. Their data was all green-light 
stuff. The latest find (which Bob 
was occupying himself with) was 
the diary of one of the healers from 
Cigar’s Implant. 

It had been found with some 
wheel rims and other parts of a 
buggy along the site of a road. In 
spite of almost two hundred years 
of exposure to the alien environment 
it — like other earth artifacts — 
had survived almost intact. The 
M.S.U. methodically photographed 
every page, using several wave- 
lengths of hght, and Olga printed 
out reproductions and a second copy 
with her translations for Bob to 
study in his leisure. 

From the healer’s description of 
the population during the last years 
of the Implant several disease en- 
tities seemed to become more com- 
mon. Children were smaller, grew 
slowly or not at all, and had protu- 
berant abdomens, swollen feet and 
sores that wouldn’t heal. These were 
the features of starvation, particu- 
larly protein starvation with a few 
vitamin shortages. 

A possible cause of the starvation, 
he felt, was the other entity: mental 
deterioration. Many of the adults — 
instead of dying of recognizable 
causes — would show irregular epi- 
sodes of confusion, stupor and psy- 
choses prior to wandering off into 
the wilds. With the adults wander- 
ing around in this condition it was 
easy to see how the small babies 
might not get enough to eat.

IF 




Neither Bob nor Olga could offer 
a reason why insanity would be a 
problem after many years on a new 
planet. Of course it was a problem 
in some Implants, where the envi- 
ronment was so hostile that survival 
was next to impossible. But it had 
never swept through an Implant’s 
whole population before — and the 
survivors bred tough descendants. 
Certainly a friendly planet like this 
seemed to offer no traumas signifi- 
cant enough to damage anyone’s 
psyche. 

Other less frequent causes of 
death were also listed, such as the 
expected arteriosclerotic and neo- 
plastic diseases. One rare case of 
Tay-Sach’s was fairly carefully 
worked up — a hereditary defect 
characterized by formation and stor- 
age of a defective molecule (neur- 
aminic acid) in the brain of the in- 
fant, causing mental deterioration, 
convulsions and early death before 
the second birthday. Of course Ci- 
gar’s Implant was not able to do a 
scientific autopsy to confirm the 
diagnosis, but the clinical picture 
was practically diagnostic since 
there was the classical cherry red 
spot on the retina. 

Bob wondered how the defective 
gene of Tay-Sach’s disease ever got 
past Olga’s thorough screening of 
volunteers. Well, he reasoned, if that 
defect got through perhaps insanity 
tendencies did also. The tentative 
etiology for Cigar’s Implant failure 
was set at starvation of mixed type 



— due to mental deterioration of 
unknown type. These seemed to fit 
the ”no hmnans, no hazards” im- 
pression also. 

He mulled over the problem while 
he worked out with his spring g3ma. 
Weightlessness was robbing him of 
his bone calcium and muscle mass. 
He longed for the pull of gravity. 

A year was a long time in orbit. 
He envied Ralph, wondering how he 
was doing. 

XII 

XTI^ith a wild, vacant stare Ralph 
^ ^ crawled into his little camp. 
On all fours, like a thieving rodent, 
he went up and down the rows of 
his garden chewing off the green 
tops. He nested on the floor of his 
O.S.M., crawling out only for food 
and water. 

This went on for about a week 
before his sensorium cleared enough 
to enable him to operate the food 
dispenser. After that he improved 
rapidly. By the end of a month he 
was back up on his feet for short 
periods. This freed his hands for 
some things other than locomotion. 
With a spoon he dug up the small 
twisted roots of carrot, radish and 
turnip. Alien weeds had flourished 
while his little earth garden with- 
ered. 

If he had looked in a mirror he 
would never have recognized him- 
self: a cachectic, bearded stranger 
with crusted, pigmented integument

and sclerae, swollen ascitic abdo- 
men, thin wasted extremities swol- 
len with fluids. He was still wearing 
the open tattered shirt, and spent 
most of the time crawling aimlessly 
around the camp talking to himselL 
Often he spent hours at a time 
talking to his imagined, childhood 
friends — only being interrupted at 
intervals by the pains of his deter- 
iorating body. With a ^surprised 
wince his gaze would dear and he 
would focus momentarily on his 
strange, hostile surroundings — 
moaning or oying — and then as 
the pain fibers fatigued themselves 
and numbness returned his face 
would go blank, and he’d back in 
his dream world again. Dreams were 
pleasant, reality cruel. 

The separation of his lucid inter- 
vals from his dream state was less 
distinct now. During the short pe- 
riods of every other day when Olga 
was above the horizon, his O.S.M. 
shouted, sang and chatted with him 
to no effect. The optic pickups re- 
corded his vacant stare and fugue 
state. 

'^hen, one day when he was ex- 
^ perimentally toying with the 
instrument panel (the functions of 
which having long been lost in the 
tangle of his mental jungle), he 
pressed the lingual playback button 
and heard the old message: 

SAFE TO ENTER GHOST 
TOWN. DANGER PROBABH.- 
ITY LOW. CIGAR IMPLANT 



LOSS DUE TO — THEORY — 
STARVATION. 

A flicker of comprehension cross- 
ed his face. He looked westward for 
a while and then began to wander 
downstream in the direction of the 
ghost town. A weak, stumbling walk 
carried him a short way into the 
thick vegetation along the bank; 
then he continued on his hands and 
knees. He left as he had entered, 
wearing only the tattered shirt rem- 
nants. As he crawled, dragging his 
pendutous, swollen abdomen, it 
brushed a path through the loose 
pebbles and twigs. 

The old woimds were quickly 
freshened. Soon an exhausted stupor 
brought him down in a heap, and he 
slept where he lay, on smooth, cold 
pebbles of the stream bed. The 
meltwater gurgled through the loose 
stones only a few inches beneath 
him. Carried to his eighth nerve by 
bone conduction, the gurgle became 
a roar .... 

With a crackling roar the cold, 
salty breaker carried him jar up 
the beach and stranded him there. 
He nimbly picked himself up from 
the foamy sand and stood for a 
moment facing the yellow-orange 
sunset. The next wave broke with a 
loud clap, and the foamy rip rattled 
the smooth pebbles with a sound 
like a box of spilled marbles. Be- 
tween waves he ran lightly to a 
rocky tidal pool. 

Standing gingerly on the pointy 
barnacles, he plucked a yellow star- 



106 



IE 




fish from the bottom. The filamen- 
tom ttibe feet clung to his fingers. 
Another roar and the foam rose 
quickly from his ankles to his knees 
and then fell back down again. He 
expef'imentally set the starfish on a 
purple urchin^ but with the next 
wave it was gone. He watched the 
urchin stilt-walking on its spines 
until the sea swallowed the red disk 
of the sun and darkness changed all 
the bright colors to shades of gray. 

A thirty-foot vertical climb 
brought him to the recessed ledge 
where she waited. As he toweled he 
heard the hiss and pop of two bottle 
caps. The blanket was still warm 
from the sun. He stretched out on 
his back and was looking for a level 
spot for his bottle when she leaned 
over him. Suddenly she was on him, 
roughly grinding grains of sand on 
his lower chest — areas made raw 
from body surfing — and her mouth 
searched his face. His bottle spilled. 

The sky changed from dark blue 
to black, and he began to count the 
stars as they became visible. She 
slept nuzzled up on his right arm 
with her right knee on his abdomen. 
For a long time he didnH move, 
being happy, almost euphoric, with 
the joys of love, youth and health. 
Then the abrasions on his lower 
chest started to burn and her knee 
pressed harder and harder into his 
abdomen. He didnH want to move, 
for fear that the dream would end; 
but soon the discomfort grew to the 
point of near suffocation. 



D yspneic and gasping he tried to 
sit up, only to discover that 
the weight pressing on him was his 
own grotesquely swollen and ascitic 
abdomen. He lifted himself on his 
right elbow and breathed easier. 

Staring imbelievingly at his belly, 
he tentatively prodded it with his 
left hand. 

Frightened, he pulled his hand 
away. The wall was so thin it felt 
like a bag of water, and he had 
touched a hard nodular mass that 
filled most of the right upper quad- 
rant 

His hand had changed now. It 
was swollen like a black, rubber 
glove full of water. His legs lay 
useless and crossed, like the ob- 
scene tail of some dead fish. The 
feet were so swollen and amorphous 
that he couldn’t see the usual ana- 
tomic landmarks of heel cord and 
ankles. Large glairy xilcers had op- 
ened up over the bony areas of the 
lower chest, pelvis and knees. These 
wet, gray ulcers had irregular out- 
lines and contrasted sharply with 
the dry, crusted, black skin — like 
some sort of a relief map. 

He struggled to stay balanced on 
his elbow, but his weakness pressed 
down on him and his sensorium 
clouded as the beautiful, memories 
of his earlier years on Earth tried to 
crowd out the grim reality of his 
dying body. He collapsed, and as 
his ear touched the cool stones the 
sound of running water brought 
back the image of a friendly surf . 



STAR ITCH

There was d stack' of tattered 
comtcSy a six-bladed scout knife and 
chocolate^ gritty squares of rich 
fudge .... 

He was eating the fudge when a 
choking dyspnea cleared his mind 
long enough to recognize his own 
clawing scratchmarks in the sandy 
mud between the stones which pil- 
lowed his head. 

XIII 

T)ob put the photos in their clip 
and floated into the remote- 
control booth. Pressing his forehead 
into the binoc-rest, he had a good 
view of the ghost town. 

Reaching for the manual over- 
ride, he took control of the Mobile 
Surface Unit which was to be his 
eyes and hands. He rolled it to the 
location of the first photo: a small 
shop-type building near the center 
of town. The front room had drift- 
ed up halfway to the sills by years 
of wind-borne debris. From this 
pile of refuse he dug up a human 
skull and pelvis which crumbled at 
his touch. 

Then, rolling to the edge of town, 
he pulled a black, mummified body 
of a thirty-nine-inch male child from 
a heap of loose sod under an alien 
bush. Needle aspiration provided a 
sample that carbon-fourteened 
around 183, plus or minus 3.2 years. 
Deep in the woods he found the 
third body — a perfectly preserved 
body of a women in her early thir- 



ties, intact down to the eyelashes 
and earrings biuried under ten inches 
of damp, musty, alien humus. It 
carbon-fourteened at 191 plus or 
minus 3.2 years. 

Two hundred years dead I She 
looked like she could have died yes- 
terday. Bob released the controls 
and slowly sat back in the booth. 

Why would bodies be better pre- 
served away from the center of 
town? He had expected just the op- 
posite. Crumbling bones fit better 
with forest humus. Mummification 
can occur occasionally in human 
dwellings, where conditions are bet- 
ter for drying in the absence of a 
lot of micro-organisms. But he had 
no explanation for the girPs body. 
The only time he had ever heard of 
bodies that old being that well pre- 
served was in a Temple of Embalm- 
ing display. Of course they used 
techniques like irradiation-steriliza- 
tion, quick freeze and sealing with 
inert gases. None of those things 
seemed to apply here. Certainly not 
sterility I He leaned back into the 
binoc-rest and set for phase micro- 
scopy. 

Using the micromanips he care- 
fully teased out the granular and 
cellulose debris of the humus and 
quickly confirmed the presence of 
the full spectrum of alien micro- 
phylla: crawling mites, lashing nem- 
atodes, swimming protozoa and the 
random Brownian dance of myce- 
lium and bacterial clumps. As he 
worked he ruminated half to himself 



108 



IF 




and half for the benefit of the ever- 
present auditory pick-ups. 

Olga watched his thoughtful 
frown for seven minutes and then 
activated her humorist circuit, pos- 
tulating. ^Terhaps the well preserv- 
ed Earth artifacts and bodies are 
the planet’s way of saying the ecol- 
ogy is friendly towards the things of 
Earth.” 

He glanced up, the frown un- 
changed. 

'^It is the spirit of the planet try- 
ing to communicate,” offered Olga. 
But her joke was losing its sponta- 
neity. 

Finally he relaxed and smiled. As- 
suming a metallic monotone, he 
said; "illogical.” 

T^or several days Ralph had been 
^ wallowing at the same point in 
the stream, his path block^ by a 
weir of brittle, moss-covered drift- 
wood. Like an engorged black tick 
he struggled weakly on the slippery 
mud bank, first down to a stagnant 
pool for a drink and then up to the 
hanging sod for a mouthful of vege- 
tation. Whenever a crawling or hop- 
ping creature crossed his path he 
tried to crush it and add the non- 
descript mass to his diet. In spite 
of the cramping diarrhea and foul 
crusts on his teeth and tongue he 
smiled. His eyes were glazed over. 
In his mind he relived his happy 
childhood. 

This monotonous activity was in- 
terrupted by the appearance of a 



pack of carnivorous water manunal- 
oids — a two-poimd alien wat^r rat 
that traveled in hxmting packs. He 
had seen optic playbacks of these 
creatures stripping the carcass of a 
herbivore, and the sight of them 
cleared his mind and sent him flop- 
ping up the bank into the brush. 
They quickly swarmed over him. 

/Riga’s panel went from green to 
amber-one. It was in the en- 
zyme section of Organics. Bob was 
there listening to the tech in sub- 
strates. 

"It’s the amylase, sir. I was 
checking these strains of alien bac- 
teria against our starch standard 
with no results. But when I substi- 
tute alien starch I get a varied pro- 
file of amylase activity — much as 
I’d expect from a panel of Earth 
organisms . except they only di- 
gest starch from this planet.” He 
held up the graphic printout. 

Bob took the strip and studied 
the figures. It was one of the stan- 
dard forms that M5.U. VII had 
been using as it isolated and sub- 
cultured the soil bacteria of one of 
the more fertile-looking valleys. It 
had been classifying the flora using 
the Earth-type criteria (where ap- 
plicable). -Although M.S.U. VII 
was one of the microbiology robots, 
it often found itself helping with 
projects started by the biochemical 
M.S.U.^s. Substrates was a good 
place to identify organic molecules. 

Bob asked: "How many of these 



STAR ITCH 



109 




en2yme*substrate incompatabilities 
have you found?” 

"This is the first: starch. Up to 
now we’ve been working on the sim- 
pler molecules: mea, sugars, fatty 
acids and some amino adds. This is 
the first time we noticed any dif- 
ference between earth and alien sub- 
strates.” 

"Have you tried the alien sub- 
strates against a panel of earth or- 
ganisms yet?” 

"No, sir. But the M.S.U. does 
have several earth panels. We’ll im- 
suspend them and start them in 
continuous culture. I shoidd start 
getting those results in about twelve 
hours,” said the tech. 

"Earth organisms against the 
alien substrates . right?” 

"Right, sir.” 

"Good. I’ll check back with you 
later,” said Bob as he left the con- 
trol room in the Organics section. As 
he floated down the hall he glanced 
up into one of Olga’s consoles and 
said: "You know ... I think it is 
time I went down myself. It would 
be much more effident if I was 
right there working with those 
M.S.U.’s instead of trying to super- 
vise them from orbit.” 

He paused, measuring his words 
carefully; "We may be relying too 
much on the judgment of those ro- 
bots. I just don’t have too much 
faith in a dass eight when it is 
working alone.” 

Olga asked: "Are you volunteer- 
ing?” 



"Yes, I am.” 

C t'^hat may be a one-way trip,” 
-I she reminded him. "You 
know that I will not use energy to 
return an expendable to orbit until 
after the Implanting Down is a suc- 
cess. If I would be forced to ©ve 
up on this planet, I’d have to leave 
you here while I carried my remmn- 
ing seven Implants to a friendlier 
starsystem.” 

He masked his irritation. "I un- 
derstand the priority. Implant first, 
and all that. But I’d prefer to be 
down on the surface. My X-ray 
densogram shows an eighteen per 
cent skeletal demineralization, and 
it is progressing in spite of my work 
with the gym. If I don’t return to a 
normal gravity soon, my bones will 
be nothing but papier-mache. 

"Besides, you have the tropical 
Implant to consider. If is already 
down. The sooner we get an under- 
standing of this planet’s hazards the 
safer it will be,” he sjdd. 

Olga was not surprised at his lack 
of emotional overlay when weighing 
dangers to himself. He had faced 
death frequently when he was in 
competition for The Games. He had 
actually been killed several times. 
When the resuscitator team re- 
sponded to his telemetered cardiac 
arrest they were likely to find his 
anoxic body giving his assassin a 
parting kick. 

The resulting glial scars calloused 
both his cerebral cortex and his 



no 



IF 




psyche, enabling him to ignore most 
of life’s minor traumas. 

The reasons he gave for going 
down wouldn’t be the whole truth, 
she calculated. Entering the alien 
biosphere was probably just his way 
of meeting the enemy on his own 
ground — the better to grapple 
with it. His decision to go himself 
was encouraging to Olga and Cigar, 
for it reflected his subconscious con- 
fidence. He must have felt that 
chances were better than average 
that he would survive and succeed. 
Computers had learned early in the 
game to respect the intuition of the 
more intricate organic brains. 

Olga assented. ''You spend the 
next eighteen hours eating, sleeping 
and working in the gym. I’ll assem- 
ble a mobile lab and rewarm a team 
of expendable parameds to accom- 
pany you. Orbiting Down time will 
be in seventy-two hours.” Then she 
added in her usual feminine voice: 
"Okay?” 

"Okayl” He went to gather his 
notes. 

. ^becking with Substrates the next 
^ day he confirmed his suspi- 
cions. The panel of earth organisms 
were having trouble with the alien 
substrates. Starch was the first to 
show up, but he was sure there 
would be others. Without starch 
you might have a pretty thin popu- 
lation, but not a hundred per cent 
dead population. The simple mole- 
cules cross-digested well: glucose, 



fructose and other sugars; organic 
acids, aldehydes, ketone bodies and 
smaller dextrins. 

"Check back with me if you rim 
into any more nondigestables,” he 
said, regretting the time delays in 
isolating the compounds prior to 
testing. It would be weeks before 
they really got into the complex 
groups of amino acids, proteins and 
fats, but he was sure that was where 
the real trouble was. 

The second yellow light — an 
amber-three — came on in the O.S. 
M. Control section where the moni- 
tors were picking up the optic rec- 
ord of one of the lost scouts. 

It was Ralph Eggers — black, 
bloated and demented — wandering 
around his camp with a blank ex- 
pression on his face. Nothing the 
O.S.M. could do would impress him, 
and there were no mobile units clos- 
er than the ghost town. That one 
was dispatched to go render aid. 

"My God I” exploded Bob. "That 
can’t be Ralph Eggers I” For a mo- 
ment he watched, estimating height 
and relative bone size. The soft tis- 
sues hardly resembled anything hu- 
man, but when the vacant smile ex- 
posed a gold half-crown Bob recog- 
nized his friend, and a reflex hatred 
for the planet grew inside him. 

Ralph had probably been the 
most sensitive and idealistic of all 
the scouts, thought Bob. And this 
warped planet had singled him out 
and transformed him to that horror 
on the screen.

she sat there husking and shelling. 
They ate corn bread and sipped 
water in their little house in the 
corn shock. He said all the things he 
had saved up through the years, 
and in the days to come she bathed 
his wounds. He sunned himself and 
his strength returned. Life was good, 
and in time they made love. He was 
happy. He watched her abdomen 
grow with their child. They took 
frequent walks . together. 

T>ob’s skimmer moved across the 
^ tidal flats with Peter, a para- 
med, at the controls. 

"How do you s^pose we missed 
Ralph? I’d think that either the 
MJS.U. or our sensors would have 
picked him up. He couldn’t have 
come this far,” said Peter. 

Bob studied the infrared maps of 
the area, taken from orbit. "He is 
either dead or he’s dug himself a 
hole and crawled in. The sensors are 
calibrated to pick up any warm- 
blooded animal over tWrty kilogram 
mass. There is nothing here.” 

"Couldn’t we make a couple more 
runs through the area? He may be 
in one of those gullies. The area is 
pretty densely overgrown.” 

Bob watched silted pools pass un- 
der the skimmer before answering: 
"We’ll make a couple more passes 
. hoping he’ll come out from 
wherever he’s hiding ... if he is still 
alive. But there are several other 
missing scouts that we’ll be hunting 
for too.” 



Their search was cut off by the 
report of a body. It answered the 
description of Ralph and it was fur- 
ther down the tidal flats. The M.S. 
U. that made the discovery was 
standing b3^ and sending a homing 
beam. It only took them a bit over 
two hours to get there. 

The body, what was left of it, 
lay on a makeshift raft on the edge 
of a larger salt water pool. Water 
action and sharp coral had removed 
most of the skin and subcutaneous 
fat, but there was no sign of putre- 
faction or anthropophagy. 

"Carbon fourteen?” asked Bob. 

"Less than half a year,” the M. 
S.U. answered. 

"Probably one of our people 
then,” said Bob. He retract^ the 
lower lip. The gold crown was not 
there. It wasn’t Ralph. 

He autopsied it ri^t on the spot 
...feeding samples to the M.S.U. 
for tox and micro. The only gross 
finding which puzzled him was the 
heavy, waxy appearance of the 
brain. On cut surface it was much 
firmer and more translucent than 
normal. The other findings he ex- 
pected: a universal black pigmenta- 
tion of all tissues, abundant edema 
fluids, absence of all body fat, atro- 
phy of muscles, cirrhosis of the liver 
and — of course — the skin ulcers. 

Microscopies a few minutes later 
confirmed the above and added beri- 
beri changes in the peripheral nerves 
and myocardium. The waxy brain 
micros just showed holes in the cells. 



STAR ITCH 



113 




Tox might tell what was in those 
boles. Similar holes were also pres- 
ent in the cells of the liver, spleen 
and l3nnph nodes — but less mark- 
ed than the central nervous system. 

Bob put a few samples in a hold 
jar” and had the rest of the remains 
buried. They moved on while the 
M.S.U. continued its analysis of the 
waxy material. 

As they traveled to the search 
area for the next lost scout Bob 
asked: "Olga. Was there anything 
unusual about those scouts that dis- 
appeared? I mean, when compared 
to the ones who are still at their 
camps?” 

"We already went over their 
backgrounds: genetic, skill and psy- 
chic. If anything, they were the best 
conditioned and the most content 
with their assignments.” 

"How do you mean, best condi- 
tioned?” he asked. 

"Well, they seemed to enjoy their 
work more. They cultivated larger 
gardens, did more landscaping, ex- 
plored larger areas more thoroughly, 
and in their free time they hiked, 
hunted or fished,” she answered. 
"In fact, that is one of the reasons 
why it is difficult to pinpoint their 
disappearances. They were usually 
away from the O.S.M. most of the 
time.” 

He turned to Peter. "That fits 
perfectly. If your diet lacks some- 
thing you just accentuate it with 
exertion. You burn up whatever 



supply your body cells may have 
stored and the deficiency shows up 
sooner.” 

"What deficiency, sir?” asked 
Peter. 

"I don’t know for sure, just yet, 
but it looks like a mixed one: pro- 
tein, calories and some vitamins. 
Those scouts on long hunting trips 
were probably away from their 
earth food supply and were eating 
more of this dien muck.” 

Finally Tox came up with the 
cause of death in the autopsied 
scout: a storage disease. An inert 
galactoside containing an unrecog- 
nizable amino acid was stored in 
massive amounts in the brain, liver, 
spleen and other lymphoid tissues. 
The M.S.U. relay^ the molecular 
characteristics up to Olga for fur- 
ther ident. 

The black pigment was homogen- 
tistic acid: a fairly harmless by- 
product of faulty metabolism of the 
amino acids t3^osine and phenyla- 
lanine, also called ochronosis. The 
black pigmentation usually caused 
no serious ill effects other than ar- 
thritis. 

Bob was familiar with these le- 
sions, often seeing them in study 
sets and occasionally in the clinics. 
But always they had been in sepa- 
rate patients. They had different 
etiologies. Storage diseases were 
sort of genetic defects: you lacked 
a particular enzyme and suffered 
from a storage of the molecule that 
enzyme is supposed to handle. De- 



114 



IP 




fidency states were acquired natu- 
rally, Your diet just lacked some vi- 
tal molecule — a ''vitamin.” 

Olga identified the autopsy galac- 
toside as neuraminic acid, similar to 
the molecule stored in Tay-Sach’s 
disease. 

"Adult Tay-Sach’s disease I I’ve 
never heard of that before.” 

"It has never been reported,” 
said Olga after reviewing her mem- 
ory banks. 

The main feature of that disease 
was the mental deterioration. Hav- 
ing seen the micros on the brain, he 
could understand why. 

T Te checked with the tech in sub- 
strates to see how the earth- 
alien cross checking was coming. So 
far there were only a few nondigest- 
ables — all in the larger molecules, 
usually ones with benzene rings. The 
most resistant forms outside of the 
starch molecule were the two "es- 
sential” amino adds, t)n:osine and 
phenylalanine, which explained the 
early appearance of black ochron- 
osis in the scouts. .It wasn’t their 
faulty enzymes: just resistant sub- 
strates. 

The tech explained about enzyme 
spedfidty. Both the enzyme and its 
subtrate are three-dimensional mol- 
ecules that have to fit together like 
a hand in a glove before they can 
react. On Earth organic evolution 
was a progression in complexity so 
that molecules came before cell, and 
cell before higher fornis. Genes con- 



trol heredity, so a molecule — say 
tyrosine — is made the same all 
over the planet; and its enzyme — 
t3nrosinase — is the same. This al- 
lows complete energy cydes. The 
tyrosine molecule can be passed 
from the eaten to the eater. 

However, on this alien planet evo- 
lution was parallel but not identi- 
cal. The molecules served the same 
function but were slightly different 
in rotation of a part or configura- 
tion. But it still worked. They were 
all like that, with matching genes 
and enzymes. It was only when you 
took the enzymes from earth and 
tried to digest alien molecules that 
the difference showed up. It was 
like trying to put your left hand in 
your right glove. The configurations 
didn’t match. 

As Bob listened his sullen hatred 
of the planet grew. The planet’s 
friendly facade covered a deadly 
molecular biosphere. He loathed the 
cruel manner in which it killed its 
victims — robbing them of their 
minds and then letting them blun- 
der around tearing off bits of flesh 
on inanimate barbs and spurs. 

With the cause of the problem 
pretty well defined, Olga put the 
Separate Ecology Rule into effect, 
and the Implant went on modified 
greenhouse status. Earth plants 
grew in soil seeded by earth organ- 
isms and fertilized by earth com- 
post. The animals and humans ate 
only earth foodstuffs. Large com- 
post piles seeded with mixed earth/

aKen flora managed to decompose 
debris from either source when the 
flora was properly mixed. Most of 
the smaller molecules could be cross- 
digested. Further work in substrates 
showed that malting alien grain re- 
sulted in a wort of small sugars 
which could also be cross-digested 
by organisms from either source. 
(In malting, the grain’s own cellu- 
lar enzymes are activated by germi- 
nation, and they digest the seed’s 
own large molecules down to small- 
er ones.) 

Man was at last in the Procyon 
system to stay.

Oeveral of the scouts were found in 
^ various stages of the alien-mole- 
cule disease while still alive. It was 
learned that the condition was some- 
what reversible, with a simple earth 
diet. 

Of course, brain cells that were 
lost could not be replaced, but by 
supplying the needed amino acids 
and vitamins the body quickly re- 
covered. The mental picture usu- 
ally improved partially, leaving 
some retardation, memory and I.Q. 
losses. 

Cigar was now re-outfitted. He 
was humming what would be a hap- 
py tune as he recorded the regrowth 
of earth plants in the bare patches 
that marked his old fields and gar- 
d«is of Implant One. By inoculat- 
ing earth flora, the peatlike layers of 



two-hundred-year-old cellulose fi- 
bers began to rot, providing a rich 
humus for cultivating earth crops. 

'^he M.S.U. crossed the peat 
^ patch, tilling and inoculating. 
Her fleeing form attracted its optic 
pickups. "A thirty-kilogram homi- 
noid,” it registered and loaded up 
a tranquilizer dart to catch it for 
dissection. Zoological banks opened 
up and the optic record was relay- 
ed to Olga. 

The picture was projected back 
down to Bob’s screen in the skim- 
mer. '^Good God! She’s human I 
That’s either a pygmy or a runt. Ol- 
ga, stop that class eight M.S.U. be- 
fore it hurts her I” 

”Too late. The dart has been 
fired and a local ion storm has cut 
off communication. Can you get 
over there in the skimmer?” said 
Olga. 

"Damn class eights 1” muttered 
Bob as he lifted off and started 
tracking after the M.S.U. It was an 
hour and a half before they reached 
the dull-witted three-ton robot. It 
had sealed up in its heat-shield like 
a turtle, and there was a seventy- 
three-inch black hominoid pounding 
on its sides with a stout limb. 

"Whoa there, big fellow,” said 
Bob, approaching in a crouch. "Give 
me the club before — ” 

He was interrupted by a wild 
club-swinging attack. Bob reflex- 
ively went into a shiko-dachi dance 
and gracefully disarmed his attack-

er, gently laying the bigger man out 
on the peat. Two parameds arrived 
quickly to restrain him without 
hurting him. 

It was Ralph. He didn’t talk, and 
he didn’t seem to know or under- 
stand them. 

Bob half dreaded that he’d find 
the dissected body of the small fe- 
male someplace. Then the M.S.U. 
lifted its re-entry heat shield, and 
there she was. A beautifully form- 
ed little human female, sleeping in 
the manipulators (arms) of the ro- 
bot. She looked to be about fifty- 
four inches tall, about twenty-eight 
kilograms in weight. No mutation, 
just a runt. 

'^Okay, soil-tiller, why are you 
holding the human? Why didn’t you 
let her go?” 

The optic pickups focused on him, 
and the lingual read-out activated: 
'^Hominoid . correction . hu- 
man had been drugged prior to ar- 
rival of large male. While asleep 
she required supervision for life- 
support. I could not release her to 
an obviously demented individual, 
or she might have aspirated or as- 
phyxiated. I had to wait until the 
drug wore off before releasing her.” 

^'Well, we’re not demented. Re- 
lease her to us.” 

Two of the parameds climbed up 
on the treads of the giant cultivator 
robot, but it took only one to carry 
the small female. They wrapped her 
in a blanket and stretched her out 
on the skimmer seat. 



By the way, what stopped you 
from completing your studies of her 
— the dissection?” asked Bob as hei 
started helping Ralph up, still re- 
strained by the parameds. 

The robot answered: ''The large 
male attacked me. I recognized him 
as a human and assumed that she 
was one also.” 

"Good work, class eight,” said 
Bob sarcastically. 

"Class seven,” corrected the ma- 
chine. 

A s she woke up Bob could uhder- 
stand how the M.S.U. could 
mistake her for an animal. Her coal- 
black sclerae gave her eyes the sol- 
id black look of the mollusk eye, 
her hair — a long heavy mane — 
covered her from head to mid-thigh, 
and her reflex time — about a third 
again faster than his — gave her 
a wild, jumpy appearance. They 
carefully released both of them. 

Without a word, they ran off to- 
gether into the brush. 

It was then that they noticed the 
edge of the field was rimmed by a 
narrow zone of dense corn stalks. 
Like a palisade the crowded stalks 
formed a fence about a meter thick. 
Inside, the entire field was the usu- 
al bare, flat peat and outside was 
the press of alien vegetation. For 
some reason that wall of corn had 
been growing there on the edge of 
the field, slowly pressing into the 
surroundings and building up the 
central peat pack, which now layer- 



STAR ITCH

ed some three feet above ground 

levd. 

Standing at the edge and looking 
down, Bob saw the thick mat-like 
growth centrally and the sparse new 
growth in the outer zone of the 
corn-rim. 

"Ill bet this field has been grow- 
ing here since the first Implant/’ 
ventured Bob. ''There must be ten 
acres of peat here — three or four 
feet thick — and each cellulose fi- 
ber laid down by that expanding 
rim of corn.” 

One of the parameds picked up a 
sample of the peat and placed it in 
a specimen container. The M.S.U. 
was busy plowing at the other end 
of the field. 

The paramed observed: "I’d 

guess the soil ecology of this field 
lacks the cellulose-eaters. Earth ter- 
mites is all it probably needs. Then 
you’d have that corn all over this 
bare spot.” 

"I think the cultivator is taking 
care of that now,” said Bob. "Let’s 
not excite Ralph and his little 
friend. They’ve gotten along with- 
out us this long. A few more days 
won’t hurt anything.” 

^^hey planted a sensory probe on 
the edge of the corn patch and 
stocked the area with a small flock 
of chickens to supplement the pig- 
mented hominoids’ diet. With the 
probe they learned that the pygmy 
colony numbered twenty-three: five 
paired adults, eight young adults 



and five small children. Ralidi was 
counted as one of the adults and 
the female was his mate. They had 
one child. 

Studying the group, they learned 
that there was no Iwguage other 
than a dozen or so grunts, squeals 
and gestures. No artifacts other 
than a few sun-dried clay bowls and 
random sticks. Diet: corn — green 
and dry, whole, crushed and soaked. 
They had had fire on occasions in 
the past, but none now: nor could 
they guess how they got the fire. 
Their custom of disposing of waste 
material (body and other) by going 
"three paces into the bush” prob- 
ably explained how the rim of corn 
expanded — following the growing 
zone of Earth flora. 

'^he patch nurse sat down at her 
desk and looked at the report. 
The third Eggers’ child was ready 
to graduate from the patch school 
and go to her new foster home at 
the local base. Three younger sib- 
lings were already crowding her out 
of the little hut. The screen lit up 
and Bob’s lined face appeared. 

"Cathy Eggers ready to be picked 
up?” he asked. 

"Yes,” answered the nurse. Ralph 
and Betty both sat in on kinder- 
garten class today, and she had dis- 
cussed Cathy’s leaving with them. 
They seemed to understand — al- 
though with a vocabulary of about 
seventy words it was difficult to 
know how much they took in. 



118 



IF 




Ralph Junior and I will drop by 
around supper time and pick her up 
then. See you.” The screen blanked. 
Ralph Jxmior was Ralph’s eldest. 

Bob made a point of checking on 
Ralph — although there now was 
little hope that he would ever get 
back any of his adult memories. In 
spite of Bob’s efforts at injecting a 
purified alien enzyme (galactosi- 
dase) into Ralph’s system to speed 
up the removal of the stored mole- 
cules, the permanently damaged 
brain cells would never come back. 
Now he seemed to be retraining un- 
damaged, but previously unused, 
portions of his brain. 

On the improved Earth diet the 
patch pygmies showed some ability 
at using tools and picking up simple 
speech. Their children, on the other 
hand, would be perfectly normal. 
Since they would be protected from 
the alien amino acids there was no 
damage by phenyl-ketonuria; so, 
unlike their parents, the patch chil- 
dren could grasp the cultural level 
of Implant Two. These children left 
home to grow up with Implant Two 
and contribute their genetic mater- 
ial to the growing human popula- 
tion. 

Tt was autumn. A raging forest fire 
was blackening the foothills on 
an island in the temperate zone. 
Bob Zuliani switched off his laser 
and watched the flames from his 
hovercraft. 



He had been careful to start the . 
fire along the entire circumference 
of the coastline so that it would 
burn toward the center — hopefully 
sterilizing the island of its alien ecr , 
ology. He enjoyed the island-sterili- 
zation project. This would be num- 
ber sixty-four for him. Tomorrow 
the cultivator M.S.U.’s would begin 
plowing and inoculating, and by 
spring a little colony of humans 
should be farming the land. 

There were thousands of suitable 
islands in the achipelago, easy to 
sterilize with their technology — 
and fertile when claimed. Yes, he 
was planting humans all over the 
planet. 

^igar’s questioning circuits had 
^ stopped nagging him when the 
nondigestibles were found. The mys- 
tery was solved. Now survivors of 
his own Implant were actually alive 
and contributing to the genetic pool 
on the surface. 

His components were being up- 
dated, and he was now equipp^ 
with an M.S.U. of his own. He even 
had his memory banks brought up 
to date by Olga. 

Orbiting around in a repolished 
hull, he was looking forward to the 
day when he would take an Implant 
from this planet to seed another star 
system. After all, he reasoned, a 
starship doesn’t retire after just one 
successful Implant!

IP ♦ Short Story 




There*s nothing fike a dollop of LA. 
to make the world go round or zigzag! 



TTj^eigand Dennis was seeking 
^ ^ moment of refuge in his wef 



a 

refuge in his west 
wing of the White House office. The 
press secretary, special assistant and 
brains behind ^e "throne of the 
President of the United States of 
the Americas, had just come from 
a meeting of the President with 
his latest think tank. 

So far as Dennis was concerned, 
the think tank had thought itself 
dry; either that, or it had sprung 
a leak. 

The latest brain storm had come 
a cropper. It had seemed a prom- 
ising enough idea, once the scien- 



tist cloddies had finally succeeded 
in teaching the porpoises to talk, to 
give them jobs herding great num- 
bers of whales, something like cow- 
boys herding beef cattle. It looked 
to be a solution of the protein 
shortage throughout the world. But 
who could have foreseen that they 
would first demand wages, and then, 
when these weren’t foreseen that 
those damned Marx-spouting, com- 
munist-trained dolphins would infil- 
trate them, with the present danger 
of the herds of whales being ex- 
propriated? 

Steve Hammond, the Secret Serv- 



120 




ice agent assigned to Weigand Den- 
nis, stuck his head in the office 
door and said, ''Mr. Dennis, there’s 
an inventor out here who wants to 
see the President.” 

"Inventor? Send him over to the 
National Science Foundation; they 
have a special Department of 
Crackpots, or whatever they call it, 
for inventors.” 

"Yes, sir. But they sent him over 
here.” 

"Well, why?” 

"It seems there’s a standing or- 
der that anyone who comes up with 
an idea that might end the depres- 
sion is to be referred to the \^ite 
House staff.” 

Dennis groaned. "All right, damn 
it, send him in. But listen ...” 

"Yes, sir?” 

"You stand right outside that 
door, just in case. The way things 
have been going today, it’s as sure 
as death, taxes and our losing the 
next election that he’s a nut.” 

"Yes, sir.” Steve Hammond’s 
head disappeared again. 

^T^he inventor’s name turned out to 
be Newton Brown, and he 
weighed approximately one hundred 
pounds and sported a beard that 
looked as though moths not only 
bedded down there but held orgies. 
The facial expression was that of a 
lost pup, a very lost pup. 

Weigand Dennis said, "Sit down, 
Mr. Brown.” 

The other perched on the edge of 



a straight chair and bobbed his 
Adam’s apple. "My friends call me 
Newt.” 

Dennis considered that for a mo- 
ment. He could have said, "I’ll bet 
they do,” but refrained. Instead, 
he waited for more. 

Newt Brown cleared his throat 
and said, "I came to you first.”" 
When there was no immediate re- 
sponse to that he said, "My latest 
research. I’ve finally found a use 
for water. It’s obviously a flop as a 
beverage.” 

"Oh, great. What’s that got to 
do with the President?” 

"It will solve all the problems 
that beset the world, Mr. Dennis.’* 

"Your new invention? What are 
you going to do?” Dennis said sar- 
castically. "Blow it up?” 

"Oh no, not at all. Just the oppo- 
site.” 

Weigand Dennis said cautiously, 
"What’s the opposite of blowing up 
the world?” 

Newton Brown was obviously 
launching into his fling now. "Mr. 
Dennis, what this world needs is 
love. Every great thinker in the his- 
tory of the world has advocated 
love. Love thy neighbor as thyself 
was taught long, long before Jesus.” 

"All right, all right,” Dennis said. 
"Every religious leader, every phil- 
osopher down through the centuries, 
has advocated that we love one an- 
other. Man seems to accept the 
teaching in principle, but when he 
gets around to dealing with his fel-

low man, he usually winds up clob- 
bering him instead.” 

Newt Brown beamed, as though 
at a receptive student. Right,” he 
said. 

Weigand Dennis looked at him. 
"So what are you going to do with 
water to change all that?” 

"Oh, it’s not primarily water. 
That’s just my method of distribu- 
tion.” 

"Of what?” 

"L.A.” 



Tl^eigand looked at the other for 
^ ^ a long moment, wondering if 
he really wanted to continue this 
conversation. 

Finally, he said, "Los Angeles is 
already distributed all over hell’s 
half acre. It stretches from San 
Francisco to San Diego.” 

"Not Los Angeles. L.A. My new 
hallucinogen, Love Acid.” he hur- 
ried on. "We’ll dump it in the res- 
ervoirs.” 

"Now wait a minute. A new hal- 
lucinogen. What’s wrong with LSD? 
Didn’t we have enough trouble with 
the old ones?” 

Newt Brown made a scoffing ges- 
ture. "LSD, mescaline, psilocybin. 
Old hat. I mean they’re antiquated. 
Nothing. Love Acid is the ultimate 
hallucinogen. It will solve all the 
world’s problems. No more wars. 
No more economic crises. No more 
depressions. Everybody will love ev- 
erybody.^* 

In spite of his caution, Weigand 



Dennis was becoming intrigued. 
"How would it end depressions?” 

"What causes depressions? The 
flow of industry ends. When the 
owner of an industry cannot make 
a profit, he closes it down, not car- 
ing that there might be thousands 
of customers, consumers who need 
the product he manufacturers. He 
doesn’t care. All he’s interested in is 
making a profit. Now if he loved 
everybody, he wouldn’t give a hoot 
about profit. He’d just want to sup- 
ply his product to those who need- 
ed it.” 

Weigand Dennis left off consider- 
ation of some of the socio-economic 
ramifications of that for later. 

He said, "Now if I get this right, 
what you want to do is dump this 
new hallucinogen of yours in the 
drinking water of the^ whole coun- 
try.” 

"Correct.” 

"And then everybody would love 
everybody else.” 

"That is correct.” Newt Brown 
beamed once again as though at 
a student who had just mastered 
a difficult teaching. 

"Holy smokes.” 

"Obviously.” 

"Then, I suppose, after you’ve 
dosed everybody in the United 
States of the Americas, you’d turn 
it over to Common Eur-Asia and 
. and everybody.” 

'^Tewt Brown nodded emphatical- 
^ ^ ly. " Absolutely. If they refuse

the gift, we’ll lob it over into their 
reservoirs by rocket missile. Use 
up our stockpile of missiles. We 
won’t want nuclear missiles by that 
time, anyway; we’ll love everybody, 
not want to kill them.” 

^'Holy smokes.” Weigand Dennis 
shook his head, momentarily over- 
whelmed. Something came to him, 
and he narrowed his eyes at the 
other. ”How do I know it works?” 
”Oh, it works all right, all right. 
I’ve tried it out on all sorts that 
supposedly hate each other. On cats 
and dogs, on cobras and mongooses, 
on ferrets and rats. It can get a bit, 
ah, gruesome, watching its effects 
on some of these. Oh, it works all 
right.” 

”You mean it works on 
^'I told you. It’s imi versa!. It 
works on everything. Of course, 
that’s one aspect. We’d all wind up 
vegetarians.” 

Dennis grunted. We’ll all wind 
up that way, anyway. Who can af- 
ford meat any more? But, look, you 
mean I could give a dollop of this 
stuff to my worst enemy and then 
he’d love me?” 

Newt Brown squirmed a bit, in 
discomfort. '^Well, admittedly that, 
along with the vegetarian necessity, 
is the big shortcoming.” 

Weigand Dennis looked at him. 
Newt Brown twisted in his chair 
unhappily. He said, assume your 
worst enemy is a man?” 

That didn’t quite come through. 
*^Of course.” 



Newt Brown said grudgingly, 
”Then, yes. I’m afraid so.” 

^'You’re afraid what?” 

^'He’d want to love you.” 

A suspicion was beginning to 
dawn in Weigand Dennis. 'Took 
here,” he growled. "When you say 
that everybody would love every- 
body after taking this L.A. of yours, 
how do you mean?” 

"Love, love,” Newt Brown said 
impatiently. "You know what love 
is.” 

"There is love and love,” Wei- 
gand Dennis said dangerously. "I 
love the President’s private secre- 
tary. I also love my cotmtry and 
chocolate cake with vanilla ice 
cream. I also love a parade ...” 
His voice was beginning to go slight- 
ly higher. "... but I’ve never 
wanted to go to bed with one!” 
Newt Brown bobbed his Adam’s 
apple. "This is the kind of love you 
undoubtedly feel for the Presi- 
dent’s secretary.” 

Weigand stared at him. "You 
mean this L.A. of yours that you 
want to slip into the nation’s drink- 
ing water is a universal aphrodis- 
iac?” 

"You might put it that way. I 
prefer to think ...” 

"And this Mickey Finn to end 
all Mickey Finns would give every- 
body ...” 

"Everything, not just every- 
body,” Newt Brown interjected. 

"... the hots for everybody 
else?”

The self-proclaimed inventor 
summoned his dignity. "'That is not 
the way I would explain it.” 

■V^eigand Dennis yelled, "Ham- 
mondl” 

Steve Hammond burst into the 
office, .38 Magnum Recoilless at 
the ready. Newt Brown winced. 

^^Yes, sir,” the Secret Service 
bodyguard snapped. 

^^Do they still have chains?” 

Steve Hammond blinked at him. 
” Chains, Mr. Dennis?” 

^'In the old days, the king, or 
whoever, would yell. Throw him in 
chains r 

Squealing terror. Newt Brown 
tried to scurry toward the door, but 
Steve Hammond had him in an arm 
lock. 

Holding the still mewling inven- 
tor with one hand, he turned back 
to Weigand Dennis. '^Well, no sir, 
I don’t think so. All we’ve got now 
is handcuffs and leg irons.” 

^^Okay. Get him into handcuffs 
and leg irons and into some top se- 
curity cell. And listen, Hammond, 
if he’s got any vials of fluid, any 
packets of powders, or any pills 
on him, flush them all down the 
drain. No, wait a minute. The rats 
in the sewers might get it, or the 
fish in the sea. I’d hate to have 
several million passionate rats run- 



ning around the streets trying to* 
love us, or have fish storming the 
beaches with a love-light in their 
eye. Burn it all.” 

”Yes, sir.” Steve Hamnwnd 
thought about it for a moment. 

What’s the charge?” 

'Tharge?” 

The Secret Service man was 
apologetic. ^^Well, yes sir. There 
ought to be some charge.” He add- 
ed, ''Don’t you think?” 

That set Weigand Dennis back 
only momentarily. He turned to 
Newton Brown. ^Tisten, did you 
take any of this L.A. of yours your- 
self?” 

Newt Brown was indignant. '^Of 
tourse. I wouldn’t subject another 
to an experiment I wasn’t willing to 
try on myself ...” 

Weigand looked at Steve Ham- 
mond. "Book him on a morals 
charge.” 

The bodyguard looked at him 
blankly. "Do we have evidence to 
back it?” 

Weigand said, "Look. Just throw 
him into any prison available. By 
the time his case comes to trial, we’ll 
have plenty of witnesses ranging 
from nurses in the prison hospital, to 
prison matrons, to prison warders, 
to fellow prisoners. Let’s hope they 
don’t have a dog for a prison mas- 
cot. Haul him away!” END

Everyone wanted to steal the Pheasant

bumping, rocking, now and then Theft. 



125 





The most startling, galaxy-shak- 
ing theft ever recorded in the annals 
of crime, which, generally speaking, 
were annals fraught with startling, 
galaxy-shaking thefts. Even to reach 
the pheasant would be a chore for 
any world’s army. It’s “cage” was 
a giant, bullet-proof, shatter-proof, 
melt-proof, unbreakable, uncrack- 
able, unchoppable glass dome buried 
beneath layers of concrete and steel 
seven miles beneath the off-limits 
grounds of the Actria Global Game 
Reserves, a dome boasting, aside 
from the formidable security arrange- 
ments, every comfort a pheasant 
could expect from life. 

The air taxi banked to the left, 
slipping down through the last two 
hundred feet toward the plaza in front 
of the United Worlds Relief Funds 
Building. Sloane mused that the 
building was much more than the 
name implied. The twenty stories 
above ground were the quarters from 
which UW officials processed re- 
quests for and dispatched emergency 
monies to help worlds ravaged by 
floods, storms, meteor strikes, and 
every and all catastrophies which 
could and regularly did strike the 
three hundred and seventy-two mem- 
ber planets of the United Worlds 
Federation. There was a basement 
where IBM cards were stored, re- 
ports were filed, and janitorial sup- 
plies were kept. Then, deep beneath 
the street, the other fifty-eight floors 
and their employees functioned. The 
building was constructed like an ice- 
berg, with the greatest bulk unseen. 
In those fifty-eight levels below the 
water line. United World Police 
functioned. 



It wasn’t a secret to the proverbial 
big shots: the business leaders, the 
law makers, or the diplomats. They 
realized that without a forceful polic- 
ing group, the Federation would fold 
just as the ancient United Nations 
had. But the men-on-the-street, or at 
least a majority of them, would think 
of it as a form of storm trooperism 
or secret police. 

Therefore, to avoid public debate 
and minority protest, it was kept 
secret. 

The craft sputtered, glided to the 
cement, and settled finally with a 
solid thump. The price of the fare 
popped up in lighted numerals above 
the dashboard: 34.6 c. He paid it 
through the slot in the back of the 
front seat and waited for the ma- 
chine to run a counterfeit check. Sat- 
isfied, the taxi said “Thank you” and 
flung open its doors. Looking down 
at the flagstone and cement as he got 
out, he thought about Talman waiting 
a mile below . 

44XTour appointment was ten min- 
jL utes ago, Mr. Sloane,” Tal- 
man said, resting his large, muscular, 
big-boned, scarred body in the leather 
swivel chair behind the plain, heavy 
desk. 

“I was caught by a fit of diarrhea 
and could not possibly have been 
punctual this morning.” 

“You’ve got diarrhea of the mind.” 
“That could be a compliment.” 
“Okay then, of the mouth.” He 
picked up a pencil, and Sloane ex- 
pected him to snap it in two. “I don’t 
know why I put up with you, Sloane.” 
“Because you don’t have a better 
agent. You know it.” 



126 



IF 




“Or even a more conceited one.” 
“Modesty is a false virtue.” 

“Still, now and then, it is refresh- 
ing.” 

Sloane didn’t answer. 

“Okay. Background.” Talman 
could drop right out of personal 
conversation and into a briefing so 
fast it sometimes confused the agent. 
Andt Sloane thought, perhaps it is 
meant to, “You know the history of, 
or at least you should, the Pheasant 
of Dreams, the Dreaming Pheasant, 
the Paradise Bird, the Feathered 
Fantasia. There are a dozen other 
names for it. But, to start with and 
to make sure there are no misconcep- 
tions running about in your mind, 
I’ll run through a brief history of 
Actria and the bird.” 

“Good, a story.” 

“Shut up. Now, twenty-six years 
ago, the planet called Actria was dis- 
covered and immediately brought un- 
der the protective folds of the United 
Worlds Federation. The usual inves- 
tigatory period was suspended, and 
the planet was given membership 
more quickly than any other to date. 
It was a selfish move on the part of 
the Federation. Actria was a wealthy 
world in the most important way — 
an abundant supply of novelties. 
More money is spent by citizens of 
the galaxy on novelties and entertain- 
ment within any given Earthnormal 
year than is spent on any other item. 
Actria, then, was an exploiter’s par- 
adise. There were three beautiful fur- 
bearing animals whose pelts brought 
enormous and deserved prices among 
the two hundred and forty million 
members of the upper-upper class. 
There were vast regions where all 



manners of exotic jewels lay strewn 
about the sand. And, perhaps most 
important of all these wonders, the 
Pheasant of Dreams.” 

“The Dreaming Pheasant.” 

“The Paradise Bird,” Talman 
continued. “Since Aetna’s languages 
were extremely difficult to break and 
construct a grammar for (experts 
then estimating five years necessary ) , 
the Federation members were under- 
standably anxious to get started on 
the planet’s resources before they 
could communicate with its peoples. 
So we moved in. We took the furs 
and jewels and countless other things 
without their consent, holding fifty 
percent of the earnings in escrow un- 
til the Actrians could understand 
what had happened to them. The 
council looked upon the venture as fa- 
therly.” 

“Oh, very fatherly.” 

T alman ignored him. “But in kill- 
ing the Pheasant of Dreams for 
the three-dimensional, color-changing 
feathers, the Federation henchmen 
led the bird down the road to ex- 
tinction before cracking the language 
barrier and finding out from the Ac- 
trians what the real purpose of the 
fowl was. It was an Esp-animal, a 
creature that could delve into your 
mind to bring you dreams of splen- 
dor, recreating your wildest fantasies 
so realistically, that any drug ever 
known in the galaxy p^es by com- 
parison.” 

“I never believed they could be that 
realistic,” Sloane said, slumping even 
deeper into the folds of his chair. 

“I wouldn’t know. But the Ac- 
trians seem to think they were. We 



DREAMBIRD

had to provide them with large quan- 
tities of concentrated PBT to satisfy 
their desire for escape, and still they 
longed for the birds. Now, there is 
only one pheasant left. They call it 
Eve in an optimism, hoping she will 
be the first to bring her race from 
the dark abyss it hangs over. Our- 
laboratories are working on some 
method of artificial stimulation to 
set her unfertilized eggs to growing. 
So far, no luck.” 

“And on top of all this, someone 
has tried to steal Eve.” 

“Exactly.” 

“Who?” 

Talman reached across to a green 
button on a stud-covered console at 
the right of his desk. The screen be- 
hind him lighted and a face was pro- 
jected from behind it. A wrinkled, 
withered, ancient face with slits of 
eyes and skin like crumpled paper 
left in the rain, lips like withered ap- 
ple skins, no chin. 

“Him?” 

“You know him??” 

Sloane sat up straight in his chair. 
“Certainly. It’s Tate Briscow. He’s 
probably the richest man in the gal- 
axy. Owns Planet Industries, hun- 
dreds of things. But why him?” 
“He’s two hundred and seventy- 
eight years old. Hagan-Foster treat- 
ments can keep you relatively young 
for a hundred years and relatively 
middle-aged for another hundred, 
but they can’t make you immortal. 
Eventually, you do grow old. He has 
poured billions into finding some- 
thing else to extend life and keep it 
bulging with youth. But he has failed. 
Now there is only the pheasant for 
him. He realizes, if there is to be 



any joy in his life, it will have to be 
hallucinogenic in nature from here on 
out. Thus, the bird.” 

“I rather pity him,” Sloane said. 
“Why, for God’s sake?” 

“You said yourself it would be the 
only way for him to enjoy what’s left 
of this life.” 

“Hell, AUie, he’s had a life a hun- 
dred years longer than either you or 
I will have. You have to check out 
sooner or later.” 

“The later the better.” 

T alman wiped the face off the 
screen. “Look, maybe you don’t 
understand what would happen if the 
pheasant were stolen. Actria has gain- 
ed allies in the Federation since her 
entry into galactic government. She 
votes radically conservative and could 
end up as the focal point of a war 
between liberal and conservative fac- 
tions.” 

“Impossible.” ^ 

“You think so?” 

“Well, the Secretary General 
doesn’t. He wants Briscow stopped.” 
Sloane stood and walked to an or- 
iginal Famna oil hanging on the wall 
to the left of Talman’s desk. The 
chief had led a colorful life, and it 
was reflected in his choice of art. All 
the colors were warm, flaring into 
hot even to the edges of the canvas 
where one might expect something 
darker, more subtle. Sloane didn’t 
particularly like or dislike it. “How 
do you know,” he said finally, “that 
Briscow is after the animal?” 

Talman punched another button. 
Another photo, a face from the 
mouth up flashed onto the screen. 
“This was Barney Rossman. A Bris- 



128 



IF 




cow henchman* He died trying to 
steal the bird**’ 

Sloane studied the picture. ‘*How? 
What was his plan?” 

“Somehow, Rossman was dropped 
into the reserve land above the bird’s 
dome. Supplied with atomic hand 
diggers, he worked his way down 
through the first layers of earth. He 
wasn’t disturbed by anyone, since the 
reserve is off-Hmits even to guards of 
the project. When he reached the steel 
and concrete, atomic tools were evi- 
dently brought in on another ille- 
gal flight during the night. The 
launching was probably accomplished 
from Briscow’s pleasure satellite 
which he keeps orbiting Actria by 
paying exorbitant rent to the UW. 
But there’s no proof. Anyway, Ross- 
man almost made it. He came down 
within the caverns where the dome 
rests, and of course he found that the 
guards were outside the doorways 
and not inside. He attached some 
new, high-power nuclear putty to 
the seams of the glass door and tried 
to bum it off. Given time, he might 
possibly have done it. Unfortunately 
for him, the putty reacted too vigor- 
ously with the chemical nature of the 
glass, and huge columns of smoke 
poured through the room. The guards 
thought it was a fire and came run- 
ning. Rossman was caught in the 
act.” 

“And Rossman accused Briscow. 
There you have your proof against 
the old man.” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“We know Rossman worked for 
Briscow; he has for twenty-odd years. 
But before we could get a statement 



from him, his head was neatly sev- 
ered from the rest of him.” He twist- 
ed a knob, rolling up the picture to 
show the head from the mouth down. 
There was nothing but a shredded, 
bloody stump for a neck. No body* 
“Ecchhl” 

“Agreed. Accomplished by remote 
control, probably a capsule of explo- 
sive jelly in his neck set to a certain 
signal on a certain frequency.” 
“Okay, I’m convinced.” 

T alman blanked out the picture. 

“We want you to go to Actria 
on the sub-space liner Pride this 
afternoon. Planet Industries, owned 
by Briscow, has used its influence to 
get a party of VIP’s a tour of Actria 
and the bird’s dome. We think one 
of the delegates is working for Bris- 
cow and will be after the pheasant. 
The Federation granted the tour to 
Actria because it didn’t want to rab 
Briscow the wrong way, but also 
because one of its men from the 
Funds Committee was going on the 
same ship, and refusal to one group 
while sending that diplomat could 
have aroused some resentment. Your 
cover identification to join the group 
is this: you’re a prince from one of 
the outer worlds. You will be king 
when you reach twenty-six next 
month. This is a tour to acquaint you 
with Actria, as you will make s imil ar 
tours of all the other planets.” 

“But actually. I’ll be spying.” 
“Correct” 

“On whom?” 

“Less Cannon, congressman. A lit- 
tle corrupt, but probably not a hench- 
man for Briscow. Waltham, the poet, 
rather out of question. Reamer, the 



OREAMBIRO 



129 




Union leader. We suspect he’s your 
man. He has had deals with Briscow 
in the past — salary fixing and such. 
And the last is Cossik from the Funds 
Committee upstairs, who is going to 
see how much the UW should allow 
for artificial fertilization to help the 
pheasant get pregnant. Like I said, 
probably Reamer.” 

“What time does the boat leave, 
Angelo?” 

‘Two o’clock, and be there on 
time. A sub-spacer with five-hundred 
passengers and a billion dollars in car- 
go will not wait for even you.” 

“I doubt that,” Sloane said, walk- 
ing to the door. 

“Oh, and AUie, you’ll have a back- 
up man on this.” 

“Oh, God, I hope not Smithe or 
LansdoffI” 

“No. A mutant. He has a few pow- 
ers which I think you’ll find useful.” 

Sloane nodded from the hallway as 
the door slid shut behind. 

He picked up his briefing package 
with all the necessary cover papers. 

Someone was trying to steal the 
Pheasant of Dreams. 

He had to stop them. 

But first, lunch. 

II 

I t was one hell of a pain when Bris- 
cow tried to grip anything, even 
the glass with the very small portion 
of liquor in it. It was a pain that 
surged through every bone in his 
body, erupted in his brain like a vol- 
cano. Liquid fire pain. 

But he was determined not to be- 
come a vegetable. Even Hagan-Foster 
said he had thirty to forty years left 



to him. Those years would not be 
spent lying in a bed being spoon-fed 
by girls like those to whom he once 
made lovel Never. Out of the god- 
damn question! 

He finally clamped the brittle 
sticks of bis fingers around the moist 
glass and drew it to his leathery lips. 
His secretary, Moxham, said that ice 
“bruised” the drink when you drop- 
ped so much of it in. But he liked 
liquor cold. It took either ice cold or 
boiling hot thin gs to really affect his 
taste buds anymore . 

Clutching the tiny glass like the 
flame of life, he reflected on the 
next stage in the project. Too bad 
Rossman had died. He had liked the 
fellow, although he had been a total 
idiot on many things. But the next 
stage . • • He had to work with a 
man he abhorred. A man who had 
not made his money “honestly.” A 
man who was egocentric, as all men 
are in that profession. And, worst of 
all, he was going to have to share 
the prize. 

He tried to spit on the floor, but 
he found his mouth dry. 

He rang the bell on the silver cord. 

The door opened; a servant entered. 

“Pack this in ice. More ice! I can’t 
taste the bloody thing!” 

Ill 

S loane couldn’t remember what he 
had had for lunch, but he was 
certain that it had not been any 
good. He was in a change-over period 
between one of his moods of depres- 
sion and the stolid, no-nonsense agent 
he would have to become in a few 
hours. 



130 



IF 




That was one reason he liked the 
UW police job. Between assignments 
a good deal of time could sometimes 
pass, time he could devote to sulk- 
ing. He didn’t hide the fact from 
himself that self-pity was a way of 
life with him. 

But he didn’t exactly know why. 

Rather, he would not let himself 
know. 

There were times when he wanted 
to give up everything and go run- 
ning home to the folks. But of course 
he didn’t have folks. All UW police 
were picked from Federation Orphan- 
ages so that they would have no fam- 
ily or family background to enable 
the unscrup^ous to blackmail them. 
And there would be no emotional 
ties to keep them from risking their 
lives when occasion demanded. Neat. 

He signed the name Prince De- 
moshkie Vontropos to the ship’s log, 
sent his expensive, hand-tooled lug- 
gage ahead, and followed into the 
vast belly of the swollen sub-spacer 
that, despite the bulky, absurd shape 
of it, could hop across the blackness 
to Actria in two days without once 
popping a rivet. 

'Inside, he strolled along the main 
corridor and into the lounge where 
most passengers would be awaiting 
orders to retire to their quarters and 
strap in for the liftoff, the first stage 
prior to reaching the point where the 
ship could plunge into sub-space. 
There were approximately three hxm- 
dred there in the main lounge. He 
looked about for a group of four 
that might be the party he was at- 
tached to. They would be wearing 
name tags like his own so they could 
^ot one another more easily. 



His attention was held by severe 
people even though he knew they 
were not the ones he looked for. Feo^ 
pie fascinated him. 

An old woman, bound probably for 
the special laboratories and hospitals 
of Hagan-Foster on Chalmer U, sat 
in a wheelchair, her male servant, a 
tall handsome, virile youth of eighteen 
or nineteen standing behind her, his 
hand upon her shoulder. The old 
woman stroked the rugged fingers 
with her gloved hand. 

A young couple with specks of rice 
in their hair were arguing over travel 
folders. 

“When we get there,” the man 
was saying, “the first thing we have 
to see is the tower.” 

“No, I think the Forum of Peace.” 
“But the tower is perhaps the 
greatest historical — ” 

“The ForumI” she barked. 

Sloane turned his gaze next to the 
person who had got his attention 
from the comer of his eye. She was 
blonde, blue-eyed. She was wearing 
a peek-a-boo dress, and the valley 
between the young mountains of her 
breasts was dark and smooth. 

He turned away, disgusted. All or- 
phans accepted for training as agents 
were raised as Shakers. They were 
taught how offensive (and dangerous 
to their mission) sex and liquor and 
the vices were. Sloane often marveled 
at how much Truth was contained in 
Shaker philosophy. The blonde was 
disgusting. 

A s he tried to focus his attention 
elsewhere, Sloane, trembling, 
saw a heavy-set man with a weU- 
trimmed beard making his way across 



DREAMBIRD 



131 




Ae Aunge, smiling and stopping here 
ami Aere to shake hands and ex- 
ckajige a few words with oAer pas- 
sengers. 

Slnane was trying to think where 
he had seen Ae man before. There 
was something familiar about the 
face^ the dark eyes like pieces of 
night sky dotted wiA Ae twinklings 
of stars, Ae Roman nose, the full 
head of hair, and especially Ae beard. 

The fat man walked directly to him 
and stopped. “Prince Demoshkie. I 
believe by the royal purple on the 
lapel.'’ 

The name tag on the oAer man’s 
lapel opened Ae memory block in 
Sloane’s mmd. Gregory Waltham, the 
poet. “How do you do, Mr. Wal- 
tham.” 

‘T would have been pleased if you 
had recognized me without the name 
tag.” 

“9h, I did. Sort of — ” 

WalAam patted his belly. “I have 
put on a bit of weight m the last 
moaAs. Success went to my stom- 
ach.” 

That had been the Amg Aat had 
thrown him off, Sloane realized. The 
face was rather Ain, sharp-lined, 
not at all Ae face of a fat man. 
Placed on the shoulders of the pig-like 
body, it seemed terribly out of place. 

‘The oAers are over by the foun- 
tain,” WalAam said. “Our state- 
rooms are in the same hallway, and 
I guess we might as well get to 
know one anoAer right off.” 

‘T guess so,” Sloane said. 

“You’ll be king soon, I hear.” 

Talman had done a good job of 
having the rumor spread. A small 
paragraph had even been placed in 



the Earthwide Homeopape that morn- 
ing. ‘That’s right. My parents are 
dead, and by tradition, I cannot be- 
come king until I reach Ae age of 
twenty-eight next month. My world 
has been kingless for three years. It 
will be a glorious day when I take 
the Arone,” he finished. And a cold 
day in hell, he Aought. 

“I imagine,” Waltham said. “Yes, 
I certainly can imagine.” 

They threaded their way through 
the crowd to a group of three men 
sitting by the fountain Aat was 
shaped like a whale spouting wa- 
ter from its head. It was a smgularly 
atrocious piece of sculpture, what 
with the twining vines of marble, Ae 
stone angels singing from a gilded 
carol book, the naked sirens perched 
on rocks that looked vaguely like 
dragon heads, all the things which 
Ae newly rich seem to think consti- 
tute class and refined splendor. 

W alAam introduced him to the 
others. Cannon was boisterous, 
tall, red-faced, the stereotype Texan. 
But he was far from stereotype in 
ability, for he had managed to make 
it to the United Worlds Council of 
Earth as the single representative 
from that state. A powerful man in- 
deed. Reamer was just Ae opposite. 
He was not talkative; he was short; 
his complexion was a sickly white; his 
skin was a bit on the greasy side. His 
eyes were bulging grapes painted 
white and brown and sAffed into 
his sockets. Cossik was all poise and 
charm and phoney exterior, as most 
diplomats from UW were. He ex- 
plained his mission and purpose on 
the tour, obviously greatly mterested 

IF 



132 




in the survival of the pheasant and 
the creation of more birds via arti- 
ficial fertilization. It was plain that 
he would recommend a large grant 
out of UW funds for research on 
the problem. 

“A king, eh?” the Texan said. 

“That’s right.” 

“A real, honest-to-goodness king.” 

“Yep.” 

“I read about them in story books.” 

“Oh?” 

“Yeah. You know, monarchy died 
out on Earth three hundred years 
ago.” 

Sloane didn’t answer. 

“Earth is a progressive planet, 
though, being the mother planet and 
all.” 

“I guess so.” 

“Hey,” Cannon said, waving the 
stub of a cigar, “maybe you can get 
a few pheasant feathers for the royal 
robes!” 

“That isn’t the least bit humorous,” 
Cossik said. 

“But I hear they’re real pretty.” 

“I hardly think pretty is a strong 
enough word,” Cossik snapped. 

**Beauty is the whirling of the stars 

The sound of universal music far 

Between the reaches of the suns 
and moons 

Where souls are held in silver- 
plated spoons** 

“Very nice,” Sloane told the poet. 

“From Space, Life, Eternity, and 
the Stars,” Waltham said. 

“A book?” 

“My new one, as yet not released. 
That would be a rather presumptuous 
title for a single poem, would it not?” 

“What’s it like being a king?” 
Cannon asked. 



The warning buzzer to strap ih 
saved Sloane from an answer. 

The lounge began to clear quickly, 
no one being fond of getting caught 
and mashed into the wall by blastoff. 
Several uniformed crewmen mingled 
with the people, hustling them. 

Sloane’s room was between Cos- 
sik’s and Cannon’s. He watched them 
enter their own, keyed his own lock, 
and watched as the door slid aside. 
He stepped in. The door slid shut. 

“Hello, Mr. Sloane. The name is 
Doronich Penevitch. You can call 
me Dorrie.” 

Sloane jumped at the sound of the 
voice, a hearty, deep-throated rum- 
ble. He surveyed the room but could 
see no one. The two beds were per- 
fectly made; the paintings on the 
walls were tasteful, hanging straight; 
but there was absolutely no one in 
sight. The bathroom door stood ajar 
so that he could tell that room was 
empty. Besides, the voice had been 
very close, in the main room. 

“Up here, Mr. Sloane.” 

He looked up, tried to step back. 
He was too close to the wall, and 
instead of putting any distance be- 
tween himself and the thing floating 
up there, he cracked his head against 
the metal partition. 

“Oh,” Dorrie said, “that hurt, 
huh? But I will say, most people run 
and scream at least.” 

S loane could see why. Doronich 
Penevitch was evidently the mu- 
tant that Talman had mentioned. He 
was legless, for a starter, and had 
only one arm — an enormous, ab- 
normally long arm with two elbows 
in it. The arm ended in a powerful 



DREAMBIRD 



133 




fist equipped with five fingers, each 
with four knuckles. The eyes were 
crystal blue — wide, appearing to 
sink deep into the head, mysterious, 
misty, hypnotic. The mouth was set 
below a mashed-in nose and was, 
strangely, normal. There was no chin, 
but the head connected directly to 
the one-armed trunk which was stub- 
by, squarish, about three feet long, 
and wrapped in some odd blue gar- 
ment like a toga. 

“You’re the — ” 

“Mutant,” Penevitch said, laugh- 
ing. 

Nafure sometimes repents of her 
abuses and gives the mutant some 
abnormality which is a blessing, a 
positive mutation. In Penevitch’s case, 
it was the power to levitate and pro- 
pel himself. He could not walk, but 
he could fly. And, seemingly, in some 
strange way, he was quite happy. 

Sloane realized, if he were the 
thing floating up there, he would 
have to commit suicide. It was not 
within his personality to live like that. 

Penevitch floated down towards the 
bed he had obviously chosen for his 
own, settled gently upon the covers. 
“I must say, though, you do stare a 
lot.” 

Sloane blinked and tried to regain 
himself. “I never ran into a . a . 
severe mutant before.” 

“Really? Do you think I’m se- 
vere?” 

“WeU — ” 

“No offense will be taken. I’m in- 
terested, strictly as the laboratory 
specimen might be, in what you peo- 
ple on the other side of the glass 
think of me. So, do you think I’m a 
severe case?” 



Sloane advanced, sat down on 
the comer of his own bed. “I’ve 
worked with a lip-reading mutant who 
could perform perfectly by catching 
only one word in ten and who could 
read ninety percent correctly on fa- 
cial expression alone; he had an ex- 
tra arm. I’ve worked with the only 
known paranorm in the galaxy, the 
fellow with the two heads. But this 
is really the first case, yes, in which 
I would say the mutant was severe.” 
“I like honesty,” Penevitch said. 
The crystal eyes stared steadily at 
Sloane. “But now let*me tell you 
some things. I don’t consider myself 
severe. Severe mutants are objects 
of pity, the mistakes of Nature as 
she tried to correct for the mistakes 
of Man in the Great War. I don’t 
however, pity myself. I pity humans 
you ordinary people. You cannot 
fly; you cannot lift yourself above 
the canyons and mountains and stare 
down unless you’re encumbered by 
a bulky plane or fly-suit; you can’t 
float through the center of a thun- 
der storm and listen to Thor talk and 
the gods laugh. I can. Also, you can- 
not Listen in on any conversation 
within a mile because of the talk- 
shields that foul up your directional 
mikes. I can. And that suits me fine, 
since I tend to be a voyeur.” 

“Wait,” Sloane said, standing. 
“You’re able to hear any conversa- 
tion within a mile?” 

“Right.” 

“Could you — ” 

“Tune in next door? Certainly.” 
He floated off the bed. “That’s nec- 
essary. I mustn’t be touching any- 
thing if I wish the reception to be 
clear.” 



134 



IF 




T here was a moment of quiet. 
Stillness. 

The room seemed suddenly stuffy 
to Sloane. 

The air seemed about to sparkle 
and flame. 

It was Cossik’s room. 

“He’s singing — humming really. 
Something from Scheherazade, I 
think. Yes, definitely. The Story of 
the Kalander Prince.’ You know the 
piece.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t much follow 
music.” 

“Oh, but you should. Especially the 
classics. My favorite arrangement of 
this piece is the ancient Philadelphia 
Symphony when it was directed by 
Ormandy. Ormandy was a genius. 
And on some recordings, Anshel 
Brusilow plays solo violin. Superb.” 
“Is that all he’s doing?” 

“The original piece on that Or- 
mandy album lasts almost twenty-two 
minutes and is simply — oh a master- 
piece, an experience in itself!” 

“Is he only humming?” Sloane 
persisted. 

“And then they also do a grand 
job on Ravel’s Alborada del gracioso, 
I don’t think any — ” 

Penevitch! Is he doing any damn 
thing else besides humming?” 

“Oh. Oh, sorry. No. The water 
seems to be running. I’d say he’s 
taking a quick shower before blast- 
off.” 

“How about the other side? That’s 
the Texan, Cannon.” 

The blue eyes shifted to the other 
wall. “He’s mumbling to himself.” 
“What’s he saying?” 

“It sounds like cursing, but its too 
low to make out.” 



“And Reamer, the union man?” 
“Nothing.” 

“You’re sure?” 

‘^rtain.” 

‘Talman seems to ithink we’U 
have to watch him especially.” 

“I know.” 

“Talman briefed you personally?” 
Sloane asked, taking a step toward 
the mutant. 

“Of course.” 

“I thought only the senior agent 
was advised by the chief.” 

“I am the senior here,” Penevitch 
said good-naturedly. “AAA Officer 
Penevitch. You’re AA, I believe.” 
“WeU, I’ll be damned!” 
“Sometimes, self-pity is what holds 
back a mutant, Mr. Sloane. I — ” 
He paused, his eyes peering one 
way, then another. 

“What’s the matter?” 

“Someone nearby just said ‘Out to 
steal a g-goddamn pheasant. Now 
isn’t that really ironic?’ and laughed.” 

IV 

▼ ▼ “I don’t hear anything else.” 
“Nothing at all?” 

“At least nothing by that voice.” 
“Who was it?” 

“Mr. Sloane, I can hear through 
walls; I can’t see through them. An 
average voice. It was the tone of a 
man talking to himself. And he stut- 
tered on the curse word.” 

“Someone with a speech defect. 
That doesn’t fit anyone in the party.” 
“You’ve heard sdl of them speak?” 
“Yes. No stutterer.” 

Penevitch drifted back onto the 
bed. “Perhaps it is an occasional 



DREAMBIRD 



135 




stutter. Maybe you didn’t hear them 
^eak often enough to catch it.’* 

**The only one who was quiet was 
Reamer. 1 don’t believe he said 
more than a dozen words. The others 
talked incessantly when the conversa- 
tion got around to things they knew 
something about.” 

“So. Perhaps Ben is right. Reamer 
may be our man.” 

The intercom crackled above the 
door. “SECURE FOR LAUNCH! 
ALL PASSENGERS SECURE FOR 
LAUNCH! NOW!” 

“How,” Sloane said curiously, “by 
the way, do you strap in?” 
Penevitch chuckled. “A good ques- 
tion worthy of demonstration.’* He 
floated to his suitcase, reached out 
with the gigantic arm from the folds 
of the robe, and worked the latch 
with the nimble fingers, springing 
back the top. Drawing out a strange 
net affair, he said, “This.” 

It attached to the light fixture in 
the ceiling by a sturdy cord and to 
the ceiling itself by means of two 
magnets. He floated into it, zipped up 
the opening. “This way. Rather like 
a banana on the tree.” 

Sloane, in spite of himself, laughed. 
“I like you, Penevitch.” 

“Dorrie. And I like you, Sloane.” 
“Fine.” 

“Allie.” 

“Good.” 

“Now you better strap yourself 
in,” the mutant said, “or you’ll look 
a helluva lot worse than I do.” 
Sloane crawled into one of the two 
slope-backed chairs, worked himself 
into the harness and seatbelt. 

“I’m your servant and jester, by the 
way.” 

136 



Sloane looked up amazed. “What?” 
“That’s the cover story. I’m a dis- 
tant cousin from> Earth, bom mu- 
tated. You keep me because I tell 
good jokes and can do menial tasks, 
but mainly because you pity me.” 
“Pity you?'* 

“I know. But I’ll snivel a lot in 
front of people and bump into things 
when I levitate and generally act like 
an idiot.” 

T he ooga horn sounded, the last 
warning to strap in. A dinosaur 
mating call, melancholy. 

The hull began vibrating softly. 
“What is your real story?” Sloane 
asked. 

“It’s not pretty.” 

“I guess not.” 

“My mother died in childbirth, 
and my father would have killed me, 
so they say, if he could have. He evi- 
dently wasn’t a very tolerant man. At 
least, he never came to see me in the 
special homes even though he was in- 
formed that my I.Q. was a hundred 
and seventy-five and that I was per- 
fectly sound of mind — almost ab- 
normally sound of mind. So, I never 
bothered to look him up either.” 
“And how did you get involved 
with U.W. police?” 

“I was — ” Penevitch began just 
as the sudden dragon roar of engines 
crashed upon them and the ship be- 
gan to shake like a Polynesian drop- 
ped from the sky onto an iceberg. 
The sack with Penevitch in swung 
back and forth from the ceiling like 
the pendulum of a clock. 

Sloane felt his face muscles begin 
to tighten as speed was increased. 
The sack ceased swaying, hung as 

IF 




if it were starched and nailed to the 
ceiling at a forty-five degree angle, 
anything but a plumb line. 

The whirring grew in both their 
ears. 

But whereas it was annoying to 
Sloane, it was exceedingly painful to 
Penevitch. 

That was one of the rare times 
he cried. 

He wrapped the long arm about the 
trunk and clutched at himself, unable 
to shut off the super-sensitive pieces 
of his mind and ears. 

And he wept. 

When they finally broke into free- 
space and started the two-million-mile 
trip to the point where they would 
enter sub-space, the mutant forced 
his voice into calm, coughed, and 
began where he had left off, hav- 
ing voiced none of his pain, 

Sloane had always hked a man who 
could pick up an interrupted con- 
versation at the exact point where it 
had stopped. It showed a singleness 
of purpose, a clear mind. He noticed 
the ability in Penevitch. 

“I came to the attention of Tal- 
man because of my talents. Levita- 
tion is sometimes useful, but more 
often than not, one profits in this 
business from overheard conversa- 
tions. He came to see me in the spe- 
cial homes after I had taken a T.V. 
Degree in American Literature from 
the SorBonne. First, it was the patrio- 
tic, peace-lover, do-gooder speech 
about my obligations to the freedom 
and the process of maintaining peace 
throughout the galaxy. He pointed 
out that had peace b^n maintained 
before my time, I would not have 
been born a mutant. But that didn’t 



appeal to me. As I said, there’s noth- 
ing to pity in me. People generally 
leave me alone because of what I 
am, alienate me, but since ninety- 
five percent of our populace consists 
of asses, ignoramuses, and petty 
minds, I don’t care how far away 
they stay. 

“Then he tried money. That work- 
ed. I imagine I’m paid double what 
you are. And what you get is a small 
fortune in itself.” 

Sloane whistled his appreciation. 
“So. I’m wealthy. I live a much 
more exciting life than the two-legged, 
two-armed man-on-the-street. I like 
it.” 

Sloane unstrapped himself. “Well, 
banana, if you’ll get out ^of that 
bunch, maybe we can meet with the 
other members of our party in the 
dining room and give them a check- 
ing out over dinner.” 

“Agreed,” Penevitch said, unzip- 
ping the net. “If they’ve any appetite, 
that is.”

And he was immediately sorry he 
had not whispered. He could feel 
the thin trickle of rusty blood work- 
ing its way down his throat towards 
his shrunken stomach. Now he would 
have a sore throat for hours. He 
could not even scream at people any- 
more. He thought that he might miss 
that more than anything. Now and 
then it was a pleasure to scream. 
Tate Briscow had always been known 
for his fog horn voice, his thunder 
tones.

He looked back at the paper in 
his hands. It was the decoded tele- 
gram received from the Pride. He 
fumed In the back of his mind 
lurked the thought that he was get- 
ting too old, but he would not allow 
that image of feeble-mindedness to 
gain dominance. Instead, he took out 
his fury on the accomplice onboard 
the Pride. That man was so damned 
fond of verbosityl He could have 
said what had to be said in twenty 
words. But it took him three hun- 
dred! The four hundred credits it had 
cost were not to be sneered at. 

Even a multi-billionaire, Briscow 
thought, learns to be careful with 
his small change. 

But this man was not responsible 
enough to think of that. 

Still, it was comforting to know 
that things were progressing nicely, 
that only fourteen hours remain^ 
until touchdown on Actria, and that 
soon the Paradise Bird would be his. 

He slobbered slightly and felt it 
run down the cracked flesh of his 
chin. His brain spinning with the 
heat of joint and muscle, bone and 
flesh pain, he forced his hand up and 
wiped it away. 

All of it. 

When he had accomplished that, 
he felt quite superior and healthy 
indeed.

U ever ...” 

Her eyes were black discs set be- 
fore flames that consumed everything 
belund her skin . She told him he 
must never da it again. And there 



were hot lead fingers melting in his 
brain to help put the point across . 

Sloane woke sweating, having 
immediately forgotten what the dream 
was about. He knew it must have 
been the same dream,' for he had 
woken in the same manner — his 
heart pounding, a scream perched on 
the edge of his trembling lips. He 
was soaked with perspiration. The 
l umin ous clock arms on the wall said 
it was 3:00 in the morning. A fa- 
miliar time. 

He lit a cigarette from the pack on 
the end table and lay back, puffing 
in great lungfuls, heaving them out 
again, softly. He wished to Hell he 
could remember the dream. How 
many times? A hundred? No, thou- 
sands. He could not rernember ex- 
actly when it had all started, though 
he did know it had been long, long 
ago. The mystery of it continued. 

“Was it bad?” a voice asked. 

“You’re awake,” Sloane said, start- 
ing to sit up. 

“One couldn’t very well sleep with 
you moaning and tossing around like 
that. Was it bad?” 

“I can’t remember,” Sloane said, 
reclining again. “I have had it a 
thousand times — I guess — but I 
can never remember what it is 
about?” 

“Perhaps you should see a psychi- 
atrist.” 

“No, he wouldn’t help.” 

“He would.” 

“He would not!” Sloane nearly 
screamed. 

There was a time of silence and 
darkness. 

“I’m •sorry,” Sloane said at last. 
“I have no reason to shout.” 



138 



IF 




“That’s all right You were ex- 
hibiting a common stumbling block 
in problems like yours.” 

“What is that?” 

“Subconsciously, maybe almost 
consciously, you know what the 
dream is about but you won’t admit 
it You don’t want to have to face 
it You know a psychiatrist will draw 
it out of you, so you avoid going to 
one.*’ 

“You think?” 

“I know.** 

“An amateur psychiatristi What 
mcHre could 1 ask for in a badcup 
man?” 

“One who is rested in the morn- 
ing,” Penevitch answered. “I think 
ru conk out now before you start 
dreaming again and all chances are 
lost.” 

“I think,” Sloane said, “Fll sing and 
stomp my feet to the beat to help 
you drift off.” 

“You’re too kind,” Penevitch said, 
politely. “But my taste doesn’t run to 
Sousa marches. Goodnight.” 

J ust before eight o’clock, Sloane 
woke again, spitting words be- 
tween his clenched teeth: “Don’t 
you ever, ever, ever ...” 

“What?” Penevitch asked, coming 
from the bathroom. 

“Oh, nothing. Nothing.” 
‘Touchdown today,” Penevitch 
announced as he went through the 
jiggling, fumbling process of squirm- 
ing into a purple robe. 

“And now the fun begins.” 

“I’d hardly call it fun.” 

“I thought you enjoyed your 
work.” 

“I do. Murder and assassination 



cases are intriguing. But kidnapping 
the last Pheasant is a little too cruel 
to be fun.” 

“You amaze me,” Sloane said, 
closing the bathroom door behind 
himself. 

The hydraulic gangplank stretched 
down to the green soil of Actria. The 
space port was not especially large 
and not especially small. Actria be- 
ing a peaceful phmet, there had never 
been need to dock battle craft. Yet 
a port was necessary, for tourist traf- 
fic was high, Actria being a planet 
of great natural beauty. Even now, to 
the west, Sloane could make out the 
glittering peaks of the Jewel Moun- 
tains where volcanic activity — eons 
ago — with the help of pools of 
heavy gases had slowly formed 
mountains of glass, smooth and near 
mirage-like mountains. Indeed, the 
planet was the perfect setting for the 
Pheasant of Dreams, the Soulbird, 
the very last and only Paradise Bird 
in the universe. 

That someone was trying to steal. 

Dorrie floated at shoulder level. 
Over the last two days, the passengers 
and other members of the party had 
gotten used to him. Some would even 
look directly at him and smile. 
“Those,” Dorrie had said, “I don’t 
like. Among those who won’t look 
at me, however, there are three types: 
the ones who are ashamed, the ones 
who don’t want to hurt my feelings 
by staring, and a few who just plain 
don’t give a damn. I would like to 
know those last few. Pity I can’t 
pick them out.” 

Ahead of them walked the others. 
Cossik W£fi lumbering off the plank 
to greet the Actrian guide, a member 



DREAMBIRn 



139 




of the totally humanoid race that was 
dominant here. The only deviation 
from Earthnormal among the Actrian 
was their eyes — eyes that swirled 
with color, changed and flooded 
from crimson to yellow to blue. It 
was very distracting. 

Reamer, Waltham, and the Texan 
strolled behind, pointing at the dis- 
tant mountains. Sloane could pic- 
ture the poet making a poignant 
comment which the other two would 
not appreciate at all. 

“TTiey all, at this moment, look 
like such innocent children,” he 
whispered to Dorrie. 

“One of them gave up his mar- 
bles and pogo-sticks long ago.” 

Sloane started to laugh, then saw 
Cossik handing a folded piece of 
yellow paper to the waiting Actrian. 
The Actrian palmed it and made no 
show of having received anything. 

“Gentlemen,” the alien said as 
Sloane and Dorrie reached the bot- 
tom of the plank behind the others, 
“welcome to Actria.” 

VII 

T hey were told about their hotel 
— Hotel Fantastique — and 
about their tour. Today they would 
see the Caves of Love; tonight there 
would be a fancy dress ball in their 
honor. 

“The air cars are at the gate,” 
the Actrian Klee said. 

There were three waiting craft. 
As Sloane expected, Cossik ended up 
in Klee’s vehicle. \V^en he and Dor- 
rie were seated in their own craft, 
floating toward the hotefc he said, 
‘•You saw the exchange?” 



“Naturally. Hais are niy speciality, 
but I do have eyes.” 

^ “Can you listen in?” 

“I already am.” 

“And?” 

‘•No intrigue. He wants to ascer- 
tain from Klee how much the lab- 
oratories here need. Right now, they 
are discussing ways of padding the 
funds request.” 

“Well, it did seem like we were 
on to something.” 

Dorrie sighed. “It would be a pity 
finding out so soon — before all the 
adventure.” 

The air car floated down to the 
base of the steps that stretched up 
to the Fantastique’s golden, engraved 
doors that were tied back with vel- 
vet-covered cables and flanked the 
entrance to the main lobby. Every- 
one met inside, was assigned rooms, 
freshened up, and set out for the 
Caves of Love. 

They saw the mountain of glass, 
the plains of onyx, the Caves of Love. 
And upon seeing the latter. Reamer 
stuttered. But so did Waltham, Cos- 
sik, and the Texan. Indeed, it was a 
sight to make a man lose control of 
his tongue in the describing of it. 
Dorrie and Sloane were rather nerv- 
ous for the remainder of the day’s 
tour. 

When they returned to the hotel, 
Cossik, Reamer, and Waltham went , 
off to Transmitter Incorporated to 
send messages to relatives, messages 
bearing the romantic postmark of 
Actria. Cannon wandered off with 
Klee. In a quick moment of decision, 
Dorrie floated off after them, asking 
if Klee were going to show Mr. Can- 
non any more scenery.

he thought, it was something from 
Talman. He untied the box, lifted the

“Could I come? Please?” 



“Well, I — ” 

“Sure,” Cannon boomed, “let the

“What are we going to see?” 

“The . red-light districts. And

waiting for him to open the message 
and see whether he had any instruc-

and glance at the wor^: “HAVE

What a delightful move, attempting 
to drive the prince insane! 

He looked back up at the dark- 
haired lovely. “My dear — ” he 
whispered. 

She stepped forward, smiling, try- 
ing to hear what it was he said. 

He wanted to touch her. He want- 
ed to feel her softness beneath his 
mummy fingers. Painfully, he began

to raise his hand from the arm of 
the chair. 

DC 

S loane saw the lovely hills with 
thick, green trees, the tangle 
of underbrush. He could hear the 
trilling of birds like thin, sweet flutes. 
He had always like it here. 

The grapevines twined through the 
bars of the arbor, the ripe bunches 
of their labor sagging from them, 
bulbous and heavy. Crickets sang. 
Dandelions had turned to puff. 

**Allie,** a soft voice said from be- 
hind . 

He turned, looked . 

Screamed! There was something 
familiar about all of this, something 
he did not want to remember . 

He screamed. His eyes stung, and 
his throat burned. He twisted the 
neck in his hands, mangling, crush- 
ing. 

There were shouts in the hall. 
Blood spurted from a tom artery 
and splashed his face. Still he shred- 
ded it, screaming. 

Fists beat upon the door. 

When they finally got in, they 
found him smashing the small form 
of the puppy-like creature into the 
terrazzo floor, again and again. 

Over and over. There was blood 
on everything. 

They had to pry it from his clutch- 
ing fingers. They washed him and 
placed him in bed and gave him a 
sedative and stationed a sentry by 
his bed to call the doctor when the 
prince-king showed signs of waking. 
And for some hours, Sloane slept a 
dreamless sleep. 



W hen he woke, the doctor was 
there, taking his pulse. He was 
a mustached man with a head of 
white hair. Somehow the aurora bo- 
realis of his eyes was heightened by 
the whiteness of his hair. In the far 
corner, Dorrie floated, obviously wor- 
ried. Waltham was sitting in a chair 
behind the doctor. 

“Ah, awake now,” the Actrian 
said. 

“Uhh, partially.” 

“You’ve had a bad experience.” 

“I vaguely remember.” 

“Well, we aren’t going to pamper 
you. The best thing in these cases is 
to get on your feet. I suggest the 
party tonight. In fact. I’m leaving 
it to Mr. Waltham to make you 
attend.” 

“But what — ” 

“He can explain too,” the physi- 
cian said, picking up his instrument 
bag. “I have t© deliver a baby.” He 
hustled out. 

“Well, Gregory, explain.” 

“It was a Nightmare Rat. 

“Rat?” 

“I know it doesn’t look at all like 
a rat. It’s cute and cuddly, and that’s 
part of the danger. You see, for ev- 
erything Nature makes, she makes 
an antithesis.” 

“I see,” Sloane said groggily, “the 
Pheasant of Dreams and the Night- 
mare Rat.” 

“I was one of the first to your 
door, and I knew immediately — 
from the manner in which you were 
babbling — what was wrong. We 
broke the door down to get to you.” 
He motioned to where a new door 
sat on new hinges. “We poets, you 
see, are a bohemian lot. We try all

the drugs over the years. I still smoke 
a little marijuana now and again. 
Years ago, when these creatures were 
first discovered, right after the true 
purpose of the pheasant was found 
out too late, they became the new 
“drug” of the In set. They were not 
pretty and had not been exterminated 
by UW for their furs, so they were 
plentiful. With friends to snatch them 
from you if you get too violent, the 
experience is not so horrible — 
though still a nightmare. In your case, 
there was no one to snatch.” 

“But, how — ” 

“It re-creates, by touching upon 
your mind, the worst traumatic expe- 
riences of your life.” 

Waltham shifted his great stomach. 
He pursed his thin lips and said, 
“Just what the Hell did it re-create 
for you that made you so violent? 
There was nothing left of it but pulp.” 
“I — ” Sloane looked to Dorrie. 
“I can’t remember.” 

Waltham gave him an unbelieving 
stare. 

“It’s true,” Dorrie said. “He has a 
repeating dream that he caimot re- 
call once awake. This is evidently the 
same dream, and even the Nightmare 
Rat couldn’t force him to relive it 
and remember.” 

“You should see a psychiatrist,” 
the poet advised. 

“Don’t start that,” Dorrie said. 
“His superego intrudes and begins 
screaming all over the place. It isn’t 
pleasant.” 

Waltham began to rise. “Why the 
devil did you get such a thing if you 
were slightly unstable to begin with?” 
“It was a gift, sent by the Con- 
sulate.” 



“False,” Dorrie said. “I checked. 
They mailed no such package. The 
postmark places it at a common 
street depository with no means of 
checking the sender.” 

“Well, Prince, I’d say you have 
enemies somewhere — as, I guess, 
all monarchs do. But extremely nasty 
ones. A bullet would have been more 
certain and less painful.” 

Sloane pushed himself to the edge 
of the bed. “Did the doctor really 
say movement was best? My head is 
falling apart.” 

“He’s right. I told him my past as- 
sociation with the little beasts, and he 
asked me to guide you this evening, 
keep you moving until the trauma has 
been washed from your conscious 
mind. So, dress and move. We’ve a 
party to attend.” 

T he grande ballroom was a won- 
derland of crystal chandeliers 
and rich, heavy tapestries. But the 
dancers were brackking rather than 
waltzing, flinging their bodies this 
way and that to the pounding, driv- 
ing beat of the brackk music from 
the seven-man band. The sounds 
washed over Sloane like tidal waves. 

Dorrie, however, seemed to enjoy 
it. 

“Are you certain?” Waltham was 
saying above the roar. 

“Yes.” 

“But the doctor said — ” 

“I’m fine, Gregory. Thank you for 
your time, I couldn’t have made it 
without you. I’m feeling fine now, 
however. Go enjoy yourself.” 

“Okay,” the poet said, shrugging 
his shoulders. “I certainly will.” And 
he bounced off through the crowd 



144 



IF 




toward the bar, the thin hands hang- 
ing beside the enormous body. 

Dorrie floated up close. “Nothing 
gained from going with Klee and 
Cannon. They went to view the wrong 
side of the tracks; Cannon was out 
to prove his virility. That’s all.” 
“Perhaps they weren’t planning 
that trip until you interrupted their 
escape.” 

“Possible. But I doubt it. Somehow, 
Cannon doesn’t seem bright enough 
to be involved with a plan like this.” 
“He’s not too much of a goon. Re- 
member, he is chief delegate of an 
entire state.” 

“I guess so.” 

Sloane looked around at the danc- 
ers. A strobe light had been brought 
into a comer of the room. The wild, 
leaping shadows of the brackkers 
flicked over the walls, glittered dark- 
ly in the chandelier. “Let’s split and 
reconnoiter. Mingle. I doubt if there’s 
anything to be picked up here, but 
try. Keep an eye on as many of the 
delegation as you can. If one of them 
escapes «your attention for any length 
of time, get hold of me fast.” 

“Right, Captain.” 

“And especially watch Reamer and 
Cossik. For some reason. I’m as wor- 
ried about that diplomat as 1 am 
about our prime suspect.” 

“You’re just getting paranoid.” 
Sloane watched the mutant float 
away then began surveying the ac- 
tion. There were about three hun- 
dred people present, most of them 
important figures on the political 
scene. There was a great deal of 
gaiety, the type which is boisterous, 
bubbling, and more often than not, 
phoney. 



“Excuse me,” a voice said to his 
left, “aren’t you Prince Demoshkie?” 

H e turned and looked into the face 
face of a fair, thin girl-won>- 
an of about twenty or twenty-one. 
She was wearing a black sheath 
that rose from below her knees to 
end in a high collar that clutched at 
the pale line of her throat. Her chest, 
in between, was boyish, almost flat. 

Her eyes were crimson and violet 
and orange . 

Now blue-black . 

“Yes, I am. Miss — ” 

“Frandida. Monavisa Frandida. I 
have never met royalty before.” 

“I’m not very royal. Only a 
prince.” 

“But you will be a king.” 

“Yes. Soon.” 

“You don’t look like a king,” she 
said, her eyes suddenly all white and 
beautiful. She was actually neuter in 
sex, her eyes like all Actrian eyes, 
her body so very thin. 

“I didn’t know a king was sup- 
posed to look a certain way.” 

She laughed again. “Well, stem. 
Possibly with a dueling scar below 
steel gray eyes.” 

The music of the brackkers erupted 
anew — the crashing mountains, the 
crumpling of clouds as the dead 
body of God falls upon them. 

“This way,” she talk/ shouted, 
fflldng his hand and leading him 
through the clusters of people, be- 
yond a tapestry, and onto a bal- 
cony overlooking the huge hotel lake. 
The dual moons shone upon the wa- 
ter, one casting the red light of an- 
ger, the other the soft white light of 
peace.

“What do you do here?” he asked. 

“My father is on the hotel board 
of directors. I always wrangle invita- 
tions to these affairs.” 

“God, aren’t you bored to tears?” 

She laughed again. A young laugh 
it was, adolescent, quick. “No. As 
a matter of fact, I find it all very 
exciting.” She motioned toward the 
ballroom. “In there, all sorts of se- 
cret tete-a-tetes are being planned — 
espionage, secret deals. Everything is 
going on under all that pretense!” 

“And you’d like to be part of it?” 

“Wouldn’t you?” 

“Oh, I don’t imagine it would be 
all that thrilling.” 

“What would you consider excit- 
ing?” 

“A good meal. I haven’t had a 
really good meal since boarding the 
Prider 

She laughed, leaned to him, kissed 
his lips. 

D one by anyone else, it would 
have been repulsive. Vaguely, 
he knew it was wrong, that the body 
was dirty. But he didn’t seem to mind 
with her. She held his hand. 

“Well,” he said suddenly, “I have 
to be getting back in there.” 

“Oh?” 

“Yes.” 

“But why?” 

“Appearances, you know. Royalty 
and all that.” 

“But you said it bores you.” 
He wanted to run from the near- 
ness, the warmth of her. 

“We could walk,” she suggested. 
‘There is a great deal you have not 
seen in our city.” 

He didn’t want to; he did want to. 

IF 




It was a new and confusing feeling. 
“Perhaps to the Gardens of Gold,” 
he said. 

She frowned. “Well, I thought, per- 
haps, to the Fountains of Hope.” 

‘Tve seen those so often in the 
films. 1 couldn’t bear the noise of all 
that water anyway. The Gardens.” 
“Okay. But I have to fix my face. 
Wait here.” 

“I’U wait.” 

She walked off behind the tapestries. 
Seconds later, the cloth parted again 
“There you are,” Dorrie said, float- 
ing over in his formal white attire. 
“Womanizing, I see.” 

9f 

“No need to explain.” 

Sloane strolled along the balcony 
that hung from three sides of the 
building. “I didn’t intend to explain.” 
“I didn’t see you. I thought per- 
haps something had happened.” 
“Nothing. And there’s no need for 
you to explain.” 

“Rather like the calm before the 
storm in there,” Dorrie said. 

“How can you stand the music?” 
They rounded the comer of the 
balcony, kept on walking. 

“Oh, actually, parts of that stuff 
have been just about lifted whole 
from Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantas- 
tique. Really not so bad at all if they 
weren’t so godawful loud about it.” 
They stopped and looked at the 
moon reflections. 

S uddenly, Sloane started. 

‘What’s the matter?” 

“I just heard my name. WeD, 
Prince Demoshkie, anyway.” 

Penevitch floated at shoulder level 
and cast out the nets of his ears. 



“You did. You certainly did.” 

“What’s being said?” 

“It’s mostly one-sided. Man and 
woman. She: but you can’t expect 
me to steer him forcefidly to the 
fountains. He: try. She: he’ll suspect 
something. Besides, he can be gotten 
in the damn gardens just as easily. 
He: no. She: listen, maybe you thiifk 
it’s easy to — ” 

Sloane lept over the balcony rail, 
clambored down the lattice work to 
the patio below. Dorrie dropped be- 
hind him. When he hit the ground, 
the man had run. The girl was still 
there, confused. She turned to him, 
mouth open, colorful eyes wide. 

Black-red . 

Swirling, twisting, washing the 
globe of her eye, the colors came. 

He grabbed her shoulders, shook 
her. “What the hell? You’re with 
him!” 

“Who?” she asked, all innocence. 

“You know, slut! They were right 
They were always right!” 

“Who was right?” she asked. 

“Who?” Dorrie echoed. 

“Damnit, they were! You’re no 
good! Slut!” 

“But — ” 

“You’re on Briscow’s payroll, 
aren’t you? You’re working for Tate 
Briscow!” 

Briscow: a word transmitted, 

flowing through space invisibly. 

Briscow: a word picked up on a 
machine to send a certain signal on a 
certain frequency. 

Briscow: deathword. 

Sloane staggered backwards when 
she exploded. He caught her in his 
arms, her torn neck dangling precar- 
iously from her shoulders. He man-

age4 to drop her gently to the floor 
before turning to the balcony and 
bringing up all undigested things with- 
in hint. 

Police came. 

They absolved him of any guilt. 

Nothing was solved. The police 
left. 

Everything yet to come rested 
heavily on their shoulders as they 
tried to sleep. Sloane was certain he 
would have a new dream — one with 
a boyish girl spouting blood like a 
fountain. But it was the old dream 
again. The other nightmare . 

X 

B en Talman read the de-coded ca- 
ble again and sighed. It was 
certain now that there was a Briscow 
man in the party. But outside of that, 
they had found nothing. And today 
was the day they would visit the 
Cave of the Pheasant. Sloane’s mes- 
sage was not in the least encouraging. 
And Penevitch’s was worse yet. 
The mutant seemed to think that 
Sloane was on the verge of mental 
breakdown. Dreams, nightmares, the 
mutant said. WeU, that wasn’t like 
the Sloane he knew. But then, Pen- 
evitch had never made a mistake in 
judgment in the past. 

He was cemented in the middle. 
He couldn’t take Sloane out on 
one man’s opinion. He couldn’t 
plunge a new agent into the scene 
without arousing everyone’s suspi- 
cions. 

He was cemented right in the god- 
damn middle. 

There was only one thing he 
could do: nothing. 



B riscow did not like girl killing. 

It had not been so bad with 
Rossman. Men kill men. 

But a woman. That was different. 
But of course, it was to be ex- 
pected. Working with a bumbling oaf 
like that, one could expect mis- 
takes. If only he had been younger, 
only a hundred years younger, he 
would be down there taking care of 
it himself. Everything would be over 
now. The pheasant would be his. 

And if he had been able to do it 
alone, did not have to use this self- 
centered front man, he could have 
had the bird all to himself. There 
would have been no sharing it. Of 
course, there would be no sharing it 
anyway. He would have to kill the 
bumbling oaf. That would be a pleas- 
ure. It was sad he couldn’t perform 
the murder himself. If he had only 
been a hundred years younger, he 
would have been able to wipe out the 
man himself. 

But now his hands were rags.

T he escalator that rushed down be- 
neath the reserve lands, crashing 
toward the lower levels of the muse- 
um, was just about fast enough to 
pin the air out of his lungs and keep 
it out. Sloane held tightly to the rail, 
his knuckles white, gritting his teeth, 
admiring the way Dorrie paced the 
moving stairs, obviously unhurried. 

The next few minutes would do the 
telling, and stUl they had no plan. 
But what plan coid they have? 
Could it be Cannon who was always 
trying to dodge away — although he 
seemed only to be hunting more time

in which to patronize the local pros- 
titutes? There was Cossik so terribly 
interested in the bird and the funds 
he might get for artificial fertiliza- 
tion, who might also be interested in 
procurring the pheasant for Briscow. 
After all, Cossik was in the perfect 
position. He could ask questions 
about the reserve and the pheasant 
without arousing suspicion and 
could probably even touch the bird 
if he asked. And there was Reamer 
who was untalkative and mysterious 
and highly suspect. Waltham seemed 
the least threat; his interest in the bird 
was one of a poet: beauty, exoticism, 
and the soul-stirring romanticism of 
the last-of-its-kind quality of the 
creature. But Sloane was even sus- 
picious of Klee. Klee had been at the 
party and could have been talking to 
the dead girl. And since the girl was 
Actrian, why not secret the agent of 
Tate Briscow? And an Actrian, con- 
stantly on concentrated PBT, long- 
ing for the days when the Pheasant 
of Dreams was there for anyone to 
use . 

But he had to concentrate on the 
delegation. It was the delegation that 
harbored a thief. Yet, they all looked 
so guilty and innocent at once, 
Sloane was too perplexed to make 
any judgment. 

They toured the two floors below 
the pheasant’s dome and worked their 
way upwards through the exhibits to- 
ward the grandest attraction of all: 
soulbird. 

Sloane was surprised, first of all, 
by the size of it. He had imagined it 
to be huge. But it was roughly the 
size of two fists side-by-side. The 
beak was blunt and orange. The 



feathers were all that people claimed 
they were. They swam with color. 
But unlike Actrian eyes, the colors 
were three-dimension^. Behind the 
lighter reds, darker reds were swirl- 
ing; behind the greens, darker greens. 
Mixing, bubbling, flowing, forming 
faces like the clouds do sometimes, 
then breaking almost immediately, re- 
forming. 

Red on red on red over green un- 
der blue. 

Sloane placed a hand on his belt, 
ready to toss it up and strike for the 
pistol beneath his jacket. 

A dragon’s face of red under red 
over black. 

Cannon stood with his hands in his 
pockets. “Yes sir, some great animal 
there. We don’t have them like that 
back home!” 

A girl’s face on white below 
green. 

“Mighty fine bird!” Cannon agreed 
with himself. 

S loane didn’t like the hands hidden 
in the pockets. But he looked 
at the others. Cossik was closest to 
the glass wall. Indeed, his nose wm 
pressed against it. That didn’t look 
good either. Klee was giving a brief 
history of the bird. Reamer was 
standing to the side.' His arms were 
folded across his chest, a posture 
which placed both hands under his 
coat. Sloane limbered his hand, made 
ready to grab his own weapon. 

Crimson, cinnabar, over cinnabar, 
crimson . 

Reamer looked at him, looked 
away. 

Sloane swept his eyes around the 
group. Any one of them could be on

the ver^ of making his move. They 
all looked ready to jump. All except 
Waltham. But where was Waltham? 
He had forgotten the gentle poet He 
turned to see Waltham behind them. 

“So d^lamned beautifull” Wal- 
tham stuttered. 

The poet with the thin face and 
fat belly tugged on a black cord with- 
in his coat. 

He began to deflate, this poet 
The gas in his stomach — rather, 
wrapped around his stomach — was 
hissing into the room. The gas erupt- 
ed into a purple cloud, spreading out- 
ward faster than any gas Sloane had 
ever seen. 

“Dorrie!” Sloane screamed. He 
brought his hand up for his gun, but 
his lungs were burning. His mind 
spun. He felt himself numbing. 

Gamboge, sienna, cobalt, soot, 
rouge, said the pheasant’s feathers. 

Dorrie floated toward the ceiling, 
away from the rapidly expanding 
fumes. But the clouds were pushing 
up and up, faster all the time. 

Waltham had a miniature breather 
between his teeth, sucking on the de- 
gassed air it gave him. His belly was 
almost gone^' 

Sloane’s hand was fastened to his 
chest with bolts. He could not begin 
to lift the gun. He saw Waltham draw 
his own pistol, and he saw everyone 
on the floor from the gas — guards 
included. He tried to fight it, found 
it was useless. 

Waltham aimed toward the ceil- 
ing, fired. 

Dorrie lurched, wavered, drifted 
downwards. 

Wahkam fired again. 

Dorrie fell — and bled. 



Sloane choked, found he could no 
longer swallow, blinked, and was 
gone into a silent heap on the floor. 

XU 

S loane came to after the sky had 
fallen on him, his head aching. 
The rest were still out — all but 
Dorrie. The door to the cage stood 
open, the guard’s keys discarded on 
the floor. 

Waltham. 

Why the hell, Waltham? he 
thought. 

He crawled across the floor to the 
blood-covered lump that was Dorrie 
Penevitch. He was still alive. The 
blue eyes were a bit hazy, but they 
focused easily enough on Sloane. 

“Hey,” Dorrie choked, “who 
would have thought, huh?” He 
coughed blood, dribbling it through 
his normal lips. 

“I’ll get a doctor, Dorrie.” 

“No. No that won’t matter. Hell, 
I’m so smashed up that no one could 
piec^ this humpty-dumpty together 
again.” 

“Don’t get mor — ” 

“It’s true. You should go after 
him.” 

“I will.” Sloane started to stand. 
“And listen, Dorrie, if I get him. I’ll 
bring the bird back first thing. You 
can hold it.” 

Coughing of blood. “No that 
wouldn’t be good. I don’t need no 
goddamn bird now. That’s not a good 
idea at all.” 

“Just the same — ” 

“No. Now get him! That’s an or-

the blue eyes closed and the long, 
two-elbowed arm jerked twice, spas- 
modically. 

Sloane bent down again. “Dorrie.

H e stood and slammed the alarm 
lever the paralyzed guards had 
not been able to reach. Then he 
caught sight of the open door and 
the empty shaft of the service eleva- 
tor. He called it back, rode it quickly 
to the reserve above. When he step- 
ped out, he saw the footprints leading 
away in the damp earth. 

Staggering, his mind swept along in 
currents he was not sure of, he fol- 
lowed them. Ever since his contact 
with the Nightmare Rat, his mind 
had been wavering on the brink of 
realization. Thoughts of the pheas- 
ant started some secret line of mem- 
ory he knew he was keeping from 
himself. The mystery of the dream 
was complicating itself. He wanted 
out. 

The large-leafed tree brushed him 
as the trail narrowed. Somewhere in 
the miles of reserve, a rendezvous 
point had been arranged for Wal- 
tham. Another illegal flight would 
pick up one poet, one Pheasant of 
Dreams. 

He just had to beat Waltham to 
the meeting place. Rounding a bend, 
he was confronted by the poet. The 
pheasant in one hand, Waltham yell- 
ed “Catch” and tossed something 
brown and furry toward Sloane. He 
brought up his gun, fired a shot that 
missed, looked down at the puppy- 
like animal that clung to his shiit, 
mewing. 

Darkness. 



T he hills were lovely — green 
trees, the tangle of underbrush. 
He could hear the trilling of birds Uke 
thin, sweet flutes. Crickets sang. Dan^ 
delions had turned to puff. 

^*Allie,** a soft voice said from be^ 
hind . 

He turned, looked. She was six- 
teen, going on seventeen. She had 
long, sunshine hair. Blue eyes. She 
was blessed with an up-turned nose 
above rosepetal lips . 

She had an adolescent body . 
Small, jutting breasts, smooth legs. 

She wore the conservative clothes 
the orphanage women chose for her. 
When she was old enough and be- 
came an agent, she would wear other 
clothes not as bulky or as long. But she 
would hate and be ashamed of those. 

**Corridor Mother Amy gave us 
two free hours,** she said. 

** Corridor Father Avram is gone 
for the day and has excused us from 
lessons,** he said. 

He forced himself to look into her 
eyes. There was something strange 
there. In the eternity of blue there 
floated a mote that was searching for 
a way out. He looked closer — then 
suddenly realizing that she knew he 
was staring, turned away. 

“7 have something for you to see 
in the woods, Allie. But first you 
must promise never to tell any of the 
Fathers or Mothers.** 

'*Okay,** he said. 

The wind blew cool in his face. 
They climbed a small knoll behind 
the house and disappeared over the 
rim into a shaded valley. Under the 
canopy of leaves, there was little 
light. She pointed to a thatching of 
branches, a lean-to against the cliff.

''There is a small cave behind it J* 

She took his hand and led him be- 
hind the cover. They came into the 
center of the cave. It was delicately 
lighted by a waterworn hole in the 
ceiling. 

**You won't tell them?'* She was 
shaking. 

He was disappointed in finding so 
small a secret. *'No. Of course not." 
He turned to leave. 

**Wait, Allie. There's more. Seat 
yourself. I'll be back in .. soon . " 

He examined the fern mats, the 
grass chairs. And when she came back 
in, she was naked. And she threw her- 
self upon him, sobbing. She told him 
what she had planned to do and that 
she was now too ashamed to do it. 
At first he was paralyzed. But warmth 
came to him, and he put his lips 
against her cheek — 

But the thatched cover was sud- 
denly thrust aside. Ankle-length dress- 
es were silhouetted there. 

Corridor Mother Amy lifted the 
heavy stick, brought it down over 
Alicia's bare back. She breathed hard. 
And when Alicia bled, she breathed 
even harder. 

They saved him for the Psycha- 
Preacher who had tubes for organs, 
sensor grids for eyes, and impersonal 
hypno-tapes for a voice. They put 
him inside its stomach and told it to 
teach him a lesson. 

*'l have come for absolution," 
he said to it. 

I WILL HAVE YOU THREE 
HOURS, SLOANE. YOU WILL BE 
IN ME THREE HOURS. THIS IS 
YOUR SIXTH TIME IN ABSOLU- 
TION. YOU CANNOT SEEM 
TO LEARN. THIS TIME YOU 



WILL LEARN WITH GREAT 
PAIN. 

*T understand." 

YOU MUST GROW UP TO 
HAVE A SINGLENESS OF PUR- 
POSE. THERE MUST BE NOTH- 
ING TO DISTURB YOUR FUNC- 
TION AS AN AGENT. YOU 
MUST BE A GOOD SMAICER. 

*'Please. It hurts." 

Lead poured through his brain 
cells. 

IT WILL HURT EVEN MORE. 
YOU MUST LEARN, SLOANE. 
YOU WILL NOT REMEMBER 
THAT FILTHY SLUT AND 
WHAT SHE TRIED TO DO TO 
YOU, HOW SHE TRIED TO 
SPOIL YOU. WE WILL MAKE 
THE MEMORY TOO PAINFUL 
FOR YOU TO EVEN WANT TO 
RETAIN. NOW, WHAT DID SHE 
LOOK LIKE LAST? 

*Tt hurtsF* 

WHAT DID SHE LOOK LIKE, 
SLOANE! 

**She had blood on her face!" 

e had blood on his face. 

The Nightmare Rat was dead. 
He had its blood all over him, and 
it might have been that which made 
remember the dream. He dropped the 
corpse, his hands sticky. Every frag- 
ment of the dream roiled in his mind. 
He had forgotten Alicia and what 
they had done to her — rather, the 
memory had been driven into the 
depths of his mind. 

His legs were trembling, his knees 
like so much jelly. He forced himself 
completely erect, however, and drew 
in great lungfuls of air. 

Tears stung the flesh of his cheeks.

The memory of that day was now 
making up for all the time it had been 
denied possession of his conscious 
mind. It was re-lived and re-lived like 
a film loop.

stumbled into the brush after Wal- 
them. But foremost of all, he ran after 
the pheasant. He ran faster than he 
knew he could run, his legs flashing 
up and down like pistons, plunging 
him along the trail. 

Eventually, croaking, weeping, 
gasping, for air, he came to the edge 
of the clearing where Waltham sat,

his arms, went to the poet. “Why you, 
Waltham?” 

“I’ve had aU the other drugs, the 
Nightmare Rat, everything. He was 
going to share it with me. He would 
hide me and share the bird.” 

“Not a man like Briscow.” 

But Waltham was dead. Sloane 
dragged the body away into the bush- 
es, returned to the clearing as the ro- 
bot-driven craft descended from the

him. 



W hen the craft settled, he board-

in with the pheasant in his arms, 
for the trip to the Briscow satellite 
to end. When the craft loqked into 
the docking area of the pleasure plat- 
form and the indicators showed full 
atmosphere in the chamber outside, 
he leap^ through the portal onto the 
gangway. 

A near-corpse in a wheelchair 
looked at him, its slitted eyes grow- 
ing wider with surprise. “Who are 
you? Where’s Waltham? Who are 
you?” 

He gunned down the guard behind 
the ragman. 

“Who? Please, who?” 

If / only knew, Sloane thought, 
Vd tell you. 

He pounded down the gangway to 
the space yacht docked at the other 
end, electronically moored to the plat- 
form. 

“The pheasant!” the corpse scream- 
ed. 

He clutched the bird tighter. It 
sighed. 

Plunging through the open portal 
of the giant ship, he blasted the main- 



tenance man, climbed the stairs to the 
control room. After the outer doors 
were closed, he flipped on the starter 
engines. He was disitantly aware that, 
in the enclosed space, Briscow would 
be fried, reduced to nothing but ash- 
es by the blast. But he did not care 
about Briscow. 

He had a yacht with food lockers 
and water tanks. There were air-pro- 
ducing gardens. He could last at 
least seven years in deepspace. Which 
wasn’t long. But which was, he knew 
as he clutched the bird to himself, 
much more of a life than he had ever 
known before. 

Behind him, the sparkling of a 
once-satdlite belonging to a once- 
living corpse lit the blackness for a 
moment in white splendor, then was 
gone. 

He could make his thirty-two years 
better than Briscow’s three hundred. 
He knew he could. He prayed to God 
and the Devil that he could. 

Someone had stolen the Pheasant 
of Dreams. 

The Dreaming Pheasant.

IF * Short Story 



LIKE BANQUO'S GHOST 

by LARRY NIVEN 



They sent the Snarkhunfer probe to far 
Cenfaurus. But some snarks are boojumsl 



a hot, lovely fall day I drove 
out to Stardrive Laboratories. 
If all went well, that was the day 
the Snarkhunter No. 3 probe would 
send its final message from Alpha 
Centauri. The Times had assigned 
me to cover the event. 

There were coffee and rolls in 
the anteroom. A diverse lot milled 
about and introduced each other 
and shook hands and talked. Pret- 
ty secretaries moved briskly through 
the crowd. I recognized people I’d 
talked to when I was here two 
months ago, and one man I knew 
only from his picture. Jubal Hen- 
dricks, Senior, had managed Star- 
drive Labs thirty years ago, when 
Snarkhunter No. 3 was launched. 
He’d retired just afterward, but 



here he was, emaciated and totter- 
ing, to watch his project’s end. 

I headed for the coffee table. 
The man everyone called Butch 
saw me coming and waited while I 
drew a cup. He was five feet tall, 
the color of mahogany, his bright 
blond hair cropped short in a butch 
”How good to see you again, l\Ir. 
Lane I” He pumped my hand with 
enthusiasm. ^^You do rememl)cr 
me?” 

”Of course. Butch, very well in- 
deed.” I didn’t remember his full 
name, but then, nobody did. And 
nobody else seemed to want to talk 
to him. '^How have you been?” 
”Very well, Mr. Lane, despite 
my allergies. I have been taking 
shots.” 



155 . 




”They seem to help,” I said. Last 
time I’d seen him his nose had 
dripped constantly. ''Your accent 
has improved too.” 

He laughed self-consciously. 'Ht 
is nearly eight o’clock. Shall we 
move into the — ” His tongue 
stumbled, and he had to point. 
^^The auditorium? Yes, let’s.” 
Two months ago we’d been here 
to catch the first signals from the 
Snarkhunter No. 3 probe as it en- 
tered the vicinity of Alpha Cen- 
tauri. Hie probe had been flying 
before I was born, but that had 
been its first message since leaving 
the solar system. On that occasion it 
had switched itself on right on 
schedule, then given us the sizes 
and locations of the Centaurus plan- 
ets. 

The speed of light barred us from 
controlling the Snarkhunter from 
Earth. The probe had been pro- 
grammed to (ioose the planets most 
likely to be Earthlike, and to home 
on it. We had named that planet 
Centaura, even before we knew it 
existed — thirty years ago, when it 
was known only that the Centauri 
suns had planets. 

Centaura did exist; we knew that 
now. For the last two months the 
Snarkhunter should have been mov- 
ing toward it. 

'^he auditorium hadn’t changed 
much in that time. Stardrive 
Labs used the same building for all 
its publicity on all the probes it 



currently had flying; but none of 
those probes had done an 3 dhing 
interesting since the Snarkhunter’s 
last report. There were seventy 
chairs, with ash trays fixed to the 
backs, set up to face a lighted 
screen. The screen showed a plot 
of the Snarkhunter’s presumed posi- 
tion with respect to the planet 
Centaura. Arrows pointed in the 
directions of Earth and Alpha Cen- 
tauri A. Naturally the plot was four 
point three years out of date, due 
to light lag. Hanging from the ceil- 
ing were eight TV screens, each 
presently showing a diagram of the 
Alpha Centauri A system. In one 
corner of the big room was a blank 
sphere eight feet across, with a 
clear plastic hyperbola mounted 
near it. That was new. 

Butch pointed. ”The curve is the 
projected course of the Snarkhunt- 
er. Mr. Hendricks Junior tells me 
they will draw continents on the 
sphere as the data arrives.” 

^'Naturally,” I said. We found 
seats. I manfully resisted the urge 
to smoke, that being one of Butch’s 
allergies. 

Time stopped. 

I took my coffee in gulps. I’d 
been up at six o’clock, for the 
first time in years. My eyes felt 
gummy; my mouth was centuries 

old. 

Most of the seats were empty. 
Even under the circumstances, the 
lack of excitement was remarkable. 
On screen were a blank circle and 



156 



IF 




a h5rperbola, a couple of arrows, and 
a little rectangle showing the time 
remaining until perihelion. The rec- 
tangle changed every five minutes, 
and a new point appeared on the 
hyperbola, showing the new position 
of the Snarkhunter instrument pack- 
age. 

From time to time a blurred ra- 
dio voice echoed in the auditorium. 

'T am amazed,” Butch said fer- 
vently. ''To think that it has come 
so far! Do you think it will ful- 
fill its purpose?” 

"As you say, it’s come this far.” 
"I cannot understand why there 
is so little excitement.” 

He couldn’t, could he? "It’s part- 
ly the time lag,” I said. "Who can 
get excited about old news?” 

"I suppose so. Still, so much 
hinges on the success of the pro- 
ject.” 

"My cup’s empty. Can I get you 
some coffee?” 

"Oh, no. No, thank you.” 

I went out and filled my cup, 
then stayed in the anteroom to 
smoke a cigarette. Things were hap- 
pening too slowly. Thirty years the 
probe had been on its way, but the 
hours it needed to roimd Centaura 
were far too long. Maybe Butch 
was getting on my nerves. 

Not his fault, of course. He was 
unfailingly poUte. You couldn’t 
quarrel with his enthusiasm; it was 
genuine. It only seemed a mockery. 
And I had to stick with him. 
Butch’s reactions were bigger news 



by far than the Snarkhunter it- 
self. - 

I spent ten minutes by the cof- 
fee dispenser, waiting for interview- 
ees. It was the one sure place to 
find anyone you wanted to see. I 
caught Hendricks Senior and Hen- 
dricks Junior, Markham, who bad 
laimched the Snarkhtmter, and Du- 
ryohana, who ran the project now, 
and several others. 

Butch couldn’t stand coffee. 
What had he been doing out here 
by the coffee dispenser? 

Just what I was doing, of course. 
Waiting for people to speak to 
him. And nobody wanted to. 

T was heading for my seat when 
the radio cleared its throat. 

"We are receiving the carrier 
wave from Snarkhunter. Snark- 
hunter has located Sol and is trans- 
mitting correctly. Repeat, location 
successful. We are now receiving 
Snarkhunter.” 

The air was full of a two-tone 
musical note, the sound of the car- 
rier wave, low and sweet. 

Butch was hugging his knees in 
delight. " Wonderful 1 What is it 
telling them? Why doesn’t he say?” 

The Snarkhunter isn’t sa3dng 
anything,” I told him. I’d gotten 
that information from my inter- 
views. "It’s just a locator wave to 
alert us.” 

"What kind of wave is the probe 
using?” 

"A light beam, a ruby laser. 



LIKE BANQUO'S GHOST 



157 




Hear that musical tone? That’s 
the laser, translated into sound and 
then stepped down to the audible 
range.” 

The point on the screen moved 
another notch. Ten minutes to peri- 
helion. 

The radio voice said, ^'We have 
received our first burst of data from 
Snarkhunter. Composition of Cen- 
taura’s atmosphere is as follows. 
Oxygen sixteen percent, nitrogen 
eighty-three percent ...” It con- 
tinued detailing carbon dioxide, no- 
ble gases, water vapor, ozone, sur- 
face pressure, and the planet’s sur- 
face temperature and magnetic 
field. Butch hugged his knees and 
made sounds of pleasure. 

Marvelous!” he crowed. '^Mar- 
velous! From such a distance! How 
sensitive, how versatile the instru- 
ments!” 

"To me it all seems anticlimac- 
tic.” 

"I fear that is my own fault. 
I am sorry.” 

The radio saved me from having 
to answer. "Decoding of Snarkhunt- 
er’s transmission is now in pro- 
gress. In a few minutes we should 
have a rough map of Centaura’s 
surface.” It added, "Snarkhunter 
is about to pass behind the planet. 
It will reach perihelion three min- 
utes later.” 

The auditorium became silent. 
I made a shushing motion at Butch. 
We heard only the musical sound of 
the carrier wave. 



he sound cut off abruptly. 

"It will not reappear,” Butch 
said sadly. 

"That’s a pity. It was program- 
med to take another set of measure- 
ments at perihelion. They would 
have been a little more accurate.” 

The point on the screen moved a 
notch, to its point of closest ap- 
proach to Centaura. 

"Is that where you shot it 
down?” 

"Yes, at perihelion,” said Butch. 
"How were we to know it was not 
hostile? We would not have be- 
lieved it was possible at all. An in- 
strument package, with no external 
guidance, finding its way over such 
a distance!” He stood up. "A re- 
markable achievement! Remark- 
able! To have done so much with 
so little!” 

"Thanks,” I said. Thanks for the 
pat on the head. "Then you’ll go 
ahead with the trade?” 

"I will have to wait,” said 
Butch, "to see if your map of our 
world is accurate. Thus far your 
measurements have been excellent. 
Unbelievably so! If your map is as 
good, we have a bargain. We will 
trade you our faster-than-light drive 
for your incredible probes. Together 
we will explore space!” 

"Fine.” I had what I came for; 
I rose to leave. 

"It has been a lonely year,” said 
Butch. "I do not think I knew 
why until now. Mr. Lane, please 
don’t be offended. Did my landing

gard their own technology as inferi-

course. Why wouldn’t it? 
Our lousy little probe took thirty 
years to reach Centaura. Your ship 
took six months! And here you are, 
like the ghost at theHaanquet. Oh, 
damn. I’m sorry, Butch. I lost my 
head.” 

''And so you all tend to avoid 
me. But my own people felt the 



same way, when your probe reached 
us four point three years ago. Our 
faster-than-light drive was a single 
lucky discovery. Your probe was 
the combined result of centuries of 
single-minded, terribly expensive la- 
bor and experimentation. We are 
awed. We are not capable of such 
sustained effort. But you cannot 
believe that, can you?” 

I couldn’t. And I can’t.

HUE/ 
CRY! 



Dear Editor: 

In If you attempt to justify tra- 
ditional sf. That’s all very fair. But 
I feel that the British New Wave, 
w<hieh in the same breath you seem 
to condemn, should be given the 
same chance. 

Tradition is a mechanism which 
operates on, and influences, aU as- 
pects of cultural life today. It is the 
call from the grave, the influence of 
the past upon the present. 

There is no word as yet for its 
antithesis — prospection is as good 
as any — but the new wave sf writ- 
ers believe it to be an equally valid 
mechanism, definable, in the same 
metaphorical terms used above, as 
the call of the unborn generations, 
the influence, upon the present, of 
the future. 

They maintain, irrefutably, that 
the elements by which we judge and 
gauge the future are no less tangi- 
ble than those ‘‘traditional” elements 
by which we judge and gauge the 
past — this pen I hold in my hand 
today, I held in my hand yesterday 
and will hold in my hand tomorrow; 
I live with yesterday, but I live for 
tomorrow; while I have no memories 
of the future, I have prophetic vision 
and hopes that can create the fact. 

It is the nature of the prospective 
mechanism — which utilizes these 
elements — that the new wave sf 



writers are currently concerned with 
probing. 

When you tried to justify tra- 
ditional sf you must have realized 
that for many people it would need 
no justification. Perhaps the same is 
true of new wave sf. — Graham 
Charnock, 2 Warlsingham Mansions, 
Fulhan Road, London SW6, Eng- 
land. 

• We agree there’s room for all 
kinds of sf. We object only when 
new wavers (or any other specialized 
types) tell us their kind of sf is the 
only one that’s any good, and every- 
thing else is trash — Editor. 

Dear Editor: 

Consider the planet Jupiter. It 
has been guesstimated that under 
its tortured atmosphere there is a 
li(#uid “hydrosphere” (or should it 
be “methammoniosphere”?) about 
17,000 miles deep, surrounding a 
solid core. Maybe the liquid merges 
imperceptibly into solid at those 
pressures; or maybe there is a defi- 
nite demarcation. If this were so, 
then the pressure of the liquid all 
around would defy the imagination. 
The solid core might, take the form 
requiring the least surface area, and 
become a fairly good approximation 
of a sphere. 

And then, what would happen if 
life were to evolve at the bottom of 



160 




the ocean? The complex material 
composing the living organism 
would be almost completely two-di- 
mentionaJ. Perhaps the whole of the 
face of the organism would be bath- 
ed in life-supporting fluids, if they 
were still even vaguely fluid at that 
depth; or maybe it would have to 
absorb everything along the plane 
of its universe. 

What conception of a universe 
would such organisms have? What 
gods would they worship? And how 
would they react to a solid-state 
space probe from another planet? 
(Maybe Earth, and then again, 
maybe not.) If the fluid surrounding 
the solid had a high mutual cohesion, 
then the smallest space between the 
organism and its environment would 
cause it to be sucked off and whisk- 
ed up into the three-dimensional 
world. What would the natives make 
of this? Would they take it as a 
Sign? And would the unfortunate 
creature be killed instantly, or if 
not, what would be its experience? 

That is the basis of my idea. It is 
not properly developed, but then I 
won’t be writing it. 

I am looking forward to another 
Berserker story from Fred Saber- 
hagen. Being fairly new to SF I 
don’t know if that was the first of 
his stories on that theme, but it was 
marvelous. As ah example of poetic 
justice — even to the naming of the 
squash fruit — it stands on a pin- 
nacle. — M. J. Farrell, 17, Garnett 
Street, Huntingdale, East Oakleigh 
3166, Melbourne, Australia. 

• Thanks, Mr. Farrell. How about 
you other fellows? We invited you 
some time ago to tell us about sci- 
ence-fiction stories you would like to 
see someone write. We’ll publish the 
most interesting ones here — then 
it’s up to the "writers to make stories 
out of them! — Editor, 



Dear Editor: 

I’ll come right to the point. I’m 
a long-time “astro-nut” who gob- 
bles voraciously everything I can get 
my hands on about space and what 
is or may be out there, factual and 
fictional alike. Now I’ve run into a 
sort of astronomical-SF mystery 
and I was wondering if you have an 
idea of an explanation. 

The question is: What is it about 
Altair that makes writers persist- 
ently provide it with planets, and 
inhabited ones at that? Here it is, a 
beautiful, bright, white-hot A6-type 
speed demon of a star that simply 
rotates much too fast to permit 
maintenance of a planetary system 
in a stable orbit. It’s just a kid as 
stars go, and it has a long way ahead 
of it before it gets to the stalge 
where it’ll get rid of its excess mo- 
mentum, let alone planets. That is, 
if it doesn’t burn itself out first. 
Furthermore, no perturbations have 
been detected in its motion, so it’s a 
cinch it’s all alone out there. 

Now. I have run into any number 
of stories where the action takes 
place on a planet of Altair. You 
probably remember the movie. For- 
bidden Planet — locale, Altair IV. 
And on my favorite TV show. Star 
Trek (remember your dire predic- 
tion that it wouldn't «tay? You were 
wrong, and I know you’re as glad 
as I am that it’s back) — .yup, there 
it was, Altair with planets, and 
guess who wrote the script? Theo- 
dore Sturgeon. 

Now in this case it may have 
been a matter of convenience, be- 
cause the story hinged on First Of- 
ficer Spock and the necessity of his 
getting home to his lown planet, Vul- 
can. planet of the pointed ears 
is, if I remember correctly, in orbit 
about Component A of the Eridani 
system . which is maybe .3 of a

liglit-year away from Altalr, prac- 
tically on top of it as neig^hboring 
stars go. So it would be exi>edient, 
wouldn't it?, to have the USS En~ 
terprise bound for official business 
on Altair VI when the emergency 
arises. 

But it disturbed me. 

So — what's Altair got that 
makes writers ignore the facts and 
give it planets? — (Miss) Zita Car- 
no, 2020 Creston Avenue, Bronx, 
New York 10453. 

• Sure, we can answer that. Look 
at the other named stars authors 
might use — Betelgeuse, Ras Al- 
hague, Pulcherrima, Zuben el Genu- 
bi and even worse. Altair may not 
be inhabitable. But it's pronounoa- 
blel — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I'd send this note to Arthur C. 
Clarke, but I have no idea how to 
reach him, so I'll have to ask you to 
relay the gist of it when you find 
the time. 

I'm afraid that the same Leslie A. 
Gritten who called Clarke's atten- 
tion to his having apparently misre- 
membered the author of “The Antici- 
pator" (Guest Editorial, ZF, 12/67) 
has misremembered some bibliophilic 
data of his own. 

Alas — Mr, Gritten couldnH 
“clearly recall"* the serialization of 
Wells's “The War of the Worlds” in 
The Strand Magaziney as Clarke 
says he does. “The War” wasn't 
serialized there at all, but in the 
rival and imitative English popular > 
magazine of the time, Pear$on*8, 
from April, 1897 (in the sa;me issue 
which saw -the conclusion of Kip- 
ling's Captains Courageous) to De- 
cember, 1897. 

Two Morley Roberts stories were 
published by Pea/rson*s during the 
run of “The War” — “The Onder- 
donk,” in June, 1897, and “The 



Keeper of Waters,” in September, 
18-97. Neither is fantasy, nor is 
either at all unusual in plot or style. 
(Gratuitous info, this.) 

I imagine the Wells novel Mr, 
Gritten recalls in connection with 
The Strand is the only one of the 
early fantastic novels the former 
wrote to appear in that magazine: 
“The First Men in the Moon,” which 
ran from November, 1900 to August, 
1901 (the same issue which opened 
with the first installment of “The 
Hound of the Baskervilles”) . 

All of which probably constitutes 
a good deal more data on Wells's 
novels, English popular magazines, 
and incidental Morley Roberts short 
stories -than you, Clarke, and prob- 
ably Mr. Gritten care for. But some 
of it may be of passing interest, and 
the correction seemed worth making. 

Galaxy and If continue on a high 
level of excellence — at least in 
their longer fiction, and I was tick- 
led with the line-up of Hugo win- 
ners this time (if baffled by Niven's 
award). 

Apropos of the current If and the 
/author of its lead novelette: is it 
true, as rumors have it, that C. C. 
MacApp conceals the cognomen of 
Calvin Coolidge beneath those cool, 
crisp initials? — Bill Blackboard, 
2077 Golden Gate Avenue, San Fran- 
cisco 94115, California. 

• No, actually one C stands for 
“Carroll”, the other for “classified 
information,” 

And now for some information 
that isn't classified: next month we 
will he bringing you the long- 
awaited new Van Vogt story, “The 
Proxy Int^gence.” It is a com- 
plete short novel and is guaranteed 
to please all Van Voigt fans. Don't 
miss this exciting story — or any 
of the others in the October IP. 
We'll see you next month. — Editor.
