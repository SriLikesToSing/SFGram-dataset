THEY’RE BACK 



COME time ago, this depart- 
O ment, proving There Are 
Aliens Among us, warned that we 
might be conquered with such in- 
vasion weapons as paper clips and 
rubber bands, provided clues by 
which these uninvited guests might 
be identified. 

Readers have asked for more 
data, were reassured when none 
was available. Far from joining 
them, I found the sudden quiet 
alarming; the aliens obviously had 
gone into hiding. But now they 
are emerging again and no more 
able, even after their long seclu- 
sion, to stop betraying their alien- 
ness than before. 

Arthur F. Ackley sent in this 
clipping from the Schenectady 
Union Star: “last Tuesday. Air 
Force technicians estiy Maj. David 
Simons on his balloon flight when 
this view was made including 
stomated his altitude at more than 
50,000 feet reported seeing spec- 
tacular storm. Imagrm clouds in 
center. Simons at one point face of 
balloe at upper right was reflection 
from sur-This picture was made 
on infra-red film bon’s gondola.” 

Mr. Ackley reports that picture 
and caption appeared in his copy 
of the paper; not in others. He 
asks if they are trying to commu- 



nicate with him and adds that he 
is particularly interested in the 
imagrm clouds in center. Running 
this item may answer both ques- 
tions. Let us know what happens, 
Mr. Ackley, if you’re in any posi- 
tion to. 

Theodore Cogswell, who teaches 
at the U. of Kentucky, says: 
“THEY are taking over our uni- 
versities! For a long time, I 
thought it was me. A stack of fresh- 
men themes would come in and 
as I started through them I kept 
having the feeling I’d read them 
before. This was complicated by 
a feeling as I walked into classes 
at the beginning of the semester 
that I had seen the students before. 
To this add that most of my sec- 
ond semester students seemed to 
have no memory of anything that 
was discussed during the first 
semester. 

“There is only one explanation: 
THEY have obtained matrixes of 
50 average freshmen types and are 
sending them to Earth by thou- 
sands for one semester orientation 
periods, each equipped with a sur- 
vival kit containing 16 freshmen 
themes. 

“Flunking them out doesn’t help 
since the grade isn’t given until

who also bears my first name, but 
I have a rough-and-ready charm of 
my own. I need it, for my job is 
to nurse back to health and kid 
back to sanity Soldiers badly 
roughed up in the biggest war go- 
ing. This war is the Change War, 
a war of time travelers— in fact, our 
private name for being in this war 
is being on the Big Time. Our 
Soldiers fight by going back to 
change the past, or even ahead to 
change the future, in ways to help 
our side win the final victory a 
billion or more years from now. 
A long killing business, believe 
me. 

You don’t know about the 
Change War, but it’s influencing 
your lives all the time and maybe 
you’ve had hints of it without 
realizing. 

Have you ever worried about 
your memory, because it doesn’t 
seem to be bringing you exactly 
the same picture of the past from 
one day to the next? Have you 
ever been afraid that your per- 
sonality was changing because of 
forces beyond your knowledge or 
control? Have you ever felt sure 
that sudden death was about to 
jump you from nowhere? Have 
you ever been scared of Ghosts— 
not the story-book kind, but the 
billions of beings who were once 
so real and strong it’s hard to be- 
lieve they’ll just sleep harmlessly 
forever? Have you ever wondered 
about those things you may call 



devils or Demons— spirits able to 
range through all time and space, 
through the hot hearts of stars 
and the cold skeleton of space be- 
tween the galaxies? Have you ever 
thought that the whole universe 
might be a crazy, mixed-up dream? 
If you have, you’ve had hints of 
the Change War. 

How I got recruited into the 
Change War, how it’s conducted, 
what the two sides are, why you 
don’t consciously know about it, 
what I really think about it— you’ll 
learn in due course. 

HPHE place outside the cosmos 
where I and my pals do our 
nursing job I simply call the Place. 
A lot of my nursing consists of 
amusing and humanizing Soldiers 
fresh back from raids into time. 
In fact, my formal title is En- 
tertainer and I’ve got my silly 
side, as you’ll find out. 

My pals are two other gals and 
three guys from quite an assort- 
ment of times and places. We’re 
a pretty good team, and with Sid 
bossing, we run a pretty good Re- 
cuperation Station, though we have 
our family troubles. But most of 
our troubles come slamming into 
the Place with the beat-up Sol- 
diers, who’ve generally just been 
going through hell and want to 
raise some of their own. As a mat- 
ter of fact, it was three newly ar- 
rived Soldiers who started this 
thing I’m going to tell you about,

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




this thing that showed me so much 
about myself and everything. 

When it started, I had been on 
the Big Time for a thousand sleeps 
and two thousand nightmares, and 
working in the Place for five hun- 
dred-one thousand. This two-night- 
mares routine every time you lay 
down your dizzy little head is 
rough, but you pretend to get used 
to it because being on the Big 
Time is supposed to be worth it. 

The Place is midway in size 
and atmosphere between a large 
nightclub where the Entertainers 
sleep in and a small Zeppelin han- 
gar decorated for a party, though 
a Zeppelin is one thing we haven’t 
had yet. You go out of the Place, 
but not often if you have any sense 
and if you are an Entertainer like 
me, into the cold light of a morning 
filled with anything from the 
earlier dinosaurs to the later space- 
men, who look strangely similar 
except for size. 

Solely on doctor’s orders, I have 
been on cosmic leave six times 
since coming to work at the Place, 
meaning I have had six brief va- 
cations, if you care to call them 
that, for believe me they are bus- 
man’s holidays, considering what 
goes on in the Place all the time. 
The last one I spent in Renais- 
sance Rome, where I got a crush 
on Cesare Borgia, but I got over 
it. Vacations are for the birds, any- 
way, because they have to be fitted 
by the Spiders into serious opera- 



tions of the Change War, and you 
can imagine how restful that 
makes them. 

“See those Soldiers changing the 
past? You stick along with them. 
Don’t go too far up front, though, 
but don’t wander off either. Relax 
and enjoy yourself.” 

Ha! Now the kind of recupera- 
tion Soldiers get when they come 
to the Place is a horse of a far 
brighter color, simply dazzling by 
comparison. Entertainment is our 
business and we give them a bang- 
up time and send them staggering 
happily back into action, though 
once in a great while something 
may happen to throw a wee 
shadow on the party. 

T AM dead in some ways, but 
don’t let that bother you— I 
am lively enough in others. If you 
met me in the cosmos, you would 
be more apt to yak with me or try 
to pick me up than to ask a cop 
to do same or a father to douse 
me with holy water, unless you 
are one of those hard-boiled re- 
former types. But you are not like- 
ly to meet me in the cosmos, be- 
cause (bar Basin Street and the 
Prater) 15th Century Italy and 
Augustan Rome— until they spoiled 
it — are my favorite (Ha!) vaca- 
tion spots and, as I have said, I 
stick as close to the Place as I can. 
It is really the nicest Place in the 
whole Change World. (Crisis! I 
even think of it capitalized!) 



THE BIG TIME 



9 




Anyhoo, when this thing started, 
I was twiddling my thumbs on 
the couch nearest the piano and 
thinking it was too late to do my 
fingernails and whoever came in 
probably wouldn’t notice them any- 
way. 

The Place was jumpy like it 
always is on an approach and the 
gray velvet of the Void around 
us was curdled with the uneasy 
lights you see when you close your 
eyes in the dark. 

Sid was tuning the Maintained 
for the pickup and the right shoul- 
der of his gold-worked gray doublet 
was streaked where he’d been wip- 
ing his face on it with quick ducks 
of his head. 

Beauregard was leaning as close 
as he could over Sid’s other shoul- 
der, one white-trousered knee 
neatly indenting the rose plush of 
the control divan, and he wasn’t 
missing a single flicker of Sid’s old 
fingers on the dials; Beau’s co-pilot 
besides piano player. Beau’s face 
had that dead blank look it must 
have had when every double eagle 
he owned and more he didn’t were 
riding on the next card to be 
turned in the gambling saloon on 
one of those wedding-cake Missis- 
sippi steamboats. 

Doc was soused as usual, sitting 
at the bar with his top hat pushed 
back and his knitted shawl pulled 
around him, his wide eyes seeing 
whatever horrors a life in Nazi- 
occupied Czarist Russia can add 



to being a drunk Demon in the 
Change World. 

Maud, who is the Old Girl, and 
Lili — the New Girl, of course — 
were telling the big beads of their 
identical pearl necklaces. 

You might say that all us En- 
tertainers were a bit edgy; being 
Demons doesn’t automatically 
make us brave. 

Then the red telltale on the 
Major Maintainer went out and 
the Door began to darken in the 
Void facing Sid and Beau, and 
I felt Change Winds blowing hard 
and my heart missed a couple of 
beats, and the next thing three 
Soldiers had stepped out of the 
cosmos and into the Place, their 
first three steps hitting the floor 
hard as they changed times and 
weights. 

r T'HEY were dressed as officers 
of hussars, as we’d been advised, 
and — praise the Bonny Dew! — I 
saw that the first of them was 
Erich, my own dear little comman- 
dant, the pride of the von Hohen- 
walds and the Terror of the 
Snakes. Behind him was some 
hard-faced Roman or other, and 
beside Erich and shouldering into 
him as they stamped forward was 
a new boy, blond, with a face like 
a Greek god who’s just been tour- 
ing a Christian hell. 

They were uniformed exactly 
alike in black — shakos, fur-edged 
pelisses, boots, and so forth— with 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




white skull emblems on the shakos. 
The only difference between them 
was that Erich had a Caller on his 
wrist and the New Boy had a 
black-gauntleted glove on his left 
hand and was clenching the mate 
in it, his right hand being bare like 
both of Erich’s and the Roman’s. 

“You’ve made it, lads, hearts of 
gold,” Sid boomed at them, and 
Beau twitched a smile and mur- 
mured something courtly and 
Maud began to chant, “Shut the 
Door!” and the New Girl copied 
her and I joined in because the 
Change Winds do blow like crazy 
when the Door is open, even 
though it can’t ever be shut tight 
enough to keep them from leaking 
through. 

“Shut it before it blows wrinkles 
in our faces,” Maud called in her 
gamin voice to break the ice, look- 
ing like a skinny teen-ager in the 
tight, knee-length frock she’d 
copied from the New Girl. 

But the three Soldiers weren’t 
paying attention. The Roman — 
I remembered his name was Mark 
— was blundering forward stiffly 
as if there were something wrong 
with his eyes, while Erich and the 
New Boy were yelling at each 
other about a kid and Einstein and 
a summer palace and a bloody 
glove and the Snakes having 
booby-trapped Saint Petersburg. 
Erich had that taut sadistic smile 
he gets when he wants to hit me. 

The New Boy was in a tearing 



rage. “Why’d you pull us out so 
bloody fast? We fair chewed the 
Nevsky Prospekt to pieces gallop- 
ing away.” 

“Didn’t you feel their stun guns, 
Dummkopf, when they sprung the 
trap — too soon, Gott sei Dank?” 
Erich demanded. 

“I did,” the New Boy told him. 
“Not enough to numb a cat. Why 
didn’t you show us action?” 
“Shut up. I’m your leader. I’ll 
show you action enough.” 

“You won’t. You’re a filthy Nazi 
coward.” 

“Weibischer Englander!” 
“Bloody Hun!” 

“ Schlange !” 

The blond lad knew enough 
German to understand that last 
crack. He threw back his sable- 
edged pelisse to clear his sword 
arm and he swung away from 
Erich, which bumped him into 
Beau. At the first sign of the quar- 
rel, Beau had raised himself from 
the divan as quickly and silently 
as a — no, I won’t use that word— 
and slithered over to them. 

“Sirs, you forget yourselves,” he 
said sharply, off balance, support- 
ing himself on the New Boy’s up- 
raised arm. “This is Sidney Les- 
singham’s Place of Entertainment 
and Recuperation. There are 
ladies — ” 

WITH a contemptuous snarl, 
’ ’ the New Boy shoved him 
off and snatched with his bare 



THE BIG TIME 



11 




hand for his saber. Beau reeled 
against the divan, it caught him 
in the shins and he fell toward 
the Maintainers. Sid whisked them 
out of the way as if they were a 
couple of beach radios — simply 
nothing in the Place is nailed down 
— and had them back on the cof- 
fee table before Beau hit the floor. 
Meanwhile, Erich had his saber 
out and had parried the New 
Boy’s first wild slash and lunged 
in return, and I heard the scream 
of steel and the rutch of his boot 
on the diamond-studded pave- 
ment. 

T3EAU rolled over and came up 
pulling from the ruffles of his 
shirt bosom a derringer I knew 
was some other weapon in disguise 
—a stun gun or even an Atropos. 
Besides scaring me damp for Erich 
and everybody, that brought me 
up short: us Entertainers’ nerves 
must be getting as naked as the 
Soldiers’, probably starting when 
the Spiders canceled all cosmic 
leaves twenty sleeps back. 

Sid shot Beau his look of com- 
mand, rapped out, “I’ll handle this, 
you whoreson firebrand,” and 
turned to the Minor Maintained I 
noticed that the telltale on the 
Major was glowing a reassuring 
red again, and I found a moment 
to thank Mamma Devi that the 
Door was shut. 

Maud was jumping up and 
down, cheering I don’t know which 



—nor did she, I bet— and the New 
Girl was white and I saw that the 
sabers were working more busi- 
nesslike. Erich’s flicked, flicked, 
flicked again and came away from 
the blond lad’s cheek spilling a 
couple of red drops. The blond lad 
lunged fiercely, Erich jumped back, 
and the next moment they were 
both floating helplessly in the air, 
twisting like they had cramps. 

I realized quick enough that 
Sid had shut off gravity in the 
Door and Stores sectors of the 
Place, leaving the rest of us firm 
on our feet in the Refresher and 
Surgery sectors. The Place has 
sectional gravity to suit our Extra- 
terrestrial buddies — those crazy 
ETs sometimes come whooping in 
for recuperation in very mixed 
batches. 

From his central position, Sid 
called out, kindly enough but tak- 
ing no nonsense, “All right, lads, 
you’ve had your fun. Now sheathe 
those swords.” 

For a second or so, the two 
black hussars drifted and contorted. 
Erich laughed harshly and neatly 
obeyed — the commandant is used 
to free fall. The blond lad stopped 
writhing, hesitated while he glared 
upside down at Erich and man- 
aged to get his saber into its scab- 
bard, although he turned a slow 
somersault doing it. Then Sid 
switched on their gravity, slow 
enough so they wouldn’t get 
sprained landing.

"C'RICH laughed, lightly this 
time, and stepped out briskly 
toward us. He stopped to clap the 
New Boy firmly on the shoulder 
and look him in the face. 

“So, now you get a good scar,” 
he said. 

The other didn't pull away, 
but he didn’t look up and Erich 
came on. Sid was hurrying toward 
the New Boy, and as he passed 
Erich, he wagged a finger at him 
and gayly said, “You rogue.” Next 
thing I was giving Erich my “Man, 
you’re home” hug and he was kiss- 
ing me and cracking my ribs and 
saying, “ Liebchen ! Doppchen!” — 
which was fine with me because 
I do love him and I’m a good lover 
and as much a Doubleganger as 
he is. 

We had just pulled back from 
each other to get a breath— his 
blue eyes looked so sweet in his 
worn face — when there was a 
thud behind us. With the snapping 
of the tension, Doc had fallen off 
his bar stool and his top hat was 
over his eyes. As we turned to 
chuckle at him, Maud squeaked 
and we saw that the Roman had 
walked straight up against the 
Void and was marching along there 
steadily without gaining a foot, like 
it does happen, his black uniform 
melting into that inside-your-head 
gray. 

Maud and Beau rushed over to 
fish him back, which can be tricky. 
The thin gambler was all courtly 



efficiency again. Sid supervised 
from a distance. 

“What’s wrong with him?” I 
asked Erich. 

He shrugged. “Overdue for 
Change Shock. And he was nearest 
the stun guns. His horse almost 
threw him. Mein Gott, you should 
have seen Saint Petersburg, Leib- 
chen: the Nevsky Prospekt, the 
canals flying by like reception car- 
pets of blue sky, a cavalry troop 
in blue and gold that blundered 
across our escape, fine women in 
furs and ostrich plumes, a monk 
with a big tripod and his head un- 
der a hood — it gave me the hor- 
rors seeing all those Zombies flash- 
ing past and staring at me in that 
sick unawakened way they have, 
and knowing that some of them, 
say the photographer, might be 
Snakes.” 

Our side in the Change War is 
the Spiders, the other side is the 
Snakes, though all of us — Spiders 
and Snakes alike — are Double- 
gangers and Demons too, because 
we’re cut out of our lifelines in 
the cosmos. Your lifeline is all of 
you from birth to death. We’re 
Doublegangers because we can 
operate both in the cosmos and 
outside of it, and Demons because 
we act reasonably alive while do- 
ing so — which the Ghosts don’t. 
Entertainers and Soldiers are all 
Demon-Doublegangers, whichever 
side they’re on — though they say 
the Snake Places are simply ghast-

ly. Zombies are dead people whose 
lifelines lie in the so-called past. 

tfWHAT were you doing in 
** Saint Petersburg before the 
ambush?” I asked Erich. “That is, 
if you can talk about it.” 

“Why not? We were kidnapping 
the infant Einstein back from the 
Snakes in 1883. Yes, the Snakes 
got him, Liebchen, only a few 
sleeps back, endangering the West’s 
whole victory over Russia—” 
“—which gave your dear little 
Hitler the world on a platter for 
fifty years and got me loved to 
death by your sterling troops in 
the Liberation of Chicago—” 

“—but which leads to the ulti- 
mate victory of the Spiders and 
the West over the Snakes and 
Communism, Leibchen, remember 
that. Anyway, our counter-snatch 
didn’t work. The Snakes had 
guards posted— most unusual and 
we weren’t warned. The whole 
thing was a great mess. No won- 
der Bruce lost his head— not that 
it excuses him.” 

“The New Boy?” I asked. Sid 
hadn’t got to him and he was still 
standing with hooded eyes where 
Erich had left him, a dark pillar 
of shame and rage. 

“Ja, a lieutenant from World 
War One. An Englishman.” 

“I gathered that,” I told Erich. 
“Is he really effeminate?” 

“W eibischer?” He smiled. “I had 
to call him something when he 



said I was a coward. He’ll make 
a fine Soldier — only needs a little 
more shaping.” 

“You men are so original when 
you spat.” I lowered my voice. 
“But you shouldn’t have gone on 
and called him a Snake, Erich 
mine.” 

“Schlange?” The smile got 
crooked. “Who knows— about any 
of us? As Saint Petersburg showed 
me, the Snakes’ spies are getting 
cleverer than ours.” The blue eyes 
didn’t look sweet now. “Are you, 
Liebchen, really nothing more than 
a good loyal Spider?” 

“Erich!” 

“All right, I went too far — with 
Bruce and with you too. We’re 
all hacked these days, riding with 
one leg over the breaking edge.” 

Maud and Beau were support- 
ing the Roman to a couch, Maud 
taking most of his weight, with Sid 
still supervising and the New Boy 
still sulking by himself. The New 
Girl should have been with him, 
of course, but I couldn’t see her 
anywhere and I decided she was 
probably having a nervous break- 
down in the Refresher, the little 
jerk. 

“The Roman looks pretty bad, 
Erich,” I said. 

“Ah, Mark’s tough. Got virtue, 
as his people say. And our little 
starship girl will bring him back 
to life if anybody can and if . .” 

“. you call this living,” I filled 
in dutifully.

UE was right. Maud had fifty- 
odd years of psychomedical 
experience, 23rd Century at that. 
It should have been Doc’s job, but 
that was fifty drunks back. 

“Maud and Mark, that will be 
an interesting experiment,” Erich 
said. “Reminiscent of Goering’s 
with the frozen men and the naked 
gypsy girls” 

“You are a filthy Nazi. She’ll be 
using electrophoresis and deep sug- 
gestion, if I know anything.” 
“How will you be able to know 
anything, Liebchen, if she switches 
on the couch curtains, as I per- 
ceive she is preparing to do?” 
“Filthy Nazi I said and meant.” 
“Precisely.” He clicked his heels 
and bowed a millimeter. “Erich 
Friederich von Hohenwald, Ober- 
leutnant in the army of the Third 
Reich. Fell at Narvik, where he 
was Recruited by the Spiders. Life- 
line lengthened by a Big Change 
after his first death and at latest 
report Commandant of Toronto, 
where he maintains extensive baby 
farms to provide him with break- 
fast meat, if you believe the hand- 
bills of the voyageurs underground. 
At your service.” 

“Oh, Erich, it’s all so lousy,” I 
said, touching his hand, reminded 
that he was one of the unfortunates 
Resurrected from a point in their 
lifelines well before their deaths— 
in his case, because the date of 
his death had been shifted forward 
by a Big Change after his Resur- 



rection. And as every Demon finds 
out, if he can’t imagine it before- 
hand, it is pure hell to remember 
your future, and the shorter the 
time between your Resurrection 
and your death back in the cosmos, 
the better. Mine, bless Bab-ed-Din, 
was only an action-packed ten 
minutes on North Clark Street. 

Erich put his other hand lightly 
over mine. “Fortunes of the Change 
War, Liebchen. At least I’m a 
Soldier and sometimes assigned 
to future operations— though why 
we should have this monomania 
about our future personalities back 
there, I don’t know. Mine is a 
stupid Oberst, thin as paper— and 
frightfully indignant at the voyag- 
eurs! But it helps me a little if I 
see him in perspective and at least 
I get back to the cosmos pretty 
regularly, Gott sei Dank, so I’m 
better off than you Entertainers.” 

I didn’t say aloud that a Chang- 
ing cosmos is worse than none, but 
I found myself sending a prayer to 
the Bonny Dew for my father’s 
repose, that the Change Winds 
would blow lightly across the life- 
line of Anton A. Forzane, profes- 
sor of physiology, born in Norway 
and buried in Chicago. Woodlawn 
Cemetery is a nice gray spot. 

“That’s all right, Erich,” I said. 
“We Entertainers Got Mittens too.” 

He scowled around at me sus- 
piciously, as if he were wondering 
whether I had all my buttons on. 

“Mittens?” he said. “What do 



THE BIG TIME 



15 




you mean? I’m not wearing any. 
Are you trying to say something 
about Bruce’s gloves — which in- 
cidentally seem to annoy him for 
some reason. No, seriously, Greta, 
why do you Entertainers need 
mittens?” 

“Because we get cold feet some- 
times. At least I do. Got Mittens, 
as I say.” 

A SICKLY light dawned in his 
Prussian puss. He muttered, 
“Got mittens . Gott nut uns . 
God with us,” and roared softly, 
“Greta, I don’t know how I put up 
with you, the way you murder 
a great language for cheap laughs.” 
“You’ve got to take me as I am,” 
I told him, “mittens and all, thank 
the Bonny Dew—” and hastily ex- 
plained, “That’s French — Je bon 
Dieu — the good God — don’t hit 
me. I’m not going to tell you any 
more of my secrets.” 

He laughed feebly, like he was 
dying. 

“Cheer up,” I said. “I won’t be 
here forever, and there are worse 
places than the Place.” 

He nodded grudgingly, looking 
around. “You know what, Greta, 
if you’ll promise not to make some 
dreadful joke out of it: on opera- 
tions, I pretend I’ll soon be going 
backstage to court the world- 
famous ballerina Greta Forzane.” 
He was right about the back- 
stage part. The Place is a regular 
theater-in-the-round with the Void 

16 



for an audience, the Void’s gray 
hardly disturbed by the screens 
masking Surgery (Ugh!), Re- 
fresher and Stores. Between the 
last two are the bar and kitchen 
and Beau’s piano. Between Sur- 
gery and the sector where the 
Door usually appears are the 
shelves and taborets of the Art 
Gallery. The control divan is stage 
center. Spaced around at a fair 
distance are six big low couches— 
one with its curtains now shooting 
up into the gray— and a few small 
tables. It is like a ballet set and 
the crazy costumes and characters 
that turn up don’t ruin the illusion. 
By no means. Diaghilev would 
have hired most of them for the 
Ballet Russe on first sight, with- 
out even asking them whether they 
could keep time to music. 

CHAPTER 2 

Last week in Babylon, 

Last night in Rome, 

— Hodgson 

A RIGHT-HAND GLOVE 

T>EAU had gone behind the bar 
" and was talking quietly at 
Doc, but with his eyes elsewhere, 
looking very sallow and profes- 
sional in his white, and I thought 
— Damballa! — I’m in the French 
Quarter. I couldn’t see the New 
Girl. Sid was at last getting to 
the New Boy after the fuss about 
Mark. He threw me a sign and I 
started over with Erich in tow. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Welcome, sweet lad. Sidney 
Lessingham’s your host, and a fel- 
low Englishman. Bom in King’s 
Lynn, 1564, schooled at Cambridge, 
but London was the life and death 
of me, though I outlasted Bessie, 
Jimmie, Charlie, and Ollie almost. 
And what a life! By turns a clerk, 
a spy, a bawd — the two trades 
are hand in glove — a poet of no 
account, a beggar, and a peddler of 
resurrection tracts. Beau Lassiter, 
our throats are tinder!” 

At the word “poet,” the New 
Boy looked up, but resentfully, 
as if he had been tricked into it. 

“And to spare your throat for 
drinking, sweet gallant, I’ll be so 
bold as to guess and answer one of 
your questions,” Sid rattled on. 
“Yes, I knew Will Shakespeare— 
we were of an age— and he was 
such a modest, mind-your-busi- 
ness rogue that we all wondered 
whether he really did write those 
plays. Your pardon, ’faith, but that 
scratch might be looked to.” 

Then I saw that the New Girl 
hadn’t lost her head, but gone to 
Surgery (Ugh!) for a first-aid 
tray. She reached a swab toward 
the New Boy’s sticky cheek, say- 
ing rather shrilly, “If I might . .” 
Her timing was bad. Sid’s last 
words and Erich’s approach had 
darkened the look in the young 
Soldier’s face and he angrily swept 
her arm aside without even glanc- 
ing at her. Erich squeezed my 
arm. The tray clattered to the floor 



—and one of the drinks that Beau 
was bringing almost followed it. 
Ever since the New Girl’s arrival, 
Beau had been figuring that she 
was his responsibility, though I 
don’t think the two of them had 
reached an agreement yet Beau 
was especially set on it because 
I was thick with Sid at the time 
and Maud with Doc, she loving 
tough cases. 

“Easy now, lad, and you love 
me!” Sid thundered, again shoot- 
ing Beau the “Hold it” look. “She’s 
just a poor pagan trying to com- 
fort you. Swallow your bile, you 
black villain, and perchance it will 
turn to poetry. Ah, did I touch 
you there? Confess, you are a 
poet.” 

T I ^HERE isn’t much gets by Sid, 
though for a second I forgot 
my psychology and wondered if 
he knew what he was doing with 
his insights. 

“Yes, I’m a poet, all right,” the 
New Boy roared. “I’m Bruce Mar- 
chant, you bloody Zombies. Fm 
a poet in a world where even the 
lines of the King James and your 
precious Will whom you use for 
laughs aren’t safe from Snakes’ 
slime and the Spiders’ dirty legs. 
Changing our history, stealing our 
certainties, claiming to be so blasted 
all-knowing and best intentioned 
and efficient, and what does it lead 
to? This bloody SI glove!” 

He held up his black-gloved left 



THE BIG TIME 



17 




hand which still held the mate and 
he shook it 

“What’s wrong with the Spider 
Issue gauntlet, heart of gold?” Sid 
demanded. “And you love us, tell 
us” While Erich laughed, “Con- 
sider yourself lucky, Kamerad. 
Mark and I didn’t draw any gloves 
at all.” 

“What’s wrong with it?” Bruce 
yelled. “The bloody things are 
both lefts!” He slammed it down 
on the floor. 

We all howled, we couldn’t help 
it. He turned his back on us and 
stamped off, though I guessed he 
would keep out of the Void. Erich 
squeezed my arm and said be- 
tween gasps, “ Mein Gott, Liebchen, 
what have I always told you about 
Soldiers? The bigger the gripe, the 
smaller the cause! It is infallible!” 

One of us didn’t laugh. Ever 
since the New Girl heard the name 
Bruce Marchant, she’d had a look 
in her eyes like she’d been given 
the sacrament. I was glad she’d 
got interested in something, be- 
cause she’d been pretty much of 
a snoot and a wet blanket up un- 
til now, although she’d come to 
the Place with the recommenda- 
tion of having been a real whoopee 
girl in London and New York in 
the Twenties. She looked disap- 
provingly at us as she gathered 
up the tray and stuff, not forget- 
ting the glove, which she placed on 
the center of the tray like a holy 
relic. 



T>EAU cut over and tried to talk 
•*-* to her, but she ghosted past him 
and once again he couldn’t do 
anything because of the tray in his 
hands. He came over and got rid 
of the drinks quick. I took a big 
gulp right away because I saw 
the New Girl stepping through the 
screen into Surgery and I hate 
to be reminded we have it and 
I’m glad Doc is too drunk to use 
it, some of the Arachnoid surgical 
techniques being very sickening 
as I know only too well from a 
personal experience that is num- 
ber one on my list of things to be 
forgotten. 

By that time, Bruce had come 
back to us, saying in a carefully 
hard voice, “Look here, it’s not 
the dashed glove itself, as you very 
well know, you howling Demons.” 

“What is it then, noble heart?” 
Sid asked, his grizzled gold beard 
heightening the effect of innocent 
receptivity. 

“It’s the principle of the thing,” 
Bruce said, looking around sharp- 
ly, but none of us cracked a smile. 
“It’s this mucking inefficiency and 
death of the cosmos— and don’t tell 
me that isn’t in the cards!— mas- 
querading as benign omniscient au- 
thority. The Spiders— and we don’t 
know who they are ultimately; it’s 
just a name; we see only agents 
like ourselves— the Spiders pluck 
us from the quiet graves of our 
lifelines—” 

“Is that bad, lad?” Sid mur- 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




mured, innocently straight-faced. 

“—and Resurrect us if they can 
and then tell us we must fight an- 
other time-traveling power called 
the Snakes — just a name, too — 
which is bent on perverting and 
enslaving the whole cosmos, past, 
present and future.” 

“And isn’t it, lad?” 

“Before we’re properly awake, 
we’re Recruited into the Big Time 
and hustled into tunnels and bur- 
rows outside our space-time, these 
miserable closets, gray sacks, puss 
pockets— no offense to this Place— 
that the Spiders have created, may- 
be by gigantic implosions, but no 
one knows for certain, and then 
we’re sent off on all sorts of mis- 
sions into the past and future to 
change history in ways that are 
supposed to thwart the Snakes.” 
“True, lad.” 

“And from then on, the pace is 
so flaming hot and heavy, the 
shocks come so fast, our emotions 
are wrenched in so many direc- 
tions, our public and private meta- 
physics distorted so insanely, the 
deepest thread of reality we cling 
to tied in such bloody knots, that 
we never can get things straight.” 
“We’ve all felt that way, lad,” 
Sid said soberly; Beau nodded his 
sleek death’s head; “You should 
have seen me, Kamerad, my first 
fifty sleeps,” Erich put in; while 
I added, “Us girls, too, Bruce.” 
“Oh, I know I’ll get hardened 
to it, and don’t think I can’t. It’s 



not that,” Bruce said harshly. “And 
I wouldn’t mind the personal con- 
fusion, the mess it’s made of my 
spirit, I wouldn’t even mind re- 
making history and destroying 
priceless, once-called imperishable 
beauties of the past, if I felt it 
were for the best. The Spiders 
assure us that, to thwart the 
Snakes, it is all-important that the 
West ultimately defeat the East. 
But what have they done to achieve 
this? I’ll give you some beautiful 
examples. To stabilize power in 
the early Mediterranean world, 
they have built up Crete at the 
expense of Greece, making Athens 
a ghost city, Plato a trivial fabu- 
list, and putting all Greek culture 
in a minor key.” 

got time for culture?” 
-I- I heard myself say and I 
clapped my hand over my mouth 
in gentle reproof. 

“But you remember the dia- 
logues, lad,” Sid observed. “And 
rail not at Crete— I have a sweet 
Keftian friend.” 

“For how long will I remem- 
ber Plato’s dialogues? And who 
after me?” Bruce challenged. 
“Here’s another. The Spiders want 
Rome powerful and, to date, 
they’ve helped Rome so much that 
she collapses in a blaze of Ger- 
man and Parthian invasions a few 
years after the death of Julius 
Caesar.” 

This time it was Beau who

butted in. Most everybody in the 
Place loves these bull sessions. 
“You omit to mention, sir, that 
Rome’s newest downfall is directly 
due to the Unholy Triple Alliance 
the Snakes have fomented between 
the Eastern Classical World, Mo- 
hammedanized Christianity, and 
Marxist Communism, trying to 
pass the torch of power future- 
wards by way of Byzantium and 
the Eastern Church, without ever 
letting it pass into the hands of 
the Spider West. That, sir, 
is the Snakes’ Three-Thousand- 
Year Plan which we are fighting 
against, striving to revive Rome’s 
glories.” 

“Striving is the word for it,” 
Bruce snapped. “Here’s yet an- 
other example. To beat Russia, the 
Spiders kept England and America 
out of World War Two, thereby 
ensuring a German invasion of 
the New World and creating a 
Nazi empire stretching from the 
salt mines of Siberia to the plan- 
tations of Iowa, from Nizhni Nov- 
gorod to Kansas City!” 

He stopped and my short hairs 
prickled. Behind me, someone 
was chanting in a weird spiritless 
voice, like footsteps in hard snow. 

“Salz, Salz, bringe Salz. Keiri 
Peitscft, gnadige Herren. Salz, 
Salz, Salz.” 

I turned and there was Doc 
waltzing toward us with little tiny 
steps, bent over so low that the 
ends of his shawl touched the 



floor, his head crooked up side- 
ways and looking through us. 

I knew then, but Erich trans- 
lated softly. “‘Salt, salt, I bring 
salt. No whip, merciful sirs.’ He 
is speaking to my countrymen in 
their language.” Doc had spent 
his last months in a Nazi-operated 
salt mine. 

TTE saw us and got up, straight- 
ening his top hat very care- 
fully. He frowned hard while my 
heart thumped half a dozen times. 
Then his face slackened, he 
shrugged his shoulders and mut- 
tered, “Nichevo.” 

“And it does not matter, sir,” 
Beau translated, but directing his 
remark at Bruce. “True, great civi- 
lizations have been dwarfed or 
broken by the Change War. But 
others, once crushed in the bud, 
have bloomed. In the 1870s, I 
traveled a Mississippi that had 
never known Grant’s gunboats. I 
studied piano, languages, and the 
laws of chance under the greatest 
European masters at the Univer- 
sity of Vicksburg.” 

“And you think your pipsqueak 
steamboat culture is compensa- 
tion for — ” Bruce began but, 
“Prithee none of that, lad,” Sid in- 
terrupted smartly. “Nations are as 
equal as so many madmen or 
drunkards, and I’ll drink dead 
drunk the man who disputes me. 
Hear reason: nations are not so 
puny as to shrivel and vanish at 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the first tampering with their past, 
no, nor with the tenth. Nations are 
monsters, boy, with guts of iron 
and nerves of brass. Waste not 
your pity on them.” 

“True indeed, sir,” Beau pressed, 
cooler and keener for the attack on 
his Greater South. “Most of us en- 
ter the Change World with the 
false metaphysic that the slightest 
change in the past — a grain of 
dust misplaced— will transform the 
whole future. It is a long while 
before we accept with our minds 
as well as our intellects the law 
of the Conservation of Reality: 
that when the past is changed, the 
future changes barely enough to 
adjust, barely enough to admit the 
new data. The Change Winds 
meet maximum resistance always. 
Otherwise the first operation in 
Babylonia would have wiped out 
New Orleans, Sheffield, Stuttgart, 
and Maud Davies' birthplace on 
Ganymede! 

“Note how the gap left by 
Rome’s collapse was filled by the 
imperialistic and Christianized Ger- 
mans. Only an expert Demon his- 
torian can tell the difference in 
most ages between the former 
Latin and the present Gothic 
Catholic Church. As you yourself, 
sir, said of Greece, it is as if an 
old melody were shifted into a 
slightly different key. In the wake 
of a Big Change, cultures and in- 
dividuals are transposed, it’s true, 
yet in the main they continue 



much as they were, except for the 
usual scattering of unfortunate but 
statistically meaningless accidents.” 
“All right, you bloody savants— 
maybe I pushed my point too far,” 
Bruce growled. “But if you want 
variety, give a thought to the rot- 
ten methods we use in our won- 
derful Change War. Poisoning 
Churchill and Cleopatra. Kidnap- 
ping Einstein when he’s a baby.” 
“The Snakes did it first,” I re- 
minded him. 

“Yes, and we copied them. How 
resourceful does that make us?” 
he retorted, arguing like a woman. 
“If we need Einstein, why don’t 
we Resurrect him, deal with him 
as a man?” 

¥>EAU said, serving his culture 
" in slightly thicker slices, “Par- 
donnez-moi, but when you have 
enjoyed your status as Double- 
ganger a soupcon longer, you will 
understand that great men can 
rarely be Resurrected. Their be- 
ings are too crystalized, sir, their 
lifelines too tough.” 

“Pardon me, but I think that’s 
rot. I believe that most great men 
refuse to make the bargain with 
the Snakes, or with us Spiders 
either. They scorn Resurrection 
at the price demanded.” 

“Brother, they ain’t that great,” 
I whispered, while Beau glided 
on with, “However that may be, 
you have accepted Resurrection, 
sir, and so incurred an obligation 



THE BIG TIME 



21 




which you as a gentleman must 
honor.” 

“I accepted Resurrection all 
right,” Bruce said, a glare coming 
into his eyes. '‘When they pulled 
me out of my line at Passchen- 
daele in ’17 ten minutes before 
I died, I grabbed at the offer of life 
like a drunkard grabs at a drink 
the morning after. But even then 
I thought I was also seizing a 
chance to undo historic wrongs, 
work for peace.” His voice was 
getting wilder all the time. Just 
beyond our circle, I noticed the 
New Girl watching him worship- 
fully. “But what did I find the 
Spiders wanted me for? Only to 
fight more wars, over and over 
again, make them crueler and 
stinkinger, cut the swath of death 
a little wider with each Big Change, 
work our way a little closer to 
the death of the cosmos.” 

Sid touched my wrist and, as 
Bruce raved on, he whispered to 
me, “What kind of ball, think you, 
will please and so quench this fire- 
brained rogue? And you love me, 
discover it” 

I whispered back without taking 
my eyes off Bruce either, “I know 
somebody who’ll be happy to put 
on any kind of ball he wants, if 
he’ll just notice her.” 

“The New Girl, sweetling? ’Tis 
well. This rogue speaks like an 
angry angel. It touches my heart 
and I like it not.” 

Bruce was saying hoarsely but 



loudly, “And so we’re sent on 
operations in the past and from 
each of those operations the 
Change Winds blow futurewards, 
swiftly or slowly according to the 
opposition they breast, sometimes 
rippling into each other, and any 
one of those Winds may shift the 
date of our own death ahead of the 
date of our Resurrection, so that 
in an instant— even here, outside 
the cosmos— we may molder and 
rot or crumble to dust and vanish 
away. The wind with our name 
in it may leak through the Door.” 

TRACES hardened at that, be- 
cause it’s bad form to mention 
Change Death, and Erich flared 
out with, “Halt's Maul, Kamarad! 
There’s always another Resurrec- 
tion.” 

But Bruce didn’t keep his mouth 
shut. He said, “Is there? I know 
the Spiders promise it, but even 
if they do go back and cut an- 
other Doubleganger from my life- 
line, is he me?” He slapped his 
chest with his bare hand. “I don’t 
think so. And even if he is me, with 
unbroken consciousness, why’s he 
been Resurrected again? Just to 
refight more wars and face more 
Change Death for the sake of an 
almighty power—” his voice was 
rising to a climax — “an almighty 
power so bloody ineffectual, it 
can’t furnish one poor Soldier 
pulled out of the mud of Pas- 
schendaele, one miserable Change 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Commando, one Godforsaken Re- 
cuperee a proper issue of equip- 
ment!” 

And he held out his bare right 
hand toward us, fingers spread a 
little, as if it were the most amaz- 
ing object and most deserving of 
outraged sympathy in the whole 
world. 

The New Girl’s timing was per- 
fect. She whisked through us, and 
before he could so much as wiggle 
the fingers, she whipped a black 
gauntleted glove on it and any- 
one could see that it fitted his hand 
perfectly. 

This time our laughing beat the 
other. We collapsed and slopped 
our drinks and pounded each other 
on the back and then started all 
over. 

“Ach, der Handschuh, Liebchen! 
Where’d she get it?” Erich gasped 
in my ear. 

“Probably just turned the other 
one inside out— that turns a left 
into a right— I’ve done it myself,” 
I wheezed, collapsing again at the 
idea. 

“That would put the lining out- 
side,” he objected. 

“Then I don’t know,” I said. 
“We got all sorts of junk in Stores.” 

“It doesn’t matter, Liebchen ” 
he assured me. “Ach, der Hand- 
schuh!” 

All through it, Bruce just stood 
there admiring the glove, moving 
the fingers a little now and then, 
and the New Girl stood watching 



him as if he were eating a cake 
she’d baked. 

HEN the hysteria quieted 
” down, he looked up at her 
with a big smile. “What did you 
say your name was?” 

“Lili,” she said, and believe you 
me, she was Lili to me even in 
my thoughts from then on, for the 
way she’d handled that lunatic. 

“Lilian Foster,” she explained. 
“I’m English also. Mr. Marchant, 
I’ve read A Young Man’s Fancy 
I don’t know how many times.” 
“You have? It’s wretched stuff. 
From the Dark Ages— I mean my 
Cambridge days. In the trenches, 
I was working up some poems 
that were rather better.” 

“I won’t hear you say that. But 
I’d be terribly thrilled to hear the 
new ones. Oh, Mr. Marchant, it 
was so strange to hear you call it 
Passiondale.” 

“Why, if I may ask?” 

“Because that’s the way I pro- 
nounce it to myself. But I looked 
it up and it’s more like Pas-ken- 
DA-luh.” 

“Bless you! All the Tommies 
called it Passiondale, just as they 
called Ypres Wipers.” 

“How interesting. You know, 
Mr. Marchant, I’ll wager we were 
Recruited in the same operation, 
summer of 1917. I’d got to France 
as a Red Cross nurse, but they 
found out my age and were going 
to send me back.” 



THE BIG TIME 



23 




“How old were you — are you? 
Same thing, I mean to say.” 
“Seventeen.” 

“Seventeen in ’17,” Bruce mur- 
mured, his blue eyes glassy. 

It was real corny dialogue and 
I couldn’t resent the humorous 
leer Erich gave me as we listened 
to them, as if to say, “Ain’t it nice, 
Liebchen, Bruce has a silly little 
English schoolgirl to occupy him 
between operations?” 

Just the same, as I watched Lili 
in her dark bangs and pearl neck- 
lace and tight little gray dress that 
reached barely to her knees, and 
Bruce hulking over her tenderly 
in his snazzy hussar’s rig, I knew 
that I was seeing the start of some- 
thing that hadn’t been part of me 
since Dave died fighting Franco 
years before I got on the Big Time, 
the sort of thing that almost made 
me wish there could be children 
in the Change World. I wondered 
why I’d never thought of trying 
to work things so that Dave got 
Resurrected and I told myself : 
no, it’s all changed, I’ve changed, 
better the Change Winds don’t dis- 
turb Dave or I know about it. 

“No, I didn’t die in 1917 — I 
was merely Recruited then,” Lili 
was telling Bruce. “I lived all 
through the Twenties, as you can 
see from the way I dress. But let’s 
not talk about that, shall we? Oh, 
Mr. Marchant, do you think you 
can possibly remember any of 
those poems you started in the 



trenches? I can’t fancy them bet- 
tering your sonnet that concludes 
with, ‘The bough swings in the 
wind, the night is deep; Look at 
the stars, poor little ape, and 
sleep.’ ” 

That one almost made me 
whoop— what monkeys we are, I 
thought— though I’d be the first to 
admit that the best line to use on 
a poet is one of his own— in fact, 
as many as possible. I decided I 
could safely forget our little Britons 
and devote myself to Erich or 
whatever needed me. 

CHAPTER 3 

Hell is the place for me. For to 
Hell go the fine churchmen, and 
the fine knights, killed in the 
tourney or in some grand war, 
the brave soldiers and the gal- 
lant gentlemen. With them will 
I go. There go also the fair 
gracious ladies who have lovers 
two or three beside their lord. 
There go the gold and the silver, 
the sables and ermine. There 
go the harpers and the minstrels 
and the kings of the earth.

NINE FOR A PARTY 

T EXCHANGED my drink for 
a new one from another tray 
Beau was bringing around. The 
gray of the Void was beginning 
to look real pleasant, like warm 
thick mist with millions of tiny 
diamonds floating in it. Doc was 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




sitting grandly at the bar with a 
steaming tumbler of tea — a chaser, 
I guess, since he was just putting 
down a shot glass. Sid was talking 
to Erich and laughing at the same 
time and I said to myself it begins 
to feel like a party, but some- 
thing’s lacking. 

It wasn’t anything to do with 
the Major Maintainer; its telltale 
was glowing a steady red like a 
nice little home fire amid the tight 
cluster of dials that included all 
the controls except the lonely and 
frightening Introversion switch that 
was never touched. Then Maud’s 
couch curtains winked out and 
there were she and the Roman 
sitting quietly side by side. 

He looked down at his shiny 
boots and the rest of his black 
duds like he was just waking up 
and couldn’t believe it all, and he 
said, “Omnia mutantur, nos et mu- 
tamur in illis,” and I raised my 
eyebrows at Beau, who was taking 
the tray back, and he did proud 
by old Vicksburg by translating: 
“All things change and we change 
with them.” 

Then Mark slowly looked 
around at us, and I can testify that 
a Roman smile is just as warm as 
any other nationality, and he final- 
ly said, “We are nine, the proper 
number for a party. The couches, 
too. It is good.” 

Maud chuckled proudly and 
Erich shouted, “Welcome back 
from the Void, Kamerad,” and 



then, because he’s German and 
thinks all parties have to be noisy 
and satirically pompous, he jumped 
on a couch and announced, “Her- 
ren und Damen, permit me to in- 
troduce the noblest Roman of 
them all, Marcus Vipsaius Niger, 
legate to Nero Claudius (called 
Germanicus in a former time 
stream) and who in 763 A.U.C. 
(Correct, Mark? It means 10 A.D., 
you meatheads!) died bravely 
fighting the Parthians and the 
Snakes in the Battle of Alexandria. 
Hoch, hoch, hoch!” 

E all swung our glasses and 
cheered with him and Sid 
yelled at Erich, “Keep your feet 
off the furniture, you unschooled 
rogue,” and grinned and boomed 
at all three hussars, “Take your 
ease, Recuperees,” and Maud and 
Mark got their drinks, the Roman 
paining Beau by refusing Faler- 
nian wine in favor of scotch and 
soda, and right away everyone was 
talking a mile a minute. 

We had a lot to catch up on. 
There was the usual yak about the 
war— “The Snakes are laying mine 
fields in the Void,” “I don’t believe 
it, how can you mine nothing?” — 
and the shortages— bourbon, bobby 
pins, and the stabilitin that would 
have brought Mark out of it faster 
—and what had become of people 
—“Marcia? Oh, she’s not around 
any more,” (She’d been caught in 
a Change Gale and green and 




THE BIG TIME

stinking in five seconds, but I 
wasn’t going to say that) — and 
Mark had to be told about Bruce’s 
glove, which convulsed us all over 
again, and the Roman remembered 
a legionary who had carried a gripe 
all the way to Octavius because 
he’d accidentally been issued the 
unbelievable luxury item sugar in- 
stead of the usual salt, and Erich 
asked Sid if he had any new Ghost- 
girls in stock and Sid sucked his 
beard like the old goat he is. “Dost 
thou ask me, lusty Allemand? Nay, 
there are several great beauties, 
amongst them an Austrian countess 
from Strauss’s Vienna, and if it 
were not for sweetling here . 
Mnnnn” 

I poked a finger in Erich’s chest 
between two of the bright buttons 
with their tiny death’s heads. “You, 
my little von Hohenwald, are a 
menace to us real girls. You have 
too much of a thing about the un- 
awakened, ghost kind.” 

He called me his little Demon 
and hugged me a bit too hard to 
prove it wasn’t so, and then he 
suggested we show Bruce the Art 
Gallery. I thought this was a real 
brilliant idea, but when I tried to 
argue him out of it, he got stub- 
born. Bruce and Lili were willing 
to do anything anyone wanted 
them to, though not so willing to 
pay any attention while doing it. 
The saber cut was just a thin red 
line on his cheek; she’d washed 
away all the dried blood. 



The Gallery gets you, though. 
It’s a bunch of paintings and sculp- 
tures and especially odd knick- 
knacks, all made by Soldiers re- 
cuperating here, and a lot of them 
telling about the Change War from 
the stuff they’re made of — brass 
cartridges, flaked flint, bits of an- 
cient pottery glued into futuristic 
shapes, mashed-up Incan gold 
rebeaten by a Martian, whorls of 
beady Lunan wire, a picture in 
tempera on a crinkle-cracked thick 
round of quartz that had filled a 
starship porthole, a Sumerian in- 
scription chiseled into a brick from 
an atomic oven. 

r I ^HERE are a lot of things in 
the Gallery and I can always 
find some I haven’t ever seen be- 
fore. It gets you, as I say, think- 
ing about the guys that made them 
and their thoughts and the far 
times and places they came from, 
and sometimes, when I’m feeling 
low, I’ll come and look at them so 
I’ll feel still lower and get inspired 
to kick myself back into a good 
temper. It’s the only history of the 
Place there is and it doesn’t change 
a great deal, because the things 
in it and the feelings that went into 
them resist the Change Winds bet- 
ter than anything else. 

Right now, Erich’s witty lec- 
ture was bouncing off the big ears 
I hide under my pageboy bob and 
I was thinking how awful it is that 
for us that there’s not only change 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




but Change. You don’t know from 
one minute to the next whether a 
mood or idea you’ve got is really 
new or just welling up into you 
because the past has been altered 
by the Spiders or Snakes. 

Change Winds can blow not 
only death but anything short of 
it, down to the featheriest fancy. 
They blow thousands of times 
faster than time moves, but no 
one can say how much faster or 
how far one of them will travel 
or what damage it’ll do or how 
soon it’ll damp out. The Big Time 
isn’t the little time. 

And then, for the Demons, 
there’s the fear that our personality 
will just fade and someone else 
climb into the driver’s seat and us 
not even know. Of course, we De- 
mons are supposed to be able to 
remember through Change and 
in spite of it; that’s why we are 
Demons and not Ghosts like the 
other Doublegangers, or merely 
Zombies or Unborn and nothing 
more, and as Beau truly said, there 
aren’t any great men among us— 
and blamed few of the masses, 
either— we're a rare sort of people 
and that’s why the Spiders have 
to Recruit us where they find us 
without caring about our previous 
knowledge and background, a For- 
eign Legion of time, a strange kind 
of folk, bright but always in the 
background, with built-in nostal- 
gia and cynicism, as adaptable as 
Centaurian shape-changers but 



with memories as long as a Lunan’s 
six arms, a kind of Change People, 
you might say, the cream of the 
damned. 

But sometimes I wonder if our 
memories are as good as we think 
they are and if the whole past 
wasn’t once entirely different from 
anything we remember, and we’ve 
forgotten that we forgot. 

As I say, the Gallery gets you 
feeling real low, and so now I 
said to myself, “Back to your lousy 
little commandant, kid,” and gave 
myself a stiff boot. 

Erich was holding up a green 
bowl with gold dolphins or space- 
ships on it and saying, “And, to 
my mind, this proves that Etruscan 
art is derived from Egyptian. Don’t 
you agree, Bruce?” 

Bruce looked up, all smiles from 
Lili, and said, “What was that, 
dear chap?” 

"C 1 RICH’S forehead got dark as 
the Door and I was glad the 
hussars had parked their sabers 
along with their shakos, but before 
he could even get out a Jerry cuss- 
word, Doc breezed up in that 
plateau-state of drunkenness so 
like hypnotized sobriety, moving 
as if he were on a dolly, ghosted 
the bowl out of Erich’s hand, said, 
“A beautiful specimen of Middle 
Systemic Venusian. When Eight- 
aitch finished it, he told me you 
couldn’t look at it and not feel 
the waves of the Northern Venu- 



THE BIG TIME 



27 




sian Shallows rippling around your 
hoofs. But it might look better in- 
verted. I wonder. Who are you, 
young officer? Nichevo," and he 
carefully put the bowl back on its 
shelf and rolled on. 

It’s a fact that Doc knows the 
Art Gallery better than any of us, 
really by heart, he being the oldest 
inhabitant, though he maybe picked 
a bad time to show off his knowl- 
edge. Erich was going to take out 
after him, but I said, “Nix, Ka - 
merad, remember gloves and 
sugar,” and he contented himself 
with complaining, “That nichevo— 
it’s so gloomy and hopeless, unge- 
heuerlich. I tell you, Liebchen, 
they shouldn’t have Russians work- 
ing for the Spiders, not even as 
Entertainers.” 

I grinned at him and squeezed 
his hand. “Not much entertainment 
in Doc these days, is there?” I 
agreed. 

He grinned back at me a shade 
sheepishly and his face smoothed 
and his blue eyes looked sweet 
again for a second and he said, “I 
shouldn’t want to claw out at peo- 
ple that way, Greta, but at times 
I am just a jealous old man,” 
which is not entirely true, as he 
isn’t a day over thirty-three, al- 
though his hair is nearly white. 

Our lovers had drifted on a few 
steps until they were almost fad- 
ing into the Surgery screen. It was 
the last spot I would have picked 
for the formal preliminaries to a 



little British smootching, but Lili 
probably didn’t share my preju- 
dices, though I remembered she’d 
told me she’d served a brief hitch 
in an Arachnoid Field Hospital be- 
fore being transferred to the Place. 

But she couldn’t have had any- 
thing like the experience I’d had 
during my short and sour career 
as a Spider nurse, when I’d ac- 
quired my best-hated nightmare 
and flopped completely (jobwise, 
but on the floor, too) at seeing a 
doctor flick a switch and a being, 
badly injured but human, turn 
into a long cluster of glistening 
strange fruit— ugh, it always makes 
me want to toss my cookies and 
my buttons. And to think that dear 
old Daddy Anton wanted his Greta 
chile to be a doctor. 

VK/ELL, I could see this wasn’t 
” getting me anywhere I wanted 
to go, and after all there was a 
party going on. 

Doc was babbling something at 
a great rate to Sid— I just hoped 
Doc wouldn’t get inspired to go 
into his animal imitations, which 
sound pretty fierce and once seri- 
ously offended some recuperating 
ETs. 

Maud was demonstrating to 
Mark a 23rd Century twostep and 
Beau sat down at the piano and 
improvised softly on her rhythm. 

As the deep-thrumming relax- 
ing notes hit us, Erich’s face bright- 
ened and he dragged me over. 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Pleasantly soon I had my feet off 
the diamond-rough floor, which we 
don’t carpet because most of the 
ETs, the dear boys, like it hard, 
and I was shouldering back deep 
into the couch nearest the piano, 
with cushions all around me and a 
fresh drink in my hand, while my 
Nazi boy friend was getting ready 
to discharge his Weltschmerz as 
song, which didn’t alarm me too 
much, as his baritone is passable. 

Things felt real good, like the 
Maintainer was just idling to keep 
the Place in existence and moored 
to the cosmos, not exerting itself 
at all or at most taking an occa- 
sional lazy paddle stroke. At times 
the Place’s loneliness can be hap- 
py and comfortable. 

Then Beau raised an eyebrow 
at Erich, who nodded, and next 
thing they were launched into a 
song we all know, though I’ve 
never found out where it originally 
came from. This time it made me 
think of Lili, and I wondered why 
—and why it’s a tradition at Re- 
cuperation. Stations to call the new 
girl Lili, though in this case it hap- 
pened to be -her real name. 

Standing in the Doorway just 
outside of space, 

Winds of Change blow ’ round 
you but don’t touch your face; 

You smile as you whisper 
tenderly, 

“ Please cross to me, Recuperee; 

“The operation’s over, come 
in and close the Door.”

SOS FROM NOWHERE 

T REALIZED the piano had de- 
serted Erich and I cranked my 
head up and saw Beau, Maud and 
Sid streaking for the control divan. 
The Major Maintainer was blink- 
ing emergency-green and fast, but 
the code was plain enough for even 
me to recognize the Spider dis- 
tress call and for a second I felt 
just sick. Then Erich blew out his 
reserve breath in the middle of 
“Door” and I gave myself another 
of those helpful mental boots at 
the base of the spine and we hur- 
ried after them toward the center 
of the Place along with Mark. 

The blinks faded as we got there 
and Sid told us not to move be- 
cause we were making shadows. 
He glued an eye to the telltale and 
we held still as statues as he 
caressed the dials like he was mak- 
ing love. 

One sensitive hand flicked out 
past the Introversion switch over 
to the Minor Maintainer and right 
away the Place was dark as your 
soul and there was nothing for me 
but Erich’s arm and the knowl- 
edge that Sid was nursing a green 
light I couldn’t even see, although 



THE BIG TIME 



29 




my eyes had plenty time to ac- 
commodate. 

Then the green light finally 
came back very slowly and I could 
see the dear reliable old face— the 
green-gold beard making him look 
like a merman— and then the tell- 
tale flared bright and Sid flicked 
on the Place lights and I leaned 
back. 

“That nails them, lads, whoever 
and whenever they may be. Get 
ready for a pick-up.” 

Beau, who was closest of course, 
looked at him sharply. Sid shrugged 
uneasily. “Meseemed at first it was 
from our own globe a thousand 
years before our Lord, but that in- 
dication flickered and faded like 
witchfire. As it is, the call comes 
from something smaller than the 
Place and certes adrift from the 
cosmos. Meseemed too at one 
point I knew the fist of the caller 
—an antipodean atomicist named 
Benson-Carter — but that likewise 
changed.” 

Beau said, “We’re not in the 
right phase of the cosmos-Places 
rhythm for a pick-up, are we, sir?” 
Sid answered, “Ordinarily not, 
boy.” 

Beau continued, “I didn’t think 
we had any pick-ups scheduled. 
Or stand-by orders.” 

Sid said, “We haven’t” 

Mark’s eyes glowed. He tapped 
Erich on the shoulder. “An oc- 
tavian denarius against ten Reichs- 
marks it is a Snake trap.” 



Erich’s grin showed his teeth. 
“Make it first through the Door 
next operation and I’m on.” 

¥T didn’t take that to tell me 
-*■ things were serious, or the 
thought that there’s always a first 
time for bumping into something 
from really outside the cosmos. 
The Snakes have broken our code 
more than once. Maud was quiet- 
ly serving out weapons and Doc 
was helping her. Only Bruce and 
Lili stood off. But they were watch- 
ing. 

The telltale brightened. Sid 
reached toward the Maintained 
saying, “All right, my hearties. Re- 
member, through this Doorway 
pass the fishiest finaglers in and out 
of the cosmos.” 

The Door appeared to the left 
and above where it should be and 
darkened much too fast There 
was a gust of stale salt seawind, 
if that makes sense, but no 
stepped-up Change Winds I could 
tell— and I had been bracing my- 
self against them. The Door got 
inky and there was a flicker of gray 
fur whips and a flash of copper 
flesh and gilt and something dark 
and a clump of hoofs and Erich 
was sighting a stun gun across his 
left forearm, and then the Door 
had vanished like that and a ten- 
tacled silvery Lunan and a Venu- 
sian satyr were coming straight 
toward us. 

The Lunan was hugging a pile 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




of clothes and weapons. The satyr 
was helping a wasp-waisted woman 
carry a heavy-looking bronze chest 
The woman was wearing a short 
skirt and high-collared bolero 
jacket of leather so dark brown it 
was almost black. She had a two- 
horned petsoia hairdress and she 
was boldly gilded here and there 
and wore sandals and copper 
anklets and wristlets— one of them 
a copper-plated Caller— and from 
her wide copper belt hung a short- 
handled double-headed ax. She 
was dark-complexioned and her 
forehead and chin receded, but the 
effect was anything but weak; she 
had a face like a beautiful arrow- 
head— and a familiar one, by golly! 

But before I could say, “Kaby- 
sia Labrys,” Maud shrilly beat me 
to it with, “It’s Kaby with two 
friends. Break out a couple of 
Ghostgirls.” 

And then I saw it really was 
old-home week because I recog- 
nized my Lunan boy friend Ilhili- 
his, and in the midst of all the con- 
fusion I got a nice kick out of 
knowing I was getting so I could 
tell the personality of one silver- 
furred muzzle from another. 

They reached the control divan 
and Illy dumped his load and 
the others let down the chest, and 
Kaby staggered but shook off the 
two ETs when they started to sup- 
port her, and she looked daggers 
at Sid when he tried to do the 
same, although she’s his “sweet 



Keftian friend” he’d mentioned to 
Bruce. 

CHE leaned straight-armed on 
^ the divan and took two gasp- 
ing breaths so deep that the ridges 
of her spine showed through her 
brown-skinned waist, and then she 
threw up her head and com- 
manded, “Wine!” 

While Beau was rushing it, Sid 
tried to take her hand again, say- 
ing, “Sweetling, I’d never heard 
you call before and knew not this 
pretty little fist,” but she ripped 
out, “Save your comfort for the 
Lunan,” and I looked and saw— 
Hey, Zeus!— that one of Ilhilihis’ 
six tentacles was lopped off half- 
way. 

That was for me, and, going to 
him, I fast briefed myself: “Re- 
member, he only weighs fifty 
pounds for all he’s seven feet high; 
he doesn’t like low sounds or to 
be grabbed; the two legs aren’t ten- 
tacles and don’t act the same; uses 
them for long walks, tentacles for 
leaps; uses tentacles for close vi- 
sion too and for manipulation, of 
course; extended, they mean he’s 
at ease; retracted, on guard or 
nervous; sharply retracted, dis- 
gusted; greeting—” 

Just then, one of them swept 
across my face like a sweet-smell- 
ing feather duster and I said, “Illy, 
man, it’s been a lot of sleeps,” and 
brushed my fingers across his muz- 
zle. It still took a little self-con- 



THE BIG TIME

trol not to hug him, and I did 
reach a little cluckingly for his 
lopped tentacle, but he wafted it 
away from me and the little voice- 
box belted to his side squeaked, 
“Naughty, naughty. Papa will fix 
his little old self. Greta girl, ever 
bandaged even a Terra octopus?” 

I had, an intelligent one from 
around a quarter billion A.D., but I 
didn’t tell him so. I stood and let 
him talk to the palm of my hand 
with one of his tentacles— I don’t 
savvy feather-talk but it feels good, 
though I’ve often wondered who 
taught him English— and watched 
him use a couple others to whisk 
a sort of Lunan band-aid out of 
his pouch and cap his wound with 
it. 

Meanwhile, the satyr knelt over 
the bronze chest, which was deco- 
rated with little death’s heads and 
crosses with hoops at the top and 
swastikas, but looking much older 
than Nazi, and the satyr said to 
Sid, “Quick thinkin, Gov, when 
ya saw the Door comin in high n 
soffened up gravty unner it, but 
cud I hav sum hep now?” 

Sid touched the Minor Main- 
tainer and we all got very light 
and my stomach did a flip-flop 
while the satyr piled on the chest 
the clothes and weapons that Illy 
had been carrying and pranced 
off with it all and carefully put it 
down at the end of the bar. I de- 
cided the satyr’s English instruc- 
tor must have been quite a charac- 



ter, too. Wish I’d met him— her— it. 

Sid thought to ask Illy if he 
wanted Moon-normal gravity in 
one sector, but my boy likes to 
mix, and being such a lightweight, 
Earth-normal gravity doesn’t 
bother him. As he said to me 
once, “Would Jovian gravity bother 
a beetle, Greta girl?” 

T ASKED Illy about the satyr 
and he squeaked that his name 
was Sevensee and that he’d never 
met him before this operation. I 
knew the satyrs were from a bil- 
lion years in the future, just as 
the Loonies were from a billion in 
the past, and I thought— Kreesed

us!— but it must have been a real 
big or emergency-like operation to 
have the Spiders using those two 
for it, with two billion years be- 
tween them— a time-difference that 
gives you a feeling of awe for a 
second, you know. 

I started to ask Illy about it, but 
just then Beau came scampering 
back from the bar with a big red- 
and-black earthenware goblet of 
wine— we try to keep a variety of 
drinking tools in stock so folks 
will feel more at home. Kaby 
grabbed it from him and drained 
most of it in one swallow and then 
smashed it on the floor. She does 
things like that, though Sid’s tried 
to teach her better. Then she stared 
at what she was thinking about 
until the whites showed all around 
her eyes and her lips pulled way 
back from her teeth and she looked 
a lot less human than the two ETs, 
just like a fury. Only a time trav- 
eler knows how like the wild 
murals and engravings of them 
some of the ancients can look. 

My hair stood up at the screech 
she let out. She smashed a fist into 
the divan and cried, “Goddess! 
Must I see Crete destroyed, re- 
vived, and now destroyed again? 
It is too much for your servant.” 

Personally, I thought she could 
stand anything. 

There was a rush of questions 
at what she said about Crete— I 
asked one of them, for the news 
certainly frightened me— but she 



shot up her arm straight for si- 
lence and took a deep breath and 
began. 

“In the balance hung the battle. 
Rowing like black centipedes, the 
Dorian hulls bore down on our 
outnumbered ships. On the bright 
beach, masked by rocks, Sevensee 
and I stood by the needle gun, 
ready to give the black hulls silent 
wounds. Beside us was Ilhilihis, 
suited as a sea monster. But 
then . then . 

Then I saw she wasn’t alto- 
gether the iron babe, for her voice 
broke and she started to shake 
and to sob rackingly, although her 
face was still a mask of rage, and 
she threw up the wine. Sid stepped 
in and made her stop, which I think 
he’d been wanting to do all along. 

CHAPTER 5 

Whenever I take up a news- 
paper and read it, I fancy I see 
ghosts creeping between the 
lines. There must be ghosts all 
over the world. They must be 
as countless as the grains of the 
sands, it seems to me. 

— Ibsen 

SID INSISTS ON 
GHOSTGIRLS 

Tl/TY Elizabethan boy friend put 
his fists on his hips and laid 
down the law to us as if we were 
a lot of nervous children who’d 
been playing too hard. 

“Look you, masters, this is a Re- 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




cuperation Station and I am run- 
ning it as such. A plague of all 
operations! I care not if the frame 
of things disjoints and the whole 
Change World goes to ruin, but 
you, warrior maid, are going to 
rest and drink more wine slowly 
before you tell your tale and your 
colleagues are going to be properly 
companioned. No questions, any- 
one. Beau, and you love us, give 
us a lively tune.” 

Kaby relaxed a little and let 
him put his hand carefully against 
her back in token of support and 
she said grudgingly, “All right, Fat 
Belly.” 

Theh, so help me, to the tune 
of the Muskrat Ramble, which I’d 
taught Beau, we got girls for those 
two ETs and everybody properly 
paired up. 

Right here I want to point out 
that a lot of the things they say 
in the Change World about Recu- 
peration Stations simply aren’t so 
—and anyway they always leave 
out nine-tenths of it. The Soldiers 
that come through the Door are 
looking for a good time, sure, but 
they’re hurt real bad too, every 
one of them, deep down in their 
minds and hearts, if not always in 
their bodies or so you can see it 
right away. 

Believe me, a temporal opera- 
tion is no joke, and to start with, 
there isn’t one person in a hundred 
who can endure to be cut from his 
lifeline and become a really wide- 



awake Doubleganger— a Demon, 
that is— let alone a Soldier. What 
does a badly hurt and mixed-up 
creature need who’s been fighting 
hard? One individual to look out 
for him and feel for him and patch 
him up, and it helps if the one is 
of the opposite sex— that’s some- 
thing that goes beyond species. 

There’s your basis for the Place 
and the wild way it goes about its 
work, and also for most other Re- 
cuperation Stations or Entertain- 
ment Spots. The name Entertainer 
can be misleading, but I like it 
She’s got to be a lot more than a 
good party girl— or boy— though 
she’s got to be that too. She's got 
to be a nurse and a psychologist 
and an actress and a mother and 
a practical ethnologist and a lot 
of things with longer names— and a 
reliable friend. 

TVTONE of us are all those things 
-*• ^ perfectly or even near it. We 
just try. But when the call comes, 
Entertainers have to forget grudges 
and gripes and envies and jeal- 
ousies— and remember, they’re live- 
ly people with sharp emotions— 
because there isn’t any time then 
for anything but help and don’t 
ask who! 

And, deep inside her, a good 
Entertainer doesn’t care who. Take 
the way it shaped up this time. 
It was pretty clear to me I ought 
to shift to Illy, although I wasn’t 
quite easy in my mind about leav- 



THE BIG TIME

ing Erich, because the Lunan was 
a long time from home and, after 
all, Erich was among anthropoids. 
Ilhilihis needed someone who was 
simpatico. 

I like Illy and not just because 
he is a sort of tall cross between 
a spider monkey and a persian cat 
—though that is a handsome com- 
bo when you come to think of it. 
I like him for himself. So when 
he came in all lopped and shaky 
after a mean operation, I was the 
right person to look out for him. 
Now I’ve made my little speech 
and know-nothings in the Change 
World can go on making their 
bum jokes. But I ask you, how 
could an arrangement between Illy 
and me be anything but Platonic? 

We might have had some octo- 
poid girls and nymphs in stock— 
Sid couldn’t be sure until he 
checked— but Ilhilihis and Seven- 
see voted for real people and I 
knew Sid saw it their way. Maud 
squeezed Mark’s hand and tripped 
over to Sevensee (“Those are 
sharp hoofs you got, man”— she’s 
picked up some of my language, 
like she has everything else), 
though Beau did frown over his 
shoulder at Lili from the piano, 
maybe to argue that she ought to 
take on the ET, as Mark had been 
a real casualty and could use live 
nursing. But it was plain as day 
to anybody but Beau that Bruce 
and Lili were a big thing and the 
last to be disturbed. 



Erich acted stiffly hurt at losing 
me, but I knew he wasn’t He 
thinks he has a great technique with 
Ghostgirls and he likes to show 
it off, and he really is pretty slick 
at it, if you go for that sort of 
thing and — yang my yin! — who 
doesn’t at times? 

And when Sid formally wafted 
the Countess out of Stores— a real 
blonde stunner in a white satin 
hobble skirt with a white egret 
swaying up from her tiny hat, way 
ahead of Maud and Lili and me 
when it came to looks, though 
transparent as cigarette smoke — 
and when Erich clicked his heels 
and bowed over her hand and 
proudly conducted her to a couch, 
black Svengali to her Trilby, and 
started to German-talk some life 
into her with much head cocking 
and toothy smiling and a flow of 
witty flattery, and when she be- 
gan to flirt back and the dream 
look in her eyes sharpened hun- 
grily and focused on him — well, 
then I knew that Erich was happy 
and felt he was doing proud by the 
Reichswehr. No, my little com- 
mandant wasn’t worrying me on 
that score. 

M ARK had drawn a Greek 
hetaera name of Phryne; I 
suppose not the one who maybe 
still does the famous courtroom 
striptease back in Athens, and he 
was waking her up with little sips 
of his scotch and soda, though,

from some looks he’d flashed, I 
got the idea Kaby was the kid he 
really went for. Sid was coaxing 
the fighting gal to take some high- 
energy bread and olives along with 
the wine, and, for a wonder, Doc 
seemed to be carrying on an ani- 
mated and rational conversation 
with Sevensee and Maud, maybe 
comparing notes on the Northern 
Venusian Shallows, and Beau had 
got on to Panther Rag, and Bruce 
and Lili were leaning on the piano, 
smiling very appreciatively, but 
talking to each other a mile a 
minute. 

Illy turned back from inspecting 
them all and squeaked, “Animals 
with clothes are so refreshing, dah- 
ling! Like you’re all carrying ban- 
ners!” 

Maybe he had something there, 
though my banners were kind of 
Ash Wednesday, a charcoal gray 
sweater and skirt. He looked at 
my mouth with a tentacle to see 
how I was smiling and he squeaked 
softly, “Do I seem dull and com- 
monplace to you, Greta girl, be- 
cause I haven’t got banners? Just 
another Zombie from a billion 
years in your past, as gray and 
lifeless as Luna is today, not as 
when she was a real dreamy sis- 
ter planet simply bursting with air 
and water and feather forests. Or 
am I as strangely interesting to 
you as you are to me, girl from a 
billion years in my future?” 

“Illy, you’re sweet,” I told him, 



giving him a little pat I noticed 
his fur was still vibrating nervous- 
ly and I decided the heck with 
Sid’s orders, I’m going to pump 
him about what he was doing with 
Kaby and the satyr. Couldn’t have 
him a billion years from home and 
bottled up, too. Besides, I was 
curious. 

CHAPTER 6 

Maiden, Nymph, and Mother 
are the eternal royal Trinity of 
the island, and the Goddess, who 
is worshipped there in each of 
these aspects, as New Moon, 
Full Moon, and Old Moon, is 
the sovereign Deity. 

— Graves 

CRETE CIRCA 1300 B.C. 

ABY pushed back at Sid some 
seconds of bread and olives, 
and, when he raised his bushy eye- 
brows, gave him a curt nod that 
meant she knew what she was do- 
ing. She stood up and sort of took 
a position. All the talk quieted 
down fast, even Bruce’s and Lili’s. 
Kaby’s face and voice weren’t 
strained now, but they weren’t re- 
laxed either. 

“Woe to Spider! Woe to Cretan! 
Heavy is the news I bring you. 
Bear it bravely, like strong wom- 
en. When we got the gun un- 
limbered, I heard seaweed fry and 
crackle. We three leaped behind 
the rock wall, saw our gun grow 
white as sunlight in a heat-ray of

the Serpents! Natch, we feared we 
were outnumbered and I called 
upon my Caller.” 

I don’t know how she does it, 
but she does — in English too. 
That is, when she figures she’s got 
something important to report, and 
maybe she needs a little time to 
get ready. 

Beau claims that all the an- 
cients fit their thoughts into meas- 
ured lines as naturally as we pick 
a word that will do, but I’m not 
sure how good the Vicksburg lan- 
guage department is. Though why 
I should wonder about things like 
that when I’ve got Kaby spout- 
ing the stuff right in front of me, 
I don’t know. 

“But I didn’t die there, kiddos. 
I still hoped to hurt the Greek 
ships L maybe with the Snake’s own 
heat gun. So I quick tried to out- 
flank them. My two comrades 
crawled beside me— they are males, 
but they have courage. Soon we 
spied the ambush-setters. They 
were Snakes and they were many, 
filthily disguised as Cretans.” 



There was an indignant mur- 
mur at this, for our cutthroat 
Change War has its code, the Sol- 
diers tell me. Being an Enter- 
tainer, I don’t have to say what 
I think. 

“They had seen us when we 
saw them,” Kaby swept on, “and 
they loosed a killing volley. Heat- 
and knife-rays struck about us in 
a storm of wind and fire, and the 
Lunan lost a feeler, fighting for 
Crete’s Triple Goddess. So we 
dodged behind a sand hill, steered 
our flight back toward the water. 
It was awful, what we saw there: 
Crete’s brave ships all sunk or 
sinking, blue sky sullied by their 
death-smoke. Once again the 
Greeks had licked us! — aided by 
the filthy Serpents.

“Round our wrecks, their black 
ships scurried, like black beetles, 
filth their diet, yet this day they 
dine on heroes. On the quiet sun- 
lit beach there, I could feel a 
Change Gale blowing, working 
changes deep inside me, aches and 
pains that were a stranger’s. Half 
my memories were doubled, half 
my lifeline crooked and twisted, 
three new moles upon my sword- 
hand. Goddess, Goddess, Triple 
Goddess—” 

TIER voice wavered and Sid 
reached out a hand, but she 
straightened her back. 

“Triple Goddess, give me courage 
to tell everything that happened. 
We ran down into the water, hop- 
ing to escape by diving. We had 
hardly gotten under when the heat- 
rays hit above us, turning all the 
cool green surface to a roaring 
white inferno. But as I believe I 
told you, I was calling on my 
Caller, and a Door now opened to 
us, deep below the deadly steam- 
clouds. We dived in like frightened 
minnows and a lot of water with 
us.” 

Off Chicago’s Gold Coast, Dave 
once gave me a lesson in skin- 
diving and, remembering it, I got 
a flash of Kaby’s Door in the dark 
depths. 

“For a moment, all was chaos. 
Then the Door slammed shut be- 
hind us. We’d been picked up in 
time’s nick by— an Express Room 



of our Spiders!— sloshing two feet 
deep in water, much more cramped 
for space than this Place. It was 
manned by a magician, an old coot 
named Benson-Carter. He dispelled 
the water quickly and reported on 
his Caller. We’d got dry, were 
feeling human, Illy here had shed 
his swimsuit, when we looked at 
the Maintainer. It was glowing, 
changing, melting! And when Ben- 
son-Carter touched it, he fell back- 
ward-death was in him. Then 
the Void began to darken, narrow, 
shrink and close around us, so I 
called upon my Caller— without 
wasting time, let me tell you! 

“We can’t say for sure what was 
it slowly squeezed that sweet Ex- 
press Room, but we fear the dirty 
Snakes have found a way to find 
our Places and attack outside the 
cosmos!— found the Spiderweb that 
links us in the Void’s gray less- 
than-nothing.” 

No murmur this time. This reac- 
tion was genuine; we’d been hit 
where we lived and I could see 
everybody was scared as sick as 
I was. Except maybe Bruce and 
Lili, who were still holding hands 
and beaming gently. I decided they 
were the kind that love makes 
brave, which it doesn’t do to me. 
It just gives me two people to 
worry about. 

“I can see you dig our feel- 
ings,” Kaby continued. “This thing 
scared the pants off of us. If we 
could have, we’d have even Intro-

verted the Maintained broken all 
the ties that bind us, chanced it 
incommunicado. But the little old 
Maintainer was a seething red- 
hot puddle filled with bubbles big 
as handballs. We sat tight and 
watched the Void close. I kept 
calling on my Caller ” 

¥ SQUEEZED my eyes shut, but 
that made it easier to see the 
three of them with the Void shut- 
ting down on them. (Was ours 
still behaving? Yes, Bibi Miriam.) 
Poetry or no poetry, it got me. 

“Benson-Carter, lying dying, 
also thought the Snakes had done 
it. And he knew that death was 
in him, so he whispered me his 
mission, giving me precise instruc- 
tions: how to press the seven 
death’s hands, starting lockside 
counterclockwise, one, three, five, 
six, two, four, seven, then you have 
a half an hour; after you have 
pressed the seven, do not mon- 
key with the buttons— get out fast 
and don’t stop moving.” 

I wasn’t getting this part and I 
couldn’t see that anyone else was, 
though Bruce was whispering to 
Lili. I remembered seeing skulls 
engraved on the bronze chest. I 
looked at Illy and he nodded a 
tentacle and spread two to say, I 
guessed, that yes, Benson-Carter 
had said something like that, but 
no, Illy didn’t know much about 
it. 

“All these things and more he 



whispered,” Kaby went on, “with 
the last gasps of his life-force, tell- 
ing all his secret orders— for he’d 
not been sent to get us, he was 
on a separate mission, when he 
heard my SOSs. Sid, it’s you he 
was to contact, as the first leg of 
his mission, pick up from you 
three black hussars, death’s-head 
Demons, daring Soldiers, then to 
wait until the Places next match 
rhythm with the cosmos— matter of 
two mealtimes, barely— and to time 
in northern Egypt in the age of the 
last Caesar, in the year of Rome’s 
swift downfall, there to start an 
operation in a battle near a city 
named for Thrace’s Alexander, 
there to change the course of battle, 
blow sky-high the stinking Ser- 
pents, all their agents, all their 
Zombies! 

“Goddess, pardon, now I savvy 
how you’ve guided my least foot- 
step, when I thought you’d gone 
and left me— for I flubbed your 
three-mole signal. We’ve found 
Sid’s Place, that’s the first leg, and 
I see the three black hussars, and 
we’ve brought with us the weapon 
and the Parthian disguises, sal- 
vaged from the doomed Express 
Room when your Door appeared 
in time’s nick, and the Room around 
us closing spewed us through before 
it vanished with the corpse of Ben- 
son-Carter. Triple Goddess, draw

upon the Serpents, vengeance 
sweet in northern Egypt, for your 
island, Crete, Goddess!— and a vic- 
tory for the Spiders! Goddess, 
Goddess, we can swing it!* 

The roar that made me try to 
stop my ears with my shoulders 
didn’t come from Kaby — she’d 
spoken her piece — but from Sid. 
The dear boy was purple enough 
to make me want to remind him 
you can die of high blood pressure 
just as easy in the Change World. 

“Dump me with ops! ’Sblood, 
I’ll not endure it! Is this a battle 
post? They'll be mounting opera- 
tions from field hospitals next. 
Kabysia Labrys, thou art mad to 
suggest it. And what’s this prattle 
of locks, clocks, and death’s heads, 
buttons and monkeys? This brab- 
ble, this farrago, this hocus-pocus! 
And where’s the weapon you prate 
of? In that whoreson bronze cas- 
ket, I suppose.” 

She nodded, looking blank and 
almost a little shy as poetic pos- 
session faded from her. Her an- 
swer came like its faltering last 
echo. 

“It is nothing but a tiny tacti- 
cal atomic bomb.” 

CHAPTER 7 

After about 0.1 millisecond (one 
ten-thousandth part of a second) 
has elapsed, the radius of the 
ball of fire is some 45 feet, and 
the temperature is then in the 
vicinity of 300,000 degrees Cen- 



tigrade. At this instant, the lu- 
minosity, as observed at a dis- 
tance of 100,000 yards (5.7 
miles), is approximately 100 
times that of the sun as seen at 
the earth’s surface. the ball 
of fire expands very rapidly to 
its maximum radius of 450 feet 
within less than a second from 
the explosion. 

—Los Alamos 
TIME TO THINK 

T>ROTHER, that was all we 
needed to make everybody 
but Kaby and the two ETs start 
yelping at once, me included. It 
may seem strange that Change 
People, able to whiz through time 
and space and roust around out- 
side the cosmos and knowing at 
least by hearsay of weapons a bil- 
lion years in the future, like the 
Mind bo mb, should panic at be- 
ing shut in with a little primitive 
mid-20th Century gadget Well, 
they feel the same as atomic scien- 
tists would feel if a Bengal tiger 
were brought into their laboratory, 
neither more nor less scared. 

I’m a moron at physics, but I 
do know the Fireball is bigger than 
the Place. Remember that, besides 
the bomb, we’d recently been pre- 
sented with a lot of other fears we 
hadn’t had time to cope with, es- 
pecially the business of the Snakes 
having learned how to get at our 
Places and melt the Maintainers 
and collapse them. Not to mention

the general impression — first Saint 
Petersburg, then Crete — that the 
whole Change War was going 
against the Spiders. 

Yet, in a free corner of my 
mind, I was shocked at how badly 
we were all panicking. It made 
me admit what I didn’t like to: 
that we were all in pretty much 
the same state as Doc, except that 
the bottle didn’t happen to be our 
out. 

And had the rest of us been 
controlling our drinking so well 
lately? 

Maud yelled, “Jettison it!” and 
pulled away from the satyr and 
ran from the bronze chest. Beau, 
harking back to what they’d 
thought of doing in the Express 
Room when it was too late, hissed, 
“Sirs, we must Introvert,” and 
vaulted over the piano bench and 
legged it for the control divan. 
Erich seconded him with a white- 
faced “Gott in Himmel, ja!” from 
beside the surly, forgotten Count- 
ess, holding, by its slim stem, an 
empty, rose-stained wine glass. 

I felt my mind flinch, because 
Introverting a Place is several de- 
grees worse than foxholing. It’s 
supposed not only to keep the 
Door tight shut, but also to lock 
it so even the Change Winds can’t 
get through— cut the Place loose 
from the cosmos altogether. 

I’d never talked with anyone 
from a Place that had been Intro- 
verted. 



"lyTARK dumped Phryne off his 
lap and ran after Maud. The 
Greek Ghostgirl, quite solid now, 
looked around with sleepy fear 
and fumbled her apple-green 
chiton together at the throat. She 
wrenched my attention away from 
everyone else for a moment, and 
I couldn’t help wondering whether 
the person or Zombie back in the 
cosmos, from whose lifeline the 
Ghost has been taken, doesn’t at 
least have strange dreams or 
thoughts when something like this 
happens. 

Sid stopped Beau, though he al- 
most got bowled over doing it, and 
he held the gambler away from 
the Maintainer in a bear hug and 
bellowed over his shoulders, 
“Masters, are you mad? Have you 
lost your wits? Maud! Mark! Mar- 
cus! Magdalene! On your lives, un- 
hand that casket!” 

Maud had swept the clothes 
and bows and quivers and stuff 
off it and was dragging it out from 
the bar toward the Door sector, 
so as to dump it through fast when 
we got one, I guess, while Mark 
acted as if he were trying to help 
her and wrestle it away from her 
at the same time. 

They kept on as if they hadn’t 
heard a word Sid said, with Mark 
yelling, “Let go, meretrix! This 
holds Rome’s answer to Parthia 
on the Nile.” 

Kaby watched them as if she 
wanted to help Mark but scorned

to scuffle with a mere — well, 
Mark had said it in Latin, I guess 
—call girl. 

Then, on the top of the bronze 
chest, I saw those seven lousy 
skulls starting at the lock as plain 
as if they’d been under a magni- 
fying glass, though ordinarily 
they’d have been a vague circle 
to my eyes at the distance, and I 
lost my mind and started to run 
in the opposite direction, but Illy 
whipped three tentacles around 
me, gentle-like, and squeaked, 
“Easy now, Greta girl, don’t you 
be doing it, too. Hold still or Papa 
spank. My, my, but you two-leg- 
gers can whirl about when you 
have a mind to.” 

My stampede had carried his 
featherweight body a couple of 
yards, but it stopped me and I 
got my mind back, partly. 

“Unhand it, I say!” Sid repeated 
without accomplishing anything, 
and he released Beau, though he 
kept a hand near the gambler’s 
shoulder. 

Then my fat friend from Lynn 
Regis looked real distraught at 
the Void and blustered at no one 
in particular, “ ‘Sdeath, think you 
I’d mutiny against my masters, 
desert the Spiders, go to ground 
like a spent fox and pull my hole 
in after me? A plague of such 
cowardice! Who suggests it? In- 
troversion’s no mere last-ditch de- 
vice. Unless ordered, supervised 
and sanctioned, it means the end. 



And what if I’d Introverted ’ere 
we got Kaby’s call for succor, 
hey?” 

TTIS warrior maid nodded with 
harsh approval and he no- 
ticed it and shook his free hand at 
her and scolded her, “Not that I 
say yea to your mad plan for that 
Devil’s casket, you half-clad lack- 
wit. And yet to jettison . Oh, ye 
gods, ye gods—” he wiped his hand 
across his face— “grant me a minute 
in which I may think!” 

Thinking time wasn’t an item 
even on the strictly limited list 
at the moment, although Sevensee, 
squatting dourly on his hairy 
haunches where Maud had left 
him, threw in a dead-pan “Thas 
tellin em, Gov.” 

Then Doc at the bar stood up 
tall as Abe Lincoln in his top hat 
and shawl and 19th Century duds 
and raised an unwavering arm for 
silence and said something that 
sounded like: “Introversh, inversh, 
glovsh,” and then his enunciation- 
switched to better than perfect as 
he continued, “I know to an abso- 
lute certainty what we must do.” 

It showed me how rabbity we 
were that the Place got quiet as a 
church while we all stopped what- 
ever we were doing and waited 
breathless for a poor drunk to 
tell us how to save ourselves. 

He said something like, “In- 
versh . bosh ...” and held our 
eyes for a moment longer. Then

the light went out of his and he 
slobbered out a “Nichevo” and 
slid an arm far along the bar for 
a bottle and started to pour it 
down his throat without stopping 
sliding. 

Before he completed his col- 
lapse to the floor, in the split sec- 
ond while our attention was still 
focused on the bar, Bruce vaulted 
up on top of it, so fast it was al- 
most like he’d popped up from 
nowhere, though I’d seen him start 
from behind the piano. 

“I’ve a question. Has anyone 
here triggered that bomb?” he said 
in a voice that was very clear and 
just loud enough. “So it can’t go 
off,” he went on after just the 
right pause, his easy grin and brisk 
manner putting more heart into me 
all the time. “What’s more, if it 
were to be triggered, we’d still have 
half an hour. I believe you said 
it had that long a fuse?” 

He stabbed a finger at Kaby. 
She nodded. 

“Right,” he said. “It’d have to 
be that long for whoever plants it 
in the Parthian camp to get away. 
There’s another safety margin. 

“Second question. Is there a 
locksmith in the house?” 

T^OR all Bruce’s easiness, he was 
watching us like a golden eagle 
and he caught Beau’s and Maud’s 
affirmatives before they had a 
chance to explain or hedge them 
and said, “That’s very good. Under 



certain circumstances, you two’d 
be the ones to go to work on the 
chest But before we consider that, 
there’s Question Three: Is any- 
one here an atomics technician?” 
That one took a little conversa- 
tion to straighten out, Illy having 
to explain that, yes, the Early Lu- 
nans had atomic power — hadn’t 
they blasted the life off their planet 
with it and made all those ghastly 
craters?— but no, he wasn’t a tech- 
nician exactly, he was a “thinger” 
(I thought at first his squeakbox 
was lisping); what was a thinger? 
—well, a thinger was someone who 
manipulated things in a way that 
was truly impossible to describe, 
but no, you couldn’t possibly thing 
atomics; the idea was quite ridicu- 
lous, so he couldn’t be an atomics 
thinger; the term was worse than 
a contradiction, well, really!— while 
Sevensee, from his two-thousand- 
millennia advantage of the Lunan, 
grunted to the effect that his cul- 
ture didn’t rightly use any kind 
of power, but just sort of moved 
satyrs and stuff by wrastling space- 
time around, “or think em roun ef 
we hafta. Can’t think em in the 
Void, tho, wus luck. Hafta have— 
I dunno wut. Dun hawit anyhow.” 
“So we don’t have an A-tech,” 
Bruce summed up, “which makes it 
worse than useless, downright dan- 
gerous, to tamper with the chest. 
We wouldn’t know what to do if 
we did get inside safely. One more 
question.” He directed it toward 



THE BIG TIME 



45 




Sid. “How long before we can jet- 
tison anything?” 

Sid, looking a shade jealous, yet 
mostly grateful for the way Bruce 
had calmed his chickens, started to 
explain, but Bruce didn’t seem to 
be taking any chance of losing his 
audience, and as soon as Sid got 
to the word “rhythm,” he pulled 
the answer away from him. 

“In brief, not until we can ef- 
fectively tune in on the cosmos 
again. Thank you, Master Lessing- 
ham. That’s at least five hours— 
two mealtimes, as the Cretan offi- 
cer put it,” and he threw Kaby a 
quick soldierly smile. “So, whether 
the bomb goes to Egypt or else- 
where, there’s not a thing we can 
do about it for five hours. All right 
then!” 

His smile blinked out like a 
light and he took a couple of steps 
up and down the bar, as if measur- 
ing the space he had. Two or three 
cocktail glasses sailed off and 
popped, but he didn’t seem to no- 
tice them and we hardly did either. 
It was creepy the way he kept 
staring from one to another of us. 
We had to look up. Behind his 
face, with the straight golden hair 
flirting around it, was only the 
Void. 

“All right then,” he repeated sud- 
denly. “We’re twelve Spiders and 
two Ghosts, and we’ve time for a 
bit of a talk, and we’re all in the 
same bloody boat, fighting the 
same bloody war, so we’ll all know 



what we’re talking about I raised 
the subject a while back, but I 
was steamed up about a glove, and 
it was a big jest. All right! But 
now the gloves are off!” 

T>RUCE ripped them out of his 
belt where they’d been tucked 
and slammed them down on the 
bar, to be kicked off the next time 
he paced back and forth, and it 
wasn’t funny. 

“Because,” he went right on, 
“I’ve been getting a completely 
new picture of what this Spiders’ 
war has been doing to each one 
of us. Oh, it’s jolly good sport to 
slam around in space and time and 
then have a rugged little party 
outside both of them when the 
operation’s over. It’s sweet to know 
there’s no cranny of reality so nar- 
row, no privacy so intimate or 
sacred, no wall of was or will be 
strong enough, that we can’t shoul- 
der in. Knowledge is a glamorous 
thing, sweeter than lust or glut- 
tony or the passion of fighting and 
including all three, the ultimate 
insatiable hunger, and it’s great 
to be Faust, even in a pack of 
other Fausts. 

“It’s sweet to jigger reality, to 
twist the whole course of a man’s 
life or a culture’s, to ink out his 
or its past and scribble in a new 
one, and be the only one to know 
and gloat over the changes— hah! 
killing men or carrying off women 
isn’t in it for glutting the sense of

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




power. It’s sweet to feel the Change 
Winds blowing through you and 
know the pasts that were and the 
past that is and the pasts that may 
be. It’s sweet to wield the Atropos 
and cut a Zombie or Unborn out 
of his lifeline and look the Double- 
ganger in the face and see the 
Resurrection-glow in it and Recruit 
a brother, welcome a newborn fel- 
low Demon into our ranks and de- 
cide whether hell best fit as Sol- 
dier, Entertainer, or what. 

“Or he can’t stand Resurrection, 
it fries or freezes him, and you’ve 
got to decide whether to return 
him to his lifeline and his Zombie 
dreams, only they’ll be a little 
grayer and horrider than they were 
before, or whether, if she’s got that 
tantalizing something, to bring her 
shell along for a Ghostgirl— that’s 
sweet, too. It’s even sweet to have 
Change Death poised over your 
neck, to know that the past isn’t 
the precious indestructible thing 
you’ve been taught it was, to know 
that there’s no certainty about the 
future either, whether there’ll even 
be one, to know that no part of 
reality is holy, that the cosmos itself 
may wink out like a flicked switch 
and God be not and nothing left 
but nothing!” 

He threw out his arms against 
the Void. “And knowing all that, 
it’s doubly sweet to come through 
the Door into the Place ^nd be 
out of the worst of the Change 
Winds and enjoy a well-earned 



Recuperation and share the memo- 
ries of all these sweetnesses I’ve 
been talking about, and work out 
all the fascinating feelings you’ve 
been accumulating back in the cos- 
mos, layer by black layer, in the 
company of and with the help of 
the best bloody little band of fel- 
low Fausts and Faustines going! 

“Oh, it’s a sweet life, all right, but 
I’m asking you—” and here his eyes 
stabbed us again, one by one, fast 
—“I’m asking you what it’s done 
to us. I’ve been getting a complete- 
ly new picture, as I said, of what 
my life was and what it could have 
been if there’d been changes of the 
sort that even we Demons can’t 
make, and what my life is. I’ve 
been watching how we’ve all been 
responding to things just now, to 
the news of Saint Petersburg and 
to what the Cretan officer told 
beautifully— only it wasn’t beauti- 
ful what she had to tell— and most- 
ly to that bloody box of bomb. 
And I’m simply asking each one 
of you, what’s happened to you?” 

TJTE stopped his pacing and 
stuck his thumbs in his belt 
and seemed to be listening to the 
wheels turning in at least eleven 
other heads— only I stopped mine 
pretty quick, with Dave and 
Father and the Rape of Chicago 
coming up out of the dark on the 
turn and Mother and the Indiana 
Dunes and Jazz Limited just be- 
hind them, followed by the un- 



THE BIG TIME

thinkable thing the Spider doctor 
had flicked into existence when I 
flopped as a nurse, because I can’t 
stand that to be done to my mind 
by anybody but myself. 

I stopped them by using the old 
infallible Entertainers’ gimmick, a 
fast survey of the most interesting 
topic there is — other people’s 
troubles. 

/~\FFHAND, Beau looked as if he 
^ had most troubles, shamed 
by his boss and his girl given her 
heart to a Soldier; he was hug- 
ging them to himself very quiet. 

I didn’t stop for the two ETs— 
they’re too hard to figure— or for 
Doc; nobody can tell whether a 
fallen-down drunk’s at the black 
or bright end of his cycle; you 
just know it’s cycling. 

Maud ought to be suffering as 
much as Beau, called names and 
caught out in a panic, which al- 
ways hurts her because she’s plus 
three hundred years more future 
than the rest of us and figures she 
ought to be that much wiser, which 
she isn’t always— not to mention 
she’s over fifty years old, though 
her home-century cosmetic science 
keeps her looking and acting teen- 
age most of the time. She’d backed 
away from the bronze chest so as 
not to stand out, and now Lili came 
from behind the piano and stood 
beside her. 

Lili had the opposite of troubles, 
a great big glow for Bruce, proud 



as a promised princess watching 
her betrothed. Erich frowned when 
he saw her, for he seemed proud 
too, proud of the way his Kamerad 
had taken command of us panicky 
whacks Fu/irer-fashion. Sid still 
looked mostly grateful and inclined 
to let Bruce keep on talking. 

Even Kaby and Mark, those 
two dragons hot for battle, stand- 
ing a little in front and to one side 
of us by the bronze chest, like its 
guardians, seemed willing to listen. 
They made me realize one reason 
Sid had for letting Bruce run on, 
although the path his talk was lead- 
ing us down was flashing with dan- 
ger signals : When it was over, 
there’d still be the problem of what 
to do with the bomb, and a real 
opposition shaping up between Sol- 
diers and Entertainers, and Sid 
was hoping a solution would turn 
up in the meantime or at least was 
willing to put off the evil day. 

But beyond all that, and like the 
rest of us, I could tell from the 
way Sid was squinting his browy 
eyes and chewing his beardy lip 
that he was shaken and moved by 
what Bruce had said. This New 
Boy had dipped into our hearts 
and counted our kicks so beauti- 
fully, better than most of us could 
have done, and then somehow 
turned them around so that we had 
to think of what messes and heels 
and black sheep and lost lambs 
we were — well, we wanted to keep 
on listening.

CHAPTER 8 
Give me a place to stand, 
and I will move the world. 

— Archimedes 
A PLACE TO STAND 

"DRUCE’S voice had a faraway 
touch and he was looking up 
left at the Void as he said, “Have 
you ever really wondered why the 
two sides of this war are called 
the Snakes and the Spiders? 
Snakes may be clear enough— you 
always call the enemy something 
dirty. But Spiders— our name for 
ourselves? Bear with me, Ilhilihis; 
I know that no being is created 
dirty or malignant by Nature, but 
this is a matter of anthropoid feel- 
ings and folkways. Yes, Mark, I 
know that some of your legions 
have nicknames like the Drunken 
Lions and the Snails, and that’s 
about as insulting as calling the 
British Expeditionary Force the 
Old Contemptibles. 

“No, you’d have to go to bands 
of vicious youths in cities slated 
for ruin to find a habit of naming 
like ours, and even they would try 
to brighten up the black a bit. 
But simply— Spiders. And Snakes, 
for that’s their name for themselves 
too, you know. Spiders and Snakes. 
What are our masters, that we give 
them names like that?” 

It gave me the shivers and set 
my mind working in a dozen direc- 
tions and I couldn’t stop it, al- 
though it made the shivers worse. 



Illy beside me now— I’d never 
given it a thought before, but he 
did have eight legs of a sort, and 
I remembered thinking of him as 
a spider monkey, and hadn’t the 
Lunans had wisdom and atomic 
power and a billion years in which 
to get the Change War rolling? 

Or suppose, in the far future, 
Terra’s own spiders evolved intel- 
ligence and a cruel cannibal cul- 
ture. They’d be able to keep their 
existence secret. I had no idea of 
who or what would be on Earth 
in Sevensee’s day, and wouldn’t 
it be perfect black hairy poisoned 
spider-mentality to spin webs se- 
cretly through the world of thought 
and all of space and time? 

And Beau — wasn’t there some- 
thing real Snaky about him, the 
way he moved and all? 

Spiders and Snakes. Spinne und 
Schlange, as Erich called them. 
S fie S. But SS stood for the Nazi 
Schutzstaffel, the Black Shirts, and 
what if some of those cruel, crazy 
Jerries had discovered time travel 
and — I brought myself up with 
a jerk and asked myself, “Greta, 
how nuts can you get?” 

t^ROM where he was on the 

floor, the front of the bar his 
sounding board, Doc shrieked up 
at Bruce like one of the damned 
from the pit, “Don’t speak against 
the Spiders! Don’t blaspheme! 
They can hear the Unborn whis- 
per. Others whip only the skin, but 



THE BIG TIME 



49 




they whip the naked brain and 
heart,” and Erich called out, 
“That’s enough, Bruce!” 

But Bruce didn’t spare him a 
look and said, “But whatever the 
Spiders are and no matter how 
much whip they use, it’s plain as 
the telltale on the Maintainer that 
the Change War is not only going 
against them, but getting away 
from them. Dwell for a bit on the 
current flurry of stupid slugging 
and panicky anachronism, when 
we all know that anachronism is 
what gets the Change Winds out 
of control. This punchdrunk 
pounding on the Cretan-Dorian 
fracas as if it were the only battle 
going and the only way to work 
things. Whisking Constantine from 
Britain to the Bosporus by rocket, 
sending a pocket submarine back 
to sail with the Armada against 
Drake’s woodensides — I’ll wager 
you hadn’t heard those! And now, 
to save Rome, an atomic bomb. 

“Ye gods, they could have used 
Greek fire or even dynamite, but 
a fission weapon ... I leave you 
to imagine what gaps and scars 
that will make in what’s left of his- 
tory — the smothering of Greece 
and the vanishment of Provence 
and the troubadours and the Papa- 
cy’s Irish Captivity won’t be in it!” 
The cut on his cheek had 
opened again and was oozing a 
little, but he didn’t pay any at- 
tention to it, and neither did we, as 
his lips thinned in irony and he 



said, “But I’m forgetting that this 
is a cosmic war and that the 
Spiders are conducting operations 
on billions, trillions of planets and 
inhabited gas clouds through mil- 
lions of ages and that we’re just 
one little world— one little solar 
system, Sevensee— and we can hard- 
ly expect our inscrutable masters, 
with all their pressing preoccupa- 
tions and far-flung responsibilities, 
to be especially understanding or 
tender in their treatment of our pet 
books and centuries, our favorite 
prophets and periods, or unduly 
concerned about preserving any of 
the trifles that we just happen to 
hold dear. 

“Perhaps there are some sen- 
timentalists who would rather die 
forever than go on living in a 
world without the Summa, the 
Field Equations, Process and 
Reality, Hamlet, Matthew, Keats, 
and the Odyssey, but our masters 
are practical creatures, minister- 
ing to the needs of those rugged 
souls who want to go on living 
no matter what” 

Tj 1 RICH’S “Bruce, I’m telling 
you that’s enough,” was lost 
in the quickening flow of the New 
Boy’s words. “I won’t spend much 
time on the minor signs of our 
major crack-up— the canceling of 
leaves, the sharper shortages, the 
loss of the Express Room, the use 
of Recuperation Stations for ops 
and all the other frantic patchwork

—last operation but one, we were 
saddled with three Soldiers from 
outside the Galaxy and, no fault 
of theirs, they were no earthly 
use. Such little things might hap- 
pen at a bad spot in any war and 
are perhaps only local. But there’s 
a big thing.” 

He paused again, to let us won- 
der, I guess. Maud must have 
worked her way over to me, for I 
felt her dry little hand on my 
arm and she whispered out of the 
side of her mouth, “What do we 
do now?” 

“We listen,” I told her the same 
way. I felt a little impatient with 
her need to be doing something 
about things. 

She cocked a gold-dusted eye- 
brow at me and murmured, “You, 
too?” 

I didn’t get to ask her me, too, 
what? Crush on Bruce? Nuts!— 
because just then Bruce’s voice 
took up again in the faraway range. 

“Have you ever asked your- 
selves how many operations the 
fabric of history can stand before 
it’s all stitches, whether too much 
Change won’t one day wear out 
the past? And the present and the 
future, too, the whole bleeding 
business. Is the law of the Conser- 
vation of Reality any more than 
a thin hope given a long name, a 
prayer of theoreticians? Change 
Death is as certain as Heat Death, 
and far faster. Every operation 
leaves reality a bit cruder, a bit 



uglier, a bit more makeshift, and 
a whole lot less rich in those de- 
tails and feelings that are our 
heritage, like the crude penciled 
sketch on canvas when you’ve 
stripped off the paint. 

“If that goes on, won’t the cos- 
mos collapse into an outline of 
itself, then nothing? How much 
thinning can reality stand, having 
more and more Doublegangers cut 
out of it? And there’s another 
thing about every operation — it 
wakes up the Zombies a little more, 
and as its Change Winds die, it 
leaves them a little more disturbed 
and nightmare-ridden and frazzled. 
Those of you who have been on 
operations in heavily worked-over 
temporal areas will know what I 
mean— that look they give you out 
of the sides of their eyes as if to 
say, ‘You again? For Christ’s sake, 
go away. We’re the dead. We’re the 
ones who don’t want to wake up, 
who don’t want to be Demons and 
hate to be Ghosts. Stop torturing 
us.’” 

T LOOKED around at the Ghost- 
-*• girls; I couldn’t help it. They’d 
somehow got together on the con- 
trol divan, facing us, their backs 
to the Maintainers. The Countess 
had dragged along the bottle of 
wine Erich had fetched her earlier 
and they were passing it back and 
forth. The Countess had a big 
rose splotch across the ruffled 
white lace of her blouse. 



THE BIG TIME 



51 




Bruce said, “There’ll come a day 
when all the Zombies and all the 
Unborn wake up and go crazy to- 
gether and figuratively come 
marching at us in their num- 
berless hordes, saying, ‘We’ve had 
enough.’ ” 

But I didn’t turn back to Bruce 
right away. Phryne’s chiton had 
slipped off one shoulder and she 
and the Countess were sitting 
sagged forward, elbows on knees, 
legs spread— at least, as far as the 
Countess’s hobble skirt would let 
her— and swayed toward each other 
a little. They were still surpris- 
ingly solid, although they hadn’t 
had any personal attention for a 
half hour, and they were looking 
up over my head with half-shut 
eyes and they seemed, so help me, 
to be listening to what Bruce was 
saying and maybe hearing some of 
it 

“We make a careful distinction 
between Zombies and Unborn, be- 
tween those troubled by our oper- 
ations whose lifelines lie in the past 
and those whose lifelines lie in the 
future. But is there any distinc- 
tion any longer? Can we tell the 
difference between the past and 
the future? Can we any longer 
locate the now, the real now of the 
cosmos? The Places have their 
own nows, the now of the Big 
Time we’re on, but thafs different 
and it’s not made for real living. 

“The Spiders tell us that the 
real now is somewhere in the last 



half of the 20th Century, which 
means that several of us here are 
also alive in the cosmos, have life- 
lines along which the now is travel- 
ing. But do you swallow that story 
quite so easily, Ilhilihis, Sevensee? 
How does it strike the servants of 
the Triple Goddess? The Spiders 
of Octavian Rome? The Demons 
of Good Queen Bess? The gentle- 
men Zombies of the Greater 
South? Do the Unborn man the 
starships, Maud? 

“The Spiders also tell us that, 
although the fog of battle makes 
the now hard to pin down pre- 
cisely, it will return with the un- 
conditional surrender of the Snakes 
and the establishment of cosmic 
peace, and roll on as majestically 
toward the future as before, quick- 
ening the continuum with its pas- 
sage. Do you really believe that? 
Or do you believe, as I do, that 
we’ve used up all the future as 
well as the past, wasted it in pre- 
mature experience, and that we’ve 
had the real now smudged out of 
existence, stolen from us forever, 
the precious now of true growth, 
the child-moment in which all life 
lies, the moment like a newborn 
baby that is the only home for 
hope there is?” 

TTE let that start to sink in, 
then took a couple of quick 
steps and went on, his voice rising 
over Erich’s “Bruce, for the last 
time—” and seeming to pick up a 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




note of hope from the very word 
he had used, “But although things 
look terrifyingly black, there re- 
mains a chance — the slimmest 
chance, but still a chance — of 
saving the cosmos from Change 
Death and restoring reality’s rich- 
ness and giving the Ghosts good 
sleep and perhaps even regaining 
the real now. We have the means 
right at hand. What if the power 
of time traveling were used not 
for war and destruction, but for 
healing, for the mutual enrichment 
of the ages, for quiet communica- 
tion and growth, in brief, to bring 
a peace message—” 

But my little commandant is 
quite an actor himself and knows 
a wee bit about the principles of 
scene-stealing, and he was not go- 
ing to let Bruce drown him out 
as if he were just another extra 
playing a Voice from the Mob. 
He darted across our front, be- 
tween us and the bar, took a run- 
ning leap, and landed bang on the 
bloody box of bomb. 

A bit later, Maud was silently 
showing me the white ring above 
her elbow where I’d grabbed her 
and Illy was teasing a clutch of his 
tentacles out of my other hand 
and squeaking reproachfully, 
“Greta girl, don’t ever do that.” 
Erich was standing on the chest 
and I noticed that his boots care- 
fully straddled the circle of skulls, 
and I should have known anyway 
you could hardly push them in 



the right order by jumping on 
them, and he was pointing at 
Bruce and saying, “— and that 
means mutiny, my young sir. Urn 
Gottes willen, Bruce, listen to me 
and step down before you say 
anything worse. I’m older than 
you, Bruce. Mark’s older. Trust 
in your Kameraden. Guide your- 
self by their knowledge.” 

He had got my attention, but I 
had much rather have him black 
my eye. 

“You older than me?” Bruce 
was grinning. “When your twelve- 
years’ advantage was spent in 
soaking up the wisdom of a race 
of sadistic dreamers gone para- 
noid, in a world whose thought- 
stream had already been muddied 
by one total war? Mark older than 
me? When all his ideas and loyal- 
ties are those of a wolf pack of 
unimaginative sluggers two thou- 
sand years younger than I am? 
Either of you older because you 
have more of the killing cynicism 
that is all the wisdom the Change 
World ever gives you? Don’t make 
me laugh! 

“I’m an Englishman, and I come 
from an epoch when total war was 
still a desecration and the flowers 
and buds of thoughts not yet 
whacked off or blighted. I’m a 
poet and poets are wiser than any- 
one because they’re the only peo-

When I talk to all of you about a

peace message, I want you to think 
about it concretely in terms of 
using the Places to bring help 
across the mountains of time when 
help is really needed, not to bring 
help that’s undeserved or knowl- 
edge that’s premature or contami- 
nating, sometimes not to bring any- 
thing at all, but just to check with 
infinite tenderness and concern 
that everything’s safe and the 
glories of the universe unfolding 
as they were intended to—” 

“Yes, you are a poet, Bruce,” 
Erich broke in. “You can tootle 
soulfully on the flute and make 
us drip tears. You can let out the 
stops on the big organ pipes and 
make us tremble as if at Jehovah’s 
footsteps. For the last twenty 
minutes, you have been giving us 
some very charmante poetry. But 
what are you? An Entertainer? 
Or are you a Soldier?” 

R IGHT then — I don’t know 
what it was, maybe Sid clear- 
ing his throat — I could sense our 
feelings beginning to turn against 
Bruce. I got the strangest feeling 
of reality clamping down and 
bright colors going dull and dreams 
vanishing. Yet it was only then I 
also realized how much Bruce had 
moved us, maybe some of us to 
the verge of mutiny, even. I was 
mad at Erich for what he was 
doing, but I couldn’t help admiring 
his cockiness. 

I was still under the spell of 



Bruce’s words and the more-than- 
words behind them, but then 
Erich would shift around a bit and 
one of his heels would kick near 
the death’s-head pushbuttons and 
I wanted to stamp with spike heels 
on every death’s-head button on 
his uniform. I didn’t know exactly 
what I felt yet. 

“Yes, I’m a Soldier,” Bruce told 
him, “and I hope you won’t ever 
have to worry about my courage, 
because it’s going to take more 
courage than any operation we’ve 
ever planned, ever dreamed of, to 
carry the peace message to the 
other Places and to the wound- 
spots of the cosmos. Perhaps it will 
be a fast wicket and we’ll be 
bowled down before we score a 
single run, but who cares? We may 
at least see our real masters when 
they come to smash us, and for 
me that will be a deep satisfac- 
tion. And we may do some smash- 
ing of our own.” 

“So you’re a Soldier,” Erich 
said, his smile showing his teeth. 
“Bruce, I’ll admit that the half- 
dozen operations you’ve been on 
were rougher than anything I drew 
in my first hundred sleeps. For 
that, I am all honest sympathy. 
But that you should let them get 
you into such a state that love and 
a girl can turn you upside down 
and start you babbling about peace 
messages — ” 

“Yes, by God, love and a girl 
have changed me!” Bruce shouted

at him, and I looked around at Lili 
and I remembered Dave saying, 
“I’m going to Spain,” and I won- 
dered if anything would ever again 
make my face flame like that. “Or, 
rather, they’ve made me stand up 
for what I’ve believed in all along. 
They’ve made me — ” 

“Wurtderbar” Erich called and 
began to do a little sissy dance on 
the bomb that set my teeth on 
edge. He bent his wrists and el- 
bows at arty angles and stuck out 
a hip and ducked his head simper- 
ingly and blinked his eyes very 
fast. “Will you invite me to the 
wedding, Bruce? You’ll have to 
get another best man, but I will 
be the flower girl and throw pretty 
little posies to all the distinguished 
guests. Here, Mark. Catch, Kaby. 
One for you, Greta. Danke schon. 
Ach, zwei Herzen in dreivierteltakt 
. ta-ta . ta-ta . ta-ta-ta-ta- 
ta . ” 

“What the hell do you think a 
woman is?” Bruce raged. “Some- 
thing to mess around with in your 
spare time?” 

E RICH kept on humming “Two 
Hearts in Waltz Time” — and 
jigging around to it, damn him — 
but he slipped in a nod to Bruce 
and a “Precisely.” So I knew 
where I stood, but it was no news 
to me. 

“Very well,” Bruce said, “let’s 
leave this Brown Shirt maricon to 
amuse himself and get down to 



business. I made all of you a pro- 
posal and I don’t have to tell you 
how serious it is or how serious 
Lili and I are about it. We not only 
must infiltrate and subvert other 
Places, which luckily for us are 
made for infiltration, we also must 
make contact with the Snakes and 
establish working relationships with 
their Demons at our level as one 
of our first steps.” 

That stopped Erich’s jig and got 
enough of a gasp from some of us 
to make it seem to come from 
practically everybody. Erich used 
it to work a change of pace. 

“Bruce! We’ve let you carry 
this foolery further than we should. 
You seem to have the idea that 
because anything goes in the Place 
— dueling, drunkenness, tmd so 
weiter — you can say what you 
have and it will all be forgotten 
with the hangover. Not so. It is 
true that among such a set of 
monsters and free spirits as our- 
selves, and working as secret agents 
to boot, there cannot be the ob- 
vious military discipline that would 
obtain in a Terran army. 

“But let me tell you, Bruce, let 
me grind it home into you — Sid 
and Kaby and Mark will bear me 
out in this, as officers of equivalent 
rank — that the Spider line of 
command stretches into and 
through this Place just as surely 
as the word of der Fiihrer rules 
Chicago. And as I shouldn’t have 
to emphasize to you, Bruce, the 



THE BIG TIME 



55 




Spiders have punishments that 
would make my countrymen in 
Belsen and Buchenwald — well, 
pale a little. So while there is still 
a shadow of justification for our 
interpreting your remarks as utter- 
ly tasteless clowning — ” 

“Babble on,” Bruce said, giving 
him a loose downward wave of his 
hand without looking. “I made you 
people a proposal.” He paused. 
“How do you stand, Sidney Les- 
singham?” 

Then I felt my legs getting weak, 
because Sid didn't answer right 
away. The old boy swallowed and 
started to look around at the rest 
of us. Then the feeling of reality 
clamping down got something aw- 
ful, because he didn’t look around, 
but straightened his back a little. 
Just then, Mark cut in fast. 

“It grieves me, Bruce, but I 
think you are possessed. Erich, he 
must be confined.” 

ABY nodded, almost absently. 

“Confine or kill the coward, 
whichever is easier, whip the wo- 
man, and let’s get on to the Egyp- 
tian battle.” 

“Indeed, yes,” Mark said. “I 
died in it. But now perhaps no 
longer.” 

Kaby said to him, “I like you, 
Roman.” 

Bruce was smiling, barely, and 
his eyes were moving and fixing. 
“You, Ilhilihis?” 

lily’s squeak box had never 



sounded mechanical to me before, 
but it did as he answered, “I’m a 
lot deeper into borrowed time 
than the rest of you, tra-la-la, but 
Papa still loves living. Include me 
very much out, Brucie.” 

“Miss Davies?” 

Beside me, Maud said flatly, 
“Do you think I’m a fool?” Be- 
yond her, I saw Lili and I thought, 
“My God, I might look as proud 
if I were in her shoes, but I sure 
as hell wouldn't look as confident.” 

Bruce’s eyes hadn’t quite come 
to Beau when the gambler spoke 
up. “I have no cause to like you, 
sir, rather the opposite. But this 
Place has come to bore me more 
than Boston and I have always 
found it difficult to resist a long 
shot. A very long one, I fear. I am 
with you, sir.” 

There was a pain in my chest 
and a roaring in my ears and 
through it I heard Sevensee grunt- 
ing, “ — sicka these lousy Spiders. 
Deal me in.” 

And then Doc reared up in front 
of the bar and he’d lost his hat and 
his hair was wild and he grabbed 
an empty fifth by the neck and 
broke the bottom of it all jagged 
against the bar and he waved it 
and screeched, “Ubivaytye Pauki 
— i Nyemetzi!” 

And right behind his words, Beau 
sang out fast the English of it, 
“Kill the Spiders — and the Ger- 
mans!” 

And Doc didn’t collapse then, 



56

though I could see he was hanging 
onto the bar tight with his other 
hand, and the Place got stiller, 
inside and out, than I’ve ever 
known it, and Bruce’s eyes were 
finally moving back toward Sid. 

UT the eyes stopped short of 
Sid and I heard Bruce say, 
“Miss Forzane?” and I thought, 
“That’s funny,” and I started to 
look around at the Countess, and 
felt all the eyes and I realized, 
“Hey, that’s me! But this can’t 
happen to me. To the others, yes, 
but not to me. I just work here. 
Not to Greta, no, no, no!” 

But it had, and the eyes didn’t 
let go, and the silence and the feel- 
ing of reality were Godawful, and 
I said to myself, “Greta, you’ve 
got to say something, if only a 
suitable four-letter word,” and then 
suddenly I knew what the silence 
was like. It was like that of a big 
city if there were some way of 
shutting off all the noise in one 
second. It was like Erich’s singing 
when the piano had deserted him. 
It was as if the Change Winds 
should ever die completely . 
and I knew beforehand what had 
happened when I turned my back 
on them all. 

The Ghostgirls were gone. The 
Major Maintainer hadn’t merely 
been switched to Introvert. It was 
gone, too.

A S Paul Lambrequin was 
clambering up the stairs 
of his rooming house, he 
met a man whose face was all 
wrong. “Good evening,” Paul said 
politely and was about to con- 
tinue on his way when the man 
stopped him. 

“You are the first person I have 
encountered in this place who has

not shuttered at the sight of me,” 
he said in a toneless voice with 
an accent that was outside the 
standard repertoire. 

“Am I?” Paul asked, bringing 
himself back from one of the ro- 
seate dreams with which he kept 
himself insulated from a not-too- 
kind reality. “I daresay that’s be- 
cause I’m a bit near-sighted.” He

peered vaguely at the stranger. 
Then he recoiled. 

- “What is incorrect about me, 
then?” the stranger demanded. 
“Do I not have two eyes, one 
nose and one mouth, the identical 
as other people?” 

Paul studied the other man. 
“Yes, but somehow they seem to 
be put together all wrong. Not that 
you can help it, of course,” he 
added apologetically, for, when he 
thought of it, he hated to hurt peo- 
ple’s feelings. 

“Yes, I can, for, of a truth, ’twas 
I who put myself together. What 
did I do amiss?” 

Paul looked consideringly at 
him. “I can’t quite put my finger 
on it, but there are certain subtle 
nuances you just don’t seem to 
have caught. If you want my pro- 
fessional advice, you’ll model your- 
self directly on some real person 
until you’ve got the knack of im- 
provisation.” 

“Like unto this?” The stranger’s 
outline shimmered and blurred into 
an amorphous cloud, which then 
coalesced into the shape of a tall, 
beautiful young man with the face 
of an ingenuous demon. “Behold, 
is that superior?” 

“Oh, far superior!” Paul reached 
up to adjust a stray lock of hair, 
then realized he was not looking 
into a mirror. “Trouble is— well, 
I’d rather you chose someone else 
to model yourself on. You see, in 
my profession, it’s important to 



look as unique as possible; helps 
people remember you. I’m an ac- 
tor, you know. Currently I hap- 
pen to be at liberty, but the year 
before last—” 

“Well, whom should I appear 
like? Should I perhaps pick some 
fine upstanding figure from your 
public prints to emulate? Like 
your President, perhaply?” 

“I— hardly think so. It wouldn’t 
do to model yourself on someone 
well known— or even someone ob- 
scure whom you might just hap- 
pen to run into someday.” Being 
a kind-hearted young man, Paul 
added, “Come up to my room. I 
have some British film magazines 
and there are lots of relatively 
obscure English actors who are 
very decent-looking chaps.” 

CO they climbed up to Paul’s 
^ hot little room under the eaves 
and, after leafing through several 
magazines, Paul chose one Ivo 
Darcy as a likely candidate. 
Whereupon the stranger deli- 
quesced and reformed into the per- 
sonable simulacrum of young Mr. 
Darcy. 

“That’s quite a trick,” Paul ob- 
served as it finally got through to 
him what the other had done. “It 
would come in handy in the pro- 
fession— for character parts, you 
know.” 

“I fear you would never be able 
to acquisition it,” the stranger said, 
surveying his new self in the mir- 



MY FAIR PLANET 



59 




ror complacently. “It is not a trick 
but a racial ableness. You see, I 
feel I can trust you—” 

“—Of course I’m not really a 
character actor; I’m a leading man, 
but I believe one should be versa- 
tile, because there are times when 
a really good character part comes 
along—” 

“—I am not a human being. I 
am a native of the fifth planet 
circulating around the star you call 
Sirius, and we Sirians have the 
ableness to change ourselves into 
the apparition of any other livid 
form—” 

“I thought that might be a near- 
Eastern accent!” Paul exclaimed, 
diverted. “Is Lebanese anything 
like it? Because I understand 
there’s a really juicy part coming 
up in—” 

“I said Sirian, not Syrian; I do 
not come from Minor Asia but 
from outer space, from an other- 
where solar system. I am an out- 
worlder, an extraterrestrial.” 

“I hope you had a nice trip,” 
Paul said politely. “From Sirius, 
did you say? What’s the state of 
the theater there?” 

“In its infanticide,” the stranger 
told him, “but—” 

“Let’s face it,” Paul muttered 
bitterly, “it’s in its infancy here, 
too. No over-all planning. No ap- 
preciation of the fact that all the 
components that go to make up a 
production should be a continuing 
totality, instead of a tenuous coali- 



tion of separate forces which disin- 
tegrate—” 

“You, I comprehend, are disem- 
ployed at current. I should—” 

“You won’t find that situation in 
Russia!” Paul went on, pleased to 
discover a sympathetic audience in 
this intelligent foreigner. “Mind 
you,” he added quickly, “I dis- 
approve entirely of their politics. 
In fact, I disapprove of all poli- 
tics. But when it comes to the 
theater, in many respects the Rus- 
sians—” 

“—Like to make a proposal to 
our mutual advanceage— ” 

“—You wouldn’t find an actor 
there playing a lead role one season 
and then not be able to get any 
parts except summer stock and 
odd bits for the next two years. 
All right, so the show I had the 
lead in folded after two weeks, 
but the critics all raved about my 
performance. It was the play that 
stank!” 

“Will you terminate the mono- 
logue and hearken unto me!” the 
alien shouted. 

"D AUL stopped talking. His feel- 
ings were hurt. He had thought 
Ivo liked him; now he saw all the 
outworlder wanted to do was talk 
about his own problems. 

“I desire to extend to you a po- 
sition,” said Ivo. 

“I can’t take a regular job,” Paul 
said sulkily. “I have to be avail- 
able for interviews. Fellow I knew 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




took a job in a store and, when he 
was called to read for a part, he 
couldn’t get away. The fellow who 
did get that part became a big star, 
and maybe the other fellow could 
have been a star, too, but now 
all he is is a lousy chairman of the 
board of some department store 
chain—” 

“This work can be undergone 
at your convention between read- 
ings and interviews, whenever you 
have the timing. I shall pay you 
beautifully, being abundant with 
U.S.A. currency. I want you to teach 
me how to act.” 

“Teach you how to act,” Paul 
repeated, rather intrigued. “Well, 
I’m not a dramatic coach, you 
know; however, I do happen to 
have some ideas on the subject. I 
feel that most acting teachers now- 
adays fail to give their students a 
really thorough grounding in all 
aspects of the dramatic art All 
they talk about is method, method, 
method. But what about tech- 
nique?” 

“I have observed your species 
with great diligence and I thought 
I had acquisitioned your habits 
and speakings to perfectness. But 
I fear that, like my initial face, I 
have got them awry. I want you 
to teach me to act like a human 
being, to talk like a human being, 
to think like a human being.” 

Paul’s attention was really 
caught. “Well, that is a challenge! 
I don’t suppose Stanislavsky ever 



had to teach an extraterrestrial, or 
even Strasberg— ” 

“Then we are in accordance,” 
Ivo said. “You will instruction 
me?” He essayed a smile. 

Paul shuddered. “Very well,” 
he said. “We’ll start now. And I 
think the first thing we’d better 
start with is lessons in smiling.” 
Ivo proved to be a quick study. 
He not only learned to smile, but 
to frown and to express surprise, 
pleasure, horror— whatever the oc- 
casion demanded. He learned the 
knack of counterfeiting humanity 
with such skill that, Paul was 
moved to remark one afternoon 
when they were leaving Brooks 
Brothers after a fitting, “Some- 
times you seem even more human 
than I do, Ivo. I wish you’d watch 
out for that tendency to rant, 
though. You’re supposed to speak, 
not make speeches.” 

“I try not to,” Ivo said, “but I 
keep getting carried away by en- 
thusiasm.” 

“Apparently I have a real flair 
for teaching,” Paul went on as, 
expertly camouflaged by Brooks, 
the two young men melted into the 
dense charcoal-gray underbrush of 
Madison Avenue. “I seem to be 
even more versatile than I thought. 
Perhaps I have been— well, not 
wasting but limiting my talents.” 
“That may be because your 
talents have not been sufficiently 
appreciated,” his star pupil sug- 
gested, “or given enough scope.” 



MY FAIR PLANET 



61 




TVO was so perceptive! “As a 
matter of fact,” Paul agreed, 
“it has often seemed to me that if 
some really gifted individual, 
equally adept at acting, directing, 
producing, playwriting, teaching, 
et al., were to undertake a thor- 
ough synthesis of the theater— ah, 
but that would cost money,” he 
interrupted himself, “ana who 
would underwrite such a project? 
Certainly not the government of 
the United States.” He gave a bit- 
ter laugh. 

“Perhaps, under a new regime, 
conditions might be more favor- 
able for the artist—” 

“Shhh!” Paul looked nervously 
over his shoulder. “There are Sena- 
tors everywhere. Besides, I never 
said things were good in Russia, 
just better — for the actor, that is. 
Of course the plays are atrocious 
propaganda—” — 

“I was not referring to another 
human regime. The human being 
is, at best, save for certain choice 
spirits, unsympathetic to the arts. 
We outworlders have a far greater 
respect for things of the mind.” 
Paul opened his mouth; Ivo 
continued without giving him a 
chance to speak, “No doubt you 
have often wondered just what I 
am doing here on Earth?” 

The question had never crossed 
Paul’s mind. Feeling vaguely 
guilty, he murmured, “Some peo- 
ple have funny ideas of where to 
go for a vacation.” 



“I am here on business,” Ivo 
told him. “The situation on Sirius 
is serious.” 

“You know, that’s catchy! ‘The 
situation on Sirius is serious’,” Paul 
repeated, tapping his foot. “I’ve 
often thought of trying my hand 
at a musical com—” 

“I mean we have had a ser— 
grave population problem for the 
last couple of centuries, hence our 
government has sent out scouts 
to look for other planets with simi- 
lar atmosphere, climate, gravity 
and so on, where we can ship our 
excess population. So far, we have 
found very few.” 

When Paul’s attention was 
focused, he could be as quick as 
anybody to put two and two to- 
gether. “But Earth is already oc- 
cupied. In fact, when I was in 
school, I heard something about 
our having a population problem 
ourselves.” 

“The other planets we already 
—ah— took over were in a similar 
state,” Ivo explained. “We man- 
aged to surmount that difficulty.” 

“How?” Paul asked, though he 
already suspected the answer. 

“Oh, we didn’t dispose of all of 
the inhabitants. We merely weeded 
out the undesirables— who, by for- 
tunate chance, happened to be in 
the majority— and achieved a hap- 
py and peaceful coexistence with 
the rest.” 

“But, look,” Paul protested. “I 
mean to say ” 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“For instance,” Ivo said suave- 
ly, “take the vast body of people 
who watch television and who 
have never seen a legitimate play 
in their lives and, indeed, rarely 
go to the motion pictures. Surely 
they are expendable.” 

“Well, yes, of course. But even 
among them there might be— oh, 
say, a playwright’s mother—” 

“One of the first measures our 
regime would take would be to 
establish a vast network of com- 
munity theaters throughout the 
world. And you, Paul, would re- 
ceive first choice of starring roles.” 
“Now wait a minute!” Paul 
cried hotly. He seldom allowed 
himself to lose his temper, but 
when he did ... he got angry! “I 
pride myself that Fve gotten this 
far wholly on my own merits. I 
don’t believe in using influence 
to—” 

“But, my dear fellow, all I 
meant was that, with an intelli- 
gently coordinated theater and an 
intellectually adult audience, your 
abilities would be recognized au- 
tomatically.” 

“Oh,” said Paul. 

H E was not unaware that he 
was being flattered, but it 
was so seldom that anyone both- 
ered to pay him any attention 
when he was not playing a role 
that it was difficult not to suc- 
cumb. “Are— are you figuring on 
taking over the planet single- 



handed?” he asked curiously. 

“Heavens, no! Talented as I am, 
there are limits. I don’t do the— 
ah— dirty work myself. I just con- 
duct the preliminary investigation 
to determine how powerful the 
local defenses are.” 

“We have hydrogen bombs,” 
Paul said, trying to remember de- 
tails of a newspaper article he had 
once read in a producer’s ante- 
room, “and plutonium bombs 
and—” 

“Oh, I know about all those,” 
Ivo smiled expertly. “My job is 
checking to make sure you don’t 
have anything really dangerous.” 

All that night, Paul wrestled 
with his conscience. He knew he 
shouldn’t just let Ivo go on. Yet 
what else could he do? Go to the 
proper authorities? But which au- 
thorities were the proper ones? 
And even if he found them, who 
would believe an actor offstage, 
delivering such improbable lines? 
He would either be laughed at or 
accused of being part of a sub- 
versive plot. It might result in a 
lot of bad publicity which could 
ruin his career. 

So Paul did nothing about Ivo. 
He went back to the usual rounds 
of agents’ and producers’ offices, 
and the knowledge of why Ivo 
was on Earth got pushed farther 
into the back of his mind as he 
trudged from interview to reading 
to interview. 

It was an exceptionally hot Oc- 



MY FAIR PLANET 



63

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tober— the kind of weather when 
sometimes he almost lost his faith 
and began to wonder why he was 
batting his head against a stone 
wall, why he didn’t get a job in 
a department store somewhere or 
teaching school. And then he 
thought of the applause, the cur- 
tain calls, the dream of some day 
seeing his name in lights above the 
title of the play— and he knew he 
would never give up. Quitting the 
theater would be like committing 
suicide, for off the stage he was 
alive only technically. He was 
good; he knew he was good, so 
some day, he assured himself, he 
was bound to get his big break. 

Toward the end of that month, 
it came. After the maximum three 
readings, between which his hopes 
alternately waxed and waned, he 
was cast as the male lead in The 
Holiday Tree. The producers were 
more interested, they said, in get- 
ting someone who fitted the role 
of Eric Everard than in a big 
name — especially since the fe- 
male star preferred to have her 
luster undimmed by competition. 

Rehearsals took up so much of 
his time that he saw very little 
of Ivo for the next five weeks— 
but by then Ivo didn’t need him 
any more. Actually, they were no 
longer teacher and pupil now but 
companions, drawn together by the 
fact that they both belonged to dif- 
ferent worlds from the one in 
which they were living. Insofar as 



he could like anyone who existed 
outside of his imagination, Paul 
had grown rather fond of Ivo. 
And he rather thought Ivo liked 
him, too— but, because he couldn’t 
ever be quite sure of ordinary peo- 
ple’s reactions toward him, how 
could he be sure of an outworld- 
er’s? 

Ivo came around to rehearsals 
sometimes, but naturally it would 
be boring for him, since he wasn’t 
in the profession, and, after a while, 
he didn’t come around very often. 
At first, Paul felt a twinge of guilt; 
then he remembered that he need 
not worry. Ivo had his own work. 

HP HE whole Holiday T ree troupe 
went out of town for the try- 
outs, and Paul didn’t see Ivo at 
all for six weeks. Busy, happy 
weeks they were, for the play was 
a smash hit from the start. It 
played to packed houses in New 
Haven and Boston, and the box 
office in New York was sold out 
for months in advance before they 
even opened. 

“Must be kinda fun— acting,” 
Ivo told Paul the morning after 
the New York opening, as Paul 

weltered contentedly on his bed 

he had the best room in the house 
now— amid a pile of rave notices. 
At long last, he had arrived. 
Everybody loved him. He was a 
success. 

And now that he had read the 
reviews and they were all favor-

able, he could pay attention to the 
strange things that had happened 
to his friend. Raising himself up 
on an elbow, Paul cried, “Ivo, 
you’re mumbling! After all I taught 
you about articulation!” 

“I got t’hanging ’round with this 
here buncha actors while y’were 
gone,” Ivo said. “They say mumbl- 
ing’s the cornin’ thing. ’Sides, ykept 
yapping that I declaimed, so—” 
“But you don’t have to go to 
the opposite extreme and— Ivo/” 
Incredulously, Paul took in the 
full details of the other’s appear- 
ance. “What happened to your 
Brooks Brothers’ suits?” 

“Hung ’em inna closet,” Ivo 
replied, looking abashed. “I did 
wear one las’ night, though,” he 
went on defensively. “Wooden 
come dressed like this to y’open- 
ing. But all the other fellas wear 
blue jeans ’n leather jackets. I 
mean, hell, I gotta conform more’n 
anybody. Y’know that, Paul.” 
“And—” Paul sat bolt upright; 
this was the supreme outrage— 
“you’ve changed yourself! You’ve 
gotten younger!” 

“This is an age of yout’,” Ivo 
mumbled. “An’ I figured I was 
’bout ready for improvisation, like 
you said.” 

“Look, Ivo, if you really want 

to go on the stage ” 

“Hell, I don’ wanna be no ac- 
tor!” Ivo protested, far too vehe- 
mently. “Y’know damn’ well I’m 
a— a spy, scoutin’ ’round t’see if 



y’have any secret defenses before 
I make m’report.” 

“I don’t feel I’m giving away any 
government secrets,” Paul said, 
“when I tell you that the bastions 
of our defenses are not erected at 
the Actors’ Studio.” 

“Listen, pal, you lemme spy the 
way I wanna an’ I’ll letcha act the 
way you wanna.” 

Paul was disturbed by this 
change in Ivo because, although he 
had always tried to steer clear of 
social involvement, he could not 
help feeling that the young alien 
had become in a measure his 
responsibility — particularly now 
that he was a teen-ager. Paul 
would even have worried about 
Ivo, if there hadn’t been so many 
other things to occupy his mind. 
First of all, the producers of The 
Holiday Tree could not resist the 
pressure of an adoring public; al- 
though the original star sulked, 
three months after the play had 
opened in New York, Paul’s name 
went up in lights next to hers, over 
the title of the play. He was a 
star. 

That was good. But then there 
was Gregory. And that was bad. 
Gregory was Paul’s understudy— 
a handsome, sullen youth who had, 
on numerous occasions, been heard 
to utter words to the effect of : “It’s 
the part that’s so good, not him. 
If I had the chance to play Eric 
Everard just once, they’d give 
Lambrequin back to the Indians.”

Sometimes he had said the 
words in Paul’s hearing; some- 
times the remarks had been lov- 
ingly passed on by fellow members 
of the cast who felt that Paul 
ought to know. 

W¥ DON’T like that Gregory,” 
Paul told Ivo one Monday 
evening as they were enjoying a 
quiet smoke together, for there was 
no performance that night. “He 
used to be a juvenile delinquent, 
got sent to one of those reform 
schools where they use acting as 
therapy and it turned out to be 
his metier. But you never know 
when that kind’ll hear the call of 
the wild again.” 

“Aaaah, he’s a good kid,” Ivo 
said. “He just never had a chanct.” 
“Trouble is, I’m afraid he’s go- 
ing to make himself a chanct— 
chance, that is.” 

“Aaaah,” retorted Ivo, with pride- 
ful inarticulateness. 

However, when at six-thirty that 
Friday, Paul fell over a wire 
stretched between the jambs of the 
doorway leading to his private 
bathroom and broke a leg, even 
Ivo was forced to admit that this 
did not look like an accident. 

“Ivo,” Paul wailed when the 
doctor had left, “what am I going 
to do? I refuse to let Gregory go 
on in my place tonight!” 

“Y’gonna hafta,” Ivo said, shift- 
ing his gum to the other side of 
his mouth. “He’s y’unnastudy.” 



“But the doctor said it would 
be weeks before I can get around 
again. Either Gregory*!! take over 
the part completely with his in- 
terpretation and I’ll be left out in 
the cold, or more likely, he’ll louse 
up the play and it’ll fold before 
I’m on my feet.” 

“Y’gotta have more confidence 
in y’self, kid. The public ain’t gon- 
na forgetcha in a few weeks.” 

But Paul knew far better than 
the idealistic Ivo how fickle the 
public can be. However, he chose 
an argument that would appeal to 
the boy. “Don’t forget, he booby- 
trapped me!” 

“Cerfny looks like it,” Ivo was 
forced to concede. “But watcha 
gonna do? Y’can’t prove it. ’Sides, 
the curtain’s gonna gwup in a li’l 
over a nour— ” 

Paul gripped Ivo’s sinewy wrist 
“Ivo, you’ve got to go on for me!” 
“Y’got rocks in yhead or some- 
pin?” Ivo demanded, trying not to 
look pleased. “I ain’t gotta Nequi- 
ty card, and even if I did, he’s 
y’unnastudy.” 

“No, you don’t understand. I 
don’t want you to go on as Ivo 
Darcy playing Eric Everard. I 
want you to go on as Paul Lam- 
brequin playing Eric Everard. You 
can do it, Ivo!” 

“Good Lord, so I can!” Ivo 
whispered, temporarily neglecting 
to mumble. “I’d almost forgotten.” 
“You know my lines, too. You’ve 
cued me in my part often enough.” 



MY FAIR PLANET

Ivo rubbed his hand over his 
forehead. “Yeah, I guess I do.” 
“Ivo,” Paul beseeched him, “I 
thought we were — pals. I don’t 
want to ask any favors, but I 
helped you out when you were 
in trouble. I always figured I could 
rely on you. I never thought you’d 
let me down.” 

“An’ I won’t.” Ivo gripped Paul’s 
hand. “I’ll go on t’night ’n play 
’at part like it ain’t never been 
played before! I’ll—” 

“No! No! Play it the way I 
played it. You’re supposed to be 
me, Ivo! Forget Strasberg; go back 
to Stanislavsky.” 

“Okay, pal,” Ivo said. “Will do.” 
“And promise me one thing, Ivo. 
Promise me you won’t mumble." 

Ivo winced. “Okay, but you’re 
the on’y one I’d do ’at for.” 

Slowly, he began to shimmer. 
Paul held his breath. Maybe Ivo 
had forgotten how to transmute 
himself. But technique triumphed 
over method. Ivo Darcy gradual- 
ly coalesced into the semblance of 
Paul Lambrequin. The show would 
go on! 

frWTELL, how was every- 
thing?” Paul asked anxious- 
ly when Ivo came into his room 
shortly after midnight. 

“Pretty good,” Ivo said, sitting 
down on the edge of the bed. 
“Gregory was extremely surprised 
to see me— asked me half a dozen 
times how I was feeling.” Ivo was 



not only articulating, Paul was 
gratified to notice; he was enun- 
ciating. 

“But the show— how did that 
go? Did anyone suspect you were 
a ringer?” 

“No,” Ivo said slowly. “No, I 
don’t think so. I got twelve cur- 
tain calls,” he added, staring 
straight ahead of him with a 
dreamy smile. “Twelve.” 

“Friday nights, the audience is 
always enthusiastic.” Then Paul 
swallowed hard and said, “Besides, 
I’m sure you were great in the 
role.” 

But Ivo didn’t seem to hear 
him. Ivo was still wrapped in his 
golden daze. “Just before the cur- 
tain went up, I didn’t think I was 
going to be able to do it. I be- 
gan to feel all quivery inside, the 
way I do before I— I change.” 

“Butterflies in the stomach is 
the professional term.” Paul 
nodded wisely. “A really good 
actor gets them before every per- 
formance. No matter how many 
times I play a role, there’s that 
minute when the house lights start 
to dim when I’m in an absolute 
panic—” 

“—And then the curtain went 
up and I was all right. I was fine. 
I was Paul Lambrequin. I was 
Eric Everard. I was— everything.” 

“Ivo,” Paul said, clapping him 
on the shoulder, “you’re a born 
trouper.” 

“Yes,” Ivo murmured, “I’m be- 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ginning to think so myself.” 

For the next four weeks, Paul 
Lambrequin lurked in his room 
while Ivo Darcy played Paul Lam- 
brequin playing Eric Everard. 

“It’s terrific of you to take all 
this time away from your duties, 
old chap,” Paul said to Ivo one 
day between the matinee and the 
evening performances. “I really do 
appreciate it. Although I suppose 
you’ve managed to squeeze some 
of them in. I never see you on 
non-matinee afternoons.” 

“Duties?” Ivo repeated vacant- 
ly. “Yes, of course— my duties.” 
“Let me give you some profes- 
sional advice, though. Be more 
careful when you take off your 
makeup. There’s still some grease 
paint in the roots of your hair.” 
“Sloppy of me,” Ivo agreed, get- 
ting to work with a towel. 

“I can’t understand why you 
bother to put on the stuff at all,” 
Paul grinned, “when all you need 
to do is just change a little more.” 
“I know.” Ivo rubbed his 
temples vigorously. “I suppose I 
just like the— smell of the stuff.” 
“Ivo,” Paul laughed, “there’s no 
use trying to kid me; you are 
stagestruck. I’m sure I have enough 
pull now to get you a bit part 
somewhere, when I’m up and 
around again, and then you can 
get yourself an Equity card. May- 
be,” he added amusedly, “I can 
even have you replace Gregory as 
my understudy.” 



T ATER, in retrospect, Paul 
" thought perhaps there had 
been a curious expression in Ivo’s 
eyes, but right then he’d had no 
inkling that anything untoward was 
up. He did not find out what had 
been at the back of Ivo’s mind 
until the Sunday before the Tues- 
day on which he was planning to 
resume his role. 

“Lord, it’s going to be good to 
feel that stage under my feet 
again,” he said as he went through 
a series of complicated limbering- 
up exercises of his own devise- 
ment, which he had sometimes 
thought of publishing as The 
Lambrequin Time and Motion 
Studies. It seemed unfair to keep 
them from other actors. 

Ivo turned around from the 
mirror in which he had been con- 
templating their mutual beauty, 
“Paul,” he said quietly, “you’re 
never going to feel that stage un- 
der your feet again.” 

Paul sat on the floor and stared 
at him. 

“You see, Paul,” Ivo said, “I am 
Paul Lambrequin now. I am more 
Paul Lambrequin than I was — 
whoever I was on my native 
planet. I am more Paul Lambre- 
quin than you ever were. You 
learned the part superficially, Paul, 
but I really feel it.” 

“It’s not a part,” Paul said 
querulously. “It’s me. I’ve always 
been Paul Lambrequin.” 

“How can you be sure of that? 



MY FAIR PLANET 



69 




You’ve had so many identities, 
why should this be the true one? 
No, you only think you’re Paul 
Lambrequin. I know I am.” 

“Dammit,” Paul said, “that’s the 
identity in which I’ve taken out 
Equity membership. And be 
reasonable, Ivo — there can’t be 
two Paul Lambrequins.” 

Ivo smiled sadly. “No, Paul, 
you’re right. There can’t.” 

Of course Paul had known all 
along that Ivo was not a human 
being. It was only now, however, 
that full realization came to him 
of what a ruthless alien monster 
the other was, existing only to 
gratify his own purposes, unaware 
that others had a right to exist. 

“Are— are you going to— dispose 
of me, then?” Paul asked faintly. 

“To dispose of you, yes, Paul. 
But not to kill you. My kind has 
killed enough, conquered enough. 
We have no real population prob- 
lem; that was just an excuse we 
made to salve our own con- 
sciences.” 

“You have consciences, do 
you?” Paul’s face twisted in a 
sneer that he himself sensed right 
away was overly melodramatic and 
utterly unconvincing. Somehow, 
he could never be really genuine 
offstage. 

Ivo made a sweeping gesture. 
“Don’t be bitter, Paul. Of course 
we do. All intelligent life-forms 
do. It’s one of the penalties of 
sentience!” 



For a moment, Paul forgot him- 
self. “Watch it, Ivo. You’re begin- 
ning to ham up your lines.” 

“We can institute birth control,” 
Ivo went on, his manner subdued. 
“We can build taller buildings. Oh, 
there are many ways we can cope 
with the population increase. 
That’s not the problem. The prob- 
lem is how to divert our creative 
energies from destruction to con- 
struction. And I think I have 
solved it.” 

“How will your people know 
you have,” Paul asked cunning- 
ly, “since you say you’re not go- 
ing back?” 

“I am not going back to Sirius, 
Paul— you are. It is you who are 
going to teach my people the art 
of peace to replace the art of 
war.” 

OAUL felt himself turn what 
was probably a very effective 
white. “But— but I can’t even speak 
the language! I—” 

“You will learn the language 
during the journey. I spent those 
afternoons I was away making a 
set of Sirian-in-a- Jiffy records for 
you. Sirian’s a beautiful language, 
Paul, much more expressive than 
any of your Earth languages. 
You’ll like it.” 

“I’m sure I shall, but—” 

“Paul, you are going to bring 
my people the outlet for self-ex- 
pression they have always needed. 
You see, I lied to you. The theater 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




on Sirius is not in its infancy; it 
has never been conceived. If it 
had been, we would never have 
become what we are today. Can 

you imagine a race like mine, 

so superbly fitted to practice the 
dramatic art, remaining in blind 
ignorance that such an art exists!” 

“It does seem a terrible waste,” 
Paul had to agree, although he 
could not be truly sympathetic 
just then. “But I am hardly 
equipped—” 

“Who is better equipped than 
you to meet this mighty challenge? 
Can’t you see that at long last yoq 
will be able to achieve your great 
synthesis of the theatrical arts— 
as producer, teacher, director, ac- 
tor, playwright, whatever you will, 
working with a cast of individuals 
who can assume any shape or 
form, who have no preconceived 
notions of what can be done and 
what cannot. Oh, Paul, what a 
glorious opportunity awaits you 
on Sirius V. How I envy you!” 

“Then why don’t you do it your- 
self?” Paul asked. 

Ivo smiled sadly again. “Un- 
fortunately, I do not have your 
manifold abilities. All I can do 
is act. Superbly, of course, but 
that’s all. I don’t have the capaci- 
ty to build a living theater from 
scratch. You do. I have talent, Paul, 
but you have genius.” 

“It is a temptation,” Paul admit- 
ted. “But to leave my own 
world . .” 



“Paul, Earth isn’t your world. 
You carry yours along with you 
wherever you go. Your world 
exists in the mind and heart, not 
in reality. In any real situation, 
you’re just as uncomfortable on 
Earth as you would be on Sirius.” 
“Yes, but—” 

“Think of it this way, Paul. 
You’re not leaving your world. 
You’re just leaving Earth to go on 
the road. It’s a longer road, but 
look at what’s waiting for you at 
the end of it” 

“Yes, look,” Paul said, reality 
very much to the fore in his mind 
and heart at that moment “death 
or vivisection.” 

“Paul, do you believe I’d do 
that to you?” There were tears 
in Ivo’s eyes. If he was acting, he 
was a great performer. I really am 
one hell of a good teacher, Paul 
thought, and with lots of raw ma- 
terial like Ivo to work with, I 
could . Could he really mean 
what he’s saying? 

“They won’t harm you, Paul, 
because you will come to Sirius 
bearing a message from me. You 
will tell my people that Earth 
has a powerful defensive weapon 
and you have come to teach them 
its secret. And it’s true, Paul. The 
theater is your world’s most pow- 
erful weapon, its best defense 
against the universal enemy — 
reality.” 

“Ivo,” Paul said, “you really 
must check that tendency toward 



MY FAIR PLANET 



71 




bombast. Especially with a purple 
speech like that; you’ve simply 
got to learn to underplay. You’ll 
watch out for that when I’m gone, 
won’t you?” 

“I will!” Ivo’s face lighted up. 
“Oh, I will, Paul. I promise never 
to chew the scenery again. I won’t 
so much as nibble on a prop!” 

r |^HE next day, the two of them 
went up to Bear Mountain 
where Ivo’s ship had been cached 
all those months. Ivo explained to 
Paul how the controls worked and 
showed him where the clean 
towels were. 

Pausing in the airlock, Paul 
looked back toward Manhattan. 
“I’d dreamed so many years of see- 
ing my name up in lights on 
Broadway,” he murmured, “and 
now, just when I made it—” 

“I’ll keep it up there,” Ivo 
vowed. “I promise. And, mean- 
while, you’ll be building a new 
Broadway up there in the stars!” 

“Yes,” Paul said dreamily, “that 
is something to look forward to, 
isn’t it?” Fresh, enthusiastic au- 
diences, performers untrammeled 
by tradition, a cooperative govern- 
ment, unlimited funds— why, there 
was a whole wonderful new world 
opening up before him. 

“—In another ten years or so,” 
Ivo was saying, “Sirian actors will 
be coming to Earth in droves, mak- 
ing the native performers look 
sick—” 



Paul smiled wisely. “Now, Ivo, 
you know Equity would never 
stand for that .” 

“Equity won’t be able to help 
itself. Public pressure will surge 
upward in a mounting wave and—” 
Ivo stopped. “Sorry. I was rant- 
ing again, wasn’t I? It’s being out 
in the open air that does it. I need 
to be bounded by the four walls of 
a theater.” 

“That’s a fallacy,” Paul began. 
“On the Greek stage—” 

“Save that for the stars, fella,” 
Ivo smiled. “You’ve got to leave 
before it gets light.” Then he wrung 
Paul’s hand. “Good-by, kid,” he 
said. “You’ll knock ’em dead on 
Sirius.” 

“Good-by, Ivo.” Paul returned 
the grip. Then he got inside and 
closed the airlock door behind him. 
He did hope Ivo would correct 
that tendency toward declamation; 
on the other hand, it was certainly 
better than mumbling. 

Paul put a Sirian-in-a-jiffy rec- 
ord on the turntable, because he 
might as well start learning the 
language right away. Of course 
he’d have no one to talk to but 
himself for many months, but then, 
when all was said and done, he 
was his own favorite audience. He 
strapped himself into the accelera- 
tion couch and prepared for take- 
off. 

“Next week, East Lynne,” he 
said to himself.

whether there is no special sched- 
ule to it. There is none; it solely 
depends on the type of questions 
I get. 

Having cleared up what may 
be termed a policy matter, I can 
proceed to the first factual ques- 
tion. 

TTERE is a question that came 
from as far away as one 
can go from New York and still 
be in the continental United States, 
meaning southern California. I 
might say that the question came 
in triplicate — that is, three dif- 
ferent readers wrote about it, all 
of them quoting a newspaper 
column. 

By now, most people, certainly 
all science fiction readers, know the 
principal considerations which went 
into the planning of the orbit for 
the Vanguard satellite. 

The orbit is to be elliptical, with 
its nearest point (perigee) about 
200 miles above mean sea level 
and its farthest point (apogee) 
about 1600 miles from the sur- 
face of the Earth. It is expected 
that the satellite, every time it 
passes its perigee, encounters a 
small amount of resistance because 
there are still some oxygen and 
nitrogen molecules (or atoms) left 
at that altitude. The result of this 
“residual air resistance” is tech- 
nically known as “orbital decay” 
(Fig. 1). 

The satellite, coming from 



apogee, will enter the upper atmos- 
phere to pass through its perigee. 
Residual air resistance causes a 
small loss of momentum of the 
satellite and the next apogee, 
reached 45 minutes later, will 
therefore be a little bit closer to 
the Earth’s surface. This, in effect, 
causes a shrinking of the orbit 
The focal point of the ellipses will 
remain the same all the way 
through, namely the center of the 
Earth. 

The perigee point may come a 
little closer to the surface of the 
Earth, but not much. The apogee 
point will come steadily closer, so 
that the orbit will assume a more 
circular shape as time goes on. 
In the end, it will be a circle, if 
only momentarily, at the altitude 
the perigee point then has. The in- 
terval from the first apogee to 
circular orbit is the period of the 
orbital decay. It is now thought 
that this may take as long as nine 
years. 

Just to leave no loose ends 
hanging, I have to add that the 
circular orbit will then change into 
a tight spiral along which the satel- 
lite will approach the ground, but 
will not reach it, for aerodynamic 
heating will vaporize the satellite 
as soon as it encounters denser 
layers of the atmosphere. 

Now the discussion in California 
and the letters which I received as 
a result of it concerned terminolo- 
gy, when you come right down to 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

(Viking Press, Inc.) 



it. Seems that somebody, in ex- 
plaining this expected performance, 
had said that the satellite is 
“slowed down” at perigee by the 
residual air resistance. Somebody 
else then complained in injured 
tones that this was “public misin- 
formation” because the satellite 
will be speeded up. My readers 
wanted to know which one of the 
two was right. 

The answer could be “both” or 
“neither” depending on (A) what 
you have in mind and (B) how 
you use the Queen’s English. But 
let us not waste time in trying to 
decide who meant what and was 



therefore right or wrong. Let us 
instead try to understand what 
really goes on. 

The heavy circle in the diagram 
represents the surface of the Earth; 
the large, lighter concentric circle 
represents an altitude of 250 miles. 
Now let us first imagine that there 
is such a satellite in space in such 
an orbit, but that the Earth has 
no atmosphere. Then the elliptical 
orbit would be permanent and 
there would be no orbital decay. 
But the orbital velocity of a satel- 
lite depends on its distance from 
the Earth’s center. If you had one 
satellite 1600 miles from the sur-

face in a circular orbit and another 
satellite 200 miles from the sur- 
face in a circular orbit, the “200- 
mile satellite” would have to move 
faster to stay in its orbit than the 
“1600-mile satellite.” Logically, 
then, a satellite in an elliptical or- 
bit also has to move faster when it 
is closer to the surface than it does 
when farther from the surface. 

IT must be pointed out that the 
-*■ satellite which is in such an 
elliptical orbit will move somewhat 
faster when going through its 200- 
mile perigee than would a satellite

in a 200-mile circular orbit. This, 
again, is only logical, for the satel- 
lite in the elliptical orbit needs 
some extra energy to climb out 
against Earth’s gravity to its 
apogee. Also, when at apogee, it 
will move somewhat more slowly 
than a satellite in a 1600-mile cir- 
cular orbit. If it were fast enough 
for such an orbit, it would just stay 
at 1600 miles. 

The important thing to remem- 
ber of all this is that the satellite 
is faster at perigee. Therefore, in 
coming in from apogee, the satel- 
lite does speed up. At this moment, 
we restore the atmosphere which 
we had to leave out for the fun- 
damental explanation. Encounter- 
ing what air resistance there is 
200 miles up, the satellite does 
lose some of its speed. 

It does not pass through its 
perigee point with the same veloci- 
ty it would have if there were no 
resistance. So it emerges from the 
atmosphere somewhat slower than 
it would if the atmosphere were 
not there. Going out to apogee 
again, it slows up more and more 
because it now climbs against the 
Earth’s gravity. As soon as it has 
passed apogee, it speeds up again, 
for it now moves deeper into the 
Earth’s gravitational field. 

The main velocity changes, 
therefore, are not brought about 
by the residual air resistance at 
perigee, but are simply inherent in 
an elliptical orbit.

In discussing this, there had 
been the assumption that we were 
dealing with the first dozen or so 
perigee passages. Now we can go 
on to the time when the orbital 
decay has progressed to a notice- 
able extent. 

Let’s say that the apogee is now 
only 800 miles from the surface, 
while the perigee has slipped from 
200 miles to 190 miles altitude. 
This is an orbit which is generally 
nearer the Earth, in all its parts; 
hence the satellite has to have a 
higher orbital velocity in every 

FOR YOUR I NFORMATION 



point of its orbit. You can thus 
insist on saying that the perigee 
passages through a tenuous layer 
of the upper atmosphere .have 
speeded up the satellite. They 
have, by way of forcing the satel- 
lite into a smaller and nearer 
orbit. 

But although the satellite now 
moves generally faster than at the 
outset, each perigee passage still 
causes a small velocity loss. How- 
ever, this loss is substracted from 
a larger total. A reasonably cor- 
rect comparison might be to say 

77 




that the “withdrawal” due to the 
perigee passage is smaller than the 
“accumulated interest” Though 
there is a small loss during every 
perigee passage, the orbital velocity 
is higher. This goes on through the 
whole orbital decay and even 
through most of the spiral path. 

The real slowdown does not 
take place until denser layers of 
the atmosphere are reached. But 
this slowdown, with its conver- 
sion of momentum into heat, also 
means the end of the satellite.

O NE of the letters received 
read, severely condensed, as 
follows: “Reading the newspapers, 
one gets the impression as if there 
will be no other rocket experi- 
ments in the International Geo- 
physical Year than U. S. and 
U.S.S.R. rockets. Only occasional- 
ly does one read about other 
rockets. Could you tell what other 
rockets are going to be used?” 
Sure. Just keep on reading. 
When it comes to upper-atmos- 
phere research rockets, there are 
a few which can be dubbed the 
work horses. The largest of these 
work horses is Aerojet’s Aerobee- 
Hi rocket, which also holds the 
high-altitude record for single-stage 
rockets with booster. One Aerobee- 
Hi, fired from the White Sands 
Proving Grounds, reached an alti- 
tude of 193 miles.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The United States opened its 
participation in the IGY on July 4, 
1957, with the firing of an Aero- 
bee-Hi from an “igloo” near Fort 
Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. The 
“igloo,” of course, was a modern 
version involving concrete and 
stainless steel; its more solemn of- 
ficial name is that of an “all- 
weather rocket launching facility” 
(Fig. 2). With its doors closed, it 
is a shelter for fueling and check- 
ing rockets in reasonable comfort. 
For a firing, the doors are opened 
so that the exhaust blast of the 
booster can escape into the open. 

The Aerobee-Hi rocket (Fig. 3) 
is about 21 feet in length with a 
diameter of 15 inches. The volume 
reserved for scientific instruments 
is 6 cubic feet; the payload can 
weigh from 120 to 200 lbs. The 
fuels are aniline and red fuming 
nitric acid. For the takeoff, there 
is a solid-fuel booster 6 V 2 feet in 
length with a burning time of 2.5 
seconds. (The burning time of the 
rocket is 42 seconds.) At least 
40 Aerobee-Hi rockets will be fired 
during the IGY from various 
places where there are launching 
towers available. The northern- 
most launching tower is the one 
mentioned near Fort Churchill, 
which is the northernmost point 
in continental North America that 
can be reached by rail. 

Another such work horse is the 
two-stage solid-fuel rocket Nike- 
Cajun. Its first stage is the booster 



of the anti-aircraft rocket Nike 
Ajax, its second stage the 13-foot 
solid-fuel Cajun rocket. Since the 
Nike booster has a length of 11 
feet, the total length of the Nike- 
Cajun is 24 feet. The takeoff weight 
is about 1600 lbs., or about 70 lbs. 
more than the weight of a fueled 
Aerobee-Hi without booster. 

N IKE-CAJUN, because of its 
smaller size, is somewhat 
more flexible in use than the Aero- 
bee-Hi. But the maximum pay- 
load weight it can carry is 60 lbs. 
and with that payload the peak al- 
titude is around 90 miles. At least 
65 Nike-Cajun rockets will be fired 
during the IGY, some from estab- 
lished firing sites like White Sands 
and Fort Churchill, others from 
shipboard. 

Third of the work horses is the 
“rockoon,” which is the 12-foot 
solid-fuel Deacon rocket carried to 
an altitude of 80,000 feet or there- 
abouts by a plastic “Skyhook” bal- 
loon. The reason for this arrange- 
ment is that the rocket is launched 
at a height where more than 80 
per cent of the atmosphere is be- 
low. 

The increase in altitude obtained 
by this method is nearly incred- 
ible. A Deacon rocket fired from 
the ground on a near-vertical tra- 
jectory will attain a peak altitude 
of about 60,000 feet. If carried to 
that peak altitude and fired from 
there, it will rise to 60 miles. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



79 




Unfortunately, the balloon needs 
several hours to rise to 60,000 feet 
or higher. For this reason, wherever 
feasible, the balloon is released six 
or eight hours ahead of the time 
set for the firing of the rocket. It 
will climb to its peak altitude and 
just float there. The rocket is then 
fired by remote control from the 
ground or from shipboard. 

At least two dozen American 
rockoons will be used during the 
IGY, mostly for studies of the so- 
called solar flares, which are in- 
tensely bright spots on the Sun 
that interfere with radio commu- 
nication and also release showers 
of cosmic rays. 

The American rockoons (Fig. 
4) will be joined by a few dozen 
British rockoons, which are 18- 
foot Bristol-University-Fairy rock- 
ets, also released from plastic bal- 
loons at 60,000 feet or higher and 
expected to reach 60 miles, like 
their American counterparts. 

If a solar flare puts in an ap- 
pearance— the Sun was kind enough 
to supply one for the .very open- 
ing of the International Geophysi- 
cal Year— and the scientists feel 
that a rockoon cannot climb up 
fast enough to do any good, they 
may call on the Air Force or on 
the Navy for a Rockaire. 

These Rockaires are smaller 
solid-fuel rockets, about 12 feet in 
length, which are carried by fast 
aircraft. The procedure of firing is 
for the plane to climb to the maxi- 



mum altitude at which it still 
handles safely, then loop over, fir- 
ing the rocket at the instant the 
plane’s fuselage is in a vertical 
position. The Air Force and Navy 
Rockaires differ chiefly in the use 
of different airplanes. The ex- 
pected maximum height reached 
by these rockets is around 35 
miles. 

These are the American IGY 
rockets. 

r T 1 HE British high-altitude rocket 
to be used is called the Sky- 
lark. It was designed by the Royal 
Aircraft Establishment, stands 
about 25 feet tall, has a diameter 
of 17.4 inches and three fixed tail 
fins. It is a solid-fuel rocket with 
a slow-burning charge that will 
need about 30 seconds to be com- 
pletely consumed. The takeoff 
weight of the Skylark is 2560 lbs. 
Test firings carried out in Aus- 
tralia reached peak altitudes of 
around 93 miles, carrying 65 lbs. 
of payload. The versatility of the 
Skylark is unfortunately reduced 
by the fact that it needs a 180-ft. 
launching tower. 

A Japanese research rocket is 
also in the running. Its name is 
Kappa and it is a two-stage solid- 
fuel rocket. The peak altitude ex- 
pected for the Kappa rocket is 
around 80 miles. The number to 
be fired is not established. A Japa- 
nese rocket expert I asked told 
me that the number would depend 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




on two factors: “availability in the 
right place at the right time, and 
opportunity.” These are about the 
same factors which apply to our 
Rockaires, so that a good tabula- 
tion will be possible only after the 
event. 

The Russians, in addition to 
their own satellite program, 
are going to fire a large number 
of high-altitude research rockets 
from European Russia, from Franz 
Joseph’s Land and from Antarc- 
tica. 

The rocket to be used is called 
the Mateo, which is simply an ab- 
breviation of Meteorological Rock- 
et. It is a liquid-fuel rocket with 
solid-fuel booster; its overall 
length is just about 30 feet and 
the takeoff weight one metric ton. 
It needs a launching tower which 
the Russians have built in the 
shape of a girder mast surrounded 
by a spiral staircase. 

The fuels for the main rocket 
are purified kerosene — probably 
about the same as some of our 
jet fuels — and nitric acid. The 
booster is a ring-shaped cluster of 
six solid-fuel rockets; the open 
space in the center permits the 
blast from the liquid-fuel rocket 
motor to escape. At takeoff, main 
rocket and the booster cluster are 
ignited simultaneously. 

The solid-fuel booster burns for 
two seconds and then drops off. 
The main rocket motor burns for 
one minute. At an altitude of about 



40 miles, the nose cone with the 
payload is separated from the main 
body by one or several small solid- 
fuel rockets which provide a small 
additional boost for the nose cone. 
This separation also frees two 
parachutes, one for the main body 
of the rocket, the other for the 
nose cone. The nose cone’s para- 
chute just trails behind while the 
nose cone climbs to 65 miles. 
Above 40 miles, the air is far too 
thin to make the parachute effec- 
tive. 

A larger research rocket, with 
125 miles peak altitude, has also 
been announced, but has not been 
described even in outline. Nor has 
it been stated how many of the 
one hundred rocket shots planned 
by the Russians are to be made 
with the Meteo and how many 
with the larger rocket. 

The Selective 
Epidemic 

'T’HIS letter’s from as far away 
as is possible— barring space 
travel— namely from a lady in New 
South Wales, Australia. She wrote: 

“I have read two stories lately 
in which epidemics were the main 
plot ingredient. In one a disease 
wipes out all white men and in 
the other a disease is mentioned 
to which only white men are im- 
mune. Is this possible? It seems 
to me that species which can in- 
terbreed would not be immune to

each other’s diseases.” 

Well, the strange fact is that 
sometime during the seventeenth 
century there was a disease which 
attacked one nationality only. It 
is known in medical history as the 
Sudor anglicus (English sweat) 
because its latter stages were 
characterized by excessive per- 
spiration of a typical and very 
penetrating odor. It seems to have 
been inevitably fatal, but it at- 
tacked Englishmen only! Though 
it was indubitably an infection, 
Danes, Dutchmen, Frenchmen and 
Germans living among the English 
escaped unscathed. The disease 
ran a short and violent course, had, 
if I remember correctly, one more 
short flare-up after the main epi- 
demic and has not been heard of 
since. 

Naturally, it is almost impos- 
sible to offer an explanation almost 
three centuries later, but one might 
suspect that it had something to 
do with a vitamin deficiency. This 
deficiency may not have been bad 
enough by itself to cause notice- 
able symptoms — moreover, the 
doctors of that time did not know 
of deficiency diseases and there- 
fore did not know what to look 
for — but might have rendered its 
bearer helpless to some infection. 

If this guess is correct, the other 
nationalities escaped because their 
dietary habits were different and 
made them resistant to the infec- 
tion. Also, provided the guess is 



correct, it could not repeat, for 
the first thing any doctor would do 
nowadays would be to stuff the 
patient with vitamins. But what- 
ever the explanation, there was a 
disease attacking one nationality 
only, in spite of the fact that this 
nationality is perfectly capable of 
interbreeding with its neighbors. 

A few similar examples from 
the past are explained: they al- 
ways involved a contact between 
populations which had been iso- 
lated before. There the case al- 
ways was that one group had ac- 
quired a reasonable degree of 
other group had not. As a result, 
immunity to a disease while the 
the group to which this disease was 
a novelty was decimated by it. 

Again, such cases cannot re- 
peat any more, partly because 
there are hardly any isolated popu- 
lations left, partly because modem 
medicine could do something 
about it. 

Back to Dinosaurs 

nr HE last query I can take care 
of in this column is a letter 
which was written in direct refer- 
ence to my column in the June 
1957 issue, entitled “Tribes of the 
Dinosaurs.” You may remember 
that one of the illustrations (on 
page 66 of that issue) showed a 
brontosauruslike dinosaur which 
has been found in China. 

The correspondent admitted 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




that this picture looked like all 
the other pictures of such dino- 
saurs. But, he wanted to know, 
weren’t they all wrong? They are 
always drawn with legs like those 
of elephants. Yet the dinosaurs 
were reptiles. Wasn’t it more rea- 
sonable to suppose that their legs 
had been like those of lizards or 
of crocodiles, bent instead of 
straight? And this, the correspond- 
ent continued, was not just his 
own idea; he had read somewhere 
that a scientist had said the same. 
Why didn’t I have this more rea- 
sonable concept drawn up? Didn’t 
I know any better, or did my wife 
refuse to draw it? 

As for the last remark, here is 
proof that she did not refuse (Fig. 
5). This is the concept my critic 
had in mind, with the more usual 
type of representation for com- 
parison (Fig. 6). Now for the his- 
tory of this idea. 

The first of these dinosaurs 
(called Jhe sauropods) to be dis- 
covered and to be reconstructed 
was Brontosaurus excelsus, found 
in Wyoming by Prof. Othniel C. 
Marsh and first described by him 
in 1879. In 1883, Marsh drew up 
a preliminary reconstruction which 
was followed in 1891 by a defini- 
tive reconstruction. It showed bron- 
tosaurus just as it is still pictured. 

Soon after the nearly complete 
brontosaurus skeleton was found, 
Prof. Marsh came across remains 
of another dinosaur of the same 



general type, but no doubt a dif- 
ferent species, more likely a dif- 
ferent genus. There was enough to 
establish detail and the name be- 
came Diplodocus longus. More re- 
mains of diplodocus were found in 
Wyoming in 1899 and 1900. 

It was diplodocus, not bronto- 
saurus, which caused the fight 
about the position of its legs. It 
was a discussion teeming with ana- 
tomical detail and complicated by 
the fact that this set of tail ver- 
tebrae first ascribed to diplodocus 
turned out to belong to bronto- 
saurus and that bone of the pelvic 
region was not diplodocus, either, 
but belonged to morosaurus. 

Nature had mixed up some of 
the skeletons rather thoroughly 
and it took time to disentangle 
the fossilized mess. 

H owever, in 1901 it looked 

as if there had been two spe- 
cies of diplodocus, namely Diplo- 
docus longus, described by Marsh, 
and Diplodocus Carnegiei, de- 
scribed by J. B. Hatcher. (Now 
everybody is convinced that the 
two were one and the same, the 
minor differences being attribut- 
able to age or sex differences.) 

Andrew Carnegie, after whom 
the second diplodocus was named, 
decided to do something. By about 
1906, a nearly complete skeleton 
of Diplodocus Carnegiei existed, 
put together from the remains of 
several individuals. The few bones

that had not been actually found, 
like a few vertebrae and broken- 
off ends of ribs, could be confi- 
dently reconstructed. When the 
reconstruction was finished, Car- 
negie had several Plaster of Paris 
casts of every bone made and pre- 
sented them to various museums 
in Europe. One went to the Brit- 
ish Museum of Natural History 
in London, one, I believe, to Brus- 
sels, and another one to the Mu- 
seum of Natural History in Berlin. 

The curators and directors 
wrote grateful letters to Mr. Car- 
negie and mounted their reproduc- 
tions just as fast as feasible, fol- 
lowing the scheme established by 
Marsh for brontosaurus. They had 
just unveiled them when potential 
disaster appeared in print In 1908, 
Oliver Perry Hay published a 
paper in which an alligatorlike leg 

84 



position was defended. And one 
year later, Prof. G. Tornier in Ber- 
lin published another paper which 
said the same. 

There were a number of minor 
disagreements between Hay and 
Tornier, especially as regards the 
position of the forefeet, but both 
said that the legs must have been 
bent and that the belly must have 
been dragging on the ground. 

The director of the Berlin Mu- 
seum even placed a large drawing 
of Tomier’s reconstruction in front 
of the mounted skeleton with the 
legend: “Mounting of the Diplo- 
docus Skeleton as corrected by G. 
Tornier” — in the original: Berich- 
tigte Aufstellung des Diplodocus 
nach G. Tornier. 

That sign was still there in 1928 
even though, in the meantime, sev- 
eral paleontologists had jumped

Drawing by Olga Ley 



into the breach and proved that 
Marsh had been perfectly correct 
Especially Prof. Othenio Abel of 
Vienna wrote a rather amusing 
(though perfectly serious) paper 
in which he proved that diplo- 
docus, according to the actual 
measurements of the skeleton, 
could have moved in that position 
only if he found a five-foot-deep 
ditch going in the right direction. 
Others, like Abel, showed that the 



joints simply did not permit such 
a position; they were built for the 
pillarlike upright leg that had been 
assumed by most experts all along. 

So the alligatorlike position of 
the sauropod dinosaurs is by no 
means a new idea, as my corres- 
pondent seemed to assume. It was, 
instead, an early mistake which 
was thoroughly disproved as long 
ago as 1910.

moment, Postmaster Schantz came 
to my rescue. He stuck his head 
through the stamp window and 
bellowed, “It’s a damned dirty

The professor’s thin lips twisted 
into a faintly ironic smile and his

Young Bill Wade was at the con- 
trols, leaving on his rural delivery 
route. I made a mental note to 
ride along with him some day and 
do a story abouthim. The farm- 
ers all admire young Bill. They 
say he can hit a mail funnel from 
five hundred feet altitude. 

“I just had a talk with Sam 
Beyers, 1 ” I said to the professor. 
“He’s taking a full-page ad in 
Sunday’s Gazette. He’s announc- 
ing that his robot now has more 
than eighty students and that all 
of them are making six months’ 
progress with every lesson. He told 
me confidentially that in another 
week you won’t have a student 
left.” 

“I know two students he’ll have 
left,” the postmaster growled. “I’m 
not having my grandchildren tak- 
ing no violin lessons from a robot.” 

“That’s nice of you,” Profes- 
sor Perkins murmured. “But Sam 
Beyers isn't far wrong. This morn- 
ing I had twenty-four students. 
When I get home, there’ll be three 
or four cancellations and then I’ll 
have maybe twenty. Another week 
and I’ll be down to your two 
grandchildren. Why not? Why 
should anyone pay for something 
he can get free?” 

“Sam Beyers is a crook,” the 
postmaster said to me. “You 
shouldn’t take his advertising.” 

“Sam isn’t a bad guy,” I said. 
“I don’t like what he’s doing with 
that robot, but as long as there’s 



nothing improper in his advertis- 
ing, I can’t refuse it” 

The postmaster shook his head 
gloomily. “Maybe if the profes- 
sor would advertise ...” 

“I offered him some free ads,” 
I said. “He wouldn’t take them.” 
“It isn’t necessary,” said the 
professor. “In another week, Bey- 
ers will have almost all my stu- 
dents. In a month or so, I’ll start 
getting them back. I can wait Did 
my music come in?” 

He stretched out long, graceful 
fingers for the slender package of 
music. 

I picked up the Gazettes mail 
and thumbed through it in a hurry 
to see how many checks might be 
enclosed before I hurried off after 
the professor. He was standing at 
the edge of the Waterville Park, 
watching a game of scooter ball. 

As we looked, one of the boys 
got the ball squarely in his firing 
sights and scored a direct hit It 
looked like a triple mark. In fact 
it looked as if the ball would carry 
all the way to the river. It didn’t 
—the wind held it up— but it would 
have made the river on the first 
bounce if it hadn’t been for a 
nervy little red-headed boundary- 
man on a red scooter. He headed 
straight for the water, executed as 
neat a skid as I’ve ever seen right 
on the edge of the bank, and netted 
the ball. He had it jammed in his 
launcher by the time he’d com- 
pleted the skid, and he laid a per-

feet shot right on the central bag. 
The rider was out by three lengths. 

“Neat play,” I said. 

“That Pinky Jones is a live 
one,” Professor Perkins agreed. 

“Student of yours?” I asked. 

HP HE professor grinned. “He 
-*■ was, up until last week. I al- 
most feel sorry for the robot. 
Pinky tries to play with the violin 
upside down. He files the strings 
so they break during the lesson. 
One day he came in with a cricket 
inside his violin. He had it trained, 
somehow, so it would chirp when 
he wanted it to. ‘Professor,’ he 
said, ‘something’s wrong with my 
violin. It makes the funniest tone. 5 
He went through the motions with 
his bow and the cricket chirped. 
‘That’s easily corrected,’ I said. ‘An 
extra twenty minutes a day on the 
exercises.’ That was the last time 
he brought the cricket.” 

The professor laughed, but I 
wasn’t in a laughing mood. “You 
don’t seem to realize how serious 
this Beyers thing is,” I said. 

He shrugged. “Of course it’s 
serious. I lose money, and I can’t 
afford to lose money. But people 
will soon find out that a robot can’t 
give violin lessons. Does a machine 
know when a student needs maybe 
a little more padding on the shoul- 
der? Does it know when a student 
needs a heavier bow? Does it know 
what student needs to be coaxed 
and what one needs a kick in the 



pants? Does it make the student 
know the difference between a 
nicely played phrase and one that 
isn’t? No. No machine can do the 
thousand things any good violin 
teacher has to do. People will find 
that out soon enough, and the 
Beyers robot will go back to the 
factory.” 

“I think you’re wrong,” I said. 
“As long as Beyers is giving the 
lessons free, people will send their 
children to him. What have they 
got to lose? Long before they be- 
come dissatisfied with the robot, 
you’ll have had to give in and 
move on. Just what is Beyers up 
to, anyway?” 

The professor smiled and said 
nothing. 

“I can tell you what I think he’s 
trying to do,” I said. “He wants to 
get rid of you. He’ll give free les- 
sons until he eliminates his com- 
petition, and then he can charge 
whatever he wants. Students will 
have to pay it or lose all the time 
and money they’ve already in- 
vested in their music education. 
He’ll charge double what you 
charge for lessons. He’ll have to, 
to get back his investment in that 
robot. Those things are expensive.” 

The professor looked amused. 
“So you think Beyers is after a 
profit.” 

“It isn’t like Sam,” I admitted.

That’s why I don’t understand this 
at all. But how else can you figure 
it?” 

V¥7’E turned together and walked 
™ slowly along Main Street. I 
watched an aircar settle down in 
front of Warren’s Feed Store. A 
burly farmer hurried in, and a 
moment later a robot rumbled out 
with half a dozen bags of feed. 
One of the Warren boys directed 
it from the doorway as it loaded 
the feed into the aircar. 

Half a block down the street, 
we came to Beyers, Inc. Beyers 
sells a little of everything, but 
until lately most of his business 
has been in atomic appliances and 
machinery. This morning he had a 
new, glaring-red sign in the win- 
dow: ALL KINDS OF ROBOTS. 
In the rooms above the store was 
the Beyers School of Music. And 
the robot teacher. 

As we passed the store, the door 
opened and a girl tripped out gaily. 
Her long, golden curls fluttered 
after her as she ran. She wasn’t 
more than ten, yet already a wo- 
manly loveliness was blended with 
angelic, childish mischief in her 
glowing face. It was Sam Bey- 



ers’ daughter Sharon, and she 
darted past us laughing merrily. 
Then she glanced over her shoul- 
der and came to a sudden stop. 

“Hello, Sharon,” the professor 
called. 

She turned sullenly, her eyes on 
the professor. She stuck out her 
tongue. 

“You shouldn’t do that, Sharon,” 
I said. “It isn’t a bit polite.” 

She stuck out her tongue at me 
and hurried away. 

“Now what brought that on?” I 
asked. 

“I’m not very popular with the 
Beyers family,” the professor said. 

“Beyers worships that kid. She’s 
pretty and smart and talented, 
and she’s probably a comfort to 
him after the way his son turned 
out to be a dunce, but he has her 
spoiled rotten. She needs a good 
spanking.” 

“She’s a nice girl,” the profes- 
sor disagreed. 

We stopped suddenly as the 
bright tones of a violin drifted 
down to us. The professor pulled 
on my arm, and we moved away 
from Beyers, Inc., past the fancy 
facade of the Waterville Cafe (Air- 
car Parking in the Rear — Visit 
Our Roof Gardens for Gala Even- 
ing Entertainment), and paused 
to stare unseeing at the glamorous 
young ladies’ frocks in the window 
of Terrestrial Styles Ltd., Water- 
ville Branch. 

“Beethoven,” Professor Perkins

said, his smooth, ageless face taut 
with excitement. “Sonata in C 
Minor, Opus 30, Number 2.” 

“I know,” I told him. “You made 
me play it, once.” 

He nodded. “This robot merits 
some respect. Few teachers know 
the violin’s historical repertory well 
enough to come up with a forgot- 
ten masterpiece by an all but for- 
gotten master.” 

I strained to catch the music. 
“The robot plays well.” 

The professor looked at me 
quickly. “You think so?” 

“It also plays like a robot,” I 
said. 

There was something grimly 
mechanical in its indifference to 
technical barriers, in its rhyth- 
mical severity, in its scorning of 
emotional values. I told myself 
that the students would all play 
like machines. The professor may 
have found some comfort in that, 
but I didn’t. The good people of 
Waterville and the surrounding 
country were not likely to be con- 
cerned about the finer points of 
musical taste and expression — as 
long as their grubby offspring 
played. 

“Come,” said the professor. 

/CROSSING the street, we took 
^ up a position in the doorway 
of Saylor’s Pharmacy and stood 
listening to the dazzling thread of 
violin music that came drifting 
down with the sunlight. The music 



changed several times. I recog- 
nized a passage from an old con- 
certo by Alban Berg and some 
modern pieces by Morglitz. The 
professor listened intently and said 
nothing. 

Precisely on the half-hour, the 
music stopped. A moment later, 
the street door of the Beyers 
School of Music was flung open 
violently. Jeffery Gayman, aged 
eleven, charged out, flung himself 
on the waiting scooter and putted 
away toward the park and the 
game of scooter ball. 

“Now that’s odd,” I said. “I 
didn’t hear him playing once.” 
The professor smiled. “You 
haven’t seen the robot in action 
or heard how it works? I thought 
not. The robot does not play the 
violin. It can’t play the violin. It 
only assists the student.” 

I stared at him. 

“Yes,” he said. “What you heard 
was young Mr. Gayman playing. 
Three weeks ago, he does not even 
play the scales smoothly. He does 
not even play a nice little folk 
song and stay in tune. Then the 
robot gives him two, maybe three 
lessons, and he plays Beethoven 
and Berg and Morglitz like a ma- 
ture artist. The robot is a won- 
derful thing, don’t you think?” 
He laughed and patted me gent- 
ly on the back and hurried away. 

I went back to the Gazette and 
locked myself in my private of- 
fice and settled down to have a 



SPARE THE ROD

good worry. The professor didn’t 
seem greatly concerned about ro- 
bot competition, but as editor of 
the only local newspaper for miles 
around, I knew the people. And 
I knew we were going to lose the 
professor. 

Sam Beyers had plenty of 
money. There wasn’t any limit to 
the time he could go on giving 
free lessons, but there was to the 
time the professor could sit around 
waiting for his students to come 
back to him. Eventually he’d have 
to go where he could earn money 
teaching. 

Water ville needed the profes- 
sor. He was our last remaining 
defender of culture. He’d come 
to Waterville twenty years before, 
when he tired of the high-pres- 
sure life led by artists in the big 
cities. At the time, Waterville 
didn’t seem like a promising place 
for a music teacher. The profes- 
sor was young then — in his early 
forties — and he had plenty of 
drive and enthusiasm. He finally 
got across the idea that art was 
not something to be housed in a 
museum or experienced as a kind 
of passive shower bath from visi- 
scope. The average person could 
learn how to create or recreate art 
for himself. 

“Kids don’t get any physical 
benefit from watching scooter ball,” 
the professor had said. “If you 
want to enjoy the spiritual bene- 
fits of art, you have to participate. 



You can’t just watch it from the 
sidelines.” 

OEOPLE understood that kind 
of talk, and Professor Perkins 
built up a big class of violin stu- 
dents. He also trained some viola 
and cello and bass students, and 
when they were advanced enough, 
he started a string orchestra. He 
conducted it himself, free. If some 
sections needed help for a con- 
cert, he brought professional mu- 
sicians out from the city and paid 
them himself. He gave several re- 
citals a year, and he had his stu- 
dents in regular recitals. He got 
professional accompanists to help 
out, and naturally he had to pay 
them. I knew that the profes- 
sor’s savings couldn’t be large. 
He’d invested too much money in 
culture for Waterville. 

These concerts and recitals were 
events. Everyone in the area had 
at least one relative on the pro- 
gram and everyone came — ad- 
mission free, of course. And it 
didn’t stop there. The professor 
made arrangements for a couple 
of young artists to spend their sum- 
mers in Waterville, giving inexpen- 
sive art lessons to those interested. 
What that cost him, I couldn’t 
guess. When my father died and 
I took over the Gazette , the pro- 
fessor had me sponsoring story 
contests and poetry contests and 
essay contests, and running the 
winners in the Gazette. At least 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




that didn*t cost him anything — I 
put up the prizes myself. 

But the theme was the same: 
don’t watch art from the sidelines 
— have a go at it yourself. With 
the professor pushing it for twen- 
ty years, that philosophy really 
took hold. We had everything 
from wood-carving clubs to oil- 
painting clubs, from poetry-writing 
clubs to musical-composition clubs. 
And the professor was the guar- 
dian angel of each and every one. 
Almost every kid that had grown 
up during the twenty years he’d 
been there had studied an instru- 
ment at one time or another, and 
so had a lot of the adults. The pro- 
fessor had become a local institu- 
tion. Everyone loved him, especial- 
ly the kids. 

It was hard to believe that peo- 
ple would throw him over for some 
novelty like Sam Beyers’ robot, 
after the contribution he had made. 
I suppose the robot had the same 
appeal as a new kitchen or farm- 
ing gadget that everyone rushes 
to buy. There’s something in- 
triguing about a robot that can 
give music lessons. 

And, in addition, the lessons 
were free — and would be, until 
Beyers got rid of the professor. 

Then there was another worry. 
If the robot could actually take 
one of the professor’s beginners 
and have him playing Beethoven 
and Berg and Morglitz after two 
or three lessons . 



I couldn’t come up with an an- 
swer. I told myself that the power 
of the press should be able to ac- 
complish something, but if there 
was a way to use it, I didn’t see 
it. And time was important. I de- 
cided to have another talk with 
the professor. 

r ¥ > HE professor’s small house is 
-*■ out on the edge of town, away 
from any immediate neighbors. 
He wanted it that way, so his 
music lessons wouldn’t bother peo- 
ple. Also, he likes a little extra 
space because, in addition to his 
other talents, he is an amateur 
gardener. In the summer, his yard 
is knee-deep in flowers. 

His daughter Hilda met me at 
the door. There were wrinkles in 
her plump face that I hadn’t seen 
before and her mouth drooped 
mournfully. Obviously she was up- 
set. The professor’s life had been 
comfortably secure, and suddenly 
everything was falling apart. 

“He’s out in back, in the gar- 
den,” she said. “You sit down and 
I’ll call him in.” 

I sat and waited. In most homes, 
it would have been the living room, 
but in the professor’s home it was 
his studio. It was attractively fur- 
nished, with pictures of composers 
on the walls, and a framed page 
of that odd-looking medieval mu- 
sic, and pictures of orchestras the 
professor had once played in. The 
room was air-conditioned, but T

happened to know that it was the 
only air-conditioned room in the 
house. The professor did not waste 
money on physical comforts. His 
money went for culture — Water- 
ville’s culture. 

He came in, a little surprised to 
see me, but eagerly hospitable. 
Hilda faced him glumly. “Mrs. 
Anderson called,” she said. 
“Carol . 

“Ah, yes,” the professor said. 
“Of course. Carol goes to Beyers 
and the robot gives her lessons 
free. Today she has trouble with 
the little exercises, and tomorrow 
she plays a Morglitz concerto with- 
out any mistakes.” He winked at 
me. “The robot is a wonderful 
thing, eh, Johnnie? How many 
does that leave us? Twenty-two?” 
“Twenty-one,” Hilda said. “You 
forgot about Susan Zimmer. Or 
didn’t I tell you?” 

“You didn’t. But it’s quite all 
right. Well, Johnnie? What brings 
you to see an obsolete musician?” 
We sat side by side on the sofa 
and Hilda brought us coffee and 
a small plate of cakes. I sipped 
my coffee, and the professor sipped 
his, and waited politely. 

“What do you know about Bey- 
ers’ robot?” I asked finally. 

“Enough to know what is wrong 
with it,” he said. “I’ve seen similar 
robots demonstrated in New York. 
I know of experiments which have 
been made with them. Beyers’ ro- 
bot may be an improved model, 



but they all have the same basic 
defect.” 

“How do they work? You see, 
I’m trying to put my finger on 
something I could use in the paper. 
In an editorial, perhaps.” 

“You keep on trying, don’t you, 
Johnnie? I’m grateful, of course. 
It isn’t necessary, though, and it 
would really take too much time 
and trouble. But I can tell you 
about it, just to satisfy your re- 
portorial curiosity.” 

TTE got up and helped himself 
to another cup of coffee. “I’m 
not just a selfish old fogy stand- 
ing in the way of progress,” he 
said. “There’s a place for machines 
— yes, even in art there’s a place. 
But the machine cannot replace 
the artist. It can assist him. It can 
stimulate him. It can relieve him 
of some of his mechanical labors. 
But the imagination and the feel- 
ing must come from the artist. 

“Take the nufcic- writer. The 
composer plays, and the music- 
writer writes down what he is 
playing. The machine doesn’t com- 
pose, but it relieves the composer 
of the drudgery of making notes 
on paper. Writers and poets have 
the word-selector. The machine 
doesn’t choose the word. It re- 
minds the writer of the possibili- 
ties, and the writer must make the 
right choice. There are the theater 
amplifiers. The machine can’t 
make emotional expression out of 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




a series of words. All words are 
equal to a machine. But it can de- 
liver the actor’s natural voice to 
the people in the rear so he doesn’t 
have to shout when he should be 
whispering.” 

“How can a machine stimulate?” 
I said. 

“You’ve heard of the composing 
machines?” 

“I thought they were a joke.” 
“They were, as long as they 
were devised to follow a system. 
The music they wrote was perfect- 
ly correct, and horribly dull and 
naive. Then somebody built one 
with no system at all. What it 
produced was absolute chaos, but 
scattered through that chaos were 
beautiful tonal effects that the ma- 
chine happened on by accident. It 
took a great artist to understand 
those effects and use them as they 
should have been. Morglitz used 
that machine in his last composi- 
tions. It inspired some of the great- 
est things he wrote.” 

“I see,” I said. “Then where does 
the robot teacher come in?” 

“It doesn’t. The machine be- 
comes the artist, and the artist be- 
comes the machine. It’s just as if 
— well, take that thing Warren 
uses to carry bags of feed and the 
like. Supposing that instead of ac- 
tually carrying the load, the ma- 
chine merely strengthened a man’s 
spine so he could carry a bigger 
load himself. That’s what the robot 
teacher does. It gives the student 



proficiency without understanding. 
He can carry a bigger load while 
the machine is helping him, but 
take the machine away and he’s no 
better off than he was. Worse, 
maybe.” 

“I still don’t understand,” I said. 

“Well, the robot is not pleasant 
to look at Tentacles all over. It 
tells the student when his violin 
is in tune. It places his fingers and 
arms in the correct position. The 
position is perfect, because the 
robot won’t let it be anything else. 
The student can’t play out of tune, 
or play a wrong note, because 
there’s a tentacle on each finger, 
and the robot won’t let the stu- 
dent put the finger down in the 
wrong place. 

“The robot flashes the music on 
a screen and the student knows 
just what he’s playing, because 
each measure lights up as he gets 
to it, and disappears after he plays 
it. If he bothers to watch the 
screen, he knows. If he doesn’t 
watch it, it doesn’t make any dif- 
ference. The robot won’t let him 
make a mistake. I saw a robot 
demonstrated with some younger 
children who were scared to death 
of the thing. It ignored their cry- 
ing and went right ahead making 
them play.” 

T FROWNED. “That’s bad. I’d 
hate being taught that way as 
a kid.” 

“Actually, the robot doesn’t 



SPARE THE ROD 



95 




teach anything,” the professor said. 
“All it does is use the student like 
an instrument. Without the robot, 
the student can’t play alone any 
better than a violin can play by 
itself. A man in New York did 
some research. He started one 
group of students with a violin 
teacher and another group with 
a robot. At the end of two years 
the teacher’s students were com- 
ing along nicely, and the robot’s 
students couldn’t play a thing. Ex- 
cept with the robot, of course. 
They could play anything with the 
robot.” 

“What if you were to do an 
experiment like that in Water- 
ville?” 

The professor shook his head. 
“Time,” he said. “If I gave lessons 
for nothing, I could get some of 
my students back, or get some 
new students, but it would take 
too long to prove anything.” 

“Is there any chance that the 
robot might be harmful?” 

“Unless it’s used by an expert, 
it might be. And Beyers hasn’t got 
an expert. Muscles have to be de- 
veloped gradually. It is certainly 
not good to force a young per- 
son’s fingers to play difficult music 
before they are ready for it. There 
was a composer named Schumann. 
Nineteenth century. You probably 
haven’t heard of him. He was a 
pianist, and he built some kind of 
gadget to exercise his fingers. He 
ruined his career as a performer.” 



“Was he an important com- 
poser?” I asked. 

“He was fairly important.” 
Suddenly I felt better. “That’s 
something I can use. It makes good 
material for an editorial. ‘Is the 
Robot Harming Our Children?’ 
That’ll make people sit up and 
take notice.” 

He shook his head sadly. “Peo- 
ple never stay sitting up very 
long. Too uncomfortable. No, 
Johnnie. You’d need a lot of re- 
search data and a lot of time.” 

I got up and paced the floor 
restlessly. Hilda came in and 
cleared away the coffee things, and 
then she came back to the door- 
way and stood there wringing her 
hands. 

“What are you going to do?” I 
demanded finally. “Just wait?” 
“Just wait,” he said. “A machine 
cannot replace the artist. Remem- 
ber that. And a teacher — a good 
teacher — is an artist.” 

“I wish I knew what Beyers is 
trying do,” I complained. 

“You know what he thinks of 
his daughter. She’s the smartest 
kid in town. She writes stories and 
poems, and she’s won first prize 
in the last two contests you spon- 
sored. She dances as though gravi- 
ty doesn’t exist. She acts in plays. 
He figures she ought to be mar- 
velous at anything she tries, and 
he sends her to me for violin les- 
sons. I send her home again. She’s 
a lovely girl, and she’s smart and 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




talented, but she’s also tone-deaf. 
The violin is not for a girl who 
can’t hear what she’s playing. 

“Beyers thinks it’s an insult. He 
says her being tone-deaf doesn’t 
make any difference — his girl can 
do anything, and he’ll show me 
I’m wrong if it’s the last thing he 
ever does. So he gets the robot to 
give Sharon lessons, and while he’s 
at it, he gives free lessons to every- 
one and tries to take all my stu- 
dents.” 

“So that’s how it is,” I said. 
“Beyers would naturally hate any- 
one who suggested that Sharon 
wasn’t perfect in every respect. 
But you could have avoided all 
this trouble by just going ahead 
and giving her lessons.” 

“I try to be an honest man, 
Johnnie. There are lots of things 
the girl can do well. She shouldn’t 
waste her time and money on 
the violin.” 

“Well, I’m glad you’re so sure 
things will be all right. I. wish I 
could feel certain about it. I like 
to help things along a little— speed 
them up.” 

H E looked thoughtful. “There’s 
only one way, I think, to 
speed things up. And that’s im- 
possible. I’d have to arrange to 
have the robot give me a lesson, 
but Beyers wouldn’t let me near 
it.” 

“Just what did you have in 
mind?” I wanted to know. 



He shook his head without an- 
swering. 

“If all you want is a lesson,” I 
said, “I can arrange that easily 
enough. Beyers will have to give 
it to you. He’s been advertising 
free lessons for anyone.” 

“He wouldn’t accept me.” 

“If he doesn’t, he’s guilty of 
fraudulent advertising. Here, let 
me call him.” 

I went over to the visiphone and 
cut off the visual transmitter, so 
Beyers wouldn’t know where I 
was. I put through the call and 
got Beyers. 

He laughed and said, “Trouble 
with that ad, I suppose. I should 
have had it typed. No one can 
read my writing.” 

“I have a new student for that 
robot of yours,” I said. “When 
can he come in for a lesson?” 

Beyers was suddenly enthusias- 
tic. He’d been trying to interest 
me in the robot— he thought I 
hadn’t given it the publicity it 
deserved. 

“Send him over,” he said. 
“There’s some time open right 
now.” 

“I’ll bring him myself,” I said, 
and cut off. 

“Let’s go,” I said to the profes- 
sor. 

He picked up his violin. I was 
already nervous by the time we 
got outside the door, and it didn’t 
help me any when the professor 
kept stopping all the way down 



SPARE THE ROD

the walk to admire his pet flowers. 

We panted our way up the stair- 
way to the Beyers School of Music. 
“Beyers says he’s going to put in 
an anti-grav,” I said. “I guess he 
figures this institution is going to 
flourish.” 

At the top, we entered a small, 
comfortably furnished waiting 
room. There was a large color 
photo of Sharon Beyers on the op- 
posite wall. She was lovely and 
doll-like in her dancing costume. 
On the right wall was a black- 
and-white character study of 
Sharon Beyers, beautifully done. 
On the left wall, and the wall be- 
hind us, more Sharon. If Beyers 
ever had a picture made of his 
teen-aged son Wilbur, I never saw 
it. He probably kept it in the stock 
room. 

I walked over and touched a 
button. A moment later, footsteps 
came banging up the stairway and 
Wilbur burst into the room. He is 
kind of an unfortunate happy 
medium — not quite ugly enough 
to be repulsive, not quite intelli- 
gent enough to appear normal. He 
grinned at me, then froze when he 
saw the professor. 

“What’s he doing here?” he 
yelped. 

“I’ve come to take a lesson,” 
the professor said peacefully. “Mr. 
Cranton made an appointment for 
me.” 

Belligerent suspicion gripped 
Wilbur’s young face. It took him 



quite a while to think of the next 
question, and when it came, it 
wasn’t especially brilliant. “What’s 
the big idea?” 

“The idea,” I said, “is that the 
professor is here to take a lesson.” 
“He ain’t no student!” 

“Never too old to learn,” the 
professor said cheerfully. “Don’t 
they teach you that in school? No? 
Such a shame. You’ll be as old as 
I am some day and you should 
remember that. When a man stops 
learning, he’s already dead. So is 
a robot.” 

“I won’t give you a lesson.” 

“Not you,” said the professor. 
“The robot The robot gives me 
the lesson.” 

F OR the second time, Wilbur 
had to grope deeply for his 
words. Finally he said, “I better 
get Dad.” 

His footsteps went slamming 
back down the stairway. He 
slammed back up a little later and 
waited at the top. Sam Beyers 
came up slowly. He is a slight 
quiet-looking man with graying 
hair and a carefully trimmed mus- 
tache. Generally he has a friendly 
smile and a pleasant-looking face, 
but there was nothing pleasant in 
the glance he threw at the profes- 
sor. It was virulent hatred. 

He turned on me. “What’s Per- 
kins doing here?” 

“You told me to bring him over 
for a lesson,” I said. “I brought 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




him. Let’s have the lesson." 

“Let him give himself lessons. 
Out of here, both of you.” 

He was ready to throw us out 
bodily — or make a good try at 
it His face was white, with a dull 
red touch of anger in his cheeks. 
His hands were trembling. I felt 
sorry for him, in a way. I sup- 
pose too much love can easily 
counterbalance itself with too much 
hatred. 

I shrugged and winked at the 
professor. “It’s his business,” I said. 
“Let’s go look up Tom Silvers and 
have him draw up a couple of af- 
fidavits for the District Attorney.” 

It hit Beyers like a splash of 
cold water. He squared his shoul- 
ders and said icily, “I’ll run this 
business the way I want to run 
it.” 

“No, you won’t,” I told him. “For 
three weeks, you’ve been advertis- 
ing free lessons for anyone. If you 
refuse to give the professor a les- 
son, that makes it fraudulent ad- 
vertising. Check that with your 
lawyer.” 

He had himself under control by 
then. The red was gone from his 
cheeks, but the pasty-white color 
that remained wasn’t much of an 
improvement He sat down heavily 
and glared at the professor. “What 
are you after?” 

“Music lessons,” the professor 
said. 

“If he thinks the robot is a good 
thing, he’ll retire,” I explained. 



“You can have all his students.” 

“I’ll get all his students any- 
way,” Beyers said. He meant that, 
too. 

“Maybe not,” I said, “when peo- 
ple start wondering why you won’t 
let him have a lesson.” 

Beyers looked at him slyly. “It 
really might not be a bad idea,” he 
said, half to himself. “If the robot 
can give Perkins lessons, people 
will know it can give anyone les- 
sons.” He jerked erect “Give him 
a lesson, Wilbur. I want to watch 
this myself.” 

Wilbur led the way into the 
next room, the sanctuary of the 
robot, and the rest of us trailed 
along. The professor got out his 
violin and approached his rival 
calmly. The robot stood in the 
center of the room, a stately edi- 
fice of glistening metal and plastic. 
The multitude of metallic ten- 
tacles hung limply at its sides. On 
the back was an imposing control 
panel; on the front was a darkened 
screen and a row of inset signal 
lights. 

T GLANCED sideways at Bey- 
ers. He had already lost interest 
in the proceedings. He’d seated 
himself in the corner and was 
staring across the room at a full- 
sized photo of Sharon. I thought 
to myself, in a few more years that 
girl will be a beauty, and woe to 
the young men who try to court 
her!

Wilbur bustled about nervous- 
ly, measuring the professor and 
fussing with the dials on the back 
of the robot. He adjusted the 
screen to the professor’s eye level 
and edged him forward until his 
shoes slipped into recesses in a 
protrusion of the robot’s base. 
Then he ducked behind the robot, 
giggling. 

“Beginner?” he asked. 

“Anything you like,” the pro- 
fessor said. 

“We’ll call you advanced,” Wil- 
bur announced. He threw a switch 
and the robot hummed quietly. 
The word TUNE flashed on the 
screen. 

The professor scornfully plucked 
his strings, one at a time, and a 
green light flashed as each tone 
sounded. Wilbur stood staring at 
the robot. 

“Wow!” he exclaimed. “Most of 
the kids take ten minutes to get 
green on that.” 

“I believe you,” the professor 
said. 

Music flashed on the screen, but 
he made no motion to raise his 
violin to playing position. The ten- 
tacles suddenly encircled him. As 
I watched in amazement, the robot 
gently positioned the violin for 
him, eased his elbows over to the 
proper angle and raised his bow. 
The violin tone filled the room, a 
brittle, mechanical tone. I knew it 
was not the professor playing. 

He called out above the music,

“I am completely relaxed. I do 
nothing at all and still the robot 
makes me play. You see, Johnnie?” 

“Incredible!” I breathed. 

Off to my left, I heard Sam 
Beyers chuckling quietly. 

“Now I play myself,” the pro- 
fessor said. The tone was instant- 
ly warm and expressive. “Now 
the robot relaxes. But supposing 
I try to make a mistake. Here, you 
see? No mistake. And this fortis- 
simo passage — supposing I try 
to play pianissimo. But it stays 
fortissimo. If I relax, the robot 
puts the necessary pressure on the 
bow.” 

“Incredible!” I said again. 

The music flowed on to the end 
of the exercise. Sometimes it was 
the professor I heard, and some- 
times the robot, and the professor 
kept up a running comment on 
what was happening. Then the 
tentacles dropped away, the screen 
went blank, and the word TUNE 
appeared. The professor stepped 
back. 

Wilbur Beyers giggled proudly. 
Sam walked over and started to 
place his hand on the professor’s 
shoulder. Then he changed his 
mind. The color of his face was 
back to normal, but his smile 
wasn’t much more than a vindic- 
tive glint 

“Do you think my robot can 
teach you a few things, Perkins?” 
he said. 

“It is quite possible,” the pro- 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




fessor declared. “It has already 
given me an idea or two. But the 
tone is bothering me. Would you 
mind if I changed strings?” 

“Of course not. Go right ahead.” 

A S the professor took new 
strings from his violin case, 
voices drifted in from the waiting 
room. Mrs. Karl Anderson stuck 
her blonde head through the door. 
“Is it time for Carol’s lesson? Oh!” 
She stared at the professor. 

“Bring Carol in, Mrs. Anderson,” 
he said. “She has her lesson as 
soon as I finish mine.” He turned 
to Wilbur. “Right?” 

“Right,” Wilbur giggled. He 
winked at Carol, and that young 
lady blushed and scurried over to 
seat herself very primly beside her 
mother. 

“It won’t take much longer,” 
said the professor. “I’ll try maybe 
one more exercise. Does it have 
something difficult?” 

“Sure,” Wilbur said. “I’ll give 
you something good and hard. It’s 
pretty good stuff. I was playing 
it myself yesterday.” 

The professor moved back to 
the robot, took his position and 
plucked his strings. The green 
lights flashed and the music ap- 
peared. 

“Ah!” the professor said. “Paga- 
nini. So you play Paganini, Wil- 
bur. That is wonderful.” 

“Never had a lesson in my life, 
except from the robot.” 



“You don’t say!” 

Beyers broke in, “Sharon plays 
Paganini, too.” 

The professor smiled and the 
tentacles went into action. I leaned 
forward, waiting to see who would 
do the playing — the professor or 
the robot. 

But it was neither. From the 
first few notes, even Sam Beyers 
realized that. He bounded to his 
feet and raced across the room. 
The sounds the violin produced 
were vaguely music, but a clumsy, 
distorted music. Red lights crackled 
on and off. The robot’s faint hum 
became louder. Wilbur buried his 
face in the control panel, mouth 
agape. 

“Something’s wrong,” Beyers 
said. “What’d you do, Wilbur?” 

“There’s — nothing wrong here,” 
Wilbur gasped. 

The robot’s hum became rum- 
bling thunder, punctuated with 
shrieks. The violin labored on and 
the robot’s shuddering vibration 
shook the room. A thin ribbon of 
smoke curled from its base and 
drifted upward. 

“Turn it off!” Beyers shouted. 

Wilbur reached for the switch— 
too late. The robot’s lights went 
off. The screen went blank. The 
tentacles released the professor and 
drooped downward, shaken by an 
occasional spasm. 

“What happened?” the profes- 
sor asked innocently. 

I glanced at him, and saw him

workings hard to suppress a grin. 

Beyers ignored the question. 
“Wilbur,” he snapped, “get Ed up 
here to take a look at this thing.” 

Wilbur scampered away. Smoke 
continued to pour from the base 
of the robot. Beyers hurried over 
and flung open a window. 

“Doesn’t Carol get her lesson?” 
Mrs. Anderson asked. 

“I don’t know,” Beyers said. 
“We’ll have to wait until Ed — 
here he is. Ed, what’s got into 
this thing?” 

Ed shrugged his massive shoul- 
ders and dropped a box of tools on 
the floor. Beyers bent over him 
as he went to work on the robot’s 
backplate. 

“Ed’s really handy with these 
things,” Beyers said. “He can fix 
just about anything.” 

¥7 D twisted off the plate, flashed 
a light into the robot and 
whistled. “Can’t fix that,” he said. 
“What happened? This thing’s real- 
ly burned out” 

“What’s that?” Beyers de- 
manded incredulously. “You can’t 
fix it?” 

“Have to send it back to the fac- 
tory. Needs a whole new unit in 
there.” 

“Doesn’t Carol get her lesson?” 
Mrs. Anderson repeated. 

Beyers gestured helplessly. “I 
guess not. As soon as I get it fixed, 
I'll let you know.” 

“Well, I like that!” said Mrs. 



Anderson indignantly. “How is 
Carol going to learn to play if she 
can’t depend on her teacher? Pro- 
fessor, can you give her a lesson 
today?” 

“You call Hilda,” the profes- 
sor said. “She makes the appoint- 
ments.” 

“Now just a minute,” said Bey- 
ers. “It won’t take long . 

Mrs. Anderson stared him down. 
“The professor charges for his les- 
sons, but at least he’s dependable.” 

“That’s right, Mrs. Anderson,” 
the professor said. “I take cold 
shots and allergy shots and vitamin 
pills, and now and then maybe I 
have a sprained ankle or a cut 
finger. But never yet have I missed 
a lesson because of a blown fuse.” 

Mrs. Anderson left, with Carol 
firmly in tow. The professor patted 
Wilbur on the back consolingly. 
“Such a pity, Wilbur. Maybe you 
wore the robot out playing too 
much Paganini. You let me know 
when you get it fixed and I’ll finish 
my lesson.” 

Sam Beyers reared back and 
pointed a trembling finger. “You’re 
responsible for this, Perkins. I 
don’t know what you did, but I'm 
going to find out, and then I’ll sue 
you for everything you’ve got. I 
know it isn’t much, but I’ll sue 
you for it!” 

“Mr. Beyers,” the professor said 
gently, “I'll give you some friend- 
ly advice. Send the robot back 
and forget about it. It’s a wonder-

ful thing, but it can never be a 
music teacher. I’ve been playing 
for nearly sixty years, and teach- 
ing for fifty, and I know. Robot or 
human being, there can be no 
violin teacher without a sense of 
humor. Shall we go, Johnnie?” 
We went down the stairway and 
walked along Main Street. The 
professor was smiling faintly and 
humming a little tune to himself. 
If I hadn’t been so curious, I could 
have done some singing myself. 

“All right,” I said when I couldn’t 
stand it any longer. “Just how did 
you manage that?” 

“Tricks, Johnnie. In fifty years 
of teaching children music, I’ve 
learned tricks no robot will ever 
know. I even remember a few 
tricks from the time when I was 
a little boy.” 

“That I can believe,” I said. 
“What was this particular trick?” 

STUDIED at a conserva- 
tory when I was young,” the 
professor told me. “Boys will play 
pranks, you know, and once they 
played a prank on me. I was to 
play a little solo in a recital, and 
just before I went on, they took 
my violin and switched all the 
strings around. The strings have 
always been in the same order on 
the violin, maybe from the time 
violins were first made. They go 
from lowest to highest — G, D, 
A, E. The boys switched my strings 
around and put the highest where 



the lowest should have been, and 
the lowest in between somewhere, 
and when they got through, none 
of the strings was where it was 
supposed to be. 

“I knew what they’d done, of 
course, as soon as I got on stage 
and started to tune. But there I 
was, out in front of the audience, 
and the piece I was to play was 
not difficult. I tried to go through 
with it, and it was pretty bad. After 
about five measures, I had to stop, 
so I made a little speech telling the 
audience what had happened, and 
I changed my strings back right 
there on the stage. The audience 
thought it was a good joke. They 
had a good laugh, and when I 
got the violin fixed, I played rather 
well and got a lot of applause. And 
the boys took up a collection and 
bought me a little medal, for 
courage under duress. I still have 
it.” 

“Then when you put on the 
new strings ...” 

“I changed them around. In- 
stead of G, D, A, E, I made them 
E, A, D, G. A human being is the 
most adaptable thing there is, but 
not even an expert human musi- 
cian could adapt to that— not after 
always having the strings in cor- 
rect order. The robot didn’t have 
a chance. Its instruments told it 
the strings were in tune, but 
wherever it directed my fingers, 
the wrong notes came out. All it 
could do was break down. Maybe

I cost Beyers a lot of money, but 
I’m not really sorry. The robot is 
npt good for the students. With it 
doing everything for them, they 
could never learn.” 

“Oh, it won’t cost Beyers any- 
thing,” I said. “He’s too clever for 
that. He’ll have a guarantee on 
the thing, and probably he only 
bought it on approval. But he’ll 
get the robot fixed, and try again, 
and he certainly won’t give you 
another chance to mess it up.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” the profes- 
sor said. “All I really did was 
speed things up a little. It would 
have happened anyway, sooner 
or later. The boys will have their 
little tricks, and it would have 
been the filed strings, or someone 
with vaseline on the bow, the way 
you did once— no, I haven’t for- 
gotten— or a violin with the sound 
post removed, or the strings in 
all different kinds of wrong order, 
and the robot would have gone 
back to the factory. If the boys 
run out of tricks, I can always 
make a little whisper to one of 
Beyers’ students. ‘What would hap- 
pen if you did this?’ The robot 
won’t have to go back to the fac- 



tory many times before the par- 
ents get disgusted with it. A violin 
teacher . 

“I know,” I said. “A violin 
teacher has to have a sense of 
humor.” 

He stopped and grabbed my 
arm. “Johnnie, we rushed things 
too much. We should have waited.” 

“How’s that?” I said. “What’s 
the matter?” 

He looked at me slyly, his eyes 
sparkling, his face wrinkled into 
a- mischievous smile — the smile 
of a small boy who’s been bad and 
knows he won’t be spanked. I told 
myself I’d wasted a lot of worry- 
ing. The professor was a match 
for any robot and he knew it. He 
hoped Beyers would get the thing 
fixed so he could have another 
crack at it. I could imagine him 
getting together with some of his 
boys and saying, “This time we’ll 
try . .” No wonder the kids loved 
him! 

He turned away and shook his 
head sadly. “We should have 
waited. I’d give anything to know 
what the robot would have done 
about Pinky Jones’ trained cricket.”

The Ethical Way 

By JOSEPH FARRELL 

There is a way around every tabu,

that the wood doesn't knock back! 



it time?” Jarth Rolan 
I asked anxiously. Pilot Lan 
■ Barda pushed him gently 
back into a seat. “No, but very 
soon. And be calm— you’re jumpier 
than a human.” 

“But we’ve waited so long— yes, 
a long time. And I am anxious to 
get home.” 

Lan peered calmly out of his 
vehicle. They were hovering in 
Earth’s upper atmosphere, at the 
permitted limit. 

“Be patient. These people have 
almost reached the critical point. 



We’ll get the signal before long.” 
Jarth Rolan popped out of his 
chair and danced about in nervous 
excitement. 

“Won’t it be dangerous? For us, 
I mean. Going down into that 
radioactive atmosphere. And how 
about them— will any of them live? 
Suppose we wait too long?” 

Lan Barda laughed. He was a 
husky humanoid, pinkish of skin 
and completely hairless, like all 
galactics. He slapped Jarth Rolan’s 
back. 

“We have experts watching.

These humans have used four co- 
balt bombs, and plenty of smaller 
stuff. The fallout is close to the 
danger point. Our observers will 
know just when we can move in 
because—” he winked and his voice 
dropped to a conspiratorial whis- 
per— 1 “they're using automatically 
controlled instruments.” 

“Oh, my!” Jarth Rolan clapped 
his hands to his cheeks. “But those 
are robots— and the use of robots 
is against religion.” 

“I know, Jarth. But we won’t 
be using them much' longer, will 
we?” He poked a playful finger 
into Jarth’s ribs. “Well have 
slaves— and it’ll be completely 
ethical.” 

Jarth Rolan winced. “Must you 
use that word ‘slaves,’ Lan? It 
sounds so—” He waved his hands. 

Lan laughed again. “Be honest 
with yourself, Jarth. You’re out to 
make a few dopolins for yourself 
as a slave raider.” 

“An entrepreneur,” said Jarth. 
“In personal services.” 

Lan Barda became serious. 
“There’s the signal— it’s time to 
go down. Let’s go, Jarth, before 
somebody else gets them all.” 

A N hour later, it was Lan Bar- 
da’s turn to be nervous. He 
watched a needle creep into the 
red zone. 

“Hurry, Jarth. We’ve been on 
this planet long enough. That fifth 
cobalt bomb is sending the index 



up fast. Can’t you skip these last 
few?” 

“Oh, no. Very unethical to leave 
these three here to die. Must take 
a small chance, you know. Besides, 
see the sign on that taxi— just mar- 
ried. A fine young couple. And a 
fine young taxi driver. Couldn’t 
sleep if I didn’t help these three.” 
“Couldn’t sleep thinking of the 
profit you’d passed up. Here, let 
me take that one. We have to get 
out of here fast.” 

Jarth Rolan fluttered anxiously 
about the pilot until they were 
safely above the poisoned atmos- 
phere. 

“How many?” he asked. “Did 
we fill the ship?” 

Lan Barda checked off items on 
his clipboard. “A thousand and 
three, with these last ones. You’ll 
make a good profit.” 

“Not so much the profit. Oh, 
no. More than that involved. 
Ethics and religion, Lan. Yes. 
With all these sla— servants, our 
people will never have to use ro- 
bots. They’ll be relieved of routine 
labor and can devote their lives 
to art and science. And it’s all 
ethical— oh, yes, for these people 
were doomed.” 

“Want to know something, 
Jarth?” Lan Barda bent closer and 
whispered wickedly. “This ship has 
automatic controls. Has to. No 
living being has fast enough reac- 
tions to handle an interstellar ship. 
All robot driven, at least in part.”

“RobotsI May we be forgiven!” 
Jarth stared suspiciously at Lan 
Barda. “Sometimes, Lan, I think 
you are an agnostic.” 

The pilot became more serious. 
“Maybe, Jarth. In our work, we 
must use robots. We joke about 
it, but it goes against all galactic 
belief to let a machine think for 
us. Maybe that’s why we pilots 
are so cynical.” 

“A galactic is always ethical,” 
said Jarth Rolan solemnly. “This 
affair, for example. We let these 
poor creatures of Earth handle 
their own affairs with no interfer- 
ence until they doomed them- 
selves. It was unethical to inter- 
vene a minute sooner. Yes— the 
ethical way and I feel better for it 
and proud to be a galactic.” 

“That’s true,” said Lan Barda. 
“A galactic wouldn’t feel right, be- 
ing a member of the dominant 
race of the Galaxy, if he didn't 
help the less fortunate.” 

J ARTH Rolan had prepared a 
center on his estate for the 
slaves. The demand was greater 
than the supply. He chatted hap- 
pily with his wife. 

“An excellent investment, Shal- 
la— yes. And the highest group 
council wants us to lease them out 
by the day for the present instead 
of selling outright.” 

She nodded. “That's the fair 
way. Everybody can have a turn 
having a slave.” 



“And,” said Jarth, rubbing his 
pink hands, “we'll collect every 
day and still hold title.” 

“Will they multiply fast,” asked 
Shalla, “so there will be enough 
for all?” 

“They always did on Earth. Yes. 
By the time we pass our estate 
on to our son, this investment will 
have multiplied in value.” 

At the center, the slaves clus- 
tered about the bulletin boards to 
read the slave code. The three who 
had been brought aboard last 
stood together. Laurent Crotier 
and his wife Jean were still in 
their wedding clothes, and Sam the 
taxi driver was in uniform. They 
read the seven articles of the slave 
code. 

“We have to work twelve hours 
a day,” Laurent observed. “And 
have off every seventh day. This 
could be worse.” 

“We’ll keep our eyes open and 
wait for our chance,” Sam piped 
up. “Some day we’ll make a break 
out of here.” 

“Yeah,” said Jean. “And remem- 
ber, Frenchy, no kids.” 

Nine months later, Laurent, Jr., 
was bom. Before the blessed event, 
Laurent went to Jarth Rolan with 
a complaint. 

“She can’t do it, work twelve 
hours a day now. You have to 
change the rules. By gar, if my 
wife die 'count of this, I goin' kill 
you, Jarth Rolan.” 

Jarth Rolan waltzed about nerv-

ously, biting his fingernails. 

“No, we do not want her to have 
trouble. No. She will need proper 
rest. There is a meeting of the 
highest group council right now, 
concerning this. Others have the 
same problem. But yes, I will 
relieve her of work without wait- 
ing for the council’s decision. Tell 
your wife to stay home, Laurent, 
until the baby is born.” 

Laurent pushed his luck. “And 
after that, too. A kid got to have 
a mother. I do the work for three, 
you let my wife take care of the 
family.” 

“Oh, this is a problem!” Jarth 
Rolan rubbed his fingers unhap- 
pily over his bald scalp. “Some of 
the other females are in the same 
condition. But it is like planting 
a crop — one labors hard at the 
beginning to reap a great harvest 
later. We will work this out.” 

The next day, fifteen articles 
amending the code arrived and 
were posted. Laurent read happily. 

“Now,” he said to Jean, “it is 
the law. You will stay home and 
have the baby.” 

“‘And for such further period’,” 
she read, “‘as is considered neces- 
sary.’ You sure told him off, 
Frenchy.” 

She squeezed his arm affection- 
ately and his chest went out a 
little. 

“And remember,” she said, “this 
is the last one.” 

“Look at this rule,” said Sam. 



“All kids must be educated. Fm 
only—” he winked at them— “thir- 
teen. It’s off the job and back to 
school for me.” 

Laurent blinked. “By gar, Sam, 
I think you been shaving pretty 
near as long as I am. But if Jarth 
Rolan ask me, I say I know Sam 
is thirteen.” 

Jarth Rolan came along to ex- 
plain the amendments. 

“We don’t want the slaves to be 
ignorant. Oh, no. It will be worth 
extra effort and expense to reap 
the harvest. The slaves will work 
at many specialized tasks. Even 
personal servants will read and 
write letters and help at business 
and keep accounts— yes, indeed. 
We must assign some slaves to 
teaching.” 

A BOUT the time Laurent, Jr., 
started school, Laurent led a 
delegation to Jarth Rolan. 

“We got some complaint to 
make. These food servings pretty 
small lately. We work hard, we 
have to eat more.” 

Jarth Rolan’s facial skin had 
developed wrinkles, though the 
galactics’ life span was comparable 
to a human’s and he was only 
about forty. He fidgeted. 

“I am sorry — oh, yes. Sorry. 
There have been delays in food 
shipments— the same trouble all 
over. Too many excused from the 
work force, you know. Most of 
the women are pregnant or have 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




children, and teachers and special 
assignments — but things will im- 
prove, believe me. Yes. You will 
soon find an improvement. Yes- 
very soon.” 

The delegation talked it over 
outside Jarth Rolan’s house. 

“He’s been letting himself go,” 
said a woman. “Did you notice 
how thin he’s become? And the 
same with his family.” 

Laurent reflected. “To raise a 
lot of kids is hard. My father, he 
work like hell all the time. Raise 
his own food, don’t depend on no- 
body. I think that land back of 
the center, we should plough it up 
and put in some potatoes.” 

“On our own time?” Sam ex- 
claimed. 

Laurent chuckled. “Well, Sam, 
you got no kids— you just a young 
boy eighteen years old. By gar, I 
think you have gray hair when 
you twenty-one.” 

The others joined the laughter. 
Sam’s lie about his age had boom- 
eranged — he had been kept in 
school and denied permission to 
marry until he was officially 
eighteen, a few months ago. 

Laurent fingered his chin 
thoughtfully. “I think we look over 
that land. Maybe we get some 
time out from our regular work, 
we do some farming.” 

Before the blowup on Earth, 
the galactics had made occasional 
landings to gather animals and 
seeds of food plants. Certain cen- 



ters were put under government 
control to grow food for the slaves. 
The people at Jarth Rolan’s cen- 
ter saw that this arrangement was 
breaking down because of the in- 
creasing slave population and the 
diversion of labor to child raising. 
They looked over the piece of land 
and Laurent okayed it. They went 
back to Jarth Rolan. He approved 
at once. 

“Oh, indeed. I can obtain all 
the equipment you’ll need. Get 
started right away. We can grow 
a good part of our own food. Yes. 
I am sure it will work out.” 

“We goin’ need some time for 
work the farm,” Laurent pointed 
out. 

“Oh? I thought maybe in your 
spare time—” 

“You want to kill us?” Sam de- 
manded. “Put us on an extra job 
after working us hard twelve hours 
a day?” 

“But — there’s so little coming 
in. Still, maybe you’re right. Worth 
the extra trouble and expense now. 
Building for the future— that’s the 
idea.” 

J ARTH Rolan notified his group 
leader of the arrangement and 
it percolated swiftly up through 
the hierarchy to the council of the 
highest group heads, who directed 
policy for the entire Galaxy. There 
were nine of them and they talked 
over this development. 

“I approve. We should have 



THE ETHICAL WAY 



111 




done it this way from the begin- 
ning.” 

“Of course. But certain advo- 
cates of government control in- 
sisted on public ownership of the 
food farms—” 

“What do you mean, certain 
advocates? If you mean me, be 
galactic enough to say so.” 

“I intend no personal offense to 
anybody. But there is bound to be 
inefficiency in any government 
project—” 

The chairman pounded the 
table. “Stay with the subject. It 
has been suggested that each cen- 
ter grow part of its food. I am in 
favor.” 

“But it cuts down the available 
labor force. We’re having com- 
plaints now about the shortage of 
slaves—” 

“Think of the future. I admit 
the present situation is difficult. 
It’s like raising a herd of prize 
cattle— all expense and no profit 
at first. Then the herd is built up 
and suddenly you’re rich.” 

“But we’re putting so much into 
it—” 

“The more we put in, the more 
we take out. And they’re multiply- 
ing rapidly. Remember our new 
goal of two slaves for each galac- 
tic— one for the day shift and one 
for the night. It’s the only way our 
people can live a decent life, freed 
from routine labor, devoting them- 
selves to art and science.” 

“That’s right. We work so our 



children can lead the better life. 
It’s worth some sacrifice.” 

The chairman stood up. “Most 
of us seem willing to endure a little 
hardship now for the benefit of our 
children. I suggest we endorse this 
new procedure.” 

T AURENT, Jr., married the girl 
next door. Laurent celebrated 
the wedding with a barrel of beer 
he had brewed on the farm. Sam 
became glassy-eyed and lectured 
the young couple. 

“Just wait for the right time. 
Rise up and capture their space- 
ships. That’s what we’ll do. We’ll 
go back to Earth and then let 
them try to get us off it again.” 
“But Earth is dead,” Laurent, 
Jr., objected. “We can’t live there. 
Poisonous radiation.” 

“By gar!” Laurent drained an- 
other brew. “You believe every- 
thing they tell you, hah? We goin’ 
show them sometime. Like Sam 
says, not now, but sometime. 
Maybe me and Sam don’t do it, 
but don’t you kids forget— you not 
goin’ be slaves always. You watch 
for the right time, like Sam says.” 
His son looked dubious. “But 
what you told me about Earth 
doesn’t sound so good. Like the 
way you were so cold and hungry 
in that shack in Canada. And 
Mama walking up five flights in 
New York after working all day 
in the garment factory. And all 
those wars! Why did you people

spend half your time shooting each 
other, Dad?” 

Laurent belched indignantly. 
“By gar, boy! We was free! We 
don’t have no galactic stand over 
us, do this, do that. We was free!” 

“We don’t work so hard,” said 
his son. “And look at old Jarth 
Rolan and the others out there— 
they’ve given us the day off, but 
the galactics are all busy in the 
fields. Everybody has to work, 
Dad.” 

Laurent looked through a slight 
haze at the masters laboring in the 
potato fields. Farm work and 
teaching and other special assign- 
ments had created a shortage of 
personal slaves. Jarth Rolan gave 
preference in leasing slaves to 
those who came and helped him 
at the center. 

Since having a personal slave 
was a mark of prestige among the 
galactics, many of those laboring 
on the farm were from the highest 
levels of society. 

“They don’t know nothing about 
raise potatoes,” Laurent grumbled. 
“We put in complaint, by damn. 
We want each one have his own 
land. I work like jackass, I want 
to get paid for it.” 

r T , HE highest group council was 
in session. One member was 
explaining: “It’s the custom of tip- 
ping slaves. At first, those who 
could get a slave were so happy 
that they often gave him a few 



coins. Now the custom is firmly 
established — anybody who doesn’t 
tip a slave is considered cheap. I 
do it and so do you.” 

“Of course. What’s wrong with 
giving them a few polins now and 
then? Or a dopolin or two when 
they have a baby or a wedding?” 
“Nothing wrong with it, in itself. 
But they don’t spend anything. We 
supply their food and clothing; 
nothing else we have seems to ap- 
peal to them. The money goes out 
of circulation. It’s estimated that 
half the money in the Galaxy is 
being hoarded by slaves.” 

“What? That’s impossible. Just 
from those small tips?” 

“Small tips, but day after day; 
year after year. Add up some time 
what you’ve given and multiply 
by the number who’ve been doing 
it.” 

“Then that’s behind our eco- 
nomic troubles. A currency short- 
age. Can we take it away from 
them?” 

“Of course not. Besides being 
unethical, it would turn them 
against us. They wouldn’t under- 
stand.” 

“Then we’ll abolish tipping.” 
“Too late. What we need is an 
ethical way of getting back that 
currency.” 

A new member spoke: “I un- 
derstand that on Earth these slaves 
were often addicted to alcohol, 
gambling and various alkaloids. 
Perhaps we could introduce these 



114

items, under government control, 
of course—” 

He stopped. Eight pair of eyes 
were blazing at him. 

“You’re new here,” the chair- 
man said. “If you ever make an- 
other suggestion like that—” 

They pondered. The chairman 
fingered some papers. 

“Here’s a suggestion. The slaves 
have been petitioning for the right 
to own land. It seems to be the 
only thing they’ll spend their 
money for.” 

“Impossible!” 

“But maybe—” 

“We could limit the holdings.” 
“And have the land subject to 
condemnation by the government 
at a fair price.” 

The chairman called for order. 
“Let’s argue this out. Remember 
the slaves will need time to work 
their land. Since their work day is 
down to nine hours, we’ll have to 
arrange something.” 

J EAN had been complaining 
about the lumps in the mat- 
tress. When Laurent took them 
out, there was enough in galactic 
currency to buy a piece of land 
in his name and hers, plus a plot 
for each of the children, and a new 
mattress as well. Sam was sus- 
picious. 

“They’re out to get what little 
we’ve been able to save, Laurent 
They can take the land anytime— 
for what they call a fair price. 



Fair! Fine chance they’ll be fair 
about it” 

But Laurent kept the land and 
was even able to buy a piece for 
each grandchild, although they ar- 
rived faster and faster as his own 
large family grew up and married. 
One day Jean called him to a 
new house at the edge of the wide- 
ly expanded center to see the 
latest arrival. 

Laurent poked a finger at the 
squalling creature. “So I’m an- 
other grandpa. Which one this?” 
“This time you’re a great-grand- 
pa, Frenchy. This is Laurent 4th.” 
“You mean we gettin’ that old? 
By damn! Well, I’m buy him a 
piece of land, too. So much new 
building, this land be worth plen- 
ty when he grows up ” 

The 512th amendment per- 
mitted slaves to retire at 65. Lau- 
rent was a leading real estate 
dealer by that time. He had twen- 
ty-three children and more grand- 
children than he could count. The 
center was grown to a city, its 
main street running through what 
had been his first farm. Sometimes 
Laurent relaxed in his rocking 
chair and needled Sam. 

“By gar, Sam, if you not the 
oldest-looking man of fifty-five I 
ever see. I think you a hundred 
years old when you retire. When 
you havin’ that revolution?” 

“The day will come if we keep 
after the young ones. But damn 
it, Laurent, it’s hard to talk any 



THE ETHICAL WAY

sense into them. Some of them 
can’t even understand me.” 

“Well, they all talk galactic, 
Sam. My grandson, he call himself 
Loran Kotay. But these young 
people, they have to live their own 
lives. Hey, look at old Jarth Ro- 
lan up there, washing his win- 
dows. Old guy should retire, Sam. 
I’m goin’ see a couple of my boys 
give him a hand.” 

IDUT Jarth Rolan died before 
" he could afford to retire and 
was replaced by his only grand- 
son, Jarro Kogar. Laurent and 
Jean passed on shortly after, leav- 
ing nearly four hundred descend- 
ants. 

Jarro Kogar was a newly mar- 
ried galactic in his early thirties. 
He moved into the mansion and 
talked things over with his wife. 

“Don’t see how we can afford 
a child right now. Wouldn’t be fair 
to the child. Things will improve 
in a few years.” 

“Of course,” she said. “We’re 
young— we’ll have time to start our 
family. If we wait, we’ll be able 
to give them more.” 

They held similar conversa- 
tions later and one day realized 
it was too late. Jarro Kogar died 
in his sixties. His widow directed 
the center for several more years. 
The slaves liked her and took good 
care of her. She left them the es- 
tate when she died. 

Loran Krotalu protested to the 



authorities that the slaves didn’t 
want the estate. But the group 
heads ruled it legal under amend- 
ment 1,486, especially since no 
relatives could be located. 

Loran left the center and moved 
to another city where he found a 
galactic couple who wanted a 
slave. He and his family served 
the galactic couple for many years. 
This couple, like Jarro Kogar and 
his wife, were childless and when 
they both died, Loran and his wife 
were very grieved. 

After the funeral, Loran went 
into the city. He returned hours 
later, tired and depressed. 

“It’s no use,” he told his wife. 
“There’s not an unattached galac- 
tic in the area. We might get a 
few hours work a week with one, 
but we can’t have one to our- 
selves.” 

“But, Loran, everybody in our 
set works for a galactic!” 

“I know,” he said miserably. 
“But it’s no use. There must be 
fifty slaves for every galactic. I’ve 
taken a job at the spaceship fac- 
tory. It’s the best I can do.” 

Tl/TEMBERSHIP on the highest 
ITi group council had become a 
killing job. Chief problem was the 
revision of the slave code, which 
had 3,697 articles. After trying for 
years to simplify the code, the 
council members called in Loran 
Krovalo to fill a vacancy and take 
over the job. 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Loran was known and liked by 
galactic and slave alike for his 
brilliant essays on the master-slave 
relationship. While he was on the 
council, the Cerberan affair broke 
out. The Cerberans, an intelligent 
saurian race from a globular clus- 
ter, exploded into the Galaxy in 
vast numbers. Military action be- 
came necessary. 

“We can handle them,” Loran 
told the council. “Our factories are 
mobilized and we have any num- 
ber of spacemen. We have robot 
instruments for fighting that are 
better than anything they have. 
We can carry the war to their 
home planets.” 

Some of the galactics objected. 

“But the use of robots is for- 
bidden. We can’t fight the Cer- 
berans with robot - controlled 

weapons.” 

“Don’t worry, sir,” Loran said 
kindly. “We slaves will take care 
of it. Our form of religion doesn’t 
prohibit robots unless they are in 
the shape of a man. We think of 
real robots as being human in 
shape.” 

One of the galactics rose. 

“I know you’re right, but my 
conscience won’t let me vote for 
robots in any form. Therefore I 
am resigning from the council.” 

A second rose, then a third and 
fourth. They looked at each other, 
and one spoke for the group. 

“We are also resigning. I sug- 
gest that four slaves be appointed 



in our places for the duration of 
the war. Then they will have a 
majority and no galactic need vio- 
late his conscience by voting for 
the use of robots.” 

The Cerberans were crushed, 
but the infested area was huge and 
the invasion of the globular clus- 
ter took time. The war emergency 
lasted fifty years. When it was 
over, the slaves called on the galac- 
tics to take back control of the 
government 

But the widespread use of ro- 
bot mechanisms in the war had 
caused a reaction among the galac- 
tics. Their consciences simmered 
and a wave of orthodoxy swept 
over their race. There was diffi- 
culty in persuading galactics to 
leave their home planets to sit 
on the council, because faster-than- 
light ships used robot controls. 

The slaves scoured the planet 
that housed the council and kept 
two or three seats filled with galac- 
tics for a while. But they were 
generally old, and they died, and 
most of them were unmarried or 
childless. 

L ORAN Crotay, twelfth-genera- 
tion slave, sat in his home 
chatting with a friend from far- 
off Pomalu VI. Being in the space- 
shipping business, he had many 
friends throughout the Galaxy. 

His wife answered the door and 
a pink humanoid shuffled in, 
mumbling greetings, and went into 



THE ETHICAL WAY

the other room. He was middle- 
aged, studious and bespectacled, 
and he wore a wig. Loran’s friend 
watched him curiously. 

“Haven’t seen one of them in 
years, Loran. We have a reserva- 
tion for the poor devils on my 
planet. Don’t reproduce very fast, 
you know, and they may become 
extinct. Too bad— they’re so lik- 
able. Always so ethical and con- 
scientious.” 

“I know.” Loran nodded. “We 



let poor Vendro make a few dopo- 
lins tutoring our son. He’s very 
intelligent and a good teacher. I 
like to help them all I can— the 
only ethical thing to do. I wouldn’t 
feel like a slave if I didn’t give 
poor Vendro a break.” 

“Thafs true,” said his friend. 
“A slave wouldn't feel right, being 
a member of the dominant race of 
the Galaxy, if he didn’t help the 
less fortunate.”

FORECAST 



Safe outside the cosmos, touching neither space nor time, the Place 
is intended as a refuge for Soldiers after their raids on history — and 
pre-history and post-history, for the Change War ranges from the begin- 
ning of Creation to the end — or, despite the Conservation of Reality, 
may make it something that never even happened! But that is merely the 
ultimate fear of the grimly gay occupants of the Place. Change Death is 
more personal and likely — and it strikes in next month's volcanic con- 
clusion of Fritz Leiber's THE BIG TIME — when mutiny turns the Place into 
a bomb in a bag! 

With anything as large both in size and scope as the Leiber serial, 
it's hard to forecast the escort stories, but there will be one and possibly 
two novelets, plus, of course, short stories and our regular features . 
and Willy Ley in combat with an exasperating law of human nature. 

THE BIG TIME, as noted above, deals with the Conservation of Reality; 
Ley's THE ISLAND OF THE STONE HEADS contends with the Conservation 
of Superstition . according to Shaw, the dispelling of one myth creates 
a vacuum into which an equivalent amount of nonsense must rush. Ley 
has more than enough cold facts to collapse a whole Sunday supplement 
legend. Now here's the interesting test: Will the legend collapse ... or 
will hurriedly improvised mythology pour in to support the silly but unspeak- 
ably tough bubble ... or will a completely new legend rise out of the 
fragments of the old?

ON THE BEACH by Nevil Sbute. 
William Morrow and Co., N. Y., 
$ 3.95 

r T'HE theme of the decline and 
end of civilization has been 
done to the point of exhaustion 
in SF and several times in main- 
stream literature. However, in this 
novel of the final atomic war’s 
tragic aftermath, the demise is 
handled with uncommon power. 

The story depicts the nine 
months of life left to Commander 
Dwight Towers, U.S.N., and those 
individuals, mainly Australian, 
whose lives are tied up with his 



command of the Scorpion, one of 
the last two operational vessels 
of the U.S. Navy. 

Submerged for several days 
during the course of a routine mis- 
sion in his atomic-powered sub- 
marine, Towers emerges near 
Manila to find radioactivity far 
above the lethal level. Shortly after, 
radio silence enshrouds the entire 
northern hemisphere except for 
one transmitter near Seattle that 
sends out intermittent, garbled sig- 
nals. The lightning war is over. 

Lacking official orders, Towers 
has placed his vessel under Aus- 
tralian authority at Melbourne. His

liaison officer is a young Aussie 
with wife and infant daughter, at 
whose home he spent several days 
while the sub was outfitted for a 
survey into contaminated northern 
waters. His own Connecticut fami- 
ly has undoubtedly been wiped 
out along with the entire U.S., but 
his methodical, unimaginative mind 
refuses to encompass the thought. 

After the initial shock from sci- 
ence^ conclusion has faded that 
fallout from the world wind cur- 
rents will end all life in the south- 
ern hemisphere, even though Aus- 
tralia was never bombed, life goes 
on much as it did before. The 
majority finds it easier to continue 
working rather than wait, even 
to conducting the hopeless recon- 
naissance. 

Despite the enormity of his 
theme, Shute’s characters are ordi- 
nary people and their dilemma has 
all the more impact for it. Even 
hardened veterans of countless fic- 
tional Armageddons will find this 
an emotional wallop. It should be 
made mandatory reading for all 
professional diplomats and politi- 
cos.

-“•-■-an unappreciative review of 
Maine’s mainly nonsensical sci- 
ence-detection The Isotope Man, I 
was unprepared for this grim, ma- 



ture yam of the first Moon flight. 
Maine has come of age without 
previous hint of maturing. 

Despite the almost fanatic at- 
tention to detail that the Western 
Federation Astronautics Commis- 
sion has devoted to the project, for 
some reason the Alpha has been 
moonwrecked with three survivors 
among the four-man crew. And 
also despite the indoctrination of 
the crew on the prime hazard of 
the spaceman, vacuum, the ship 
has pancaked into a lethally radio- 
active crater. 

The engineer is killed in the 
crash and the doctor-navigator 
crippled by a compound fracture 
of the leg. Caird, the commander, 
and Patterson, electronics, are 
physically fit, but they must es- 
tablish a base outside the crater 
for survival, even though it means 
living within spacesuits. Only short 
intervals for eating and other func- 
tions to be performed in the oxy- 
genated but contaminated ship can 
be chanced. Also, the crippled doc- 
tor must be carried back and forth 
from base to ship. 

The cause of the crash is an 
unconscious girl stowaway, fiancee 
of the dead man; her added weight 
overbalanced the fuel safety fac- 
tor. 

Patterson is for eliminating her 
without compunction, since the 
oxygen will only last a couple of 
weeks for all and six weeks must 
elapse before help arrives. 

All this makes for a melodra-

THE MAKING OF A MOON by 
Arthur C. Clarke. Harper & Broth- 
ers, N. Y., $3.50 

C LARKE has lifted his head 
from the sea bottom long 
enough to give us this breezy ac- 
count of how we stand at present 
with regard to the space satellite. 
Not only that— he has gone into 
its pre-history and the technical 
developments in rocketry leading 
up to the satellite itself. 

Although one would think that 
there cannot possibly be anything 
new to add to all that has been 
written since the President’s an- 
nouncement of the IGY, no one 
has yet penned the definitive book. 
Also, advances are being made so 
rapidly that a book is obsolescent 
before it is printed. Nevertheless, 
Clarke’s comes closest to being the 
ideal popularization. 

One thing he has succeeded in 
doing with hardly any exertion is 
destroying the myth of the space 
station’s invulnerability. The only 
requirement is Napoleon’s famous 
“whiff of grapeshot,” shrapnel, 
which would eventually perforate 
the station like Swiss cheese, 
whether the initial shot hit or 
missed. After all, meeting the 
shrapnel head-on every hour and 
a half is bound to make the sta- 



tion a sitting duck with expendi- 
ture of just one shot. 

Comforting thought, with Rus- 
sia’s satellites overhead. 

MAN INTO SPACE by Hermann 
Oberth. Harper & Brothers, N. Y., 
$4.50 

T>ERHAPS nobody is better 
qualified to jump on the 
“space” bandwagon than Oberth — 
to compound a metaphor, he wrote 
the original music. In 1923, he 
published his first book, By Rocket 
into Planetary Space, an extra- 
ordinary volume which is still 
technically valid. During and after 
the war years, the legendary 
Oberth was lost to view, but he has 
recently been brought to this coun- 
try by a former protege, Werner 
von Braun. 

Unlike Clarke, Oberth’s sole con- 
cern is Man in Space. Before read- 
ing this book, I was quite con- 
vinced that I was briefed on every 
aspect of the conquest of space in 
the immediately foreseeable future. 
However, Oberth’s imagination is 
fully as fertile as it was in 1923. 

His visualization of the space- 
suit as shaped by technological re- 
quirements is enough to make a 
gibberer of any Hollywood prop 
man, as would his space station 
built between two rockets rotat- 
ing around a common center at op- 
posite ends of an 8600-yard steel 
cable. As for his electric spaceships

Herr Oberth, however, is stone- 
cold sober and he has added a 
mathematical appendix for skeptics 
who find his concepts on the wild 
side. 

Oberth’s book is a good deal 
more exciting and provocative 
than some of today's SF novels.

to three questions.” Mr. Cogswell 
wants me to pass them on to other 
profs and instructors: 

Q. Should the franchise be ex- 
tended to 18-year-olds? 

A. Yes. If they are old enough 
to fight, they’re old enough to 
vote. 

Q. Should women be drafted in 
case of war? 

A. No. A woman’s place is in the 
home. 

Q. Should college football be 
abolished? 

A. No. Football builds character. 

Evidently the universities are 
getting special attention; here is 
a mimeographed publicity release 
someone received: “Recently a 
Midwestern college professor 
stepped before his senior class in 
modern languages, took a deep 
breath and said: 

“‘Crashes! Water larder warts

witch.’ 

“Not only did the class agree, 
but” . 

The rest gets incomprehensible. 
In the glimpses of garishly ad- 
vanced science, there is no com- 
fort whatever. The Congressional

Theodore Sturgeon asks: “Have 
you noticed how perforated paper

Eventually, he says, we’ll have 
a paper “of infinite strength com-

Or is the idea to make us ruin 
paper?

A FEAST OF DEMONS 



Illustrated by DILLON 

By WILLIAM MORRISON 



I 

T HAT year we were all 
Romans, and I have to tell 
you that I look awful in 
a toga and short sword, but not 
nearly as awful as the Greek. 

You go to one of the big schools 
and naturally you turn out for the 
Class Reunion. Why not? There’s 
money there, and good fellowship, 
and money, and the chance of a 
business contact that will do you 
some good. And money. 

Well, I wasn’t that fortunate — 
and you can say that again be- 
cause it’s the story of my life: I 
wasn’t that fortunate. 

I didn’t go to Harvard, Prince- 
ton or Yale. I didn’t even go to 
Columbia, U.C.L-A. or the Univer- 
sity of Chicago. What I went to 
was Old Ugly. Don’t lie to me— 
you never heard of Old Ugly, not 
even if I tell you it’s Oglethorpe 
A. & M. There were fifty-eight of 
us in my graduating class — that’s 
1940 — and exactly thirty turned 
up for the tenth reunion. 

Wouldn’t that turn your stom- 
ach? Only thirty Old Grads with 



enough loyalty and school feeling 
to show up for that tenth reunion 
and parade around in Roman togas

In fact, at the feast that even- 
ing, I found myself sitting next 
to El Greco. There simply wasn’t 
anyone else there. You under- 
stand that I don’t refer to that 
Spanish painter — I believe he’s 
dead, as a matter of fact I mean 
Theobald Greco, the one we called 
the Greek. 

¥ INTRODUCED myself and 
he looked at me blearily 
through thick glasses. “Hampstead? 
Hampstead?” 

“ Virgil Hampstead,” I reminded 
him. “You remember me. Old 
Virgie.” 

He said, “Sure. Any more of that 
stuff left in the bottle, Old Virgie?” 

I poured for him. It was my im- 
pression, later borne out by evi- 
dence, that he was not accustomed 
to drinking. 

I said, “It’s sure great to see 
all the fellows again, isn’t it? Say, 
look at Pudge Detweiler there! 
Ever see anything so comical as 
the lampshade he’s wearing for 
a hat?” 

“Just pass me the bottle, will 
you?” Greco requested. “Old Vir- 
gie, I mean.” 

“Still in research and that sort 
of thing?” I asked. “You always 
were a brain, Greek. I can’t tell 
you how much I’ve envied you 
creative fellows. I’m in sales my- 
self. Got a little territory right here 
that’s a mint, Greek. A mint. If 
I only knew where I could lay 



my hands on a little capital to 
expand it the way— But I won’t 
bore you with shop talk. Whafs 
your line these days?” 

“I’m in transmutation,” he said 
clearly, and passed out face down 
on the table. 

Now nobody ever called me a 
dope— other things, yes, but not a 
dope. 

I knew what transmutation 
meant Lead into gold, tin into 
platinum, all that line of goodies. 
And accordingly the next morn- 
ing, after a certain amount of 
Bromo and black coffee, I asked 
around the campus and found out 
that Greco had a place of his own 
not far from the campus. That 
explained why he’d turned up for 
the reunion. I’d been wondering. 

I borrowed cab fare from Old 
Pudge Detweiler and headed for 
the address I’d been given. 

■ It wasn’t a home. It was a beat- 
up factory and it had a sign over 
the door: 

T. GRECO 

Plant Foods & Organic Supplies 

S INCE it was Sunday, nobody 
seemed to be there, but I 
pushed open the door. It wasn’t 
locked. I heard something from 
the basement, so I walked down 
a flight of steps and looked out 
into a rather smelly laboratory. 

There was the Greek. Tall, thin, 
wide-eyed and staggering, he ap- 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




peared to be chasing butterflies. 

I cleared my throat, but he 
didn’t hear me. He was racing 
around the laboratory, gasping and 
muttering to himself, sweeping at 
empty air with what looked to me 
like an electric toaster on a stick. 
I looked again and, no, it wasn’t 
an electric toaster, but exactly 
what it was defied me. It appeared 
to have a recording scale on the 
side of it, with a needle that flick- 
ered wildly. 

I couldn’t see what he was chas- 
ing. 

The fact was that, as far as I 
could see, he wasn’t chasing any- 
thing at all. 

You have to get the picture: 
Here was Greco, racing Ground 
with one eye on the scale and one 
eye on thin air; he kept bumping 
into things, and every now and 
then he’d stop, and stare around 
at the gadgets on the lab benches, 
and maybe he’d throw a switch 
or turn a dial, and then he’d be 
off again. 

He kept it up for ten minutes 
and, to tell you the truth, I began 
to wish that I’d made some better 
use of Pudge Detweiler’s cab fare. 
The Greek looked as though he’d 
flipped, nothing less. 

But there I was. So I waited. 

And by and by he seemed to 
get whatever it was he was look- 
ing for and he stopped, breathing 
heavily. 

I said, “Hi there, Greek.” 



He looked up sharply. “Oh,” he 
said, “Old Virgie.” 

He slumped back against a 
table, trying to catch his breath. 

“The little devils,” he panted. 
“They must have thought they’d 
got away that time. But I fixed 
them!” 

“Sure you did,” I said. “You 
bet you did. Mind if I come in?” 
He shrugged. Ignoring me, he 
put down the toaster on a stick, 
flipped some switches and stood 
up. A whining sound dwindled 
and disappeared; some flickering 
lights went out. Others remained 
on, but he seemed to feel that, 
whatever it was he was doing, it 
didn’t require his attention now. 

In his own good time, he came 
over and we shook hands. I said 
appreciatively, “Nice-looking lab- 
oratory you have here, Greek. I 
don’t know what the stuff is for, 
but it looks expen— it looks very 
efficient.” 

He grunted. “It is. Both. Expen- 
sive and efficient.” 

I laughed. “Say,” I said, “you 
were pretty loaded last night 
Know what you told me you were 
doing here?” 

He looked up quickly. “What?” 
“You said you were in transmu- 
tation” I laughed harder than 
ever. 

TIE stared at me thoughtfully, 
and for a second I thought- 
well, I don’t know what I thought, 



A FEAST OF DEMONS 



127 




but I was worried. He had a lot 
of funny-looking things there, and 
his hand was stretching out toward 
one of them. 

But then he said, “Old Virgie.” 

“That’s me,” I said eagerly. 

“I owe you an apology,” he 
went on. 

“You do?” 

He nodded. “I’d forgotten,” he 
confessed, ashamed. “I didn’t re- 
member until just this minute that 
you were the one I talked to in 
my senior year. My only confidant. 
And you’ve kept my secret all 
this time.” 

I coughed. “It was nothing,” I 
said largely. “Don’t give it a 
thought.” 

He nodded in appreciation. 
“That’s just like you,” he remi- 
nisced. “Ten years, eh? And you 
haven’t breathed a word, have 
you?” 

“Not a word,” I assured him. 
And it was no more than the 
truth. I hadn’t said a word to any- 
body. I hadn’t even said a word 
to myself. The fact of the matter 
was, I had completely forgotten 
what he was talking about. Kept 
his secret? I didn’t even remem- 
ber his secret. And it was driving 
me nuts! 

“I was sure of you,” he said, 
suddenly thawing. “I knew I could 
trust you. I must have — other- 
wise I certainly wouldn’t have told 
you, would I?” 

I smiled modestly. But inside I 



was fiercely cudgeling my brain. 

He said suddenly, “All right, 
Virgie. You’re entitled to some- 
thing for having kept faith. I tell 
you what I’ll do— I’ll let you in 
on what I’m doing here.” 

All at once, the little muscles 
at the back of my neck began to 
tense up. 

He would do what? “Let me in” 
on something? It was an unpleas- 
antly familiar phrase. I had used it 
myself all too often. 

“To begin with,” said the Greek, 
focusing attentively on me, “you 
wonder, perhaps, what I was doing 
when you came in.” 

“I do,” I said. 

He hesitated. “Certain — par- 
ticles, which are of importance to 
my research, have a tendency to go 
free. I can keep them under a 
measure of control only by means 
of electrostatic forces, generated 
in this.” He waved the thing that 
looked like a toaster on a stick. 
“And as for what they do — well, 
watch.” 

"E 1 L Greco began to putter with 
gleamy, glassy gadgets on one 
of the tables and I watched him 
with, I admit, a certain amount 
of suspicion. 

“What are you doing, Greek?” 
I asked pretty bluntly. 

He looked up. Surprisingly, I 
saw that the suspicion was mutual; 
he frowned and hesitated. Then 
he shook his head. 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“No,” he said. “For a minute I 
— but I can trust you, can’t I? 
The man who kept my secret for 
ten long years.” 

“Of course,” I said. 

“All right.” He poured water out 
of a beaker into a U-shaped tube, 
open at both ends. “Watch,” he 
said. “Remember any of your col- 
lege physics?” 

“The way things go, I haven’t 
had much time to keep up with—” 
“All the better, all the better,” 
he said. “Then you won’t be able 
to steal anything.” 

I caught my breath. “Now 
listen—” 

“No offense, Virgie,” he said 
earnestly. “But this is a billion 
dollars and — No matter. When it 
comes right down to cases, you 
could know as much as all those 
fool professors of ours put together 
and it still wouldn’t help you steal 
a thing.” 

He bobbed his head, smiled ab- 
sently and went back to his gleamy 
gadgets. I tell you, I steamed. That 
settled it, as far as I was concerned. 
There was simply no excuse for 
such unjustified insults to my 
character. I certainly had no in- 
tention of attempting to take any 
unfair advantage, but if he was 
going to act that way . 

He was asking for it Actually 
and literally asking for it 

He rapped sharply on the U- 
tube with a glass stirring rod, seek- 
ing my attention. 



“I’m watching,” I told him, very 
amiable now that he’d made up 
my mind for me. 

“Good. Now,” he said, “you 
know what I do here in the plant?” 
“Why — you make fertilizer. It 
says so on the sign.” 

“Ha! No,” he said. “That is a 
blind. What I do is, I separate op- 
tical isomers.” 

“That’s very nice,” I said warm- 
ly. “I’m glad to hear it, Greek.” 
“Shut up,” he retorted unexpec- 
tedly. “You don’t have the fog- 
giest notion of what an optical 
isomer is and you know it. But try 
and think. This isn’t physics; it’s 
organic chemistry. There are com- 
pounds that exist in two forms— 
apparently identical in all respects, 
except that one is the mirror image 
of the other. Like right-hand and 
left-hand gloves; one is the other, 
turned backwards. You understand 
so far?” 

“Of course,” I said. 

TTE looked at me thoughtfully, 
then shrugged. “No matter. 
They’re called d- and 1-isomers — 
d for dextro, 1 for Ievo; right and 
left, you see. And although they’re 
identical except for being mirror- 
reversed, it so happens that some- 
times one isomer is worth much 
more than the other.” 

“I see that,” I said. 

“I thought you would. Well, 
they can be separated— but it’s ex- 
pensive. Not my way, though. 



A FEAST OF DEMONS 



129 




My way is quick and simple. I 
use demons.” 

“Oh, now, Greek. Really.” 

He said in a weary tone, “Don’t 
talk, Virgie. Just listen. It won’t 
tire you so much. But bear in 
mind that this is simply the most 
trifling application of my discovery. 
I could use it for separating U-235 
from U-238 just as easily. In fact, 
I already—” He stopped in mid- 
sentence, cocked his head, looked 
at me and backtracked. “Never 
mind that. But you know what a 
Maxwell demon is?” 

“No.” 

“Good for you, Virgie. Good for 
you!” he applauded. “I knew I’d 
get the truth out of you if I waited 
long enough.” Another ambiguous 
remark, I thought to myself. “But 
you surely know the second law of 
thermodynamics.” 

“Surely.” 

“I thought you’d say that,” he 
said gravely. “So then you know 
that if you put an ice cube in a 
glass of warm water, for instance, 
the ice melts, the water cools, and 
you get a glass with no ice but 
with all the water lowered in tem- 
perature. Right? And it’s a one- 
way process. That is, you can’t 
start with a glass of cool water and, 
hocus-pocus, get it to separate into 
warm water and ice cube, right?” 
“Naturally,” I said, “for heav- 
en’s sake. I mean that’s silly.” 
“Very silly,” he agreed. “You 
know it yourself, eh? So watch” 



He didn’t say hocus-pocus. But 
he did adjust something on one of 
his gadgets. 

There was a faint whine and a 
gurgling, spluttering sound, like 
fat sparks climbing between spread- 
ing electrodes in a Frankenstein 
movie. 

The water began to steam 
faintly. 

But only at one end! That end 
was steam; the other was — was — 

It was ice. A thin skin formed 
rapidly, grew thicker; the other 
open end of the U-tube began to 
bubble violently. Ice at one end, 
steam at the other. 

Silly? 

But I was seeing it! 

I must say, however, that at the 
time I didn’t really know that that 
was all I saw. 

r l ' HE reason for this is that 
Pudge Detweiler came groan- 
ing down the steps to the labora- 
tory just then. 

“Ah, Greek,” he wheezed. “Ah, 
Virgie. I wanted to talk to you be- 
fore I left.” He came into the room 
and, panting, eased himself into 
a chair, a tired hippopotamus with 
a hangover. 

“What did you want to talk to 
me about?” Greco demanded. 

“You?” Pudge’s glance wan- 
dered around the room; it was a 
look of amused distaste, the look 
of a grown man observing the 
smudgy mud play of children. “Oh, 



130

not you, Greek. I wanted to talk 
to Virgie. That sales territory you 
mentioned, Virgie. I’ve been think- 
ing. I don’t know if you’re aware 
of it, but when my father passed 
away last winter, he left me— well, 
with certain responsibilities. And it 
occurred to me that you might be 
willing to let me invest some of 
the—” 

I didn’t even let him finish. I 
had him out of there so fast, we 
didn’t even have a chance to say 
good-by to Greco. And all that 
stuff about demons and hot-and- 
cold water and so on, it all went 
out of my head as though it had 
never been. Old Pudge Detweiler! 
How was I to know that his father 
had left him thirty thousand dol- 
lars in one attractive lump of 
cash! 

II 

T¥7ELL, there were business re- 
™ * verses. Due to the reverses, 
I was forced to miss the next few 
reunions. But I had a lot of time 
to think and study, in between 
times at the farm and the shop 
where we stamped out license 
plates for the state. 

When I got out, I began look- 
ing for El Greco. 

I spent six months at it, and I 
didn’t have any luck at all. El 
Greco had moved his laboratory 
and left no forwarding address. 

But I wanted to find him. I 



wanted it so badly, I could taste 
it, because I had begun to have 
some idea of what he was talk- 
ing about, and so I kept on look- 
ing. 

I never did find him, though. 
He found me. 

He came walking in on me in 
a shabby little hotel room, and I 
hardly recognized him, he looked 
so prosperous and healthy. 

“You’re looking just great, 
Greek,” I said enthusiastically, see- 
ing it was true. The years hadn’t 
added a pound or a wrinkle— just 
the reverse, in fact. 

“You’re not looking so bad your- 
self,” he said, and gazed at me 
sharply. “Especially for a man not 
long out of prison.” 

“Oh.” I cleared my throat. “You 
know about that.” 

“I heard that Pudge Detweiler 
prosecuted.” 

“I see.” I got up and began un- 
cluttering a chair. “Well,” I said, 
“it’s certainly good to — How did 
you find me?” 

“Detectives. Money buys a lot 
of help. I’ve got a lot of money.” 

“Oh.” I cleared my throat again. 

Greco looked at me, nodding 
thoughtfully to himself. There was 
one good thing; maybe he knew 
about my trouble with Pudge, but 
he also had gone out of his way to 
find me. So he wanted something 
out of me. 

He said suddenly, “Virgie, you 
were a damned fool.” 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“I was,” I admitted honestly. 
“Worse than you know. But I am 
no longer. Greek, old boy, all this 
stuff you told me about those de- 
mons got me interested. I had 
plenty of time for reading in prison. 
You won’t find me as ignorant as 
I was the last time we talked.” 
He laughed sourly. “That* s a hot 
one. Four years of college leave 
you as ignorant as the day you 
went in, but a couple years of jail 
make you an educated man.” 

“Also a reformed one.” 

He said mildly, “Not too re- 
formed, I hope.” 

“Crime doesn’t pay — except 
when it’s within the law. That’s 
the chief thing I learned.” 

“Even then it doesn’t pay,” he 
said moodily. “Except in money, 
of course. But what's the use of 
money?” 

T^HERE wasn’t anything to say 
to that. I said, probing delicate- 
ly, “I figured you were loaded. If 
you can use your demons to sepa- 
rate U-235 from U-238, you can 
use them for separating gold from 
sea water. You can use them for 
damn near anything.” 

“Damn near,” he concurred. 
“Virgie, you may be of some help 
to me. Obviously you've been 
reading up on Maxwell.” 
“Obviously.” 

It was the simple truth. I had 
got a lot of use out of the prison 
library— even to the point of learn- 



ing all there was to learn about 
Clerk Maxwell, one of the greatest 
of physicists, and his little demons. 
I had rehearsed it thoroughly for 
El Greco. 

“Suppose,” I said, “that you had 
a little compartment inside a pipe 
of flowing gas or liquid. That’s 
what Maxwell said. Suppose the 
compartment had a little door that 
allowed molecules to enter or leave. 
You station a demon— that’s what 
Maxie called them himself— at the 
door. The demon sees a hot molec- 
ule coming, he opens the door. He 
sees a cold one, he closes it. By 
and by, just like that, all the hot 
molecules are on one side of the 
door, all the cold ones — the slow 
ones, that is — on the other. Steam 
on one side, ice on the other, 
that’s what it comes down to.” 

“That was what you saw with 
your own eyes,” Theobald Greco 
reminded me. 

“I admit it,” I said. “And I ad- 
mit I didn’t understand. But I do 
now.” 

I understood plenty. Separate 
isotopes — separate elements, for 
that matter. Let your demon open 
the door to platinum, close it to 
lead. He could make you rich in 
no time. 

He had, in fact, done just that 
for Greco. 

RECO said, “Here. First in- 
stallment.” He pulled some- 
thing out of his pocket and handed

it to me. It was metallic — about 
the size of a penny slot-machine 
bar of chocolate, if you remember 
back that far. It gleamed and it 
glittered. And it was ruddy yellow 
in color. 

“What’s that?” I asked. 

“Gold,” he said. “Keep it, Virgie. 
It came out of sea water, like you 
said. Call it the down payment on 
your salary.” 

I hefted it. I bit it I said, “By 
the way, speaking of salary . 

“Whatever you like,” he said 
wearily. “A million dollars a year? 
Why not?” 

“Why not?” I echoed, a little 
dazed. 

And then I just sat there listen- 
ing, while he talked. What else was 
there to do? I won’t even say that 
I was listening, at least not with 
the very fullest of attention, be- 
cause that thought of a million dol- 
lars a year kept coming between 
me and his words. But I got the 
picture. The possibilities were end- 
less. And how well I knew it! 

Gold from the sea, sure. But 
energy— -free energy— it was there 
for the taking. From the molecules 
of the air, for instance. Refrigera- 
tors could be cooled, boilers could 
get up steam, homes could be 
heated, forges could be fired — and 
all without fuel. Planes could fly 
through the air without a drop of 
gasoline in their tanks. Anything. 

A million dollars a year . 

And it was only the beginning. 



I came to. “What?” 

He was looking at me. He re- 
peated patiently, “The police are 
looking for me.” 

I stared. “ You ?” 

“Did you hear about Grand 
Rapids?” 

I thought. “Oh — Wait. A fire. 
A big one. And that was you?” 
“Not me. My demons. Maxwell 
demons— or Greco demons, they 
should be called. He talked about 
them; I use them. When they’re 
not using me. This time, they 
burned down half the city.” 

“I remember now,” I said. The 
papers had been full of it. 

“They got loose,” he said grim- 
ly. “But that’s not the worst You’ll 
have to earn your million a year, 
Virgie.” 

“What do you mean, they got 
loose?” 

He shrugged. “Controls aren’t 
perfect. Sometimes the demons es- 
cape. I can’t help it.” 

“How do you control them in 
the first place?” 

He sighed. “It isn’t really what 
you would call controls,” he said. 
“It’s just the best I can do to keep 
them from spreading.” 

“But — you said sometimes you 
separate metals, sometimes you 
get energy. How do the demons 
know which you want them to 
do, if you say you can’t control 
them? 

“How do you make an apple 
tree understand whether you want

it to grow Baldwins or Macin- 
toshes?” 

T GAWKED at him. “Why - 
but you don’t, Greek! I mean 
it’s either one or the other!” 

“Just so with demons! You’re 
not so stupid after all, are you? 
It’s like improving the breed of 
dogs. You take a common ances- 
tral mutt, and generations later 
you can develop an Airedale, a 
dachshund or a Spitz. How? By 
selection. My demon entities grow, 
they split, the new entities adapt 
themselves to new conditions. 
There’s a process of evolution. I 
help it along, that’s all.” 

He took the little slab of gold 
from me, brooding. 

Abruptly he hurled it at the 
wall. “Gold!” he cried wildly. “But 
who wants it? I need help, Virgie! 
If gold will buy it from you, I’ll 
pay! But I’m desperate. You’d be 
desperate too, with nothing ahead 
but a sordid, demeaning death 
from young age and a—” 

I interrupted him. “What’s 
that?” 

It was a nearby raucous hoot- 
ing, loud and mournful. 

Greco stopped in mid-sentence, 
listening like a hunted creature. 
“My room,” he whispered. “All my 
equipment— on the floor above—” 

I stepped back, a little worried. 
He was a strange man, skinny and 
tall and wild-eyed. I was glad he 
was so thin; if he’d been built 



solidly in proportion to his height, 
just then he would have worried 
me, with those staring, frightened 
eyes and that crazy way of talk- 
ing. But I didn’t have time to wor- 
ry, in any case. Footsteps were 
thundering in the halls. Distant 
voices shouted to each other. 

The hoot came again. 

“The fire whistle!” Greco bayed. 
“The hotel’s on fire!” 

He leaped out of my room into 
the corridor. 

I followed. There was a smell of 
burning — not autumn leaves or 
paper; it was a chemical-burning 
smell, a leather-burning smell, a 
henyard-on-fire smell. It reeked of 
an assortment of things, gunpow- 
der and charred feathers, the chok- 
ing soot of burning oil, the crisp 
tang of a wood fire. It was, I 
thought for a second, perhaps the 
typical smell of a hotel on fire, but 
in that I was wrong. 

“Demons!” yelled Greco, and a 
bellhop, hurrying by, paused to 
look at us queerly. Greco sped for 
the stairs and up them. 

I followed. 

It was Greco’s room that was 
ablaze — he made that clear, try- 
ing to get into it. But he couldn’t. 
Black smoke billowed out of it, 
and orange flame. The night man- 
ager’s water bucket was going to 
make no headway against that. 

I retreated. But Greco plunged 
ahead, his face white and scary. 

I stopped at the head of the 



A FEAST OF DEMONS 



135 




stairs. The flames drove Greco off, 
but he tried again. They drove him 
off again, and this time for good. 

He stumbled toward me. “Out! 
It’s hopeless!” He turned, stared 
blindly at the hotel employees 
with their chain of buckets. “You! 
What do you think you’re doing? 
That’s—” He stopped, wetting his 
lips. “Thafs a gasoline fire,” he 
lied, “and there’s dynamite in my 
luggage. Clear the hotel, you hear 
me?” 

It was, as I say, a lie. But it 
got the hotel cleared out. 

And then— 

It might as well have been gaso- 
line and dynamite. There was a 
purplish flash and a muttering 
boom, and the whole roof of the 
four-story building lifted off. 

I caught his arm. 

“Let’s get out of here,” I said. 

He looked at me blindly. I’d 
swear he didn’t know me. His eyes 
were tortured. 

“Too late!” he croaked. “Too 
late! They’re free again!” 

Ill 

S O I went to work for Theobald 
Greco — in his laboratory in 
Southern California, where we re- 
placed some of the things that had 
been destroyed. 

And one morning I woke up and 
found my hair was white. 

I cried, “Greek!” 

Minnie came running in. I don’t 



believe I told you about Minnie. 
She was Greco’s idea of the per- 
fect laboratory assistant — stupid, 
old, worthless to the world and 
without visible kin. She came in 
and stared and set up a cackling 
that would wake the dead. 

“Mister Hampstead!” she chor- 
tled. “My, but ain’t you a sight!” 

“Where’s Greco?” I demanded, 
and pushed her out of my way. 

In pajamas and bathrobe, I 
stalked down the stairs and into 
the room that had once been a 
kitchen and now was Greco’s 
laboratory. 

“Look!” I yelled. “What about 
this?” 

He turned to look at me. 

After a long moment, he shook 
his head. 

“I was afraid of that,” he mum- 
bled. “You were a towhead as a 
kid, weren’t you? And now you’re 
a towhead again.” 

“But my hair, Greek! It’s turned 
white.” 

“Not white,” he corrected des- 
pondently. “Yellow. It’s reverted 
to youth— overnight, the way it 
happens sometimes. I warned you, 
Virgie. I told you there were dan- 
gers. Now you know. Because—” 

He hesitated, looked at me, then 
looked away. 

“Because,” he said, “you’re get- 
ting younger, just like me. If we 
don’t get this thing straightened 
out, you’re going to die of young 
age yourself.”

I stared at him. “You said that 
before, about yourself. I thought 
you’d just tongue-twisted. But you 
really mean—” 

“Sit down,” he ordered. “Virgie, 
I told you that you were looking 
younger. It wasn’t just looks. It’s 
the demons— and not just you and 
me, but a lot of people. First Grand 
Rapids. Then when the hotel 
burned. Plenty have been exposed 
—you more than most, I guess, 
ever since the day you walked 
into my lab and I was trying to re- 
capture some that had got away. 
Well, I don’t guess I recaptured 
them all.” 

“You mean I—” 

He nodded. “Some of the de- 
mons make people younger. And 
you’ve got a colony of them in 
you.” 

T SWALLOWED and sat down. 

“You mean I’m going to get 
younger and younger, until finally 
I become a baby? And then — ' 
what then, Greek?” 

He shrugged. “How do I know? 
Ask me in another ten years. Look 
at me, Virgie!” he cried, suddenly 
loud. “How old do I look to you? 
Eighteen? Twenty?” 

It was the plain truth. He looked 
no more than that. Seeing him day 
by day, I wasn’t conscious of 
change; remembering him from 
when we had gone to school, I 
thought of him as younger any- 
way. But he was forty, at the very 



least, and he didn’t look old enough 
to vote. 

He said, “I’ve had demons in- 
side of me for six years. It seems 
they’re a bit choosy about where 
they’ll live. They don’t inhabit 
the whole body, just parts of it— 
heart, lungs, liver. Maybe bones. 
Maybe some of the glands — per- 
haps that’s why I feel so chipper 
physically. But not my brain, or 
not yet. Fortunately.” 

“Fortunately? But that’s wrong, 
Greek! If your brain grew younger 
too—” 

“Fool! If I had a young brain, 
I’d forget everything I learned, 
like unrolling a tape backwards! 
That’s the danger, Virgie, the im- 
mediate danger that’s pressing me 
—that’s why I needed help! Be- 
cause if I ever forget, that’s the 
end. Not just for me — for every- 
body; because there’s no one else 
in the world who knows how to 
control these things at all. Except 
me — and you, if I can train you.” 

“They’re loose?” I felt my hair 
wonderingly. Still, it was not ex- 
actly a surprise. “How many?” 

He shrugged. “I have no idea. 
When they let the first batch of 
rabbits loose in Australia, did they 
have any idea how many there 
would be a couple of dozen genera- 
tions later?” 

I whistled. Minnie popped her 
head in the door and giggled. I 
waved her away. 

“She could use some of your

demons,” I remarked. “Sometimes 
I think she has awfully young 
ideas, for a woman who’s sixty if 
she’s a day.” 

Greco laughed crazily. “Minnie? 
She’s been working for me for a 
year. And she was eighty-five when 
I hired her!” 

“I can’t believe you!” 

“Then you’ll have to start prac- 
ticing right now,” he said. 

It was tough, and no fooling; 
but I became convinced. It wasn’t 
the million dollars a year any 
more. 

It was the thought of end- 
ing my days as a drooling, mew- 
ling infant— or worse! To avert 
that, I was willing to work my 
brain to a shred. 

THIRST it was a matter of learn- 
ing — learning about the 
“strange particles.” Ever hear of 
them? That’s not my term— that’s 
what the physicists call them. Po- 
sitrons. The neutrino. Pions and 
muons, plus and minus; the lamb- 
da and the antilambda. K par- 
ticles, positive and negative, and 
anti-protons and anti-neutrons and 
sigmas, positive, negative and neu- 
tral, and — 

Well, that’s enough; but physics 
had come a long way since the 
classes I cut at Old Ugly, and 
there was a lot to catch up on. 

The thing was, some of the 
“strange particles” were stranger 
than even most physicists knew. 



Some — in combination — were in 
fact Greco’s demons. 

We bought animals — mice, rab- 
bits, guinea pigs, even dogs. We in- 
fected the young with some of our 
own demons — that was simple 
enough, frighteningly simple; all 
we had to do was handle them a 
bit. And we watched what hap- 
pened. 

They died — of young age. 

Some vital organ or another re- 
gressed to embryonic condition, 
and they died — as Greco and I 
would die, if we didn’t find the 
answer. As the whole world might 
die. Was it better than reverting 
past the embryo to the simple life- 
less zygote? I couldn’t decide. It 
was dying, all the same. When 
an embryonic heart or liver is 
called on to do a job for a mature 
organism, there is only one way 
out. Death. 

And after death — the demons 
went on; the dog we fed on tne 
remains of the guinea pigs followed 
them to extinction in a matter of 
weeks. 

Minnie was an interesting case. 

She was going about her work 
with more energy every day, and 
I’ll be blasted if I didn’t catch 
her casting a lingering Marilyn 
Monroe sort of look at me when 
Greco’s back was turned. 

“Shall we fire her?” I asked El 
Greco when I told him about it. 

“What for?” 

“She’s disrupting the work!” 



138

A FEAST OF DEMONS 



“The work isn’t worth a damn 
anyhow,” he said moodily. “We’re 
not getting anywhere, Virgie. If it 
was only a matter of smooth, pre- 
dictable rates — But look at her. 
She’s picking up speed! She’s 
dropped five years in the past 
couple weeks.” 

“She can stand to drop a lot 
more,” I said, annoyed. 

TIE shrugged. “It depends on 
where. Her nose? It’s shor- 
tened to about a fifteen-year-old 
level now. Facial hair? That’s 
mostly gone. Skin texture? Well, 
I suppose there’s no such thing as 
a too-immature skin, I mean short 
of the embryonic capsule, but — 
Wait a minute.” 

He was staring at the doorway. 

Minnie was standing there, sim- 
pering. 

“Come here!” he ordered in a 
voice like thunder. “Come here, 
you! Virgie, look at her nose!” 

I looked. “Ugh,” I said, but more 
or less under my breath. 

“No, no!” cried Greco. “Virgie, 
don’t you see her nose?” Foolish; 
of course I did. It was long, 
beaked — 

Then I saw. 

“It’s growing longer,” I whis- 
pered. 

“Right, my boy! Right! One 
curve at least has reversed itself. 
Do you see, Virgie?” 

I nodded. “She’s — she’s be- 
ginning to age again.” 



“Better than that!” he crowed. 
“It’s faster than normal aging, Vir- 
gie! There are aging demons loose 
too!” 

A breath of hope! 

But hope died. Sure, he was 
right — as far as it went. 

There were aging demons. We 
isolated them in some of our ex- 
perimental animals. First we had 
to lure Minnie into standing still 
while Greco, swearing horribly, 
took a tissue sample; she didn’t 
like that, but a hundred-dollar 
bonus converted her. Solid C0 2 
froze the skin; snip, and a tiny 
flake of flesh came out of her nose 
at the point of Greco’s scalpel; 
he put the sample of flesh through 
a few tricks and, at the end of 
the dav, we tried it on some of 
our mice. 

They died. 

Well, it was gratifying, in a way 
— they died of old age. But die 
they did. It took three days to 
show an effect, but when it came, 
it was dramatic. These were young 
adult mice, in the full flush of 
their mousehood, but when these 
new demons got to work on them, 
they suddenly developed a frowsy, 
decrepit appearance that made 
them look like Bowery bums over 
whom Cinderella’s good fairy had 
waved her wand in reverse. And 
two days later they were dead. 

“I think we’ve got something,” 
said Greco thoughtfully; but I 
didn’t think so, and I was right 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Dead was dead. We could kill the 
animals by making them too 
young. We could kill the animals 
by making them too old. But keep 
them alive, once the demons were 
in them, we could not. 

Greco evolved a plan: Mix the 
two breeds of demons! Take an 
animal with the young-age demons 
already in it, then add a batch that 
worked in the other direction! 

"C^OR a while, it seemed to work 
—but only for a while. After a 
couple of weeks, one breed or the 
other would gain the upper hand. 
And the animals died. 

It was fast in mice, slow in hu- 
mans. Minnie stayed alive. But the 
nose grew longer and facial hair re- 
appeared; simultaneously her com- 
plexion cleared, her posture 
straightened. 

And then, for the first time, we 
oegan to read the papers. 

STRANGE PLAGUE 
STRIKES ELGIN 

bawled the Chicago Tribune, and 
went on to tell how the suburbs 
around Elgin, Illinois, were heavily 
infested with a curious new malady, 
the symptoms of which were — 
youth. 

OAKLAND “BABY-SKIN” 
TOLL PASSES 10,000 

blared the San Francisco Exam- 



iner. The New York News found 
thousands of cases in Brooklyn. A 
whole hospital in Dallas was 
evacuated to make room for vic- 
tims of the new plague. 

And more. 

We looked at each other. 
“They’re out in force,” said 
Theobald Greco soberly. “And we 
don’t have the cure.” 

IV 

T HE world was topsy-turvy, and 
in the middle of it Minnie dis- 
appeared, talking hysterically about 
reporting us to the authorities. I 
don’t mind admitting that I was 
worried. 

And the experiments were not 
progressing. The trouble seemed 
to be that the two varieties of 
demons — the aging and the youth- 
ing — were not compatible; if one 
took up residence in a given sec- 
tion of an organism, the other 
moved out. The more numerous 
destroyed the weaker; there was 
no balance. We tested it again 
and again in the mice and there 
was no doubt of it. 

So far, only the youthing de- 
mons were free. But when Minnie 
left us, it was only a matter of 
time. Our carriers — from Grand 
Rapids and from the hotel — had 
spread to California and the East 
Coast, to the North and to the 
South, throughout the country, per- 
haps by now through the world. 



A FEAST OF DEMONS

It would be slower with the aging 
demons— there was only one of 
Minnie — but it would be equally 
sure. 

Greco began drinking heavily. 

“It’s the end,” he brooded. 
“We’re licked.” 

“No, Greek! We can’t give up!” 

“We have to give up. The de- 
mons are loose in the Earth, Vir- 
gie! Those people in the headlines 
— they’ll die of young age. So will 
others — even plants and animals, 
and bacteria, as the demons adapt 
to them. And then — why not? The 
air. The rocks, the ocean, even the 
Earth itself. Remember, the en- 
tropy of the Universe is supposed 
to tend to a maximum not only as 
a whole, but in each of its parts 
taken in isolation. The Earth’s 
evolution — reversed. Spottily, and 
maybe that’s worse, because some 
parts will evolve forward and 
others reverse, as is happening in 
my own body. Heaven help the 
world, Old Virgie! And not just 
the Earth, because what can stop 
them from spreading? To the 
Moon, the other planets— out of 
the Solar System, for that matter; 
to the other galaxies, even. Why 
not? And then—” 

“GRECO.” 

An enormous tinny voice, more 
than human, filled the air. It came 
from outside. 

I jumped a foot It sounded like 
the voice of a demon; then I got 
a grip on myself and understood. 



It was a loudspeaker, and it came 
from outside. 

“GRECO. WE KNOW 
YOU’RE IN THERE. COME 
ON OUT!” 

I had a stabbing sensation of 
familiarity. “The police!” I cried. 
“Greco, it’s the police!” 

He looked at me wearily and 
shook his head. 

“No. More likely the F.BJ.” 

W ELL, that was it I got out— 
I didn’t wait for permission 
from the Greek. 

I stopped at the door, and three 
searchlight beams hit me right in 
the eye. There were cars all around 
the laboratory, but I couldn’t see 
them, not after those lights went 
on. 

I froze, stiff; wanting to make 
sure they understood (a) that I 
wasn’t Greco and (b) that I didn’t 
have a gun. 

They understood, all right 
But they let me out. 

They put me in one of the cars, 
with a slim gray-eyed young man 
in a snap-brimmed hat sitting po- 
litely and alertly beside me, and 
they let me watch; and what hap- 
pened after that wasn’t funny at 
all. 

Greco didn’t come out They 
shouted at him over the loud- 
speaker and eventually he an- 
swered— his voice little and calm, 
coming out of nowhere, and all he 
said was, “Go away. I won’t come 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




out. I warn you, don’t try to force 
your way in.” 

But he knew they wouldn’t lis-. 
ten, of course. 

They didn’t. 

They tried force. 

And he met it in novel ways 
with force of his own. The door 
had locked itself behind me; they 
got a fence post for a battering 
ram, and the post burst into flame. 
They found an L-beam from an 
old bed frame and tried that, and 
they were sorry they had done it; 
the thing melted in the middle, 
splattering them with hot drops of 
steel. 

The polite, alert young man be- 
side me said, not so polite any 
more, “What’s he doing, you? What 
sort of fancy tricks has he got in 
there?” 

“Demons,” I said crazily, and 
that was a mistake, but what else 
was I to do? Try to explain Max- 
well’s equations to a Fed? 

They were trying again— there 
were fifteen or twenty of them, at 
least. They went for the windows, 
and the windows dissolved and 
rained cherry-red wet glass on 
them. They tried again through 
the open frames when the glass 
was gone, and the frames burst 
into fire around them, the blue 
smoke bleached white in the yel- 
low of the flame and the white of 
the searchlights. They tried singly, 
by stealth; and they tried in clus- 
ters of a dozen, yelling. 



IT was hopeless — hopeless for 

everybody, because they couldn’t 
get in and the Greek could never, 
never get out; for go away they 
wouldn’t. Not even when, with 
poof and a yellow flare, the gas 
tank of one of the cars exploded. 
All that happened was that the 
man in the snap-brimmed hat and 
I leaped out, real quick; and then 
all the cars went up. But the men 
didn’t leave. And then the guns 
began to go off without waiting for 
anyone to pull the trigger; and the 
barrels softened and slumped and 
spattered to the ground. But the 
men still had bare hands, and they 
stayed. 

The Greek got wild — or lost 
control, it was hard to tell which. 
There was a sudden catastrophic 
whooshing roar and, wham, a tree 
took flame for roots. A giant old 
oak, fifty feet tall, I guess it had 
been there a couple of centuries, 
but Greco’s demons changed all 
that; it took flame and shot whis- 
tling into the air, spouting flame 
and spark like a Roman candle. 
Maybe he thought it would scare 
them. Maybe it did. But it also 
made them mad. And they ran, all 
at once, every one of them but my 
personal friend, for the biggest, 
openest of the windows — 

And leaped back, cursing and 
yelling, beating out flames on their 
clothes. 

Jets of flame leaped out of 
every window and door. The old 



A FEAST OF DEMONS

building seemed to bulge outward 
and go voom. In half a second, it 
was a single leaping tulip of fire. 

The firemen got there then, but 
it was a little late. Oh, they got 
Greco out — alive, even. But they 
didn’t save a bit of the laboratory. 
It was the third fire in Greco’s 
career, and the most dangerous — 
for where previously only a few of 
the youthing demons had escaped, 
now there were vast quantities of 
both sorts. 

It was the end of the world. 

I knew it. 

VTOU know, I wish I had been 
right. I spent yesterday with 
Greco. He’s married now and has 
a fine young son. They made an 
attractive family picture, the two 
healthy-looking adults, strong-fea- 
tured, in the prime of life, and the 
wee toddler between them. 

The only thing is — Greco’s the 
toddler. 

He doesn’t call himself Greco 
any more. Would you, the way the 
world is now? He has plenty of 
money stashed away — I do too, of 
course — not that money means 
very much these days. His brain 
hasn’t been affected, just his body. 
He was lucky, I guess. Some of the 
demons hit the brain in some of 
their victims and — 

Well, it’s pretty bad. 

Greco got the answer after a 
while. Both types of demons were 
loose in the world, and both, by 



and by, were in every individual. 

But they didn’t kill each other 
off. 

One simply grew more rapidly, 
took over control, until it ran out 
of the kind of molecules it needed. 
Then the other took over. 

Then the first. 

Then the other again . 

Mice are short-lived. It’s like 
balancing a needle on the end of 
your nose; there isn’t enough space 
in a mouse’s short span for balance, 
any more than there is in a 
needle’s. 

But in a human life — 

Things are going to have to be 
worked out, though. 

It’s bad enough that a family 
gets all mixed up the way Greco’s 
is — he’s on a descending curve, his 
kid is on an aging curve, and Min- 
nie— did I tell you that it was 
Minnie he married? — has com- 
pleted her second rejuvenation and 
is on the way back up again. 

But there are worse problems 
that that. 

For one thing, it isn’t going to be 
too long before we run out of 
space. I don’t mean time, I mean 
space. Living space. 

Because it’s all very well that 
the human animal should now 
mature to grow alternately younger 
and older, over and over — 

But, damn it, how I wish that 
somebody once in a while would 
die!
