IF ♦ Editorial 


Enemies of Mankind 


O ne of the things we like about 
Robert Heinlein’s The Moon 
Is a Harsh Mistress is that Hein- 
lein isn’t scared by machines. So 
many writers are! We keep getting 
stories about the terrible world of 
the future in which machines do all 
the work and people turn into lotos- 
eaters and drones. We keep reject- 
ing them, too; but every week 
there’s a new crop with the same 
dreary idea. 

The fact is, of course, machines 
work /or men. They aren’t our ene- 
mies; they are our slaves. It is per- 
fectly clear to anyone who cares 
to look that the more work that 
gets done, the more real wealth 
there is to share; and the more 
machines we build and put to work 
for us, the more work will get 
done. 

Of course, there are problems — 
and the biggest of all is arranging 
for the distribution of the wealth. 
We naturally feel that there is 
bound to be a catch in any system 
which allots a certain proportion of 
the Gross Terrestrial Product to 
each living person, and so no coun- 
try in the world (including the so- 
cialist countries — maybe especial- 
ly the socialist countries) just 
chops up its income at so much 
per head and passes it out every 
Friday. Nevertheless, the richer a 
country is, the richer its average 
citizen is. And machines are busy 
making all of our countries richer 
as fast as we let them. 

As fast as we let them? Does that 


mean we are keeping the machines 
from making us rich? 

Yes, indeed. As long as there 
are strikes against automation, we 
are preventing the machines from 
doing what they can do very welfc 
There have been scores of strikes 
against automation each year. All 
too often they have been successful. 

But in at least one case a union 
leadership has decided not to try to 
lick the machines, but to join them. 
The West Coast longshoremen 
don’t fight automation. They wel- 
come it, because they have arranged 
to share in the savings from the 
us- of machines to do stevedoring 
work. Every dollar of savings is 
divided between the companies' hir- 
ing the longshoremen and the union 
pension fund. 

Good idea! Now, if only we could 
work out the same system for other 
industries. 

A nd of course we can; it just 
takes a little thought, is all. 
Which reminds us of a good line 
we heard the other night, at a din- 
ner party involving a mixed bag 
of scientists and science-fictioneers. 
Someone said something to John 
Pierce about machines that think 
like people. “That’s old stuff,” said 
Pierce. “We’re now working on 
machines that act the way people 
do — without thinking.” 

Of course, that’s just a joke. 
People don’t really act without 
thinking. 

Do they? — The Editor.

IF • Short Sto#$ 



by DON F. BRIGGS 


Cindy-Me aren't human , exactly. 
But we have some human traitsl 


C indy-Me sensed the Watcher high 
up over Oceanside long before 
we saw him, flickering lights in a 
moonbright sky anybody else would 
have thought were stars or blinkers 
on a plane or something. 

Cindy-Me knew better. We veer- 
ed off so sharp I almost lost my hold 
around Cindy’s waist, zooming 
down over the whitecaps close 
enough to feel the seaspray on our 
legs. Cindy’s long hair, heavy with 
sweat, whipped back in my face. It 
kept getting in my eyes and mouth 
and tickling my nose like mad, and 
me not able to scratch or sneeze or 
nothing but just hang on. 

Cindy gave me a sharp elbow in 
the ribs, as if I needed any goosing. 
We thought speedthoughts together 
hard as we could. The old tree limb 
surged under us like it didn’t want 
to meet up with Old Ralph, neither. 


Dark, greasy-looking swells rolled 
back beneath, white-tipped and 
smelling of summer and sea things 
which flared our nostrils and made 
us want to gulp our lungs full and 
howl at the stars. 

“Couldn’t have been him or we’d 
be dead,” Cindy-Me thought togeth- 
er. Half hour was about all the time 
we had. That’s how long it would 
take for Old Ralph to get wired-in 
and come a-helling after us. We’d 
have to find a place to hole in fast 
or we’d be smelling ozone soon 
enough and we wouldn’t have to 
look over our shoulders to tell who 
it was. Then it would be a quick 
hello and bingo . wipe out. 

“Old Ralph is a mean old crut!” 
Cindy thought. I let her know her 
shield had slipped by laughing ob- 
scenely right out close behind her 
ear. Suddenly we were both laugh- 


34 


mg. He hadn't caught us yet, had 
he? The tenseness was gone far 
behind with those dancing lights. 
Even Old Ralph seemed less power- 
ful somehow, out here with the 
night and the cool wind and the 
ocean, when you thought of him, 
that way . instead of what he 
really was. 

Some kid at school told me one. 
time that San Diego would be a 
real pretty city if they took the 
sailors out. But if they did that, it 
wouldn’t be a city at all. I told him 
he was full of you-know-what, not 
because I knew anything about it, 
but because he was trying to show 
off in front of my girl. I hate those 
philosophical kooks who try to steal 
your girl with stuff like that. A real 
winner, that one! Anyway, it didn’t 
work, because she and I both knew 
what she liked best. 

I’ll tell you one thing, San Diego 
sure looked pretty to Cindy-Me 
when we came sliding down into 
that big zoo they’re so proud of. 
They’ve got these dens and stuff 
with moats around them and trees 
all up and down those hills. Just the 
place for Cindy-Me. We found us 
some big brown bears to snuggle 
up with. They didn’t mind too much 
after we got inside their heads and 
convinced them we were cubs. Real 
smelly, but a hell of a lot better 
than Old Ralph, especially after I 
finally persuaded this big mother 
bear that I didn’t need a bath. Any- 
way it was warm enough. San Diego 
can get pretty chilly just before 
dawn, even in summer, being right 
on the ocean, particularly when 
you’re trying to sleep on rocks. 


People started coming in the next 
morning, attendants first, taking 
care of the animals and getting 
everything spruced up so as the 
tourists could come in and litter it 
all up again. Soon there were a lot 
of people, laughing and gawking 
and picture-taking, or just standing 
around acting bored and kind of 
superior. We slipped in among them 
and got lost. Who notices a couple 
more teenagers at a place like that? 
There are too many other animals 
to look at. 

Cindy-Me opened our mind and 
tried to absorb as much of the 
thoughts of the. creeps around us 
as we could stand. Phew! You can’t 
imagine how dirty people’s minds 
get sometimes, especially when they 
get around other people. It’s even 
worse when they start smelling the 
animals. Cindy-Me got used to it 
long before we got to be sixteen, 
which we were then ... or almost 
sixteen. We kept our own mind teal 
blank so’s any Watcher who scanned 
the place would have a heck of a 
time sorting. 

I n a way it was fun. We ate pea- 
nuts and ice cream and hot dogs 
and a lot of junk like that, stuff Old 
Ralph won’t let us have at home. 
Cindy picked up a bunch of dumb 
college boys that followed her 
around like hungry coon hounds, 
just trying to get her to smile at 
them or say something. Cindy’s a 
big girl for her age and kind of 
beautiful. I can see that, even if she 
is my twin sister. But don’t call me 
handsome or anything like that un- 
less you want a fat lip. 


CINDY-ME 


35 



We just wandered around for an 
boor or so, staring at the animals 
«ad killing time. Most of the ani- 
mals thought we were funny as hell, 
especially one old baboon who got 
the idea that Cindy in her red capris 
looked from the rear a whole lot 
like somebody he’d once met in the 
jungle. 

I kept glancing at my watch and 
stopping every few minutes to make 
sure I hadn’t lost our bus tickets. 
It’s funny how everybody always 
thinks he’s going to lose something 
he needs real bad. The guys with 
Cindy kept looking at me like I 
was some kind of kook and hoping 
Fd get lost. It didn’t bother me. 
Aunt Ag’s letter had been pretty 
firm about the 1:30 bus from San 
Diego to Fort Worth. Next to Old 
Ralph, I wouldn’t want to cross 
Aunt Ag the best. 

You might wonder why we didn’t 
take a plane or fly all the way our- 
selves, like we got to San Diego. 
Planes fly too high and they’re all 
closed in so’s you can’t get out. 
Even if we could, Cindy-Me got to 
breathe like anybody else. As for 
the other, if you must know, flying 
a tree limb is too rough on the 
crotch for long distances. Trains are 
too hard to get off if a Watcher 
should spot us. Driving a car would 
have been fun, except we didn’t 
know how. Besides we’d have been 
spotted sure. Cindy-Me have to keep 
enough minds around us to get lost 
in or we’d stand out to a Watcher 
like a space beacon to a Ship-of-the- 
Line. We’d never have taken a 
chance and flown that damn limb 
all the way to San Diego except we 


didtft have time to do anything else 

The evening before, during sup- 
per, Old Ralph’s nitwit secretary let 
her guard down for an instant. 
Right away we knew that Old Ralph 
had found out Aunt Ag was back 
on Earth. He was heading back 
from Red China right then like an 
ICBM. 

Lucky for us he’s pretty busy 
over there these days. If he’d been 
home in L.A. with us when the 
word came about Aunt Ag, Cindy- 
Me would have woken up dead. 
We’d planned to leave the next 
morning anyway; only now there 
wasn’t any time to goof around. We 
struggled through supper, stringing 
the old broad along all the way, 
then we grabbed the nearest palm 
frond and took off. My aching butt! 

One of the boys who had been 
giving Cindy the rush, a big skinny 
guy with long, bleached hair and 
pimples, was beginning to get some 
very personal thoughts about Cindy 
mixed up with his observations of 
the things going on in the back cor- 
ner of the monkey cage they were 
standing in front of. I concentrated 
on him and itched him good. 

When Cindy-Me slipped away a 
few minutes later he was rolling 
around on the ground scratching like 
he thought his skin was leather. The 
rest of the college bums and a lot 
of other nosy people were clustered 
around watching from a safe dis- 
tance, too curious to leave but scar- 
ed that whatever it was might get 
on them. I itched a few adults as 
we left so’s they would think it was 
a frat initiation or something and 
maybe lose interest.

IF 



C indy-Me grabbed a city bus 
downtown and got on the big 
one about the time it was getting 
ready to pull out. The bus was 
pretty crowded when we climbed on, 
but we soon took care of that. We 
needed people around us all right, 
but this was ridiculous. Those pas- 
sengers were jammed into the dou- 
ble seats on each side of the aisle 
as close as two pieces of salami in 
the middle of a package. Right away 
we could see that we wouldn’t get to 
sit together, and already the place 
was beginning to smell a little like 
that bears’ den back at the zoo. 

Cindy-Me got the old lower intes- 
tine routine going. Before the bus 
could get rolling about half the peo- 
ple decided that the tiny john in 
the back of the bus wasn’t going to 
get the job done for them, especial- 
ly if they had to wait in line. They 
kept rolling their eyes and holding 
their bellys, trying to make up their 
minds. We gave them both barrels. 
Finally our victims all got off, mak- 
ing it look real casual as they gath- 
ered their small suitcases and parcels 
together and made it down the ais- 
le, most of them half doubled over. 

We watched them through the big 
window beside the seat we had pick- 
ed out after the exodus. The bus 
driver gave those people a real rough 
time for making him unload the 
luggage to get theirs back. As fast 
as one of them caught sight of his 
bag he would grab it and run like 
hell for the depot. We gave each 
one a parting shot or two just to 
keep them honest. To tell the truth, 
I’m not sure they all made it in 
time. 


The driver finally got all the right 
luggage reloaded and came up on 
the bus, mumbling. You should have 
heard his mind! We pulled out of 
the depot ten minutes late, but that 
bus driver was so mad he drove like 
he was trying out for Indianapolis, 
and before we knew it we were 
right back on schedule. 

By the time we got to El Centro, 
Cindy-Me began to relax a little. 
We took turns napping. A bus seat 
is supposed to be comfortable now- 
adays and just right for sleeping — 
at least that’s what their advertising 
folders say. You know where you 
can put THEM. One thing though, 
it beats curling up with a bearskin, 
especially when the bear is still in 
it. 

The bus stops were the worst, not 
just because they were crumby little 
joints mostly, which they were Cin- 
dy-Me had bought plenty of junk to 
eat so’s we didn’t have to get off. 
But the next character that got on 
at one of those stops might be a 
Watcher. Cindy-Me had a bus sche- 
dule, and we finally figured out 
how the stupid thing worked; so we 
were ready each time the bus started 
in to slow down. 

One thing we hadn’t figured on 
was the air conditioning. The bus 
was like the inside of a freezer, es- 
pecially next to the windows where 
the vents were, and Cindy-Me had 
come away too fast to get our sweat- 
ers or nothing like that. We got busy 
and jimmied the unit by mindshift- 
ing a few small wires and parts, not 
permanent though. We could put 
them back if we had to. Good thing 
we did it that way, too, because 


CINDY-ME 


37 



p>Liy soon it began to warm up in- 
side. When it got to be too much, 
we had to turn the thing back on. 
It was a drag turning it on and off, 
but the only other choice was to 
end up either frosted or french-fried. 

r I ''hat bus took the craziest route 
you ever saw. Living in a place 
like L.A. you forget that there’s so 
much nothing in the same part of 
the world. You never saw such a 
lot of desert in your whole life un- 
less you’re some kind of nut that 
likes that kind of stuff. In a way, 
though, it was kind of pretty — if 
you go in for rocks and cactus. 
Some parts of it would have made a 
hell of a good beach if there’d been 
some place to surf. But then I guess 
you don’t find too many oceans in 
the middle of a desert. 

Between naps, Cindy-Me sorted 
the people on the bus to find out 
what kind of characters we’d have 
to deal with in an emergency. 
Strangely, there were a few half-way 
decent people still aboard, though 
Cindy-Me had tried to get rid of 
most of that kind back at the depot 
because we knew what would hap- 
pen to them if Old Ralph cAught 
up with us. As for the rest, Cindy- 
Me spent a couple of entertaining 
hours figuring out what we would 
do to them ourselves when we got 
around to it. 

Cindy in particular had some 
very nasty ideas about this young 
guy with an old-looking wife and a 
couple of runny-nosed kids. He had 
it all figured out how he would slip 
away over the border into Juarez 
when they got to El Paso and take 


off for parts unknown. Personally, 
after I got a good look at the kids, 
I thought it was a damn good plan, 
but Cindy thought differently. That’s 
a broad for you. They all stick 
together. 

One thing 1 found out. After a 
while 1 didn t mind riding on a bus. 
It was a beautiful night. The big 
bus rolied along like it owned 
the highway. The sky was bright 
with a big moon and more stars 
visible than you ever get to see in 
the city. Every once in a while a 
car would come up on us over a hill 
and light up the interior of the bus. 
By that time most of the characters 
were asleep except for one old broad 
a few rows back mat had been giv- 
ing me the eye ever since I got on 
the bus. Every once in a while I 
would turn around and smile at her 
just to keep her motor running. She 
must have been at least twenty-four, 
but with the thoughts that kept run- 
ning through Cindy’s mind I was 
beginning to warm up myself, and 
that broad was beginning to turn me 
on. 

Right after we left Tucson, Cindy 
closed her eyes and began going to 
work on that young husband. It kind 
of made me sick the things she did 
to him long range without his even 
knowing it. She fixed him up for 
one thing so’s he ain’t going to have 
any more kids, and it won’t be a bit 
of fun trying either. 

While Cindy was busy with her 
good-deed-doing, I got up and sat 
down next to my new friend. She 
was all ready for me and covered us 
both up with a blanket. It wasn’t 
too bad either, though it kept me 


38 


IT 



pretty busy keeping the minds of 
those people who were still awake 
concentrated elsewhere. Once some 
nut in a car came up real fast be- 
hind the bus blinking his headlights 
like mad and trying to pass. I 
reached back and switched off his 
lights for him. I could hear his 
brakes screeching all the way 
through the walls of the bus. We 
didn’t see him again after that so 
I don’t know whether he made it 
or not. 

They held the bus an extra fif- 
teen minutes at El Paso waiting for 
the young guy to come back, which 
he never did. Finally the wife and 
kids got off, too. I felt awfully 
sorry few them, but not nearly as 
sorry as I did for that poor kook. 
Boy, was he in for a surprise! 

We got quite a jolt ourselves soon 
after we got out of El Paso. Cindy- 
Me had been too busy arguing over 
how we’d both spent the night to 
notice the new passengers. 

By the time we did, it was almost 
too late. 

nphey must have been trained 
A especially for this. Their shields 
were nearly perfect. One of the 
Watchers looked like a sloppy old 
woman; the other appeared to be a 
middle-aged Negro man. Apparently 
they had taken positions at both 
ends of the bus, the man toward the 
front and the old woman bade by 
die john. 

They left their seats at the same 
time and were almost on ns before 
we knew it. 

Cindy-Me grabbed lor one an- 
other’s hands instinctively and frost 


the Watchers in their tracks. They 
stood there silently, glaring down at 
us, hatred pouring from their eyes. 
Man, those minds were blazing! 
They had us, and they knew it. 
The man had just the trace of a 
smile on his lips. I was sweating 
like I was in a sauna, Cindy-Me felt 
them forcing open our grip on their 
minds, like some big guy unwrap- 
ping your fingers from around an 
orange. 

We knew right then that it was 
just a question of time. Despite our 
unique advantage, we could not pos- 
sibly hold out much longer against 
two adult Watchers. We could see 
they were getting real cocky, and 
Cindy-Me knew suddenly that we 
might still have a slim chance to 
live. 

We hit them right then with 
everything we had, probing deep, 
watching for a sign of weakness. It 
came at last. Just for an instant the 
old woman seemed to sway back- 
ward AWAY from us. 

I wrenched my mind free of rap- 
port with Cindy for the microsecond 
needed to reach out and squeeze the 
heart of the bus driver. Cindy was 
screaming silently inside my head as 
I returned to her. The male Watch- 
er now stood a step closer to us 
and was reaching toward Cindy. He 
Hi ought he was in. Then the bus hit 
the shoulder and lurched. 

The male Watcher was thrown off 
balance. He reached out instinctively 
to steady himself and his attention 
wavered, just long enough. Cindy- 
Me stood up. Ignoring the woman, 
we poured our combined strength 
into hfe brain. It was like snuffing 




CINDY-ME 



oat a candle with a buHet at a shoot- 
ing gallery. As he crumpled we 
wheeled together to face the old 
woman. We were almost in time to 
prevent the shrill distress signal 
which she poured out from her 
mind, more than enough to have 
been sensed half way across the con- 
tinent. 

We cooked her brain well done, 
of course, but it was already too 
late. Old Ralph would hear and 
would come. 

Cindy-Me turned quickly toward 
Ae front of the bus. Although the 
duel had lasted only a few seconds 
the bus had already left the pave- 
ment and was hurtling down the side 
of a ravine. The mouths of passen- 
gers were beginning to open as they 
became aware of their danger and 
prepared to scream out their last 
instants on Earth. Cindy-Me leaned 
forward, clutching at the seat. We 
thought speedthoughts desperately. 
Almost too late the Mg bus re- 
sponded. It left the ground, barely 
clearing the top- of a huge boulder 
Then we were m the clear and rising 
into the bright summer sky. 

How does all that grab yew? Any- 
way, that’s the way it happened. 

We figured Old Ralph could read 
a bus schedule, too; so we cut out 
On a new course. We didn’t stop to 
think that he could also read a radar 
screen. 

That was how he was able to 
find us and force the bus down just 
outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico. 

e idy-Me had gotten rid of the 
other passengers at the first 

town we flew over after the acci- 


dent. They marched out die front 
door like good little soldiers except 
they were screaming and they kept 
right on screaming until they hit the 
ground. 

I’d like to tell you that we lower- 
ed them down Kke Alice tumbling 
down the rabbit hole, as gently as 
falling feathers, just in case you 
think we’re fiends or something. 
But I can’t. Normally we would 
have, in spite of the kind of people 
they were, mostly, but we just didn’t 
have the time. We had our own 
skins to think of, didn’t we? 

Old Ralph was pretty mad when 
he got on that bus. In fact even his 
froth had froth. He gave us the 
damnedest lecture you ever heard, 
all about morality and noblesse 
oblige and all that crap and why he 
didn’t want to have to kill his own 
nephew and niece but he was going 
to have to do it to keep the world 
safe for all these Earth-type kooks, 
cha, cha, cha. 

I finally interrupted long enough 
to tell him that if he was going to 
kill us he ought to go ahead and 
do it and not bore us to death. And 
so he tried. The bastard tried real 
hard . and that was when Aunt 
Ag, who was helping us, stepped out 
of the little john at the back of the 
bus. 

You sec, Aunt Ag can read a 
distress signal, too, and she also 
knows how to use radar. And for 
that matter, she’s a hell of a lot 
faster on a broom or such. She gets 
a lot more practice. 

You should have heard them go 
at it. Uncle Ralph said he was sorry 
hett ever married her, and Aunt Ag 


IP 



said she wasn’t sorry she’d married 
him because it gave her the right 
to make his life miserable. And 
Uncle Ralph asked why she’d come 
back. Things were going pretty good 
here on Earth right now he said, 
with only a few dozen little wars 
going on and a lot of massacres and 
riots and stuff but if Cindy-Me 
would join him, he could end all 
that. 

And Aunt Ag said that was 
exactly why she’d come back. She 
thought that one BIG war would be 
a whole lot nicer, and Aunt Ag and 
Cindy-Me would be just the team 
to get it started. 

Then Uncle Ralph turned to us 
and made a speech, even longer 
than the first one but not half as 
good, about how we were the focal 
point of ten million years of devel- 
opment for the Watchers. That only 
Aunt Ag and us, besides himself, 
could link our minds. That together 
we were the greatest force for good 
... or evil ... in the universe. He 
told us that this Earth was the heri- 
tage of the human race, these poor 
struggling kooks that were trying to 
rise upward to true civilization. 
Would we destroy them, he asked, 
just to gain a small world for our 


own people who had the entire 
galaxy to live in? He told about 
Aunt Ag’s political party and hit 
own, for and against survival of the 
human race. Would we join with 
him to prevent this wipe out or with 
Aunt Ag who wished nothing but to 
destroy? Good or evil? Which would 
it be? 

Naturally we chose evil. We link- 
ed hands with Aunt Ag and for the 
first time were en rapport with her. 
Then Ag-Cindy-Me turned to face 
Old Ralph. 

He died slowly, but I must say, 
quite well. 

Now we’ve replaced Uncle Ralph 
in Red China, picking up the loose 
threads which he left and tearing out 
all the stitching. I must say he had 
made substantial progress with the 
Chinese. Some of them were almost 
nice when we got here, but we’ve 
changed all of that. 

I don’t think Unde Ralph got 
very far with their leader though. 
Maybe in time he would have. This 
is one kook I really dig. We had a 
very pleasant dinner with him only 
last night talking over his plans. He 
seems to like us. I don’t see why he 
shouldn’t. He seems to be our kind 
of people. END

Whet Has Gone Before — 


We Lunarians have put up with a lot from Earth, but time comes when 
we don't want to put up with more. Earth teUs us what we can sell, who 
we sell it to, how much we can get for it. Means slavery. 

But . Earth owns us outright. Question is, what can we do about 
ft? I don't mind a gamble — wouldn't mind fighting Earth with a chance 
to win — but with no chance, no. Luna has no warships. Earth has plenty. 
Luna has no armies. Earth has armies to burn. 

Most of all, Luna is run by big computer, and Earth owns the 
computer. 

But there's one thing Earth doesn't own — me. And it ^ust so happens 
that I'm the fellow that fixes the computer . and the computer is my good 
friend I call Mike! 

So maybe — just maybe — we Lunarians can do something at last. 


dered a liter, plus ice. It came doww; 
was tomato juice from breakfast. 

“Now,” I said, after we toasted, 
“Prof, what you think of pennant 
race? Got money says Yankees can*t 
do it again?” 

“Manuel, what is your political 
philosophy?” 

“With that new boy from Milwao. 
kee I feel like investing.” 

“Sometimes a man doesn’t have 
ft defined but, under Socratic in- 
quiry, knows where he stands and 
why.” 

“I’ll back ’em against field, three 
to two.” 

“What? You young idiot! How 

much?” 

“Three hundred. Hong Kong.” 

“Done. Few example, under what 
circumstances may the State justly 
place its welfare above that of a 
citizen?” 


“Mannie,” Wyoh asked, “do you 
have any more foolish money? I 
think well of the Phillies.” 

I looked her over. “Just what 
yon were thinking of betting'?” 
“You go to hellf Rapist.” 

“Prof, as I see, are no circum- 
stances under which State is justi- 
fied in placing its welfare ahead of 
mine.” 

“Good. We have a starting point.” 
“Mannie,” said Wyoh, “that’s a 
most self-centered evaluation.” 

“I’m a most self-centered person.” 
“Oh, nonsense. Who rescued me? 
Me, a stranger. And didn’r try to 
exploit it. Professor, I was cracking 
not facking. Mannie was a perfect 
knight.” 

“Sans peur et sans reproche. I 
knew, I’ve known him for years. 
Which is not inconsistent with eval- 
uation he expressed.”

“Oh, but it is! Not the way things 
are but undo* the ideal toward 
which we aim. Mannie, the ‘State* is 
Luna. Even though not sovereign 
yet and we hold citizenships else- 
where. But / am part of die Lunar 
State and so is your family. Would 
you die for your family?^’ 

‘Two questions not related.** 

“Oh, but they are! That’s the 
point.** 

“Nyet. I know my family, opted 
long ago.** 

“Dear Lady, I must Come to Man- 
uel’s defense. He has a correct 
evaluation even though he may not 
be able to state it May I ask this? 
Under what circumstances is it mor- 
al for a group to do that which is 
not moral for a member of that 
group to do alone?** 

“Uh . that’s a trick question.** 
“It is the key question, dear Wyo- 
ming. A radical question that strikes 
to the root of the whole dilemma of 
government Anyone who answers 
honestly and abides by ali conse- 
quences knows where he stands — 
and what he will die for.” 

W d i frowned. “ *Not moral for 
a member of the group — ’ ** 
she said. “Professor . what are 
your political principles?” 

“May I first ask yours? If you 
can state them?” 

“Certainly I can! Pm a Fifth In- 
ternationalist most of the Organi- 
zation is. Oh, we don’t rule out any- 
one going our way; it’s a united 
front. We have Communists and 
Fourths and Ruddyites and Socie- 
tians and Single-Taxers and you 
name it. But I’m no Marxist; we 


Fifths have a practical program. 
Private where private belongs, pub- 
lic where it’s needed, and an admis- 
sion that circumstances alter cases.** 
“Capital punishment?” 

“For what?” 

“Let’s say for treason. Against 
Luna after you’ve freed Luna.” 
‘Treason how? Unless I knew the 
circumstances I could not decide.** 
“Nor could L dear Wyoming. But 
I believe in capital .punishment un- 
der some circumstances . with 
this difference. I would not ask a 
court. I would try, condemn, execute 
sentence myself and accept full re- 
sponsibility.” 

“But — Professor, what are your 
political beliefs?” 

Tm a rational anarchist.” 

“I don’t know that brand. An- 
archist individualist, anarchist com- 
munist, Christian anarchist, philo- 
sophical anarchist, syndicalist, lib- 
ertarian — those I know. But what’s 
Ibis? Randtte?” 

T can get along with a Randite. 
A rational anarchist believes that 
concepts such as ‘state’ and ‘society* 
nH ’government* have no existence 
save as physically exemplified in the 
acts of self -responsible individuals. 
He believes that it is impossible to 
rfaft blame, share blame, distribute 
Marne ... as blame, guilt, responsi- 
bility are matters taking place inside 
human beings singly and nowhere 
eise. But being rational, he knows 
that not all individuals hold his 
evaluations, so he tries to live per- 
fectly in an imperfect world . 
aware that his effort will be less 
than perfect yet undismayed by self- 
knowledge of self -failure.”

“Hear, hear!” I said. ‘“Less than 
perfect.’ What I’ve been aiming for 
all my life.” 

“You’ve achieved it,” said Wyoh. 
“Professor, your words sound good 
but there is something slippery 
about them. Too much power in 
the hands of individuals. Surely 
you would not want . well, H- 
missiles for example — to be con- 
trolled by one irresponsible person?” 
“My point is that one person is 
responsible. Always. If H-bombs ex- 
ist — and they do — some man con- 
trols them. In terms of morals there 
is no such thing as a * state / Just 
men. Individuals. Each responsible 
for his own acts.” 

“Anybody need a refill?” I asked. 
Nothing uses up alcohol faster 
than political argument. I sent for 
another bottle. 

I did not take part. I was not dis- 
satisfied back when we were 
“ground under Iron Heel of Au- 
thority.” I cheated Authority and 
rest of time didn’t think about R. 
Didn’t think about getting rid of 
Authority — impossible. Go own 
way, mind own business, not be 
bothered. 

True, didn’t have luxuries then; 
by Earthside standards we were 
poor. If had to be imported, mostly 
did without. Don’t think there was 
a powered door in all Luna. 

Even p-suits used to be fetched 
up from Terra^— until a smart Chin- 
ee before I was born figured how 
to make “monkey copies” better and 
simpler. (Could dump two Chinee 
down in one of our maria and they 
would get rich selling rocks to each 


other while raising twelve kids. Then 
a Hindu would sell retail stuff he 
got from them wholesale — below 
cost at fat profit. We got along.) 

I had seen those luxuries Earth- 
side. Wasn’t worth what they put 
up with. Don’t mean heavy gravity, 
that doesn’t bother them; I mean 
nonsense. All time kukai moa. If 
chicken guano in one earthworm 
city were shipped to Luna, fertilizer 
problem would be solved for cen- 
tury. Do this. Don’t do that. Stay 
back in line. Where’s tax receipt? 
Fill out form. Let’s see license. Sub- 
mit six copies. Exit only. No left 
turn. No right turn. Queue up to 
pay fine. Take back and get 
stamped. Drop dead — but first get 
permit. 

Wyoh plowed doggedly into Prof, 
certain she had all answers. But Prof 
was interested in questions rather 
than answers, which baffled her. 
Finally she said, “Professor, I can’t 
understand you. I don’t insist that 
you call it ‘government’ — I just want 
you to state what rules you think 
are necessary to insure equal free- 
dom for all.” 

“Dear lady, 1*11 happily accept 
your rules.” 

“But you don’t seem to want any 
rules!” 

‘True. But I will accept any rules 
that you feel necessary to your 
freedom. / am free, no matter what 
rules surround me. If I find them 
tolerable, I tolerate them; if I find 
them too obnoxious, I break them. 
I am free because I know that 7 
alone am morally responsible for 
everything I do.” 

“You would not abide by a law 


46 


IF 



that the majority felt was neces- 
sary?” 

“Tell me what law, dear lady, and 
I will tell you whether I will obey.” 

“You wiggled out. Everytime I 
state a general principle, you wiggle 
out.” 

Prof clasped hands on chest. 
“Forgive me. Believe me, lovely 
Wyoming, I am most anxious to 
please you. You spoke of willingness 
to unite the front with anyone going 
your way. Is It enough that I want 
to see the Authority thrown off 
Luna . and would die to serve 
that end?” 

Wyoh beamed. “It certainly is!” 

She fisted his ribs — gently — then 
put arm around him and kissed 
cheek. “Comrade! Let’s get on with 
it!” 

“Cheers!” I said. “Let’s fin’ War- 
den ’n ’liminate him!” Seemed a 
idea; I had had a short night 
and don’t usually drink much. 

Prof topped our glasses, held his 
high and announced with great dig- 
nity: “Comrades . we declare 
the Revolution.^

T hat got us both kissed. But so- 
bered me, as Prof sat down and 
said, “The Emergency Committee of 
Free Luna is in session. We must 
plan action.” 

I said, “Wait, Prof! / didn’t agree 
to anything. What’s this ‘action’ 
stuff?” 

“We will now overthrow the Au- 
thority,” he said blandly. 

“How? Going to throw rocks at 
’em?” 


“That remains to be worked out. 
This is the planning stage.” 

I said, “Prof, you know me. If 
kicking out Authority was thing we 
could buy, I wouldn’t worry about 
price.” 

444 — our lives, our fortunes, and 
our sacred honor.*” 

“Huh?” 

“A price that once was paid.” 
“Well— I’d go that high But 
when I bet I want a chance to win. 
Told Wyoh last night I didn’" object 
to long odds.” 

44 ‘One in ten’ is what ' you said, 
Mannie.” 

“Da, Wyoh. Show me these odds. 
Fll tap fast. But can you?” 

“No, Manuel, I can’t.” 

“Then why we talk-talk? / cant 
see any chance.” 

“Nor I, Manuel. But we approach 
it differently. Revolution is an art 
that I pursue rather than a goal I 
expect to achieve. Nor is this a 
source of dismay; a lost cause can 
be as spiritually satisfying as a yie- 
tory.” 

“Not me. Sorry.” 

“Mannie.” Wyoh said suddenly, 
“ask Mike.” 

T stared. “You serious?” 

“Quite serious. If anyone can fig- 
ure the odds, Mike should be able 
to. Don’t you think?” 

' “Urn. Possible.” 

“Who, if I may ask,” Prof put in, 
“is Mike?” 

I shrugged. “Oh, just a no-body.” 
“Mike is Mannie’s best friend. 
He’s very good at figuring odds.” 
“A bookie? My dear, if we bring 
in a fourth party we start by violat- 
ing the cell principle.” 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


47 



“I don’t see why,” Wyoh an- 
swered. “Mike could be a member 
of the cell Mannie will head.” 
“Mmm . true. I withdraw ob- 
jection. He is safe? You vouch for 
him? Or you, Manuel?” 

I said, “He’s dishonest, immature, 
practical joker, not interested in pol- 
itics.” 

“Mannie, I’m going to tell Mike 
you said that. Professor, he’s noth- 
ing of the sort — and we need him 
Uh, in fact he might be our chair- 
man, and we three the cell under 
him. The executive cell ” 

“Wyoh, you getting enough oxv- 
gen?” 

“I’m okay, I haven’t been guzzlmg 
it the way you have. Think, Man- 
nie. Use imagination.” 

“I must confess,” said Prof, 
“that I find these conflicting reports 
very conflicting.” 

“Mannie?” 

“Oh, hell.” 

S o we told him, between us, all 
about Mike, how he woke up. 
got his name, met Wyoh Prof ac- 
cepted idea of a self-aware comput- 
er easier than I accepted idea of 
snow first time I saw. Prof just 
nodded and said, “Go on.” 

But presently he said. “This is 
the Warden’s own computer? Why 
not invite the Warden to our meet- 
ings and be done with it?” 

We tried to reassure him. At last 
I said, “Put it this way. M ; ke is his 
own boy, just as you are. Call him 
rational anarchist, for he’s rational 
and he feels no lovalty to anv gov- 
ernment ” 

“If this machine is not loyal to 


its owners, why expect it to be loyal 
to you?” 

“A feeling. I treat Mike well as 
I know how, he treats me same 
way.” I told how Mike had taken 
precautions to protect me. “I’m 
not sure he could betray me to any- 
one who didn’t have those signals, 
one to secure phone, other to re- 
trieve what I’ve talked about or 
stored with him. Machines don’t 
think way people do. But feel dead 
sure he wouldn’t want to betray me 
. and probably could protect me 
even if somebody got those signals.” 

“Mannie,” suggested Wyon, “why 
not call him? Once Professor de la 
Paz talks to him he will know why 
we trust Mike. Professor, we don’t 
have to tell Mike any secrets until 
you feel sure of him.” 

“I see no harm in that.” 

“Matter of fact,” I admitted, “al- 
ready told him some* secrets.” I told 
them about recording last night’s 
meeting and how I stored it. 

Prof was distressed, Wyoh was 
worried. I said, “Damp it! Nobody 
but me knows retrieval signal. 
Wyoh, you know how Mike behaved 
about your pictures; won’t *et me 
have those pictures even though l 
suggested lock on them. But if you 
two will stop oscillating, I’ll call 
him, make sure that nobody has re- 
trieved that recording, and tell him 
to erase. Then it’s gone forever. 
Computer memory is all or nothing 
Or can go one better. Call Mike and 
have him play record back «nto re- 
corder, wiping storage. No huhu.” 

“Don’t bother,” said Wyoh 
“Professor, I trust Mike — and «o 
will you.”

IF 



“On second thought,” Prof ad- 
mitted, “I see little hazard from a 
recording of last night’s meeting. 
One that large always contains spies 
and one of them may have used a 
recorder as you did, Manuel. I was 
upset at what appeared to be your 
indiscretion — a weakness a member 
of a conspiracy must never have 
especially one at the top, as you 
are.” 

“Was not member of conspiracy 
when I fed that recording into Mike. 
And am not now unless somebody 
quotes odds better than those so 
far!” 

“I retract; you were not indis- 
creet. But are you seriously suggest- 
ing that this machine can predict 
the outcome of a revolution?” 

“Don’t know.” 

*7 think he can!” said Wyoh. 

“Hold it, Wyoh. Prof, he couid 
predict if fed all significant data.” 

“That’s my point, Manuel. I do 
not doubt that this machine can 
solve problems I cannot grasp. But 
one of this scope? It would have to 
know — oh, goodness! — all of human 
history, all details of the entire so- 
cial, political, and economic sit- 
uation on Terra today and the same 
for Luna, a wide knowledge of psy- 
chology in all its ramifications, a 
wider knowledge of technology' with 
all its possibilities, weaponry com- 
munications, strategy and .actics, 
agitprop techniques, classic author- 
ities such as Clausewitz, Guevera, 
Morgenstern, Machiavelli.” 

“Is that all?” 

“ ‘Is that altT My dear boy!” 

“Prof, how many history books 
have you read?” 


“1 do not know. In excess of a 
thousand.” 

“Mike can zip through that many 
this afternoon, speed limited only 
by scanning method. He can store 
data much faster. Soon — minutes — 
he would have every fact correlated 
with everything else he knows, dis- 
crepancies ncted, probability values 
assigned to uncertainties. Prof, Mike 
reads every word of every news- 
paper up from Terra. Reads all 
technical publications. Reads fiction 
— knows it’s fiction — because isn’t 
enough to keep him busy and is al- 
ways hungry for more. If is any 
book he should read to solve this, 
say so. He can cram it down fast 
as I get it to him.” 

P rof blinked. “I stand corrected. 

Very well, let us see if he can 
cope with it. I still think there is 
something known as intuition’ and 
‘human judgment.’ ” 

“Mike has intuition,” Wyoh said. 
“Feminine intuition, that is.” 

“As for ‘human judgment,* ” I 
added, “Mike isn’t human. But all 
he knows he got from humans. Let’s 
get you acquainted.” 

So I phoned. “Hi, Mike!” 

“Hello, Man my only male friend. 
Greetings, Wyoh my only femfale 
friend. I hear a third person. J con- 
jecture that it may be Professor Ber- 
nardo de la Paz.” 

Prof looked startled, then delight- 
ed. I said, “Too right, Mike. That’s 
why I called you; Professor is not- 
stupid.” 

“Thank you, Man! Professor Ber- 
nardo de la Paz, I am delighted to 
meet you.” 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


49 



“I am delighted to meet you, too, 
sir.” Prof hesitated, went on. “Mi — 
Senor Holmes, may I ask how you 
knew that I was here?” 

“I am sorry, sir; I cannot an- 
swer. Man? ‘You know my meth- 
ods.’” 

“Mike is being crafty. Prof. It in- 
volves something he learned doing a 
confidential job for me. So he 
threw me a hint to let you think 
that he had identified you by hear- 
ing your presence — and he can in- 
deed tell much from respiration and 
heart beat . mass, approximate 
age, sex and quite a bit about health. 
Mike’s medical storage is as full as 
any other.” 

“I am happy to say,” Mike added 
seriously, “that I detect no signs of 
cardiac or respiratory trouble, un- 
usual for a man of the Professor’s 
age who has spent so many years 
Earthside. I congratulate you, sir.” 
“Thank you, Senor Holmes.” 

“My pleasure. Professor Bernardo 
de la Paz.” 

“Once he knew your identity, he 
knew how old you are, when you 
were shipped and what for, anything 
that ever appeared about you in 
Lunatic or Moonglow or any Lunar 
publication, including picture — your 
bank balance, whether you pay bills 
on time, and much more. Mike re- 
trieved this in a split second once he 
had your name. What he didn’t tell 
— because was my business — is that 
he knew I had invited you here. So 
it’s a short jump to guess that 
you’re still here when he heard 
heartbeat and breathing that 
matched you. Mike, no need to say 
‘Professor Bernardo de la Paz’ each 


time; ‘Professor’ or ‘Prof* is 
enough.” 

“Noted, Man. But he addressed 
me formally, with honorific.” 

“So both of you relax. Prof, you 
can scan it? Mike knows much, 
doesn’t tell all.” 

“I am impressed!” 

“Mike is a fair dinkum thinkum. 
You’ll see. Mike, I bet Professor 
three to two that Yankees would 
win pennant again. How chances?” 
“I am sorry to hear it, Man. The 
correct odds, this early in the year 
and based on past performances of 
teams and players, are one to four 
point seven two the other way.” 
“Can’t be that bad!” 

4 4 T’m sorry, Man. I will print out 
A the calculations if you wish. 
But I recommend that you buy back 
your wager. The Yankees have a 
favorable chance to defeat any 
single team . but the combined 
chances of defeating all teams in 
the league, including such factors as 
weather, accidents, and other vari- 
ables for the season ahead, place 
the club on the short end of the 
odds I gave you.” 

“Prof, want to sell that bet?” 
“Certainly, Manuel.” 

“Price?” 

“Three hundred Hong Kong dol- 
lars.” 

“You old thief!” 

“Manuel, as your former teacher 
I would be false to you if 1 did not 
permit you to learn from mistakes. 
Senor Holmes — Mike my friend— 
Mav I call you ‘friend’ 9 ” 

“Please do.” (Mike almost 
purred.)

“Mike amigo, do you also tout 
horse races?” 

*1 often calculate odds on horse 
races; the civil service computermen 
frequently program such requests. 
But the results are so at variance 
with expectations that I have con- 
cluded either that the data are too 
meager, or the horses or riders are 
not honest. Possibly all three. How- 
ever, I can give you a formula 
which will pay a steady return if 
played consistently.” 

Prof looked eager. “Wliar is it? 
May one ask?” 

“One may. Bet the leading ap- 
prentice jockey to place. He is al- 
ways given good mounts and they 
carry less weight. But don’t bet him 
on the nose.” 

‘“Leading apprentice’ . hmm. 
Manuel, do you have the correct

“Prof, which do you want? Get 
a bet down before post time? Or 
settle what we set out 10 ?” 

“Unh, sorry. Please carry on.

“Mike, I gave you a recording 
last night.” I leaned close to pick- 
ups and whispered: “Bastille Day 
“Retrieved, Man.” 

“Thought about it?” 

“In many ways. Wyoh, you speak 
most dramatically.” 

“Thank you, Mike.” 

“Prof, can you get vour mind off 
ponies?” 

“Eh? Certainly, I am all ears.” 
“Then quit doing odds under your 
breath. Mike can do them faster.” 
“I was not wasting time; f he fi- 
nancing of . joint ventures such 
as ours is always difficult. However.

I shall table it. J am all attention.” 
“I want Mike to do a trial pro- 
jection. Mike, in that recording, you 
heard Wyoh say we had to have 
free trade with Terra. You heard 
Prof say we should clamp an em- 
bargo on shipping food to Terra. 
Who’s right?” 

“Your question is indeterminate, 
Man.” 

“What did I leave out?” 

“Shall I rephrase it, Man?” 
“Sure. Give us discussion.” 

«Tn immediate terms Wyoh’s pro- 
Aposal would be of great ad- 
vantage to the people of Luna. The 
price of foodstuffs at catapult head 
would increase by a factor of at 
least four. This takes into account 
a slight rise in wholesale prices on 
Terra, ‘slight’ because the Authority 
now sells at approximately the free 
market price. This disregards sub- 
sidized, dumped and donated food- 
stuffs, most of which come from the 
large profit caused by the controlled 
low price at catapult head. I will 
say no more about minor variable* 
as they are swallowed by major 
ones. Let it stand that the immed- 
iate effect here would be a price in- 
crease of the close order of four- 
fold.” 

“Hear that. Professor?” 

“Please, dear lady. I never dis- 
puted it.” 

“The profit, increase to the grow- 
er is more than fourfold because, as 
Wyoh pointed out, he now must 
buy water and other items at con- 
trolled high prices. Assuming 3 free 
market throughout the sequence his 
profit enhancement will be of the 

51 



close order of sixfold. But this 
would be offset by another factor: 
Higher prices for exports would 
cause higher prices for everything 
consumed in Luna, goods and labor. 
The total effect would be an en- 
hanced standard of living for ail on 
the close order of twofold. This 
would be accompanied by vigorous 
effort to drill and seal more farming 
tunnels, mine more ice, improve 
growing methods, all leading to 
greater export. However, the lerran 
Market is so large and food short- 
age so chronic that reduction in 
profit from increase of export is not 
a major factor.” 

Prof said, “But, Senor Mike, that 
would only hasten the day that 
Luna is exhausted!” 

“The projection was specified as 
immediate, Senor Professor. Shall I 
continue in longer range on the 
basis of your remarks?” 

“By all means!” 

“Luna’s mass to three significant 
figures is seven point three six times 
ten to the nineteenth power tonnes. 
Thus, holding other variables con- 
stant including Lunar and Terran 
populations, the present differential 
rate of export in tonnes could con 
tinue for seven point three six times 
ten to the twelfth years before using 
up one per cent of Luna — round it 
as seven thousand billion vears ” 
“What! Are you sure?” 

“You are invited to check. Pro- 
fessor.” 

I said, “Mike, this a joke? If so, 
not funny even once!” 

“It is not a joke, Man.” 
“Anyhow,” Prof added, recover- 
ing, “it’s not Luna’s crust we are 

52 


shipping. It*s out life blood -water 
and organic matter. Not rock.” 

“I took that into consideration, 
Professor. This projection is based 
on controlled transmutation -any 
isotope into any other and postulat- 
ing power for any reaction not exo- 
energetic. Rock would be shipped — 
transformed into wheat and beef 
and other foodstuffs.” 

“But we don’t know how to do 
that! Amigo, this is ridiculous!” 
“But we will know how to do it.” 
“Mike is right, Prof,” I put in. 
“Sure, today we haven’t a glimmer. 
But will. Mike, did you compute 
how many years till we have this? 
Might take a flier in stocks.” 

Mike answered in sad voice, 
“Man my only male friend save for 
the Professor whom I hope will be 
my friend, I tried. I failed The 
question is indeterminate.” 

“Why?” 

“Because it involves a break- 
through in theory. There is no way 
m all my data to predict when and 
where genius may appear.” 

P rof sighed. “Mike amigo, I don’t 
know whether to be relieved or 
disappointed Then that projection 
didn’t mean anything?” 

“Of course it meant something!” 
said Wyoh. “It means we’ll di<? it out 
when we need it. Tell him. Mike!” 
“Wyoh I am most sorry. Your 
assertion is, in effect, exactly what 
I was looking for. But the answer 
still remains: Genius is where you 
find it. No. I am so sorry.” 

I said, “Then Prof is right? When 
comes to placing bets?” 

‘.‘One moment, Man. There is a 

IP 



special solution suggested by the 
Professor’s speech last night- return 
shipping, tonne for tonne.” 

“Yes, but can’t do that.” 

“If the cost is low enough, Ter- 
rans would do so. That can be 
achieved with only minor refine- 
ment, not a break-through, to wit, 
freight transportation up from Terra 
as cheap as catapulting down to 
Terra.” 

“You call this ‘minor’?” 

“I call it minor compared with 
the other problem, Man.” 

“Mike dear, how long? When do 
we get it?” 

“Wyoh, a rough projection, based 
on poor data and largely intuitive, 
would be on the order of fifty 
years.” 

“‘Fifty years’? Why, that’s noth- 
ing! We can have free trade.” 
“Wyoh, I said ‘on the order of — 
I did not say ‘on the close order 
of.’” 

“It makes a difference?” 

“Does,” I told her. “What Mike 
said was that he doesn’t expect it 
sooner than five years but would 
be surprised if much longer than five 
hundred. Eh, Mike?” 

“Correct, Man.” 

“So need another projection. Prof 
pointed out that we ship water and 
organic matter and don’t get it 
back — agree, Wyoh?” 

“Oh, sure. I just don’t think it’s 
urgent. We’ll solve it when we 
reach it.” 

“Okay, Mike. No cheap shipping, 
no transmutation. How long till 
trouble?” 

“Seven years.” 

“ ‘ Seven yearsV ” Wyoh jumped 


up, stared at phone. “Mike aoney! 
You don’t mean that?” 

“Wyoh,” he said plaintively “I 
did my best. The problem has an 
indeterminately large number of vari- 
ables. I ran several thousand solu- 
tions using many assumptions. The 
happiest answer came from as- 
suming no increase in tonnage, no 
increase in Lunar population —re- 
striction of births strongly enforced 
— and a greatly enhanced search for 
ice in order to maintain the water 
supply. That gave an answer of 
slightly over twenty years. All other 
answers were worse.” 

Wyoh, much sobered, said, “What 
happens in seven years?” 

“The answer of seven years from 
now I reached by assuming the 
present situation, no change in 
Authority policy, and all major 
variables extrapolated from the em- 
piricals implicit in their past be- 
havior — a conservative answer of 
highest probability from available 
data. Twenty-eighty-two is the year 
I expect food riots. 

Cannibalism should not occur for 
at least two years thereafter.” 
“‘Cannibalism’!” She turned and 
buried head against Profs chest. 

H e patted her, said gently, “I’m 
sorry, Wyoh. People do not 
realize how precarious our ecology 
is. Even so, it shocks me. I know 
water runs down hill . but didn’t 
dream how terribly soon it will 
reach bottom.” 

She straightened up and face was 
calm. “Okay, Professor, I was 
wrong. Embargo it must be — and all 
that that implies. Let’s get busy.

Let’s find out from Mike what out 
chances are. You trust him now — 
don’t you?** 

“Yes, dear lady, I do. We must 
have him on our side. Well, Man- 
uel?” 

Took time to impress Mike with 
how serious we were, make him un- 
derstand that “jokes” could kill us 
(this to machine who could not 
know human death) and to get as- 
surance that he could and would 
protect secrets no matter what re- 
trieval program was used — even our 
signals if not from us. Mike was 
hurt that I could doubt him but 
matter too serious to risk slip. 

Then took two hours to program 
and re-program and change as- 
sumptions and investigate side issues 
before all four — Mike, Prof, Wyoh, 
self — were satisfied that we had de- 
fined it. I.e., what chance had rev- 
olution — this revolution, .headed by 
us, success required before “Food 
Riots Day,” against Authority with 
bare hands — against power of all 
Terra, all eleven billions, to bear us 
down and inflict their will. All with 
no rabbits out of hats, with cer- 
tainty of betrayal and stupidity and 
faint-heartedness, and fact that no 
one of us was genius, nor important 
in Lunar affairs. 

Prof made sure that Mike knew 
history, psychology, economics, 
name it. Toward end Mike was 
pointing out far more variables than 
Prof. 

At last we agreed that program- 
ming was done — or that we could 
think of no other significant factor. 
Mike then said, “This is an indeter- 
minate problem. How shall I solve 


it? Pessimistically? Or optimistical- 
ly? Or a range of probabilities ex- 
pressed as a curve, or several 
curves? Professor my friend?” 
“Manuel?” 

I said, “Mike, when- 1 roll a die, 
it’s one in six it turns ace. I don’t 
ask shopkeeper to float it, nor do I 
caliper it, or worry about somebody 
blowing on it. Don’t give happy an- 
swer, nor pessimistic; don’t shove 
curves at us. Just tell in one sen- 
tence: What chances? Even? One in 
a thousand? None? Or whatever.” 
“Yes, Manuel Garcia O’Kelly my 
first male friend.” 

For thirteen and a half minutes 
was no sound, while Wyoh chew- 
ed knuckles. Never known Mike to 
take so long. Must have consulted 
every book he ever read and worn 
edges off random numbers. Was be- 
ginning to believe that he had been 
overloaded and either burnt out 
something or gone into cybernetic 
breakdown that requires computer 
equivalent of lobotomy. 

Finally he spoke. “Manuel my 
friend, I am terribly sorry!” 

“What’s trouble, Mike?” 

“I have tried and tried, checked 
and checked. There is but one 
chance in seven of winningF’ 

XIII 

I look at Wyoh, she looks at me; 

we laugh. I jump up and yip, 
“Hooray!” Wyoh starts to cry, 
throws arms around Prof, kisses 
him. 

Mike said plaintively, “I do not 
understand. The chances are seven 
to one against us, Not for us.”

IF 



Wyofa stopped slobbering Prof 
Mid said. “Hear that? Mike said ‘us.’ 
He included himself.” 

“Of course. Mike old cobber, we 
understood. But ever know a Loonie 
to refuse to bet when he stood a 
big fat chance of one in seven?” 

“I have known only you three. 
Not sufficient data for a curve.” 
“Well . we’re Loonies. Loonies 
bet. Hell, we have to! They shipped 
us up and bet us we couldn’t stay 
alive. We fooled ’em. We’ll fool ’em 
again! Wyoh. Where’s your pouch? 
Get red hat. Put on Mike. Kiss him. 
Let’s have a drink. One for Mike, 
too — want a drink, Mike?” 

“I wish that I could have a 
drink,” Mike answered wistfully, 
“as I have wondered about the sub- 
jective effect of ethanol on the hu- 
man nervous system — I conjecture 
that it must be similar to a slight 
overvoltage. But since I cannot, 
please have one in my place.” 
“Program accepted. Running. 
Wyoh, where’s hatl ” 

Phone was flat to wall, let into 
rock — no place to hang hat. So we 
placed it on writing shelf and toast- 
ed Mike and called him “Comrade!” 
and almost he cried. His voice fug- 
ged up. Then Wyoh borrowed Lib- 
erty Cap and put on me and kissed 
me into conspiracy, officially this 
time, and so all out that my eldest 
wife would faint did she see. Then 
she took hat and put on Prof and 
gave him same treatment and I was 
glad Mike had reported h*s heart 
okay. 

Then she put it on own head and 
went to phone, leaned close, mouth 
between binaurais and made kissing 


sounds. “That’s for you, Mike dear. 
Is Michelle there?” 

Blimey if he didn’t answer in so- 
prano voice: “Right here, darling — 
and I am so ’appee!” 

So Michelle got a kiss, and I had 
to explain to Prof who “Michelle” 
was and introduce him. He was for- 
mal, sucking air and whistling and 
clasping hands. Sometimes I think 
Prof was not right in his head. 

Wyoh poured more vodka. Prof 
caught her, mixed ours with coffee, 
hers with chai, honey in all. “We 
have declared the Revolution,” he 
said firmly, “now we execute it. 
With clear heads. Manuel, you were 
opted chairman. Shall we begin?” 
“Mike is chairman,” I said. “Ob- 
vious. Secretary, too. We’ll never 
keep anything in writing; first se- 
curity rule. With Mike, don’t need 
to. Let's bat it around and see 
where we are; I'm new to business.” 
“And,” said Prof, “still on the 
subject of security, the secret erf 
Mike should be restricted to this 
executive cell, subject to unanimous 
agreement — all three of us — correc- 
tion: all four of us — that it must be 
extended.” 

“What secret?” asked Wyoh. 
“Mike agreed to keep our secrets. 
He's safer than we are. He can’t oe 
brainwashed. Can you be, Mike?” 

‘1 could be brainwashed,” Mike 
admitted, “by enough voltage. Or 
by being smashed, or subjected to 
solvents, or positive entropy through 
other means. I find the concept dis- 
turbing. But if by ‘brainwashing* 
you mean could I be compelled to 
surrender our secrets, the answer is 
an unmodified negative.”

I said, “Wye, Prof means secret 
of Mike himself. Mike old pal, 
you’re our secret weapon — you 
know that, don’t you?” 

H e answered self-consciously, “It 
was necessary to take that in- 
to consideration in computing the 
odds” 

“How were odds without you, 
comrade? Bad?” 

“They were not good. Not of the 
same order.” 

“Won’t press you. But a secret 
weapon must be secret. Mike, does 
anybody else suspect that you are 
alive?” 

“Am I alive?” His voice held 
tragic loneliness. 

“Ub, won’t argue semantics. Sure 
you’re alive!” 

“I was not sure. It is good to be 
alive. No, Mannie my first friend, 
you three alone know it. Mv three 
friends.” 

“That’s how must be if bet’s to 
pay off. Is okay? Us three and never 
talk to anybody else?” 

“But we’ll talk to you lots!” Wyoh 
put in. 

“It is not only okay,” Mike said 
bluntly, “it is necessary. It was a 
factor in the odds.” 

“That settles it,” I said. “They 
have everything else; we have Mike. 
We keep it that way. Say! MiKe. I 
just had a horrid. We fight Terra?” 
“We will fight Terra . unless 
we lose before that time.” 

“Uh, riddle this. Any computers 
smart as you? Any awake?” 

He hesitated. “I don’t know, 
Man.” 

“No data?” 

54 


“Insufficient data. I have watched 
for both factors, not only in tech- 
nical journals but everywhere else. 
There are no computers on the 
market of my present capacity . 
but one of my model could be 
augmented just as I have been. 
Furthermore an experimental com- 
puter of great capacity might be 
classified and go unreported in the 
literature.” 

“Mmm . chance we have to 
take.” 

“Yes,' Man.” 

“There aren’t any computers as 
smart as Mike!” Wyoh said scorn- 
fully, “Don’t be silly, Mannie.” 
“Wyoh, Man was not being silly. 
Man, I saw one disturbing report. 
It was claimed that attempts are 
being made at the University of 
Peiping to combine compmers with 
human brains to achieve massive 
capacity. A computing Cyborg.” 
“They say how?” 

“The item was non-techmcal.** 
“Well . won’t worry about 
what can’t help. Right, Prof?” 
“Correct, Manuel. A revolution- 
ist must keep his mind free of 
worry or the pressure becomes in- 
tolerable.” 

“I don’t believe a word of it,” 
Wyoh added. “We’ve got Mike and 
we’re going to win! Mike dea**, you 
say we’re going to fight Terra — and 
Mannie says that’s one battle we 
can’t win. You have some idea of 
how we can win, or you wouldn’t 
have given us even one chance in 
seven. So what is it?” 

“Throw rocks at them,” Mike 
answered. 

“Not funny,” I told him. “Wyoh, 

IF 





don’t borrow trouble. Haven't even 
settled bow we leave this pooka 
without being nabbed. Mike, Prof 
says nine guards were killed Iasi 
■ight and Wyoh says twenty-seven 
is whole bodyguard. Leaving eigh- 
teen. Do you know if that’s true, do 
you know where they are and what 
they are up to? Can’t put on a rev- 
olution if we dasn’t stir out.” 

# 

P rof interrupted. “That’s a tem- 
porary exigency. Manuel, one 
we can cepe with. The point Wyom- 
ing rased is basic and should be 
discussed. And daily, until suWed. 
I am interested in Mike’s thoughts.* 
“Okay, okay — but will you wah 
while Mike answers me?” 

“Scarry, sir” 

“Mike?" 

‘Man, the official number of 
Warden’s bodyguards is twenty- 
seven. If nine were killed the official 
number is now eighteen.” 

“You keep saying ’official nunv 
ber.’ Why?” 

”1 have incomplete data which 
might be relevant. Let me stare 
them before advancing even tenta- 
tive conclusions. Nominally the Se- 
curity Officer’s dep artme n t aside 
from clerks consists only of the 
bodyguard. But I handle oayroKs 
for Authority Complex and twenty^ 
seven is not the number of person- 
nel charged against the Security De- 
partment.” 

Prof nodded “Company spies.” 
“Hold it. Prof. Who are these 
other people?” 

Mike answered, “They are simply 
account numbers, Man. I conjecture 
that the names they represent are 


in the Security Chiefs data stor- 
age location.” 

“Wait, Mike. Security Chief Al- 
varez uses you for files?” 

“I conjecture that to be true, 
since his storage location is under 
a locked retrieval signal.” 

I said, “Bloody,” and added, 
“Prof, isn’t that sweet? He uses 
Mike to keep records, Mike knows 
where they are — can’t touch ’em!” 

Tried to explain to Prof and 
Wyoh sorts of memory a thinkum 
has. Permanent memories that can’t 
be erased became patterns be logic 
itself, how it thinks; short-term 
memories used for current programs 
and then erased like memories 
which tell you whether you have 
honeyed coffee; temporary memo- 
ries held long as necessary — milli- 
seconds, days, years — but erased 
when no Longer needed; perman- 
ently stored data like a human be- 
ing's education — but learned perfect- 
ly and never forgotten — though may 
be condensed, rearran ged, relocated, 
edited — and Last but not finally tong 
fids of special memories ranging 
from memoranda files through very 
complex special programs, and each 
location tagged by own retrieval 
signal and tacked or not, with end- 
less possibilities on lock signals: se- 
quential parallel, temporal, situa- 
tional, others. 

Don’t explain computers to lay- 
men. Simpler to explain sex to a 
virgin. Wyoh couldn’t see why, if 
Mike knew where Alvarez kept rec- 
ords, Mike didn’t trot over and 
fetch 

I gave op. “Mice, can you ex- 
plain?” 



“I will try, Man. Wyoh, there is 
bo way for me to retrieve locked 
data other than through external 
programming. I cannot program my- 
self for such retrieval; my logic 
structure does not permit it. I must 
receive the signal as an external 
input.” 

“Well, for Bog’s sake, what is this 
precious signal?” 

“It is,” Mike said ,simply, “ ‘Spe- 
cial File Zebra’ ” — and waited. 

itTVyrike!” 1 said. “Unlock ‘Spe- 

iVl cial File Zebra.’ ” He did, 
and stuff started spilling out. 

Had to convince Wyoh that Mike 
hadn’t been stubborn. He hadn’t. He 
almost begged us to tickle him 'on 
that spot. Sure, he knew signal. Had 
to. But had to come from outside, 
that was how he was built. 

“Mike, remind me to check with 
you all special-purpose locked-re- 
trieval signals. May strike ice other 
places.” 

“So I conjectured, Man.” 

“Okay, we’ll get to it later. Now 
back up and go over this stuff slow- 
ly. And, Mike, as you read out, 
store again, without erasing, under 
*Rastille Day’ and tag it ‘Fink File.’ 
Okay?” 

“Programmed and running.” 

“Do that with anything new he 
puts in, too.” 

Prime prize was list of names by 
warrens, some two hundred, each 
keyed with a code Mike identified 
with those blind pay accounts. 

Mike read out Hotig Kong Luna 
list and was hardly started when 
Wyoh gasped, “Stop, Mike! I’ve got 
to write these down!” 


I said, “Hey! No writing! What’s 
huhu?” 

“That woman, Sylvia Chiang, is 
comrade secretary back home! But 
— But that means the Warden has 
our whole organization!” 

“No, dear Wyoming,” Prof cor- 
rected. “It means we have his or- 
ganization.” 

“But — ’’ 

“I see what Prof means,” I told 
her. “ Our organization is just us 
three and Mike. Which Warden 
doesn’t know. But now we know his 
organization. So shush and let Mike 
read. But don’t write; you have this 
list — from Mike — any time you 
phone him. Mike, note that Chiang 
woman is organization secretary, 
former organization, in Kongville.” 

“Noted.” 

Wyoh boiled over as she heard 
names of undercover finks in her 
town but limited herself to noting 
facts about ones she knew. Not 
all were “comrades” but enough 
that she stayed riled up. Novy Lenin- 
grad names didn’t mean much to us; 
Prof recognized three, Wyoh one. 
When came Luna City Prof noted 
over half as being “comrades.” f 
recognized several, not as fake sub- 
versives but as acquaintances. Not 
friends. 

Don’t know what it would do to 
me to find someone I trusted on 
boss fink’s payroll. But would shake 
me. 

It shook Wyoh. When Mike tin- 
ished she said, “I’ve got to get 
home! Never in my life have I 
helped to eliminate anyone but I 
am going to enjoy putting the black 
on these spies!” 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

Prof said quietly, “No one will 
be eliminated, dear Wyoming.” 
“What? Professor, can’t you take 
it? Though I’ve never killed any- 
one, I’ve always known it might 
have to be done.” 

He shook head. “Killing is not 
the way to handle a spy, not when 
he doesn’t now that you know that 
he is a spy.” 

She blinked. “I must be dense.” 
“No, dear lady. Instead you have 
a charming honesty . a weak- 
ness you must guard against. The 
thing to do with a spy is to let 
him breathe, encyst him with loyal 
comrades, and feed him harmless 
information to please his employ- 
ers. These creatures will be taken 
into our organization. Don t look 
shocked; they will be in very special 
cells. ‘Cages’ is a better word. But 
it would be the greatest waste to 
eliminate them. Not only would 
each spy be replaced with someone 
new but also killing these traitors 
would tell the Warden that we have 
penetrated his secrets. Mike amigo 
mio, there should be in that file a 
dossier on me. Will you see?” 

Were long notes on Prof, and I 
was embarrassed as they added up 
to “harmless old fool.” He was 
tagged as a subversive — that was 
why he had been sent to The Rock 
— as a member of underground 
group in Luna City. But was de- 
scribed as a “troublemaker” in or- 
ganization, one who rarely agreed 
with others. 

P rof dimpled and looked pleased. 

“I must consider trying to sell 
out and get myself placed on the 


Warden’s payroll.” Wyoh did not 
think this funny, especially when 
he made clear was not joke, merely 
unsure tactic was practical. “Revo- 
lutions must be financed, dear lady, 
and one way is for a revolutionary 
to become a police spy. It is prob- 
able that some of those prima-fade 
traitors are actually on our side." 
“I wouldn’t trust them!” 

“Ah, yes, that is the rub with 
double agents, to be certain where 
their loyalties — if any — lie. Do 
you wish your own dossier? Or 
would you rather hear it in pri- 
vate?” 

Wyoh’s record showed no sur- 
prises. Warden’s finks had tabbed her 
years back. But I was surprised that 
I had a record, too — routine check 
made when I was cleared to work 
in Authority Complex. Was classed 
as “non-political” and someone had 
added “not too bright” which was 
both unkind and true or why would 
I get mixed up in revolution? 

Prof had Mike stoo read-out 
(hours more), leaned back and 
looked thoughtful. “One thing is 
clear,” he said. “The Warden knew 
plenty about Wyoming and myself 
long ago. But you, Manuel, are not 
on his black list.” 

“After last night?” 

“Ah so. Mike, do you have any- 
thing in that file entered in the last 
twenty-four hours?” 

Nothing. Prof said, “Wyoming is 
right that we cannot stay here for- 
ever. Manuel, how many names did 
you recognize? Six, was it? Did you 
see any of them last night?” 

“No. But might have seen me.” 
“More likely they missed you in

IF 



the crowd. I did not spot you until 
I came down front and I’ve known 
you since you were a boy But it 
kmost unlikely that Wyoming trav- 
eled from Hong Kong and spoke 
at the meeting without her activity 
being known to the Warden ” He 
looked at Wyoh. “Dear lady, could 
you bring yourself to plav the nom- 
inal role of an old man s tolly?” 

“I suppose so. How, Professoi?” 
Wyoh asked. 

“Manuel is probably in the clear. 
I am not but from my dossier it 
seems unlikely that the Authority’s 
finks will bother to pick me up 
You they may wish to question oi 
even to hold; you are rated as dan- 
gerous. It would be wise for you 
to stay out of sight. This room — 
I’m thinking of renting it for a 
period — weeks or even years. You 
could hide in it — if you do not 
mind the obvious construction that 
would be placed on your staying 
here.” 

Wyoh chuckled. “Why, you dar- 
ling! Do you think I care what 
anyone thinks? I’d be delighted to 
play the role of your bundle baby 
— and don’t be too sure I’d be 
just playing.” 

“Never tease an old dog,” he said 
mildly. “He might still have one bite. 
I may occupy that couch most 
nights. Manuel, I intend to resume 
my usual ways. And so should 
you. 

“While I feel that it will take 
a busy cossack to arrest me, I will 
sleep sounder in this hide-away. But 
in addition to being a hideout this 
room is good for cell meetings; it 
has a phone.” 

1ME MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


M ike said, “Professor, may I 
offer a suggestion?” 

“Certainly, amigo, we want your 
thoughts.” 

“I conclude that the hazards in- 
crease with each meeting of our 
executive cell. But meetings need 
not be corporal. You can meet — 
and I can join you if I am wel- 
come — by phone.” 

“You are always welcome. Com- 
rade Mike; we need you. How- 
ever — ” Prof looked worried. 

I said, “Prof, don’t worry about 
anybody listening in.” I explained 
how to place a “Sherlock” call. 
“Phones are safe if Mike super- 
vises call. Remind me. You haven’t 
been told how to reach Mike. How, 
Mike? Prof use my number?” 
Between them, they settled on 
MYSTERIOUS. Prof and Mike 
shared childlike joy in intrigue for 
own sake. I suspect Prof enjoyed 
being a rebel long before he worked 
out his political philosophy, while 
Mike — how could human freedom 
matter to him? Revolution was a 
game. A game that gave him com- 
panionship to show off talents. Mike 
was as conceited a machine as you 
are ever likely to meet. 

“But we still need this room,** 
Prof said, reached into pouch, 
hauled out thick wad of bills. 

I blinked. “Prof, robbed a bank?” 
“Not recently. Perhaps again in 
the future if the Cause requires it. 
A rental period of one lunar should 
do as a starter. Will you arrange it, 
Manuel? The management might be 
surprised to hear my voice; I came 
in through a delivery door.** 

I called manager, bargained for 

61 



dated key, four weeks He asked 
nine hundred Hong Kong; I offered 
nine hundred Authority. He wanted 
to know how many would use room? 
I asked if was policy of Raffles 
to snoop affairs of guests? 

We settled at HK$475; I sent up 
bills, he sent down two dated keys. 
I gave one to Wyoh, one to Prof, 
kept one-day key, knowing they 
would not reset lock unless we failed 
to pay at end of lunar. 

(Earthside I ran into insolent 
practice of requiring hotel guest to 
sign chop — even show identifica- 
tion!) 

1 asked, “What next? Food?” 

“I’m not hungry, Mannie.” 
“Manuel, you asked us to wait 
while Mike settled your questions 
Let’s get hack to the basic prob- 
lem How we are to cope when 
we find ourselves facing Terra, Dav 
id facine Goliath.” 

“Oh Been hoping that would go 
awav Mike? You really have 
ideas?” 

“I said I did, Man.” he answered 
plaintively. “We can throw rocks.” 
“Boq’s sake! No time for jokes.” 
“But. Man.” he protested, “we 
can throw rocks at Terra. We will.” 

XIV 

r I ''ook time to get through my 
skull that Mike was serious, and 
scheme might work Then took long- 
er to show Wyoh and Prof how 
second part was true Yet both parts 
should have been obvious. 

Mike reasoned so: What is 

“war”? One book defined war as 
use of force to achieve political re- 


sult. And “force” is action of om 
body on another applied by mean* 
of energy. 

In war this is done by “weapons" 
— Luna had none. But weapons, 
when Mike examined them as class, 
turned out to be engines for ma- 
nipulating energy. And energy Luna 
had plenty. Solar flux alone is good 
for around one kilowatt per square 
meter of surface at Lunar noon; 
sunpower, though cyclic, is effective- 
ly unlimited. Hydrogen fusion power 
is almost as unlimited and cheaper, 
once ice is mined, magnetic pinch- 
bottle set up 

Luna has energy — how to use? 

But Luna has energy of posi- 
tion; she sits at top of gravity well 
eleven kilometers per second deep 
and kept from falling in by curb 
onlv two and a half km / s high. Mike 
knew that curb: daily he tossed 
grain freighters over it, let them 
slide down hill to Terra. 

Mike had computed what would 
hanoen if a freighter grossing 100 
tonnes ( or same mass of rock) falls 
to Te r ra. unbraked. 

K ; neHc energy as it hits is 
6.250 x 10 12 joules — over six trillion 
joules 

This converts in split second to 
heat Explosion, big one! 

Should have been obvious. Look 
at Luna: What vou see? Thousands 
on thousands of craters — places 
where Somebody got playful throw- 
ins rocks. 

Wyoh said, “Joules don’t mean 
much to me. How does that com- 
pare with H-bombs?” 

“Uh — ” I started to round off 
in head. Mike’s “head” works fast- 


62 


W 



er; he answered, “The concussion 
of a hundred-tonne mass on Terra 
approaches the yield of a two-kilo- 
tonne atomic bomb.” 

“‘Kilo’ is a thousand,” Wyoh 
murmured, “and ‘mega’ is a million 
— why, that’s only one fifty- 
thousandth as much as a hundred- 
megatonne bomb. Wasn’t that the 
size Sovunion used?” 

“Wyoh honey,” I said gently, 
“that’s not how it works. Turn it 
around. A two-kilotonne yield is 
equivalent to exploding two million 
kilograms of trinitrotoluol . and 
a kilo of TNT is quite an explo- 
sion. Ask any drillman. Two million 
kilos will wipe out good-sized town. 
Check, Mike?” 

“Yes, Man. But, Wyoh my only 
female friend, there is another as- 
pect. Multi-megatonne fusion bombs 
are inefficient. The explosion takes 
place in too small a space; most of 
it is wasted. While a hundred-mega- 
tonne bomb is rated as having fifty 
thousand times the yield of a two- 
kilotonne bomb, its destructive effect 
is only about thirteen hundred times 
as great as that of a two-kilotonne 
explosion.” 

“But it seems to me that thirteen 
hundred times is still quite a lot — 
if they are going to use bombs on 
us that much bigger.” 

“True, Wyoh my female friend 
... but Luna has many rocks.” 
“Oh. Yes, so we have.” 
“Comrades,” said Prof, “this is 
outside my competence. In my 
younger or bomb-throwing days my 
experience was limited to something 
of the order of the one-kilogram 
chemical explosion of which you 


spoke, Manuel. But I assume that 
you two know what you are talking 
about.” 

“We do,” Mike agreed. 

“So I accept your figures. To 
bring it down to a scale that I can 
understand this plan requires that 
we capture the catapult. No?” 

“Yes,” Mike and I chorused. 

“Not impossible. Then we must 
hold it and keep it operative. Mike, 
have you considered how your cata- 
pult can be protected against, let 
us say, one small H-tipped torpe- 
do?” 

Discussion went on and on. We 
stopped to eat — stopped business 
under Prof’s rule. Instead Mike told 
jokes, each produced a that-remincfe- 
me from Prof. 

By time we left Raffles Hotel eve- 
ning of May 14th ’75 we had — Mike 
had, with help from Prof — outlined 
plan of Revolution, including major 
options at critical points. 

W hen came time to go, me 
to home and Prof to evening 
class (if not arrested), then home 
for bath and clothes and necessities 
in case he returned that night, be- 
came clear Wyoh did not want to be 
alone in strange hotel. Wyoh was 
stout when bets were down, between 
times soft and vulnerable. 

So I called Mum on a “Sherlock” 
and told her was bringing guest. 

Mum ran her job with style. Any 
spouse could bring guest home for 
meal or year, and our second genera- 
tion was almost as free but must 
ask. Don’t know how other fam- 
ilies work; we have customs firmed 
by a century; they suit us. 


THE MOON 15 A HARSH MISTRESS 



So Mum didn’t ask name, age. 
sex, marital condition; was my right 
and she too proud to ask. All she 
said was: “That’s nice, dear. Have 
you two had dinner? It’s Tuesday, 
you know.” 

“Tuesday” was to remind me that 
our family had eaten early because 
Greg preaches Tuesday evenings. 
But if guest had not eaten, dinner 
would be served. Concession to 
guest, not to me, as with exception 
of Grandpaw we ate when was on 
table or scrounged standing up in 
pantry. 

I assured her we had eaten and 
would make tall effort to be there 
before she needed to leave. Despite 
Loonie mixture of Muslims, Jews, 
Christians, Buddhists and ninety- 
nine other flavors, I suppose Sunday 
is commonest day for church. But 
Greg belongs to sect which had cal- 
culated that sundown Tuesday to 
sundown Wednesday, local time 
Garden of Eden (zone minus-two. 
Terra) was the Sabbath. So we ate 
early in Terran north-hemisphere 
summer months. 

Mum always went to hear Greg 
preach, so was not considerate to 
place duty on her that would clash. 
All of us went occasionally; I man- 
aged several times a year because 
terribly fond of Greg, who taught 
me one trade and helped me switch 
to another when I had to and would 
gladly have made it his arm rather 
than mine. But Mum always went 
— ritual not religion, for she ad- 
mitted to me one night in pillow 
talk that she had no religion with a 
brand on it, then cautioned me not 
to tell Greg. I exacted same caution 


from her. I don’t know Who ii 
cracking; I’m pleased He doesn't 
stop. 

But Greg was Mum’s “boy hus- 
band,” opted when she was very 
young, first wedding after her own. 
Very sentimental about him. Would 
deny fiercely if accused of loving 
him more than other husbands, yet 
took his faith when he was ordained 
and never missed a Tuesday. 

She said, “Is it possible that your 
guest would wish to attend church?** 

I said would see but anyhow we 
would rush, and said good-by. Then 
banged on bathroom door and said, 
“Hurry with skin, Wyoh; we’re short 
on minutes.” 

“One minute!” she called out. 
She’s ungirlish girl; she appeared 
in one minute. “How do I look?” she 
asked. “Prof, will I pass?” 

“Dear Wyoming, I am amazed. 
You were beautiful before, you are 
beautiful now — but utterly unrec- 
ognizable. You’re safe — and I am 
relieved.” 

Then we waited for Prof to trans- 
form into old derelict; he would 
be it to his back corridor, then re- 
appear as well-known teacher in 
front of class, to have witnesses in 
case a yellow boy was waiting to 
grab him. 

It left a moment; I told Wyoh 
about Greg. 

S he said, “Mannie, how good is 
this makeup? Would it pass in 
church? How bright are the lights?” 
“No brighter than here. Good 
job, you’ll get by. But do you want 
to go to church? Nobody pushing.” 
She thought: “It would please 


64 


IF 



your modi — I mean, *your senior 
wife,’ would It not?” 

I answered slowly, “Wyoh, reli- 
gion is your pidgin. But Since 
you ask . yes, nothing would 
start you better in Davis Family 
than going to church with Mum. 
nt go if you do.” 

“Ffl go. I thought your last name 
was ‘O’Kelly’?” 

“Is. Tack ‘Davis’ on with hyphen 
if you want to be formal. Davis 
is First Husband, dead fifty years. 
Is family name and all our wives are 
‘Gospazha Davis’ hyphened with 
every male namd in Davis line plus 
her family name. In practice Mum 
is only ‘Gospazha Davis’ — can call 
her that — and others use first name 
and add Davis if they write a 
cheque or something. Except that 
Ludmilla is ‘Davis-Davis’ because 
proud of double membership, birth 
and option.” 

“I see. Then if a man is ‘John 
Davis,’ he’s a son, but if he has 
some other last name he’s your co- 
husband. But a girl would be ‘Jen- 
ny Davis’ either way, wouldn’t she? 
How do I tell? By her age? No, 
that wouldn’t help. I’m confused! 
And I thought clan marriages were 
complex. Or polyandries — though 
mine wasn't; at least my husbands 
had the same last name.” 

“No trouble. When you hear a 
woman about forty address a fifteen- 
year-old as ‘Mama Milla,’ you’ll 
know which is wife and which is 
daughter. Not even that complex 
as we don’t have daughters home 
past husband-hieh; they get opted. 
But might be visiting. Your husbands 
were named ‘Knott’?” 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


“Oh, no, ‘Fedoseev, Choy Lin and 
Choy Mu.’ I took back my born 
name.” 

Out came Prof. Cackled senilely 
(looked even worse than earlier!), 
we left by three exits, made ren- 
dezvous in main corridor, open for- 
mation. Wyoh and I did not walk 
together, as I might be nabbed; on 
other hand she did not know Luna 
City, a warren so complex even 
nativeborn get lost — so I led and 
she had to keep me in sight. Prof 
trailed to make sure she didn’t lose 
me. 

If I was picked up, Wyoh would 
find public phone, report to Mike, 
then return to hotel and wait for 
Prof. 

But I felt sure that any yellow 
jacket who arrested me would get a 
caress from number-seven arm. 

No huhu. Up to level five and cross 
town by Carver Causeway, up to 
level three and stop at Tube Station 
West to pick up arms and tool kit — 
but not p-suit; would not have been 
in character, I stored it there. One 
yellow uniform at station, showed 
no interest in me. South by well- 
lighted corridors until necessary to 
go outward to reach private easement 
lock thirteen to co-op pressure tun- 
nel serving Davis Tunnels and a doz- 
en other farms. I suppose Prof 
dropped off there but I never looked 
back. 

I delayed locking through our 
door until Wyoh caught up, then 
soon was saying, “Mum, allow me 
to present our guest, Wyma Beth 
Johnson.” 

Mum took her in arms, kissed 
cheek, said, “So glad you could 

65 



come, Wyma dear! Our house if 
yours!” 

See why I love our old biddy? 
Could have quick-frosted Wyoh 
with same words — but was real and 
Wyoh knew. 

H adn’t warned Wyoh about 
switch in names, thought of it 
en route. Some of our kids were 
small and while they grew up de- 
spising Warden, no sense in risking 
prattle about “Wyoming Knott,” 
who’s visiting us. That name was 
listed in “Special File Zebra.” 

So I missed warning her, was new 
to conspiracy. 

But Wyoh caught cue and never 
hobbled. 

Greg was in preaching clothes and 
would have to leave in minutes. 
Mum did not hurry, took Wyoh 
down line of husbands — Grandpaw, 
Greg, Hans — then up line of wives 
— Ludmilla, Lenore, Sidris, Anna — 
with stately grace, then started on 
our kids. 

I said, “Mum? Excuse me, want 
to change arms.” Her eyebrows 
went up a millimeter, meaning: 
“We’ll speak of this but not in front 
of children” — so I added: “Know 
it’s late, Greg’s sneaking look at 
watch. And Wyma and I are going 
to church. So ’scuse, please.” 

She relaxed. “Certainly, dear.” As 
she turned away I saw her arm go 
around Wyoh’s waist, so I relaxed. 

I changed arms, replacing num- 
ber seven with social arm. But was 
excuse to duck into phone cupboard 
and punch “MYCROFTXXX.” 
“Mike, we’re home. But about to 
go to church. Don’t think you can 


listen there, so I’ll check in later. 
Heard from Prof?” 

“Not yet, Man. Which church 
is it? I may have some circuit.” 
“Pillar of Fire Repentance Ta- 
bernacle — ” 

“No reference.” 

“Slow to my speed, pal. Meets 
in West-Three Community Hall. 
That’s south of Station on Ring 
about number — ” 

“I have it. There’s a pickup in- 
side for channels and a phone in 
the corridor outside; I’ll keep an 
ear on both.” 

“I don’t expect trouble, Mike.” 
“It’s what Professor said to do. 
He is reporting now. Do you wish 
to speak to him?” 

“No time. ’Bye!” 

That set pattern : Always keep 
touch with Mike, let him know 
where you are, where you plan to 
be; Mike would listen if he had 
nerve ends there. Discovery I made 
that morning, that Mike could listen 
at dead phone, suggested it. Discov- 
ery bothered me; don’t believe in 
magic. But on thinking I realized a 
phone could be switched on by cen- 
tral switching system without human 
intervention — if switching system 
had volition. Mike had bolshoyeh 
volition. 

How Mike knew a phone was out- 
side that hall is hard to say, since 
“space” could not mean to him 
what means to us. But he carried in 
storage a “map” — structured rela- 
tions — of Luna City’s engineering, 
and could almost always fit what 
we said to what he knew as “Luna 
City”; hardly ever got lost. 

So from day cabal started we 

IF 


66 



kept touch with Mike and each 
other through his widespread ner- 
vous system. Won’t mention again 
unless necessary. 

Mum and Greg and Wyoh were 
waiting at outer door, Mum chomp- 
ing but smiling. I saw she had lent 
Wyoh a stole; Mum was as easy 
about skin as any Loonie, nothing 
new-chummish. But church was an- 
other matter. 

We made it, although Greg went 
straight to platform and we to 
seats. I settled in warm, mindless 
state, going through motions. But 
Wyoh did really listen to Greg’s 
sermon and either knew our hymn 
book or was sight reader. 

W hen we got home young ones 
were in bed and most adults; 
Hans and Sidris were up and Sid- 
ris served cocasoy and cookies, 
then all turned in. Mum assigned 
Wyoh a room in tunnel most of our 
kids lived in, one which had had 
two smaller boys last time I noticed. 
Did not ask how she had reshuf- 
fled. Was clear she was giving my 
guest best we had, or would have 
put Wyoh with one of older girls. 

I slept with Mum that night, 
partly because our senior wife is 
good for nerves — and nerve-rack- 
ing things had happened — and part- 
ly so she would know I was not 
sneaking to Wyoh’s room after 
things were quiet. My workshop, 
where I slept when slept alone, was 
just one bend from Wyoh’s door. 
Mum was telling me, plain as print: 
“Go ahead, dear. Don’t tell me if 
you wish to be mean about it. Sneak 
behind my back.** 


Which neither of us admitted. We 
visited as we got ready for bed, 
chatted after light out, then I turned 
over. 

Instead of saying goodnight Mum 
said, “Manuel? Why does your sweet 
little guest make herself up as an 
Afro? I would think that her natural 
coloration would be more becoming. 
Not that she isn’t perfectly charm- 
ing the way she chooses to be.” 

So rolled over and faced her, and 
explained. Sounded thin, so filled 
in. And found self telling all — ex- 
cept one point: Mike. I included 
Mike — but not as computer — in- 
stead as a man Mum was not likely 
to meet, for security reasons. 

But telling Mum — taking her 
into my subcell, should say, to be- 
come leader of own cell in turn 
— taking Mum into conspiracy was 
not case of husband who can’t keep 
from blurting everything to his wife. 
At most was hasty — but was best 
time if she was to be told. 

Mum was smart. Also able ex- 
ecutive; running big family without 
baring teeth requires that. Was re- 
spected among farm families and 
throughout Luna City. She had been 
up longer than 90% . She could help. 

And would be indispensable in- 
side family. Without her help Wyoh 
and I would find it sticky to use 
phone together (hard to explain), 
keep kids from noticing (impossi- 
ble!) — but with Mum’s help would 
be no problems inside household. 

She listened, sighed, said, “It 
sounds dangerous, dear.” 

“Is,” I said. “Look, Mimi, if 
you don’t want to tackle, say so . 
then forget what I’ve told you.” 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


67 



“Manuel! Don’t even say that. 
You are my husband, dear. I took 
you for better, for worse . and 
your wish is my command." 

(My word, what a lie! But Mimi 
believed it.) 

"I would not let you go into 
danger alone," she went on, "and 
besides — ” 

“What, Mimi?” 

“I think every Loonie dreams of 
the day when we will be free. All 
but some poor spineless rats. I’ve 
never talked about it. There seemed 
to be no point and it’s necessary 
to look up, not down, lift one’s 
burden and go ahead. But I thank 
dear Bog that I have been permit- 
ted to live to see the time come, if 
indeed it has. Explain more about 
it. I am to find three others, is it? 
Three who can be trusted." 

“Don’t hurry. Move slowly. Be 
sure.” 

“Sidris can be trusted. She holds 
her tongue, that one.” 

“Don’t dunk you should pick 
from family. Need to spread out. 
Don’t rush." 

“I shan’t. We’ll talk before I do 
anything. And Manuel, if you want 
my opinion — ” She stopped. 

“Always want your opinion, Mi- 
mi. 

“Don’t mention this to Grand- 
paw. He’s forgetful these days and 
sometimes talkative. Now sleep, 
dear, and don’t dream." 

XV 

F ollowed a long time during which 
would have been possible to 
forget anything as unlikely as revo- 


lution had not details taken so 
much time. Our first purpose was 
not to be noticed. Long distance 
purpose was to make things as much 
worse as possible. 

Yes, worse. Never was a time, 
even at last, when all Loonies 
wanted to throw off Authority, 
wanted it bad enough to revolt. 

All Loonies despised Warden and 
cheated Authority. Didn’t mean they 
were ready to fight and die. If you 
had mentioned “patriotism" to a 
Loonie, he would have stared — or 
thought you were talking about his 
homeland. Were transported French- 
men whose hearts belonged to “La 
Belle Patrie," ex-Germans loyal to 
Vaterland, Russkis who still loved 
Holy Mother Russia. But Lima? 
Luna was “The Rock”, place of 
exile, not thing to love. 

We were as non-political a peo- 
ple as history ever produced. I 
know, I was as numb to politics as 
any until circumstances pitched me 
into it. Wyoming was in it because 
she hated Authority for a personal 
reason. Prof because he despised 
all authority in a detached intellec- 
tual fashion, Mike because he was 
a bored lonely machine and was for 
him “only game in town”. You 
could not have accused us of patriot- 
ism. I came closest because I was 
third generation with total lack of 
affection for any place on Terra. 
Had been there, disliked it and de- 
spised earthworms. Made me more 
“patriotic” than most! 

Average Loonie was interested in 
beer, betting, women and work, in 
that order. “Women” might be sec- 
ond place but first was unlikely, 

IF 


68 



much as women were cherished. 
Loonies had learned there never 
were enough women to go around. 
Slow learners died, as even most 
possessive male can’t stay alert every 
minute. As Prof says, a society 
adapts to facts, or doesn’t survive. 
Loonies adapted to harsh facts — 
or failed and died. But “patriotism” 
was not necessary to survival. 

Like old Chinese saying that 
“Fish aren’t aware of water,” I 
was not aware of any of this until 
I first went to Terra and even 
then did not realize what a blank 
spot was in Loonies under stor- 
age location marked “patriotism” 
until I took part in effort to stir 
them up. Wyoh and her comrades 
had tried to push “patriotism” but- 
ton and got nowhere. Years of 
work. A few thousand members, 
less than 1%. And of that micro- 
scopic number almost 10% had 
been paid spies of boss fink! 

Prof set us straight: Easier to 
get people to hate than to get them 
to love. 

Luckily, Security Chief Alvarez 
gave us a hand. Those nine dead 
finks were replaced with ninety, 
for Authority was goaded into some- 
thing it did reluctantly, namely 
spend money on us, and one folly 
led to another. 

W arden’s bodyguard had never 
been large even in earliest 
days. Prison guards in historical 
meaning were unnecessary and that 
had been one attraction of penal 
colony system — cheap. Warden and 
his Deputy had to be protected and 
visiting vips, but prison itself needed 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


no guards. They even stopped 
guarding ships after became clear 
was not necessary, and in May 
2075 bodyguard was down to its 
cheapest numbers, all of them new 
chum transportees. 

But loss of nine in one night 
scared somebody. 

We knew it scared Alvarez. He 
filed copies of his demands for 
help in “Zebra” file and Mike 
read them. A lag who had been 
a police officer on Terra before 
his conviction and then a body- 
guard all his years in Luna, Al- 
varez was probably most frightened 
and loneliest man in The Rock. He 
demanded more and tougher help, 
threatened to resign civil service 
job if he didn’t get it — just a 
threat, which Authority would have 
known if it had really known Luna. 
If Alvarez had showed up in any 
warren as unarmed civilian, he 
would have stayed breathing only 
as long as not recognized. 

He got his additional guards. We 
never found out who ordered that 
raid. Mort the . Wart had never 
shown such tendencies, had been 
King Log throughout tenure. Per- 
haps Alvarez, having only recently 
succeeded to boss fink spot, wanted 
to make face — may have had am- 
bition to be Warden. But likeliest 
theory is that Warden’s reports on 
“subversive activities” caused Au- 
thority Earthside to order a cleanup. 

One thumb-fingered mistake led 
to another. New bodyguards, instead 
of picked from new transportees, 
weft: elite convict troops, Federated 
Nations crack Peace Dragoons. 
Were mean and tough, did not want 

69 



to go to Luna, and soon realized 
that “temporary police duty” was 
one-way trip. Hated Luna and 
Loonies, and saw us as cause of it 
all. 

Once Alvarez got them, he posted 
a twenty-four hour watch at every 
interwarren tube station and insti- 
tuted passports and passport control. 

Would have been illegal had there 
been laws in Luna, since ninety- 
five per cent of us were theoretical- 
ly free, either bom free, or sentence 
completed. Percentage was higher 
in cities as undischarged transpor- 
tees lived in barrack warrens at 
Complex and came into town only 
two days per lunar they had off 
work. If then, as they had no 
money, but you sometimes saw them 
wandering around, hoping some- 
body would buy a drink. 

But passport system was not 
“illegal” as Warden’s regulations 
were only written law. Was an- 
nounced in papers, we were given 
week to get passports, and at eight 
hundred one morning was put in 
effect Some Loonies hardly ever 
traveled; some traveled on busi- 
ness; some commuted from out- 
lying warrens or even from Luna 
City to Novylen or other way 
Good little boys filled out applica- 
tions, paid fees, were photographed, 
got passport. I was a good little 
boy on Profs advice, paid for pass- 
port and added it to pass I carried 
to work in Complex. 

Few good little boys! Loonies 
did not believe it. Passports? Who- 
ever heard of such a thing? 

Was a trooper at Tube Station 
South that morning, dressed in body- 


guard yellow rather than regimentals 
and looking like he hated it, and 
us. I was not going anywhere; I 
hung back and watched. 

Novylen capsule was announced; 
crowd of thirty-odd headed for gate. 
Gospodin Yellowjacket demanded 
passport of first to reach it. Loonie 
stopped to argue. Second one pushed 
past; guard turned and yelled — 
three or four more shoved past. 
Guard reached for sidearm; some- 
body grabbed his elbow, gun went 
off. Not a laser, a slug gun, noisy. 

Slug hit decking and went whee- 
whee-hoo off somewhere. I faded 
back. One man hurt — that guard. 
When first press of passengers had 
gone down ramp, he was on deck, 
not moving. 

Nobody paid attention; they 
walked around or stepped over — 
except one woman carrying a baby, 
who stopped, kicked him carefully 
in face, then went down ramp. He 
may have been dead already, didn’t 
wait to see. Understand body stayed 
there till relief arrived. 

Next day was a half squad in 
that spot. Capsule for Novylen left 
empty. 

I t settled down. Those who had to 
travel got passports, die-hards 
quit traveling. Guard at a tube gate 
became two men, one looked at 
passports while other stood back 
with gun drawn. One who checked 
passports did not try hard, which 
was well as most were counter- 
feit and early ones were crude. But 
before long authentic paper was 
stolen and counterfeits were as. 
dinkum as official ones. More ex-

pensive but Loonies preferred free- 
enterprise passports. 

Our organization did not make 
counterfeits. We merely encouraged 
it — and knew who had them and 
’who did not; Mike’s records listed 
officially-issued ones. They helped 
separate sheep from goats in files 
we were building — also stored in 
iMike but in “Bastille” location — 
as we figured a man with coun- 
terfeit passport was halfway to join- 
ing us. Word was passed down cells 
in our growing organization never 
to recruit anybody with a valid 
passport. If recruiter was not cer- 
tain, just query upwards and answer 
came back. 

But guards’ troubles were not 
over. Does not help a guard’s dig- 
nity nor add to peace of mind to 
have children stand in front of him, 
or behind out of eye which was 
worse, and ape every move he 
makes — or run back and forth 
screaming obscenities, jeering, mak- 
ing finger motions that are univer- 
sal. At least guards took them as 
insults. 

One guard back-handed a small 
boy, cost him some teeth. Result: 
two guards dead, one Loonie dead. 

After that guards ignored chil- 
dren. 

We didn’t have to work this up; 
we merely encouraged it. You 
wouldn’t think a sweet old lady like 
my senior wife would encourage 
children to misbehave. But she did. 

Other things get single men a 
long way from home upset — and 
one we did start. These Peace Dra- 
goons had been sent to The Rock 
without a comfort detachment. 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


Some of our ferns were extreme- 
ly beautiful and some started loit- 
ering around stations, dressed in 
less than usual — which could ap- 
proach zero — and wearing more 
than usual amount of perfume, 
scents with range and striking pow- 
er. They did not speak to yellow 
jackets nor look at them; they 
simply crossed their line of sight, 
undulating as only a Loonie gal 
can. (A female on Terra can’t 
walk that way; she’s tied down by 
six times too much weight.) 

Such of course produces a male 
gallery, from men down to lads not 
yet pubescent — happy whistles and 
cheers for her beauty, narsty laughs 
at yellow boy. First girls to take this 
duty were slot-machine types but 
volunteers sprang up so fast that 
Prof decided we need not spend 
money. He was correct. Even Lud- 
milla, shy as a kitten, wanted to try 
it and did not only because Mum 
told her not to. But Lenore, ten 
years older and prettiest of our 
family, did try it and Mum did not 
scold. She came back pink and ex- 
cited and pleased with herself and 
anxious to tease enemy again. Her 
own idea; Lenore did not then know 
that revolution was brewing. 

During this time I rarely saw 
Prof and never in public; we kept 
in touch by phone. At first a bottle- 
neck was that our farm had just one 
phone for twenty-five people, many 
of them youngsters who would tie 
up a phone for hours unless coerced. 
Mimi was strict; our kids were al- 
lowed one out-going call per day 
and a max of ninety seconds on a 
call, with rising scale of punishment 

71 



— tempered by her warmth in grant- 
ing exceptions. But grants were ac- 
companied by “Mum’s Phone Lec- 
ture:” “When I first came to Luna 
there were no private phones. You 
children don’t know how soft — ” 

We were one of last prosperous 
families to install a phone; it was 
new in household when I was opted. 
We were prosperous because we 
never bought anything farm could 
produce. Mum disliked phone be- 
cause rates to Luna City Coop 
Comm Company were passed on in 
large measure to Authority. She 
never could understand why I could 
not (“Since you know all about 
such tilings, Manuel dear”) steal 
phone service as easily as we lib- 
erated power. That a phone instru- 
ment was part of a switching sys- 
tem into which it must fit was no 
interest to her. 

S teal it I did, eventually. Problem 
with illicit phone is how to re-' 
ceive incoming calls. Since phone is 
not listed, even if you tell persons 
from whom you want calls, switch- 
ing system itself does not have you 
listed; is no signal that can tell it to 
connect other party with you. 

Once Mike joined conspiracy, 
switching was no problem. 

I had in workshop most of what 
I needed; bought some items and 
liberated others. Drilled a tiny hole 
from workshop to phone cupboard 
and another to Wyoh’s room — virgin 
rock a meter thick but a laser drill 
collimated to a thin pencil cuts rap- 
idly. I unshipped listed phone, made 
a wireless coupling to line in its 
recess and concealed it. AH else 


needed were binaural receptors and 
a speaker in Wyoh’s room, con- 
cealed, and same in mine, and a cir- 
cuit to raise frequency above audio 
to have silence on Davis phone line, 
and its converse to restore audio in- 
coming. 

Only problem was to do this with- 
out being seen, and Mum generaled 
that 

All else was Mike’s problem. Used 
no switching arrangements; from 
then on used MYCROFTXXX only 
when calling from some other 
phone. Mike listened at all times in 
workshop and in Wyoh’s room; if he 
heard my voice or hers say “Mike,” 
he answered, but not to other voices. 
Voice patterns were as distinctive to 
him as fingerprints; he never made 
mistakes. 

Minor flourishes — soundproofing 
Wyoh’s door such as workshop door 
already had, switching to suppress 
my instrument or hers, signals to 
tell me she was alone in her room 
and door locked, and vice versa. All 
added , up to safe means whereby 
Wyoh and I could talk with Mike 
or with each other, or could set up 
talk-talk of Mike, Wyoh, Prof and 
self. Mike would call Prof wherever 
he was; Prof would talk or call 
back from a more private phone. 
Or might be Wyoh or myself had to 
be found. We all were careful to 
stay checked in with Mike. 

My bootleg phone, though it had 
no way to punch a call, could be 
used to call any number in Luna. 
Speak to Mike, ask for a Sherlock 
to anybody. Not tell him number; 
Mike had all listings and could look 
up a number faster than I could. 


72 


IF 






We were beginning to see unlim- 
ited possibilities in a phone-switch- 
ing system alive and on our side. I 
got from Mike and gave Mum still 
another null number to call Mike if 
she needed to reach me. She grew 
chummy with Mike while continuing 
to think he was a man. This spread 
through our family. One day as I 
returned home Sidris said, “Mannie 
darling, your friend with the nice 
voice called. Mike Holmes. Wants 
you to call back.” 

“Thanks, hon. Will.” 

“When are you going to invite 
him to dinner, Man? I think he’s 
nice.” 

I told her Gospodin Holmes had 
bad breath, was covered with rank 
hair, and hated women. 

She used a rude word. Mum not 
being in earshot. “You’re afraid to 
let me see him. Afraid I’ll opt out 
for him.” I patted her and told her 
that was why. I told Mike and Prof 
about it. 

Mike flirted even more with my 
womenfolk after that. 

XVI 

I began to learn techniques of con- 
spiracy and to appreciate Profs 
feeling that revolution could be an 
art. Did not forget (nor even doubt) 
Mike’s prediction that Luna was 
only seven years from disaster. But 
did not think about it, thought 
about fascinating, finicky details. 

Prof had emphasized that stick- 
iest problems in conspiracy are com- 
munications and security, and had 
pointed out that they conflict. Eas- 
ier communications are, greater is 


risk to security; if security is tight, 
organization can be paralyzed by 
safety precautions. He had explained 
that cell system was a compromise. 

I accepted cell system since was 
necessary to limit losses from spies. 
Even Wyoh admitted that organiza- 
tion without compartmentation 
could not work after she learned 
how rotten with spies old under- 
ground had been. 

But I did not like clogged com- 
munications or cell system. Like 
Terran dinosaurs of old, took too 
long to send message from head to 
tail, or back. So talked with Mike. 

We discarded many-linked chan- 
nels I had suggested to Prof. We re- 
tained cells but based security and 
communication on marvelous pos- 
sibilities of our dinkum thinkum. 
Communications: We set up a 
ternary tree of “party” names: 
Chairman, Gospodin Adam Sel- 
ene (Mike) 

Executive cell: Bork (me), Betty 
(Wyoh), Bill (Prof) 

Bork’s cell: Cassie (Mum), Colin, 
Chang 

Betty’s cell: Calvin (Greg), Ce- 
cilia (Sidris), Clayton 
Bill’s cell: Cornwall (Finn Niel- 
sen), Carolyn, Cotter 
— and so on. At seventh link 
George supervises Herbert, Henry, 
and Hallie. By time you reach that 
level you need 2,187 names with 
“H” — but turn it over to savvy com- 
puter who finds or invents them. 
Each recruit is given a party name 
and an emergency phone number. 
This number, instead of chasing 
through many links, connects with 
“Adam Selene,” Mike. 


74 


IP 


Security: Based on double prin- 
ciple; no human being can be trust- 
ed with anything — but Mike could 
be trusted with everything. 

Grim first half is beyond dis- 
pute. With drugs and other un- 
savory methods any man can be 
broken. Only defense is suicide, 
which may be impossible. Oh, are 
“hollow tooth” methods, classic and 
novel, some nearly infallible. Prof 
saw to it that Wyoh and myself 
were equipped. Never knew what he 
gave her as a final friend and since 
I never had to use mine, is no point 
in messy details. Nor am I sure I 
would ever suicide; am not stuff of 
martyrs. 

But Mike could never need to 
suicide, could not be drugged, did 
not feel pain. He carried everything 
concerning us in a separate memory 
bank under a locked signal pro- 
grammed only to our three voices, 
and, since flesh is weak, we added a 
signal under which any of us could 
lock out other two in emergency. 
In my opinion as best computerman 
in Luna, Mike could not remove this 
lock once it was set up. Best of all, 
nobody would ask master computer 
for this file because nobody new it 
existed, did not suspect Mike-as- 
Mike existed. How secure can you 
be? 

Only risk was that this awakened 
machine was whimsical. Mike was 
always showing unforeseen poten- 
tials. Conceivable he could figure 
way to get around block — if he 
wanted to. 

But would never want to. He was 
loyal to me, first and oldest friend; 
he liked Prof; I think he loved 


Wyoh. No. no, sex meant nothing. 
But Wyoh is loveable and they hit 
it off from start. 

I trusted Mike. In this life you 
have to bet. On that bet I would 
give any odds. 

S o we based security on trusting 
Mike with everything while each 
of us knew only what he had to 
know. Take that tree of names and 
numbers. I knew only party names 
of my cellmates and of three di- 
rectly under me. Was all I needed. 
Mike set up party names, assigned 
phone number to each, kept roster 
of real names versus party names. 
Let’s say party member “Daniel” 
(whom I would not know, being a 
“D” two levels below me) recruits 
Fritz Schultz. Daniel reports fact 
but not name upwards; “Adam Se- 
lene” calls Daniel, assigns for 
Schultz party name “Embrook,” 
then phones Schultz at number re- 
ceived from Daniel, gives Schultz 
his name “Embrook” and emergen- 
cv phone number, this number being 
different for each recruit. 

Not even “Embrook’s” cell leader 
would know “Embrook’s” emergen- 
cy number. What you do not know 
you cannot spill, not under drugs, 
nor torture, nor anything. Not even 
from carelessness. 

Now let’s suppose I need to reach 
Comrade Embrook. 

I don’t know who he is. He may 
live in Hong Kong or be shopkeeper 
nearest my home. Instead of passing 
message down, hoping it will reach 
him, I call Mike. Mike connects me 
with Embrook at once, in a “Sher- 
lock,” without giving me number. 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

Or suppose I need to speak to 
comrade who is preparing cartoon 
we are about to distribute in every 
taproom in Luna. I don’t know who 
he is. But I need to talk to him. 

I call Mike; Mike knows every- 
thing — and again I am quickly con- 
nected — and this comrade knows 
it’s okay as “Adam Selene” arranged 
call. “Comrade Bork speaking” — 
and he doesn’t know me but initial 
“B” tells him that I am vip indeed — 
“we have to change so-and-so. Tell 
your cell leader and have him check, 
but get on with it.” 

Minor flourishes — some comrades 
did not have phones; some could be 
reached only at certain hours; some 
outlying warrens did not have phone 
service. No matter, Mike knew ev- 
erything. And rest of us did not 
know anything that could endanger 
any but that handful whom each 
knew face to face. 

After we decided that Mike 
should talk voice-to-voice to any 
comrade under some circumstances, 
it was necessary to give him more 
voices and dress him up, make him 
three dimensions, create “Adam 
Selene, Chairman of the Provisional 
Committee of Free Luna.” 

Mike’s need for more voices lay 
in fact that he had just one voder- 
vocoder, whereas his brain could 
handle a dozen conversations, or a 
hundred (don’t know how many) — 
like a chess master playing fifty op- 
ponents, only more so. 

This would cause a bottleneck as 
organization grew and “Adam 
Selene” was phoned oftener, and 
could be crucial if we lasted long 
enough to go into action. 


Besides giving him more voices 
I wanted to silence one he had. One 
of those so-called computermen 
might walk into machines room 
while we were phoning Mike. Bound 
to cause even his dim wit to wonder 
if he found master machine appar- 
ently talking to itself. 

Voder-vocoder is very old device. 
Human voice is buzzes and hisses 
mixed various ways; true even of a 
coloratura soprano. A vocoder an- 
alyzes buzzes and hisses into pat- 
terns a computer (or trained eye) 
can read. A voder is a little box 
which can buzz and hiss and has 
controls to vary these elements to 
match those patterns. A human can 
“play” a voder, producing artificial 
speech; a properly programmed 
computer can do it as fast, as easily, 
as clearly as you can speak. 

But voices on a phone wire are 
not sound waves but electrical sig- 
nals; Mike did not need audio part 
of voder-vocoder to talk by phone. 
Sound waves were needed only by 
human at other end. No need for 
speech sounds inside Mike’s room at 
Authority Complex, so I planned to 
remove them, and thereby any dan- 
ger that somebody might notice. 

First I worked at home, using 
number-three arm most of time. Re- 
sult was very small box which sand- 
wiched twenty voder-vocoder cir- 
cuits minus audio side. Then I called 
Mike and told him to “get ill” in 
way that would annoy Warden. 
Then I waited. 

V r Je had done this “get ill” trick 
V before. I went back to work 
once we learned that I was clear,

which was Thursday that same week 
when Alvarez read into “Zebra” 
file an account of shambles at Stil- 
yagi Hall. His version listed about 
one hundred people (out of perhaps 
three hundred) ; list included 
Shorty Mkrum, Wyoh, Prof, and 
Finn Nielsen but not me. Apparent- 
ly I was missed by his finks. It told 
how nine police officers, each dep- 
utized by Warden to preserve peace, 
had been shot down in cold blood. 
Also named three of our dead. 

An add-on a week later stated that 
“the notorious agente provocateuse 
Wyoming Knott of Hong Kong in 
Luna, whose incendiary speech on 
Monday 13 May had incited the 
riot that cost the lives of nine brave 
officers, had not been apprehended 
in Luna City and had not returned 
to "her usual haunts in Hong Kong 
in Luna, and was now believed to 
have died in the massacre she her- 
self set off.” This add-on admitted 
what earlier report failed to men- 
tion, i.e., bodies were missing and 
exact number of dead was not 
known. 

This P.S. settled two things: 
Wyoh could not go home nor back 
to being a blonde. 

Since I had not been spotted I re- 
sumed my public ways. I took care 
of customers that week — bookkeep- 
ing machines and retrieval files at 
Carnegie Library — and spent time 
having Mike read out Zebra file 
and other special files, doing so in 
Room L of Raffles as I did not yet 
have my own phone. During that 
week Mike niggled at me like an im- 
patient child (which he was), want- 
ing to know when I was coming 


over to pick up more jokes. Failing 1 
that, he wanted to tell them by 
phone. 

I got annoyed and had to remind 
myself that from Mike’s viewpoint 
analyzing jokes was just as impor- 
tant as freeing Luna — and you don't 
break promises to a child. 

Besides that, I got itchy wonder- 
ing whether I could go inside Com- 
plex without being nabbed. We knew 
Prof was not clear, was sleeping in 
Raffles on that account. Yet they 
knew he had been at meeting and 
knew where he was, daily. But no 
attempt was made to pick him up. 
When we learned that attempt had 
been made to pick up Wyoh, I 
grew itchier. Was I clear? Or were 
they waiting to nab me quietly? Had 
to know. 

So I called Mike and told him to 
have a tummyache. He did so, I was 
called in — no trouble. Aside from 
showing passport at station, then to 
a new guard at Complex, all was 
usual. 

I chatted with Mike, picked up 
one thousand jokes (with under- 
standing that we would report a 
hundred at a time every three or 
four days, no faster), told him to 
get well, and went back to L-City, 
stopping on way out to bill Chief 
Engineer for working time, travel- 
and-tool time, materials, special 
service, anything I could load in. 

Thereafter saw Mike about once 
a month. Was safe, never went there 
except when they called me for mal- 
function beyond ability of their 
staff. I was always able to “repair” 
it, sometimes quickly, sometimes af- 
ter a full day and many tests. Was 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


77 



careful to leave tool marks on cover 
plates, and had before-and-after 
printouts of test runs to show what 
had been wrong, how I analyzed it, 
what I had done. Mike always 
worked perfectly after one of my 
visits; I was indispensable. 

S o, after I prepared his new voder- 
vocoder add-on, didn’t hesitate 
to tell him to get “ill.** 

Call came in thirty minutes. Mike 
had thought up a dandy; his “ill- 
ness” was wild oscillations in con- 
ditioning Warden’s Residence. He 
was running its heat up, then down, 
on an eleven-minute cycle, while 
oscillating its air pressure on a short 
cycle, ca. 2c/s, enough to make a 
man dreadfully nervy and perhaps 
cause earache. 

Conditioning a single residence 
should not go through a master 
computer! In Davis Tunnels we han- 
dled home and farm with idiot con- 
trols, feedbacks for each cubic with 
alarms so that somebody could 
climb out of bed and control by 
hand until trouble could be found. 
If cows got chilly, did not hurt 
corn; if lights failed over wheat, 
vegetables were okay. That Mike 
could raise hell with Warden’s res- 
idence and nobody could figure out 
what to do shows silliness of piling 
everything into one computer. 

Mike was happv-ioved. This was 
humor he really scanned. I enjoyed 
it. too. told him to go ahead, have 
fun — spread out tools, got out little 
black box. 

And computerman-of-the- watch 
comes banging and ringing at door. 
T took my time answering and car- 


ried number-five arm in right hand 
with short wing bare; this makes 
some people sick and upsets almost 
everybody. “What in hell do you 
want, choom?” I inquired. 

“Listen,” he says, “Warden is 
raising hell! Haven’t you found 
trouble?” 

“My compliments to Warden and 
tell him I will override by hand to 
restore his precious comfort as soon 
as I locate faulty circuit — if not 
slowed up by silly questions. Are 
you going to stand with door open 
blowing dust into machines while I 
have cover plates off? If you do — 
since you’re in charge — when dust 
puts machine on sputter, you can re- 
pair it. 7 won’t leave a warm bed to 
help. You can tell that to your 
bloody Warden, too.** 

“Watch your language, cobber.” 

“Watch yours, convict. Are you 
going to close that door? Or shall 
I walk out and go back to L-City?” 
And raised number-five like a club. 

He closed door. 

Had no interest in insulting . poor 
sod. Was one small bit of policy to 
make everybody as unhappy as pos- 
sible. He was finding working for 
Warden difficult; I wanted to make 
it unbearable. 

“Shall I step it up?” Mike in- 
quired. 

“Um, hold it so for ten minutes, 
then stop abruptly. Then jog it for 
an hour, say with air pressures. Er- 
ratic but bard. Know what a sonic 
boom is?” 

“Certainly. It is a — ” 

“Don’t define. After you drop 
major effect, rattle bis air ducts 
every few minutes with nearest to

IF 



a boom system will produce. Then 
give him something to remember. 
Mmm . Mike, can you make his 
W.C. run backwards?” 

“I surely can! All of them?” 

“How many does he have?” 
“Six.” 

“Well . program, to give them 
all a push, enough to soak his rugs. 
But if you can spot one nearest his 
bedroom, fountain it clear to ceil- 
ing. Can?” 

“Program set up!” 

“Good. Now for your present, 
ducky.” There was room in voder 
audio box to hide it and I spent 
forty minutes with number-three, 
getting it just so. We trial-checked 
through voder-vocoder, then I told 
him to call Wyoh and check each 
circuit. 

F or ten minutes was silence, 
which I spent putting tool 
marks on a cover plate which should 
have been removed had been any- 
thing wrong, putting tools away, put- 
ting number-six arm on, robing up 
one thousand jokes waiting in print- 
out. 

T had found no need to cut out 
audio of voder. Mike had thought 
of it before I had and always 
chopped off any time door was 
touched. Since his refexes were 
better than mine by a factor of at 
least a thousand, I forgot it. 

At last he said, “All twenty cir- 
cuits okay. I can switch circuits in 
the middle of a word and Wyoh 
can’t detect discontinuity. And I 
called Prof and said Hello and 
talked to Mum on your home phone, 
all three at the same time.” 


“We’re in business. What excuse 
you give Mum?” 

“I asked her to have you call me, 
Adam Selene that is. Then we chat- 
ted. She’s a charming conversation- 
alist. We discussed Greg’s sermon 
of last Tuesday.” 

“Huh? How?” 

“I told her I had listened to it, 
Man, and quoted a poetic part.” 
“Oh, Mike!” 

“It’s okay, Man. I let her think 
that I sat in back, then slipped out 
during the closing hymn. She’s not 
nosy. She knows that I don’t want 
to be seen.” 

Mum is nosiest female in Luna. 
“Guess it’s okay. But don’t do it 
again. Um — Do it again. You go to 
— you monitor — meetings and lec- 
tures and concerts and stuff.” 
“Unless some busybody switches 
me off by hand! Man, I can’t con- 
trol those spot pickups the way I do 
a phone.” 

“Too simple a switch. Brute 
muscle rather than solid-state flip- 
flop.” 

“That’s barbaric. And unfair.” 
“Mike, almost everything is un- 
fair. What can’t be cured — ” 

“—must be endured. That’s a 
funny-once, Man.” 

“Sorry. Let’s change it: What 
can’t be cured should be tossed out 
and something better put in. Which 
we’ll do. What chances last time 
yon calculated?” 

“Approximately one in nine, 
Man.” * 

“Getting worse?” 

“Man, they’ll get worse for 

months. We haven’t reached the

well. Back to other matters. From 
bow on, when you talk to anyone,

ever, you were there, too — and

“Yes. Shan I read it back?”

pernel, our John Galt, our Swamp 
Fox, our man of mystery. You go 
everywhere, know everything, slip 
in and out of town without pass- 
port. You’re always there, yet no- 
body catches sight of you.” 

H is lights rippled, he gave a sub- 
dued chuckle. “That’s fun, 
Man. Funny once, funny twice, 
maybe funny always.” 

■“Funny always. How long ago 
did you stop gymkhana at War- 
den’s?” 

“Forty-three minutes ago except 
erratic booms.” 

“Bet his teeth ache! Give him fif- 
teen minutes more. Then I’ll re- 
port job completed.” 

“Noted. Wyoh sent you a mes- 
sage, Man. She said to remind you 
of Billy’s birthday party.” 

“Oh, my word! Stop everything, 
I’m leaving. ’Bye!” I hurried out. 
Billy’s^ mother is Anna. Probably 
her last — and right well she’s done 
by us, eight kids, three still home. I 
try to be as careful as Mum never 
to show favoritism . but Billy is 
quite a boy and I taught him to 
read. Possible he looks like me. 

Stopped at Chief Engineer’s office 
to leave bill and demanded to see 

80 


him. Was let in and he was in bel- 
ligerent mood; Warden had bees 
riding him, “Hold it,” I told him. 
“My son’s birthday and shan’t be 
late. But must show you some- 
thing.” 

Took an envelope from kit, 
dumped item on desk: corpse ,of 
house fly which I had charred with 
a hot wire and fetched. We do not 
tolerate flies in Davis Tunnels but 
sometimes one wanders in from 
city as locks are opened. This wound 
up in my workshop just when I 
needed it. “See that? Guess where 
I found ft.” 

On that faked evidence I built a 
lecture on care of fine machines, 
talked about doors opened, com- 
plained about man on watch. 
“Dust can ruin a computer. Insects 
are unpardonable! Yet your watch- 
standers wander in and out as if 
tube station. Today both doors held 
open — while this idiot yammered. If 
I find more evidence that cover 
plates have been removed by hoof- 
handed choom who attracts flies — 
well, it’s your plant, Chief. Got more 
than I can handle, been doing your 
chores because I like fine machines. 
Can’t stand to see them abused! 
Good-by.” 

“Hold on. I want to tell you 
something.” 

“Sorry, got to go. Take it or 
leave it. I’m no vermin extermin- 
ator; I’m a computerman.” 

Nothing frustrates a man so much 
as not letting him get in his say. 
With luck and help from Warden, 
Chief Engineer would have ulcers 
by Christmas. 

Was late anyhow and made 

IF 



humble apology to Billy. Alvarez 
had thought up new wrinkle, close 
search on leaving Complex. I en- 
dured it with never a narsty word 
for Dragoons who searched me; 
wanted to get home. But those 
thousand jokes bothered them. 
“What’s this?” one demanded. 

'“Computer paper,” I said. “Test 
runs.” 

His mate joined him. Don’t think 
they could read. They wanted to 
confiscate, so I demanded they call 
Chief Engineer. They let me go. 

I left not displeased; more and 
more such, and guards were daily 
more hated. 

XVII 

D ecision to make Mike more a 
person arose from need to have 
any Party member phone him on 
occasion. My advice about concerts 
and plays was simply a side effect. 

Mike’s voice over phone had odd 
quality I had not noticed during 
time I had visited him only at Com- 
plex. When you speak to a man by 
phone there is background noise. 
And you hear him breathe, hear 
heartbeats, body motions even 
though rarely conscious of these. 
Besides that, even if he speaks un- 
der a hush hood, noises get through, 
enough to “fill space,” make him a 
body with surroundings. 

With Mike was none of this. 

By then Mike’s voice was “hu- 
man” in timbre and quality, recog- 
nizable. He was baritone, had North 
American accent with Aussie over- 
tones. As “Michele” he (she?) had 
a light soprano with French flavor. 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


Mike’s personality grew also. When 
first I introduced Mm to Wyeih and 
Prof he sounded like a pedantic 
child. In short weeks he flowered 
until I visualized a man about own 
age. 

His voice when be first woke was 
blurred and harsh, hardly under- 
standable. Now it was clear and 
choice of words mid phrasing was 
consistent — colloquial to me, schol- 
arly to Prof, gallant to Wyoh, var- 
iation one expects of matins adult 

But background was dead. Thick 
silence. 

So we filled it. Mike needed only 
hints. He did not make Ms breath- 
ing noisy, ordinarily you would not 
notice. But he would stick in touch- 
es. '“Sorry, Mannie, you caught me 
bathing when the phone sounded” 
— and let one hear hurried breath- 
ing. Or “I was eating — had to swal- 
low.” He used such even on me, 
once he undertook to “be a hu- 
man body.” 

We all put “Adam Selene” to- 
gether, talking it over at Raffles. 
How old was he? What did he look 
like? Married? Where did he live? 
What work? What interests? 

We decided that Adam was about 
forty, healthy, vigorous, well edu- 
cated, interested in all arts and 
sciences and very well grounded in 
history, a match chess player but 
little time to play. He was married 
in commonest type, a troika in 
which he was senior husband — four 
children. Wife and junior husband 
not in politics, so far as we knew. 

He was ruggedly handsome with 
wavy iron-gray hair and was mixed 
race, second generation one side, 

•1 



third on other. Was wealthy by 
Loonie standards, with interests in 
Novylen and Kongville as well as 
L-City. He kept offices in Luna 
City, outer office with a dozen 
people plus private office staffed by 
male deputy and female secretary. 

Wyoh wanted to know was he 
bundling with secretary? I told her 
to switch off, was private. Wyoh 
said indignantly that she was not 
being snoopy — weren’t we trying 
to create a rounded character? 

We decided that offices- were in 
Old Dome, third ramp, south side, 
heart of financial district. If you 
know L-City, you recall that in Old 
Dome some offices have windows 
since they can look out over floor 
of Dome. I wanted this for sound 
effects. 

We drew a floor plan and had 
that office existed, it would have 
been between Aetna Luna and 
Greenberg & Co. I used pouch re- 
corder to pick up sounds at spot; 
Mike added to it by listening at 
phones there. 

Thereafter when you called “Ad- 
am Selene” background was not 
dead. If “Ursula”, his secretary, 
took call, it was: “Selene Associ- 
ates. Luna shall be free!” Then she 
might say, “Will you hold? Gospo- 
din Selene is on another call” 
whereupon you might hear sound 
of W.C., followed by running water 
and know that she had told little 
white lie. Or Adam might answer: 
“Adam Selene here. Free Luna. One 
second while I shut off the video.” 
Or deputy might answer: “This is 
Albert Ginwallah, Adam Selene’s 
confidential assistant. Free Luna. If 


it’s a Party matter — as I assume it 
is; that was your Party name you 
gave — please don’t hesitate; I han- 
dle such things for the Chairman.” 

Last was a trap, as every com- 
rade was instructed to speak only to 
Adam Selene. No attempt was made 
to discipline one who took bait; in- 
stead his cell captain was warned 
that this comrade must not be trust- 
ed with anything vital. 

We got echoes. “Free Luna!” or 
“Luna shall be free!” took hold 
among youngsters, then among solid 
citizens. 

First time I heard it in a busi- 
ness call I almost swallowed teeth. 
Then called Mike and asked if 
this person was Party member? 
Was not. So I recommended that 
Mike trace down Party tree and 
see if somebody could recruit him. 

M ost interesting echo was in 
“File Zebra.” “Adam Selene” 
appeared in boss fink’s security 
file less than a lunar after we cre- 
ated him, with notation that this 
was a cover name for a leader in 
a new underground. 

Alvarez’s spies did a job on “Ad- 
am Selene.” Over course of months 
his File Zebra dossier built up: 
Male, 35-45, offices south face of 
Old Dome, usually there 0900-1800 
Gr. except Saturday but calls are 
relayed at other hours, home inside 
urban pressure as travel time never 
exceeds seventeen minutes. Children 
in household. Activities include 
stock brokerage, farming interests. 
Attends theater, concerts, etc. Prob- 
ably member Luna City Chess Club 
and Luna Assoc. d’Echecs. Plays

ricochet and other heavy sports 
lunch hour, probably Luna City 
Athletic Club. Gourmet but watch- 
es weight. Remarkable memory plus 
mathematical ability. Executive type, 
able to reach decisions quickly. 

One fink was convinced that he 
had talked to Adam between acts 
at revival of Hamlet by Civic Play- 
ers. Alvarez noted description — 
matched our picture all but wavy 
hair! 

But thing that drove Alvarez 
crackers was that phone numbers for 
Adam were reported and every time 
they turned out wrong numbers. 
(Not nulls; we had run out and 
Mike was using any number not in 
use and switching numbers any 
time new subscribers were assigned 
ones we had been using.) Alvarez 
tried to trace “Selene Associates” 
using a one-wrong-digit assumption. 
This we learned because Mike was 
keeping an ear on Alvarez’s office 
phone and heard order. Mike used 
knowledge to play a Mikish prank: 
Subordinate who made one-changed- 
digit calls invariably reached War- 
den’s private residence. So Alvarez 
was called in and chewed by War- 
den. 

Couldn’t scold Mike but did warn 
him it would alert any smart per- 
son to fact that somebody was play- 
ing tricks with computer. Mike an- 
swered that they were not that 
smart. 

Main result of Alvarez’s efforts 
was that each time he got a number 
for Adam we located a spy — a 
new spy, as those we had spotted 
earlier were never given phone num- 
bers; instead they were recruited 


into a tail-chasing organization 
where they could inform on each 
other. But with Alvarez’s help we 
spotted each new spy almost at once. 
I think Alvarez became unhappy 
over spies he was able to hire. Two 
disappeared and our organization, 
then over six thousand, was never 
able to find them. Eliminated, I 
suppose. Or died under question- 
ing. 

“Selene Associates” was not only 
phony company we set up. LuNo- 
HoCo was much largo*, just as 
phony, and not at all dummy. It had 
main offices in Hong Kong, branch- 
es in Novy Leningrad and Luna 
City, eventually employed hundreds 
of people most of whom woe not 
Party members and was our most 
difficult operation. 

Mike’s master plan listed a weary 
number of problems which had to 
be solved. One was finance. An- 
other was how to protect catapult 
from space attack. 

Prof considered robbing banks to 
solve first, gave it up reluctantly. 
But eventually we did rob banks, 
firms and Authority itself. Mike 
thought of it, Mike and Prof work- 
ed it out. At first was not clear to 
Mike why we needed money. He 
knew as little about pressure that 
keeps humans scratching as he knew 
about sex; Mike handled millions of 
dollars and could not see any prob- 
lem. He started by offering to issue 
an Authority cheque for whatever 
dollars we wanted. 

Prof shied in horror. He then 
explained to Mike hazard in trying 
to cash a cheque for, let me say, 
AS$ 10,000,000 drawn on Authority. 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


83 



S o they imdertook to do it, but re- 
tail, in many names and places 
all over Luna. Every bank, firm, 
shop, agency including Authority, 
for which Mike did accounting, was 
tapped for Party funds. Was a pyr- 
amided swindle based on fact, un- 
known to me but known to Prof and 
latent in Mike’s immense knowledge, 
that most money is simply book- 
keeping. 

Example — multiply by hundreds 
of many types: My family son Ser- 
gei, eighteen and a Party member, 
is asked to start account at Com- 
monwealth Shared Risk. He makes 
deposits and withdrawals. Small er- 
rors are made each time; he is 
credited with more than he deposits, 
is debited with less than he with- 
draws. 

A few months later he takes job 
out of town and transfers account to 
Tycho-Under Mutual; transferred 
funds are three times already-inflat- 
ed amount. Most of this he soon 
draws out in cash and passes to his 
cell leader. Mike knows amount Ser- 
gei shookl hand over, but (since 
they do not know that Adam Selene 
and bank’s computer-bookkeeper are 
one and same) they have each been 
instructed to report transaction to 
Adam — keep them honest though 
scheme was not. 

Multiply this theft of about HK- 
$3000 by hundreds somewhat like it. 

I can’t describe jiggery-pokery 
Mike used to balance his books 
while keeping thousands of thefts 
from showing. But bear in mind that 
an auditor must assume that ma- 
chines are honest. He will make test 
runs to check that machines are 


working correctly — but will not oc- 
cur to him that tests prove nothing 
because machine itself is dishonest. 

Mike’s thefts were never large 
enough to disturb economy. Like 
half -liter of blood, amount was too 
small to hurt donor. I can’t make up 
mind who lost, money was swapped 
around so many ways. But scheme 
troubled me; I was brought up to 
be honest, except with Authority. 
Prof claimed that what was taking 
place was a mild inflation offset by 
fact that we plowed money back in 
— but I should remember that Mike 
had records and all could be re- 
stored after Revolution, with ease 
since we would no longer be bled 
in much larger amounts by Author- 
ity. 

I told conscience to go to sleep. 
Was pipsqueak compared to swindles 
by every government throughout his- 
tory in financing every war. And is 
not revolution a war? 

This money, after passing through 
many hands (augmented by Mike 
each time), wound up as senior 
financing of LuNoHo Company. 
Was a mixed company, mutual and 
stock; “gentleman-adventurer” guar- 
antors who backed stock put up that 
stolen money in own names. Won’t 
discuss bookkeeping this firm used. 
Since Mike ran everything, was not 
corrupted by any tinge of honesty. 

Nevertheless its shares were trad- 
ed in Hong Kong Luna Exchange 
and listed in Zurich, London and 
New York. Wall Street Journal call- 
ed it “an attractive high-risk-high- 
gain investment with novel growth 
potential.” 

LuNoHoCo was an engineering 



and exploitation firm, engaged in 
many ventures, mostly * legitimate. 
But prime purpose was to build a 
second catapult, secretly. 

Operation could not be secret. 
You can’t buy or build a hydrogen- 
fusion power plant for such and not 
have it noticed. (Sunpower was re- 
jected for obvious reasons.) Parts 
were ordered from Pittsburgh, stand- 
ard UnivCalif equipment, and we 
happily paid their royalties to get 
top quality. Can’t build a stator for a 
kilometers-long induction field with- 
out having it noticed, either. But 
most important you cannot do major 
construction hiring many people and 
not have it show. Sure, catapults are 
mostly vacuum; stator rings aren’t 
even close together at ejection end 
But Authority’s 3-G catapult was al- 
most one hundred kilometers long. 
It was not only an astrogation land- 
mark, on every Luna-jump chart, 
but was so big it could be photo- 
graphed or seen by eye from Terra 
with not-large telescope. It showed 
up beautifully on a radar screen 
We were building a catapult, a 
10-g job, but even that was thirty 
kilometers long, too big to hide. 

So we hid it by “Purloined Let- 
ter” method. 

I used to question Mike’s endless 
reading of fiction, wondering 
what notions he was getting. But 
turned out he got a better feeling 
for human life from stories than he 
had been able to garner from facts. 
Fiction gave him a gestalt of life, 
one taken for granted by a human; 
he lives it. Besides this “humaniz- 
ing” effect, Mike’s substitute for 


experience, he got ideas from “not- 
true data” as he called fiction. How 
to hide a catapult he got from Ed- 
gar Allan Poe. 

We hid it in literal sense, too; 
this catapult had to be underground, 
so that it would not show to eye or 
radar. But had to be hidden in more 
subtle sense. Selenographic location 
had to be secret. 

How can this be, with a monster 
that big, worked on by so many peo- 
ple? Put it this way: Suppose you 
live in Novylen; know where Luna 
City is? Why, on east edge of Mare 
Crisium; everybody knows that. So? 
What latitude and longitude? Huh? 
Look it up in reference book! So? 
If you don’t know where any better 
that that, how did you find it last 
week? No huhu, cobber; I took tube, 
changed at Torricelli, slept rest of 
way; finding it was capsule’s worry 

See? You don't know where Luna 
City is! You simply get out when 
capsule pulls in at Tube Station 
South. 

That’s how we hid catapult. 

Is in Mare Undarum area, “every- 
body knows that.” But where it is 
and where we said it was differ by 
amount greater or less than one 
hundred kilometers in direction 
north, south, east or west, or some 
combination. 

Today you can look up its loca- 
tion in reference books — and find 
same wrong answer. Location of 
that catapult is still most closelv 
guarded secret in Luna. 

Can’t be seen from space, by eye 
or radar. Is underground save for 
ejection and that is a big black 
shapeless hole like ten thousand 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

others and high up an uninviting 
mountain with no place for a jump 
rocket to put down. 

Nevertheless many 'people were 
there, during and after construc- 
tion. Even Warden visited and my 
co-husband Greg showed him 
around. Warden went by mail rock- 
et, commandeered for day, and his 
Cyborg was given coordinates and 
a radar beacon to home on — a spot 
in fact not far from site. But from 
there, was necessary to travel by 
rolligon. And our lorries were not 
like passenger buses from Endsville 
to Beluthihatchie in old days; they 
were cargo carriers, no ports for 
sightseeing and a ride so rough that 
human cargo had to be strapped 
down. Warden wanted to ride up in 
cab but — sorry Gospodin! — just 
space for wrangler and his helper 
and took both to keep her steady. 

Three hours later he did not care 
about anything but getting home. He 
stayed one hour and was not inter- 
ested in talk about purpose of all 
this drilling and values of resources 
uncovered. 

T ess important people, workmen 

i and others, traveled by inter- 
connecting ice-exploration boxes, 
st ; u easier way to get lost. If any- 
body carried an inertial pathfinder 
in his luggage, he could have located 
site — but security was tight. One 
did so and had accident with p-suit. 
His effects were returned to L-City 
and his pathfinder read what it 
should — i.e., what we wanted it to 
read, for I made hurried trip out 
with number-three arm along. You 
can reseal one without a trace if 


you do it in nitrogen atmosphere. I 
wore an oxygen mask at slight over- 
pressure. No huhu. 

We entertained vips from Earth, 
some high in Authority. They trav- 
eled easier underground route; I 
suppose Warden had warned them. 
But even on that route is one thirty- 
kilometer stretch by rolligon. We 
had one visitor from Earth who 
looked like trouble, a Dr. Dorian, 
physicist and engineer. 

Lorry tipped over. Silly driver 
tried shortcut. They were not in line- 
of-sight for anything and their bea- 
con was smashed. Poor Dr. Dorian 
spent seventy-two hours in an un- 
sealed pumice igloo and had to be 
returned to L-City ill from hypoxia 
and overdose of radiation despite 
efforts on his behalf by two Party 
members driving him. 

Might have been safe to let him 
see. He might not have spotted dou- 
bletalk and would not have spotted 
error in location. Few people look 
at stars when p-suited even when 
Sun doesn’t make it futile. Still few- 
er can read stars — and nobody can 
locate himself on surface without 
help unless he has instruments, 
knows how to use them and has 
tables and something to give a time 
kick. Put at crudest level, minimum 
would be octant, tables, and good 
watch. 

Our visitors were even encour- 
aged to go out on surface. But if 
one had carried an octant or modern 
equivalent, might have had accident. 

We did not make accidents for 
spies. We let them stay, worked 
them hard, and Mike read their re- 
ports. One reported that he was 


86 


IF 



certain that we had found uranium 
ore, something unknown in Luna at 
that time, Project Centerbore being 
many years later. Next spy came 
out with kit of radiation counters. 
We made it easy for him to sneak 
them through bore. 

By March ’76 catapult was almost 
ready, lacking only installation of 
stator segments. Power plant was in 
and a co-ax had been strung under- 
ground with a line-of-sight link for 
that thirty kilometers. Crew was 
down to skeleton size, mostly Party 
members. But we kept one spy so 
that Alvarez could have regular re- 
ports — didn’t want him to worry; 
it tended to make him suspicious. In- 
stead we worried him in warrens. 

XVIII 

W ere changes in those eleven 
months. Wyoh was baptized 
into Greg’s church, Profs health be- 
came so shaky that he dropped 
teaching, Mike took up writing poet- 
ry. Yankees finished in cellar. 

Wouldn’t have minded paying 
Prof if they had been nosed out, but 
from pennant to cellar in one sea- 
son — I quit watching them on vi- 
deo. 

Profs illness was phony. He was 
in perfect shape for age, exercising 
in hotel room three hours each day, 
and sleeping in three hundred kilo- 
grams of lead pajamas. And so was 
I. And so was Wyoh, who hated it. 

I don’t think she ever cheated and 
spent night in comfort though can’t 
say for sure; I was not dossing with 
her. She had become a fixture in 
Davis family. Took her one day to 


go from “Gospozha Davis” to “Gos- 
pozha Mum,” one more to reach 
“Mum” and now it might be “Mimi 
Mum” with arm around Mum’s 
waist. When Zebra File showed she 
couldn’t go back to Hong Kong, Sid- 
ris had taken Wyoh into her beauty 
shop after hours and done a job 
which left skin same dark shade but 
would not scrub off. Sidris also did 
a hairdo on Wyoh that left it black 
and looking as if unsuccessfully 
unkinked. Plus minor touches — 
opaque nail enamel, plastic inserts 
for cheeks and nostrils and of course 
she wore her dark-eyed contact 
lenses. When Sidris got through, 
Wyoh could have gone bundling 
without fretting about her disguise; 
was a perfect “colored” with ances- 
try to match — Tamil, a touch of 
Angola, German. I called her “Wy- 
ma” rather than “Wyoh”. 

She was gorgeous. When she un- 
dulated down a corridor, boys fol- 
lowed in swarms. 

She started to learn farming from 
Greg but Mum put stop to that. 
While she was big and smart and 
willing, our farm is mostly a male 
operation. Greg and Hans were not 
only male members of our family 
distracted; she cost more farming 
man-hours than her industry equal- 
ed. So Wyoh went back to house- 
work, then Sidris took her into 
beauty shop as helper. 

Prof played ponies with two ac- 
counts, betting one by Mike’s “lead- 
ing apprentice” system, other by his 
own “scientific” system. By July ’75 
he admitted that he knew nothing 
about horses and went solely to 
Mike’s system, increasing bets and 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


87 



spreading them among many book- 
ies. 

His winnings paid Party’s ex- 
penses while Mike built swindle that 
financed catapult. But Prof lost in- 
terest in a sure thing and merely 
placed bets as Mike designated. He 
stopped reading pony journals. Sad. 
Something dies when an old horse- 
player quits. 

Ludmilla had a girl which they 
say is lucky in a first and which 
delighted me — every family needs a 
girl baby. Wyoh surprised our wom- 
en by being expert in midwifery — 
and surprised them again that she 
knew nothing about baby care. Our 
two oldest sons found marriages at 
last and Teddy, thirteen, was opted 
out. Greg hired two lads from neigh- 
bor farms and, after six months of 
working and eating with us, both 
were opted in — not rushing things, 
we had known them and their fam- 
ilies for years. It restored balance 
we had lacked since Ludmilla’s opt- 
ing and put stop to snide remarks 
from mothers of bachelors who had 
not found marriages Not that Mum 
wasn’t capable of snubbing anyone 
she did not consider up to Davis 
standards. 

Wyoh recruited Sidris; Sidris 
started her own cell by recruiting 
her other assistant and Bon Ton 
Beaute Shoppe became hotbed of 
subversion. We started using our 
smallest kids for deliveries and other 
jobs a child can do. They can stake- 
out or trail a person through corri- 
dors better than an adult, and are 
not suspected. Sidris grabbed this 
notion and expanded it through 
women recruited in beauty parlor. 

88 


S oon she had so many kids on tap 
_ that we could keep all of Al- 
varez’s spies under surveillance. With 
Mike able to listen at any phone 
and a child spotting it whenever a 
spy left home or place of work or 
wherever — with enough kids on call 
so that one could phone while an- 
other held down a new stake-out, 
we could keep a spy under tight 
observation and keep him from see- 
ing anything we didn’t want him to 
see. Shortly we were getting reports 
spies phoned in without waiting for 
Zebra File. It did a sod no good to 
phone from a taproom instead of 
home; with Baker Street Irregular* 
on job Mike was listening before he 
finished punching number. 

These kids located Alvarez’s dep- 
uty spy boss in L-City. We knew 
he had one because these finks did 
not report to Alvarez by phone, nor 
did it seem possible that Alvarez 
could have recruited them as none 
of them worked in Complex and Al- 
varez came inside Luna City only 
when an Earthside vip was so im- 
portant as to rate a bodyguard com- 
manded by Alvarez in person. 

His deputy turned out to be two 
people — an old lag who ran a 
candy, news and bookie counter in 
Old Dome and his son who was on 
civil service in Complex. Son car- 
ried reports in, so Mike had not 
been able to hear them. 

We let them alone. But from then 
on we had fink field reports half a 
day sooner than Alvarez. This ad- 
vantage — all due to kids as young 
as five or six — saved lives of seven 
comrades. A11 glory to Baker Street 
Irregulars!

Don’t remember who named them 
but think it was Mike. I was merely 
a Sherlock Holmes fan whereas he 
really did think he was Sherlock 
Holmes’ brother Mycroft . nor 
would I swear he was not; “reality” 
is a slippery notion. Kids did not 
call themselves that; they had their 
own play gangs with own names. 
Nor were they burdened with se- 
crets which could endanger them. 
Sidris left it to mothers to explain 
why they were being asked to do 
these jobs save that they were never 
to be told the real reason. Kids will 
do anything mysterious and fun; 
look how many of their games are 
based on out-smarting. 

Bon Ton salon was a clearing 
house of gossip — women get news 
faster than Daily Lunatic. I en- 
couraged Wyoh to report to Mike 
each night, not try to thin gossip 
down to what seemed significant 
because was no telling what might 
be significant once Mike got through 
associating it with other facts. 

Beauty parlor was also place to 
start rumors. Party had grown slow- 
ly at first, then rapidly as powers- 
of-three began to be felt and also 
because Peace Dragoons were nars- 
tier than older bodyguard. As num- 
bers increased we shifted to high 
speed on agitprop, black-propaganda 
rumors, open subversion, provoca- 
teur activities and sabotage. Finn 
Nielsen handled agitprop when it 
was simpler as well as dangerous 
job of continuing to front for and 
put cover-up activity into older, spy- 
ridden underground. But now a large 
chunk of agitprop and related work 
was given to Sidris. 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


Much involved distributing hand- 
bills and such. No subversive liter- 
ature was ever in her shop, nor our 
home, nor that hotel room. Distri- 
bution was done by kids, too young 
to read. 

Sidris was also working a full day 
bending hair and such. About time 
she began to have too much to do 
I happened one evening to make 
walk-about cal Causeway with Sidris 
on my arm when I caught sight of a 
familiar face and figure — skinny 
little girl, all angles, carrot-red hair. 
She was possibly twelve, at stage 
when a fern shoots up just before 
blossoming out into rounded soft- 
ness. I knew her but could not say 
why or when or where. 

I said, “Psst, doll baby. Eyeball 
young fern ahead. Orange hair, no 
cushions.” 

S idris looked her over. "Darling, 
I knew you were eccentric. But 
she’s still a boy.” 

“Damp it. Who?” 

“Bog knows. Shall I sprag her?” 
Suddenly I remembered like vi- 
deo coming on. And wished Wyoh 
were with me — but Wyoh and I 
were never together in public. This 
skinny redhead had been at meeting 
where Shorty was killed. She sat on 
floor against wall down front and' 
listened with wide-eyed seriousness 
and applauded fiercely. Then I had 
seen her at end in free trajectory — 
curled into ball in air and had hit a 
yellow jacket in knees, he whose jaw 
I broke a moment later. 

Wyoh and I were alive and free 
because this kid moved fast in a 
crisis. “No, don’t speak to her,” I

told Sidris. “But I want to keep her 
in sight Wish we had one of your 
Irregulars here. Damn.” 

“Drop off and phone Wyoh, 
you’ll Have one in f ive minutes,” my 
wife said. 

I did. Then Sidris and I strolled, 
looking in shop windows and mov- 
ing slowly, as quarry was window 
shopping. In seven or eight minutes 
a small boy came toward us, stopped 
and said, “Hello, Auntie Mabel! Hi, 
Uncle Joe.” 

Sidris took his hand. “Hi, Tony. 
How’s your mother, dear?” 

“Just fine.” He added in a whis- 
per, “I’m Jock.” 

“Sorry.” Sidris said quietly to me, 
“Stay on her,” and took Jock into 
a tuck shop. 

She came out and joined me. Jock 
followed her licking a lollipop. “’Bye, 
Auntie Mabel! Thanks!” He danced 
away, rotating, wound up by that 
little redhead, stood and stared into 
a display, solemnly sucking his 
sweet. Sidris and I went home. 

A report was waiting. “She went 
into Cradle Roll Creche and hasn’t 
come out. Do we stay on it?” 

“A bit yet,” I told Wyoh, and 
asked if she remembered this kid 
She did, but had no idea who she 
might be. “You could ask Finn.” 

“Can do better.” I called Mike. 

Yes, Cradle Roll Creche had a 
phone and Mike would listen Took 
him twenty minutes to pick up 
enough to give analysis. Manv voung 
voices and at such ages almost sex- 
less But presently he told me, 
“Man. I hear three voices that could 
match the age and physical type 
you described. However, two an- 


swer to names which I assume to be 
masculine. The third answers when 
anyone says ‘Hazel’ — which an old- 
er female voice does repeatedly. She 
seems to be Hazel’s boss.” 

“Mike, look at old organization 
file. Check Hazels.” 

“Four Hazels,” he answered at 
once, “and here she is: Hazel 

Meade, Young Comrades Auxiliary, 
address Cradle Roll Creche, born 
25 December 2063, mass thirty-nine 
kilos, height — ” 

“That’s our little jump jet! Thanks, 
Mike. Wyoh, call off stake-out. Good 
job!” 

“Mike, call Donna and pass the 
word, that’s a dear.” 

I left it to girls to recruit Hazel 
Meade and did not eyeball her until 
Sidris moved her into our household 
two weeks later. But Wyoh volun- 
teered a report before then; policy 
was involved. Sidris had filled her 
cell but wanted Hazel Meade. Be- 
sides this irregularity, Sidris was 
doubtful about recruiting a child. 
Policy was adults only, sixteen and 
up. 

I took it to “Adam Selene” and 
executive cell. “As I see.” I said, 
“this cells-of-three system is to serve 
us, not bind us. See nothing wrong 
in Comrade Cecilia having an extra. 
Nor any real danger to security.” 

“I agree,” said Prof. “But I sug- 
gest that the extra member not be 
part of Cecilia’s cell. She should 
not know the others. I mean, unless 
the duties Cecilia gives her makes it 
necessary. Nor do I think she should 
recruit, at her age. The real ques- 
tion is her age.” 


90 


IF 



“Agreed,” said Wyoh. “I want to 
talk about this kid’s age.” 

“Friends,” Mike said diffidently 
(diffidently first time in weeks; he 
was now that confident executive 
“Adam Selene” much more than 
lonely machine) — “perhaps I 
should have told you, but I have 
already granted similar variations. 
It did not seem to require dis- 
cussion.” 

“It doesn’t, Mike,” Prof reas- 
sured him. “A chairman must use 
his own judgment. What is our 
largest cell?” 

“Five. It is a double cell, three 
and two.” 

“No harm done. Dear Wyoh, does 
Sidris propose to make this child 
a full comrade? Let her know that 
we are committed to revolution 
. with all the bloodshed, dis- 
order and possible disaster that en- 
tails?” 

“That’s exactly what she is re- 
questing.” 

“But, dear lady, while we are 
staking our lives, we are told 
enough to know it. For that, one 
should have an emotional grasp of 
death. Children seldom are able 
to realize that death will come to 
them personally. One might de- 
fine adulthood as the age at which 
a person learns that he must die 
. and accepts his sentence un- 
dismayed.” 

“Prof.” I said, “I know some 
mighty tall children. Seven to two 
some are in Party.” 

“No bet, cobber. I’ll give odds 
that at least half of them don’t 
qualify — and we may find out the 
hard way.” 


“Prof,” Wyoh insisted. “Mike, 
Mannie. Sidris is certain this child 
is an adult. And I think so, too.” 

“Man?” asked Mike. 

“Let’s find way for Prof to meet 
her and form own opinion. I was 
taken by her. Especially her go- 
to-hell fighting. Or would never 
have started it.” 

We adjourned and I heard no 
more. Hazel showed up at dinner 
shortly thereafter as Sidris’ guest. 
She showed no sign of recognizing 
me, nor did I admit that I had ever 
seen her — but learned long after 
that she had recognized me, not just 
by left arm but because I had been 
hatted and kissed by tall blonde 
from Hong Kong. Furthermore 
Hazel had seen through Wyoming’s 
disguise, recognized what Wyoh 
never did successfully disguise: her 
voice. 

But Hazel used lip glue. If she 
ever assumed I was in conspiracy 
she never showed .it. 

Child’s history explained her, far 
as background can explain steely 
character. Transported with parents 
as a baby much as Wyoh had been, 
she had lost father through acci- 
dent while he was convict labor, 
which her mother blamed on in- 
difference of Authority to safety 
of penal colonists. Her mother 
lasted till Hazel was five. What she 
died from Hazel did not know; she 
was then living in creche where we 
found her. Nor did she know why 
parents had been shipped — possib- 
ly for subversion if they were both 
under sentence as Hazel thought. As 
mav be; her mother left her a 
fierce hatred of Authority. 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS

Family that ran Cradle Roll let 
her stay. Hazel was pinning diapers 
and washing dishes as soon as she 
could reach. She had taught her- 
self to read, and could print let- 
ters but could not write. Her knowl- 
edge of math was only that ability 
to count money that children soak 
up through their skins. 

Was fuss over her leaving creche; 
owner and husbands claimed Hazel 
owed several years service. Hazel 
solved it by walking out, leaving 
her few clothes and fewer belong- 
ings behind. Mum was angry enough 
to want family to start trouble 
which could wind up in “brawling” 
she despised. But I told her pri- 
vately that, as her cell leader, I did 
not want our family in public eye — 
and hauled out cash and told her 
Party would pay for clothes for 
Hazel. Mum refused money, called 
off a family meeting, took Hazel 
into town and was extravagant — 
for Mum — in re-outfitting her. 

S o we adopted Hazel. I under- 
stand that these days adopting 
a child involves red tape; in those 
days it was as simple as adopting 
a kitten. 

Was more fuss when started to 
place Hazel in school, which fit- 
ted neither what Sidris had in mind 
nor what Hazel had been led to 
expect as a Party member and 
comrade. Again I butted in and 
Mum gave in part way. Hazel was 
placed in a tutoring school close 
to Sidris* shop — that is, near ease- 
ment lock thirteen; beauty parlor 
was by it (Sidris had good busi- 
ness because close enough that our 


water was piped in, and used with- 
out limit as return line took it back 
for salvage). Hazel studied morn- 
ings and helped in afternoons, pin- 
ning on gowns, handing out towels, 
giving rinses, learning trade — and 
whatever else Sidris Wanted. 

“Whatever else” was captain of 
Baker Street Irregulars. 

Hazel had handled younger kids 
all her short life. They liked her; 
she could wheedle them into any- 
thing; she understood what they said 
when an adult would find it gib- 
berish. She was a perfect bridge 
between Party and most junior 
auxiliary. She could make a game 
of chores we assigned and persuade 
them to play by rules she gave them, 
and never let them know it was 
adult-serious — but child-serious, 
which is another matter. 

For example: 

Let’s say a little one, too young 
to read, is caught with a stack of 
subversive literature — which hap- 
pened more than once. Here’s how 
it would go. after Hazel indoctrin- 
ated a kid: 

Adult: “Baby, where did you get 
this?” 

Baker Street Irregular: “I’m not 
a baby, I’m a big boy!” 

Adult: “Okay, big boy, where 

did you get this?” 

B.S.I.: “Jackie give it to me.” 

Adult: “Who is Jackie?” 

B.S.I.: “Jackie.” 

Adult: “But what’s his last 
name?” 

B.S.I.: “Who?” 

Adult: “Jackie.” 

B.S.I.: (scornfully) "Jackie's a 
girl!" 


92 


IP 



Adult: “All right, where does she 
live?” 

B.S.I.: “Who?” 

And so on around — To all ques- 
tions key answer was of pattern: 
“Jackie give it to me.” Since Jac- 
kie didn’t exist, he (she) didn’t have 
a last name, a home address, nor 
fixed sex. Those children enjoyed 
making fools of adults, once they 
learned how easy it was. 

At worst, literature was confis- 
cated. Even a squad of Peace Dra- 
goons thought twice before trying 
to “arrest” a small child. Yes, we 
were beginning to have squads of 
Dragoon inside Luna City, but nev- 
er less than a squad — some had 
gone in singly and not come bade. 

XDC 

W hen Mike started writing poet- 
ry I didn’t know whether to 
laugh or cry. He wanted to publish 
it! Shows how thoroughly humanity 
had corrupted this innocent ma- 
chine that he should wish to see 
his name in print. 

I said, “Mike, for Bog’s sake! 
Blown all circuits?” 

Before he could sulk Prof said, 
“Hold on, Manuel; I see possibili- 
ties. Mike, would it suit you to 
take a pen name?” 

That’s how “Simon Jester” was 
born. Mike picked it apparently by 
tossing random numbers. But he 
used another name for serious 
verse — “Adam Selene.*’ 

“Simon’s” verse was doggerel, 
bawdy, subversive, ranging from 
poking fun at vips to savage at- 
tacks on Warden, system. Peace 


Dragoons, finks. You found it on 
walls of public W.C.s, or on scraps 
of paper left in tube capsules. Or 
in taprooms. Wherever they were 
they were signed “Simon Jester” and 
with a matchstick drawing of a lit 
tie horned devil with big grin and 
forked tail. Sometimes he was stab 
bing a fat man with a pitchfork 
Sometimes just his face would ap 
pear, big grin and horns, until 
shortly even horns and grin meant 
“Simon was here.” 

Simon appeared all over Luna 
same day and from then on never 
let up. Shortly he started receiving 
volunteer help; his verses and lit 
tie pictures, so simple anybody could 
draw them, began appearing more 
places than we had planned 
This wider coverage had to be 
from fellow travelers. Verses and 
cartoons started appearing inside 
Complex — which could not have 
been our work; we never recruited 
civil servants. Also, three days after 
initial appearance of a very rough 
limerick, one that implied that War 
den’s fatness derived from unsavory 
habits, this limerick popped up on 
pressure-sticky labels with cartoon 
improved so that fat victim flinch 
ing from Simon’s pitchfork was rec 
ognizably Mort the Wart. We didn’t 
buy them, we didn’t print them. But 
they appeared in L-City and Novy 
len and Hong Kong, stuck almost 
everywhere — public phones, stan 
chions in corridors, pressure lock 
ramp railings, other. 

I had a sample count made, fed 
it to Mike. He reported that over 
seventy thousand labels had been 
used in L-City alone. 


THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


93 



I did not know of a printing 
plant in L-City willing to risk such 
a job and equipped for it. Began 
to wonder if might be another revo- 
lutionary cabal? 

S imon’s verses were such a suc- 
cess that he branched out as 
a poltergeist and neither Warden 
nor security chief was allowed to 
miss it. “Dear Mort the Wart,” ran 
one letter, ‘‘Do please be careful 
from midnight to four hundred 
tomorrow. Love & Kisses, Simon” — 
with horns and grin. In same mail 
Mvarez received one reading: “Dear 
Pimplehead, If the Warden breaks 
iiis leg tomorrow night it will be 
vour fault. Faithfully your con- 
science, Simon” — again with horns 
and smile. 

We didn’t have anything planned; 
we just wanted Mort and Alvarez 
to lose sleep — which they did, plus 
bodyguard. All Mike did was to call 
Warden’s private phone at inter- 
vals from midnight to four hundred 
— an unlisted number supposedly 
known only to his personal staff. 
By calling members of his personal 
staff simultaneously and connect- 
ing them to Mort Mike not only 
created confusion but got Warden 
angry at his assistants — he flatly 
refused to believe their denials. 

But was luck that Warden, goad- 
ed too far, ran down a ramp. Even 
a new chum does that onlv once, 
so he walked on air and sprained an 
ankle — close enough to a broken 
leg. And Alvarez was there when 
it happened. 

These sleep-losers were mostly 
just that. Like rumor that Authority 


catapult had been mined and would 
be blown up, another night. Ninety 
plus eighteen men can’t search a 
hundred kilometers of catapult in 
hours, especially when ninety are 
Peace Dragoons not used to p-suit 
work and hating it — this midnight 
came at new earth with Sun high; 
they were outside far longer than 
is healthy, managed to cook up their 
own accidents while almost cooking 
themselves, and showed nearest thing 
to mutiny in regiment’s history. Ona 
accident was fatal. Did he fall or 
was he pushed? A sergeant. 

Midnight alarums made Peace 
Dragoons on passport watch much 
taken by yawning and more bad- 
tempered, which produced more 
clashes with Loonies and still great- 
er resentment both ways — so Simon 
increased pressure. 

A dam Selene’s verse was on a high- 
er plane. Mike submitted it to 
Prof and accepted his literary judg- 
ment (good, I think) without re- 
sentment. Mike’s scansion and 
rhyming were perfect, Mike being 
a computer with whole English lan- 
guage in his memory and able to 
search for a fitting word in micro- 
seconds. What was weak was self- 
criticism. That improved rapidly un- 
der Prof’s stern editorship. 

Adam Selene’s by-line appeared 
first in dignified pages of Moonglow 
over a somber poem titled: Home. 
Was dying thoughts of old trans- 
portee, his discovery as he is about 
to leave that Luna is his beloved 
home. Language was simple, rhyme 
scheme unforced, only thing faint- 
ly subversive was conclusion on 


94 


IF 



part of dying man that even many 
Wardens he has endured was not 
too high a price. 

Doubt if Moonglow’s editors 
thought twice. Was good stuff, they 
published. 

Alvarez turned editorial office 
inside out trying to get a line back 
to “Adam Selene.” Issue had been 
on sale half a lunar before Al- 
varez noticed it, or had it called 
to his attention; we were fretted, 
we wanted that by-line noticed. We 
were much pleased with way Al- 
varez oscillated when he saw it. 

Editors were unable to help fink 
boss. They told him truth: Poem 
had come in by mail. Did they have 
it? Yes, surely . sorry, no en- 
velope; they were never saved. After 
a long time Alvarez left, flanked 
by four Dragoons he had fetched 
along for his health. 

Hope he enjoved studying that 
sheet of paper. Was piece of Adam 
Selene’s business stationery: 

SELENE ASSOCIATES 
Luna City 

Investments Office of the Chairman 

Old Dome 

— and under that was typed Home, 
by Adam Selene, etc. 

Any fingerprints were added af- 
ter it left us. Had been typed on 
Underwood Office Electrostator, 
commonest model in Luna. Even so, 
were not too many as are impor- 
tado; a scientific detective could 
have identified machine. Would 
have found it in Luna City office 
of Lunar Authority. Machines, 
should say, as we found six of model 
in office and used them in rotation, 

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS 


five words and move to next. Cost 
Wyoh and self sleep and too much 
risk even though Mike listened at 
every phone, ready to warn. Never 
did it that way again. Alvarez was 
not a scientific detective.

I had too much to do. Could not 
neglect customers. Party work 
took more time even though all 
possible was delegated. But deci- 
sions had to be made on endless 
things and messages passed up and 
down. Had to squeeze in hours of 
heavy exercise, wearing weights, 
and dasn’t arrange permission to 
use centrifuge at Complex, one used 
by earthworm scientists to stretch 
time in Luna. While had used it 
before, this time could not adver- 
tise that I was getting in shape 
for Earthside. 

Exercising without centrifuge is 
less efficient and was especially bor- 
ing because did not know there 
woufd be need for it. But according 
to Mike thirty per cent of ways 
events could fall required some 
Loonie, able to speak for Party, to 
make trip to Terra. 

Could not see myself as an am- 
bassador, don’t have education and 
not diplomatic. Prof was obvious 
choice of those recruited or likely 
to be. But Prof was old, might not 
live to land Earthside. Mike told 
us that a man of Profs age, body 
type, etc., had less than 40% chance 
of reaching Terra alive. 

But Prof did gaily undertake 
strenuous training to let him make 
most of his poor chances. So what 

95 



could do but put on weights and 
get to work, ready to go and take 
his place if old heart clicked off? 
Wyoh did same, on assumption that 
something might keep me from go- 
ing. She really did it to share mis- 
ery. Wyoh always used gallantry in 
place of logic. 

On top of business, Party Work 
and exercise was farming. We had 
lost three sons by marriage while 
gaining two fine lads, Frank and 
Ali. Then Greg went to work for 
LuNoHoCo, as boss drillman on new 
catapult. 

Was needful. Much skull sweat 
went into hiring construction crew. 
We could use non-Party men for 
most jobs, but key spots had to be 
Party men as competent as they 
were politically reliable. Greg did 
not want to go; our farm needed 
him and he did not like to leave 
his congregation. But accepted. 

That made me again a valet, part 
time, to pigs and chickens. Hans is 
a good farmer, picked up load and 
worked enough for two men. But 
Greg had been farm manager since 
Grandpaw retired. New responsibili- 
ty worried Hans. Should have been 
mine, being senior, but Hans was 
better farmer and closer to it; al- 
ways been expected he would suc- 
ceed Greg some day. So I backed 
him up by agreeing with his opin- 
ions and tried to be half a farm 
hand in hours I could squeeze. Left 
no time to scratch. 

Late in February I was returning 
from long trip, Novylen, Tycho 
Under, Churchill. New tube had 
just been completed across Sinus 
Medii, so I went on to Hong Kong in 


Luna — business, and did make con- 
tacts now that I could promise 
emergency service. Fact that Ends- 
ville-Beluthihatchie bus ran only 
during dark semi-lunar had made 
impossible before. 

But business was cover for poli- 
tics. Liaison with Hong Kong had 
been thin. 

Wyoh had done well by phone. 
Second member of her cell was an 
old comrade — Comrade “Clayton” 
— who not only had clean bill of 
health in Alvarez’s File Zebra but 
also stood high in Wyoh’s estima- 
tion. Clayton was briefed on policies, 
warned of bad apples, encouraged 
to start cell system while leaving 
old organization untouched. Wyoh 
told him to keep his membership, 
as before. 

But phone isn’t face-to-face. Hong 
Kong should have been our strong- 
hold. Was less tied to" Authority 
as its utilities were not controlled 
from Complex; was less dependent 
because lack (until recently) of tube 
transport had made selling at cata- 
pult head less inviting; was stronger 
financially as Bank of Hong Kong 
Luna notes were better money than 
Authority scrip. 

I suppose Hong Kong dollars 
weren’t “money” in some legal 
sense. Authority would not accept 
them; times I went Earthside had to 
buy Authority scrip to pay for ticket. 
But what I carried was Hong Kong 
dollars as could be traded Earth- 
side at a small discount whereas 
scrip was nearly worthless there. 
Money or not, Hong Kong Bank 
notes were backed by honest Chinee

IF 



hankers instead of being fiat of 
bureaucracy. One hundred Hong 
Kong dollars was 31.1 grams of 
gold (old troy ounce) payable on 
demand at home office — and they 
did keep gold there, fetched up 
from Australia. Or you could de- 
man commodities: non-potable wa- 
ter, steel of defined grade, heavy 
water of power plant specs, other 
things. Could buy these with scrip 
too, but Authority’s prices kept 
changing, upward. 

I’m no fiscal theorist. Time Mike 
tried to explain I got headache. 
Simply know we were glad to lay 
hands on this non-money whereas 
scrip one accepted reluctantly and 
not just because we hated Authority. 

Hong Kong should have been 
Party's stronghold. But was _ not. 
We had decided that I should risk 
face-to-face there, letting some know 
my identity, as a roan with one 
arm can’t disguise easily. Was risk 
that would jeopardize not only me 
but could lead to Wyoh, Mum, Greg . 
and Sidris if I took a fall. But who * 
.said revolution was safe? 

Comrade “Clayton” turned out 
to be a young Japanese — not too 
young, but all look young till sud- 
denly look old. He was not all 
Japanese — Malay and other things 
— but had Japanese name and 
household had Japanese manners. 
‘Giri’ and ‘gimu’ controlled and it 
was my good fortune that he owed 
much gimu to Wyoh. 

Clayton was not convict ances- 
try; his people had been “volun- 
teers” marched aboard ship at gun- 
point during time Great China con- 
solidated Earthside empire. I didn’t 


hold it against him. He hated War- 
den as bitterly as any old lag. 

Met him first at a teahouse — -tap- 
room to us L-City types — and fa* 
two hours we talked everything but 
politics. He made up mind about 
me, took me home. My only com- 
plaint about Japanese hospitality h 
those chin-high baths are too bleed- 
ing hot 

But turned out I was not Jeopar- 
dized. Mama-San was as skilled M 
makeup as Sidris, my social arm is 
very convincing, and a kimono cow- 
ered its seam. Met four cells in two 
days, as “Comrade Bork” and wear- 
ing makeup and kimono and tab! 
and, if a spy was among them, 
don’t think he could identify Man- 
uel O’Kelly. I lad gone there in- 
tensely briefed, endless figures and 
projections, and talked about jus* 
one thing: famine in ’82, six yearn 
away. “You people are hicky, won’t 
•be hit so soon. But now with new 
tube, you are going to see more 
and more of your people turning to 
wheat and rice and shipping it to 
catapult head. Your time will come.” 1 

They were impressed. Old organ- 
ization, as I saw it and from what 
I heard, relied on oratory, whoop- 
it-up music and emotion, much like 
church. I simply said, “There it is, 
comrades. Check those figures; I’B 
leave them with you.” 

Met one comrade separately. A 
Chinee engineer given a good look 
at anything can figure way to make 
it. Asked this one if he had ever 
seen a laser gun small enough t® 
carry like a rifle. He had not.

days. He said thoughtfully that 
jewels ought not to .be hard - — and 
he would be in Luna City next week 
to see his cousin. I said Uncle Adam 
would be pleased to hear from him. 

All in all was productive trip. 

On my way back I stopped in 
Novylen to check an old-fashioned 
punched-tape “Foreman” I had over- 
hauled earlier, had lunch afterwards, 
ran into my father. 

H e and I were friendly but didn't 
matter if we let a couple of 
years go by. We talked through a 
sandwich and beer and as I got up 
he said, “Nice to see you, Mannie. 
Free Luna!” 

I echoed, too startled not to. My 
old man was as cynically non-poli- 
tical as you could find; if he would 
say that in public, campaign must 
be taking hold. 

So I arrived in L-City cheered up 
and not too tired, having napped 
from Torricelli. Took Belt from 
Tube South, then dropped down 
through Bottom Alley, avoiding 
Causeway crowds and heading home. 
Went into Judge Brody’s courtroom 


as I came to it, meaning to say 
hello. Brody is old friend and we 
have amputation in common. After 
he lost a leg he set up as a judge 
and was quite successful; was not 
another judge in L-City at that time 
who did not have side business, at 
least make book or sell insurance. 

If two people brought a quarrel 
to Brody and he could not get them 
to agree that his settlement was 
just, he would return fees and, if 
they fought, referee their duel with- 
out charging — and still be trying 
to persuade them not to use knives 
right up to squaring off. 

He wasn’t in his courtroom 
though plug hat was on desk. I 
knew he was probably in one of 
the bars nearby. 

Did not know, however, that this 
would mean that the life of our 
revolution would, literally, be put 
into my hands within next few min- 
utes. For as I started to leave was 
checked by groups coming in. Stil- 
yagi types. Had with them a girl 
and an older man. Wished to kill 
the man; had come to get judge’s 
permission.

IF + Short Story 


MR. JESTER 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 


Men had forgotten laughter . and 
the Berserkers had never known itl 


A t last the berserker machines’ 
age-long raid across the galaxy 
had brought them against a life-form 
too strong to be wiped out of the 
way — a race of two-legged crea- 
tures who were clever and stubborn, 
far-scattered and well-armed, sprung 
from a planet that the ancient Ber- 
serker-Builders had never known ex- 
isted. 

Defeated in battle, the berserker- 
computers saw that refitting, repair, 
and the construction of new ma- 
chines were necessary. They sought 
out sunless, hidden places, where 
minerals were available but where 
men — who were now as often the 
hunters as the hunted — were not 
likely to show up. And in such sec- 
ret places they set up automated 
shipyards. 

To one such concealed shipyard, 
seeking repair, there came a ber- 
serker. 


Its spherical hull, thirty miles in 
diameter, had been torn open in a 
recent battle, and it had suffered 
severe internal damage. It collapsed 
rather than landed on the dark plan- 
etoid, beside the half-finished hull 
of a new machine. Before emergen- 
cy repairs could be started, the en- 
gines of the damaged machine fail- 
ed, its emergency power failed, and 
like a wounded living thing it died. 

The shipyard-computers were cap- 
able of wide improvisation. They 
surveyed the extent of the damage, 
weighed various courses of action, 
and then swiftly began to cannibal- 
ize. Instead of embodying the deadly 
purpose of the new machine in a 
new forcefield brain, following the 
replication-instructions of the Build- 
ers, they took the old brain with 
many another part from the wreck. 

The Builders had not foreseen 
that this might happen, and so the 


99 


shipyard-computers did not know 
that in the forcefield brain of each 
original berserker there was a safety 
switch. The switch was there because 
the original machines had been 
launched by living Builders, who 
had wanted to survive while testing 
their own life-destroying creations. 

When the brain was moved from 
one hull to another, the safety switch 
reset itself. 

The old brain awoke in control 
of a mighty new hull, of weapons 
that could sterilize a planet, new 
engines to hurl the whole mass far 
faster than light. 

But there was no Builder present, 
and no timer, to turn off the simple 
safety switch. 

T he jester — the accused jester, 
but he was as good as con- 
victed — was on the carpet. He stood 
facing a row of stiff necks and 
granite faces, behind a long table. 
On either side of him was a tridi 
camera. His offenses had been so 
unusually offensive that the Com- 
mittee of Duly Constituted Authority 
themselves, the very rulers of Plan- 
et A, were sitting to pass judgment 
on his case. 

Perhaps the Committee members 
had another reason for this session: 
Planet-wide elections were due in a 
month. No member wanted to miss 
the chance for a non-political tridi 
appearance that would not have to 
be offset by a grant of equal time 
for the new Liberal Party opposition. 

4 *I have this further item of evi- 
dence to present,” the Minister of 
Communication was saying, from his 
teat on the Committee side of the 


long table. He held up what appear- 
ed at first to be an official pedea- 
trian-control sign, having steady 
black letters on a blank white back- 
ground. But the sign read: UNAU- 
THORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. 

“When a sign is put up,” said 
the MiniComm, “the first day, a lot 
of people read it.” He paused, lis- 
tening to himself. “That is, a new 
sign on a busy pedestrian ramp is 
naturally given great attention. Now 
in this sign, the semantic content of 
the first word is confusing in its 
context.” 

The President of the Committee 
— and of the planet — cleared his 
throat warningly. The MiniComm’s 
fondness for stating truisms made 
him sound more stupid than he ac- 
tually was. It seemed unlikely that 
the Liberals were going to present 
any serious challenge at the polls, 
but there was no point in giving 
them encouragement. 

The lady member of the Commit- 
tee, the Minister of Education, wav- 
ed her lorgnette in chubby fingers, 
seeking attention. She inquired: 
“Has anyone computed the cost to 
us all in work-hours of this confus- 
ing sign?” 

“We’re working on it,” growled 
the Minister of Labor, hitching up 
an overall strap. He glared at the 
accused. “You do admit causing 
this sign to be posted?” 

“I do.” The accused was remem- 
bering how so many of the pedes- 
trians on the crowded ramp had 
laughed, and how the day had bright- 
ened for them and for him. What 
did work-hours matter? No one on 
Planet A was starving any longer.

IF 



“You admit that you have never 
done a thing, really, for your planet 
or your people?** Thus spoke the 
Minister of Defense, a tall, power- 
ful, bemedaled figure, armed with 
a ritual pistol. 

“I don’t admit that,” said the ac- 
cused bluntly. *Tve tried to bright- 
en people’s lives.” He had no hope 
erf official leniency anyway. And he 
knew no one was going to take him 
offstage and beat him; the beating 
of prisoners was not authorized. 

“Do you even now attempt to 
defend levity?” The Minister of Phil- 
osophy took his ritual pipe from his 
mouth, and smiled in the grim per- 
missible fashion, baring his teeth 
at the challenge of the Universe. 
“Life is a jest, true; but a grim jest. 
You have lost sight of that. For 
years you have harassed society, 
leading people to drug themselves 
with levity instead of facing the bit- 
ter realities of existence. The pic- 
tures found in your possession could 
do only harm.” 

The President’s hand moved to 
the video recording cube that lay 
on the table before him, neatly lab- 
eled as evidence. In his droning 
voice the President asked: “You do 
admit that these pictures are yours? 
That you used them to try to get 
other people to — yield to mirth?” 

T he prisoner nodded. They could 
prove everything: he had waiv- 
ed his right to a full legal defense, 
wanting only to get the trial over 
with. “Yes, I filled that cube from 
tapes and films I sneaked out of 
libraries and archives. Yes, I show- 
ed people its contents.” 


There was a murmur from the 
Committee. The Minister of Diet, a 
skeletal figure with a repellent glow 
of health in his granite cheeks, rais- 
ed a hand. “Inasmuch as the accus- 
ed seems certain to be convicted, 
may I request in advance that he be 
paroled in my custody? In his ear- 
lier testimony he admitted that one 
of his first acts of deviation was the 
avoidance of his community mess. I 
believe I could demonstrate, using 
this man, the wonderful effect on 
character of dietary discipline — ” 

“I refuse!” the accused interrupt- 
ed loudly. It seemed to him that 
the words ascended, growling, from 
his stomach. 

The President rose, to adroitly fill 
what might have become an awk- 
ward silence. “If no member of the 
Committee has any further questions 
— ? Then let us vote. Is the accused 
guilty as charged on all counts?” 

To the accused, standing with 
weary eyes closed, the vote sounded 
like one voice passing along the 
table: “Guilty. Guilty. Guilty . .” 
After a brief whispered confer- 
ence with the Minister of Defense, 
the President passed sentence, a hint 
of satisfaction in his drone. 

“Having rejected a duly authoriz- 
ed parole, the convicted jester will 
be placed under the orders of the 
Minister of Defense, and sent to sol- 
itary beacon duty out on the Ap- 
proaches, for an indefinite period. 
This will remove his disruptive in- 
fluence, while at the same time con- 
straining him to contribute positively 
to society.” 

For decades Planet A and its sun 
had been cut off from all but oc- 


MR. JESTER 


101 



casionaJ contact with the rest of the 
galaxy, by a vast interstellar dust 
storm that was due to go on for 
more decades at least. So the posi- 
tive contribution to society might be 
doubted. But it seemed that the bea- 
con stations could be used as isola- 
tion prisons without imperilling non- 
existent shipping, or weakening de- 
fense against ah enemy that never 
came. 

“One thing more,” added the Pres- 
ident. “I direct that this recording 
cube be securely fastened around 
your neck on a monomolecular cord, 
in such a way that you may put the 
cube into a viewer when you wish. 
You will be alone on the station and 
no other off-duty activity will be 
available.” 

The President faced toward a tri- 
di camera. “Let me assure the public 


that I derive no satisfaction from 
imposing a punishment that may 
seem harsh, and even — imaginative 
But in recent years a dangerous lev- 
ity has spread among some few of 
our people; a levity all too readily 
tolerated by some supposedly more 
solid citizens.” 

Having gotten in a dig at the 
newly-burgeoning Liberals, a dig he 
might hope to claim was non-politi- 
cal in intent, the President faced 
back to the jester. “A robot will go 
with you to the beacon, to assist 
you in your duties and see to your 
physical safety. I assure you the ro- 
bot will not be tempted into mirth.” 

T he robot took the convicted jes- 
ter out in a little ship, so far 
out that Planet A vanished and its 
sun shrank to a point of brilliance.

felt gravity, and good a*r and pleas- 
ant warmth again, he decided that 
keeping his eyes shut was worse 
than knowing whatever they might 
tell him. His first cautious peek 
showed him that he was in a large 
shadowy room, that at least held no 
visible menace. 

When he stirred, a squeaky mon- 
otonous voice somewhere above him 
said: “My memory bank tells me 
that you are a protoplasmic comput- 
ing unit, probably capable of under- 
standing this language. Do you un- 
derstand?” 

“Me?” The jester looked up into 
the shadows, but could not see the 
speaker. “Yes, I understand you.” 
Most former colonies of Earth still 
spoke close variants of the one lan- 
guage carried out from Sol in the 
years before the berserker-war. “But 
who are you?” the jester ventured. 

“I am what this language calls a 
berserker.” 

The jester had taken shamefully 
little interest in galactic affairs, but 
that word frightened even him. He 
stuttered: “That means you’re a kind 
of automated warship?” 

There was a pause. “I am not 
sure,” said the squeaky, droning 
voice. The tone sounded almost as 
if the President was hiding up there 
in the rafters. “War may be related 
to my purpose, but my purpose is 
still partially unclear to me, for my 
construction was never quite com- 
pleted. For a time I waited where I 
was built, for I was sure some final 
step had been left undone. At last 
I moved, to try to learn more about 
my purpose. Approaching this sun, 
I found a transmitting device which 


1 have disassembled. But I have 
learned no more about my purpose.” 
The jester sat on the soft, com- 
fortable floor. The more he remem- 
bered about berserkers, the more ha 
trembled. He said: “I see. Or per- 
haps I begin to see. What do you 
know of your purpose?” 

“My purpose is to destroy all life, 
wherever I can find it.” 

The jester cowered down. Then 
he asked in a low voice: “What is 
unclear about that?” 

The berserker answered his ques- 
tion with two of its own: “What is 
life? And how is it destroyed?” 

A fter half a minute there came a 
sound that the berserker-com- 
puters could not identify. It issued 
from the protoplasmic computing- 
unit, but if it was speech it was in 
a language unknown to the berserk- 
er. 

“What is the sound you make?” 
the machine asked. 

The jester gasped for breath. “It’s 
laughter! Oh, laughter. So. You 
were unfinished.” He shuddered, the 
terror of his position coming back 
to sober him. But then he once 
more burst out giggling; the situa- 
tion was too ridiculous. 

“What is life?” he said at last 
“I’ll tell you. Life is a great grim 
grayness, and it inflicts fright and 
pain and loneliness upon all who 
experience it. And you want to know 
how to destroy it? Well, I don’t 
think you can. But I’ll tell you the 
best way to fight life — with laugh- 
ter. As long as we fight it that way, 
it can’t overcome us.” 

The machine asked: “Must I 


?04 


IF 



laugh, to prevent this great-grim- 
grayness from enveloping me?” 

The jester thought. “No, you are 
a machine. You are not — ” he 
caught himself — “protoplasmic. 
Fright and pain and loneliness will 
never bother you.” 

“Nothing bothers me. Where will 
I find life, and how will I make 
laughter to fight it?” 

The jester was suddenly conscious 
of the weight of the cube that still 
hung from his neck. “Let me think 
for a while,” he said. 

After a few minutes he stood up. 
“If you have a viewer of the kind 
men use, I can show you how laugh- 
ter is created. And perhaps I can 
guide you to a place where life is. 
By the way, can you cut this cord 
from my neck? Without hurting me, 
that is!” 

A few weeks later, in the main 
War Room of Planet A, the somno- 
lence of decades was abruptly shat- 
tered. Robots bellowed and buzzed 
and flashed, and those that were 
mobile scurried about. In five min- 
utes or so they managed to rouse 
their human overseers, who hurried 
about, tightening their belts and 
stuttering. 

“This is a practice alert, isn’t it?” 
the Officer of the Day kept hoping 
aloud. “Someone’s running some 
kind of a test? Someone?” He was 
beginning to squeak like a berserker 
himself. 

He got down on all fours, remov- 
ed a panel from the base of the 
biggest robot and peered inside, hop- 
ing to discover something causing 
a malfunction. Unfortunately, he 
knew nothing about robotics; recall- 


ing this, he replaced the panel and 
jumped to his feet. He really knew 
nothing about planet defense, either, 
and recalling this was enough to 
send him on a screaming run for 
help. 

So there was no resistance, effec- 
tive or otherwise. But there was no 
attack, either. 

The forty-mile sphere, unopposed, 
came down to hove directly above 
Capital City, low enough for its 
shadow to send a lot of puzzled birds 
to nest at noon. Men and birds alike 
lost many hours of productive work 
that day; somehow it made less dif- 
ference than most of the men ex- 
pected. The days were past when 
only the grimmest attention to duty 
let the human race survive on Plan- 
et A, though most of the planet did 
not yet realize it. 

tt'Tpell the President to hurry 
up,” demanded the jester’s 
image, from a viewscreen in the no- 
longer somnolent War Room. ‘Tell 
him it’s urgent that I talk to him.” 

The President, breathing heavily, 
had just entered. “I am here. I 
recognize you, and I remember your 
trial.” 

“Odd, so do I.” 

“Have you now stooped to trea- 
son? Be assured that if you have led 
a berserker to us you can expect no 
mercy from your government.” 

The image made a forbidden 
noise, a staccato sound from an 
open mouth, head thrown back. “Oh, 
please, mighty President! Even I 
know our Ministry of Defense is a 
j-o-k-e, if you will pardon an ob- 
scene word. It’s a catchbasin for ex- 


MR. JESTER 


105 



ifes and incompetents. So I come to 
offer mercy, not ask it. Also, I have 
decided to legally take the name of 
Jester Kindly continue to apply it 
to me.” 

“We have nothing to say to you!” 
barked the Minister of Defense. He 
was purple granite, having entered 
just in time to hear his Ministry in- 
sulted. 

“We have no objection to talking 
to you!” contradicted the President, 
hastily. Having failed to overawe the 
Jester through a viewscreen, he could 
now almost feel the berserker’s 
weight upon his head. 

“Then let us talk,” said Jester’s 
image. “But not so privately. This 
is what I want.” 

What he wanted, he said, was a 
face-to-face parley with the Commit- 
tee, to be broadcast live on planet- 
wide tridi. He announced that he 
would come “properly attended” to 
the conference. And he gave assur- 
ance that the berserker was under 
his full control, though he did not 
explain how. It, he said, would not 
start any shooting. 

The Minister of Defense was not 
ready to start anything. But he and 
his aides hastily made secret plans. 

Like almost every other citizen, 
the presidential candidate of the 
Liberal party settled himself before 
a tridi on the fateful evening, to 
watch the confrontation. He had an 
air of hopefulness, for any sudden 
event may bring hope to an under- 
dog politician. 

Few others on the planet saw 
anything encouraging in the berserk- 
er’s descent, but still there was no 
mass panic. Berserkers and war were 


unreal things to the long-isotated 
people of Planet A. 

“Are we ready?” asked the Jester 
nervously, looking over the mechan- 
ical delegation that was about to 
board a launch with him for the 
descent to Capital City. 

“What you have ordered, I have 
done,” squeaked the berserker-voice 
from the shadows above. 

“Remember,” Jester cautioned, 
“the protoplasmic-units down there 
are much under the influence of life. 
So ignore whatever they say Be 
careful not to hurt them, but out- 
side of that you can improvise with- 
in my general plan.” 

“All this is in my memory from 
your previous orders,” said the ma- 
chine patiently. 

“Then let’s go.” Jester straight- 
ened his shoulders. “Bring me my 
cloak!” 

T he brilliantly lighted interior of 
Capital City’s great Meeting 
Hall displayed a kind of rigid, rec- 
tilinear beauty. In the center of the 
Hall there had been placed a long, 
polished table, flanked on opposing 
sides by chairs. 

Precisely at the appointed time, 
the watching millions saw one set 
of entrance doors swing mathemati- 
cally open. In marched a dozen 
human heralds, their faces looking 
almost robotic under bearskin hel- 
mets. They halted with a single 
snap. Their trumpet-tucket rang out 
clearly. 

To the taped strains of Pomp and 
Circumstance, the President, in the 
full dignity of his cloak of office, 
then made his entrance. 


106 


IF 



He moved at the pace of a man 
marching to his own execution, but 
his was the slowness of dignity, not 
that of fear. The Committee had 
overruled the purple protestations of 
the MiniDef, and convinced them- 
selves that the military danger was 
small. Real berserkers did not ask 
to parley, they slaughtered when 
they could. Somehow the Commit- 
tee could not take Jester seriously, 
any more than they could laugh at 
him. But until they were sure they 
had him again under their control 
they would humor him. 

The granite-faced Minister enter- 
ed in a double file behind the 
President. It took almost five min- 
utes of Pomp and Circumstance for 
them all to position themselves. 

A launch had been seen to de- 
scend from the berserker, and ve- 
hicles had rolled from the launch 
to the Meeting Hall. It was presum- 
ed that Jester was ready, and the 
cameras pivoted dutifully to face the 
entrance reserved for them. 

Just at the appointed time, the 
doors of that entrance swung math- 
ematically open, and a dozen man- 
sized machines entered. They were 
heralds, for they wore bearskin hel- 
mets, and each carried a bright, 
brassy trumpet. 

All but one, who wore a coonskin 
cap, marched a half-pace out of 
step, and was armed with a slide 
trombone. 

The mechanical tucket was a 
faithful copy of the human one — 
almost. The slide-trombonist faltered 
at the end, and one long sour note 
trailed away. 

Giving an impression of slow 


mechanical horror, the berserker- 
heralds looked at one another. Then 
one by one their heads turned until 
all their lenses were focused upon 
the trombonist. 

It — almost it seemed the figure 
must be he — looked this way and 
that. Tapped the trombone, as if to 
clear it of some defect. Paused. 

Watching, the President was seiz- 
ed by the first pang of a great hor- 
ror. In the evidence against the Jes- 
ter, the obscene mirth-provoking 
evidence, there had been a film of 
an Earthman of ancient time, a bald- 
ing comic violinist, who had had 
the skill to pause like that, just 
pause, and evoke from his filmed 
audience great gales of . 

Twice more the robot heralds 
blew. And twice more the sour note 
was sounded. When the third at- 
tempt failed, the eleven straight-ro- 
bots looked at one another and nod- 
ded agreement. 

Then with robotic speed they 
drew concealed weapons and shot 
holes in the offender. 

A ll across the planet the dike of 
tension was cracking, dribbles 
and spurts of laughter forcing 
through. The dike began to collapse 
completely as the trombonist was 
borne solemnly away by a pair of 
his fallows, his shattered horn clasp- 
ed lily-fashion on his iron breast. 

But no one in the Meeting Hall, 
was laughing. The Minister of De- 
fense made an innocent-looking ges- 
ture, calling off a tentative plan, 
calling it off. There was to be no 
attempt to seize the Jester, for the 
berserker-robot-heralds or whatever

107 



fee y were seemed likely to perform 
wary capably as bodyguards. 

As soon as the riddled herald had 
been carried out. Jester entered. 
Pomp and Circumstance began be- 
latedly as with the bearing of a king 
he moved to his position at the 
center of the table, opposite the 
President. Like the President, the 
Jester wore an elegant cloak, clasp- 
ed in front, falling to his ankles. 
Those that filed in behind him, in 
the position of aides, were also 
richly dressed. 

And each of them was a metallic 
parody, in face and shape, of one 
of the Ministers of the Committee. 

When the plump robotic analogue 
of the Minister of Education peered 
through a lorgnette at the tridi cam- 
era, the watching populace turned, 
in unheard-of millions, to laughter. 
Those who might be outraged later, 
remembering, laughed now in help- 
less approval of seeming danger 
turned to farce. All but the very 
grimmest smiled. 

The Jester-king doffed his cape 
with a flourish. Beneath it he wore 
only a preposterous bathing-suit. In - 
reply to the President’s coldly for- 
mal greeting — the President could 
not be shaken by anything short of 
a physical attack — the Jester 
thoughtfully pursed his lips, then 
opened them and blew a gummy 
substance out into a large pink bub- 
ble. 

The President maintained his un- 
intentional role of slow-burning 
straight man, ably supported by all 
the Committee save one. The Min- 
ister of Defense turned his back on 
fee farce and marched to an exit.

He found two metallic heralds 
planted before fee door, effectively 
blocking it. Glaring at them, the 
MiniDef barked an order to move. 
The metal figures flipped him a 
comic salute, but didn’t move. 

Brave in his anger, fee MiniDef 
tried futilely to shove his way past 
the berserker-heralds. Dodging an- 
other salute, he looked round at the 
sound of great clomping footsteps. 
His berserker-counterpart was march- 
ing toward him across the Hall. It 
was a clear foot taller than he, and 
its barrel chest was armored with a 
double layer of jangling medals. 

Before the MiniDef paused to 
consider consequences, his hand had 
moved to his sidearm. But his metal 
parody was far faster on the draw; 
it hauled out a grotesque cannon 
with a fist-sized bore, and fire in- 
stantly. 

“Gah!” The MiniDef staggered 
back, the world gone red . and 
then he found himself wiping from 
his face something that tasted sus- 
piciously like tomato. 

The cannon had propelled a whole 
fruit, or a convincing imitation, skin 
and all. 

The MiniComm jumped to his 
feet, and began to expound the idea 
that the proceedings were becoming 
frivolous. His counterpart also rose, 
and replied with a burst of gabble 
in speed-falsetto. 

The pseudo-Minister of Philo- 
sophy rose as if to speak, was 
pricked with a long pin by a prank- 
ish herald, and jetted fluttering 
through the air, a balloon collapsing 
in flight. At that the human Com- 
mittee fell into babel, into panic. 

IF 



Under the direction of the metal 
MiniDiet, the real one, arch-villain 
to the lower masses, began to take 
unwilling part in a demonstration of 
dietary discipline. Machines gripped 
him, spoon-fed him grim gray food, 
napkined him, squirted drink into 
his mouth — and then, as if unin- 
tentionally, they gradually fell out 
of synch with spoon and squirt, their 
aim becoming less and less accurate. 

Only the President still stood root- 
ed in dignity. He had one hand 
cautiously in his trousers pocket, for 
he had felt a sly robotic touch, and 
had reason to suspect that his sus- 
penders had been cut. 

As a tomato grazed his nose, and 
the MiniDiet writhed and choked in 
the grip of his remorseless feeders, 
balanced nutrients running from his 
ears, the President closed his eyes. 

J ester was, after all, only a self- 
taught amateur working without 
a visible audience to play to. He was 
unable to calculate a climax for the 
show. So when he ran out of jokes 
he simply called his minions to his 
side, waved good-by to the tridi 
cameras and exited. 

Outside the Hall, he was much 
encouraged by the cheers and laugh- 
ter he received from the crowds fast- 
gathering in the streets. He had his 
machines entertain them with an 
improvised chase-sequence back to 
the launch parked on the edge of 
Capital City. 

He was about to board the launch, 
return to the berserker and await 
developments, when a small group 
of men hurried out of the crowd, 
calling to him. “Mr. Jester!” 


The performer could now afford 
to relax and laugh himself. “1 like 
the sound of that name! What can 
I do for you gentlemen?” 

They hurried up to him, smiling. 
The one who seemed to be their 
leader said: “Provided you get rid 
of this berserker or whatever it is, 
harmlessly — you can join the Liber- 
al party ticket. As Vice-Presidential 
candidate.” 

Another of them said: “Stay, hear 
us out. As a political candidate 
you’re immune from arrest while 
the campaign’s on. And after the 
election, judging by what I’ve seen 
tonight, you’ll be Vice-President!” 
He had to listen for some minutes 
before he could believe they ,were 
serious 

He protested: “But I only 

wanted to have some fun with them, 
to shake them up a bit ” 

“You’re a catalyst. Mr. Jester. 
You’ve formed a rallying point. 
You’ve shaken up the whole planet 
and made it think.” 

Jester accepted the Liberals’ offer 
at last. They were still sitting about 
in front of the launch, talking and 
planning, when the light of Planet 
A’s moon fell full and sudden upon 
them. 

Looking up, they saw the vast 
bulk of the berserker dwindling into 
the heavens, vanishing toward the 
stars in eerie silence. Cloud stream- 
ers went aurora in the upper atmo- 
sphere to honor its departure. 

“I don’t know,” Jester said, over 
and over, responding to a dozen ex- 
cited questions. “I don’t know.” He 
looked at the sky, puzzled as any- 
one else. The edge of fear came 


MR. JESTER 


109 



back. The robotic Committee and 
heralds, which had been controlled 
from the berserker, began one by 
one to collapse like dying men. 

Suddenly the heavens were briefly 
alight with a gigantic splashing flare 
that passed like lightning from east 
to west, not breaking the silence of 
the stars. Ten minutes later came the 
first news bulletin: The berserker 
had been destroyed. 

Then came the President, who was 
close to the brink of showing emo- 
tion. He announced that under the 
heroic personal leadership of the 
Minister of Defense, the few gallant 
warships of Planet A had met' and 
defeated, utterly annihilated, the 
menace. Not a man had been lost, 
though the MiniDefs flagship was 
thought to be heavily damaged. 

When he heard that his great 
machine-ally had been destroyed, 
Jester felt a pang of something like 
sorrow. But die pang was quickly 
obliterated in a greater joy. No one 
had been hurt, after all. Overcome 
with relief, Jester looked away from 
the tridi for a moment. 

He missed the climactic moment 
of the speech, which came when 
fee President forgetfully removed 
both hands from his pockets. 

T he Minister of Defense — today 
the new Presidential candidate 
of a Conservative party stirred to 
grim enthusiasm by his exploit of the 
night before — was puzzled by the 
reactions of some people, who seem- 
ed to think he had merely spoiled 
a jest instead of saving the planet. 
As if spoiling a jest was not a good 
thing in itself! 


On this busiest of days fee Mh&> 
Def allowed himself time to visit 
Liberal headquarters to do a bit of 
gloating. Graciously he delivered to 
the opposition leaders what was al- 
ready becoming his standard speech. 

“When it answered my challenge 
and came up to fight, we went in 
with a standard englobement pattern 
— like hummingbirds round a vul- 
ture, I suppose you might say. And 
did you really think it was jesting? 
Let me tell you, that berserker peel- 
ed away the defensive fields from 
my ship like they were nothing. And 
then it launched this ghastly thing 
at me, a kind of disk. My gunners 
were a little rusty, maybe, anyway 
they couldn’t stop it and it hit us. 

“I don’t mind saying, I thought 
I’d bought the farm right then. My 
ship’s still hanging in orbit for de- 
contamination, I’m afraid I’ll get 
word any minute that the metal’s 
melting or something — anyway, we 
sailed right through and hit the 
bandit with everything we had. I 
can’t say too much for my crew. 
One thing I don’t quite understand; 
when our missiles struck that ber- 
serker just went poof, as if it had 
no defense up at all. Yes?” 

“Call for you, Minister,” said an 
aide. 

“Thank you.” The MiniDef lis- 
tened to the phone, and his smile left 
him. His form went rigid. “Analy- 
sis of the weapon shows what? Syn- 
thetic proteins and water?” 

He jumped to his feet, glaring 
upward as if to pierce the ceiling 
and see the ship in orbit. “What do 
you mean — no more than a giant 
custard pie?” END

I t began while the huge, gray- 
skinned workers docilely loaded 
kamun - wood logs into the Dorade 
Corporation ship. 

A man from the Home Office 
had come out from Earth to see 
that all the orders from home were 
being efficiently carried out. Chalm- 
ers showed him the sights of the 
planet. He’d waked the visitor early 


so he could see sunrise on Dorade, 
which was remarkable, and the staff 
living-quarters, which were not. He 
showed the electrified- wire stockade, 
which any of the imprisoned work- 
ers could have broken through in an 
instant, except that he’d been con- 
ditioned to believe it impregnable. 
There were the fields where big 
workers — under human supervision, 
of course — grew the food for them- 
selves and the forest-trained mem- 


111 



Jbtrs of their race. And near sun- 
down Chalmers took his guest to 
the edge of the Forest to see a 
kamun tree. 

Kamun trees, of course, were the 
reason for the existence of the Cor- 
poration, and the electrified fence — 
but there were also small stockades 
built solidly of logs — and every- 
thing else that men had done on 
Dorade. 

The Corporation ship was almost 
fully loaded by then. It should be 
ready to lift off within the hour. 
The last act of the Home Office 
man would be to give Chalmers new 
orders for the conduct of affairs 
here. The Home Office always sent 
orders. And Chalmers always got 
them too late in each ship-visit to be 
able to protest any of them. This 
was Corporation policy. 

But the man from home hadn’t 
yet seen a kamun tree. So Chalmers 
took him to the edge of the Forest. 

The sunset colors were very beau- 
tiful and the Forest was beautiful, 
too, in the many-tinted light. Some 
of the trees looked familiar — they 
weren’t — and some were surprising. 
But the Home Office man had to 
have a kamun tree singled out for 
him. It wasn’t at all conspicuous 

Chalmers pointed. 

“There’s one,” he said. “We don’t 
gO into the Forest ourselves. The 
damned things are too quick. If one 
caught you, you’d have to use a 
blaster to get away — if you got 
away! But the Corporation doesn’t 
like trees worth some thousands of 
credits to be blasted.” 

The man from Earth murmured 
politely. The kamun tree was quite 


small and looked ordinary. There 
were more visible roots about its 
base than usual, but there are trees 
cm Earth like that. 

“I’d like to see one in action,” he 
said. 

“I wouldn’t,” said Chalmers. 

H e waited for the Home Office 
man to become satisfied with 
looking. Then, deep in die Forest, 
there was a stirring. Two of the 
Dorade Corporation’s workers show- 
ed, in speckles of sunset light among 
the trees. 

Fewer than one in a thousand of 
the Forest growths were kamun 
trees, of course. The workers had 
to hunt for them, inside the electri- 
fied fence that surrounded the Whole 
Forest and kept them imprisoned 
with their work. He nodded at the 
two huge creatures as they ap- 
proached. 

“Workers,” he explained. “The 
trees hate them. You may see some- 
thing.” 

But he didn’t expect it. The man 
from Earth watched. The two un- 
graceful beasts came lumbering into 
plain view. The larger one — the 
male — stood a good ten feet tall. 
He carried what seemed to be a 
four-inch log, carefully balanced in 
the trunk that served him in the 
place of hands. The female was 
smaller. She followed closely behind 
her mate. The male picked his way 
deliberately, avoiding what few 
kamun trees grew hereabouts 

Other workers appeared. They al- 
ways returned at sunset. They show- 
ed up in pairs, of whom one invar- 
iably carried a kamun log. They 


112 


IF

came slowly and clumsily toward 
the warehouse and the worker’s stalls 
nearby. 

“We don’t go into the Forest our- 
selves,” repeated Chalmers. “The 
workers learn that they’re to look 
for kamun trees just at the stage 
when the foliage has all dropped 
off. That’s when the air-roots — the 
constrictor-roots, you know — dig 
their free ends into the ground to 
become new trees. That’s the time 
for the logs to be taken. But — ” 
He stopped. 

The nearer, larger worker turn- 
ed deliberately to avoid the kamun 
tree Chalmers had pointed out. The 
female behind him moved abstractly 
ahead for four or five paces. Then — 
The visible, above-soil roots of the 
kamun tree lashed out viciously, like 
coiled springs. Two — three — four 
of them struck savagely. One coiled 
about the female’s leg. One seemed 
to claw at her wall-like body. An- 
other gripped and tore at a huge, 
flopping ear. Thorns on the root 
tore at the flesh. Blood flowed. She 
squealed. 

T he big male whirled with incred- 
ible agility for one of his bulk. 
He dropped his burden and rushed 
at the kamun tree. He tore at the 
roots assailing the smaller beast, his 
mate. Other roots struck at him. He 
fought them furiously. They were 
like sinewy, thorny snakes writhing 
to clutch and strangle him. The fe- 
male broke free. The tree turned its 
full attention to him. 

But he’d gained some slack. Now 
he lunged ahead. The roots about 
him seemed to stretch. If they held, 

114 


by sheer weight and impetus he 
might uproot the tree. 

But the roots snapped away, torn 
free. The tree seemed to quiver with 
rage. Its roots lashed the air crazily. 
The male worker lumbered to the 
other. 

There were rasped-raw wales on 
her hide. She seemed to whimper. 
The male went back to the log he’d 
dropped. He fumbled at it with his 
singularly flexible trunk. He moved 
ferociously toward the tree, raising 
the ten-foot log like a club. He 
brought it down. 

Chalmers went running to stop 
him. He shouted. 

“Hup! Jogo! Hup! Hup!.” 

Something glistened in his hand. 
There was a snapping sound. The 
big worker flinched. 

The roots of the kamun tree 
seemed stunned. They writhed only 
feebly. Chalmers shouted again, 
threatening the big bull worker with 
the glistening thing in his hand. 

The worker dropped the log he’d 
wielded from one end. He picked it 
up again at the middle. He went 
lumbering to his mate. He rumbled 
at her. The two of them went 
slowly, ponderously, heavily to put 
the log where they knew such things 
should be delivered. The other work- 
ers, arriving, formed a long sham- 
bling line to deliver their logs, too. 

He put away the sub-blaster all 
humans on Dorade carried to con- 
trol the workers. They stung, and 
badly, but they did no real damage. 
They were much more effective than 
whips for creatures as huge and 
relatively as intelligent as the work- 
ing-force on Dorade. 


IF 



“That’s Jogo,” said Chalmers 
sourly. “He’s getting too smart! We 
teach them to use clubs when they 
take the logs, if it’s necessary to 
subdue roots not firmly fixed. But 
he was going to club the tree for 
attacking his mate! That’s going too 
far!” 

The man from Earth stared at 
the quivering, almost-flaccid air- 
roots. 

“Is the tree dead?” 

“No,” said Chalmers annoyedly. 
“But he’ll kill it if he can.” 

The Home Office man said: 

“I’ll report this at the Home 
Office. They’ll probably issue some 
order to cover such matters.” 
“Yes,” said Chalmers sourly 
“They probably will!” 

He saw a crewman coming to re- 
port that the Corporation ship was 
ready to lift off. He turned toward 
the ship. 

He shook hands politely with the 
man from Earth before the ship 
lifted. He received the packet of 
orders it was then impossible to pro- 
test or criticize. Then he stood with 
the envelope in his hand and watch- 
ed the ship vanish in the sky. 

II 

I t seemed that nothing significant 
had taken place. But then Chal- 
mers read the new orders. 

He was not pleased. He went to 
show them to Burke, the breeding- 
master. On the way he passed by 
the stall assigned to Jogo and his 
mate Lily. 

They were inside, swaying back 
and forth and rumbling at each 


other, possibly discussing past events. 
Each had some broken-off thorns 
sticking in place. They rubbed them 
out against the stall-sides. It was 
painful. They probably agreed that 
Lily must be more careful here- 
after. There was a special reason for 
it just now. Jogo was extremely 
solicitous of Lily. He cherished every 
ounce of her very considerable 
poundage. 

Chalmers found Burke, the breed- 
ing-master. Burke had other duties, 
but the Corporation wanted more 
workers bred and conditioned, to be 
unable to imagine anything but obe- 
dience. It was Burke’s special job to 
meet that demand. 

“The Home Office,” Chalmers 
told him sourly, “wants more logs. 
We get one a day from each pair of 
forest-trained workers. They want 
us to get two.” 

Burke spat. 

“They asked for a report on that 
idea, last ship. I said it couldn’t be 
done. The workers’ve been taught 
that if they bring in one log today, 
they can go to their stalls and 
rumble to each other until tomor- 
row. They’re smart and they’re ob- 
stinate. Break that pattern and you 
won’t have trained animals. You’ll 
have wild ones. Worse, they’ll be 
educated wild ones! They’ll look on 
us as enemies because we confuse 
them. I told the Home Office so.” 

“You’re overruled,” said Chalm- 
ers. “The animal psychologists have 
figured out a trick. They say the 
workers loaf. The Home Office says 
they ought to bring in one log be- 
fore midday, and another at sun- 
down.” 


A PLANET LIKE HEAVEN 


115 



Burke stared. Chalmers read him 
tiie detailed instructions for getting 
the extra logs from the workers. 
There were alternative instructions 
for a scond method if the first did 
not prove desirable, but the require- 
ment for double production was ex- 
plicit. In re the first method, the 
orders said that chickens had been 
brought to double their e * produc- 
tion by a similar process. The fact 
that the Dorade workers weighed 
tons to chickens’ pounds shouldn’t 
make any difference. The workers 
should bring two logs per pair 
per day. 

B urke swore when Chalmers fin- 
ished. The workers were quite 
satisfactory as they were. They’d 
been captured, subdued, and brought 
to Dorade where they’d been trained 
to their work. They were docile 
enough, and even seemed friendly 
with men. So men who handled 
them felt some obligation to be kind 
to them. 

Actually, if they’d been only a 
little more brainy, they’d have been 
rated as rational animals and pro- 
tected by interstellar law against 
capture or enslavement. Now they 
had no rights any man was bound 
to respect. But they did have some 
qualities that men would be the 
better for having. 

Chalmers didn’t like the new or- 
ders. Nor did Burke. 

At sundown of the day after the 
Corporation ship’s departure the 
Forest workers began to appear at 
the edge of the enclosure. Jogo and 
Lily came out together, moving slow- 
ly and clumsily as usual. Jogo car- 

m 


ried a katnim log, balanced in bis 
trunk. He plodded ahead and LUy 
came dutifully after him. 

He neared the tree that had at- 
tacked Lily the day before. Hie put 
down the kamun log. He got a fresh 
grip on it. He advanced ominously 
upon the tree, the log held as a dub. 

Chalmers had anticipated it. He 
had a man posted to prevent it. That 
man used a sub-blaster. Jogo trum- 
peted in pained astonishment. The 
man burnt his hide again, shouting 
“Hup!” 

Jogo hesitated — and got a third 
sub-blaster shot. 

He subsided. He changed his grip 
on the log and resumed his plod- 
ding march to the place where logs 
should be delivered. Lily followed. 
Other workers delivered logs and 
went to their stalls. 

In the next two weeks, Jogo tried 
three times to destroy the tree on 
his way to the log-warehouse with a 
log. Each time he was burnt and 
shouted^ at. Each time Jogo obeyed. 

Then there were signs that an 
interesting event was at hand. Jogo 
and his mate — chained to two other 
workers — were transferred to a 
small, solid stockade and there re- 
leased. Instinct told Jogo what was 
about to happen. He became trucu- 
lent toward all living creatures ex- 
cept Lily. He patrolled the inside 
of the small stockade, prepared to 
battle to the death any creature who 
disturbed her. But there was no dis- 
turbance. 

Maybe Jogo was disappointed. It 
was all familiar enough, of course; 
there were other similar stockades. 
The only thing unusual was that 


IF 



while Jogo and Lily were in the 
maternity stockade, their own proper 
stall had alterations made in it. 

But eventually Chalmers was in- 
formed that the expected had hap- 
pened. 

He and Burke went up on 
the platform outside the stockade 
walls. They looked down at Lily and 
her big-eyed, clumsy offspring. 
Burke said: 

“He looks all right. In fifteen 
years he may be as big as his 
father.” 

“Maybe,” said Chalmers sourly. 
“But remember, the Home Office 
wants two logs per day from each 
pair of workers! And it’s to be tried 
out on a pair of new parents. One 
log at midday, and one at sundown. 
Then we make it general.” 

“You don’t try it on these for 
two weeks, anyhow,” said Burke 
firmly. “Four would be fairer. But 
not less than two.” 

‘The Home Office says as early 
as possible,” said Chalmers. “If you 
say it’s impossible for three, that 
goes.” 

They went down from the plat- 
form and went about their other 
duties. The Dorade Corporation was 
in existence to make money. Money 
could be made by the gathering of 
kamun logs, which grew only in one 
forest on one planet in the Galaxy. 
The more logs were secured, the 
greater the gross income of the Cor- 
poration. The lower the cost per 
log, the more profit for the Corpor- 
ation. The more work each non- 
human did, the better for everybody 
who owned stock. 

It was as simple as that. 


S o Jogo and Lily and their young 
one had just three weeks of 
simple family life before the exi- 
gencies of business began to affect 
them again. Then they were trans- 
ferred back to their old stall. 

There was usually some trouble 
attached to this re-transfer. This was 
the time when an infant worker was 
taken from its parents so its earliest 
memories could be controlled, and 
so k could never remember doing 
anything except what men wanted it 
to do. But right now the Corpora- 
tion wanted two logs per day from 
each pair of workers. 

So Jogo and Lily did not have 
the usual terrible, hopeless fight to 
try to keep their baby. That young 
creature followed its parents to their 
old home, frisking a little and with 
its little trunk dangling and useless 
and looking rather like a wet gray 
knitted stocking. 

They settled in their stall. There 
were some changes in it, but Jogo 
and Lily probably did not notice. 
They seemed glad to be at home 
again. 

They rumbled contentedly to each 
other, that first day. Maybe they 
were congratulating themselves on 
their return to their old stall and 
familiar routine. Naturally they 
didn’t guess that the new work- 
speedup system was to be begun 
next morning. 

Everything started off splendidly, 
though. Chalmers, frowning, watch- 
ed as Jogo and Lily came out of 
their stall with their infant frisking 
about their feet. Other workers went 
lumbering away through the trees. 
But Jogo hesitated because of his 


A PLANET LIKE HEAVEN 


117 



young s6n. He swayed undecidedly. 
He rumbled querulously. Then a 
man shouted “Hup!” and sunlight 
glinted on a sub-blaster. 

Jogo turned heavily and moved 
into the Forest like the rest. Lily 
followed, her infant gallantly trying 
to trot between them. He gazed at 
the strange new world with a charm- 
ed interest. 

They disappeared into the Forest. 
All seemed serene But half an hour 
later Chalmers heard distant noises 

Somehow he knew Jogo was in- 
volved. He made bellowing, infuriat- 
ed sounds He was fighting some- 
dung But Lily — Lily’s less deep- 
toned outcry was the frantic voice 
a i a mad creature defending her 
young. 

Chalmers looked ashamed. It did 
not seem to him that the orders he 
was carrying out were admirable. 

There was a battle royal being 
fought out in the Forest. Maybe it 
was one tree, or maybe two, fighting 
for the death of the infant worker, 
while Jogo and Lily fought for its 
life. At least once a full-grown 
worker had been killed by the trees 
It took three trees to do it, and one 
had lost half its air-roots in the 
conflict and the others were not un- 
harrr d, but still the worker had 
been killed. And a baby being 
fought over by its parents and by 
trees wasn’t in a particularly safe 
situation. Not when its parents 
weighed tons, like Jogo and Lily. 

So Chalmers listened to the dis- 
tant tumult with many disagreeable 
sensations. Half an hour later, when 
the noise was ended, he looked no 
■sore satisfied with himself. Because 

118 


logo and Lily, but no other work- 
ers, came back out of the Forest. 

They brought their offspring. And 
the two adults were striped and 
bloody where the thorny constrictor- 
roots had torn their hides. The 
young one was in much worse state. 
The red stripes on his body were 
deeper — his hide was not tough — 
and they crossed and criss-crossed 
each other all over him. He’d been 
seized by a tree. His parents had 
had to fight him free. He was in 
very bad shape. 

But Jogo didn’t bring a kamun- 
log for the warehouse. He’d led his 
mate and his son out of the Forest 
for safety, not bringing the log 
they’d been sent for. 

S o men drove them back in with 
sub-blasters. One does not ac- 
cept excuses from robots or domes- 
tic animals. They must obey orders 
or be destroyed or die. Jogo and 
his family could return to the safety 
of the warehouse-worker-stall area 
when they brought a kamun log, but 
not until then. 

They came back a second time 
near sundown. Jogo brought a log. 

The infant had some new stripes. 
Not many, but some. He was a piti- 
able, bleeding sight. Jogo and Lily 
went to where the log must be de- 
posited. Their small son stayed so 
close to them that he was in con- 
stant danger of being stepped on. 
His air was no longer valiant and 
frisky. He was dazed; shocked; stun- 
ned by the discovery of what life 
was really like. 

The two big workers made noises 
together for most of the dark hours 

IF 



in their stall. They definitely didn’t 
notice the changes that had been 
made in it — changes in the win- 
dows, and a solid door instead of 
the former massive grille. They 
seemed to talk about their situation 
in re their offspring. 

In the morning they were sent to 
the Forest again. The infant looked 
terrified, but he had to follow his 
mother. When the other forest- 
workers moved away, Jogo and his 
family followed. 

They came out half an hour be- 
fore midday. Jogo carried a kamun 
log. He and Lily did not want their 
infant in the Forest. They could not 
bring him out without also bringing 
a kamun log. So they’d gotten a log 
as quickly as they could, and 
brought their young one out te 
safety. 


Which was exactly what the ani- 
mal psychologists had predicted. The 
Home Office would be pleased. 

They went to their stall, having 
delivered the log. They rumbled con- 
gratulations to each other. Their 
three-week-old baby was safe in its 
parents’ stall again. 

Then there came darkness. 

Windows of the stall, which had 
been modified, now closed and let 
in no more light. The new solid door 
of the stall shut tightly. The interior 
of the stall became abysmally dark. 
There was no more light than at 
midnight. Less, in fact, because at 
midnight there were stars. 

Jogo made uneasy sounds in the 
blackness. He did not understand. 
Lily comforted her baby. The black- 
ness continued. 

Animal psychologists at the Home

Office had reasoned scientifically 
that the limited intelligence of the 
workers would not let them distin- 
guish between darkness and night. 
Chickens did not distinguish between 
fight and day. Lights were put on 
them during night. They thought 
new day had come, each time, and 
they had an extra activity-period 
during which they ate and laid eggs. 
The workers on Dorade should be 
equally unsophisticated. They should 
accept an hour of darkness as a 
night. They had an hqur of darkness. 

Then the windows opened and the 
solid door swung wide 

It had been predicted that Jogo 
and Lily would consider this a new 
day, in which by custom they should 
go out and get another kamun log. 
With each day divided into two in 
this fashion, they should carry out 
their routine twice instead of once 
The ofttput of kamun logs should be 
doubled with the same workforce 
and same investment and same ex- 
pense. Perhaps, eventually, three 
logs a day could be required of 
each worker-pair. Even four! The 
Corporation should profit hugely. 

But Jogo did not leave his stall. 
He didn’t verify the animal psychol- 
ogists’ predictions. He and Lily and 
their stumbling small calf stayed 
where they were. They appeared to 
converse contentedly, not under- 
standing the darkness just past, but 
placidly assuming that there would 
be no demands on them until a nor- 
mal dawning. 

But men drove them from the 
stall with sub-blaster burnings, de- 
spite logo’s and even Lily’s bewild- 
ered protests. 


Jogo argued querulously — it was 
clear that he argued — that the mat- 
ter should be talked over reason- 
ably; that it was patently unjust to 
demand more of them this day. If 
the men would think — 

But the men drove them out of 
their stall. They drove them into the 
Forest. In the Forest they kneW 
what they must do — bring back a 
kamun log. Their infant went with 
them in blind misery. There was 
nothing else for him to do. 

m 

T hey came back before sundown. 

Jogo brought a kamun log, his 
second for the day. The baby work- 
er was more pitiful than before. 
There’d been another battle in the 
Forest. 

Burke said between his teeth: 
“This is too much! He’ll die by 
inches!” 

Chalmers said curtly, “The ani- 
mal psychologists say Jogo and Lily 
will figure something out. Animals 
on Earth figure out ways to protect 
their young. Jogo will figure that 
he wants the baby safe back here. 
The only way to have him safe 
back here is to bring in a log. So 
he’ll do it. So we’ll chase him and 
Lily and the baby out to get an- 
other. And presently there’ll be or- 
ders to get three logs a day from 
him. Eventually, why not four?” 
Burke swore. 

“But meanwhile the young one 
will die by inches!” 

“And maybe Jogo,” said Chalm- 
ers distastefully. “And Lily. But the 
Home Office will change our orders 


120 


IF 



when the cash value of workers 
dying of this trick is greater than 
die cash value of the extra logs it 
brings. Enlightened self-interest!” 

He turned away. He was not 
pleased. He was subject to orders, 
too. 

Of course the workers weren’t 
human, but men who work with ani- 
mals often come to like them. Most 
animals have some admirable quali- 
ties some humans lack. But Chalm- 
ers was under contract. If he resign- 
ed before his contract ran out, he’d 
have to pay an exorbitant fare to 
get back to Earth. He’d lose his 
retirement pay. It would be ruinous* 
for him. The only way he could get 
out of obeying orders would be if 
the Corporation itself collapsed. But 
that was unthinkable! It paid divi- 
dends of three hundred twelve per 
cent per year! 

Next morning he drove himself to 
watch the workers move off into 
the forest. The other workers strag- 
gled away in twos. Jogo and Lily 
and their offspring marched off with 
something like a purposeful air. 
Then Chalmers went about his work, 
scowling and with one ear reluc- 
tantly cocked for noises from the 
Forest. He expected Jogo back be- 
fore eleven, with a kamun log. Then 
k would be Chalmers’ duty to give 
him an hour of darkness in his stall, 
and then send him out for another 
log. 

It was very probable that logo’s 
baby would acquire more slashes on 
his tender hide from the air-roots of 
a kamun tree, and that Jogo and 
Lily would also show signs of new 
combat. 


B ut Jogo wasn’t back at eleven. 

Or noon. Or one or two or 
three or four in Dorade’s afternoon. 

Chalmers remembered the worker 
who’d been killed by three trees to- 
gether. He’d seen the site of that 
killing from a copter, hovering aloft. 
It wasn’t a pretty sight. Now — 
He raged. He’d have to take a 
copter and find out what he’d done 
to Jogo and Lily and their offspring. 
It would be his fault. Jogo couldn’t 
imagine an abstraction like guilt, but 
Chalmers raged because he felt it. 

Then, at sundown. Jogo came out 
of the Forest. He carried a kamun 
log in his trunk. He had some new 
raw-flesh stripes on his hide. He’d 
fought something. 

But Lily showed no new wounds, 
nor did the baby. Jogo delivered his 
log and he and his family went 
contentedly to their stall. 

Chalmers regarded them with 
ironic satisfaction. 

“He fooled us,” he said curtly 
to Burke. “He parked Lily and the 
young one somewhere where there 
weren’t kamun trees. Then he went 
off by himself and got his log. He’s 
out-smarted us! He’s thumbing his 
trunk at me!” 

“Obey orders,” said Chalmers 
sourly. “Outsmart him back. I 
haven’t any choice!” 

Next morning, angrily, he gave 
the alternative orders, provided in 
case something unpredictable pre- 
vented the execution of the first. 
Jogo had prevented it. He mustn’t 
be allowed to make a custom of 
defiance or evasion. Even one case, 
repeated, could become a behavior- 
pattern. Chalmers had no choice 


A PLANET LIKE HEAVEN 


121 



Soon after sunrise he watched 
gloomily as the other workers am 
Wed ponderously off into the Forest. 
Then he had the door of logo’s stall 
opened. Jogo came out, and Lily . 
and then the door slammed shut 
again. 

The baby was still ins»de He 
bawled. Jogo protested. Lily was 
alarmed. 

“Hup!” snapped Chalmers angrily 
He was angry because he was 
ashamed. “Hup, Jogo! Hup!” 

Jogo protested again. Lily whim- 
pered. 

Chalmers used the sub-blaster on 
them. Jogo and Lily continued to 
protest. They were bewildered. They 
wanted their small offspring with 
them. Chalmers used the sub-blaster 
ruthlessly. There were other men 
he could have ordered to do the 
dirty work, but he despised what he 
was doing, so he did it all himself 

H e drove Jogo and Lily into the 
Forest, leaving their young one 
bawling behind. It was only possible 
because they were tamed. 

Men did not injure Jogo or Lily 
in ways that they could understand 
to be injuries. Men had been about 
the baby worker and had not harm- 
ed it, as Jogo and Lily understood 
such things. Jogo couldn’t grasp the 
connection between men and kamun 
trees, so he couldn’t feel that men 
were enemies. When the baby was 
first born — yes. He’d have fought 
men then. But not now. 

So it was possible for Chalmers to 
drive them away. When they did 
disappear in the foliage of the For- 
est, looking back plaintively, Chalm- 


ers scowled and his fifps were a tigfr « 
line. 

“I suppose,” said Burke painfully, 
“you had to do it.” 

“I did!” snapped Chalmers. 'They 
want to get back to their baby. They 
know they can’t come back without 
a log. So they’ll get a log and come 
back as quickly as they can!” 

He went stamping into bis office. 
Jogo’s and Lily’s childbeast bawled 
hysterically. It was a distressful 
sound. 

Jogo and Lily were back within 
an hour. They brought a kamun log. 
There was foliage on it. They’d 
attacked the first kamun tree they 
found, using no discrimination. They 
didn’t hunt for a tree at the proper 
stage of development, with its leaves 
dropped and its air-roots’ free ends 
burrowed into the ground to form 
soil-roots and become new trees, hi 
their desperation they’d attacked a 
tree with its air-roots still active and 
deadly. Undoubtedly they’d had to 
tear them off to get at the unripe 
log they belonged to. 

Jogo was a grisly sight, bleeding 
from new wounds. Lily was no less 
a spectacle to make angels weep 

But Jogo had brought back a log. 
With foliage on it. Which meant 
that it had been taken when it had 
no commercial value, and moreover 
that a certain number of prospective 
kamun trees had been destroyed. 
The torn-off air-roots would never 
develop into new monstrous kamun 
trees. 

Chalmers regarded them. The 
Home Office considered 4hat if the 
workers were made desperate, they 
would bring in more logs. But, made 


122 


V 



desperate, they killed trees to bring 

in useless logs. 

Chalmers swore a little for the 
look of it, but he felt a private 
sense of relief. 

“Let the young one out,” he com- 
manded sourly. “They win! Let ’em 
go in their stall if they want to.” 

But they didn’t want to. The 
young one, released by the opening 
of the door, went straight as a bullet 
to his mother. And Jogo and Lily 
fondled him excessively, grumbling 
and rumbling affectionately Some 
red stuff came off on the infant. 
Blood. 

And suddenly they went off into 
the Forest with their young one be- 
tween them. 

IV 

T hey came back at sundown. 

Jogo brought another kamun 
log, properly collected at the proper 
state of leaflessness. 

The next day he brought another. 
At sundown. And it was necessary 
to let things go on in this new pat- 
tern. because if the baby were taken 
from them now, they might become 
desperate again and kill valuable 
trees in their need to ransom the 
small image that now stayed very, 
very close to its mother in the For- 
est. 

Burke very unhappily pointed out 
that the Home Office would not be 
satisfied with a single experiment. 
To prevent demands for its repeti- 
tion on a new and larger and more 
revolting scale, they’d better repeat 
it themselves. Chalmers nodded. 
“Surely we’ve got to try it twice,” 


he said defensively. “The Home Of- 
fice believes in animal psychology. 
It believes all beasts are alike except 
when they contradict animal psy- 
chology. So we’ve got to prove that 
they’re all alike in contradicting 
animal psychology . but you try 
it this time.” 

Burke grimaced. He didn’t like 
that idea, either. 

But doggedly he went through the 
experiment again. There was another 
worker-couple in a maternity stock- 
ade, and their small female young 
one was nearing three weeks of age. 
The names of this other couple, on 
the Corporation’s books, were Maco 
and Alice. They were sent into the 
Forest with their frisking, infantile 
calf. They decided it was not safe 
for their infant. They came back, 
without a kamun log. They tried to 
return. They were driven back with 
sub-blaster shots. 

They came back at sundown with 
a log. They had to fight for their 
young one. 

The next day they were sent out 
again. They came back by midday, 
with a log. They went into their stall 
and darkness fell upon them. When 
light came again they were bewilder- 
ed by the demand that they go again 
into the forest. But they were driven 
into it and came back with a second 
log for that day. 

But the day after, they apparently 
made contact with Jogo and Lily. 
They didn’t come back until sunset. 
Then the two pairs of parents came 
lumbering home to their stalls with 
their infants frisking together. 

The two mothers had obviously 
joined forces to protect their infants. 


A PLANET LIKE HEAVEN 


123 



and the two bulls had gone off to- 
gether to gather their logs. It was a 
beautiful frustration of the plans 
laid by animal psychologists. Burke 
surrendered relievedly. The two in- 
fants were left with their parents 
lest new active-state kamun trees be 
destroyed uselessly by workers des- 
perate to haVe their offspring with 
them. 

“Somebody,” said Burke, obscure- 
ly cheered, “is going to have his 
ears pinned back. But I’ll bet we get 
crazier and crazier orders until some 
ammal psychologist gets fired!” 

“Or until we’re fired,” said 
Chalmers. 

B ut he viewed that possibility 
without alarm. He was under 
contract to the Corporation. Unless 
for proven incompetence or disloyal- 
ty. he couldn’t be fired without a 
settlement that would leave him free 
to do as he pleased all the rest of 
his life. He wouldn’t mind that at 
all! He settled back to wait for the 
next Corporation ship. 

Meanwhile everything went along 
beautifully. Each day at sunrise the 
shambling great beasts which were 
the workers went ponderously into 
the Forest. At sundown they return- 
ed to the warehouse and the stalls, 
one of each two bringing a kamun 
log. The normal quota of logs was 
coming in. But no extras. 

Then the Corporation ship arriv- 
ed. 

It brought another man from the 
Home Office. This time it was no 
less than the President of the Do- 
rade Corporation. He’d caused the 
new work-load raise to be ordered. 


and he came happily to see the 
working-out of a scheme that should 
increase the Corporation’s dividend 
rate from three hundred odd per 
cent to more than six hundred. 

But he found matters going on as 
if the orders hadn’t been issued — 
except that Jogo and Lily, and Maco 
and Alice, took young offspring with 
them into the Forest every day. He 
demanded explanations. He didn’t 
find them satisfactory. 

“But what do the damned work- 
ers do with their time?” he asked 
fretfully. “You’ve proved they can 
bring in two logs a day! Whv don’t 
they? What do they do?” Then he 
said: “Get out a copter. I’ll look 
into this myself!” 

Chalmers was appalled. But he 
piloted the copter in which the Pres- 
ident surveyed the Forest. After 
some time he found the worker' . 
He realized instantly what had hap 
pened. In the same instant he knew 
the President would never under- 
stand. 

He told Burke about it later. 

“I found ’em over by a ford in 
the stream that runs through the 
Forest. Remember we had trouble 
setting up the electrified fence there 
without grounding it? They were in 
a couple of groups of some dozens 
each. They were feeding, and doz- 
ing, and bathing in the river. They 
were acting the way their ancestors 
did for millions of years, not even 
thinking about work? But come sun- 
down they came back to their stalls. 
It’s habit. They brings logs. That’s 
habit, too. But they’ve gone back 
to the social system — the herd — 
that's instinctive with them!” 


124 


IF 



B urke blinked at him. He’d heard 
the President bellowing as he 
got out of the copter. In fact, he 
was bellowing now. 

“It’s the young ones,” said 
Chalmers, with a sort of guilty zest 
“Sending them into the Forest — 
with kamun trees — is what did it. 
Adults sent to do work are just 
adults sent to do work. But two 
adults and a baby are a family. 
Two families are the beginning of 
a herd! You see? You can’t have a 
herd from a group of adults only. 
You don’t have workers if you have 
a herd. Orders from the Home Of* 
fice made us send the young ones 
in. With no humans in the Forest to 
boss them, they began to hang 
around together. Now they’re a 
herd. They’re acting as their fore- 
bearers have done for ten thousand 
generations! They still have the habit 
of bringing logs and sleeping in 
stalls, but they can be independent 
of us any time they like!” 

Burke’s mouth had dropped open. 
Now he closed it. 

“We’ll have to re-train all of 
them,” he said helplessly. “That’s 
going to be the hell of a job!” 
Chalmers shook his head. He 
paused for a moment, listening to 
the President’s voice, roaring at the 
other human employees of the Do- 
rade Corporation. 

“Not us,” said Chalmers. “The 
Home Office has taken over. The 
President, no less. We’re relieved. 
He’s going to straighten things out. 
Want to know how? The workers 
are to be driven to work and back 
again to their stalls by copters. The 
men in the copters will use sub- 


blasters and shout ‘Hup!* from the 
sky. They’ll drive the workers to 
where they can get their kamun 
logs, and then they’ll drive them 
back to the warehouse with them, 
and then back for more logs 
Two, three, four a day per work- 
er!” 

“He’s crazy!” said Burke. “He’s 
going to try to make them work! 
And animals don’t understand work- 
ing! They understand a ritual, but 
they don’t understand a job! We 
had ’em going through a ritual, and 
that was all right, but they’ll never 
understand what he wants. They’ll 
panic!” 

Chalmers said pleasantly: 

“I’ye another item. He didn’t see 
it. He was too busy seeing red be- 
cause the workers were bathing and 
loafing — but I saw where a work- 
er happened to get near a kamun 
tree. Naturally, it grabbed him. He 
fought it, and the herd saw it, and 
they closed in and tore that kamun 
tree to bits.” 

Burke fairly jerked himself up- 
right. 

“But — that means as a herd 
they’ll class kamun trees as enemies 
— as they might class snakes — or 
tigers. Enemies! They’ll kill every 
kamun tree they see.” 

“Which,” said Chalmers comfort- 
ably, “is no longer our business. The 
Home Office has taken charge. The 
President is ordering out the copters 
now. They’ll start chasing the work- 
ers back and forth with sub- blaster 
shots and shouting from the sky The 
workers will get confused. They’ll 
panic. They’ll stampede. How long 
before they crash the electric fence

Burke’s mouth opened and closed

"We’re not responsible for the re-

Dorade, on Earth. It was years and 
years before Chalmers saw a single 
item about the planet or the tiny 
colony he’d run there. Then that 
item was very brief indeed. It said 
that somebody’s space-yacht had 
landed on a planet called Dorade, 
and found it inexplicably inhabited 
by animals obviously introduced 
from Earth. They were numerous 
and thriving and very evidently hap-

THE SMALLNESS 
BEYOND THOUGHT 

by ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 


I 

C arrying shelter halves and sleep- 
ing bags, each with a head-high 
staff and each with a little food in 
his pack, the two youths had worked 
their way up the canyon since early 
morning. Their clothing was spotless, 
their equipment included a compass, 
a scout knife, a canteen, and — spe- 
cial for this region — two packs of 


Illustrated by GAUGHAN 


The mountain was deadly and th 
hermit was dearly insane. 8 
Earth's future depended on the 


anti-rattlesnake venom. Since they 
belonged to the newly organized 
Space Scouts, their equipment also 
included an excellent map of the 
night sky for the month of July. 

Each carried a small collecting 
sack. As they had come up the can- 
yon each had picked up bright frag- 
ments of float quartz and other shiny 
stones. 

“There’s something, Jimbo,” Bruce 


127 



said, pointing with his staff toward 
the base of a nearby cliff. There a 
vertical stringer of rose quartz had 
intruded into the granite that form- 
ed the main rock mass of this re- 
gion. Moving to the stringer, Bruce 
dropped on one knee to examine it 
better. Excitement lit his finely chis- 
eled face. Quickly, he found a chunk 
of granite, used it to break off a 
larger piece of quartz, which he held 
up to the sun. 

“ Get the ethen, Jimbo!” he said. 

J imbo, the shorter of the two, had 
already taken a small metal 
case from his pack. Opening the 
case revealed a transparent plastic 
cube inside it. With his scout knife, 
Jimbo cut a small limb from a wild 
buckwheat bush. Splitting the end 
of the limb, he inserted a fragment 
of crystal from the stringer into it. 
Using the limb of buckwheat to 
keep his hand at least 18 inches 
away from the little plastic cube, 
he brought the quartz crystal near- 
er and nearer. From the bottom of 
the cube, a little ball suddenly cairfe 
to life. It leaped upward, then took 
on an orbital motion, then began to 
spin on its own axis. Slowly, Jimbo 
brought the fragment of quartz cry- 
stal closer to the transparent cube. 
When it was about three inches 
away, the spinning ball inside the 
cube suddenly began to emit smoke. 
Jimbo hastily jerked the crystal 
away. 

Without a word, both boys dump- 
ed from the sacks the mineral speci- 
mens they had gathered on the hot 
trip up the waterless canyon. Each 
sack was filled again, this time with 


fragments of quartz chipped from 
the stringer rising through the gran- 
ite. When they had filled the bags, 
Bruce, estimating time by looking at 
the sun, consulted a map of the re- 
gion. 

“According to this map, the place 
called Hermit’s Canyon is not more 
than half a mile from here.” 

“We can make it easily before 
night,” Jimbo answered. Replacing 
in its metal case the transparent cube 
that contained the little ball, he slip- 
ped the metal case carefully into 
his knapsack. As the two youths 
went quickly up the rugged canyon, 
they looked a little like young, thin- 
waisted hunting dogs on the trail of 
ancient prey. 

n 

I t had been said of the man called 
the hermit that he had come up 
here into these desert mountains to 
die. Back in the days when land was 
cheap in California, he had bought 
a few acres on the bottom of the 
canyon, and more acres on the small, 
rocky plateau above the canyon. In 
the canyon, he had built a shack of 
wood and of boulders, he had also 
built stone steps to reach the pla- 
teau above. But the structure that 
had excited comment was an aim- 
less, wandering, going no-where 
foundation for an incredible house 
that he built beside the canyon road 
— and which he kept on building 
across many years, so many that the 
people who had first said he had 
come up here to die had died them- 
selves. 

In the early days, the road that 


128 


IF 



ran down the canyon had been 
strictly a horse and wagon trail. It 
had originally been built by Indian 
labor doing slave time for a Spanish 
grandee who had held these desert 
mountains under a grant from the 
king of Spain. It nad been intended 
for the use of mules drawing carts 
and for the grandee’s Arabian 
horses. After the grandee had gone 
and his 20,000 acre ranch had pass- 
ed into the hands of the newly ar- 
rived Americans, the road had been 
improved enough to allow broad- 
tired wagons to creep along it. Herds 
of steers and flocks of sheep had 
also used this trail. Rattlesnakes, 
then and now, had left broad twist- 
ed trails in its dust. 

Hardly anyone knew when the 
hermit had first arrived. No one 
cared. The report was promptly 
passed along the scattered ranches 
that he was crazy. People left him 
alone. Few people had ever seen 
die overall clad, long-haired, bare- 
footed, brown-skinned recluse who 
had found refuge here. He had a 
car, an old model Ford, which he 
repaired himself. Because he rarely 
went to town, people wondered how 
he lived. Finally most decided that 
he grew his own food in the can- 
yon. It was certain he had planted 
avacado, English walnut, and orange 
trees in the canyon. On the plateau, 
he had built some kind of structure, 
no one knew exactly what. No one 
cared to go to the trouble to find 
out. In the first place, the struc- 
ture — whatever ft was — was on 
the hermit’s land. To reach it, tres- 
pass would be necessary. No one 
knew whether or not the hermit had 


a rifle, but in this country everyone 
eke did, so the assumption was that 
the hermit had a gun too, and 
could probably use it. There were 
other reasons for not investigating 
the structure on the plateau, one 
being that the plateau was known 
to be arid, rocky soil where nothing 
but sage brush, cactus, and wild 
buckwheat would grow, another be- 
ing that the place had a reputation 
for being much to well supplied with 
rattlesnakes. 

W hen the sixties had come and 
light planes had become fairly 
common, one local rancher, mildly 
curious, had flown his plane over 
the plateau. Later, when he had 
been released from the hospital after 
a crash that had broken both legs 
and several ribs, he had said that all 
he had seen on top of the plateau 
had been a circular pit of some 
kind. “Covered with wires,” the 
rancher had said. No, he had seen 
nobody on the plateau and he hadn’t 
been shot at. His motor had simply 
conked out over the plateau and he 
had to make an emergency landing, 
which had wrecked his plane and 
had almost wrecked him. 

But the real reason no one cared 
about the structure on top of the 
plateau was because everyone 
thought it was similar to the struc- 
ture he had erected beside the road 
at the bottom of the canyon. Any- 
one who drove along the road could 
see this structure. And seeing it, 
could be sure it had been built by 
a madman, and that no matter what 
this madman built, it would have 
no significance. 


THE SHALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


129 




No one who had seen this struc- 
ture beside the road at the bottom 
of the canyon had been able to dis- 
cern its purpose or its plan. It was 
a house, or the foundation of a 
house, it was the foundation of a 
house that had burned — only no 
house had ever been built on this 
foundation. Nor could one ever be 
built here, neither of wood nor stone 
nor brick, not only because the 
foundation ran at crazy angles but 
also because the foundation was not 
strong enough to support a structure 
above it. What was it? Nobody knew. 

It was made of rough stone pick- 
ed up in the canyon, everybody was 
sure of this much though not of 
much more. Here a huge fireplace 
rose from the ground, only it wasn’t 
a fireplace because the chimney 
closed in tight above it, also because 










the fire box had been turned into a 
flower box. Who would grow flow- 
ers in a fireplace except a madman? 
Also, around the outer area, was a 
stone wall that contained all the 
other walls. Here rose an arch for a 
door, but there was no door. Here 
was a place that looked as if it would 
form a quiet pool if water was to 
flow along these channels only there 
was no water to flow. Here a path 
made of fitted stone led to the base 
of a tall tree to stop there as if it 
had gone as far as had been plan- 
ned. Only who would run a path 
from a house to a tree? Here be- 
side the path were pools that look- 
ed like they were supposed to be fish 
ponds, only they had no water in 
them, and no fish. Here on tall 
arches was a stone aqueduct that 
looked lik$ the aqueducts the Ro- 


mans had built in Italy so long ago. 
Only this aqueduct was not five 
feet high, not ten feet long, it did 
not start at any water supply, it did 
not carry water and never had. 

T he whole damned structure was 
mad, according to the residents 
of this region. It was completely out 
of place. Or perhaps it was out of 
time. The best that anybody had 
ever said for the hermit was that he 
had seemed to select small segments 
from many structures that had once 
existed in other times and in other 
places and had tried to put them 
together into one building. 

The hermit didn’t care what peo- 
ple thought. He went his solitary 
way, living alone in the shack of 
logs and stone he had built in the 
canyon. He seemed to have enough 


THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


131 



money for gasoline and tools and 
cement and he didn’t need much 
else. People took one look into the 
old Ford and stayed away from it 
thereafter. Coiled on the front seat 
was always a big gopher snake. The 
hermit and the snake seemed to be 
quite friendly and the hermit was 
not the only person to make a pet 
out of a snake and while a gopher 
snake is about as harmless a crea- 
ture as crawls the earth — except to 
gophers, of course — the rumor got 
around that this was a pet rattle- 
snake the hermit carried around with 
him in his old car. 

After that, even the hitchhikers 
avoided him. 

There are people in the world, 
plenty of them, who will look at a 
gopher snake and will see a big red 
rattler and will boast for years there- 
after how close they were to the 
big snake. 

Then, after World War II ended 
and after the uneasy peace came 
over the world, the big 200 inch 
eye that looks out yonder . and 
out yonder . and still farther out 
yonder ... to where the galaxies 
look like tops set 'spinning by care- 
less children of the gods . who 
thereafter forgot about their toys 
and left them to spin on forever in 
Great Space ... the big 200 inch 
eye in the sky was set into place 
on top of the mountain that looked 
down over the vast number of ra- 
vines and lonely plateaus where the 
hermit lived. Not that the big scope 
would ever be used to look down, 
his throat. Its focus was so long it 
could see a million light years but 
It couldn’t see five miles down into 


the canyons. 

Certainly die hermit must have 
seen the big scope going into its 
shining dome on the rim of the 
mountain above him. He must have 
seen the special road ripped out of 
the mountain to carry the giant 
trucks that carried girders for the 
dome, also that great truck that car- 
ried the big lens up the mountain. 
If so, he paid no attention. 

B ut later, when the sixties • were 
fading away, he seemed to take 
interest in tfie radio telescope then 
going in on the rim of the moun- 
tain above his plateau. He inquired 
about it at the general store and sa- 
loon at the base of the mountain 
where the scope was located. He 
went to the local library in the near- 
est town and studied newspapers 
containing the story of the radio 
telescope. 

“Its purpose is to listen for foot- 
falls in space,” some reporter wrote 
about it. Another called it the big 
ear and said it could detect a gnat 
walking on the edge of the Milky 
Way. 

For one week, exactly, the radio 
telescope listened to the noise com- 
ing from out yonder, to the radio 
waves hinting that stars were being 
born, or nova exploding, of electric 
storms sweeping across the void. 
Perhaps the staff of the big ear were 
trying to detect' the whisper of feet 
coming from the direction of the 
great suns of space. Were strangely 
shaped flying machines wandering 
there? Did definitely recognizable 
radio signals come in from the void? 
Marconi had thought he had picked 


132 


IF 



up radio signals from space. Other, 
less famous men in the field of 
radio, had made similar claims. Dur- 
ing the week that the scope was 
working perfectly. Dr. James Kirk, 
director of the whole project, and 
Ed Quimby, electronic specialist in 
charge of the radio end of the big 
scope, were happy men. 

The first day the radio telescope 
was put into operation, the hermit 
visited it. And Ed Quimby met him, 
talked to him, liked him. Only 
Quimby didn’t know who he was. 
And wouldn’t have cared if he had 
known. Quimby had left the build- 
ing and had gone out to his car to 
get a carton of cigarettes. Puffing 
and snorting steam, an ancient car 
was just pulling into the parking 
space next to Quimby’s car. 

Glancing at the driver, Quimby 
saw what seemed to be an old and 
yet somehow a young man. High 
cheek bones were prominent under 
the dark skin of a smoothly shaven 
face. Quimby’s first thought was that 
the driver was an Indian, possibly 
from one of the reservations in the 
vicinity. Then he saw the man’s 
eyes. They were the color of space 
as seen from the top of this moun- 
tain, 

But even with eyes-4he color of 
space, Quimby paid slight attention 
to the man. It was the old car that 
grabbed and held his attention. 
Quimby w£s not a rebuilder of an- 
tique cars, he simply admired them. 
He saw that this was a Model A 
Ford, which dated it as being built 
prior to the early 1930’s. In spite 
of its age, it had gotten up the 
mountain. Quimby spoke admiring- 

THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


ly of this feat. 

Perhaps the hermit was lonely, 
perhaps he felt an urge to talk to 
somebody, perhaps he misunderstood 
Quimby’s admiration for the car as 
friendliness, perhaps this gave him 
the opening he wanted. He began to 
talk, eagerly, about the strengths of 
the Model A. 

Ill 

4 tT rebuild it myself every spring,” 
J. the hermit said, enthusiasti- 
cally. “Put in new rings, take up 
bearings. Keep full of oil, it run 
long, long time.” 

This was what Quimby thought 
the hermit said, this was the way 
Ed translated the words. Neither 
then nor at any other time was he 
ever quite sure what this man said. 
The hermit spoke with an accent, 
sometimes he put the verb at the 
head of the sentence, sometimes he 
tacked it on at the end of a sentence 
— like a caboose on a long railroad 
train — sometimes he forgot the 
verb entirely, sometimes he used 
nothing but verbs, leaving the nouns 
to find their way home as best they 
could. The result was enormous 
verbal confusion but the hermit 
grinned at the electronics engineer 
and Quimby grinned back. No lan- 
guage barrier has as yet come into 
existence that will stand up against 
simple good will, with the result 
that within one minute these two 
men were firm friends and were 
deep in a highly technical discussion 
of internal engines. 

Then the hermit pointed at the 
antennae of the radio telescope that 

133 



Mad been built to listen tor footfalls 
In space. At this time, it was official 
policy to show every possible cour- 
tesy to visiting natives, with the re- 
mit that Quimby took the man 
through the whole set-up, even intro- 
ducing him to Dr ' James Kirk. Po- 
itely, Kirk and the hermit shook 
hands, and Quimby continued the 
tour. The hermit stared in wonder- 
ing awe at the antennae systems, he 
studied the amplifying and recording 
devices with what seemed to be an 
expert eye. When they had finished 
die tour, he was calling Quimby by 
his first name, which was Ed, except 
that when the hermit spoke the 
word, it came out Edyn, except 
when it came out Den. Once or 
twice it came out Ned. And Quimby 
was calling his visitor Hermit. 

Outside, Hermit took Quimby to 
the edge of the mountain and 
pointed downward to the complex 
of alternating canyons and plateaus, 
Indicating the canyon where he liv- 
ed. At the car, they shook hands. 

“Edyn, thank you, I wish ... Is 
good for . Is good to ... I mean. 
Great is You come see me, could 
he, huh, Ned?” 

He pointed at the canyon where 
he lived. 

“Glad to, Hermit,” Quimby an- 
swered. 

Then he looked inside the car 
and saw the tame gopher snake 
asleep on the front seat and sud- 
denly decided he would not accept 
tfris invitation. The hermit got into 
the car beside the snake. Waving 
hack at Quimby, he drove away. 
Quimby, his mouth open because of 
flie snake, stood staring after him. 


C ompleted, the big ear listened for 
one week for footfalls out in 
the far-off galaxies where the big 
suns go Then it stopped listening. 
This was a new type radioscope, 
with new circuits built on new con- 
cepts that nobody understood very 
well. The staff, driven by Kirk and 
Quimby, spent a frantic month try- 
ing to get the big ear back on the 
job of listening. They had no luck. 
Worst of all, they could not under- 
stand what was happening except 
that somewhere the current was not 
flowing. Just as Ed Quimby was 
about to blow his stack, one of the 
staff told him that a crazy man who 
couldn’t talk was outside asking for 
him. Quimby went out. The visitor 
was the hermit. Quimby invited him 
into the lab. In exactly 18 minutes, 
the hermit had isolated the break in 
a series of wires, said break being 
very completely hidden by insulation 
and moulding, which was stopping 
the current flow. He established 
wired circuits around the break and 
put the scope back into operation. 
Any member of the staff, with a 
good meter, could have found this 
hidden break, if they had thought to 
check for it. They hadn’t thought. 
How had the hermit found it? 

The staff asked questions. Dr. 
Kirk boomed questions at him. He 
stared blankly at all of them. Quim- 
by tried to translate. 

“Feelin’ jumps no go,” the hermit 
said, grinning happily at his friend. 

Eventually his friend Quimby, 
prodded by the .director and the 
whole staff, managed to translate 
these noises into words. 


134 


IF 



“As I understand him, he says he 
can feel with his fingers the flow of 
electromagnetic radiation,” Quimby 
told the staff. 

They hit him with everything but 
the roof. 

“I don’t claim that I can do it,” 
Quimby said, patiently. “But he 
claims he can feel radio waves with 
his fingers.” 

“Can he feel them in space or in 
wires?” Kirk asked. 

“Either way,” Quimby answered. 
At the moment, the hermit’s triple 
talk consisted of all nouns and no 
verbs. 

“All right, we’ll check him on 
that,” Kirk said. 

This laboratory was staffed by 
hard-bitten radio engineers who 
knew, or thought they knew, every- 
thing there was to know about radio 
waves. They already had the equip- 
ment, hence they needed perhaps 
five minutes to set up a small radio 
transmitter in such a way that its 
output was fed into an insulated 
wire, which was passed around the 
corner of a door and into a second 
room where the hermit could not 
see what was being done at the 
transmitter. 

“When I say now ask him to tell 
you whether or not radio waves are 
flowing in the wire,” Kirk said 

I n the first room, where no one 
could see him, the director push- 
ed — or did not push — a silent 
switch. 

“Now!" 

In the second room, the hermit 
held tentative fingers toward the 
wire that was serving as a radiator 

THE SHALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


— and broke into excited speech. 

“He says that radio wires are 
flowing in the wire — ” Quimby be- 
gan. 

“Hah!” Kirk grunted from the 
next room. “The switch was open. 
How could the wire be acting as a 
radiator?” 

“ — but that radio waves are al- 
ways flowing in every piece of wire 
of every length,” Quimby continued. 
“He says no waves were coming 
from your transmitter at the time 
you spoke. Sender-outer, he calls it.” 

In the next room was puzzled, 
angry silence. 

“Now!” Kirk said again, his voice 
hot. 

The hermit reached exploring fin- 
gers toward the wire — and shook 
his head. 

“No,” Quimby said. 

“Now!” Kirk shouted. 

“No, Edyn,” the hermit said. 

“Now!" Kirk screamed. 

“Yes,” the hermit said, grinning 
happily 

Kirk came into the second room. 
His face was grim. “That might 
have been a coincidence, a lucky 
guess — ” 

“Let’s run more tests,” Quimby 
said. 

Thirty minutes later, every hard- 
boiled radio engineer in the lab was 
convinced that the hermit could feel 
the flow of radio waves along a 
wire. He did not miss even one test. 
Kirk was puzzled, grim, perhaps 
bitter. They set up a second test, 
one in which the energy was pro- 
jected in a tight, invisible beam. 

The absence of wires made no 
difference to this ragged, blue-eyed 

j35 



scarecrow from one of the canyons 
below the mountain Again he was 
right every time. 

At this point, Kirk, now growing 
desperate, suggested that possibly 
the ragged man was reading his 
mind. 

“Reading your mind would be an 
even more remarkable feat than 
sensing radio waves with his fin- 
gers,” Quimby said. 

“We’ll test it anyhow.” 

To devise and set up a test sys- 
tem wasn’t difficult for these people 
The device consisted of a circular 
drum much like the channel selector 
on a TV set, the drum containing 
multiple contacts, the drum being 
hidden in a box. Set spinning, the 
drum was like a miniature roulette 
wheel. No one knew where it was 
going to stop or where it had stop- 
ped after it had finished turning. 
Perhaps it had closed a contact 
which fed current to a transmitter, 
perhaps it had not. 

A gain the hermit reported on the 
existence or the non-existence 
of radio waves, only now there was 
no mind to read from which to 
secure the information. Nobody 
knew where the selector had stop- 
ped. 

Nobody but the hermit. This 
bare-footed scarecrow from the can- 
yon below the mountain knew 
whether or not the transmitter was 
turned on, knew it every time. 

By the time this test was finished, 
the atmosphere in this mile-high ra- 
dio telescope laboratory was begin- 
ning to develop considerable electric 
tension all its own. This was put 


down to nerves, to the emotional 
reaction of shaken men who had 
seen what they did not understand 
and what they had thought could 
not happen. 

At this point, the hermit decided 
it was time for him to go. Spouting 
verbs at Ed Quimby, he started to- 
ward the door. 

“Hold up there!” Dr Kirk called 
to him. “I want to talk to you. I’ve 
got questions . .” 

Possibly the bare-footed scarecrow 
from the canyons below did not un- 
derstand the direction, possibly he 
understood and chose to do as he 
wished. Waving happily at his friend, 
Quimby, he went through the door. 

Kirk punched the intercom and 
told the uniformed guard now on 
duty at the outer exit from the lab 



136 


IF 



Later, the guard said: “I told him 
you wanted to talk to him but he 
kept right on walking. Sure, I tried 
to stop him. What happened to me? 
How’d I get down here in the dis- 
pensary? Why am I lying down? 
What makes my head buzz this 
way?” 

“Where did the hermit go?” Kirk 
asked the guard. 

“How in hell would I know? How 
did I get here — ” 

Kirk got on the telephone and 
identified himself to the office of 
the state police. He spoke to the 
Desk Sergeant. 

“A barefooted man in a Model A 
coming down Telescope Mountain? 
He’ll be easy to identify? You want 
him picked up on a charge of as- 
saulting a guard at the radio tele- 
scope laboratory? Yes, sir, we’ll pick 


him up. No, we won’t let him get 
away. There’s only one road down 
the mountain. We’ll pick him up 
close to the bottom . .” 

In the hospital, the state trooper 
said: 

“I had an order to stop this 
old model car, see? The driver was 
to be held for questioning, see? An 
assault charge, see? I parked my 
patrol car off the highway so I 
could drop in behind him as soon 
as he passed me, see? He came rat- 
tling by my stake-out. I pulled in 
behind and gave him the red light, 
see? He turned around and looked 
at me. I thought he pointed his fin- 
ger at me, sort of waggling it at me 
the way you do to a kid . see? 
. How’d I get in the hospital? 
What happened? Did I go off the 
road?” 


THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


137 



A t noon the next day, Dr. Kirk 
called Ed Quimby into his of- 
fice. The director had a report from 
the state police on his desk. “So 
you think the hermit feels friendly 
to you, do you, Ed?” he asked. 

“I think so,” Quimby answered. 
“All right,” the director contin- 
ued. “Because he feels friendly to- 
ward you, I want you to go down 
and find him. Make good friends 
with him. Find out where he lives, 
visit him in his home even if it is a 
cave!” 

Bitterness crept into the direc- 
tor’s voice as he spoke these 
words. 

“Sure,” Quimby answered. “If that 
is my duty assignment, I’ll be glad 
to go down and hunt him up. But 
if there are legal charges against 
him, he may not let me get very 
close to him.” 

“There are no legal charges 
against him,” Kirk said. 

“Eh? What about that?” Quimby 
pointed to the report on the direc- 
tor’s desk. 

“This is a report, nothing more. 
If there were a way to file charges 
against him, I would certainly do 
it, just to talk to him if for no other 
reason!” The bitterness strengthened 
in Kirk’s voice. “But our guard here 
is all right. Nobody knows what 
happened to him, except he let the 
hermit walk off the premises. As to 
the state trooper, all anybody can 
say is that he ran off the road and 
parked his patrol car at the bottom 
of the ravine. The hermit may have 
knocked out both of these men, 
with some kind of electrical energy 
spurting from his fingers, but 


there’s absolutely nothing we can do 
about it because we can’t prove the 
existence of such an energy! Also, 
to attempt to prove it is to get me 
fired, as incompetent. In fact, I 
could be fired for thinking such 
thoughts, even!” 

The director wiped sweat from 
his bald head. “Damnit, Ed. it’s 
maddening enough to be responsible 
for a radio telescope listening for 
footfalls in space. God knows, what 
would be up that way — ” he point- 
ed toward the ceiling, “ — that would 
have feet? Then, while I’m listen- 
ing for the impossible, the incredible 
comes walking through the front 
door, and — ” 

“I know how it is,” Quimby said. 
“It gets to me too, sometimes.” He 
shook his head. “All right. I’ll go 
down and find the hermit and see 
what I can get out of him.” 

“Please do, Ed,” the director beg- 
ged. 

IV 

Q uimby’s first stop was at the 
fierce little grocery store at 
the bottom of the mountain, fierce 
because in addition to groceries, it 
also sold beer. As Quimby pulled 
to a halt, a little man with a face 
like a wasp was coming out the 
front door. He glared at Quimby 
then got into a car and drove away. 
A sign over the door said: 

GROCERIES, L. Kindell, Prop. 

Inside, on the left Quimby found 
a small, screened section with an- 
other sign which said: 


138 


IF 



U. S Postoffice 
Valley Bottom, Calif. 

To the rear were shelves of can- 
ned goods. To the right was a long 
sit-down bar. Here two Indians were 
drinking beer — and perhaps dream- 
ing in their hearts about the day 
when they would run the last white 
man into the Pacific Ocean. 

Quimby seated himself and a 
monstrous fat man in a dirty apron 
moved ponderously to serve him. 

“Beer,” Quimby said. 

“You from that new observatory 
on top of the mountain? I hear they 
got something they call a radio tele- 
scope up there? What kind of a 
thing would that be?” 

“A device for listening to radio 
noise coming from space,” Quimby 
explained. 

“Noise from space? What the hell 
good would that be even if you 
heard it?” 

“It would help scientists to form 
a slightly more comprehensive pic- 
ture of the universe,” Quimby an- 
swered, evasively. He wanted infor- 
mation, so he intended to be polite, 
but he had no intention of trying to 
explain to this fat man the function 
of the radio telescope. It soon de- 
veloped, however, that the fat man 
was the owner of the store, that he 
cared nothing for radio telescopes — 
or for any other kind — but that he 
was interested in customers from 
the staff of the observatory. “I need 
the business, mister,” the fat man 
explained. “I need it real bad.” 

“I’ll tell our people about you,” 
Quimby said. “I’m sure you will get 
some good customers from them. 


We had a visitor from somewhere 
down here yesterday, a man called 
the hermit. Did you ever hear of 
him?” 

“Huh!” the fat man grunted. 
“Who hasn’t heard of him. What 
was he doing up at your place?” 

“Just curious,” Quimby answered. 

“Just curious! That bare-footed 
corn eater don’t know anything 
about radio. Or does he? Hunh!” 
The fat man was suddenly silent, his 
eyes veiled, thinking. 

“He was certainly an odd bird,” 
Quimby said. “What do you know 
about him?” The tone of his voice 
encouraged conversation. 

“Oh, nothing,” the fat man said, 
shrugging. “Except he came in here 
about six months ago with a water- 
melon as big as a beer keg. He 
tried to trade it to me for gasoline. 
I don’t know where he stole it but it 
was a mighty good melon.” The fat 
man smacked his lips at the me- 
mory of a past sweetness. “He left 
it here and I ate it.” 

“What makes you think he stole 
it?” Quimby asked. 

“How else could he have gotten 
it?” the fat man replied, astonished. 
“You don’t grow watermelons like 
that in this desert. If you coukl 
grow them, you’d be rich as — ” He 
shook his head. “No, he stole it 
somewhere, probably off a truck 
bringing them up from Mexico.” 

Q uimby sipped beer. On the wall, 
the radio mUsic went off the 
air, to be replaced by the voice of 
an announcer. “News flashes. Skin 
diver drowns off Oceanside. Nine 
killed in crash on freeway. Two boy

want, you can always get rock bot- 
tom prices at Rock Bottom Stores, 
where the prices are always at rock 
bottom. In Rock Bottom Stores every 
item is a leader, always.” 

“A funny thing,” the fat man 
said, brooding inside himself. 
“There was another guy in here 
looking for the hermit. You may 
have met him as you came in. Had 
a face that looked like a wasp, he 
did.” 

“Yes, I saw him,” Quimby said, 
suddenly remembering the little man 
who had glowered at him. “What 
about him?” 

“Nothing,” the fat man said, 
evasively. “I never saw him before.” 

Quimby finished his beer, went 
outside, consulted a map, and got 
under way toward the place marked 
as Hermit’s Canyon. He parked his 
car beside the thing that looked 
Hke the foundation of a house, but 
wasn’t. He was studying this strange 
structure when the hermit, attracted 
by the sound of the stopping car, 
came hurrying down the canyon. 

“Edyn! You come see me so 
good!” The hermit’s pale blue eyes 
floated in an ocean of happy grins 
thrown up by the cheeks and the 
mouth. 

“Nice to see you again,” Quimby 
said. He gestured toward the foun- 
dation that was no foundation at all. 
“Tell me — what is this?” 

The ocean of happy grins slipped 
away into shy embarrassment. "Oh, 
that!” The hermit looked at the 
ground. He looked up the canyon, 
where the ground widened and 


where tall pines grew. He looked 
down the canyon, where it narrow- 
ed to rocky walls. He looked toward 
the long flight of stone steps that 
led upward to the plateau above. 
The embarrassment worsened. 

“It is not a this” he said. “It is 
a way to fight the devil — ” 

“Eh?” Quimby said, startled. 

“It is sometimes I have not too 
much to do. For idle hands — what 
is it said?” The bearded, bare-footed 
man groped for words. 

“The devil finds work for idle 
hands to do? Is that what you are 
trying to say?” Quimby asked. 

“Oh, yes,” the hermit said, beam- 
ing. “I also make it — for fun!” 

“Um,” Quimby said. Doubt rose 
in his mind as he looked at one 
stone walk that went nowhere and 
at a second walk that went directly 
to a huge oak tree, ending there as 
if this very spot had been the place 
the builder had intended it to end. 
He looked at the twisting channels 
where no water flowed. At this mo- 
ment, it seemed to him that a pale 
blue light flowed in these channels. 
He blinked his eyes and the light 
was gone. 

“Come, I show you,” the hermit 
said. Again his eyes were floating in 
islands of happy grins thrown up, 
despite the beard, by the cheeks and 
the mouth. 

Q uimby soon realized he was get- 
ting the grand tour. The hermit 
took him up the canyon, where ava- 
cado, orange, apple, apricot, fig, 
and lemon trees were growing — too 
well! There was no irrigation in the 
canyon, neither ditches nor sprinkler

systems were visible. Weeds that had 
sprung up in March under the de- 
lusion that this year this desert land 
would bloom had all died by May. 
No rain had fallen in months, none 
would fall for more months. But the 
hermit’s trees were green and heavy 
with fruit. 

Marvelling at this miracle, Quim- 
by saw that beside each tree, on a 
metal rod thrust into the ground, 
was a helix made of heavy wire, 
with the open end up. Being a 
specialist in antennae systems, Quim- 
by wondered vaguely if these helices 
beside each tree were designed to 
pick up energy flows coming from 
space and to conduct them into the 
ground. While he was pondering this 
question, the hermit took him up the 
steps that led from the bottom of the 
canyon to the plateau above. 

“Did you build these steps?” he 
asked. 

“Yes, Edyn. Keep busy.” The her- 
mit spread his hands in a gesture 
which said he hoped his friend 
would understand. 

At the top of the steps the plateau 
began. Here a dubious path led a 
crooked way through a thin growth 
of wild buckwheat, scrub cedar, 
manzanita, with occasional sugar 
bushes adding a touch of dark green 
to brighten the dark granite boulders 
that were a prominent part of the 
landscape. Quimby took one step 
along the path, saw the rattlesnake 
coiled there in the dust, and hastily 
drew back. 

“Rattler! Look out!” Quimby 
bumped into the hermit as he back- 
ed away, then tried to clutch at the 
ragged overalls, as the hermit, 

THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


laughing, evaded his hands, and step- 
ped on bare feet foward the coiled 
diamond-back. “You idiot! If he 
strikes you — ” He caught and held 
his breath as the hermit bent over 
and grabbed the snake behind its 
head. 

Laughing happily, his cheeks still 
filled with grins, the hermit lifted 
the snake. The five-foot long body 
wrapped itself around his arm. Still 
laughing, the bare-footed man held 
the triangular head toward his vis- 
itor. 

Quimby drew back. 

“This is Archy, Ned!” the hermit 
protested. “Is good friend.” He con- 
centrated his gaze on the beady eyes 
in the triangular head. Quimby 
could have sworn he began to speak 
to the snake. “Is Edyn, Archy. Edyn 
is good friend. It is not supposed to 
rattle tail at friend. Does not bite 
good friend! Never, ever, Archy!” 

Quimby could also have sworn 
that the snake listened to this talk. 
He was so engrossed in what was 
happening that he did not jerk away 
when the hermit suddenly thrust the 
snake toward him. 

“Hold out hand, Edyn. Let Archy 
touch you. Then, when you come 
again, Archy will know you. He 
will not rattle his tail at you, he will 
not bite friend. 

Q uimby thrust out his hand. He 
did not know where he found 
the courage for this action nor where 
he found the courage to let the 
snake rub its head against his fin- 
gers. The snake rubbed against him 
like a cat rubbing against the legs 
of a good friend. Giggling happily. 

Ml 



the hermit set the reptile on the 
ground. It promptly wiggled into 
the scrub brush. Quimby wiped 
sweat from his face and suddenly 
remembered to breathe again. 

The hermit observed these signs 
with anxiety. “Is well, Edyn? Is 
feeling good? Is no need to make 
die worry. Next time Archy will 
not make the rattle at you.*’ 

“How in the devil did you ever 
tame a rattlesnake?” Quimby blurt- 
ed out. 

“Is no hard,” the hermit said, 
shrugging. “Just be friendly to snake, 
he be friendly to you. Is hard life 
to go on belly on ground, to have 
no hands and no feet.” Sympathy 
was in the voice of the bearded 
man. 

“Well, I’m damned!” Quimby 
said. *1 never thought of that!” He 
followed the hermit along a path 
through the scrub growth, then saw 
something in the shade of a sugar 
bush, and stopped suddenly and said 
again, ‘Well, I’m damned!” 

What he was looking at was a 
watermelon as big as a beer keg. 

“The store man said you tried to 
trade him a huge watermelon for 
gasoline but he thought you had stol- 
en it somewhere!” Quimby said. 

“Yes. Did. Not nice, fella in 
store,” the hermit said. “He take 
melon, say he give gasoline, then 
won’t give gasoline. No good.” 

“But how — this place is rocks 
and sand — ” Quimby swept his 
right hand in a motion that included 
the whole arid plateau. “Melons re- 
quire huge quantities of water. How 
can you grow a watermelon like this 
in what is actually a desert?” 


The hermit shrugged. To a man 
who could tame rattlesnakes, no mir- 
acle was really difficult. ‘The spin- 
ner-arounder, it bring juice down 
from sky. Is nothing.” He glanced at 
the sun, now dropping down the 
sky, then looked shyly at his guest. 
‘Would like to eat, Edyn?” 

Without waiting for an answer, 
he took a knife from his pocket, 
opened the blade, bent over, and 
sliced open the watermelon. It was 
dripping with red meat. Finding a 
huge slice thrust into his hands, 
Quimby found it was the most de- 
licious piece of melon he had ever 
eaten. Looking under the sugar bush, 
which was beautifully green, he saw 
another helix with the open end up 
toward the sky. This one was small- 
er than the helices under the big 
trees in the canyon but it apparently 
served the same purpose. 

Q uimby knew that he looked at 
a miracle, and at billions of 
dollars, at deserts blooming with 
new life, and at hope for enough 
food to feed every hungry man, 
woman, and child on Planet Earth. 
All of it apparently done — not by 
mighty atomic power — but by 
something as simple as a coil of 
wire! A miracle achieved by a bare- 
footed man in ragged overalls, by 
a bearded man who made friends 
with rattlesnakes! 

Wonder rose in Ed Quimby, rose 
from springs hidden deep within him 
and he suddenly saw with the eyes 
of wonder that this barren, rocky, 
arid plateau was as rich with promise 
for the future as any fairyland en- 
visioned by the mind of dreaming 


142 


IF 



man! Here, in this place, with a 
little coil of wire with the open end 
pointed at the sky, the human race 
solved its food problems! With the 
jawing belly ache solved, for all 
men, perhaps there might be time 
and energy to solve the other prob- 
lems that followed in the train of 
hunger, war, flood, poverty, and 
crime. 

With wonder still rising in him, 
Quimby saw that just beyond the 
sugar bush that provided shade for 
the watermelon vine, climbing a 
stake thrust into the ground was a 
vine filled with green beans, each 
of which was at least eight inches 
long and as thick as a man’s thumb. 
Seeing Quimby had noticed them, 
the hermit pulled several of the 
beans. Casually, he ate one, handed 
another to his guest. Raw, in its 
own way, it was as sweet and as 
delicious as the watermelon! Quim- 
by now saw that single plants of 
corn were scattered here and there 
on the plateau. Each was heavy 
with ears. And each, he did not 
doubt, had a little helix thrust into 
the sand at its root! And there were 
cucumbers and squash and onions 
and tomatoes, the latter bearing pro- 
duce that was red ripe! Quimby 
knew he had never tasted such ve- 
getables. There were also blackber- 
ries, purpling hands and lips, each 
vine with its own individual helix. 

In this moment, with a green bean 
in one hand and a purple blackberry 
in the other, with strong memories 
of ripe, red watermelon, Ed Quimby 
knew that he stood in the presence 
of bare-footed, ragged, bearded gen- 
ius. 

THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


“How do — How?” Groping for 
words, he stammered a question as 
old as man. “How do you do it? 
How is it done? What makes it 
work?” Then the final question, al- 
ways in the mind of every man. 
“Can I do it too?” 

“Is spinner-around, Edyn. Is wire 
wound in helix. But is not wire! Is 
space filled by wire! But is not 
space, either. Is something that 
makes space — ” 

“What?” Quimby said. “Some- 
thing that makes space — ” 

‘Is form, Edyn. Is shape. Is giv- 
ing form to thing that comes down 
Is juice. Is much juice. Wire is just 
— is just — is just memory of right 
form for juice. Wire is nothing. The 
spinner-arounder would work With- 
out wire if it could remember form 
to take. Form is of importance the 
greatest. One form for green beans, 
another form for watermelons — ” 
“What?” Quimby said, again. “You 
mean you make a helix of a differ- 
ent shape for each plant?” 

T he hermit grinned at him like a 
father whose child has just 
come up with a bright saying. “Is 
different, Edyn. Is all different, Ned. 
Is always everytime everything al- 
ways different, Ed. Has got to be 
this way. Form right for green beans 
is not form right for watermelons, 
Edyn.” 

“But why?” Quimby felt like a 
child who has wandered by mistake 
into a physics laboratory and has 
tried to ask questions as to why 
things are the way they are. Puzzled 
adults, with all the good will in the 
world, were trying to answer the 

143 



child. They weren’t having much 
luck with the answers and the child 
wasn't having much luck in gaining 
understanding. “Why should there 
be a different shape of helix for each 
kind of plant. Why should this be, 
sir?” 

Without noticing what he was 
saying, Quimby had added the “sir” 
of a respectful child speaking to his 
elders! 

The hermit spread his hands in a 
helpless gesture. “Is way worlds are 
made, Edyn. Is way things are made 
different. Is energy different for 
square. Is different for triangle. Is 
different for string bean. Is different 
for watermelon — -” 

“But water is the same for all of 
them,” Quimby protested. “The sun 
is the same. The soil is the same.” 

“Is not giving them water, is giv- 
ing them juice to take place of 
water. See! No Water.” 

Dropping to his knees, the her- 
mit dug with his knife blade around 
the stem of the watermelon vine. 
The ground there was rock hard and 
sandy, with no trace of moisture in 
it. Since this plant used gallons of 
water, Quimby had thought to find 
the soil laden with moisture. But it 
was dust dry. 

“Plant takes sky juice, makes 
water itself from sky juice of right 
shape,” the hermit said. He seemed 
to think he had said something im- 
portant, something true, perhaps 
something basic to the universe. 

Quimby had the feeling the her- 
mit was right. About his words, 
somewhere, was the vague ring of 
truth. But, the correlation between 
specific form and specific energy! 


The idea shook him. He had thought 
of energy as a vague, amorphous 
something. Perhaps it was this, 
somewhere! But when it took on 
shape, it was here, it was different! 
Perhaps energy created shape as a 
device to work through, as a tool! 

44TTow — ” Quimby’s mind was 

O reeling from the effect of 
these ideas. They stretched the mind, 
did these concepts, then, when it 
was stretched as far as it could go, 
they stretched it still farther. The 
over-stretching was felt, vaguely, as 
mental pain. The mind pulled away 
from this pain, seeking refuge in 
practical things that could be under- 
stood. 

“Do — Would those helices cost 
much to manufacture?” Quimby 
asked. 

The hermit shrugged. “A cent, 
maybe. Maybe less. Could make 
forms, then make machines to wind 
wire on forms — ” He shrugged 
again, a careless gesture that said 
this problem would be easy to solve. 

Inside himself, Quimby felt a glow 
coming into existence. He was a 
scientist, and a humanitarian. He 
liked people as individuals and tend- 
ed to glamorize the race. Here was 
a device that would help a great 
many people, that would help the 
race take another step toward some 
dimly understood goal that lay 
somewhere in the region of the sum- 
mer stars. 

As the glow grew stronger, he 
was aware that he had heard a cry 
in the distance. He was aware also 
that the hermit had heard it too. The 
bearded chin was up. The hermit 



was suddenly like a dog sniffing for 
danger in the wind. 

The cry came again. Now it was 
strong enough to be understood. A 
single word. “HelpF 

V 

A t the sound, the hermit went 
into motion. Regardless of the 
effect of sharp rocks on bare feet 
or sharp thorns on already-torn 
overalls, the hermit was making a 
bee-line straight for a pile of huge 
boulders where the sugar bushes 
grew tall and green. Quimby had 
to run to keep up. 

The hermit scrambled to the top 
of a boulder and stood looking 
down. Horror was on his face. Quim- 
by scrambled up the slippery surface 
of the gray granite to stand beside 
him. 

Below was a circular pit perhaps 
twelve feet deep. Like the structure 
down by the road where Quimby 
had parked his car, this pit was 
also made of rough stone, though 
with greater care than the first one. 
The inside of the pit was relatively 
smooth and offered no hold for 
clutching fingers or for feet\ In the 
center of the pit a tall helix-support- 
ing pole rose. Trying now to climb 
the pole was a man with the face 
of a wasp. 

Quimby recognized him instantly 
as the man who had scowled at him 
outside the grocery store in Valley 
Bottom. The wasp had either fallen 
into the pit or had jumped into it 
or had tried to find hand and foot 
hold and had slipped from them to 
the bottom of the pit. 


The wasp man was now trying to 
climb the pole that supported the 
big helix over the pit. 

Quimby looked at the wasp man, 
gasped, and looked again to make 
sure. 

The wasp man looked to be a 
child, he looked to be about three 
feet tall. 

“Oh, the poor little man! Oh, the 
poor man little! Oh, the poor man 
is already little and will get littlier 
. .” the hermit said. 

“What?” Quimby gasped. “He will 
get littlier? What do you mean?” 

“Is in no good place. Is in going 
back place! Is in making smaller 
place — ” the hermit said. 

Aware that others had arrived, the 
little man dropped from the pole 
back to the bottom of the pit. The 
face he turned upward was furiously 
angry. From under his clothes he 
drew what looked like a toy pistol. 

“Get a ladder!” he shouted. “Get 
me out of here!” He emphasized his 
meaning by pointing his pistol at 
the hermit. 

“It is too late, little man!” The 
wail was clearly audible in the her- 
mit’s voice now. “It is too late.” 

“Too late, hell!” Smoke spurted 
from the barrel of the toy pistol, 
flame leaped three inches upward, a 
bullet started upward — and was 
caught by some force. Quimby dis- 
tinctly saw the pea-sized pellet ap- 
pear in the air perhaps two feet be- 
yond the muzzle of the gun, saw it 
hang there motionless for an instant, 
then saw it start to fall backward. 
As it fell, it seemed to grow small®. 
What happened to it, he did not 
know. 


THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


Ml 



(t/^ct me out of here!** The 

VJ voice of the little man was 
now the wail of a lost child crying 
out that the. world was suddenly 
dark and that he was alone in ft. 
While Quimby stared, the little man 
lost inches, became the size of an 
elf, became the size of a doll, be- 
came the size of a man’s thumb, 
became the size of nothing at all. 
The voice calling from the pit was 
silent. 

The only other sound was that of 
the wind going through the sugar 
bushes that grew thick and tall 
around the edge of the pit. The wind 
had a moaning sound in it. 

Quimby slid down the boulder. 
He squatted on the ground under the 
sugar bushes and wiped sweat from 
his face and wondered why his 
stomach was tied into a knot. What 
had happened there in the pit? Un- 
der the pressure of enormous ener- 
gies flowing in from the helix, had 
the atoms of the body of the little 
wasp man shrunk inward into small- 
er and smaller orbits? Quimby did 
not know the answer to this ques- 
tion, or even if such a question 
could be asked. The conventional 
picture of the atom was only a han- 
dy fiction. What if what was called 
matter was actually made up of un- 
counted billions of microscopic he- 
lices existing as forms in some sub- 
space below the levels probed by 
the electron microscope? What if the 
effect of die energy pouring through 
the big helix over the pit was to 
tighten these billions of little helices, 
so that each became like a clock- 
spring wound tight and hence oc- 
cupying less space than when it was 


loosely wound? Would the effect be 
a shrinking in size? 

Quimby did not know the answer 
to these questions. All he knew was 
that it was infernally hot under the 
sugar bushes, that he was sweating, 
and that his stomach had tied itself 
into a knot as tight as the coil of 
a rattlesnake. 

Bare feet rasped on granite as the 
hermit slid down. The shoulders of 
the bearded man drooped. 

“Who was he? I mean the little 
man who looked like a wasp?” 

“I do not know, Edyn. See him 
before, I never did.” 

‘The storekeeper at Valley Bot- 
tom said he had been there look- 
ing for you,” Quimby said. 

“Ah. Yes. Well. Perhaps. So he 
was looking for me, the man said. 
But how did he get past Archy and 
Archy’s brothers?” 

“Eh?” Quimby said. 

“Is here many snakes with rat- 
tling tails. Is not good to come here 
without me, Edyn. How did the little 
man slip past them? This I do not 
understand, Edyn.” 

Q uimby now realized — and ad- 
ditional shock came into him — 
that this plateau was guarded by 
rattlesnakes. The thought chilled 
him . It also tied an additional knot 
in his stomach. 

“Where did he go?” Quimby ask- 
ed. 

“Back,” the hermit said. “To the 
mother. Back.” 

“Back to the mother? What do 
yon mean?” 

“Back to life source. I call it the 
mother,” the hermit said. “AH 


146

things come from her. All things 
go back to her.” 

Quimby found these concepts were 
stretching a mind already stretched 
to the breaking point. His mind, 
acting of its own volition, decided 
that the best solution was to refuse 
to understand the meaning in the 
hermit’s words. 

“Is — isn’t he dead?” 

“Oh, no,” the hermit said. “Has 
just gone into the smallness beyond 
thought. Will come again, some- 
where, sometime . He spread his 
hands in a gesture which said he 
hoped his friend would understand 
that these words had no firm mean- 
ing. 

“I suppose we should report this 
to the sheriff — ” Quimby said, then 
was silent, wondering how such a 
report could get him anything except 


a possible sanity hearing. What 
would Kirk say if he told the ob- 
servatory director what he thought 
he had seen? Quimby shuddered at 
the thought, then wondered how 
many miracles seen by humans are 
hidden away by honest men from 
fear of ridicule. “We’ll decide that 
later,” Quimby said, hastily. 

In the west the sun was dropping 
down toward the top of a far-away 
mountain. The wind coming through 
the sugar bush seemed to have 
grown chilly. 

“Maybe I had better get back to 
my car,” Quimby said. 

“Yes, yes, Edyn,” the hermit said. 
He was sad. 

Quimby rose. He followed the 
hermit toward the stone steps that 
led downward to the bottom of the 
canyon. Suddenly the hermit stop-

ped. Like a bunting dog smelling a 
foreign scent in the wind, the beard- 
ed man seemed to sense the exist- 
ence of something. Then he started 
hunting through the scrub growth. 
Quimby’s stomach tied another knot 
in itself as the object of the search 
came to light 

It was a dead rattlesnake. 

“Was killed, then was hidden,” 
the hermit said, anger in his voice. 

While Quimby watched, he scoop- 
ed a hole in the sandy soil, buried 
the snake there. Quimby had the 
impression that this strange, bare- 
footed, bearded man conducted a 
burial rite of some kind over the 
body of a dead diamondback rattle- 
snake! 

A s they moved away toward the 
stone steps that led downward, 
dusk was slipping silently over the 
plateau. It was that time of the day 
when perspectives shift and com- 
monplace things are suddenly seen 
as very unusual. The sorrowing her- 
mit followed Quimby through the 
scrub growth. 

The two boy scouts were sitting 
on the top step of the stairway that 
led down into the canyon and were 
looking down as if they were expect- 
ing to see someone coming up the 
steps. Their uniforms were torn by 
contact with thorns in the scrub 
brush of the area. Each had his staff 
lying ready to his right hand. 

When they heard footsteps behind 
them, they turned quickly, each 
bringing up his staff as they came 
to their feet. 

“Oh, hello,” Quimby said. His 
mind was too much engrossed by 


the stretching it had recently taken 
for him to give much thought f o 
teenage boy scouts. “Are you the 
lost scouts?” 

They glanced at each other. 

“We’re not lost, sir,” the taller 
said. 

“No? Well, this afternoon the ra- 
dio carried a news flash saying two 
boy scouts were lost in this vicinity 
and were being sought. There’s an 
alert out. Probably helicopters will 
be over the area tomorrow morn- 
tng. 

Involuntarily, they looked at the 
skyr then back to Quimby. 

“But I told you, we’re not lost 
— ” the taller began. 

“All right, all right,” Quimby 
said. “You may not be lost but just 
the same, somebody thinks you 
are.” He turned to speak to the 
hermit. “Do you have a phone? I 
was thinking the boys might use it 
to let their parents know where they 
are. No use—” 

Quimby’s voice went into silence. 
As he was speaking, he had been 
turning. Now he was looking at the 
dim trail through the scrub growth. 

. The trail was empty. 

“Who were you talking to?” the 
voice of the taller boy scout came, 
from behind him. 

“Why, to the man I call the her- 
mit — ” Quimby answered. “He was 
right here behind me — Hermitr 
He lifted his voice in a shout. 

The ground came up and hit him. 
It was just like that. He was not 
aware of anything else striking him, 
it was just that suddenly his knees 
let go and that the ground rushed 
up and hit him in the face.

Q uimby’s first, dazed thought 
when he regained conscious- 
ness was that he was looking at the 
biggest flying saucer ever to pass 
through the skies of Planet Earth. 
His second thought was that he was 
looking at the full mopn just high 
enough to flood the plateau with its 
light. 

He decided — or perhaps he hop- 
ed — the second thought was cor- 
rect. 

He found he was lying on his side 
and as he struggled to get to his 
feet, he discovered that daze was in 
his mind. Something had happened? 
What had it been? He had met two 
lost boy scouts, he had turned to 
speak to the hermit — then he had 
fallen down. 

“That’s the way it was,” he said 
to himself. “That’s the way it hap- 
pened. 

He was lying and he knew it. 
True, things had happened in this 
way, but more had happened than 
just a fall. 

Below, at the bottom of the long 
flight of steps, the canyon was a 
river of darkness that came from no- 
where and went nowhere. At this 
moment, he sensed this darkness 
as an evil thing, then shook his head 
in an effort to clear the emotional 
tone from his mind. A wind moved 
across this haunted plateau where 
watermelons grew as big as beer 
kegs and where a pit existed in 
which a man went backward through 
infinitudes of time, possibly to a 
period when there was no life on 
the planet, with the polar forces at 


the organic level ruling the world. 
Then had come form, then forms, 
each with its own kind of energy. 

Quimby had to shake his head 
again, to clear this thinking out of 
it. A strangeness was in him. Her# 
in this place he had seen a man 
weep over a dead rattlesnake, insist- 
ing the snake had been his friend. 
Quimby suddenly found himself de- 
ciding this was no place for a ration^ 
al man. Being a rational man, ha 
knew he should walk calmly down 
the steps to his car, get in it and 
return to the radio telescope labor- 
atory where dedicated men listened 
for the whisper of footfalls in far- 
away galaxies. 

“Edyn!” The sound was a thin 
wail in a haunted night. “Edyn! 
Help!” 

The cry came from the direction 
of the pit. Quimby ran toward the 
sound. He saw the hermit. The 
bearded man was on top of the rock 
which overlooked the pit. The her- 
mit was not alone. 

The two boy scouts were with 
him. Not only were they with him, 
they were holding him. One on each 
side of the hermit, they were hold- 
ing him by the arms. Then they be- 
gan to swing him as two men may 
swing between them a heavy object 
which they intend to toss to some 
distance. 

T hey threw the hermit. Under the 
rays of the full moon, Quimby 
saw them throw the hermit. Wire 
twanged as his twisting body hit the 
helix over the pit. Then he went 
down. Down! Down! Down into 
something, down into nothing. 


THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT

“Edyn!” he cried out as he fell. 
*Edyn — ” 

His voice grew more and more 
ririll. Quimby had the fantasy that 
die vocal chords which were pro- 
ducing the sound were growing 
smaller and smaller. And smaller 
rill! 

Then the wailing sound went into 
silence and the night was thick with 
haunt and Quimby’s stomach felt 
again like an old, dried dishcloth. 

On top of the rock, the two boy 
scouts executed what seemed to 
Quimby to be a short victory dance. 
He did not doubt that while he was 
unconscious they had hunted down 
the hermit and had dragged him to 
the rock overlooking the pit. He had 
seen them throw him into the hole 
that led to nowhere. Now he was 
watching them execute a victory 
dance, as if they had done some- 
thing very important. The dance fin- 
ished, they slid down from the huge 
rock. Walking, they passed within 
twenty feet of Quimby. He could 
hear their excited voices. They were 
not speaking English. 

Quimby did not know the lan- 
guage they were using. He had never 
heard it spoken before. It seemed 
to him to consist of clacks, gutterals, 
and broken consonants. He watched 
them reach the top of the steps that 
led downward to the canyon, heard 
one cry out in sudden alarm, saw 
another search begin. 

Quimby was a scientist, a research 
man, a trained specialist. His life 
had been spent in electronic labor- 
atories and in lecture halls. With 
this background, it simply did not 
at first occur to him that he was the 


object of this search by two scouts 
on a haunted, moon and wind swept 
plateau where watermelons grew as 
big as beer kegs. Quimby lived in an 
orderly universe. 

“They’re hunting me. r he thought, 
suddenly. 

Nothing in his training had pre- 
pared him for this moment. To him, 
death had always been a far-away, 
remote event, murder had been 
something that happened among 
criminals, and boy scouts had been 
nice kids who helped old ladies 
across busy streets. He did not know 
what to do. 

His legs knew. Run! He listened 
to his legs, and listening, became a 
madman tearing his way through the 
scrub growth. Behind him, he heard 
a shout. He suspected this meant the 
scouts had seen him and were call- 
ing to him to stop. He continued 
running. 

He did not see the taller scout 
lift his staff and point it toward him. 
Nor would he have seen the burst 
of radiation leap from the end of 
the staff and stab him like an arrow 
in the back even if he had been 
looking. The radiation was invisible. 
It did not hurt when it hit. It sim- 
ply produced unconsciousness. 

Quimby regained a flicker of con- 
sciousness as he was swung between 
the two scouts, was swung and 
flung from the top of the rock into 
the pit. This flicker of consciousness 
did not leave him in all that fol- 
lowed. Would to God it had! As he 
fell into the pit, he felt himself be- 
come smaller and smaller — and 
smaller still! Horror boiled through 
him.

I nstead of vanishing, the flicker of 
consciousness that remained to 
him seemed to become more alert, 
more intense, seemed to achieve a 
sharper focus. Because of this he was 
aware of agony. Each cell in his 
body seemed to be collapsing. The 
result was pain of a type Quimby 
had not known existed. 

He did not know how long this 
pain lasted — time seemed to be 
distorted too — but it seemed to him 
that it had already lasted an eternity 
and was due to last forever. Like 
Lucifer falling from heaven — as 
the thought flicked through his 
mind, Quimby wondered if this was 
the way Lucifer had really fallen — 
he fell. And fell. And continued 
falling. 

This was not a distance that could 
be measured in yards, in miles, or 
in light years; it was not a thing of 
the straight line. Indeed, the space 
through which he was falling seem- 
ed to know nothing of straight lines 
but seemed to be involved in curves 
and arcs of circles that were not true 
arcs as men knew them but were 
subtly distorted arcs, subtly twisted 
things, subtly different from the con- 
tinuum that men knew. 

Then the fall slowed and the pain 
receded. It did not vanish, not quite. 
He had the impression that it would 
never vanish entirely, that it would 
go with him as long as his body last- 
ed, as a memory of a horrible dis- 
tortion and as a warning to stay 
away from such distortions in the 
future. As the fall slowed, the energy 
current hit, picked him up like a 


floating chip, and rushed him along 
with it. The sound was like a rush 
of many waters. The feeling that he 
had was that now that his fall had 
stopped, he was caught in a flood 
that moved powerfully and with 
deep purpose toward some strange 
destiny that he did not and could 
never understand. In his mind was 
the thought that a universe that had 
such incredible energies in it was 
mad, then he realized that what was 
new was not necessarily mad. 

The energy flow that was carry- 
ing him suddenly dashed itself 
against an obstruction that was like 
high cliffs on the shores of a forlorn 
sea, dashed itself against the cliffs 
and threw white spray sky-high, then 
turned and ran with silent intensity 
in another direction. 

T his was one tide. There were 
other tides, many other tides, 
that seemed to pass without inter- 
ference through each other, other 
tides that carried other chips such 
as Quimby. Moving in such a tide, 
in obvious utter terror, he caught a 
glimpse of a little man who looked 
like a wasp. At this moment, Quim- 
by would have welcomed the pres- 
ence of a rattlesnake. He tried to 
shout at the little man — if a shout 
could have been uttered or heard 
here — but before he could catch 
the attention of the wasp man, the 
flowing energy had changed direc- 
tion. Quimby found himself moving 
off at super speed in a direction he 
could not comprehend. Looking for- 
ward, he saw more high cliffs. And 
he recognized them! And he knew 
where he was! 


THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


IS1 



He was in the mad structure the 
hermit had built at the bottom of 
the canyon. The bearded man had 
not told the truth — or not all of 
it — when he had said he had built 
this place for fun. No! The crooked 
walls, the paths that went nowhere, 
the fireplace where no fire had ever 
burned or ever would burn, all of 
these served to direct these energy 
flows, to turn the energy from one 
path to another, to twist it, to re- 
duce the size of the flow and hence 
to increase its intensity, to change 
its frequency, to shift it upward to 
other kinds of energy, to lower the 
frequency so that now it pounded as 
a heavy surf upon a sullen, rocky 
shore, now it let spread itself out as 
waves spread themselves on the 
sandy beaches of south Pacific is- 
lands. So much would the mother 
energy do, if ordered! So much and 
much, much more! 

Suddenly Quimby found himself 
wondering how the inside of a radio 
receiver would look if seen from the 
viewpoint of the energy flowing 
there! What would a transistor look 
like to the micro-waves flowing 
through it? How would the radia- 
tions see a capacitor? What would 
a transmitter look like to the hurry- 
ing energies jumping through it? 
And the program carried by the 
transmitter — whether TV or radio 
— How would a singer be seen from 
the viewpoint of the carrier wave? 
Suppose a human was reduced to 
the size of an ion. How would he 
see energy? Would he experience it 
as a flow of many waters? Would 
energy make a sound that resem- 
bled a waterfall? 


“This is fantasy!” Quimby 
thought. Whatever it was, it was 
happening. He remembered now, 
how the hermit had been able to 
detect the flow of radio waves 
through a wire. Or through space. 
Had this strange ability enabled him 
to construct not only the crazy foun- 
dation for a building in the canyon 
but also the pit up above, plus the 
little helices that fed energy to the 
trees in the canyon and to the vege- 
tables growing on the plateau? Oth- 
er questions passed through Quim- 
by’s mind. 

The flow was changing directions 
again. Was a resistor ahead? A cap- 
acitor? A transformer? All he could 
discern was that the current flow 
was changing direction and was now 
creating a whirlpool, an eddy that 
circled and circled and circled, now 
spinning upward as if it was caught 
in a helix similar to those on the 
plateau where watermelons grew at 
big as beer kegs and as sweet as 
honey. Now it was spinning down. 
Down and up. Up and down! Larg- 
er, smaller. Smaller, larger! Rhy- 
thms endlessly repeated. Rhythms 
that Quimby suddenly realized were 
a part of all life and of all living. 

“Edyn!” a voice called. 

T urning, Quimby saw the hermit. 

The bearded man was making 
swimming motions and was pointing 
that a stream of energy that spew- 
ed out of the eddy and took another 
direction, moving toward vaguely 
pink walls in the distance. 

“That way, Edyn! That way out!” 
The hermit’s thoughts came into his 
mind. 



"What. about you?** Quimby call- 
ed back. 

“Not now, ,Edyn. Maybe later, 
maybe not. Go, Edyn. Quickly go 
now. Time is!” 

It did not seem strange to Quimby 
that he should be picking up direct- 
ly the meaning in the mind of the 
bearded man. He also picked up the 
sense of enormous urgency. His 
mind translated this feeling of ur- 
gency into birth symbols. Kicking 
like a frog with both legs, he mov- 
ed toward the stream of energy that 
diverged from the eddy and was 
caught by it. 

“Go, Edyn, go!” the hermit’s 
thinking came to him as from a 
great distance. “Go! Go! Go! Time 
is!” 

Quimby went. Ahead of him, as 
though recognizing the meaning of 
die hermit’s words, pink walls grew 
suddenly large, astonishingly pink, 
then opened. He went through this 
opening and into a tube that he 
eould not describe. His dazed im- 
pression was that the walls of this 
tube were converging on him and 
were squeezing him, then he realiz- 
ed that as he had shrunk in size 
after being thrown into the pit on 
the plateau, so now he was increas- 
ing in size, and that the walls 
seemed to be converging because he 
was growing larger. Another pink 
wall appeared ahead of him. He was 
thrown head-first against it. Sud- 
denly the wall let go, his mind and 
his whole body was wrenched and 
stretched in incredible pain, and he 
was hurled outward, head-first, to 
land in darkness. 

At this moment, when conscious- 

THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


ness was really extinguished, Quim- 
by blessed the darkness. It was so 
good not to know, so good not to 
feel the enormous mind-stretching 
that came from knowing! 

W hen consciousness came back 
to him, the first sound he 
heard was the beat of motors in the 
sky. Slowly, he awakened, to find 
himself lying in a thick of pine 
needles under one of the big trees 
in the bottom of the canyon. He had 
vague memories of having been 
hurled through the air and of hav- 
ing landed here, this happening in 
some remote past. Sitting up, he 
discovered his clothing was badly 
torn, this coming from his mad 
flight through the scrub growth on 
top of the plateau, he told himself. 
His clothing was also covered with 
a kind of slippery secretion which 
he thought was dew, as were his 
hands and his face. Trying to wipe 
this stuff away, he got to his feet. 
There, before his eyes, was the crazy 
structure the hermit had built. In 
the light of a mid-morning sun, it 
looked to be just what the hermit 
had said it was, the work of idle 
hands trying to find something to 
do to keep the devil away. In this 
light, it also looked crazy. Had he 
actually been reduced to microscop- 
ic size and had he flowed with en- 
ergy currents between these strange 
wails? 

“Nonsense!” Quimby thought, 
without any real sureness. 

He saw his car, parked where he 
had left it the day before. Beyond 
the car, he caught a glimpse of the 
steps rising up to the plateau above 

153 



the canyon. Up there he again 
heard the sound of motors. Now he 
saw the helicopter dropping slowly 
toward a landing on the plateau. He 
went across the canyon and up the 
steps as fast as his legs and his wind 
would carry him. 

Later, he would wonder about his 
motives for this action. He knew 
that two deadly boy scouts were — 
or had been — on that plateau. He 
knew they had flung him into an 
incredible pit. Why should he go 
into an area where such obvious 
danger lurked? Later, he would de- 
cide that his hunger for human 
companionship, as represented by 
the pilot of the helicopter, was so 
great that it overwhelmed all other 
emotions, all other thoughts. He 
wanted to be with somebody hu- 
man! Nothing else mattered at this 
moment. 

As Quimby, panting hard for 
wind, reached the top step, he saw 
that the ship was already down, that 
the pilot was out of it, and was 
staring at something on the ground. 
As Quimby approached, the pilot 
looked up at him. The expression 
on the pilot’s face said that he, too, 
was glad to see another human at 
this moment. Very glad indeed. He 
pointed down. 

VIII 

I n an open space where the brush 
was thin, the two boy scouts lay. 
Their bodies were so grotesquely 
swollen that Quimby needed only a 
glance to know that they were dead, 
also the cause of death. Beside them, 
gathered into a pile, were dozens of 


tiny helices. Like weapons that had 
fallen from fingers that no longer 
had the strength to hold them, the 
staff of each scout lay at the end of 
the outstretched hands. 

The pilot’s face was a mixture of 
horror and confusion. The horror 
came from the sight of the two 
bodies on the ground, the confusion 
came from another source. 

“There must be a mistake some- 
where,” the pilot said. 

“Where?” Quimby asked. 

“Well, I came up here, as a vol- 
unteer, to help find the two missing 
scouts.” 

.“So you’ve found them.” 

“But just as I spotted these two 
bodies, a report came over the radio 
saying that another search party had 
found them, in a cave at the lower 
end of Hermit’s Canyon, dead — 
apparently murdered — their uni- 
forms and their equipment gone.” 
The pilot shook his head. “So that 
report must have been a mistake. 
Here they are. Right here.” Shaking 
his head, he pointed toward the two 
bodies on the ground. 

“Let’s hope it wasn’t a mistake,” 
Quimby said. 

“Huh? What—” 

“It’s just that the world is so 
much easier to understand if the 
report you heard is true, if there 
are four dead scouts — ” Quimby 
stopped as he saw the horror mount 
on the face of the pilot. He shook 
his head and wiped sweat from his 
face. “Don’t pay any attention to 
me,” he continued. “The heat’s got 

j) 

me. 

“The heat? Yes, the heat,” the 
pilot said. “It is hot up here.” Hie

face lightened. Perhaps he wasn t 
dealing with a crazy man after all! 

“Why don’t you get on the radio 
in your ship and check out that re- ; 
port?” Quimby said. ] 

‘•‘Sure. Sure. I’ll do that.” 

As the pilot returned to his heli- 
copter. Quimby dropped to one knee 
beside the pile of helices. The two 
— creatures, he now decided to call 
them — must have worked most of 
the night finding each little helix 
here on this arid plateau. He had $ 
no idea what they were going to do 
with them. Perhaps take them to 
some other country, perhaps even 
destroy them. More than he had 
ever wanted anything in his life, Ed 
Quimby wanted these little helices, 
wanted all of them. In them, hidden 
away in the shape of the twisted 
wires, perhaps in the metal itself. ’ 
was a sure cure for famine on Plan- , 
et Earth far into the future. Per- 
haps they held other secrets too. He 
had had no time to think about pos- 
sible other secrets, the cure for fa- 
mine had been and still was enough 
to engage all of his attention. 

P erhaps it had also engaged the 
full attention of the creatures 
on the ground. In an event, they had 
been willing to murder to get it. :i. 

Carefully, Quimby picked up a 
helix. 

In his mind again was the dream jj 
of the desert blooming with rich I 
vegetation, with vegetables, melons, 
and berries, perhaps green with 
broad acres of wheat in the spring, 
brown with the wheat harvest in 
June and July. 

In his fingers, the little helix 



THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 




crumbled to dust, then to something 
less than dust. It fell away into noth- 
ing and became something less than 
nothing, into particles so tiny the 
eye could not detect them as they 
fell to the ground — if they fell! 
Perhaps they did not fall, perhaps 
they became motes flowing in the 
sunbeams. 

As the little helix crumbled, some- 
thing in Edward Quimby died. It 
was a dream of a world a little 
better than die world he knew, a 
world in which no man, no woman, 
and no child was every hungry. As 
the dream faded and fell away into 
particles the size of nothing at all, 
pain came into Quimby’s mind, a 
spate of it, that he knew would never 
wholly leave him until in some time 
and in some {dace he saw with his 
own eyes the desert green with rich 
vegetation. 

But perhaps the dream was still 
possible! He reached hastily for a 
second helix. 

It too melted into nothing at the 
touch of his fingers. 

Now he saw that all of the little 
helices were fading away, were fall- 
ing off into nothing. This was hap- 
pening as the sun rose higher and 
higher. He watched the sun of earth 
erode them away. 

He felt as if his heart was eroding 
away with diem. 

He reached now for the nearest 
staff. 

It, too, was crumbling. Somehow 
he was glad that this was happening, 
somehow the sight of the crumbling 
staff eased a little the pain that was 
in his heart. He saw, now, that the 
second staff was also eroding away. 


Hoping that the two bodies would 
go the same way, he looked at them. 

The bodies remained what they 
were, bodies, swollen and grotesque. 

Footsteps told him the helicopter 
pilot was returning. 

“The report was right,” the pilot 
said. His manner was that of a man 
determined to report the truth no 
matter how much he wished the 
truth was something else. 

“They found two bodies in this 
cave last night. Early this morning, 
they flew the fathers of the boys in 
here. The fathers identified their 
sons. But nobody knows anything 
about these two scouts!” 

Wiping sweat from his face, he 
glared at the bodies on the ground. 

‘Tut in another call and get the 
state troopers up here,” Quimby 
said. “Let them solve the problem 
of the identity of these two bodies. 
Also let them find out if the uni- 
forms these two are wearing came 
from the two scouts found dead in 
the cave.” As he spoke, Quimby rose 
to his feet. 

“I already called the troopers,” 
the pilot said. “But what — Hey l 
There at the edge of that bush! Hey! 
Look outr 

tiT’ve already seen him,” Quimby 

X said. 

“But it’s a rattlesnake!” the pilot 
shouted. 

“I know,” Quimby said. 

“But, man — ” 

“Are they dangerous?” Quimby 
said. 

“Dangerous?” 

“When you have watched die the 
dream I have just watched die, it’s 


156 


IF 



hard to get upset about a little thing 
like a rattler,” Quimby said. 

“But it’s moving toward you!” 

“I know,” Quimby said. 

As if its, body was following an 
invisible helix that lay along the 
ground, the snake came out from 
under the bush. Quimby did not 
move. It stopped at his feet. In the 
manner of a cat meeting an old 
friend, it rubbed the right side of 
his right foot with its thick, trian- 
gular head, then followed its invis- 
ible helix into the bushes. 

“God Almighty!” the pilot whis- 
pered. 

“He said Archy would know me 
as a friend when we mel again,” 
Quimby said. “Perhaps — perhaps 
— perhaps — ” He felt the pressures 
back of his eyes “Perhaps some- 
where, sometime, I may meet him 
again — perhaps the dream may live 
again — ” 

The pressures back of his eyes 
came outward in the form of tears. 
To Quimby, this did not matter. In 
his mind the dream was stirring and 
coming to life. 

“ Meet him again? Who are you 
talking about?” the dazed pilot ask- 
ed. 

“About the hermit, about the man 
who lived here. Perhaps we shall 
meet again. Perhaps, then, the little 
helices will no longer crumble into 
dust,” Quimby said. He wiped the 
tears away from his eyes, moved 
through the brush. 

“Where are you going?” the pilot 
asked. 

“There is an old pit, perhaps an 
old reservoir for storing water, over 
in this direction,” Quimby said. 


Perhaps he hoped he would find 
the hermit sitting on the edge erf 
this pit! 

Going through the brush, with the 
pilot following, he saw another 
watermelon that was as big as a 
beer keg. He saw at a glance that 
the helix was gone from the serf! 
where the vine rooted. The vine had 
already begun to wilt. 

“Look at that watermelon!” the 
pilot shouted. “How could it have 
grown here? There must be water 
here, possibly springs — ” 

“Possibly,” Quimby said. 

He reached the big boulders be- 
side the pit. The hermit was not sit- 
ting on the rim of the pit. There was 
no rim. There was no pit. 

“Must have been a fife here,” 
the pilot said. 

T he sugar bushes were burned 
and gone, the big boulders were 
blackened as from intense heat. The 
walls of the pit were gone, the pole 
that had supported the big helix 
was gone. The soil around the pit 
had been converted by something 
similar to intense heat into a dry 
mulch which puffed up under their 
feet as they walked on it. 

Circling the spot where the pit 
had been, Quimby found three v*s 
made of segments of broken quartz 
such as could be found in many 
intruding veins in this region. Like 
arrow heads, the tips of the v*« 
pointed toward the pit. If Quimby 
made anything of these, he kept his 
ideas to himself. 

As they returned to the clearing 
where the two bodies lay, they saw 
another rattlesnake, then another. 


THE SMALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


157 



and another, and another. The pilot 
was badly shaken, wanting to know 
how any human could have lived in 
a place so infested with reptiles 
Quimby had no answer to this ques- 
tion. He did not mention that he 
had seen at least ten more snakes 
than the pilot had glimpsed, all mov- 
ing toward the rim of the plateau 
as if they were quitting the plateau, 
perhaps forever. 

“Do you suppose those snakes 
killed those scouts?” the pilot asked. 

“What else?” Quimby asked. 

“But their bodies are so swol- 
len — ” 

“If a dozen of the fat fellows who 
Kve up here struck you, your body 
would swell too, as you died,” 
Quimby said. 

“Don’t talk like that!” the pilot 
said. “Where are you going now?” 

“Down to the bottom of the 
canyon.” 

“I’ll go with you!” the pilot has- 
tily volunteered. 

“You had better stay here, with 
your helicopter,” Quimby said. “I’ll 
wait down below and when the 
troopers arrive, I’ll send them up to 
you.” 

As he reached the bottom of the 
steps, Quimby saw a car was pulling 
to a stop beside his automobile. He 
moved toward it — and recognized 
the driver as the owner of the 
combination grocery store and beer 
joint at Valley Bottom, L. Kindell. 

“On the radio there’s talk about 
some missing boy scouts — ” Kin- 
dell began. 

“Yesterday, when 1 stopped at 
your place, I saw a small man who 
looked like a wasp,” Quimby said. 


The grocer stared at him in non- 
recognition. “I don’t believe I re- 
member you,” he said. 

“That isn’t important,” Quimby 
said. “The little man with a face 
that looked like a wasp, he’s impor- 
tant. You said he had stopped at 
your store and had asked about the 
hermit who lives here — ” 

“Me? I said that? Mister, what 
are you talking about? I came out 
here as a public-spirited citizen.” 

44Hphe little man with a face like 
a wasp,” Quimby repeated. 
“Did somebody hire him to come 
here and find out how the hermit 
could grow such big watermelons on 
top of a waterless plateau.” 

“Mister — ” the grocer repeated. 

“The secret of growing watermel- 
ons like the one you said the hermit 
tried to trade you for gasoline would 
be worth billions of dollars,” Quim- 
by continued. He watched Kindell’s 
face. There were puffy pouches un- 
der the man’s eyes. The skin was 
turning gray. 

“You mean you — Mister, are 
you accusing me — ” The man’s 
cheeks puffed out from the words 
he wanted to use. 

“Accusing you hadn’t occurred to 
me — until now,” Quimby said. 

“Mister!” 

‘The little man with a face like 
a wasp probably won’t be back,” 
Quimby said. 

“Won’t be back? Eh? What hap- 
pened to him — I mean — ” The 
grocer’s face went from gray to 
white and the pouches under his 
eyes seemed to enlarge. “Mister, I 
heard on the radio about two miss-

IF 



mg boy scouts. I came out here to 
do my duty as a good citizen to 
volunteer to help find them.” 

“Somewhere down the canyon are 
two dead scouts,” Quimby said. He 
jerked his thumb toward the narrow 
treacherous road that led downward. 
“There are two more on top of the 
plateau.” 

“But that makes four. The radio 
said two — ” 

“They have increased in numbers 
since that report.” 

' “Mister—” 

“Take your pick of the boy 
scouts,” Quimby said. “But I doubt 
if you will ever find the little man 
who looked like a wasp. I don’t 
think anybody will ever be able to 
find him.” 

The grocer jabbed at the throttle 
of his car. The rear wheels kicked 
dirt and gravel into the air. The 
car disappeared among the pine 
trees, gaining speed, going down 
the canyon. 

Dimly, Quimby heard the ripping 
sound of the crash. He knew what 
had happened. The car had gone out 
of control and had plunged off the 
narrow trail and into the canyon. He 
didn’t bother to go look at the acci- 
dent. 

It was too far away, he was 
too tired, the state troopers would 
look into it when they arrived. And 
anyhow, he felt that whatever had 
happened to the grocer, the fellow 
had richly deserved it. 

Quimby sat down on the stone 
bench beside the structure that the 
hermit had built, “just for fun”. 
Now he saw something that he had 
not noticed before. 

THE SHALLNESS BEYOND THOUGHT 


W orked into the stone work were 
many fragments of quartz. 
Moving closer, he studied these cry- 
stals with care. They were identical 
with the quartz fragments that had 
been used to build v’s around the 
pit up above, v arrows that had 
pointed at the pit which was no 
longer a pit, which, was no longer 
anything at all except ashes. 

Quimby knew then that in some 
way that he did not understand at 
all these quartz crystals controlled 
the flow and the focus of some un- 
known form of energy. 

On the plateau, the energy had 
destroyed a stone pit. Down here in 
this structure, it — Quimby sighed. 
He did not know what the energy 
did down here and he was afraid to 
try to remember what he had ex- 
perienced. Rising to his feet, he 
studied the channels that formed the 
inside of the incredible foundation 
the hermit had built. There was a 
vague familiarity about it some- 
where but he could not put his fin- 
ger on the familiarity. He saw, how- 
ever, that additional quarts crystals 
lined the insides of the “founda- 
tion.” If electromagnetic energies 
flowed through these channels, his 
fingers were not sensitive enough to 
detect them. If a sub-microscopi« 
being that he had once called “H«p» 
mit” moved there, his eyes were not 
sensitive enough to discern it. Nof 
could he see anywhere a little mail 
with a face like a wasp. 

The fact that he could see neither 
proved nothing except the limitations 
of his vision. 

A siren wailed in the upper 
reaches of Hermit’s Canyon. Quim-

by sighed. When the car pulled up, 
he went to meet the two state troop- 
ers and to explain his presence here. 

“I came to help look for two 
missing boy scouts,” he said. “A hel- 
icopter pilot on top of the plateau 
has found something.” 

He watched the two officers climb 
the steps that led to the top of the 
plateau. 

44/^oddamn it, Ed,” Kirk said. 

vJ “Goddamn it!” Kirk’s voice 
was weak. “Who was the hermit? 
Where did those two extra boy 
scouts come from? Why did they 
destroy that pit? Why did they gath- 
er all of those helices in one place? 
Why did the helices turn to powder? 
How did the helices work? What 
happened to the hermit? Goddamn 
it, I saw him detect radio waves 
with his fingers! Goddamn it, Ed — ” 
Quimby did not attempt to an- 
swer. He moved to the window of 
the director’s office, stood looking 
out at the radio telescope, stood 
looking down at the tangle of can- 
yons and plateaus so far below. He 
knew the radio telescope was func- 
tioning again. 

“We’ve got the scope pointed in 
the wrong direction,” he said. 

“Eh?” the director asked. 

“We’ve got it pointed out, to lis- 
ten for footfalls out yonder where 
the galaxies are,” Quimby continued. 
“We should turn it around and point 
it down there below us . .” 

As his voice slipped into uneasy 
silence, cold chills went up his spine. 

“Down there — ” He pointed. 
“Down there is where they’re walk- 
ing.” END

HUE 

AND 

CRY 


Dear Editor: 

I enjoyed the story Origin of 
Species in the October issue of If, 
but I must say that Mr. Robert F. 
Young committed a howling blun- 
der. On page 68 he very carefully 
specifies the south central plateau 
of France as the place of action. 
But then the hero wonders about 
Canis dims , the dire wolf, about 
Mylodon and Megatherium, all of 
which lived 50,000 years later in 
California and did not, at any time, 
live in Europe. He continues the 
mixup by seeing a condor flying 
around. Like the sloths, the condor 
is most typically an American bird. 
The proper bird for that land- 
scape would have been an Alpine 
stone eagle. 

In conclusion, let me join in 
Sprague de Camp’s plea : since 

“Cro-Magnon” is a place name, 
the people should be called the Cro 
Magnards. — Willy Ley. 

0 All right, but what kind of bird 

Is the sloth? — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I’ve just finished Skylark Du- 
Quesne and it’s the best serial I've 
read since Way Station, also known 
as Here Gather the Stars. 

But that is not the reason I have 
written this letter. Ordinarily I 


don’t care about covers as long as 
the stories are good, but lately I've 
noticed that If 9 covers ■ have been 
poor if not downright nauseating. 
Pederson and McKenna are a pair 
of the worst artists I have ever 
seen. The June and July covers 
attest to this, although I think Mc- 
Kenna is improving and Gaughan’s 
illustrations brighten up the scene 
somewhat. 

Another complaint I have is about 
your bindings ( Galaxy and Worlds 
of Tomorrow included). Why do you 
have to spatter them with all the 
colors of the rainbow? You also do 
not have to list the authors’ names 
there; the contents page does that 
job nicely. How about having bind- 
ers to cover up the whole mess? 

If has come a long way since 
you first took over in 1961, and it's 
just copped my vote for a Hugo! —

Sir, it will be of great assistance 
to us, the members of the Rocketry

from which we could have first- 
hand information about what is 
going on in U.S. regarding space.

Dear Editor: 

Information please! What is the 
title and author of the story 
described below? 

A man ki taken from his space- 
craft to fight a creature, described 
as a "Red Roller,” with which 
Earth is at war. An invisible wall 
separated them which only uncon- 
scious or dead things can pass. The 
loser’s race is to be destroyed; 
and the Red Roller m killed. 

I would also like to know of any 
sf clubs I can join. — Linda Leach,

Dear Editor: 

I haven’t read a single story in 
the October ’66 ish of If, just the 
editorial page and the readers’ 
column. Already I am convinced 
by one of the letters that you 
printed. 

It usually takes me a few days 
to become incensed at a letter or 
story, or comment that you or 
somebody else makes on the readers’ 
page. However, this issue was dif- 
ferent. 

Bruce Berry’s letter had me 
enraged from the first paragraph. 
That any sane sf fan who 
has read over one Issue of If and 
can still make a comment like, "So 
far as I have been able to find out, 
their opinions of W.O.T. & If are 
quite low.” is beyond MY imagin- 
ation ! I have made no six-year 
study of reader reactions to edi- 

142 


torial policies nor have I been 
reading sf for thirty-odd years. 
I’m just a teenager with a wild 
imagination that caters to, and 
desires sf. I’ve been reading sf for 
almost three years now and I have 
not been able to find magazines 
anywhere, anytime that contains 
stories such as yours that chal- 
lenge my imagination and intelli- 
gence as much as the stories in 
Galaxy, W.O.T., and If. All my 
friends that read sf agree with me 
that your magazines are tops. 

These are just my first im- 
pressions that I got from reading 
Mr. Berry’s letter. After I finished 
reading it once I went back and 
read it again. This time I noticed 
all the good and valid points that 
he made in his letter. I read it 
one more time to make sure I un- 
derstood everything that he said 
before I wrote. 

Count me a staunch supporter 
of Mr. Bruce Berry. 

I almost forgot. Mr. Pohl, you’re 
a great writer but please don’t 
waste your time on lousy stories 
like Under Two Moons. It was 
pathetique ! It was too tongue-in- 
cheek to be palatable; in fact, it 
was almost like one of the worse 
MAN PROM U.N.C.L.E. shows.—

Lane, Burlington, North Carolina
