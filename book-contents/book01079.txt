The ROSICRUCIANS (amorc) 

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA 
(NOT a religious organization) 




WHAT ARE ALIENS MADE OF? 



/"kNE of the most resourceful 
men on this planet is Lester 
Green of Prospect, Conn. Word 
for word, here are some of his 
truly incredible achievements that 
literally made news: 

One fall Lester flooded a 
meadow to insure a good ice crop 
for the summer. While cutting ice 
during February he found a setting 
of hen’s eggs in a block of ice. 
These he placed in a pan on top 
of his furnace to thaw out. A few 
days later he found eight Leghorn 
chicks in the pan, each covered 
with what resembled fur instead 
of feathers. 

When Lester’s chimney caught 
fire he went to the roof and threw 
sand down it. His wife, excited, 
mistook washing soda for salt and 
filled the stove with it. The fire 
fused the two materials and filled 
the stovepipe and chimney solidly 
with glass. 

Hearing of Thomas A. Edison’s 
experiment to extract rubber from 
goldenrod, Lester invented a sys- 
tem for producing dairy products 
from milkweed. He attached Mrs. 
Green’s vibrating machine and 
churned the juice of the plants so 
that the leaves exuded butter. 

Finding a snapping turtle that 



had been scared out of its shell, 
Lester made another for it out of 
concrete into which the turtle 
crawled and rewarded its benefac- 
tor by keeping his feed house free 
of rats and mice. 

To assure a winter crop of fresh 
apples Lester sprayed his trees 
with glue which prevented the 
fruit’s dropping off in the fall. Dur- 
ing the winter a fresh apple al- 
ways was available merely by 
washing off the glue. 

While butchering a hog Lester 
discovered the fluid responsible 
for the curl in a pig’s tail. By rub- 
bing it on their hair Mrs. Green 
and her daughter produced beau- 
tiful permanent waves. 

Great as Lester Green is, C. 
Louis Mortison of the Waterbury 
Republican and American is great- 
er, for Green is Mortison’s inven- 
tion, and the exploits quoted are 
among the many in Hoaxes by 
Curtis D. MacDougall, published 
by Dover Publications, 920 Bway., 
N.Y. 10, @ $1.75. (Address and 
price are given to duck mail.) 

“Ridiculous as some of these 
stories may appear,” MacDougall 
continues, “the following results 
are on record: 

“A Canadian farmer tried to 

5 




buy a pair of the fur-coated 
chickens. Mortison answered that 
they had sweltered to death in the 
warm weather. 

“Two prominent chemical engi- 
neers tried to find the Green home 
to investigate the chimney filled 
with glass. 

“American and Canadian glue 
manufacturing concerns sent let- 
ters addressed to Lester Green 
asking what kind of glue he used 
for his apples, and a representa- 
tive of a Boston concern came to 
Prospect to investigate. 

“Mrs. Green was inundated with 
requests for the exact method of 
extracting the pigtail fluid.” 

MacDougall’s worthy purpose 
is to expose hoaxes — and hoaxes 
should indeed be exposed, espe- 
cially vicious ones. 

But it is no disrespect to his 
purpose to say that the charm of 
Hoaxes is the array of engaging 
whoppers constructed for the sheer 
love of invention, not only meant 
to hurt nobody but to enrich their 
lives, as indeed they do. 

For MacDougall, in attributing 
the success of hoaxes to every- 
thing from indifference to preju- 
dice and ignorance, does not at- 
tribute enough to their inventors’ 
ability to sweat illogic into the 
shape — ■ if not the substance — of 
logic. 

This is deadly, of course, in evil 
causes. For instance, the Nazi 
claim that Jews have a far higher 



incidence of insanity than any 
other religious group is true. But 
it happens to coincide with the ur- 
ban rate, which is the only one 
that should be applied. Ukases for- 
bidding Jews to own land forced 
them into the cities, making them 
an urban people — and therefore 
subject to the same stresses as all 
other city folk. As to the oft-made 
charge that they prefer city life, 
the Bible says otherwise, and the 
phenomenal modern agricultural 
production of Israel confirms the 
Bible’s testimony. 

Very far from evil in such in- 
tent or effect are Mortison’s 
hoaxes. And that a faker can be a 
hero, commemorated as one, you 
can see for yourself outside Win- 
sted, Conn., where the welcoming 
signs read: 

Winsted, founded in 1799, has 
been put on the map by the ingen- 
ious and queer stories that em- 
anate from this town and which 
are printed all over the country, 
thanks to L. T. Stone. 

Unfortunately, Louis T. Stone, 
the “Winsted Liar,” is not living 
proof. He died in 1933, managing 
editor of the Evening Citizen, 
whose building also marks his mem- 
ory with a plaque, and a bridge 
named after him has been built 
over — what else? — Sucker Brook. 

Beginning his journalistic tail- 
tale career in 1895, Stone brilliant- 



6 



GALAXY 




ly manufactured circumstances that 
made the following dazzlers seem 
entirely reasonable: 

A tree on which baked apples 
grew. 

A farmer who plucked his chick- 
ens for market with a vacuum 
cleaner. 

A rooster that stopped a train. 
(MacDougall doesn’t say, but my 
recollection of latter-day versions 
— hoaxes neither die nor fade 
away— was that the rooster stopped 
the train to save a life.) 

A deaf and dumb pig. 

A three-legged bullfrog. 

A hen that laid a red-white-and- 
blue egg on the Fourth of July. 

A Plymouth hen that hopped off 
a railroad engine's cowcatcher when 
“Plymouth” was called, and left an 
egg “to pay for her ride.” 

A cat with a harelip that whistled 
“Yankee Doodle.” 

A modest cow owned by two old 
maids that refused to -let any man 
milk her. 

Three tunneling trout that bur- 
rowed their way underground from 
Highland Lake to Mr. Stone’s 
brook and received their New 
Year’s Day meal annually from 
Mr. Stone’s hand. 

A man who painted a spider on 
his bald head to keep the flies away. 

A watch in the stomach of a cow 
that lost only two hours over a 
period of years because the breath 
of the animal acted as an automatic 
winder. 



Hoaxes deserves to be read for 
its relentless tracking down of 
frauds in art, history, literature, 
science, politics and journalism. 

But there is a wonderfulness in 
the harmless exuberant imagina- 
tions — the purely entertaining 
variety — that science fiction could 
use more of, not just now but at 
any time in the past or future. This, 
in other words, is one thing there 
can’t be too much of. 

Writers willing to settle for ten- 
tacled aliens might instead be in- 
spired by the whirling whimpus, 
which spins so fast that nobody 
knows what one looks like; the 
rubberado, which bounces when 
shot, and anyone who eats it 
bounces, too; the tripodero, which 
has extensible legs and stuns its 
enemies with clay pellets shot from 
its blowgun proboscis; the racka- 
bore — adapted to living on hills, it 
has two legs, either left or right, 
shorter than the other two — but 
may be overspecialized because 
neither the left- nor right-legged 
type can turn in the opposite direc- 
tion. 

These and the wonders of the an- 
cients were invented with such 
minuteness of detail to amaze the 
folks back home. Until the stars are 
explored, we all are the folks back 
home, and we love being amazed 
by cleverly fashioned aliens. Ten- 
tacles? 

Bah, humbug!

DRUNKARD'S 



A taut, brilliant new novel by the author of Gravy 



Planet, Slave Ship anti other great Galaxy serialsl 



T HIS man’s name is Cornut, 
born in the year 2166 and 
now thirty. He is a teacher. 
Mathematics is his discipline. 
Number theory is his specialty. 
What he instructs is the mnemonics 
of number, a study which absorbs 
all his creative thought. But he also 
thinks about girls a lot. 

He is unmarried. He sleeps alone 
and that is not so good. 

If you wander around his small 
bedroom (it has lilac walls and a 
cream ceiling; those are the Math 
Tower colors), you will hear a 
whispering and a faint whirring 
sound. These are not the sounds of 
Cornut’s breath, although he is 
sleeping peacefully. The whispering 
is a hardly audible wheep, wheep 
from an electric clock. (It was 
knocked to the floor once. A gear 
is slightly off axis; it rubs against 
a rivet.) The whir is another clock. 
If you look more carefully, you 
will find that there are more clocks. 
There are five clocks in this 



FIRST OF TWO PARTS 



room, all told. They all have 
alarms, set to ring at the same 
moment. 

Cornut is a good-looking man, 
even if he is a little pale. If you 
are a woman (say, one of the girls 
in his classes), you would like to 
get him out in the sun. You would 
like to fatten him up and make him 
laugh more. He "is not aware that 
he needs sunshine or fattening, but 
he is very much aware that he 
needs something. 

He knows something is wrong. 
He has known this for seven weeks, 
on the best evidence of all. 

The five clocks march briskly 
toward seven-fifteen, the time at 
which they are set to go off. Cornut 
has spent a lot of time arranging 
it so that they will sound at the 
same moment. He set the alarm 
dial on each, checked it by revolv- 
ing the hands of the clocks them- 
selves to make note of the exact 
second at which the trigger went 
off, painfully reset and rechecked. 
They are now guaranteed to ring, 
clang or buzz within a quarter- 
minute of each other. 

However, one of them has a bad 
habit. It is the one that Cornut 
dropped once. It makes a faint 
click a few moments before the 
alarm itself rings. 

It clicks now. 

The sound is not very loud, but 
Cornut stirs. His eyes flicker. They 
close again, but he is not quite 
asleep. 



After a moment he pushes back 
the covers and sits up. His eyes are 
still almost closed. 

Suppose you are a picture on his 
wall — perhaps the portrait of 
Leibnitz, taken from Ficquet’s old 
engraving. Out of the eyes under 
your great curled wig, you see this 
young man stand up and walk 
slowly toward his window. 

His room is eighteen stories up. 

If a picture on the wall can re- 
member, you remember that this 
is not the first time. If a picture on 
the wall can know things, you know 
that he has tried to leap out of that 
window before, and he is about to 
try again. 

He is trying to kill himself. He 
has tried nine times in the past fifty 
days. 

If a picture on a wall can regret, 
you regret this. It is a terrible waste 
for this man to keep trying to kill 
himself, for he does not at all want 
to die. 

II 

C ORNUT was uncomfortable in 
his sleep. He felt drowsily 
that he had worked himself into 
an awkward position, and besides, 
someone was calling his name. He 
mumbled, grimaced, opened his 
eyes. 

He was looking straight down, 
nearly two hundred feet. 

At once he was fully awake. He 
teetered dangerously, but someone 



10 



GALAXY 




behind him had caught him by an 
arm, someone shouting. Whoever 
it was, he pulled Cornut roughly 
back into the room. 

At that moment the five alarm 
clocks burst into sound, like a well- 
drilled chorus; a beat later the 
phone by his bed rang; the room 
lights sprang into life, controlled 
by their automatic timer, one read- 
ing lamp turned and fitted with a 
new, brighter tube so that it be- 
came a spotlight aimed at the pil- 
low where Cornut’s head should 
have been. 

“Are you all right?” 

The question had been repeated 
several times, Cornut realized. He 
said furiously, “Of course I’m all 
right!” It had been very close; his 
veins were suddenly full of adrena- 
lin, and as there was nothing else 
for it to do, it charged him with 
anger . “I’m sorry. Thanks, 
Egerd.” 

The undergraduate let go. He 
was nineteen years old, with crew- 
cut red hair and a face, normally 
deeply tanned, that was now al- 
most white. “That’s all right.” He 
cautiously backed to the ringing 
phone, still watching the professor. 
“Hello. Yes, he’s awake now. 
Thanks for calling.” 

“Almost too late,” said Cornut, 
“alarms, lights, phone, you . .” 
“I’d better get back, sir. I’ll have 
to — oh, good morning, Master 
Carl.” 

The house master was standing 



in the doorway, a gaggle of under- 
graduates clustered behind him 
like young geese, staring in to see 
what all the commotion was. Mas- 
ter Carl was tall, black-haired, with 
eyes like star sapphires. He stood 
holding a wet photographic nega- 
tive that dripped gently onto the 
rubber tiles. “What the devil is go- 
ing on here?” he demanded. 

Cornut opened his mouth to an- 
swer, and then realized how utter- 
ly impossible it was for him to 
answer that question. He didn’t 
know! The terrible thing about the 
last fifty days was just that. He 
didn’t know what; he didn’t know 
why; all he knew was that this was 
the ninth time he had very nearly 
taken his own life. 

“Answer Master Carl, Egerd,” 
he said. 

r T' HE undergraduate jumped. 

■*- Carl was the central figure in 
his life; every student’s hope of 
passing, of graduating, of avoiding 
the military draft or forced labor 
in the Assigned Camps lay in his 
house master’s whim. 

Egerd said, stammering, “Sir, I 
— I have been on extra duty for 
Master Cornut. He asked me to 
come in each morning five minutes 
before wake-up time and observe 
him, because he — That is, that’s 
what he asked me to do. This 
morning I was a little late.” 

Carl said coldly, “You were 
late?” 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



11 




“Yes, sir. I — * 

“And you came into the corridor 
without shaving ?” 

The undergraduate was struck 
dumb. The cluster of students be- 
hind Carl briskly dissolved. Egerd 
started to speak, but Cornut cut in. 
He sat down shakily on the edge 
of his bed. “Leave the boy alone, 
will you, Carl? If he had taken time 
to shave, I’d be dead.” 

Master Carl rapped out, “Very 
well. You may go to your room, 
Egerd. Cornut, I want to know 
what this is all about. I intend to 
get a full explanation . .” He 
paused, as though remembering 
something. He glanced down at the 
wet negative in his hand. 

“As soon as we’ve had breakfast,” 
he said grimly, and stalked back to 
his own rooms. 

Cornut dressed heavily and be- 
gan to shave. He had aged a full 
year every day of the past seven 
weeks; on that basis, he calculated, 
he was already pushing eighty, a 
full decade older than Master Carl 
himself. Seven weeks, and nine 
attempts at suicide. 

And no explanation. 

He didn’t look like a man who 
had just sleepwalked himself to 
the narrow edge of suicide. He was 
young for a professor and built like 
an athlete, which was according to 
the facts; he had been captain of 
the fencing team as an undergradu- 
ate, and was its faculty advisor still. 
His face looked like the face of a 



husky, healthy youth who for some 
reason had been cutting himself 
short on sleep, and that was also 
according to the facts. His expres- 
sion was that of a man deeply 
embarrassed by some incredibly 
inexcusable act he has just com- 
mitted. And that fit the facts too. 

Cornut was embarrassed. His 
foolishness would be all over the 
campus by now; undoubtedly there 
had been whispers before, but this 
morning’s episode had had many 
witnesses and the whispers would 
be quite loud. As the campus was 
Cornut’s whole life, that meant 
that every living human being 
whose opinion counted with him 
at all would soon be aware that he 
was recklessly trying to commit 
suicide — for no reason — and not 
even succeeding ! 

TT E dried his face and got ready 
to leave his room — which 
meant facing everybody, but there 
was no way out of that. 

A bundle of letters and mem- 
oranda was in the mail hopper by 
his desk. He paused to look at 
them: nothing important. 

He glanced at his notes, which 
someone had been straightening. 
Probably Egerd. Cornut’s scrawled 
figures on the Wolgren anomaly 
were neatly stacked on top of the 
schema for this morning’s lectures. 
In the center of the desk, with a 
paperweight on top of it, was the 
red-bordered letter from the presi- 



12 



GALAXY 




dent’s office, inviting him to go on 
the Field Expedition. 

He reminded himself to ask Carl 
to get him off that. He had too 
much to do to waste time on purely 
social trips. The Wolgren study 
alone would keep him busy for 
weeks, and Carl was always press- 
ing him to publish. But trying to 
get off the Field Expedition was 
premature. Three months from 
now . maybe ... if Computer 
Section allocated enough time, and 
if the anomalies didn’t disappear in 
someone’s long-past error in simple 
addition. 

And if he was still alive, of 
course. 

“Oh, damn it all, anyhow!” Cor- 
nut said. He tucked the president’s 
letter into his pocket, picked up his 
cape and walked out irritably. 

The Math Tower dining room 
served all thirty-one masters of the 
Department, and most of them 
were there before him. He walked 
in with an impassive fgce, expect- 
ing a sudden hush to stop the 
permanent buzz of conversation in 
the hall. It did. Everyone was look- 
ing at him. 

“Good morning,” he said cheer- 
fully. 

One of the few women on the 
staff waved to him, giggling. “Good 
for you, Cornut! Come sit with us, 
will you? Janet has an idea to help 
you stop suiciding!” 

Cornut smiled and turned his 
back on the two women. They slept 



in the women’s wing, of course, 
twelve stories below his own dorms, 
but already the word had spread. 
Naturally. 

He stopped at the table where 
Master Carl sat alone, drinking tea 
and looking through a sheaf of 
photographs. “I’m sorry about this 
morning, Carl,” he said. 

Master Carl looked vaguely up 
at him. With his equals, Carl’s eyes 
were not the star sapphires that 
had pierced Egerd; they were the 
mild, blue eyes of a lean Santa 
Claus, which was much closer to his 
true nature. “Oh? Oh. You mean 
about jumping out of the window. 
Sit down.” He made a space on 
the table for the student waitress 
to put down Cornut’s place-setting. 
The whole cloth was covered with 
photographic prints. He handed 
one to Cornut. “Tell me,” he said 
apologetically, “does that look like 
a picture of a star to you?” 

“No.” Cornut was not very in- 
terested in his department head’s 
hobbies. The print looked like a 
light-struck blob of nothing much 
at all. 

Carl sighed and put it down. “All 
right. Now, what about this thing 
this morning?” 

Cornut accepted a cup of coffee 
from one of the student waitresses 
and waved away the others. “I wish 
I could,” he said seriously. 

Carl waited. 

“I mean — it’s hard,” said Cornut. 

Carl waited. 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



13 




C ORNUT took a long swallow 
of coffee and put down his 
cup. Carl was probably the only 
man on the faculty who hadn’t 
been, listening to the grapevine. It 
was almost impossible to say to him 
the simple fact of what had hap- 
pened. Master Carl was a child of 
the University, just as Cornut him- 
self was; like Cornut, he had been 
born in the University’s medical 
center and educated in the Univer- 
sity’s schools. He had no taste for 
the boiling, bustling Townie world 
outside. In fact, he had very little 
taste for human problems at all. 
Lord knew what Carl, dry as digits, 
his head crammed with Vinogradoff 
and Frenicle de Bessy, would make 
of so non-mathematical a phenom- 
enon as suicide. 

“I’ve tried to kill myself nine 
times,” Cornut said, plunging in. 
“Don’t ask me why; I don’t know. 
That’s what this morning was all 
about. It was my ninth try.” 
Master Carl’s expression was ex- 
actly what Cornut had anticipated. 

“Don’t look so incredulous!” 
Cornut snapped. “I don’t know any 
more about it than that. It’s at least 
as much of an annoyance to me as 
it is to you!” 

The house master looked help- 
lessly at the photographic prints 
by his plate, as though some answer 
might be there. It wasn’t. “All 
right,” he said, rubbing the lobes 
of bone over his eyes. “I understand 
your statement. Has it occurred to 



you that you might get help?” 

“Help? My God, I’ve got helpers 
all over the place! The thing is 
worst in the morning, you see; just 
when I’m waking up, not fully alert, 
that’s the bad time. So I’ve set up 
a whole complicated system of 
alarms. I have five clocks set; I got 
the superintendent’s office to rig 
up the lights on a timed switch; I 
got the night proctor to call me on 
the house phone — all of them to- 
gether, so that when I wake up, I 
wake up totally. It worked for 
three mornings, and, believe me, 
the only thing that the experience 
resembles is being awakened by a 
pot of ice water in the face. I even 
got Egerd to come in every morn- 
ing to stand by while I woke, just 
on the chance that something might 
go wrong.” 

“But this morning Egerd was 
late?” 

“He was tardy,” Cornut correct- 
ed. “A minute or two more and he 
would have been late, all right. And 
so would I.” 

Carl said, “That’s not exactly the 
sort of help I had in mind.” 

“You mean the Med Center?” 
Cornut reached foi a cigarette. A 
student waitress hurried over with 
a light. She was in one of his classes; 
a girl named Locille. She was pretty 
and very young. Cornut said ab- 
sently, following her with his eyes, 
“I’ve been there, Carl. They offered 
me analysis. In fact, they were quite 
insistent.”

GALAXY 




1VT ASTER Carl’s face was lumi- 
nous with interest. Cornut, 
turning back to look at him, thought 
that he hadn’t seen Carl quite so 
absorbed in anything since their 
last discussion about the paper Cor- 
nut was doing for him: the analysis 
of the discrepancies in Wolgren’s 
basic statistical law. 

Carl said, “I’ll tell you what 
astonishes me. You don’t seem very 
worried about all this.” 

Cornut reflected. “. I am, 
though.” 

“You don’t show it. Well, is there 
anything else that’s worrying you?” 
“Worried enough to kill myself? 
No. But I suppose there must be, 
mustn’t there? The evidence speaks 
for itself.” 

Carl stared into the empty air. 
The eyes were bright blue again; 
Master Carl was operating with his 
brain, examining possibilities, con- 
sidering their relevancy, evolving 
a theory. “Only in the mornings?” 
“Oh, no, Carl. I’m much more 
versatile than that! I can try to kill 
myself at any hour of the day or 
night. But it happens when I’m 
drowsy. Going to sleep, waking up 
— once, in the middle of the night, 
I found myself walking toward the 
fire stairs, God knows why. Perhaps 
something happened to half-wake 
me, I don’t know. So I have Egerd 
keep me company at night until 
I’m thoroughly asleep, and again 
in the morning. He’s my — baby- 
sitter.” 



Carl said testily, “Surely you can 
tell me more than this!” 

‘Well ... Yes, I suppose I can. 
I think I have dreams.” 
“Dreams?” 

“I think so, Carl. I don’t remem- 
ber very well, but it’s as though 
someone were telling me to do 
these things, someone in a position 
of authority. A father? I don’t re- 
member my own father, but that’s 
the feeling I get.” 

The light went out of Carl’s face. 
He had lost interest. 

Cornut said curiously, “What’s 
the matter?” 

The house master leaned back, 
shaking his head. “No, it’s falla- 
cious to believe someone is telling 
you, Cornut. There isn’t anyone. 
I’ve checked the matter of dreams 
very thoroughly. Dreams come 
from the dreamer.” 

“But I only said — ” 

Master Carl held up his hand. 
“To consider any other possibili- 
ty,” he lectured, in the voice that 
reached three million viewers every 
week, “involves one of two possi- 
bilities. First, there might be a 
physical explanation. That is, some- 
one may actually be speaking to 
you as you sleep. That isn’t very 
likely, now is it? The second pos- 
sibility is telepathy. And that,” he 
said sadly, “does not exist.” 

“But I only - ” 

“Look within yourself, my boy,” 
the old man said wisely. Then, his 
expression showing interest again, 



DRUNKARD'S WALK

“And what about Wolgren? Any 
progress with the anomalies?” 

F IFTEEN minutes later, on the 
plea that he was late for an 
appointment, Cornut made his es- 
cape. There were twelve tables in 
the room and he was invited to sit 
down at eight of them for a second 
cup of coffee . and, oh yes, what 
is this story all about, Cornut? 

His appointment, although he 
hadn’t said so to Master Carl, was 
with his analyst. Cornut was anx- 
ious to keep it. 

He wasn’t very confident of an- 
alysis as a solution to his problem. 
Despite three centuries, the tech- 
niques of mental health had, never 
evolved a rigorous proof system, 
and Cornut was skeptical of what- 
ever was not susceptible of mathe- 
matical analysis. But there was 
something else he had neglected to 
tell Master Carl. 

Cornut was not the only one of 
his kind. 

The man at the Med Center had 
been quite excited. He named five 
names that Cornut recognized, 
faculty members who had died in 
ambiguous circumstances within 
the past few years. One had made 
fifteen attempts before he finally 
succeeded in blowing himself up 
after an all-night polymerization 
experiment in the Chem Hall. A 
couple had succeeded on the first 
or second try. 

What made Cornut exceptional 



was that he had got through seven 
weeks of this without even serious- 
ly maiming himself. The all-time 
record was ten weeks. That was the 
chemist. 

The analyst had promised to 
have all the information about the 
other suiciders to show him this 
morning. Cornut could not deny 
that he wanted to see the data. In- 
deed, it was a matter of consider- 
able concern. 

Unless all precedent was wrong, 
he would succeed as all the others 
had ultimately succeeded. He 
would kill himself one way or an- 
other, and it was unlikely that he 
ever would know why he had done 
it. 

And unless precedent was wrong 
again, it would happen within the 
next three weeks. 

Ill 

r T'HE University was beginning 
its day. In the Regents Office, 
a clerk filled a hopper and flipped 
a switch, and Sticky Dick — some- 
times written as S. T.-I (C.E.), Di. 
C. — began to grind out grades on 
the previous day’s examinations in 
English, Sanskrit and the nuclear 
reactions of the Bethe Phoenix 
cycle. Student orderlies in Med 
School wheeled their sectioned 
cadavers out of the refrigerated 
filing drawers, playing the time- 
honored ribald jokes with the de- 
tached parts. In the central Tape 



16 



GALAXY 




Room, the TV technicians went 
about their endless arcane ritual of 
testing circuits and balancing volt- 
ages; every lecture was put on 
tape as a matter of course, even 
those which were not either broad- 
cast or syndicated. 

Thirty thousand undergraduates 
ran hastily over the probable mood 
of their various instructors, and 
came to the conclusion that they 
would be lucky to live through to 
evening. But it was better than try- 
ing to get along in the outside 
world, the Townie world. 

And in the kitchen attached to 
the faculty dining room of Math 
Tower, the student waitress, Lo- 
cille, helped a Culinary Engineer 
mop the last drops off the stainless 
steel cooking utensils. She hung up 
her apron, checked her makeup in 
the mirror by the door, descended 
in the service elevator and went 
out to the hot, loud walks of the 
Quad. 

Locille didn’t think them either 
hot or loud. She had known much 
worse. 

Locille was a scholarship girl; 
her parents were Town, not Gown. 
She had been at the University for 
only two years. She still spent some 
of her weekends at home. She knew 
very clearly what it was like to 
live in the city across the bay — 
or, worse, to live on one of the tex- 
ases off the coast — with your 
whole life a rattling, banging 
clamor day and night and everyone 



piled up against everyone else. The 
noise in the Quadrangle was hu- 
man noise and the ground did not 
shake. 

Locille had a happy small face, 
short hair, a forthright way of walk- 
ing out. She did not look worried, 
but she was. He had looked so 
tired this morning! Also he wasn’t 
eating, and that was not like him. 
If it wasn’t scrambled eggs and 
bacon, it was a hot cereal with 
fruit on top, always. Perhaps, she 
planned, smiling at a boy who 
greeted her without really seeing 
his face at all, tomorrow she would 
just bring the scrambled eggs and 
put them in front of him. Probably 
he’d eat them. 

Of course, that wasn’t getting at 
the real problem. 

Locille shivered. She felt help- 
less. It was distressing to care so 
much what happened to someone, 
and be so far outside the situation 
itself . 

T> UNNING footsteps came up 
behind her and slowed. “Hi,” 
panted her most regular date, 
Egerd, falling into step. “Why 
didn’t you wait at the door? What 
about Saturday night?” 

“I don’t know yet. They might 
need me at the faculty dance.” 

Egerd said brusquely, “Tell 
them you can’t make it. You have 
to go out to the texas. Your brother 
has, uh, some disease or other, and 
your mother needs you.” 



DRUNKARD'S WALK 



17 




Locille laughed. 

“Aw, look. I’ve got Carnegan’s 
boat for the evening! We can go 
clear down to the Hook.” 

Locille willingly let him take 
her hand. She liked Egerd. He was 
a good-looking boy and he was 
kind. He reminded her of her 
brother . well, not of her real 
brother, but the brother she should 
have had. She liked Egerd. But she 
didn’t like him. The distinction was 
quite clear in her mind. Egerd, for 
example, obviously liked her. 

Egerd said, “Well, you don’t have 
to make up your mind now. I’ll ask 
you again tomorrow.” That was a 
salesman’s instinct operating; it 
was always better to leave the pros- 
pect with a “maybe” than a “no.” 

He guided her between two tall 
buildings toward the back gardens 
of the campus, where Agronomy 
had made a little Japanese retreat 
in the middle of fifteen intensively 
farmed acres of experimental peas 
and wheat. 

“I think I got some demerits 
from old Carl this morning,” he 
said gloomily. 

‘Too bad,” Locille said, al- 
though that was not an unusual 
phenomenon. But then he caught 
her attention. 

“I was just trying to do Cornut 
a favor. Trying? Hell, I saved his 
life!” She was all attention now. 
“He was practically out the win- 
dow. Loopy! You know, I think 
half of these professors are off their 

18 



rockets. Anyway, if I hadn’t got 
there when I did, he would’ve been 
dead. Splop. All over the Quad. At 
that,” he said cheerfully, “I was 
kind of late.” 

“Egerd!” 

He stopped and looked at her. 
“What’s the matter?” 

“You shouldn’t have been late! 
Didn’t you know Master Cornut 
was relying on you? Really! That 
was awful of you!” 

She was actually angry. Egerd 
studied her thoughtfully and 
stopped talking; some of the pleas- 
ure had gone out of the morning 
for him. Abruptly he caught her 
arm. 

“Locille,” he said in a complete- 
ly serious tone, “please marry me 
for a while. I know I’m here on a 
scholarship and my grades are mar- 
ginal. But I won’t go back. Listen, 
I’m not going to stay with Math. 
I was talking to some of the fellows 
at Med School. There’s a lot of 
jobs in epidemiology, and that way 
my Math credits will do me some 
good. I’m not asking for ten years 
of your life. We can make it month 
to month, even, and if you don’t opt 
for a renewal, I swear I won’t hold 
it against you. But let me try to 
make you want to stay with me, 
Locille. Please. Marry me.” 

He stood looking down at her, 
his broad, tanned face entirely 
open, waiting. She didn’t meet his 
eye. 

After a moment he nodded com- 
GALAXY 




posed ly. “I can’t compete with 
Master Comut, can I?” 

She suddenly frowned. “Egerd, 
I hope you won’t feel — I mean, 
just because you’ve got the idea 
I’m interested in Master Cornut, I 
hope—” 

“No,” he said, grinning, “I won’t 
let him dive out a window. But you 
know something? You’re a very 
pretty girl, Locille, but I don’t 
think Cornut knows you’re alive.” 

r T> HE analyst followed Cornut to 
the door. He was frustrated and 
not concealing his frustration. 

Comut said stiffly, “Sorry, but I 
won’t put everything else aside.” 
“You’ll have to, if you succeed 
in killing yourself.” 

“That’s what you’re supposed to 
prevent, isn’t it? Or is this whole 
thing a complete waste of time?” 
“It’s better than suicide.” 

Comut shrugged. It was a logi- 
cally impeccable point. 

“Won’t you even stay over- 
night? Observation might give us 
the answer.” 

“No.” 

The analyst hesitated, shook his 
head, shook hands. “All right. I 
guess you know that if I had my 
way, I wouldn’t be asking you. I’d 
commit you to Med Center.” 

“Of course you would,” Comut 
said. “But you don’t have your way, 
do you? You’ve tried to get an or- 
der from the president’s office al- 
ready, haven’t you?” 



The analyst had the grace to 
look embarrassed. “Front office in- 
terference. You’d think they’d un- 
derstand that Mental Health 
needs a little cooperation once in 
a while . .” 

Comut left him still muttering. 
As he stepped out onto the Quad, 
the heat and noise struck him. He 
didn’t mind, either; he was used to 
it. 

He had recovered enough to 
think of the morning’s escape with 
amusement The feeling was wry, 
with a taste of worry to it, but he 
was able to see the funny side. And 
it was ridiculous, no doubt about it 
Suicide! Miserable people commit- 
ted suicide, not happy ones, and 
Cornut was a perfectly happy man. 

Even the analyst had as much as 
admitted that. It had been a total 
waste of time, making Comut dig 
and dig into his cloudy childhood 
recollections for some early, ab- 
scessed wound of the mind that 
was pouring poisons out of its 
secret hiding place. He didn’t have 
any! How could he? He was Gown. 
His parents had been on the facul- 
ty of this very University. Before 
he could walk, he was given over 
to the creches and the playschools, 
run by the best-trained experts in 
the world, organized according to 
the best principles of child guid- 
ance. Trauma? There simply 
could not be any! 

Not only was it impossible on 
the face of it, but Comufs whole

personality showed no sign of such 
a thing. He enjoyed his work very 
much, and although he knew there 
was something he lacked — a se- 
cure love — he also knew that in 
time he would have it. 

“Good morning, good morning,” 
he said civilly to the knots of un- 
dergraduates on the walks. He be- 
gan to whistle one of Carl’s 
mnemonic songs. The undergradu- 
ates who nodded to him smiled. 
Cornut was a highly popular pro- 
fessor. 

He passed the Hall of Humani- 
ties, the Lit Building, Pre-Med 
and the Administration Tower. As 
he got farther from home ground, 
the number of students who 
greeted him became smaller, but 
they still nodded politely to the 
Master’s cloak. Overhead, the 
shriek of distant passing aircraft 
filled the sky. 

The great steel sweep of the Bay 
Bridge was behind him now, but 
he could still hear the unending 
rush of cars across it and, farther 
and louder, the growl of the city. 

Cornut paused at the door of the 
studio where he was to deliver his 
first lecture. 

He glanced across the narrow 
strait at the city. There was a mys- 
tery. 

It was, he thought, a problem 
greater than the silent murderer 
in his own brain. But it was not a 
problem he would ever have to 
solve. 

20 



(,(, k GOOD teacher is a good 
makeup man.” That was 
one of Master Carl’s maxims. Cor- 
nut sat down at the long table and 
methodically applied a daub of 
neutral-colored base to each cheek- 
bone. The camera crew began 
sighting in on him as he worked 
the cream into his skin, down from 
the bone and away. 

“Need any help?” 

Cornut looked up and saw his 
producer. “No, thanks.” He brought 
the corners of his eyebrows down 
a fraction of an inch. 

The clock was clicking off half- 
seconds. Cornut penciled in age- 
lines (that was the price you paid 
for being a full professor at thirty) 
and then brushed on the lip color. 
He leaned forward to examine him- 
self more closely in the mirror, but 
the producer stopped him. “Just a 
minute! Dammit, man, not so much 
red!” 

The cameraman turned a dial. 
In the monitor, Cornut’s image ap- 
peared a touch paler, a touch 
greener. 

“That’s better. All done, Profes- 
sor?” 

Cornut wiped his fingers on a 
tissue and set the golden wig on his 
head. “All done,” he said, rising 
just as the minute hand touched 
the hour of ten. 

From a grille at the top of the 
screen that dominated the front 
of the studio came the sounds of 
his theme music, muted for the 

GAUA.XY 




studio audience. Cornut took his 
place in front of the class, bowed, 
nodded, smiled, and pressed the 
pedal of the prompter until he 
found his place. 

He had more than a hundred 
students physically present. Cor- 
nut liked a large flesh-and-blood 
enrollment — because he was a tra- 
ditionalist, but even more because 
he could tell from their faces how 
well he was getting across. This 
class was one of his favorites. They 
responded to his mood, but with- 
out ever overdoing. They didn’t 
laugh too loudly when he made a 
conventional academic joke; they 
didn’t cough or murmur. They 
never distracted the attention of 
the huger, wider broadcast audi- 
ence from himself. 

Cornut looked over the class 
while the announcer was finishing 
the intro to the broadcast watch- 
ers. He saw Egerd, looking upset 
and irritable about something, 
whispering to the girl from the 
faculty dining room. What was her 
name? Locille. Lucky fellow, Cor- 
nut thought absently to himself, 
and then the Binomial Theorem 
entered his mind — it was never far 
away — and displaced everything 
else. 

“Good morning,” he said, “and 
let’s get to work. Today we’re go- 
ing to take up the relationship of 
Pascal’s Triangle to the Binomial 
Theorem.” A sting of organ music 
rode in under his words. 



Behind him, on the monitor, the 
symbols p + q appeared in letters 
of golden fire. 

“I presume you all remember 
what the Binomial Theorem is — 
unless you’ve been cutting your 
classes.” Very small laugh— actual- 
ly a sort of sub-aural grunt, just 
about what the very small jocular 
remark deserved. “The expansion 
of p plus q is, of course, its square, 
cube, fourth power and so on.” Be- 
hind him an invisible hand began 
multiplying p + q by itself in 
bright gold. “P plus q squared is 
p -squared plus two pq plus q- 
squared. P plus q cubed—” The 
writer in gold noted the sum as he 
spoke: p 3 -f- 3p 2 q + 3 pq- + q 3 . 

“That’s simple enough, isn’t it?” 
He paused; then, deadpan, “Well, 
then, how come Sticky Dick says 
fifteen per cent of you missed it in 
the last test?” A warmer giggle, 
punctuated with a couple of loud, 
embarrassed hee-haws from the 
back. Oh, they were a very fine 
class. 

HP HE letters and numbers wiped 
themselves from the screen 
and a little red-faced comic car- 
toon figure of a bricklayer dropped 
into view and began building a 
pyramid of bricks : 




DRUNKARD’S WALK 



21 




“Now, forget about the theorem 
for a moment. That won’t be hard 
for some of you.” Small giggle 
which he rode over. “Consider Pas- 
cal’s Triangle. We build it just like 
a brick wall, only . Hold it a 
minute there, friend.” The cartoon 
bricklayer paused and looked curi- 
ously out at the audience. “Only 
we don’t start from the bottom. We 
build it from the top down.” The 
cartoon bricklayer did a comic 
pratfall in astonishment. Then, 
shrugging, he got up, erased the old 
wall with a sweep of his trowel, 
hung a brick in space and began 
building a triangle under it. 

“And we don’t do it with bricks,” 
added Cornut. “We do it with 
numbers.” 

The bricklayer straightened up, 
kicked the wall off the screen and 
followed after it, pausing just at 
the rim of visibility to stick his 
tongue out at Cornut. The monitor 
went to a film with live models, 
cartwheeling into view along the 

banks of seats of the university’s 

football stadium, each model car- 
rying a placard with a number, ar- 
ranging themselves in a Pascal Tri- 
angle: 

1 1 
1 2 1 

13 3 1 

1 4 6 4 1 

1 5 10 10 5 1 

Cornut turned to relish the con- 
struction Pascal had first written 

22 



down, centuries before. “You will 
note,” he said, “that each number 
is the sum of the two terms nearest 
in the line above it. The Pascal Tri- 
angle is more than a pretty pattern. 
It represents—” 

Cornut picked up the ivory- 
tipped pointer that lay on his desk, 
clustered with the ceremonial desk 
furnishings of the instructor — pa- 
per cutter, shears, pencils, all there 
for appearance — and, with the aid 
of every audio-visual help possible 
to Man, began explaining to three 
million viewers the relation be- 
tween Pascal’s Triangle and the 
binomial distribution. 

VERY line on Cornut’s face, 
every word, every posturing 
ballet dancer or animated digit 
that showed itself on the monitor 
behind him was caught in the tubes 
of the cameras, converted into 
high-frequency pulses and hurled 
out at the world. 

Cornut had more than a hun- 
dred live watchers — the cream; 
the chosen ones who were allowed 
to attend University in person — 
but his viewers altogether num- 
bered three million. In the relay 
tower at Fort Monmouth, a senior 
shift engineer named Sam Gensel 
watched with concentrated atten- 
tion as across the dimpled tummies 
of the five girls in the fourth line of 
the Pascal Triangle electronics su- 
perimposed the symbols: 
p 4 + 4p 3 q + 6p 2 q 2 + 4pq 3 + q 4 

GALAXY 




He was not interested in the aston- 
ishing fact that the sign of the five 
terms in the expansion of (p + q) 4 
were 1, 4, 6, 4 and 1 — the same as 
the numbers in the fourth line of 
the Triangle — but he cared very 
much that the image was a trifle 
fuzzy. He twisted a vernier, 
scowled, turned it back, threw 
switches that called in an alternate 
circuit, and was rewarded by a 
crisper, clearer image. At some re- 
lay point, a tube was failing. He 
picked up the phone to call the 
maintenance crew. 

The crisper, clearer signal was 
beamed up to the handiest televi- 
sion-relay satellite and showered 
back down on the world. 

On the Sandy Hook texas, a boy 
named Roger Hoskins, smelling 
seriously of fish, paused by the 
door of his room to watch. He di4 
not care about mathematics, but 
he was a faithful viewer; his sister 
was in the class, and Mom was al- 
ways grateful when he could tell 
her that he’d caught a glimpse of 
their very fortunate, very seldom 
encountered daughter. 

In a creche over Lower Man- 
hattan, three toddlers munched 
fibrous crackers and watched; the 
harried nursery teacher had dis- 
covered that the moving colors 
kept them quiet. 

On the twenty-fifth floor of a 
tenement on Staten Island, a 
monocar motorman named Frank 
Moran sat in front of his set while 



Cornut reviewed Pascal’s thesis. 
Moran did not get much benefit 
from it. He had just come off the 
night shift. He was asleep. 

There were many of them, the 
accidental or disinterested dialers- 
in. But there were more, there were 
thousands, there were uncounted 
hundreds of thousands who were 
following the proceedings with ab- 
sorption. 

For education was something 
very precious indeed. 

The thirty thousand at the Uni- 
versity were the lucky ones; they 
had passed the tests, stiffer every 
year. Not one out of a thousand 
passed those tests. It wasn’t only a 
matter of intelligence; it was a 
matter of having the talents that 
could make a University education 
fruitful — in terms of society. For 
the world had to work. The world 
was too big to be idle. The land 
that had fed mere millions of peo- 
ple now had to feed twelve billion. 

ORNUT’S television audience 
^ could, if it wished, take tests 
and accumulate credits. That was 
what Sticky Dick was for; elec- 
tronically, it graded papers, sup- 
plied term averages and awarded 
diplomas for students no professor 
ever saw. Almost always the 
credits led nowhere. But to those 
trapped in dreary production or 
drearier caretaker jobs for society, 
the hope was important. 

There was a young man named 

23 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 




Max Steck, for example, who had 
already made a small contribution 
to the theory of normed rings. It 
was not enough. Sticky Dick said 
he would not justify a career in 
mathematics. There were thou- 
sands of Max Stecks. 

Then there was Charles Bing- 
ham. He was a reactor hand at the 
14th Street generating plant. 
Mathematics might help him, in 
time, become a supervising engi- 
neer. It also might not — the candi- 
dates for that job were already 
lined up a hundred deep. But there 
were half a million Charles Bing- 
hams. 

Sue-Ann Flood was the daugh- 
ter of a farmer. Her father drove 
a helipopper, skimming the plowed 
fields, seeding, spraying, fertilizing, 
and he knew that the time she put 
in on college-level studies would 
not help her gain admittance to 
the University. Sue-Ann knew it 
too. But she was only fourteen 
years old and she could hope. 
There were more than two million 
like Sue-Ann, and every one of 
them knew that all the others 
would be disappointed. 

Those, the millions of them, 
were the invisible audience who 
watched Master Cornut’s busy 
image on a cathode screen. But 
there were others. One watched 
from Bogota and one from Buenos 
Aires. One in Saskatchewan said, 
“You goofed this morning,” and 
one flying high over the Rockies 



said, “Can’t we try him now?” And 
one was propped on soft pillows in 
front of a set not more than a quar- 
ter of a mile from Cornut himself; 
and he said, “It’s worth a try. The 
son of a bitch is getting in my hair.” 

T T was not the easiest task ever 
given Man, to explain the re- 
lationship between the Pascal Tri- 
angle and the binomial distribu- 
tion, but Cornut was succeeding. 
Master Carl’s little mnemonic jin- 
gles helped, and what helped most 
was the utter joy Cornut took 
in it all. It was, after all, his life. As 
he led the class, he felt again the 
wonder he himself had felt, sitting 
in a class like this one. 

He hardly heard the buzz from 
the class as he put his pointer down 
to gesture, and blindly picked it 
up again, still talking. Teaching 
mathematics was a kind of hyp- 
nosis for him, an intense absorp- 
tion that had gripped him from the 
time of his first math class. That 
was what Sticky Dick had meas- 
ured, and that was why Cornut was 
a full professor at his age. It 
was a wonder that so strange a 
thing as numbers should exist in 
the first place, rivaled only by the 
greater wonder that they should 
perform so obediently the work of 
mankind. 

The class buzzed and whispered. 

It struck Cornut cloudily that 
they were whispering more than 
usual.

He looked up absent-mindedly. 
There was an itch at the base of 
his throat. He scratched it with the 
tip of the pointer, half distracted 
from the point he was trying to 
make. But the taped visual aids on 
the screen were timed just so and 
he could not falter. He picked up 
the thread of what he was saying. 
Itch and buzz faded out of his 
mind . 

Then he faltered again. 

Something was wrong. The class 
was buzzing louder. The students 
in the first row were staring at him 
with a unanimous, unprecedented 
expression. The itch returned com- 
pellingly. He scratched at it. It still 
itched. He dug at it with the 
pointer. 

No. Not with the pointer. Fun- 
ny, he thought, there was the 
pointer on his desk. 

Suddenly his throat hurt very 
much. 

“Master Cornut, stop!” screamed 
someone — a girl. Tardily he recog- 
nized the voice, Locille’s voice, as 
she leaped to her feet, and half the 
class with her. His throat was a 
quick deep pain, like fire. A warm 
tickling thread slipped across his 
chest — blood! From his throat! 

He stared at the thing in his 
hand, and it was not the pointer at 
all but the letter opener, steel and 
sharp. Confused and panicked, he 
wheeled to gaze at the monitor. 
There was his own face, over a 
throat that bore a slash of blood! 



Three million viewers gasped. 
Half the studio class was boiling 
toward him, Egerd and the girl 
ahead of the rest. 

“Easy, sir! Here, let me—” That 
was Egerd, with a tissue, pressing 
it against the wound. “You’ll be all 
right, sir! It’s only— it was close!” 

Close? He had all but cut his 
jugular vein in two, right in front 
of his class and the watching tele- 
vision world. 

The murderer inside his head 
was getting very strong and sure, 
to brave the light of day. 

IV 

C ORNUT was a marked man — 
literally, now. He had a neat 
white sterile bandage on his throat, 
and the medics had assured him 
that when the bandage was gone, 
there would be a handsome scar. 
They demanded that he stay 
around for a complete psycho- 
medical checkup. He said no. They 
said, “Would you rather be dead?” 
He said he wasn’t going to die. 
They said, “How can you be sure?” 
But, as it turned out, the clinic was 
not going to be free for that sort of 
thing for a couple of hours, and he 
fought his way free. 

He was furious at the medics for 
annoying him, at himself for being 
such a fool, at Egerd for staunch- 
ing the flow of his blood, at Locille 
for seeing it. His patience with the 
world was exhausted. 



DRUNKARD’S WALK

Cornut strode like a beam- 
guided aircar to the Math Tower 
gym, looking neither to left nor 
right, for he knew what he would 
see. Eyes. The eyes of everyone 
on the campus looking at him. 

He found an undergraduate who 
was reasonably willing to mind his 
own business (the boy only looked 
slightly doubtful when Cornuf 
chose his epee, but one glimpse of 
Cornut’s face made his own turp 
into opaque stone), and they 
fenced for a murderous half-hour. 
The medics had told Cornut to be 
sure to rest. Winded and muscles 
aching, he returned to his room to 
do so. 

He spent a long afternoon lying 
on his bed and looking at the ceil- 
ing, thinking, but nothing came of 
it. The whole thing was simply too 
irritating to be borne. 

Medics or not, at a quarter of 
five he put on a clean shirt to keep 
his appointment at the faculty tea. 

The tea was a sort of official 
send-off to the University’s Field 
Expedition. Attendance was com- 
pulsory, especially for those who, 
like Cornut, were supposed to 
make the trip; but that was not 
why he was there. He considered it 
to be his last good chance to get off 
the list. 

There were three hundred per- 
sons in the huge, vaulted room. 
The University conspicuously con- 
sumed space; it was a tradition, 
like the marginal pencilings in all 



the books in the library. Every one 
of the three hundred glanced once 
quickly at Cornut as he came in, 
then away — some with a muffled 
laugh, some with sympathy, the 
worst with an unnatural lack of 
any expression at all. So much for 
the grapevine. 

Damn them, Cornut thought bit- 
terly, you’d think no professor ever 
tried to suicide before. 

He couldn’t help overhearing 
some of the whispers : 

“And that’s at least the seventh 
time. It’s because he’s desperate 
to be Department Head and old 
Carl won’t step down.” 

“Esmeralda! You know you’re 
making that up!” 

ACE flaming, Cornut walked 
briskly past the little knot. It 
was like a fakir’s bed of coals; every 
step seemed to crisp him. But there 
were other things being gossiped 
about at the tea besides him. 

“—want us to get along with a 
fourteen-year-old trevatron. You 
know what the Chinas have? Six 
brand-new ones. And coin silver 
for the windings!” 

“Yes, but there’s six billion of 
them. Per capita, we stack up 
pretty—” 

Cornut felt minutely better. He 
halted in the middle of the drink- 
ing, eating, talking, surging mass 
and looked about for Master Carl. 
He caught sight of him. 1 he de- 
partment head was paying his re- 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



27 




spects to a queer-looking, ancient 
figure — St. Cyr, the president of 
the University. Cornut was star- 
tled. St. Cyr was an old man and 
by his appearance a sick one; it 
was rare to see him at a faculty tea. 
Still, this one was special — and 
anyway, that could make it a lot 
easier to get off the list. 

Cornut pushed his way toward 
them, past a stocky drunk from 
Humanities who was whispering 
ribaldly to a patient student wait- 
ress, and threaded his way through 
a group of anatomists from the 
Med School. 

“Notice what decent cadavers 
we’ve been getting lately? It hasn’t 
been this good since the last shoot- 
ing war. Of course, they’re not 
much good except for geriatrics, 
but that’s selective euthanasia for 
you.” 

“Will you watch what you’re do- 
ing with that martini?” 

Cornut made his way slowly to- 
ward Master Carl and President 
St. Cyr. The closer he got, the 
easier it was to move. There were 
fewer people at St. Cyr’s end of 
the room. He was the central figure 
of the gathering, but the guests did 
not cluster around him. That’s 
the kind of a man he was. 

HP HE kind of man St. Cyr was 
was this: He was the ugliest 
man in the room. 

There were others who were in 
no way handsome — old, or fat, or 

28 



sick — but St. Cyr was something 
special. His face was an artifact of 
ugliness. Deep old scars made a net 
across his face like the flimsy cloth 
that holds a cheese. Surgery? No 
one knew. He had always had 
them. And his skin was a cyanotic 
blue. 

Master Greenlease (Phys 
Chem) and Master Wahl (Anthro- 
pology) were there, Wahl because 
he was too drunk to care whom he 
spoke to, no doubt; Greenlease be- 
cause Carl had him by the elbow 
and would not let him go. 

St. Cyr nodded four times at 
Cornut, like a pendulum. “Nice 
wea-ther,” he said, tolling it like a 
clock. 

“Yes, it is, sir. Excuse me. Master 
Carl-” 

St. Cyr lifted the hand that hung 
by his side and laid it limply in 
Cornut’s hand — it was his version 
of a handshake. He opened his 
seamed mouth and gave the series 
of unvoiced glottal stops that were 
his version of a chuckle. “It will be 
heav-y weath-er for Mast-er 
Wahl,” he said, spacing out the syl- 
lables like an articulate metro- 
nome. It was his version of a joke. 

Cornut gave him a waxen smile 
and a small waxen laugh. The ref- 
erence was to the fact that Wahl, 
too, was scheduled to go on the 
Field Expedition. Cornut didn’t 
think that was funny — not as far 
as he himself was concerned, any- 
way — not when he had so many 



GALAXY 




more urgent things on his mind. 

“Carl,” he said, “excuse me.” But 
Master Carl had other things on 
his mind; he was badgering Green- 
lease for information about molec- 
ular structure, heaven "knew why. 
And also St. Cyr had not removed 
his hand. 

Cornut grumbled internally and 
waited. Wahl was giggling over 
some involved faculty joke to 
which St. Cyr was listening like a 
judge. Cornut spared himself the 
annoyance of listening to it and 
thought about St. Cyr. Queer old 
duck. That was where you started. 
You could acount for some of the 
queerness by, say, a bad heart. That 
would be the reason for the blue- 
ness. But what would be the rea- 
son for not having it operated on? 

And then what about the other 
things? The deadpan expression. 
The lifeless voice, with its firmly 
pronounced terminals “ings” and 
words without a stress syllable any- 
where. St. Cyr talked like a clock- 
work man. Or a deaf one? 

But again, what would be the 
reason for a man allowing himself 
to be deaf? 

Especially a man who owned a 
University, including an 800-bed 
teaching hospital. 

Wahl at .last noticed that Cornut 
was present and punched his 
shoulder — cordially, Cornut de- 
cided, after thought. “Committed 
any good suicides lately, boy?” He 
hiccoughed. “Don’t blame you. 

DRUNKARD’S WALK 



Your fault, President, you know, 
dragging him off to Tahiti with us. 
He doesn’t like Tahiti.” 

Cornut said, with control, “The 
Field Expedition isn’t going to 
Tahiti.” 

Wahl shrugged. “The way us 
anthropologists look at it, one good 
island is like another good island.” 
He even made a joke of his spe- 
cialty! Cornut was appalled. 

St. Cyr seemed neither to notice 
nor to mind. He flopped his hand 
free of Cornut’s and rested it cas- 
ually on Wahl’s weaving shoulder. 
The other hand held the full high- 
ball glass which, Cornut had ob- 
served, always remained full. St. 
Cyr did not drink or smoke (not 
even tobacco), nor had Cornut 
ever seen him give a second look 
to a pretty girl. 

“Lis-ten,” St. Cyr said in his 
slow-march voice, turning Wahl to 
face Carl and the chemist. “This 
is in-ter-est-ing.” 

Z"' 1 ARL was oblivious of the pres- 
^ ident, of Cornut, of everything 
except the fact that the chemist by 
his side knew something that Carl 
himself wanted to know. The in- 
formation was there; he went after 
it. “I don’t seem to make myself 
clear. What I want to know, Green- 
lease, is how I can visualize the 
exact structure of a molecule. Do 
you follow me? For example, what 
color is it?” 

The chemist looked' uncomfort- 

29 




ably at St. Cyr, but St. Cyr was 
apparently absorbed. “Well,” 
Greenlease said. “Uh. The concept 
of color doesn’t apply. Light waves 
are too long.” 

“Ah! I see!” Carl was fascinated. 
“Well, what about the shape? I’ve 
seen those tinker-toy constructions. 
The atoms are little balls and 
they’re held together with plastic 
rods — I suppose they represent 
connecting force. Are they any- 
thing like the real thing?” 

“The connecting force is real 
enough, but you can’t see it — or 
maybe you could, at that.” Green- 
lease, like most of the faculty mem- 
bers present, had had a bit more 
than enough; he was not of a tem- 
per to try to interpret molecular 
forces in tinker-toy terms for pro- 
fessors who, whatever their status 
in number theory, were physical- 
chemical idiots. “Maybe you could, 
that is, if you could see the atoms 
in the first place. One is no more 
impossible than the other. But the 
connecting force would not look 
like a rod, any more than the gravi- 
tation that holds the Moon to the 
Earth would look like a rod . 
Let’s see . Do you know what I 
mean by the word ‘valence’? No. 
Well, do you know enough atomic 
theory to know what part is played 
by the number of electrons in — Or 
look at it a different way.” 

Greenlease paused. By his ex- 
pression, he was getting seriously 
annoyed, in a way he considered 



unjust — like an ivory hunter who, 
carrying a .400 Express in his 
crooked arm, cannot quite see how 
to cope with the attack of a hungry 
mosquito. Greenlease seemed on 
the point of reviewing atomic struc- 
ture back through Bohr and well 
on the way to Democritus. 

“I’ll tell you what,” he said at 
last. “Stop around tomorrow if you 
can. I have some plates made un- 
der the electron-microscope.” 

“Oh, thank you!” cried Carl 
with enthusiasm. “Tomorrow — 
But tomorrow I’ll be off on this 
con—” He smiled at St. Cyr. “To- 
morrow I’ll be with the Field Ex- 
pedition. Well, as soon as I get 
back, Greenlease. Don’t forget.” 
He warmly shook hands and the 
chemist went quickly away. 

Cornut hissed angrily: “That’s 
what I want to talk to you about.” 
Carl looked startled but 
pleased. “I didn’t know you were 
interested in my little experiments, 
Cornut. That was quite fascinating. 
I’ve always thought of a molecule 
of silver nitrate, for example, as 
being black or silvery. Perhaps 
that’s where my work has gone 
wrong. Greenlease says—” 

“No, I’m not talking about that. 
I mean the Field Expedition. I 
can’t go.” 

A N observer a yard away would 
have thought that all of St. 
Cyr’s attention was on Wahl; he 
had lost interest in the dialogue 



30 



GALAXY 




between Carl and Greenlease min- 
utes before. But the old head 
turned like a parabolic mirror. The 
faded blue eyes radared in on 
Cornut. The slow metronome 
ticked: “You must go, Cor-nut.” 
“Must go? Of course you must 
go. Good heavens, Cornut! Don’t 
mind him, President. Certainly 
he’ll go.” 

“But I have all the Wolgren to 
get through—” 

“And then a su-i-cide to com- 
mit.” The muscles at the corner of 
the mouth tried to twitch the blue 
lips upward, to show that it was a 
pleasantry. 

But Cornut was nettled. “Sir, I 
don’t intend to—” 

“You did not intend to this 
morn-ing.” 

Carl interrupted. “Cornut, be 
quiet. President, that was distress- 
ing, of course. I’ve had a full re- 
port on it and I believe we can 
pass it off as an accident. Perhaps 
it was an accident. I don’t know. It 
would have been quite easy to pick 
up the paper-knife in error.” 
Cornut said, “But—” 

“In an-y case, he must go.” 
“Naturally, President. You un- 
derstand that, don’t you, Cornut?” 
“But-” 

“You will take the ad-vance 
plane, please. I want you to be 
there when I ar-rive.” 

“But—” said Cornut, but he 
could not get a word deeper into 
that thought; through the mill of 

DRUNKARD’S WALK 



faculty came a man and a woman 
with the tense, nervous bearing of 
Townies. The woman carried a pho- 
totaper; the man was a reporter 
from one of the nets. 

“President St. Cyr? Thanks for 
inviting us. We’ll have a whole 
crew here when your expedition 
gets back, but I wonder if we can’t 
get a few photographs now. As I 
understand it, you’ve located seven 
aboriginals. I see. It’s a whole tribe, 
then, but seven are being brought 
back here. And who is the head of 
the expedition? Oh, naturally. 
Millie, will you be sure to get 
President St. Cyr?” 

The reporter’s thumb was on 
the trigger of his voicetaper, get- 
ting down the fact that nine fac- 
ulty members were going to bring 
back the seven aboriginals, that 
the expedition would leave, in two 
planes, at nine o’clock that night, 
so as to arrive at their destination 
in early morning, local time; and 
that the benefits to anthropologi- 
cal research would surely be be- 
yond calculation. 

Cornut drew Master Carl aside. 
“I don’t want to go! What the hell 
does this have to do with mathe- 
matics anyhow?” 

“Now, please, Cornut. You 
heard the President. It has nothing 
to do with mathematics, no, but 
it is purely a ceremonial function 
and a good deal of an honor. At the 
present time, you should not refuse 
it. You can see that some rumors 



31 




of your, uh, accidents have reached 
him. Don’t cause friction.” 

“What about the Wolgren? 
What about my, uh, accidents? 
Even here I nearly kill myself, and 
I’m all set up against it. What will 
I do without Egerd and my system 
of alarms?” 

“I’ll be with you.” 

“No, Carl!” 

Carl said, speaking very clearly, 
“You are going.” The eyes were 
star sapphires. 

Cornut studied the eyes for a 
moment, and then gave up. When 
Carl got that expression and that 
tone of voice, it meant that argu- 
ment served no further useful pur- 
pose. Since Cornut loved the old 
man, he always stopped arguing 
at that point. 

“I’m going,” he said. But the 
expression on his face would have 
soured wine. 

ORNUT packed — it took five 
'-' 4 minutes — and went back to 
the clinic to see if diagnostic space 
was free. It was not. He was cut- 
ting his time very close — takeoff 
for the first plane was in less than 
an hour — but mulishly he took a 
seat in the reception room and stol- 
idly he did not look at the clock. 

When the examination room was 
available, things went briskly. His 
vital statistics were machine- 
measured and machine-studied, his 
blood spectrum was machine-chro- 
matographed, automatically the 



examining table was tipped so that 
he could step off, and as he dressed, 
a photoelectric eye behind where 
garments had hung glanced at him, 
opened the door to the outside cor- 
ridor and said, “Thank you. Wait 
in the outer office, please,” from 
a machine-operated tape. 

Master Carl, in a fluster, found 
him waiting. 

“Good heavens, boy! Do you 
know the plane’s about to take off? 
And the president especially said 
we were to go in the first plane. 
Come on! I’ve a scooter waiting!” 
“Sorry.” 

“What the devil do you mean, 
sorry? Come on!” 

Cornut said flatly, “I agreed to 
go. I will go. But, as there is some 
feeling, shared by yourself, that 
the medics can help keep me from 
killing myself, I do not intend to 
leave this building until they tell 
me what I must do. I am waiting 
for the results of my examination 
now.” 

Master Carl said, “Oh.” He 
glanced at the clock on the wall. “I 
see.” He sat down beside Cornut 
thoughtfully, but then suddenly he 
grinned. “Quite right, boy. The 
president can’t argue with that.” 
Cornut relaxed. He said, “Well, 
you go ahead, Carl. No reason for 
both of us to get in trouble—” 
“Trouble?” Cornut realized it 
had finally occurred to the house 
master that this trip was a sort of 
vacation; he was practicing for a 



32 



GALAXY 




holiday mood. “Why should there 
be any trouble? You have a good 
reason for not being on time. I, too, 
have a good reason for waiting for 
you. After all, the president urged 
me to bring the Wolgren analysis 
along. He’s quite interested, you 
know. And I did not see it in your 
room, so I suppose it is in your 
bags. Therefore I will wait for your 
bags.” 

Cornut protested, “But it isn’t 
anywhere near finished!” 

Carl actually winked. “Now, do 
you suppose he’ll know the differ- 
ence? Be flattered that he is in- 
terested enough to pretend to look 
at it!” 

“Well, all right. But how the 
devil did he hear about it in the 
first place?” 

“I told him, of course. I — I’ve 
had occasion to discuss you with 
him a good deal, these past few 
days.” Carl’s expression lost some 
of its glow. “Cornut,” he said se- 
verely, “we can’t let this go on, 
can we? Your life must be regular- 
ized. Take a wife.” 

^MASTER CARL!” Cornut 
exploded. “You have no 
right to interfere in my personal 
affairs!” 

“And let you suicide?” the old 
man said. “This arrangement of 
alarms and Egerd is only a make- 
shift. A thirty-day marriage would 
surely see you through the worst 
of it, wouldn’t it?” 



Three weeks, thought Cornut— 
that’s how long I have — with luck. 

“And, truly, you need a wife. It 
is bad for a man to go through life 
alone.” 

Cornut snapped, “How about 
you?” 

“I’m old. You’re young. How 
long is it since you’ve had a wife?” 

Cornut was obstinately silent. 

“You see? There are many 
lovely young girls in the Univer- 
sity. They would be proud. Any of 
them.” 

Cornut did not want his mind to 
roam the corridors that had just 
been opened for it, but it did. 

“Besides, you will have her with 
you at all the dangerous times. You 
won’t need Egerd.” 

Cornut’s mind ran back quickly 
and began to trace a more familiar 
less attractive maze. “I’ll think 
about it,” he said at last, just as the 
medic came in with his report, a 
couple of boxes of pills and a sheaf 
of papers. The report was negative, 
all down the line. The pills? They 
were just in case — they couldn’t 
hurt; they might help. 

And the sheaf of papers . The 
top one said: Confidential. Tenta- 
tive. Studies of Suicidal Tenden- 
cies in Faculty Members. 

Cornut covered it with his hand, 
interrupted the medic, who was 
about to explain the delay in get- 
ting the dossiers for him, and cried, 
“Let’s get a move on, Carl! We can 
still make that plane.” 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



33 




As fast as the scooter would go, 
they got to the aircraft park — just 
in time to see the first section of 
the Field Expedition lift itself off 
the ground with a great whistling 
roar on its VTO jets. 

Much to Comut’s surprise, Mas- 
ter Carl was not upset. “Oh, well,” 
he said, “we had our reasons. It 
isn’t as though we were arbitrarily 
late. And anyway—” he allowed 
himself another wink, the second 
in a quarter of an hour— “this gives 
us a chance to ride in the presi- 
dent’s private plane, eh? Real liv- 
ing for us underprivileged 
Gownies!” He even opened his 
mouth to chuckle, but he didn’t do 
it, or if he did the sound was not 
heard. 

Overhead, there was a gruff 
giant’s cough and a bright spray of 
flame. They looked up. Flame, 
flame all over the heavens, falling 
in great white droplets to the Earth. 

“My God!” said Cornut softly. 
“That was our plane!” 

IV 

^lV'OTHING loath,” said 

-L ’ Master Carl thoughtfully, 
“I kissed your concubine.” He 
squinted out the window of the jet, 
savoring the sentence. It was good, 
yes, but was it perfect? 

A towering cumulonimbus, far 
below, caught his attention and 
distracted him. He sighed. He 
didn’t feel like working. Appar- 



ently everyone else in the jet was 
asleep. Or pretending to be. 

Only St. Cyr, way up front, 
propped on pneumatic pillows in 
the semicircular lounge, looked as 
much awake as he ever did. But it 
was better not to talk to St. Cyr. 
Carl was aware that most conver- 
sations involving himself turned, 
sooner or later, to either his private 
researches or to number theory. As 
he knew more about either than 
anyone else alive, they wound up 
as lectures. That was no good with 
St. Cyr. He had made it clear long 
ago that he was not interested in 
being instructed by the instructors 
he hired. 

Also he was in a bad mood. 

It was odd, thought Master Carl, 
less in resentment than in a spirit 
of scientific inquiry, but St. Cyr 
had been quite furious with Cornut 
and Carl for no good reason. It 
could not have been for missing 
the first plane. If they’d caught it, 
they would have died, just like its 
crew and the four graduate stu- 
dents it carried. But St. Cyr had 
been furious, the tick-tock voice 
hoarse and breathless, the hairless 
eyebrows almost scowling. 

Master Carl took his eyes away 
from the window and abandoned 
the question of St. Cyr. Let him 
sulk. Carl didn’t like problems that 
had no solution. Nothing loath, I 
kissed your concubine. But 
mightn’t it be better to write it as 
a song? 



34 



GALAXY 




He became conscious of a beery 
breath on the back of his neck. 

“I’m glad you’re awake, Wahl,” 
he said, turning, his face inches 
away from the hung-over face of 
the anthropologist. “Let me have 
your opinion, please. Which is eas- 
ier to remember: ‘Nothing loath, I 
kissed your concubine.’ Or: ‘Last 
digit? O, a potential square!’ ” 

Wahl shuddered. “A little pity, 
please. I just this minute woke 
up.” 

“Why, I don’t think that matters. 
It might help. The whole idea is 
to present the mnemonic in a form 
that is available under any condi- 
tions — including,” Master Carl 
said delicately, “a digestive upset.” 

He rotated his chair to face 
Wahl, flipping through his note- 
book to display a scribbled page. 
“Can you read that? The idea, you 
see, is to provide a handy recogni- 
tion feature for quick factoring of 
aliquot numbers. Now you know, 
of course, that all squares can end 
in only one of six digits. No square 
can end in two, three, seven or 
eight. So my first idea — I’m still 
not sure that I wasn’t on the right 
track — was to use, ‘No, quantity 
not squared.’ You see the utility, 
I’m sure. Two letters in the first 
word, ‘no.’ Eight letters in ‘quan- 
tity,’ three in ‘not’ and seven in 
‘squared.’ It’s easy to remember, I 
think, and it’s self-defining. I con- 
sider that a major advantage.” 

“Oh, it is,” groaned Wahl. 

DRUNKARD’S WALK 



Z"' 1 ARL went on, “But it’s nega- 
tive. Also there is the chance 
that ‘no’ can be misread for 
‘nought’ or ‘nothing’— meaning zero. 
So I tried the reverse approach. A 
square can end in zero, one, four, 
five, six or nine. Letting the ejacu- 
lative ‘O’ stand for ‘zero,’ I then 
wrote: ‘Last digit? O, a potential 
square.’ Four, five, zero, one, nine 
and six — you see? Excuse me. 
I’m so used to lecturing to under- 
graduates that sometimes I tend 
to overexplain. But, although that 
has a lot to recommend it, it doesn’t 
have — well — yumph.” He smiled 
with a touch of embarrassment. 
“So, just on an inspiration, I came 
up with ‘Nothing loath, I kissed 
your concubine.’ Rather catchy, 
no?” 

“It’s all of that, Carl,” agreed 
Wahl, rubbing his temples. “Say, 
where’s Cornut?” 

“You realize that the ‘nothing’ 
again is ‘zero.’ ” 

“Oh, there he is. Hey, Cornut!” 

“Let the boy sleep!” Carl 
snapped, jolted out of his concen- 
tration. He leaned forward to look 
into the wing-backed seat ahead of 
him and was gratified to find that 
Cornut was still snoring faintly. 

Wahl burst into a laugh, stopped 
abruptly and clutched his head. 
After a moment he said, “You take 
care of him like he was your baby.” 

“There is no need to take that 
sort of tone.” 

“I’ve heard of accident-prones, 

35 




but this one’s fantastic. Wrecks 
planes that he ought to be in but 
isn’t!” 

Master Carl bit back his rejoin- 
der, paused to regain his temper 
and pondered an appropriate re- 
mark. He was saved the trouble. 
The jet lurched slightly and the 
distant thunderheads began to 
wheel toward the horizon. It 
wasn’t the clouds; it was the jet 
swinging in for a landing vectored 
by unseen radar. Only a very small 
motion, but it sent Wahl lurching 
frantically to the washroom and it 
woke Master Cornut. 

Carl leaped up as soon as he 
saw the younger man move, stood 
over him until his eyes were open. 
“Are you all right?” 

Cornut blinked, yawned and 
stretched his muscles. “I guess so. 
Yes.” 

‘We’re about to land.” There 
was relief in Carl’s voice. He had 
not expected anything to happen. 
Why should it? But there had 
been the chance that something 
might. “I can get you a cup of cof- 
fee from the galley.” 

“Yes, I’d like — no, never mind. 
We’ll be down in a minute.” 

Below them, the island was slip- 
ping back and forth slantwise, like 
a falling leaf — a leaf that was fall- 
ing upward, at least to them, be- 
cause it was growing enormously 
fast. 

Wahl came out of the washroom 
and stared at the houses. 

36 



“Dirty hovels,” he growled. 

It was raining beneath them — 
no, around them — no, over. They 
were through the patchy cloud 
layer, and the “hovels” Wahl had 
glimpsed were clear beneath. Out 
of the patches of clouds, rain was 
falling. 

“Cum-u-lus of or-o-graph-ic or- 
i-gin,” said St. Cyr’s uninflected 
voice, next to Master Carl’s ear. 
“There is al-ways cloud at the 
island. I hope the storm does not 
dis-turb you.” 

Master Wahl said, “It disturbs 
me” 

r T' HEY landed, the jet’s wheels 
screaming thinly as they 
touched the wet concrete runway. 
A short, dark man with an umbrella 
ran out and, holding it protectively 
over St. Cyr’s head, escorted them 
to the administration building, 
though the rain had nearly stopped. 

It was evident that St. Cyr’s 
reputation and standing were 
working for them. The whole party 
was passed through customs under 
seal; the brown-skinned inspec- 
tors didn’t even touch the bags. 
One of them prowled around the 
stack of the Field Expedition’s 
luggage, carrying a portable voice- 
typer. “Research instruments,” he 
chanted, singsong, and the ma- 
chine clacked out its entry. “Re- 
search instruments . Research 
instruments.” 

Master Carl interrupted. “That’s 
GALAXY 




my personal bag! There aren’t any 
research instruments in it.” 

“Excuse,” said the inspector po- 
litely, but he went right on calling 
every bag “research instruments.” 
The only concession he made to 
Carl’s correction was to lower his 
voice. 

It was, to Master Carl, an offen- 
sive performance, and he had it in 
his mind to speak to someone in 
authority about it, too. Research 
instruments! They had nothing re- 
sembling a research instrument to 
their names, unless you counted 
the collection of handcuffs Master 
Wahl had brought along, just in 
case the aboriginals were obstinate 
about coming along. He thought of 
bringing it up with St. Cyr, but the 
president was talking to Cornut. 
Carl didn’t want to cut in. He had 
no objection to interrupting Cor- 
nut, but interrupting the president 
of the university was something 
else again. 

Wahl said, “What’s that over 
there? Looks like a bar, doesn’t it? 
How about a drink?” 

Carl shook his head frostily and 
stomped out into the street. He 
was not enjoying his trip, and it 
was a pity, he thought, because he 
realized that he had been rather 
looking forward to it. One needed 
a change of scene from the Halls 
of Academe every once in a while. 
Otherwise one tended to become 
stuffy and provincial, to lose con- 
tact with the mass of humanity out- 

DRUNKARD'S WALK 



side the university walls. For that 
reason, Carl had made it a practice, 
through all the decades since he 
began to teach, at least once in 
every year to accept or invent 
some task that would bring him in 
contact with the non-academic 
world . They had all been quite 
as distasteful as this one, but since 
Master Carl had never realized 
this, it didn’t matter. 

He stood in a doorway, out of 
the fresh hot sun, looking down a 
broad street. The “filthy hovels” 
were not filthy at all; it was only 
Wahl’s bad temper that had said 
that, not his reason. Why, they 
were quite clean, Master Carl mar- 
veled. Not attractive. And not 
large. But they did have a quaint 
and not too repulsive appearance. 
They were clumsy prefabs of some 
sort of pressed fiber, plastic- 
bonded — a local product, most 
likely, Master Carl diagnosed; 
pulp from palm trees had gone into 
the making of them. 

A roadable helipopper whirred, 
dipped, settled in the street before 
him, folded its vanes and rolled up 
to the entrance of the building 
where Carl was standing. The 
driver jumped out, ran around the 
side of the craft and opened the 
door. 

N OW, that was odd. The driver 
acted as though the Empress 
Catherine were about to set foot 
on the soil she ruled, and yet what

The helipopper was already on looking back toward the native

Cornut?” No one was listening. He had promised the boy . 






He felt very guilty indeed. But 
of course, he told himself, there 
was no danger. There were no hos- 
tile natives anywhere in the world. 
Lightning would not strike. Cornut 
was as safe as if he were in his own 
bed. 

Exactly as safe, Carl’s own mind 
assured him sternly. And no safer. 

"D UT the fact of the matter was 
that Cornut was drinking a 
glass of beer at a dusty sidewalk 
table. For the first time in — was it 
forever? — his mind was at rest. 

He was not thinking of the anom- 
alies a statistical census had dis- 
covered in Wolgren’s Distributive 
Law. He was not thinking of Mas- 
ter Carl’s suggestion about term 
marriage, or even about the annoy- 
ing interruption that this expedition 
represented. It did not seem quite 
as much of an annoyance, now that 
he was here. It was so quiet. He 
tested it experimentally with his 
ears and decided that, though odd, 
it was pleasant. A few hundred 
yards away some aircraft chugged 
into the sky, destroying the quiet, 
but the odd thing was that the 
quiet returned. 

Cornut now had the chance he 
had been looking for since leaving 
the clinic, the night before and 
ten thousand miles away. He or- 
dered another beer from the sal- 
low waitress and reached into his 
pocket for the sheaf of reports that 
the medic had handed him. 



There were more of them than 
he had expected. 

How many cases had the analyst 
said had occurred at their own 
University? Fifteen or so. But here 
were more than a hundred case 
histories. 

Cornut scanned the summaries 
quickly and discovered that the 
problem extended beyond the Uni- 
versity — cases from other schools, 
cases from outside University cir- 
cles entirely. There seemed to have 
been a rash of them among Gov- 
ernment employees. There was a 
concentration of twelve on the staff 
of a single television network. 

He read the meaningless names 
and studied the almost as mean- 
ingless facts. One of the TV men 
had succeeded in short-circuiting 
a supposedly foolproof electric 
mattress eight times before he 
managed to die of it. He was hap- 
pily married and about to be pro- 
moted. 

“Ancora birra ?*’ Cornut jumped, 
but it was only the waiter. 

“No, thanks — no, wait.” There 
was no sense in these continual 
interruptions. “Bring me a couple 
of bottles and leave them.” 

The sun was setting, the clouds 
overhead powerless to shield the 
island from its heat, for the horizon 
was bare blue. It was hot and the 
beer was making him sleepy. 

It occurred to him that he really 
ought to be making an effort to 
catch up with the rest of the party. 



40 



GALAXY 




It was only chance that they had 
gone off without him; probably 
Master Carl would be furious. 

It also occurred to him that it 
was comfortable here. 

On an island as small as this, he 
would have no trouble finding 
them when he wanted them. Mean- 
while he still had some beer, and 
he had all these reports, and it did 
not seem particularly disturbing to 
him that, though he read them all 
from beginning to end, he still 
found none where the course of 
the syndrome had taken more than 
ten weeks to reach its climax. Ten 
weeks. 

He had twenty days left. 

1%/TASTER Carl demanded: 
1* J. “Turn back! You can’t leave 
the poor boy to die!” 

St. Cyr whinnied surprisingly. 
The woman shrrilled: “He’ll be all 
right. What’s the matter, you want 
to spoil his fun? Give the kid a 
chance to kill himself, will you?” 

Carl took a deep breath. Then 
he started again, but it was no 
use; they insisted on treating the 
matter lightly. He slumped back 
in his seat and stared out the 
window. 

The helipopper came down in 
front of a building larger than most 
of the prefabs. It had glass in the 
windows, and bars over the glass. 
Madame Sant’ Anna leaped up 
like a stick doll and shrilled, 
“Everybody out! Hop to it, now! 



I haven’t got all day, you know!” 

Carl morosely followed her into 
the building. He wondered how, 
even for a moment and at a dis- 
tance, he had taken her for a child. 
Bright blue eyes under blonde hair, 
yes; but the eyes were bloodshot, 
the hair a yellow mop draped on a 
skull. Loathing her, and worrying 
about Cornut, he climbed a flight 
of steps, went through a barred 
door and looked into a double- 
barred room. 

“The ab-o-rig-i-nes,” St. Cyr 
said in his toneless voice. 

It was the local jail, and it had 
only one cell, and that cell was 
packed with a dozen or more 
short, olive-skinned, ragged men 
and women. There were no chil- 
dren. No children, thought Master 
Carl petulantly, but they had 
promised an entire population to 
select from! These were all old. 
The youngest of them seemed at 
least a hundred. 

“Observe them care-ful-ly,” 
came St. Cyr’s slow voice. “There 
is not a per-son there more than 
fif-ty years old.” 

Master Carl jumped. Mind- 
reading again! He thought with a 
touch of envy how wonderful it 
must be to be so wise, so experi- 
enced, so all-understanding that 
one could know, as St. Cyr knew, 
what another person was thinking 
before he spoke it aloud. It was the 
sort of wisdom he hoped his. sub- 
ordinates would attribute to him; 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



41 




and they didn’t; and it hurt to see 
that in St. Cyr it existed. 

Master Carl moved fretfully 
down the corridor, looking through 
the electrified bars at the aborig- 
ines. A sallow fat man in flowered 
shorts came in through the door, 
bowed to the blonde woman, 
bowed to St. Cyr, stared contemp- 
tuously through the others, and 
offered a slight inclination of the 
head to Master Carl. It was an 
instructive demonstration of how 
a really adept person could single 
out the categories of importance 
of a group of strangers on first con- 
tact. 

“I,” he announced, “am your 
translator. You wish to speak to 
your aboriginals, sir. Do so. The 
short one there, he speaks some 
English.” 

“Thank you,” said Master Carl. 

The short one was a surly look- 
ing fellow wearing much the same 
costume as the others. All of them 
were basically clad in ragged shorts 
and a short-sleeved jacket with an 
incongruous, tight-fitting collar. 
The clothes looked very, very old; 
not merely worn, but old. Men and 
women dressed alike. Only in the 
collars and shoulder-bars of the 
jackets were there any particular 
variations. 

They seemed to have military 
insigne to mark their ranks. The 
woman’s collar, for example, bore 
a red cloth patch with a gold stripe 
running through it; the red was 



faded, the gold was soiled, but 
once they had been bright. Across 
the gold stripe was a five-pointed 
star of yellow cloth. The shortest 
of the men, the one who looked up 
when the translator spoke, had a 
red patch with much more gold on 
it, and with three stars of greenish, 
tarnished metal. Another man had 
a plain red patch with three cloth 
stars. 

HP HESE three, the two men and 
the women, stepped forward, 
placed their palms on their knees 
and bowed jerkily. The one with 
the metal stars spoke breathily: 
“Tai-i Masatura-san. I captain, sir. 
These are of my command: 
Heicho Ikuri, Joto-hei Shokuto.” 

Master Carl stepped back fa- 
stidiously. They smelled! They 
didn’t look dirty, exactly, but their 
complexions were all bad — 
scarred and pitted and seamed, as 
well as sallow; and they did have 
a distinct sour aura of sweat hang- 
ing over them. 

He glanced at the interpreter. 
“Captain? Is that an army rank?” 

The interpreter grinned. “No 
army now,” he said reassuringly. 
“Oh, no. Long gone. But they keep 
military titles, you see? Father to 
son, father to son, like that. This 
fellow here, the tai-i, he tells me 
they are all part of Imperial Japa- 
nese Expeditionary Force which 
presently will make assault land- 
ing in Washington, D.C. Tai-i is

GALAXY 




captain; he is in charge of all of 
them, I believe. The heicho — 
that’s the woman — is, the captain 
tells, a sort of junior corporal. 
More important than the other 
fellow, who is what they say a 
superior private.” 

“I don’t know what a corporal 
or a private is.” 

“Who does? But to them it is 
important, it seems.” The transla- 
tor hesitated, grinned, and 
wheezed: “Also, they are related. 
The tai-i- is daddy, the heicho is 
mommy, the joto-hei is son. All 
named Masatura-san.” 

“Dirty looking things,” Master 
Carl commented. “Thank heaven 
I don’t have to go near them.” 
“Oh,” said a grave, slow voice 
behind him, “but you do. Yes, you 
do. It is your re-spon-si-bi-li-ty, 
Carl. You must su-per-vise their 
tests by the med-ics.” 

1%/|" ASTER Carl frowned and 
-L” complained, but there was no 
way out of it. St. Cyr gave the 
orders, and that was the order he 
gave. 

The medics looked over the 
aboriginals as thoroughly as any 
dissecting cadavers. Medics, 
thought Master Carl in disgust. 
How can they! But they did. 

They had the men and women 
strip — flaccid breasts, sagging 
bellies, a terminator of deepening 
olive showing the transition from 
shade to sun at the lines marked 



by collars and cuffs and the hems 
of their shorts. Carl took as much 
of it as he could, and then he 
walked out— leaving them nakedly 
proud beside their rags, while the 
medics fussed and muttered over 
them like livestock judges handing 
out ribbons. 

It was not only that he was tired 
of the natives — whose interest to 
a mathematician was not zero, no, 
but a quantity vanishingly small. 
More than that, he wanted to find 
Cornut. 

T N the light of a huge moon, Carl 
-*■ retraced his steps to where the 
helipopper was casting a black 
silhouette on the silver dust. The 
pilot was half asleep on the seat, 
and Carl, with a force and deter- 
mination previously reserved for 
critical letters in Math. Trans., 
said sharply: “Up, you! I haven’t 
all night!” 

The startled pilot was airborne 
with his passenger before he real- 
ized that it was neither his em- 
ployer, the young-old blonde, nor 
the old, old St. Cyr. 

By then it did not much matter. 
In for a penny, in for a pound; 
when Carl ordered him back to 
the town where the jet had landed, 
the pilot grumbled to himself but 
complied. 

It was not hard to find where 
Cornut had gone. The scooter 
police told Carl about the side- 
walk cafe, the cashier told him 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



43 




about the native cafeteria, the 
counterman had watched Cornut, 
failing to finish his sandwich and 
coffee, stagger back to — the air- 
port again. There the traffic tower 
had seen him come in, try to get 
transportation to follow the others, 
fail, and stagger off into the jungle 
on the level truck road. 

He had been hardly able to 
keep his eyes open, the towerman 
added. 

Carl pressed the police into 
service. He was frightened. 

The little scooter bounced along 
the road, twin spotlights scanning 
the growth on both sides. Please 
find him, begged Carl silently. I 
promised him . 

The brakes squealed and the 
scooter skidded to a halt. 

The police were small, thin, 
young and agile, but Master Carl 
was first off the scooter and first to 
the side of the huddled figure under 
the breadfruit tree. 

For the first time in weeks, Cor- 
nut had fallen asleep — passed out, 
in fact — without a guardian angel. 
The moment of helplessness be- 
tween walking and sleeping, the 
moment that had almost killed him 
a dozen times, had caught him by 
the side of a deserted road, in the 
middle of an uninhabited sink of 
smelly soft vegetation. 

Carl gently lifted the limp head. 

“My God,” he said, a prayer in- 
stead of an oath, “he’s only drunk. 
Help me get him to bed.” 



ORNUT woke up with a sick 
^ mouth and a banging head. 
Master Carl was seated at a field 
desk, a shaded light over his head. 
“Oh, you’re up. Good. I had the 
porter call me a few minutes 
early, in case—” 

“Yes. I know.” Cornut waggled 
his jaw experimentally, but that 
was not a pleasant experiment. 
Still, he felt very good. He had not 
been drunk in a long, long time, 
and a hangover was strange enough 
to him to be interesting in itself. 

He sat on the side of the bed. 
The porter had evidently had 
other orders from Master Carl, 
because there was coffee in a pew- 
ter pot, and a thick pottery cup. 
Cornut drank some. 

Carl watched him for a while, 
then browsed back to his desk. He 
had a jar of some faintly greenish 
liquid and the usual stack of photo- 
graphic prints. “How about this 
one?” he asked. “Does it look like 
a star to you?” 

“No.” 

Carl dropped it back on the 
heap. “Becquerel’s was no better.” 
“I’m sorry, Carl,” Cornut said 
cheerfully. “You know I don’t take 
much interest in psion—” 

“Cornut!” 

“Sorry. In your researches into 
paranormal kinetics, then.” 

Carl said doubtfully, having al- 
ready forgotten what Cornut had 
said, “I thought Greenlease had 
put me on the track of something. 



44 



GALAXY 




You know I’ve been trying to ma- 
nipulate single molecules by P. K. 
— using photographic film — on the 
principle that as the molecules are 
just about to flip over into another 
state, not much energy should be 
needed to trigger them. Well, 
Greenlease told me about Brown- 
ian movement. Like this.” He held 
the jar of soap solution to the 
light. “See?” 

Comut got up and took the 
quart jar from Master Carl’s hand. 
In the light, he could see that the 
greenish color was the sum of 
myriad wandering points of light, 
looking more gold than green. 
“Brownian movement? What 
about it?” 

“The actual motion of mole- 
cules,” Carl said solemnly. “One 
molecule impinging on another, 
knocking it into a third, the third 
knocking it into a fourth. There’s 
a term for it in—” 

“In math, of course. Why, cer- 
tainly. Drunkard’s Walk.” Cornut 
remembered the concept with clar- 
ity and affection. He had been a 
second-year student, and the 
House Master was old Wayne; the 
audiovisual had been a marionette 
drunkard, lurching away from a 
doll-sized lamp post with random 
drunken steps in random drunken 
directions. Cornut smiled at the jar. 

“Well, what I want to do is sober 
him up. Watch.” Carl puffed and 
thought; he was a model of concen- 
tration; Rodin had only sketched 

DRUNKARD’S WALK 



the rough outlines, compared to 
Master Carl. Then he panted. 
“Well?” 

Apparently, Cornut thought, 
what Carl had been trying to 
do was to make a molecule move 
in a straight line. “I don’t think I 
see a thing,” he admitted. 

“No. Neither do I . Well,” said 
Master Carl, retrieving his jar, 
“even a negative answer is an 
answer. But I haven’t given up yet. 
I have a few more thoughts on 
photographs — if Greenlease can 
give me a little help.” He sat down 
next to Cornut. “And you?” 

“You saw.” 

Carl nodded seriously. “I saw 
that you were still alive. Was it 
because you were on your own 
Drunkard’s Walk?” 

Cornut shook his head. He didn’t 
mean no. He meant, “How can I 
tell?” 

“And my idea about finding a 
wife?” asked Carl. 

“I don’t know.” 

“That girl in the dining hall,” 
Carl said with some acuteness. 
“How about her?” 

“Locille? Oh, good Lord, Carl, 
how do I know about her? I — I 
just barely know her name. Any- 
way, she seems to be pretty close 
to Egerd.” 

Carl got up and wandered to the 
window. “Might as well have 
breakfast. The aboriginals ought to 
be ready now.” He stared at the 
crimson morning. “Madame Sanf- 

45 




Anna has asked for a helper to get 
the aboriginals to Valparaiso,” he 
said thoughtfully. “I think I’ll help 
her out.” 

V 

' I ' EN thousand miles away, in 
the early afternoon, Locille was 
not very close to Egerd at all. 

“Sorry,” she said. “I would like 
to. But— ’ 

Egerd stood up. 

“What’s the record for suicid- 
ers?” he said angrily. “Ten weeks? 
Good enough. I’ll be around to see 
you again — along about the first 
of the month.” 

He stalked out of the girls’ day- 
room. 

Locille sighed, but as she did 
not know what to do about Egerd’s 
jealousy, she did nothing. It was 
difficult to be a girl sometimes. 

For here’s Locille, a girl, a pretty 
girl, full of a girl’s problems. It is a 
girl’s business to keep her prob- 
lems to herself. It is a girl’s busi- 
ness to looked poised and lovely. 
And available. 

It is not true that girls are made 
of sugar and spice. These mysteri- 
ous creatures, enameled of com- 
plexion, scented with distant flower 
fields and musk, constricted here 
and enlarged there — they are ani- 
mals, as men are animals, sustained 
by the same sludgy trickle of partly 
fermented organic matter — and 
indeed with a host of earthy prob- 



lems men need never know. 

Womanhood has always been a 
triumph of artifice over the animal 
within. 

And here, as we say, is Locille, 
twenty years old, student child of 
a retired subway enginer and his 
retired social-worker wife. 

She is young. 

She is nubile. 

She has the health of a plow- 
mare. 

What can she know of myster- 
ies? 

But she knew. 

the night the Field Expedi- 
^-^tion was due to return, Locille 
was excused all of her evening 
classes. She took advantage of an 
hour of freedom to telephone her 
parents, out on the texas. She dis- 
covered, as she had discovered a 
hundred times before, that there 
was nothing to say between them; 
and returned to the kitchens of the 
Faculty Mess in time to take up 
her duties for the evening. 

The occasion was the return of 
the Field Expedition. It promised 
to be a monstrous feast. 

More than two hundred visiting 
notables would be present, as well 
as most of the upper faculty of the 
University itself. The kitchens 
were buzzing with activity. All six 
C.E.s were on duty, all busy. 

The Culinary Engineer in 
charge of Sauces and Gravies spied 
Locille first and drafted her to 



46 



GALAXY 




help him, but there was a struggle; 
the Engineer whose charge was 
Pastries knew her and wanted her 
too. Sauces and Gravies won out, 
and Locille found herself emulsi- 
fying caked steer blood and pow- 
dered spices in a huge metal vat. 
The sonic whine of the emulsifier 
and the staccato hiss of the steam 
as she valved it expertly into the 
mixture drowned out the roar of 
the settling jet — the Field Expedi- 
tion had returned without her 
knowing it. 

The first clue she had was when 
there was a commotion at one end 
of the kitchens, and she turned, 
and there was Egerd, shepherding 
three short, sallow persons she 
didn’t recognize. 

He saw her. “Locille! Come on 
over and meet the aboriginals!” 

She hesitated and glanced at her 
C.E., who pantomimed take-ten-if- 
it-won’t-spoil-the-gravy. Locille 
slipped off her gauntlets, set the 
automatic timers and thermostats 
and ducked past the kneading, bak- 
ing, pressure-cooking machines of 
the Faculty Kitchen toward Egerd 
and his trophies. 

“They’re Japanese,” he said 
proudly. “You’ve heard of World 
War Two? They were abandoned 
on an island, and their descend- 
ants have been there ever since. 
Say, Locille—” 

She took her eyes off the aborig- 
inals to look at Egerd. He seemed 
both angry and proud. 



“I have to go to Valparaiso,” he 
said. “There are six other aborigi- 
nals who are going to South Amer- 
ica, and Master Carl picked me to 
go along.” 

She started to answer, but the 
young instructor, Master Cornut, 
was wandering into the room, look- 
ing thoughtful. 

Egerd looked thoughtfully back 
at him. 

“I wondered why Carl picked 
me for this,” he said, not bitterly, 
but with comprehension. “Good 
enough.” He turned to leave 
through another door. “He can 
have his chance — for the next 
sixteen days.” 

T HOUGHTFUL Cornut looked, 
and thoughtful he was. He had 
never proposed marriage before. 

“Hello, Locille,” he said for- 
mally. 

She said, “Hello, Master Cor- 
nut.” 

He said, “I, uh, want to ask you 
something.” 

She said nothing. 

He looked around the kitchen 
as though he had never been in 
it before, which was probably so. 
He said, ‘Would you like to — ah — 
would you like to meet me on 
Overlook Tower tomorrow?” 

“Certainly, Master Cornut.” 

“That’s fine,” he said politely, 
nodding, and was halfway into the 
dining room before he realized he 
hadn’t told her what time. Maybe 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



47 




she thought he expected her to 
stand there all day long! 

He hurried back. “At noon?” 

“Yes, Master Cornut.” 

“And don’t make any plans for 
the evening,” he commanded, hur- 
rying away. It was embarrassing. 
He had never proposed marriage 
before, and had not succeeded in 
proposing now. 

But he was wrong. He had. He 
didn’t know it, but Locille did. 

The rest of the evening passed 
very rapidly for Cornut. The din- 
ner was a great success. The 
aborigines were a howl. They 
passed among the guests, smoking 
their pipe of peace with anyone 
who cared to try it, which was 
everyone, and as the guests got 
drunker, the aborigines, respond- 
ing to every toast with a loud Ban- 
zai!, then a hoarse one, then a 
simper — the aborigines got 
drunker still. 

Cornut caught glimpses of Lo- 
cille from time to time at first, then 
not at all. He asked after her, 
asked the waitress, asked the abo- 
rigines, finally found himself ask- 
ing — or telling — about Locille 
with his arm around the flaccid 
shoulders of Master Wahl. He was 
quite drunk early, and he kept on 
drinking. He had moments of clar- 
ity. Master Carl listening patiently 
while Cornut tried to demonstrate 
Brownian motion — the Drunk- 
ard’s Walk of molecules — in, ap- 
propriately, a rye-and-ginger-ale; 



a queer, alone moment when he 
realized he was staggering around 
the empty kitchen, calling Locille’s 
name to the cold copper caldrons. 

Somehow, God knows how, he 
found himself in the elevators of 
Math Tower, when it must have 
been very late, and Egerd in a 
cream-colored robe was trying to 
help him into his room. He knew 
he said something to Egerd that 
must have been either coarse or 
cruel, because the boy turned away 
from him and did not protest when 
Cornut locked his door, but he did 
not know what coarse or cruel 
thing he had said. Had he men- 
tioned Locille? When had he not! 

He fell sprawled on his bed, 
giggling. He had mentioned Locille 
a thousand times that night, and he 
stroked the pillow beside him as 
he drifted off to sleep. 

1TE drifted off to sleep and 
halted, for a moment sober, 
for a moment terrified, knowing 
that he was on the verge of sleep, 
again alone. But he could not stop. 

He could not stop because he 
was a molecule in a sea of soapy 
soup and Master Carl was hurling 
him into the arms of Locille. 

Master Carl was hurling him at 
Locille because Egerd had hurled 
him at Master Carl; Locille thrust 
him at St. Cyr, and St. Cyr, voice- 
lessly chuckling, hurled him clear 
out of the jar, and he could not 
stop. 



48 



GALAXY 




He could not stop because St. 
Cyr told him: “You are a mole- 
cule, drunken molecule. You are 
a molecule, drunk and random, 
without path. You are a drunken 
molecule and you cannot stop.” 
He could not stop though the 
greatest voice in the world was 
shouting at him: “YOU CAN 
ONLY DIE, DRUNKEN MOL- 
ECULE! YOU CAN DIE - YOU 
CANNOT STOP!” 

He could not stop because the 
world was reeling, reeling. He 
tried to open his eyes to halt it, 
but it would not stop. 

He was a molecule. 

He saw that he was a molecule 
and he saw he could not stop. 
Then — 
the molecule 
— stopped. 

VI 

"C' GERD tried pounding on the 
locked door for nearly five 
minutes and then went away. He 
could have stayed longer, but he 
didn’t want to. He thought it out 
carefully and concluded, first, that 
he had done what he undertook to 
do — in spite of the fact that Cor- 
nut’s choosing to marry Locille 
upset the undertaking — and sec- 
ond, that if he was too late, he 
was already too late. 

An hour later, Cornut woke up. 
He was alive, he noticed im- 
mediately. 



It had been a most peculiar 
dream. It did not seem like a 
dream. His afternoon lecture, with 
Pogo Possum drawling hickory- 
bark rules for factoring large in- 
tegers, was much more fantasy in 
his mind than the dream-scene of 
himself contemplating himself, 
staggering drunk and with a bottle 
in his hand, trapped in the cease- 
less Brownian zigzag. He knew 
that the only way a molecule 
could stop was to die, but curiously 
he had not died. 

He got up, dressed and went out. 

He was remarkably hung over, 
but it was much, much better out- 
side. It was bright morning and, he 
remembered very clearly, he had 
an engagement with Locille at 
noon. 

He was on tape for the A.M. 
lecture; it gave him the morning 
off. He walked about the campus 
aimlessly, past the green steel and 
glass of the stadium, past the broad 
lawns of the lower campus to the 
bridge. The Med School lay hud- 
dled under the bridge itself. He 
liked the bridge, liked its sweep 
across the Bay, liked the way it 
condescended to drop one pylon 
to the island where the University 
had been built. He very much liked 
that pylon. That was Overlook 
Tower. 

On impulse, thinking that this 
was a good time to be wholly sober, 
he stopped at the clinic to get a 
refill on his wake-up pills. The clinic 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



49 




was not manned at that hour, ex- 
cept for emergencies, but because 
Cornut was a returnee, he was ad- 
mitted to the automatic diagnosis 
machines. 

It was very much the same as 
the experience before the Field Ex- 
pedition, except that there was no 
human doctor at all. A mechanical 
finger inserted a hair-thin tendril 
into his arm and tasted his blood, 
compared it with the recent chro- 
matograph, and whirred thought- 
fully while it considered if there 
had been changes. In a moment the 
Solution light winked pink, there 
was a click and clatter, and in a 
hopper by his hand there dropped 
a plastic box of his pills. 

He took one. Ah, fine! It was a 
strange and rewarding sensation. 
Whatever the pills contained, they 
fought fatigue at first encounter. 
He could trace the course of that 
pill clear down his throat and into 
his abdomen. The path tingled with 
well-being. He felt pretty good. No, 
he felt very good. 

He walked out into the fresh air 
again, humming to himself. 

It was a long climb up the pylon 
to Overlook Landing, but he did 
it on foot, feeling comfortable all 
the way. He popped another pill 
into his mouth and waited in pa- 
tient good humor for Locille. 

CHE came promptly from her 
k -' class. From the base of the 
pylon, she glanced up at the Over- 

50 



look Landing, nearly two hundred 
feet over her head. If Cornut was 
there, she couldn’t see him. She 
rode up on the outside escalators, 
twining round the huge hexagonal 
tower, for the sake of the air and 
the view. 

It was a lovely view — the clean 
white rectahedron of the Biologi- 
cals factory, the dome-shaped Clinic 
under the spreading feet of the 
pylon itself, the bright University 
buildings, the green of the lawns, 
the two dissimilar blues of water 
and sky. 

Lovely . 

But she was nervous. 

She stepped off the escalator, 
turned around the bulk of the pylon 
and bowed. “Master Cornut,” she 
said. 

The wind caught at her blouse 
and hair. Cornut stood dreaming 
over the rail, his own hair blown 
carelessly around his forehead. He 
turned idly and smiled with sleepy 
eyes. 

“Ah,” he said. “Locille.” He 
nodded as though she had answered 

— she had not. “Locille, I need a 
wife. You will do.” 

“Thank you, Master Cornut.” 

He waved a gentle hand. “You 
aren’t engaged, I understand?” 

“No.” Unless you counted Egerd 

— but she didn’t count Egerd. 

“Nor pregnant, I presume?” 

“No. I have never been preg- 
nant.” 

“Oh, no matter, no matter,” he 
GALAXY 




said. “I don’t mind that. No sort 
of physical problem, I suppose?” 
“No.” She didn’t meet his eye 
that time, though. For there was a 
sort of physical problem, in a way. 
There couldn’t have been a preg- 
nancy without a man, and she had 
avoided that. 

She stood waiting for him to say 
something else, but he was a long 
time in getting around to it. Out 
of the corner of her eye, she noted 
that he was taking pills out of that 
little box as though they were 
candy. She wondered if he knew he 
was taking them. 

She remembered the knife-edge 
at his throat in class. She remem- 
bered the stories Egerd had told. 
Silly business. 

Why would anyone try to kill 
himself? 

¥T E collected himself and cleared 
his throat, taking another pill. 
“Let me see,” he mused. “No en- 
gagements of record, no physical 
bars, no consanguinity, of course 
— I’m an only child, you see. Well, 
I think that’s everything, Locille. 
Shall we say tonight, after late 
class?” He looked suddenly con- 
cerned. “That is — you have no ob- 
jection, do you?” 

“I have no objection.” 

“Good.” He nodded, but his face 
remained clouded. “Locille,” he 
began," perhaps you’ve heard stories 
about me. I — I have had a number 
of accidents lately. And one rea- 



son why I wish to take a wife is 
to guard against any more acci- 
dents. Do you understand?” 

“I understand that, Master Cor- 
nut.” 

“Very good. Very good.” He took 
another pill out of the box, hesi- 
tated, glanced at it. 

His eyes widened. 

Locille stood motionless; she 
didn’t know that a sudden realiza- 
tion had come to Master Cornut. 

It was the last pill in the box. 
But there had been twenty — at 
least twenty — not more than three- 
quarters of an hour before — 
twenty! 

He cried hoarsely: “Another ac- 
cident!” 

It was as if the realization re- 
leased the storm of the pills. Cor- 
nut’s pulse began to pound. His 
head throbbed in a new and faster 
tempo. The world spun scarlet 
around him. A rush of bile clogged 
his throat. 

“Master Cornut!” 

But it was already too late for 
the girl to cry out. He knew; he 
had acted. He hurled the box out 
into space, stared at her, crimson, 
then without ceremony leaped to 
the rail. 

Locille screamed. 

She was after him, clutching at 
him, but impatiently he shrugged 
her off, and then she saw that he 
was not climbing to hurl himself 
to death. He had his finger down 
his throat. Without romance or 



DRUNKARD’S WALK 



51 




manners, Master Cornut was get- 
ting the poison out of him quickly, 
efficiently — 

Locille stood by silently, wait- 
ing. 

After a few minutes his shoulders 
stopped heaving, but he leaned on 
the rail, staring, for minutes after 
that. When he turned, his face was 
the racked face of a damned soul. 

“I’m sorry. Thanks.” 

Locille said softly, “But I didn’t 
do anything.” 

“Of course you did. You woke 
me up — ” 

She shook her head. “You did it 
by yourself, you know. You did.” 

He looked at her with irritation, 
then with doubt. And then, at last, 
he looked at her with the beginning 
of hope. 

VII 

Hr HE ceremony was very simple. 

Master Carl officiated. There 
was a friendly meal, and then they 
were left alone, Locille and Cornut, 
by the grace of the magisterial 
power vested in house masters man 
and wife. 

They went to his room. 

“You’d better rest,” said Locille. 

“Right.” He sprawled on the bed. 
He was very much aware of her, 
now studying, now doing woman- 
like tasks around his room — no, 
their room. She was as inconspicu- 
ous as a flesh-and-blood person 
could be, moving quickly when die 



moved. But she might have been 
neon-lit and blaring with sirens for 
the way she kept distracting him. 

He stood up and dressed himself, 
not looking at her. She said ques- 
tioningly, “It’s time for sleep, isn’t 
it?” 

He fumbled. “Is it?” But the 
clock said yes, it was: he had slept 
the day through. “Right,” he said, as 
though it were some trivial thing 
and not world-shaking at all. “Yes, 
it’s time for — sleep. But I think I 
will take a walk around the cam- 
pus, Locille. I need it.” 

“Certainly.” She waited, polite 
and calm. 

“Perhaps I shall be back before 
you are asleep,” he went on. “Per- 
haps not. Perhaps — ” He was 
rambling. He nodded, cleared his 
throat, picked up his cloak and left. 

No one was in the corridor out- 
side, no one in sight in the hall. 

There was a thin electronic peep 
from the robot night-proctors, but 
that was all right. 'Master Cornut 
was no undergraduate, to wriggle 
under the scanning beams. It was 
his privilege to come and go as he 
chose. 

He chose to go. 

He walked out onto the campus, 
quiet under a yellow moon, the 
bridge overhead ghostly silver. 
There was no reason why he should 
be so emotionally on edge. Locille 
was only a student. 

The fact remained — he was on 
edge. 



52 



GALAXY 




But why should he be? Student 
marriage was good for the students, 
good for the masters; custom sanc- 
tioned it; and Master Carl, from 
the majesty of his house master’s 
post, he had suggested it in the first 
place. 

Queerly, he kept thinking of 
Egerd. 

There had been a look on young 
Egerd’s face, and maybe that was 
what bothered him. Master Cornut 
was not so many years past his 
sheepskin that he could dismiss the 
possible emotions of an undergrad- 
uate. Custom, privilege and law to 
one side, the fact remained that a 
student quite often did feel jealous 
of a master’s prerogatives. While a 
student, Cornut himself had con- 
tracted no liaisons to be interfered 
with. But other students had. And 
there was no doubt that, in Egerd’s 
immature, undergraduate way, he 
might well be jealous. 

13 UT what did that matter? 

Egerd’s jealousy could harm 
only himself. No serf, raging in- 
wardly against his lord’s jus primae 
noctis, was less able to make his 
anger felt than Egerd. But some- 
how Cornut was feeling it. 

He felt almost guilty. 

He was no logician; he was 
Mathematics. But this whole con- 
cept of right, he thought as he paced 
along the river bank, needed some 
study. What the world sanctioned 
was clear: The rights of the higher 

DRUNKARD’S WALK 



displaced the rights of the lower, as 
an atom of fluorine will drive oxy- 
gen out of a compound. But should 
it be that way? 

It was that way — if that was an 
answer. 

And all of class, all of privileges, 
all of law, seemed to be working 
to produce one single commodity— 
a product which, of all the world’s 
goods, is unique in that it has never 
been in short supply, never quite 
satisfied its demand and yet never 
failed to find a market: babies. 
Wherever you looked, babies. In 
the creches in the women’s dorms, 
in the playrooms attached to the 
rooms of the masters — babies. 

It was almost as though it had 
been planned that way; custom and 
law determined the fact that as 
many adult humans as possible 
spend as much of their time as pos- 
sible in performing the acts that 
made babies arrive. Why? What 
was the drive that produced so 
many babies? 

It wasn’t a matter of sex alone — 
it was babies. Sex was perfectly 
possible and joyous under condi- 
tions that made the occurrence of 
babies utterly impossible; science 
had arranged that decades, even 
centuries, before. But contracep- 
tion was no answer. And so, all 
over the world, this uncomplicated 
and unaided practice of baby-mak- 
ing added a clear two per cent to 
the world’s population every time 
the Earth sailed around the Sun. 



53 




Two per cent per year! 

There were now something over 
twelve billion persons alive. Next 
year’s census would show two per 
cent more than that. And why? 

What made babies so popular? 

Crazy as it was, the conclusion 
forced itself on Master Cornut: It 
was planned that way. 

By whom, he wondered, settling 
down to a long night’s thoughtful 
ramble and a pursuing of the line 
of thought to its last extreme — 

But not tonight, because he 
looked up and there was his own 
dorm. His feet had known more 
clearly than he the ultimate answer 
to the question: Babies? 

He was back at the entrance of 
Math Tower where the girl, Locille, 
was waiting. 

r ¥' , HE thing was — the bed. She 
had had a bed of her own 
moved into the room, for that was 
the way it was done; but of course 
there was his bed already there, 
much larger, so that — 

Well, which bed would she be in? 

He took a deep breath, nodded 
blindly to the unseeing electronic 
night-proctor, and opened the door 
of his room. 

A riotous alarm bell shattered 
the stillness. 

Master Cornut stood staring, 
stupidly, while the flesh-and-blood 
undergraduate charged with super- 
vising the corridors came peering 
worriedly around the comer, drawn 



by the sound; and the bell con- 
tinued to ring. Then he realized it 
was connected with the door. It was 
his automatic alarm bell, rigged by 
himself. But he had not connected 
it this night. 

He stepped in quickly, threw a 
scowl at the undergraduate, and 
closed the door. The ringing 
stopped. 

Locille was rising from the bed 
— his bed. 

Her hair was braided about her 
head and her eyes were downcast 
but bright. She had not been asleep. 
She said, “You must be tired. 
Would you like me to fetch you 
something to eat?” 

He said in a tremblingly stern 
voice, “Locille, why did you bug 
the door?” 

“Why, to wake me up when you 
came in. The bell was there. I only 
had to turn it on.” 

“And why?” 

“Why?” she said. “I wanted to.” 
And she yawned, rather prettily, 
and excused herself with a smile, 
and turned to straighten the covers 
on the bed. 

Cornut, watching her from be- 
hind as he had never watched her 
from the front, made note of two in- 
credible facts. 

The first was that this girl, Lo- 
cille, was beautiful. She was wear- 
ing very little, only a sleeping skirt 
and a sleeping yoke, and there was 
no doubt of her figure; and she was 
wearing no makeup that the eye 

GALAXY 



54 




could see, and there was no doubt 
about her face. 

Amazing, Cornut told himself, 
conscious of commotions inside 
himself, amazing, but I want this 
girl. I want her very much. 

And that led him to the other 
fact, which was more incredible 
still. 

He looked at her and knew what 
had never entered into his calcu- 
lations. It had never occurred to 
him that she might want him. 

r F' AP, tap. The girl shook him 
awake — fully awake. “What 
do you want?” Cornut cried crossly 
at the door. Beside him, Locille 
made a face, a sweet, a mock-arro- 
gant face, that was a tender carica- 
ture of his own; so that by the time 
the morning-proctor opened the 
door a crack and peered around it, 
Cornut was smiling at him. 

Wonders never-ceasing, thought 
the proctor, and said timidly, “Mas- 
ter Cornut, it is eight o’clock.” 

Cornut drew the covers over Lo- 
cille’s bare shoulder. “Go away,” he 
said. “Thanks, but go away.” 

The door closed, and one of Lo- 
cille’s pink slippers slapped lightly 
against it. She raised the other to 
toss after the first. Cornut caught 
her arm, laughing very softly; and 
she turned to him, not quite laugh- 
ing, and kissed him, and sprang 
away. 

“And stay awake,” she warned. 
“I have to go to class.” 

DRUNKARD’S WALK 



Cornut leaned back against the 
pillow. 

Why, it was a pleasant morning, 
he thought, and maybe in a way a 
pleasant world! It was perfectly 
astonishing what hues and bright- 
nesses there were in the world that 
he had either never suspected or 
long forgotten. He watched the 
girl, miraculously a part of his life, 
a segment joined on without a trace 
or seam where he *>ad never sus- 
pected a segment was missing. 

Quick-quick, she was dressed; 
much too quickly. “You,” said Cor- 
nut, “are in much too much of a 
hurry to get out of here.” 

Locille came and sat on the edge 
of the bed. Even in the uniform 
she was beautiful now. That was 
another amazing thing. It was like 
knowing that a chalice was purest 
gold under the enamel; the colors 
were the same, the design was the 
same; but suddenly what had been 
a factory product was become a 
work of art, simply through know- 
ing what graces lay underneath. 

She said, “That is because I am 
in a hurry to return.” She looked at 
him again, questioningly. “You 
won’t go back to sleep?” 

“Of course not.” She was frown- 
ing slightly, he saw with fondness, 
reminding him of the reason he had 
sought a companion in the first 
place — that old reason. 

She kissed him, rose, found her 
carry-all where she had left it on 
a chair, and her books. She caroled 



55 




softly to herself: “Strike the Twos 
and strike the Threes, the Sieve of 
Eratosthenes. When the multiples 
— Cornut, you’re sure you won’t go 
back to sleep?” 

“Sure.” 

She stood, hesitating with one 
hand on the door. She said doubt- 
fully, “Maybe you’d better take a 
wake-up pill. Will you?” 

“I will,” he said, rejoicing in be- 
ing nagged. 

“And you’d better start dressing 
in a few minutes. It’s only half an 
hour until your first class — ” 

“I know.” 

She blew him a kiss, and a smile; 
and she was gone. 

C ORNUT dutifully got up, 
found himself the pillbox with 
the red and green sleeping regula- 
tors, took one and returned to bed. 
He had never felt better in his life. 

He lay back against the pillow, 
utterly relaxed and at peace. He 
had bought himself an alarm clock 
and it turned out to be a wife. He 
smiled at the low cream ceiling and 
stretched and yawned. What a per- 
fectly fine bargain! What a super- 
perfect alarm clock! 

And that reminded him. He 
glanced at his watch, but he’d taken 
it off, and the wall clock was out of 
his angle of vision. Well, no matter; 
the wake-up pill would keep him 



from going back to sleep again. It 
felt as though he had been lying 
here half an hour, but it couldn’t be 
more than five minutes; that was 
how wake-up pills worked. 

He fumbled in the little divided 
box. Fortunate that they were 
handy; another pill would make 
doubly sure. 

He swallowed it, leaned back 
again and yawned. There was 
something about the pillow . 

He turned his head, sniffed, 
breathed deeply. Yes, there was Lo- 
cille about the pillow; that was 
what it was. Locille, who left a fra- 
grance behind her. Beautiful fra- 
grance of Locille. Beautiful name. 
Beautiful girl. He caught himself 
yawning again — 

Yawning? 

Yawning! 

He blinked the eyes that were 
much too heavy, and tried to turn 
the very weary head. Yawning! 
But after two wake-up pills — or 
was it three — or six? 

History was repeating! 

Red pills for wake-up, green for 
sleep. The green pills, he sobbed in 
his thoughts, he’d been taking the 
green ones! 

Oh, Lord, he whimpered sound- 
lessly — oh, Lord, why now? Why 
did you wait to catch me until I 
cared?

Earth was being bet on to break 
her blockade . but what was the 
purse . and who was to collect ? 



By L. J. STECHER, JR. 



T HE sight of an Earthman 
on Vega III, where it was 
impossible for an outlander 
to be, brought angry crowds to sur- 
round John Crownwall as he strode 
toward the palace of Viceroy 
Tronn Ffallk, ruler of Sector XII 
of the Universal Holy Empire of 
Sunda. He ignored the snarling, the 
spitting, the waving of boneless 
prehensile fingers, as he ignored the 
heavy gravity and heavier air of 
the unfamiliar planet. 



John Crownwall, florid, red- 
headed and bulky, considered him- 
self to be a bold man. But here, 
surrounded by this writhing, slith- 
ering mass of eight-foot creatures, 
he felt distinctly unhappy. Crown- 
wall had heard about creatures that 
slavered, but he had never before 
seen it done. These humanoids had 
large mouths and sharp teeth, and 
they unquestionably slavered. He 
wished he knew more about them. 
If they carried out the threats of

their present attitude, Earth would 
have to send Marshall to replace 
him. And if Crownwall couldn’t do 
the job, thought Crownwall, then 
it was a sure bet that Marshall 
wouldn’t have a chance. 

He climbed the great ramp, with 
its deeply carved Greek key de- 
sign, toward the mighty entrance 
gate of the palace. His manner 
demonstrated an elaborate air of 
unconcern that he felt sure was en- 
tirely wasted on these monsters. 
The clashing teeth of the noisiest 
of them were only inches from the 
quivering flesh of his back as he 
reached the upper level. Instantly, 
and unexpectedly to Crownwall, 
the threatening crowd dropped 
back fearfully, so that he walked 
the last fifty meters alone. 

Crownwall all but sagged with 
relief. A pair of guards, their purple 
hides smoothly polished and gleam- 
ing with oil, crossed their cere- 
monial pikes in front of him as he 
approached the entrance. 

“And just what business do you 
have here, stranger?” asked the 
senior of the guards, his speaking 
orifice framing with difficulty the 
sibilances of Universal Galactic. 

“What business would I have at 
the Viceroy’s Palace?” asked 
Crownwall. “I want to see Ffallk.” 

“Mind your tongue,” growled 
the guard. “If you mean His Efful- 
gence, Right Hand of the Glorious 
Emperor, Hereditary Ruler of the 
Seventy Suns, Viceroy of the 



Twelfth Sector of the Universal 
Holy Empire”— Universal Galactic 
had a full measure of ceremonial 
words— “he sees only those whom 
he summons. If you know what’s 
good for you, you’ll get out of here 
while you can still walk. And if you 
run fast enough, maybe you can 
even get away from that crowd out 
there, but I doubt it.” 

“Just tell him that a man has 
arrived from Earth to talk to him. 
He’ll summon me fast enough. 
Meanwhile, my highly polished 
friends, I’ll just wait here, so why 
don’t you put those heavy pikes 
down?” 

Crownwall sat on the steps, 
puffed alight a cigarette, and blew 
expert smoke rings toward the 
guards. 

An elegant courtier, with elabo- 
rately jeweled harness, bustled 
from inside the palace, obviously 
trying to present an air of strolling 
nonchalance. He gestured fluidly 
with a graceful tentacle. “You!” he 
said to Crownwall. “Follow me. His 
Effulgence commands you to ap- 
pear before him at once.” The two 
guards withdrew their pikes and 
froze into immobility at the sides 
of the entrance. 

Crownwall stamped out his 
smoke and ambled after the hurry- 
ing courtier along tremendous cor- 
ridors, through elaborate waiting 
rooms, under guarded doorways, 
until he was finally bowed through 
a small curtained arch.

At the far side of the comfort- 
able, unimpressive room, a plump 
thing, hide faded to a dull violet, 
reclined on a couch. Behind him 
stood a heavy and pompous ap- 
pearing Vegan in lordly trappings. 
They examined Crownwall with 
great interest for a few moments. 

“It’s customary to genuflect 
when you enter the Viceroy’s pres- 
ence,” said the standing one at 
last “But then I’m told you’re an 
Earthling. I suppose we can expect 
you to be ignorant of those niceties' 
customary among civilized peo- 
ples.” 

“It’s all right, Ggaran,” said the 
Viceroy languidly. He twitched a 
tentacle in a beckoning gesture. 
“Come closer, Earthling. I bid you 
welcome to my capital. I have been 
looking forward to your arrival for 
some time.” 

C ROWNWALL put his hands 
in his pockets. “That’s hardly 
possible,” he said. “It was only de- 
cided yesterday, back on Earth, 
that I would be the one to make 
the trip here. Even if you could 
spy through buildings on Earth 
from space, which I doubt, your 
communications system can’t get 
the word through that fast.” 

“Oh, I didn’t mean you in par- 
ticular,” the Vegan said with a 
negligent wave. “Who can tell one 
Earthling from another? What I 
meant was that I expected some- 
one from Earth to break through 



our blockade and come here. Most 
of my advisors — even Ggaran here 
— thought it couldn’t be done, but 
I never doubted that you’d man- 
age it. Still, if you were on your 
home planet only yesterday, that’s 
astonishing even to me. Tell me, 
how did you manage to get here so 
fast, and without even alerting my 
detection web?” 

“You’re doing the talking,” said 
Crownwall. “If you wanted some- 
one from Earth to come here to see 
you, why did you put the cordon 
around Earth? And why did you 
drop a planet-buster in the Pacific 
Ocean, and tell us that it was trig- 
gered to go off if we tried to use 
the distorter drive? That’s hardly 
the action of somebody who ex- 
pects visitors.” 

Ffallk glanced up at Ggaran. “I 
told you that Earthlings were un- 
believably bold.” He turned back 
to Crownwall. “If you couldn’t 
come to me in spite of the trifling 
inconveniences I put in your way, 
your presence here would be use- 
less to both of us. But you did 
come, so I can tell you that al- 
though I am the leader of one of 
the mightiest peoples in the Gal- 
axy, whereas there are scarcely six 
billions of you squatting on one 
minor planet, we still need each 
other. Together, there is nothing 
we can’t do.” 

“I’m listening,” said Crownwell. 

“We offer you partnership with 
us to take over the rule of the 



60 



GALAXY 




Galaxy from the Sunda - the so- 
called Master Race.” 

“It would hardly be an equal 
partnership, would it, considering 
that there are so many more of you 
than there are of us?” 

His Effulgence twitched his ear 
stalks in amusement. “I’m Viceroy 
of one of the hundred Sectors of 
the Empire. I rule over a total of 
a hundred Satrapies; these average 
about a hundred Provinces each. 
Provinces consist, in general, of 
about a hundred Clusters apiece, 
and every Cluster has an average 
of a hundred inhabited solar sys- 
tems. There are more inhabited 
planets in the Galaxy than there 
are people on your single world. 
I, personally, rule three hundred 
trillion people, half of them of my 
own race. And yet I tell you that 
it would be an equal partnership.” 
“I don’t get it. Why?” 

“Because you came to me.” 
Crownwall shrugged. “So?” 

TP HE Vegan reached up and en- 
*"• gulfed the end of a drinking 
tube with his eating orifice. “You 
upstart Earthlings are a strange 
and a frightening race,” he said. 
“Frightening to the Sunda, espe- 
cially. When you showed up in the 
spaceways, it was decreed that you 
had to be stopped at once. There 
was even serious discussion of de- 
stroying Earth out of hand, while 
it is still possible. 

“Your silly little planet was care- 



fully examined at long range in a 
routine investigation just about fif- 
ty thousand years ago. There were 
at that time three different but 
similar racial strains of pulpy bi- 
peds, numbering a total of perhaps 
a hundred thousand individuals. 
They showed many signs of an 
ability to reason, but a complete 
lack of civilization. While these 
creatures could by no means be 
classed among the intelligent races, 
there was a general expectation, 
which we reported to the Sunda, 
that they would some day come to 
be numbered among the Servants 
of the Emperor. So we let you 
alone, in order that you could de- 
velop in your own way, until you 
reached a high enough civilization 
to be useful — if you were going to. 

“Intelligence is very rare in the 
Galaxy. In all, it has been found 
only fifteen times. The other races 
we have watched develop, and 
some we have actively assisted to 
develop. It took the quickest of 
them just under a million years. 
One such race we left uncontrolled 
too long — but no matter. 

“You Earthlings, in defiance of 
all expectation and all reason, have 
exploded into space. You have de- 
veloped in an incredibly short 
space of time. But even that isn’t 
the most disconcerting item of your 
development. As an Earthling, you 
have heard of the details of the 
first expedition of your people into 
space, of course?” 



UPSTARTS

“Heard about it?” exclaimed 
Crownwall. “I was on it.” He set- 
tled down comfortably on a couch, 
without requesting permission, and 
thought back to that first tremen- 
dous adventure; an adventure that 
had taken place little more than 
ten years before. 

The Star Seeker had been built 
in space, about forty thousand kilo- 
meters above the Earth. It had 
been manned by a dozen adven- 
turous people, captained by Crown- 
wall, and had headed out on its ion 
drive until it was safely clear of 
the warping influence of planetary 
masses. Then, after several impa- 
tient days of careful study and cal- 
culation, the distorter drive had 
been activated, for the first time 
in Earth’s history, and, for the 
twelve, the stars had winked out. 

The men of Earth had decided 
that it should work in theory. They 
had built the drive — a small ma- 
chine, as drives go — but they had 
never dared to try it, close to a 
planet. To do so, said their theory, 
would usually — seven point three 
four times out of 10 — destroy the 
ship, and everything in space for 
thousands of miles around, in a 
ravening burst of raw energy. 

So the drive had been used for 
the first time without ever having 
been tested. And it had worked. 

In less than a week’s time, if 
time has any meaning under such 
circumstances, they had flickered 
back into normal space, in die vi- 



cinity of Alpha Centauri. They had 
quickly located a dozen planets, 
and one that looked enough like 
Earth to be its twin sister. They 
had headed for that planet confi- 
dently and unsuspectingly, using 
the ion drive. 

Two weeks later, while they 
were still several planetary diam- 
eters from their destination, they 
had been shocked to find more 
than two score alien ships of space 
closing in on them — ships that 
were swifter and more maneuver- 
able than their own. These ships 
had rapidly and competently en- 
globed the Star Seeker, and had 
then tried to herd it away from the 
planet it had been heading toward. 

A LTHOUGH caught by sur- 
prise, the Earthmen had acted 
swiftly. Crownwall recalled the dis- 
cussion — the council of war, they 
had called it — and their unanimous 
decision. Although far within the 
dangerous influence of a planetary 
mass, they had again activated the 
distorter drive, and they had beaten 
the odds. On the distorter drive, 
they had returned to Earth as swift- 
ly as they had departed. Earth had 
immediately prepared for war 
against her unknown enemy. 

“Your reaction was savage,” said 
Ggaran, his tentacles stiffening 
with shock at the memory. “You 
bloody-minded Earthlings must 
have been aware of the terrible 
danger.” 



UPSTARTS

Ffallk rippled in agreement. 
“The action you took was too swift 
and too foolhardy to be believed. 
You knew that you could have de- 
stroyed not only yourself, but also 
all who live on that planet. You 
could also have wrecked the planet 
itself and the ships and those of 
my own race who manned them. 
We had tried to contact you, but 
since you had not developed sub- 
space radio, we were of course not 
successful. Our englobement was 
just a routine quarantine. With 
your total lack of information 
about us, what you did was more 
than the height of folly. It was mad- 
ness.” 

“Could we have done anything 
else that would have kept you from 
landing on Earth and taking us 
over?” asked Crownwall. 

“Would that have been so bad?” 
said Ggaran. “We can’t tolerate 
wild and warlike races running free 
and uncontrolled in the Galaxy. 
Once was enough for that.” 

“But what about my question? 
Was there any other way for us to 
stay free?” 

“Well, no. But you didn’t have 
enough information to realize that 
when you acted so precipitously. As 
a matter of fact, we didn’t expect 
to have much trouble, even after 
your surprising action. Of course, 
it took us a little time to react. We 
located your planet quickly enough, 
and confirmed that you were a new 
race. But by the time we could 



try to set up communications and 
send ambassadors, you had already 
organized a not inconsiderable de- 
fense. Your drones blew up our un- 
manned ships as fast as we could 
send them down to your planet. 
And by the time we had organized 
properly for war against you, it was 
obvious that we could not conquer 
you. We could only destroy you.” 

“That old fool on Sunda, the 
Emperor, decided that we should 
blow you up, but by that time I 
had decided,” said His Effulgence, 
“that you might be useful to me— 
that is, that we might be useful to 
each other. I traveled halfway 
across the Galaxy to meet him, to 
convince him that it would be suf- 
ficient just to quarantine yot|. 
When we had used your radio sys- 
tem to teach a few of you the Uni- 
versal Galactic tongue, and had 
managed to get what you call the 
‘planet buster’ down into the 
largest of your oceans, he figured 
we had done our job. 

“With his usual lack of imagina- 
tion, he felt sure that we were safe 
from you — after all, there was no 
way for you to get off the planet. 
Even if you could get down to the 
bottom of the ocean and tamper 
with the bomb, you would only suc- 
ceed in setting it off, and that’s 
what the Sunda had been in favor 
of in the first place. 

“But I had different ideas. From 
what you had already done, I sus- 
pected it wouldn’t be long before

GALAXY 




one of you amazing Earthlings 
would dream up some device or 
other, head out into space, and 
show up on our planet. So I’ve been 
waiting for you, and here you are.” 

“It was the thinking of a genius,” 
murmured Ggaran. 

“All right, then, genius, here I 
am,” said Crownwall. “So what’s 
the pitch?” 

“Ggaran, you explain it to the 
Earthling,” said His Effulgence. 

GARAN bowed. “The crusta- 
^ ceans on Sunda — the lobster- 
like creatures that rule the Galaxy 

— are usurpers. They have no rights 
to their position of power. Our race 
is much older than theirs. We were 
alone when we found the Sundans 

— a primitive tribe, grubbing in the 
mud at the edge of their shallow 
seas, unable even to reason. In 
those days we were desperately 
lonely. We needed companionship 
among the stars, and we helped 
them develop to the point where, 
in their inferior way, they were able 
to reason, almost as well as we, The 
People, can. And then they cheated 
us of our rightful place. 

“The Emperor at Sunda is one 
of them. They provide sixty-eight 
of the hundred Viceroys; we pro- 
vide only seventeen. It is a prepos- 
terous and intolerable situation. 

“For more than two million 
years we have waited for the op- 
portunity for revenge. And now 
that you have entered space, that 



opportunity is at hand.” 

“If you haven’t been able to help 
yourselves for two million years,” 
asked Crownwall, “how does the 
sight of me give you so much gump- 
tion all of a sudden?” 

Ggaran’s tentacles writhed, and 
he slavered in fury, but the clash- 
ing of his teeth subsided instantly 
at a soothing wave from His Efful- 
gence. 

“War in space is almost an im- 
possibility,” said the aged ruler. 
“We can destroy planets, of course, 
but with few exceptions, we can- 
not conquer them. I rule a total of 
seven races in my Sector. I rule 
them, but I don’t let them inter- 
mingle. Each race settles on the 
planets that best suit it. Each of 
those planets is quite capable of de- 
fending itself from raids, or even 
large-scale assaults that would re- 
sult in its capture and subjugation 
— just as your little Earth can de- 
fend itself. 

“Naturally, each is vulnerable to 
economic blockade— trade provides 
a small but vital portion of the 
goods each planet uses. All that a 
world requires for a healthy and 
comfortable life cannot be pro- 
vided from the resources of that 
single world alone, and that gives 
us a very considerable measure of 
control. 

“And it is true that we can al- 
ways exterminate any planet that 
refuses to obey the just and legal 
orders of its Viceroy. So we achieve

a working balance in our Empire. 
We control it adequately, and we 
live in peace. 

“The Sundans, for example, 
though they took the rule of the 
Empire that was rightfully ours 
away from usj through trickery, 
were unable to take over the 
Sectors we control. We are still 
powerful. And soon we will be all- 
powerfull. In company with you 
Earthlings, that is.” 

Crownwall nodded. “In other 
words, you think that we Earth- 
men can break up this two-million- 
year-old stalemate. You’ve got the 
idea that, with our help, you can 
conquer planets without the neces- 
sity of destroying them, and there- 
by take over number one spot from 
these Sunda friends of yours.” 

“Don’t call those damn lobsters 
friends,” growled Ggaran. He sub- 
sided at the Viceroy’s gesture. 

“Exactly,” said His Effulgence 
to Crownwall. “You broke our 
blockade without any trouble. Our 
instruments didn’t even wiggle 
when you landed here on my capi- 
tal world. You can do the same on 
the worlds of the Sunda. Now, just 
tell us how you did it, and we’re 
partners.” 

ROWNWALL lifted one eye- 
^ brow quizzically, but remained 
silent. He didn’t expect his facial 
gesture to be interpreted correctly, 
but he assumed that his silence 
would be. He was correct. 



“Of course,” His Effugence said, 
“we will give you any assurances 
that your people may desire in or- 
der to feel safe, and we will guar- 
antee them an equal share in the 
government of the Galaxy.” 

“Bunk,” said Crownwall. 

His Effulgence lifted a tentacle 
swiftly, before Ggaran, lunging an- 
grily forward, could speak. “Then 
what do you want of us?” 

“It seems to me that we need 
no wordy assurances from each 
other,” said Crownwall, and he 
puffed a cigarette aglow. “We can 
arrange something a little more 
trustworthy, I believe. On your 
side, you have the power to destroy 
our only planet at any time. That 
is certainly adequate security for 
our own good behavior and sin- 
cerity. 

“It is impossible for us of Earth 
to destroy all of your planets. As 
you have said, there are more plan- 
ets that belong to you than there 
are human beings on Earth. But 
there is a way for us to be reason- 
ably sure that you will behave 
yourselves. You will transfer to us, 
at once, a hundred of your planet- 
destroying bombs. That will be a 
sufficient supply to let us test some 
of them, to see that they are in 
good working order. Then, if you 
try any kind of doublecross, we 
will be able to use our own meth- 
ods — which you cannot prevent — 
to send one of those bombs here to 
destroy this planet. 



68 



GALAXY 




“And if you try to move any- 
where else, by your clumsy dis- 
torter drive, we can follow you, and 
destroy any planet you choose to 
land on. You would not get away 
from us. We can track you without 
any difficulty. 

“We wouldn’t use the bombs 
lightly, to be sure, because of what 
would happen to Earth. And don’t 
think that blowing up our planet 
would save you, because we natu- 
rally wouldn’t keep the bombs on 
Earth. How does that sound to 
you?” 

“Ridiculous,” snorted Ggaran. 
“Impossible.” 

After several minutes of silent 
consideration, “It is an excellent 
plan,” said His Effulgence. “It is 
worthy of the thinking of The Peo- 
ple ourselves. You Earthlings will 
make very satisfactory allies. What 
you request will be provided with- 
out delay. Meanwhile, I see no rea- 
son why we cannot proceed with 
our discussions.” 

“Nor do I,” consented Crown- 
wall. “But your stooge here doesn’t 
seem very happy about it all.” 

His Effulgence wiggled his ten- 
tacles. “I’m afraid that Ggaran had 
expected to take what you Earth- 
lings have to offer without giving 
anything in return. I never had any 
such ideas. I have not underesti- 
mated you, you see.” 

“That’s nice,” said Crownwall 
graciously. 

“And now,” Ggaran put in, “I 



think it’s time for you to tell us 
something about how you get 
across light-years of space in a few 
hours, without leaving any traces 
for us to detect” He raised a ten- 
tacle to still Crownwall’s imme- 
diate exclamation of protest. “Oh, 
nothing that would give us a chance 
to duplicate it — just enough to 
indicate how we can make use of 
it, along with you — enough to al- 
low us to begin to make intelligent 
plans to beat the claws off the Mas- 
ter Race.” 

A FTER due consideration, 
Crownwall nodded. “I don’t 
see why not. Well, then, let me tell 
you that we don’t travel in space 
at all. That’s why I didn’t show up 
on any of your long-range detec- 
tion instruments. Instead, we travel 
in time. Surely any race that has 
progressed as far as your own must 
know, at least theoretically, that 
time travel is entirely possible. Af- 
ter all, we knew it, and we haven’t 
been around nearly as long as you 
have.” 

“We know about it,” said Ffallk, 
“but we’ve always considered it 
useless — and very dangerous — 
knowledge.” 

“So have we, up until the time 
you planted that bomb on us. Any- 
one who tried to work any changes 
in his own past would be almost 
certain to end up finding himself 
never having been bom. So we 
don’t do any meddling. What we 



UPSTARTS 



69 




have discovered is a way not only 
of moving back into the past, but 
also of making our own choice of 
spatial references while we do it, 
and of changing our spatial anchor 
at will. 

“For example, to reach this 
planet, I went back far enough, us- 
ing Earth as the spatial referent, 
to move with Earth a little more 
than a third of the way around this 
spiral nebula that is our Galaxy. 
Then I shifted my frame of refer- 
ence to that of the group of galaxies 
of which ours is such a distin- 
guished member. 

“Then of course, as I continued 
to move in time, the whole Galaxy 
moved spatially with reference to 
my own position. At the proper in- 
stant I shifted again, to the refer- 
ence frame of this Galaxy itself. 
Then I was stationary in the Gal- 
axy, and as I continued time travel- 
ing, your own mighty sun moved 
toward me as the Galaxy revolved. 
I chose a point where there was a 
time intersection of your planet’s 
position and my own. When you 
got there, I just changed to the ref- 
erence plane of this planet I’m on 
now, and then came on back with 
it to the present. So here I am. It 
was a long way around to cover a 
net distance of 26 light-years, but 
it was really very simple. 

“And there’s no danger of meet- 
ing myself, or getting into any ana- 
chronistic situation. As you prob- 
ably know, theory shows that these 



are excluded times for me, as is the 
future — I can’t stop in them.” 

“Are you sure that you haven’t 
given us a little too much informa- 
tion for your own safety?” asked 
Ffallk softly. 

“Not at all. We were enormously 
lucky to have learned how to con- 
trol spatial reference frames our- 
selves. I doubt if you could do it in 
another two million years.” Crown- 
wall rose to his feet “And now, 
Your Effulgence, I think it’s about 
time I went back to my ship and 
drove it home to Earth to make my 
report, so we can pick up those 
bombs and start making arrange- 
ments.” 

“Excellent,” said Ffallk. “I’d bet- 
ter escort you; my people don’t like 
strangers much.” 

“I’d noticed that,” Crownwall 
commented drily. 

“Since this is a very important 
occasion, I think it best that we 
make this a Procession of Full 
Ceremony. It’s a bother, but the 
proprieties have to be observed.” 

/ ^ GARAN stepped out into the 
^ broad corridor and whistled a 
shrill two-tone note, using both his 
speaking and his eating orifices. A 
cohort of troops, pikes at the ready 
and bows strapped to their backs, 
leaped forward and formed a 
double line leading from His Efful- 
gence’s sanctum to the main door. 
Down this lane, carried by twenty 
men, came a large sedan chair. 



70 



GALAXY 




“Protocol takes a lot of time,” 
said His Effulgence somewhat sad- 
ly, “but it must be observed. At 
least, as Ambassador, you can ride 
with me in the sedan, instead of 
walking behind it, like Ggaran.” 
“I’m glad of that,” said Crown- 
wall. “Too bad Ggaran can’t join 
us.” He climbed into the chair be- 
side Ffallk. The bearers trotted 
along at seven or eight kilometers 
an hour, carrying their contraption 
with absolute smoothness. Blasts 
from horns preceded them as they 
went. 

When they passed through the 
huge entrance doors of the palace 
and started down the ramp toward 
the street, Crownwall was aston- 
ished to see nobody on the previ- 
ously crowded streets, and men- 
tioned it to Ffallk. 

“When the Viceroy of the Sev- 
enty Suns,” said the Viceroy of the 
Seventy Suns, “travels in state, no 
one but my own entourage is per- 
mitted to watch. And my guests, of 
course,” he added, bowing slight- 
ly to Crownwall. 

“Of course,” agreed Crownwall, 
bowing back. “Kind of you, I’m 
sure. But what happens if some- 
body doesn’t get the word, or 
doesn’t hear your trumpeters, or 
something like that?” 

Ggaran stepped forward, already 
panting slightly. “A man with knots 
in all of his ear stalks is in a very 
uncomfortable position,” he ex- 
plained. “Wait. Let me show you. 



Let us just suppose that that run- 
ner over there” — he gestured to- 
ward a soldier with a tentacle — 
“is a civilian who has been so un- 
lucky as to remain on the street 
after His Effulgence’s entourage ar- 
rived.” He turned to one of the 
bowmen who ran beside the sedan 
chair, now. strung and at the ready. 
“Show him!” he ordered peremp- 
torily. 

In one swift movement the bow- 
man notched an arrow, drew and 
fired. The arrow hissed briefly, and 
then sliced smoothly through the 
soldier’s throat. 

“You see,” said Ggaran compla- 
cently, “we have very little trouble 
with civilians who violate this par- 
ticular tradition.” 

His Effulgence beckoned to the 
bowman to approach. “Your results 
were satisfactory,” he said, “but 
your release was somewhat shaky. 
The next time you show such slop- 
py form, you will be given thirty 
lashes.” 

He leaned back on the cushion 
and spoke again to Crownwall. 
“That’s the trouble with these re- 
quirements of civilization. The men 
of my immediate guard must prac- 
tice with such things as pikes and 
bows and arrows, which they sel- 
dom get an opportunity to use. It 
would never do for them to use 
modern weapons on occasions of 
ceremony, of course.” 

“Of course,” said Crownwall, 
then added, “It’s too bad that you 



UPSTARTS 



71 




can’t provide them with live tar- 
gets a little more often.” He stifled 
a shudder of distaste. “Tell me, 
Your Effulgence, does the Em- 
peror’s race — the Master Race — 
also enjoy the type of civilization 
you have just had demonstrated 
for me?” 

“Oh, no. They are far too brutal, 
too morally degraded, to know any- 
thing of these finer points of eti- 
quette and propriety. They are 
really an uncouth bunch. Why, do 
you know, I am certain that they 
would have had the bad taste to 
use an energy weapon to dispose 
of the victim in a case such as you 
just witnessed! They are really 
quite unfit to rule. They can scarce- 
ly be called civilized at all. But we 
will soon pur a stop to all of that— 
your race and mine, of course.” 

“I sincerely hope so,” said 
Crownwall. 

O EFRESHMENTS were served 
to His Effulgence and to 
Crownwall during the trip, with- 
out interrupting the smooth pro- 
gress of the sedan. The soldiers of 
the cohort, the bearers and Ggaran 
continued to run — without food, 
drink or, except for Ggaran, evi- 
dence of fatigue. 

After several hours of travel, fol- 
lowing Crownwall’s directions, the 
procession arrived at the copse in 
which he had concealed his small 
transportation machine. The ma- 
chine, for spatial mobility, was 



equipped with the heavy and gross- 
ly inefficient anti-gravity field gen- 
erator developed by Kowalsky. It 
occupied ten times the space of the 
temporal translation and coordina- 
tion selection systems combined, 
but it had the great advantage of 
being almost indetectable in use. It 
emitted no mass or radiation. 

After elaborate and lengthy fare- 
wells, Crownwall climbed into his 
machine and fell gently up until he 
was out of the atmosphere, before 
starting his enormous journey 
through time back to Earth. More 
quickly than it had taken him to 
reach his ship from the palace of 
His Effulgence, he was in the Coun- 
cil Chamber of the Confederation 
Government of Earth, making a full 
report on his trip to Vega. 

When he had finished, the Pres- 
ident sighed deeply. “Well,” he 
said, “we gave you full plenipoten- 
tiary powers, so I suppose we’ll 
have to stand behind your agree- 
ments — especially in view of the 
fact that we’ll undoubtedly be 
blown into atoms if we don’t. But 
from what you say, I’d rather be 
in bed with a rattler than have a 
treaty with a Vegan. They sound 
ungodly murderous to me. There 
are too many holes in that protec- 
tion plan of yours. It’s only a ques- 
tion of time before they’ll find some 
way around it, and then — poof — 
we’ll all be dust.” 

“Things may not be as bad as 
they seem,” answered Crownwall 



72 



GALAXY 




complacently. “After I got back a 
few million years, I’m afraid I got 
a little careless and let my ship dip 
down into Vega Ill’s atmosphere 
for a while. I was back so far that 
the Vegans hadn’t appeared yet. 
Now, I didn’t land — or deliberate- 
ly kill anything — but I’d be mighty 
surprised if we didn’t find a change 
or two. Before I came in here, I 
asked Marshall to take the ship out 
and check on things. He should be 
back with his report before long. 
Why don’t we wait and see what 
he has to say?” 

jVT ARSHALL was excited when 
he was escorted into the 
Council Chamber. He bowed brief- 
ly to the President and began to 
speak rapidly. 

“They’re gone without trace — 
all of them!" he cried. “I went clear 



to Sunda and there’s no sign of 
intelligent life anywhere! We’re all 
alone now!” 

“There, you see?” exclaimed 
Crownwall. “Our enemies are all 
gone!” 

He looked around, glowing with 
victory, at the others at the table, 
then slowly quieted and sat down. 
He turned his head away from 
their accusing eyes. 

“Alone,” he said, and uncon- 
sciously repeated Marshall’s words: 
“We’re all alone now.” 

In silence, the others gathered 
their papers together and left the 
room, leaving Crownwall sitting at 
the table by himself. He shivered 
involuntarily, and then leaped to 
his feet to follow after them. 

Loneliness, he found, was some- 
thing that he couldn’t face alone.

The ship itself occasioned some 
excitement, but back there at the 
tattered end of the 20th century, 
what was one visiting spaceship 
more or less? Others had appeared 
before, and gone away discouraged 
— or just not bothering. 3-dimen- 
sional TV was coming out of the 
experimental stage. Soon anyone 
could have Dora the Doll or the 
Grandson of Tarzan smack in his 
own living-room. Besides, it was a 
hot summer. 

The first knowledge of the es- 
cape came when the region of 
Seattle suffered an eclipse of the 
sun, which was not an eclipse but 
a near shadow, which was not a 
shadow but a thing. The darkness 
drifted out of the northern Pacific. 
It generated thunder without light- 
ning and without rain. When it had 
moved eastward and the hot sun 
reappeared, wind followed, a mod- 
erate gale. The coast was battered 
by sudden high waves, then hushed 
in a bewilderment of fog. 

Before that appearance, radar 
had gone crazy for an hour. 

The atmosphere buzzed with 
aircraft. They went up in readiness 
to shoot, but after the first sighting 
reports only a few miles offshore, 
that order was vehemently can- 
celed — someone in charge must 
have had a grain of sense. The 
thing was not a plane, rocket or 
missile. It was an animal. 

If you shoot an animal that re- 
sembles an inflated gas-bag with 



wings, and the wingspread happens 
to be something over four miles tip 
to tip, and the carcass drops on a 
city — it’s not nice for the city. 

The Office of Continental De- 
fense deplored the lack of pre- 
cedent. But actually none was 
needed. You just don’t drop four 
miles of dead or dying alien flesh 
on Seattle or any other part of a 
swarming homeland. You wait till 
it flies out over the ocean, if it will 
— the most commodious ocean in 
reach. 

IT, or rather she, didn’t go back 
over the Pacific, perhaps be- 
cause of the prevailing westerlies. 
After the Seattle incident she 
climbed to a great altitude above 
the Rockies, apparently using an 
updraft with very little wing-mo- 
tion. There was no means of calcu- 
lating her weight, or mass, or buoy- 
ancy. Dead or injured, drift might 
have carried her anywhere within 
one or two hundred miles. Then 
she seemed to be following the line 
of the Platte and the Missouri. By 
the end of the day she was circling 
interminably over the huge com- 
plex of St. Louis, hopelessly cry- 
ing. 

She had a head, drawn back most 
of the time into the bloated mass 
of the body but thrusting forward 
now and then on a short neck not 
more than three hundred feet in 
length. When she did that the blunt 
turtle-like head could be observed, 



THE GOOD NEIGHBORS 



75 




the gaping, toothless, suffering 
mouth from which the thunder 
came, and the soft-shining purple 
eyes that searched the ground but 
found nothing answering her need. 
The skin-color was mud-brown 
with some dull iridescence and 
many peculiar marks resembling 
weals or blisters. Along the belly 
some observers saw half a mile of 
paired protuberances that looked 
like teats. 

She was unquestionably the 
equivalent of a vertebrate. Two 
web-footed legs were drawn up. 
close against the cigar-shaped body. 
The vast, rather narrow, inflated 
wings could not have been held or 
moved in flight without a strong in- 
ternal skeleton and musculature. 
Theorists later argued that she 
must have come from a planet with 
a high proportion of water surface, 
a planet possibly larger than Earth 
though of about the same mass and 
with a similar atmosphere. She 
could rise in Earth’s air. And be- 
fore each thunderous lament sihe 
was seen to breathe. 

It was assumed that immense air 
sacs within her body were inflated 
or partly inflated when she left the 
ship, possibly with some gas lighter 
than nitrogen. Since it was incon- 
ceivable that a vertebrate organism 
could have survived entry into at- 
mosphere from an orbit 3400 miles 
up, it was necessary to believe that 
the ship had briefly descended, un- 
observed and by unknown means, 



probably on Earth's night-side. 
Later on the ship did descend as 
far as atmosphere, for a moment . 

St. Louis was partly evacuated. 
There is no reliable estimate of the 
loss of life and property from panic 
and accident on the jammed roads 
and rail lines. 1500 dead, 7400 in- 
jured is the conservative figure. 

A FTER a night and a day she 
abandoned that area, flying 
heavily eastward. The droning and 
swooping gnats of aircraft plainly 
distressed her. At first she had only 
tried to avoid them, but now and 
then during her eastward flight from 
St. Louis she made short desperate 
rushes against them, without skill 
or much sign of intelligence, 
screaming from a wide-open mouth 
that could have swallowed a four- 
engine bomber. Two aircraft were 
lost over Cincinnati, by collision 
with each other in trying to get out 
of her way. Pilots were then or- 
dered to keep a distance of not less 
than ten miles until such time as 
she reached the Atlantic — if she 
did — when she could safely be 
shot down. 

She studied Chicago for a day. 

By that time Civil Defense was 
better prepared. About a million 
residents had already fled to open 
country before she came, and the 
loss of life was proportionately 
smaller. She moved on. We have 
no clue to the reason why great 
cities should have attracted her, 



THE GOOD NEIGHBORS 



77 




though apparently they did. She 
was hungry perhaps, or seeking 
help, or merely drawn in animal 
curiosity by the endless motion of 
the cities and the strangeness. It 
has even been suggested that the 
life forms of her homeland — her 
masters— resembled humanity. She 
moved eastward, and religious or- 
ganizations united to pray that she 
would come down on one of the 
lakes where she could safely be de- 
stroyed. She didn’t. 

She approached Pittsburgh, 
choked and screamed and flew high, 
and soared in weary circles over 
Buffalo for a day and a night. Some 
pilots who had followed the flight 
from the West Coast claimed that 
the vast lamentation of her voice 
was growing fainter and hoarser 
while she was drifting along the 
line of the Mohawk Valley. She 
turned south, following the Hud- 
son at no great height. Sometimes 
she appeared to be choking, the 
labored inhalations harsh and pro- 
longed, like a cloud in agony. 

When she was over Westchester, 
headquarters tripled the swarm 
of interceptors and observation 
planes. Squadrons from Connecti- 
cut and southern New Jersey de- 
ployed to form a monstrous funnel, 
the small end before her, the large 
end pointing out to open sea. 
Heavy bombers closed in above, 
laying a smoke screen at 10,000 
feet to discourage her from rising. 
The ground shook with the drone 



of jets, and with her crying. 

Multitudes had abandoned the 
metropolitan area. Other multi- 
tudes trusted to the subways, to 
the narrow street canyons and to 
the strength of concrete and steel. 
Others climbed to a thousand high 
places and watched, trusting the 
laws of chance. 

She passed over Manhattan in 
the evening — between 8 : 14 and 
8:27 P.M., July 16, 1976 - at an 
altitude of about 2000 feet. She 
swerved away from the aircraft 
that blanketed Long Island and the 
Sound, swerved again as the south- 
ern group buzzed her instead of 
giving way. She made no attempt 
to rise into the sun-crimsoned ter- 
ror of drifting smoke. 

r I A HE plan was intelligent. It 
should have worked, but for one 
fighter pilot who jumped the gun. 

He said later that he himself 
couldn’t understand what hap- 
pened. It was court-martial testi- 
mony, but his reputation had been 
good. He was Bill Green — William 
Hammond Green — of New Lon- 
don, Connecticut, flying a one-man 
jet fighter, well aware of the strict- 
est orders not to attack until the 
target had moved at least ten miles 
east of Sandy Hook. He said he 
certainly had no previous intention 
to violate orders. It was something 
that just happened in his mind. A 
sort of mental sneeze. 

His squadron was approaching 

GALAXY 



78 




Rockaway, the flying creature 
about three miles ahead of him and 
half a mile down. He was aware of 
saying out loud to nobody: “Well, 
she’s too big.” Then he was darting 
out of formation, diving on her, giv- 
ing her one rocket-burst and reel- 
ing off to the south at 840 MPH. 

He never did locate or rejoin his 
squadron, but he made it somehow 
back to his home field. He climbed 
out of the cockpit, they say, and 
fell flat on his face. 

It seems likely that his shot 
missed the animal’s head and tore 
through some part of her left wing. 
She spun to the left, rose perhaps 
a thousand feet, facing the city, 
sideslipped, recovered herself and 
fought for altitude. She could not 
gain it. In the effort she collided 
with two of the following planes. 
One of them smashed into her right 
side behind the wing, the other 
flipped end over end across her 
back, like a swatted dragonfly. It 
dropped clear and made a mess on 
Bedloe’s Island. 

She too was falling, in a long 
slant, silent now but still living. 
After the impact her body thrashed 
desolately on the wreckage be- 
tween Lexington and Seventh 
Avenues, her right wing churning, 
then only trailing, in the East 
River, her left wing a crumpled 
slowly deflating mass concealing 
Times Square, Herald Square and 
the garment district. 

At the close of the struggle her 



neck extended, her turtle beak 
grasping the top of Radio City. She 
was still trying to pull herself up, 
as the buoyant gasses hissed and 
bubbled away through the gushing 
holes in her side. Radio City col- 
lapsed with her. 

For a long while after the roar 
of descending rubble and her own 
roaring had ceased, there was no 
human noise except a melancholy 
thunder of the planes. 

'T'HE apology came early next 
morning. 

The spaceship was observed to 
descend to the outer limits of at- 
mosphere, very briefly. A capsule 
was released, with a parachute 
timed to open at 40,000 feet and 
come down quite neatly in Scars- 
dale. Parachute, capsule and tim- 
ing device were of good workman- 
ship. 

The communication engraved 
on a plaque of metal (which still 
defies analysis) was a hasty job, 
the English slightly odd, with some 
evidence of an incomplete under- 
standing of the situation. That the 
visitors were themselves aware of 
these deficiencies is indicated by 
the text of the message itself. 

Most sadly regret inexcusable 
escape of livestock. While pet- 
ting same, one of our children 
monkied (sp?) with airlock. Will 
not happen again. Regret also 
imperfect grasp of language, 
learned through what you term

FORECAST 

Never will we be counted among those who deplore the practice of 
waiting until all installments of a serial are on hand before going on a 
reading spree. But in the case of Galaxy serials, who do deplore — deplore, 
nothing; we think it's self-theft to read the synopsis of the first installment and 
then the whole second, as if something as rich and strong and sensitive as the 
installment in this issue could be more than dehydrated and packed into a 
skimpy carton of a synopsis. In other words, DRUNKARD'S WALK by Frederik 
Pohl consists of only two installments, as we promised our serials would be — 
but you're missing a lot if you are one of the aufothieves mentioned above. 

You know, having 196 pages to sprawl around in — more pages than 
any other magazine in this field, regardless of price, and now maybe you 
understand what looked like funny arithmetic at the time; we knew what our 
esteemed rivals were going to do, how much it would cost you per page, and 
how much less each page of Galaxy came to; we just didn't figure they would 
take so long to make the change. To get back to that interrupted thought, 
having 196 pages to sprawl around in, we put our fingers in our ears and 
leaped into a Forecast with an installment of a serial and two novelets. 

So — two more novelets are herewith predicted for the next issue: 

SORDMAN THE PROTECTOR by Tom Purdom, the story of the most 
powerful man in the world, who can make anybody do — anything. 

MIND PARTNER by Christopher Anvil, whose hero has plenty of reason 
to worry. Why is he being offered a reward that couldn't be bigger — to 
break up a dope ring that couldn't be tinier? 

Short stories, Willy Ley on HOW TO SLAY DRAGONS, and our usual 
unusual features. Be on hand, won't you?

T HIS issue’s column is once 
more devoted exclusively 
to questions from readers. 
This also applies to this opening 
section, which unfortunately can- 
not be credited to individual 
readers, for questions about rocket 
fuels were the most frequent item 
during the last few weeks. They 
ranged from the simple but pretty 
unanswerable “Please tell me 
what they put into solid fuels” to 
a rather long and confused letter 
from a lady in New Jersey who 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



81 




said all kinds of things that simply 
aren’t so. 

To begin with, she “knew” that 
the Russian successes in the space 
field were all due to the use of 
solid fuels, while our explosions at 
Cape Canaveral occurred because 
of liquid fuels. She then went on 
to say that this solid fuel was in- 
dubitably a German invention 
and that we could probably find 
about it if we read all the patents 
taken out by the German com- 
pany of I. G. Farbenindustrie — 
I may add that she misspelled the 
name. Since this situation is un- 
bearable, she was writing to her 
senator, and she urged me to write 
to the President, asking him to 
order our chemists to go ahead 
and invent a solid fuel. 

I don’t know what her senator 
said to all this, but I tried to 
straighten her out as best I could 
in a letter: namely, that the Rus- 
sian space rockets burn refined 
kerosene with liquid oxygen, as 
suggested by Konstantin Eduardo- 
vitch Ziolkovsky in 1903, and that 
they use solid-fuel rockets only, 
as far as is known, to boost their 
smaller high-altitude research 
rockets off the launching pad, but 
that these rockets, too, are liquid- 
fuel devices. 

I also wrote that our chemists 
probably learned all I. G. Farben 
patents by heart as a matter of 
routine — and that we do have 
several companies which are in 



the business of concocting solid 
rocket fuels — without requiring 
a special order from the President. 

T ESS confused letters dealt 
with the question of why solid 
fuels are “superior” — “They must 
be or else the armed forces would 
not specify that they want solid- 
fuel rockets from now on” — and 
just what is meant by the term 
“families of fuels.” 

Though I have touched on some 
of these questions in the past, it 
is necessary to go over the whole 
problem in a more systematic 
manner to explain what is really 
involved. 

What 99 per cent of the people 
who worry about the “secret” of 
solid fuels — Russian, German, 
Japanese, Yugoslav or what have 
you — do not seem to realize is 
that all rockets started as solid- 
fuel rockets. When the English 
fireworks maker of the 17th cen- 
tury or the naval architect of the 
18th century, or the German gun- 
nery master of the same period 
retired to his laboratory to make 
some rockets, he concocted a mix- 
ture of 60 per cent saltpeter, 25 
per cent charcoal and 15 per cent 
sulfur. The proportions varied by 
one or two per cent from case to 
case, and there were special trade 
secrets as to how the saltpeter 
should be refined, how to obtain 
pure sulfur, and which kind of 
wood to burn into charcoal. But

the recipe was the one just given. 
It worked. And it was the only 
recipe there was. 

In the language of modem 
rocket engineering, the men made 
a “mixed composite” which had a 
number of advantages. It was 
simple, the ingredients were not 
expensive, and it was reasonably 
safe to make. That the rockets had 
a tendency to deteriorate in stor- 
age was another problem. And 
that they could not be made very 
large was still another one. 

It was due to these two draw- 
backs of poor storability and 
restricted size that inventors 
scouted around for other possibili- 
ties. Hermann Ganswindt in Ger- 
many (around 1880) and -later 
Dr. Robert H. Goddard in the 
United States (1913 and follow- 
ing years) thought about the pos- 
sibility of a machinegun-like fir- 
ing mechanism, using solid-fuel 
cartridges. Ziolkovsky (1898 or 
1903, depending on whether you 
have the year of writing or the 
year of publication of his first 
treatise in mind) wondered about 
the possibility of using liquid fuels. 
Goddard (patent of 1914) and 
Hermann Oberth (publication of 
1923) followed suit. 

Goddard was the first to actu- 
ally experiment with liquid fuels. 
His first test-stand rim- took place 
on November 1, 1923, his first free 
flight on March 16, 1926. In both 
cases, gasoline and liquid oxygen 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



were used. The first liquid-fuel 
rocket in Europe rose on March 
14, 1931; it had been built by 
Johannes Winkler and used liquid 
methane (CH 4 ) and liquid oxy- 
gen. The first Russian liquid-fuel 
rocket (built by Blagonravov, 
fuels probably kerosene and liquid 
oxygen) rose sometime in 1932. 

Of course each of these flights 
had been preceded by test-stand 
runs, most of which took place in 
spring and early summer 1930. 

A T about the same time, an in- 
• J -"- ventor tried his hand on a 
liquid-fuel rocket motor in which 
the oxidizer was not liquid oxy- 
gen. He was Friedrich Wilhelm 
Sander who, sometime during 
1929, demonstrated a test-stand 
run with nitric acid as an oxidizer 
and an unnamed substance (prob- 
ably fuel oil) as the fuel proper. 

Sander’s accomplishments are 
a difficult job for the historian for 
a very simple reason. Friedrich 
Wilhelm Sander was one of the 
very few people who, at that time, 
were in the rocket business; he 
made his living manufacturing 
rockets for signaling purposes, 
line-throwing lifesaving rockets 
and so forth. They were all stilt 
based on the old blackpowder for- 
mula mentioned, but he tried to 
make new inventions in his field, 
preferably before any competitors 
would come up with the same idea. 
Sander, as he made perfectly clear 



83 



in a letter to me, was not inter- 
ested in furthering science. He 
wanted to enlarge his business. 

While this is understandable, it 
leaves a few gaps in the history 
of the whole. One cannot even ask 
him to tell what he did and when 
he did it, because he disappeared 
early in the Second World War 
(rumor has it that he was arrested 
by the Gestapo and put into a con- 
centration camp) and must be 
presumed dead. 

My reason for stressing this gap 
in our historical knowledge is that 
Sander may have been the first 
to experiment with a new solid 
fuel too. There is, as has to be ex- 
plained first, a “family” of solid 
rocket fuels which is called the 
“double-base powders.” Their 
original inventor is Alfred Nobel 
and the invention itself is based on 
the fact that guncotton and nitro- 
glycerin can be kneaded together 
into a jelly-like substance. This 
substance was, for many years, 
the most powerful explosive 
known and was sold under the 
name of “blasting gelatin” and 
half a dozen other trade names. 
Because each of the two ingredi- 
ents is an explosive itself, the 
term “double-base explosive” was 
natural. 

Later, Alfred Nobel developed 
this original “double-base” explo- 
sive into safer solid double-base 
powders which received trade 
names like “ballistite.” It goes 



without saying that the “ballistite” 
of today is not the “ballistite” that 
Alfred Nobel and his chemists put 
together. But the one is the off- 
spring of the other. In fact, most 
of the “smokeless powders” in rifle 
cartridges are offsprings of the 
double-base experiment too. 

What I don’t know is who was 
the first to try a double-base 
smokeless powder for rocket pro- 
pulsion. It is known that Nobel 
himself experimented with rockets 
on and off, but the scanty descrip- 
tions that exist stress that his 
rockets carried a payload of nitro- 
glycerin which produced a blind- 
ing flash even in daytime and a 
very sharp report that could be 
heard for several miles. Whether 
Nobel used his new substances for 
propulsion or whether he stuck to 
the old formula is something I 
would like to learn. 

G ODDARD, at the time of the 
First World War, did make 
laboratory experiments with 
smokeless powders (commercial 
types) in order to measure their 
exhaust velocities, but to the best 
of my knowledge he never pro- 
duced a smokeless-powder rocket 
charge of any duration. It is logi- 
cal that he didn’t, because he had 
his machinegun-type firing mecha- 
nism in mind. 

It is, therefore, very likely that 
Sander was the first to use double- 
base powders for rocket propul- 



84 



GALAXY 



sion (unless Nobel did), but he 
did not arrive at a commercial 
product. This being his goal, he 
did not talk about his experi- 
ments. I know about it only be- 
cause he once permitted Max 
Valier to watch a series of test- 
stand runs, and Valier told me 
about them — just a few months 
before his own death, when a 
liquid-fuel rocket motor blew up 
on him. 

Naturally Sander, though prob- 
ably the first, was not the only 
one to think of Nobel’s double- 
base powders for rocket propulsion. 
The British Military Establish- 
ment did. So did the Ordnance 
Corps of the U.S. Army. So did the 
WaffenpTuiamt (Weapons Re- 
search Office) of the German 
Army. And when the Second 
World War came, everybody blos- 
somed out sooner or later with 
double-base rockets, propelled by 
sticks of “cordite” or “ballistite.” 

Just as the old “mixed compos- 
ite” had a standard composition 
from which the individual manu- 
facturers did pot deviate much, the 
new double-base sticks also had 
a standard. Half of them was 
nitroglycerin, between 40 and 42 
per cent was guncotton, while the 
remainder were additives with 
special functions. Main additive 
was diethyl-diphenyl urea, which 
was a gelatinizer. Carbon black 
was another additive, after it had 
been found out that an optically 



opaque charge burned more reli- 
ably than a translucent one. 

Now the double-base charges 
were superior to the old black- 
powder in not deteriorating in 
storage — or at least much more 
slowly, for these things are rela- 
tive too — in being more power- 
ful and safer all around. But they 
still could not be very large. It was 
necessary, for the bigger types of 
war rockets, to put several “sticks” 
into the rocket. 

The breakthrough to what is 
claimed to be a theoretically un- 
limited size (personally I am still 
sitting back waiting to see whether 
limits of some kind will not show 
up) did not come until after the 
war. Of course secrecy still pre- 
vails here. But the secret seems to 
be mainly in the manufacturing 
process, not so much in the com- 
position. The composition, in fact, 
is familiar. 

There is a cast double-base type 
(40 per cent nitroglycerin, 40 per 
cent nitrocellulose, 20 per cent 
additives). There is a mixed com- 
posite with ammonium nitrate as 
the oxidizer. And there are several 
which are actually synthetic rub- 
ber, with an oxidizer kneaded in. 

So we do have solid fuels galore. 

YVfHAT prompted most of the 
** questions from readers were 
newspaper stories dealing with 
specific items as, for example, that 
the Army’s liquid-fuel Redstone 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



85 



rocket is to be replaced by the 
solid-fuel Pershing, and that the 
liquid-fuel Atlas and Titan are 
eventually to be replaced by the 
solid-fuel Minuteman. 

The Minuteman is to be a 
three-stage rocket with the war- 
head in the third stage. The third 
stage, used by itself, would be a 
200-mile rocket. The third stage 
on top of the second stage would 
be a 1500-mile rocket. All three 
stages together would add up to a 
5000-mile rocket. 

Well, newspaper readers ask 
somewhat belligerently, if they 
are going to replace both the Red- 
stone and the Atlas by solid-fuel 
rockets, doesn’t that prove solid 
fuels are better? 

The answer, and this is really 
the key to the whole discussion, is 
that it does not prove anything 
like that. The choice is not one of 
“superiority” as the layman thinks 
of the term, but one of superior 
convenience. 

A solid-fuel rocket is much like 
a cartridge : once it has been made, 
it can be used at almost any time. 
A liquid-fuel rocket is more com- 
parable to an airplane: it needs 
servicing, fueling and so forth. Na- 
turally, for military purposes, the 
simpler version is the better one 
— not because it is inherently 
“better” but because it is more con- 
venient in every respect. 

Actually the best solid fuels of 
today are still somewhat less pow- 



erful than the customary liquid 
fuels. This is admittedly a tran- 
sitory talking point, for next week 
the fuel chemists may come up 
with a solid which is somewhat 
more powerful than the liquids in 
use. And whether there really is 
no limit to the size of solid-fuel 
units is something that still has to 
be proved, whereas we know right 
now that there is no limit to the 
size of a liquid-fuel unit, provided 
you have the skill and experience 
to build it. 

The trend toward solids for mil- 
tary purposes is due to ease of 
handling and storage. But even 
this trend is not unanimous. 

Recently the Air Force made 
the interesting discovery that a 
certain solid-fuel missile has to be 
replaced by a liquid-fuel missile. 
It is a missile which is carried 
“externally” under the wings of a 
fighter or bomber. Carrying rock- 
ets and missiles externally is old, 
of course. It always worked fine 
and was expected to work fine for 
all time to come. 

But one point had been over- 
looked. If the plane which carries 
the missile cruises at 400 mph, 
there is no problem. If it cruises at 
supersonic speeds, one factor 
changes — the missile is heated 
up. Being heated changes the per- 
formance of a rocket charge, but 
especially of a solid-fuel charge. 
Liquids are far less sensitive in 
that respect, and for this reason a 



86 



GALAXY 



solid-fuel job is now being re- 
placed by a liquid-fuel device. 

And the liquid-fuel engineers 
have gone over to a counterattack 
with new liquid fuels which allow 
a missile to be fueled and then 
stored as a sealed unit, just like a 
solid-fuel missile. 

A SIDE from these special 
items, the military trend is in 
the direction of the solid-fuel mis- 
sile, essentially for reasons of con- 
venience. 

This being so, what can be said 
in favor of the liquids? 

Technological guessing is diffi- 
cult, but it seems likely that the 
liquids will continue to be some- 
what more powerful. If a new solid 
catches up with the current liquids 
in power, the new liquids will 
probably jump ahead again. 

The liquid-fuel units are much 
larger now, and are likely to stay 
ahead in this respect too. Every 
once in a while somebody in 
Washington makes a news item 
by declaring that missiles should 
be smaller, because the warheads 
are growing smaller without being 
diminished in power. Well, yes — 
if the warhead can be smaller, and 
the rocket can be smaller and 
therefore easier to handle, and 
possibly even cheaper, this is fine 
for military purposes. But for 
space activities, things have to 
grow bigger, and bigger, and then 
bigger some more. 



Finally, a solid-fuel charge will 
do what it has been designed to do, 
but nothing else. The thrust of a 
liquid-fuel rocket can be adjusted 
in various ways, and when it comes 
to maimed flight, that is what is 
needed. 

Being at the end of my answer 
to many different letters, I won- 
der whether I’ve made that an- 
swer clear. 

The point is that one type of 
fuel is not inherently and in all 
ways “better” than all others. A 
certain type of fuel, or even a spe- 
cific fuel, is likely to be better for 
a specific purpose. And as long as 
you have several sets of purposes, 
you’ll need several kinds of fuels. 

DECREASE OF GRAVITY 
WITH ALTITUDE 

T T is pretty well known to 
-*■ everybody by now that a satel- 
lite in orbit does not have any 
weight in the ordinary sense of 
the word. It does have — a point 
which apparently cannot be em- 
phasized often enough — mass 
and inertia, but it does not have 
any “weight.” Almost inevitably 
this brings up the question of what 
it would weigh at a certain alti- 
tude if it did have weight — if, 
say, it rested on top of a tower of 
that height. 

The general rule is, of course, 
the one given by Sir Isaac New- 
ton. If the force of gravity is a 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



87 



given amount one planetary 
radius from the center (which 
means at the surface of the 
planet), then it is one-quarter of 
that value at a distance of two 
radii from the center (or one radius 
from the surfact), one-ninth at a 
distance of three radii from the 
center, and so forth. 

But what would the weight be 
at lower altitudes? Well, at the 
surface, the gravitational accelera- 
tion of the planet Earth is 32.18 
feet per second squared. At a 
height of 3 miles this figure is still 
32.15 ft. p. sec. squared. At 5 miles 
it has reached the value of 32.0 
ft. p. sec. squared; at 25 miles it is 
still 31.8 ft. p. sec. squared. At 55 
miles it is down to 31.4 ft. p. sec. 
squared and at 125 miles to 30.2. 

But 125 miles is not a satellite 
altitude; an artificial satellite 
placed in an orbit 125 miles from 
the ground would not last very 
long. The lowest feasible satellite 
altitude would be around 250 
miles. The value for “g” at that 
altitude would still be 28.5 feet 
per second squared, only about 10 
per cent less than at the surface. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Recently, in a radio broadcast, 
a reference to “anti-radiation 
drugd’ was made. What are these 
drugs and how do they work? 

Robert S. Stanley 
Jacksonville, Florida 



Yes, there some drugs which do 
help the body to overcome radia- 
tion damage. The one on which 
most work has been done has the 
chemical name of S- (2-amino- 
ethyl) isothiuronium hydrobro- 
mide and the formula. 

NH 2

H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 SC

and even chemists refer to it by 
the shortened name of AET. What 
AET can do has been shown in an 
experiment with a group of mice. 
One-half of that group was not 
treated and subjected to 625 ro- 
entgens of radiation. Half of the 
untreated mice died within one 
month after radiation was applied. 
The other half of the original 
group was treated with AET and 
it took 1300 roentgens to kill off 
half of the treated mice. You 
might say that the resist to radia- 
tion was just about doubled. 

An important point to remem- 
ber is that AET is not a pill which 
will “cure” radiation damage. If 
such a pill is possible, we haven’t 
found it yet. The AET must be 
present in the body before the ex- 
posure to radiation occurs, for 
it is a protecting chemical. It can 
be injected into a vein or simply 
swallowed. The method of intro- 
ducing it into the body does not 
seem to make any difference. 

The fact that such a protecting 



88 



GALAXY 



chemical has been found makes it 
probable that others exist and can 
be made; presumably there will 
be some which are far superior to 
AET, The search for such other 
chemicals is somewhat handi- 
capped at the present moment by 
the fact that nobody knows how 
AET works. 

The majority opinion among 
the researchers has it that the 
harmful effects of radiation are 
caused indirectly, via a chemical 
detour. The radiation is believed 
to produce so-called “free radi- 
cals,” chemicals which are highly 
active and for this reason do not 
exist for any length of time since 
they quickly combine with what- 
ever is on hand. The “raw mate- 
rial” from which the free radicals 
in question are formed is the 
water of the body tissues, but 
some researchers feel that the 
presence of free oxygen increases 
the formation of free radicals. 
These researchers believe, there- 
fore, that a lowering of the oxy- 
gen content of the tissues will be 
a partial answer. 

Other researchers shoved the 
question of whether free oxygen 
plays such a role somewhat aside 
in saying that AET obviously acts 
as a trap for free radicals and 
makes them harmless, no matter 
how they were formed. The pro- 
tection of the living cell by AET 
molecules would consist of “using 
up” the free radicals before they 



can attack the “living compounds” 
of the cell. 

Still another group of research- 
ers point out that if this were the 
whole story, any chemical which 
“uses up” free radicals should be 
an “anti-radiation drug.” But quite 
a number of compounds are 
known that do use up free radi- 
cals, but that do not produce any 
radiation protection. These re- 
searchers think that the AET, 
modified by body chemistry, com- 
bines with the sensitive substances 
of the cell instead, forming sub- 
stances which free radicals can- 
not attack. These researchers 
think that the body gets rid of the 
free radicals through other reac- 
tions and that afterward the com- 
bination of modified AET and cell 
constituents somehow falls apart 
so that the living cell can resume 
its functions. 

Of course additional protective 
chemicals may be found even if it 
it not clear just how they work. 
But the search for such chemicals 
would be eased if it could be es- 
tablished just how they do, or 
should, work. 

Please tell me whether any man 
has yet reached an altitude oi 
more, than 100,000 feet and how 
different space would be from 
whatever altitude has been 
reached.

The highest flight mentioned in 
professional literature is one by 
the late Captain Iven C. Kincheloe 
who took the rocket-propelled re- 
search airplane X-2 to a height of 
126, 000 feet in August 1954 and 
landed it safely after what he de- 
scribed as an uneventful flight. 

Except for the air resistance ex- 
perienced by a fast-moving body, 
conditions at 126,000 feet do not 
differ noticeably from free-space 
conditions. At about 100,000 feet, 
99 per cent of the Earth’s atmos- 
phere is below the pilot; hence his 
cabin has to protect him as thor- 
oughly as the cabin of a spaceship 
would. 

One difference I can think of 
would be conditions of illumina- 
tion. The contrast between illu- 
minated objects and lightless back- 
ground should be more pro- 
nounced and the space pilot would 
suffer if his eyes were not pro- 
tected by light filters. This condi- 
tion, however, would prevail to a 
large extent at 126,000 feet too. 
It is not stressed in the report on 
the flight, presumably because the 
time at the peak was so short. 

A friend of mine says that ", mega- 
buck ” means a million dollars. Is 
this true? Please answer in your 
column. I don’t want to sign my 
name in case my friend was only 
joking. 

Friend, you could have signed 



your name, because “megabuck” 
does mean a million dollars. But 
that does not mean that the term 
“mega” meaijs “million.” The word 
is an adaptation of a number of 
new terms introduced by the Na- 
tional Bureau of Standards denot- 
ing large and small figures so that 
they can be (A) easily pronounced 
and (B) avoid the confusion which 
always attends large numbers be- 
cause the American method of 
naming large numbers unfortu- 
nately differs from the European 
system. For example, the figure 

1.000. 000.000 is usually called a 
billion in America; in Europe, it is 
called a milliard, and the figure 

1.000. 000.000.000 is named billion. 

Readers of this column may 

have noticed that I never use the 
word billion for this reason, but 
instead use 1000 million. Now the 
National Bureau of Standards has 
picked the terms “tera," “giga” 
and “mega” for large figures. The 
word “tera” comes from Greek 
terastios meaning “monstrous.” 
“Giga” is from Greek gigas which 
means either a giant or just 
“mighty.” “Mega” is from Greek 
megas, meaning “large.” The names 
denote: 

Tera — 1,000,000,000,000 (Eu- 
ropean billion or American tril- 
lion); Giga' = 1,000,000,000; 
Mega — 1,000,000. Then comes 
Kilo — 1000; Hecto — 100 and 
Deka — 10. 

Below the decimal point you

Mitli =0.001; Micro = 0.000,001 
(or 1 millionth) and, as new addi- 
tions, Nano — 0.000,000,001 and 
Pico = 0.000,000,000,001. 

Is there a substance called ga- 
dolinium”? If so, what is it and 
what is it used for? I tried to look 
it up in a book on chemistry which 
my father has, but I could not find 
it. I presume it is quite rare and 
not listed for that reason.

If your father's chemistry text 
is more than a dozen years old, 
gadolinium may not have rated a 
separate paragraph because it was 
then mostly a chemical curiosity. 
But you should haye found it in 
the periodical table of the elements. 
Gadolinium is element No. 64, one 
of the rare-earth elements, hence 
a metal. It is named in honor of 
Professor Johan Gadolin of the 
University of Abo in Finland. Ga- 
dolin, who died in 1852, discov- 
ered a substance he named “yttria” 
because it came from Ytterby in 
Sweden. Yttria later turned out to 
be a complex mixture of com- 
pounds of many of the rare-earth 
elements of which gadolinium is 
one. 

In spite of the name attached to 
the whole group, it is not particu- 
larly rare; it was just difficult to iso-

late. The pure metal looks about 
like silver. The use of gadolinium 
as moderator rods in atomic piles 
was discussed several years ago, 
but I can’t say whether it is actu- 
ally so used now, nor do I know of 
any other uses. 

THE HAIRS ON 
YOUR GIRL’S HEAD 

/ | NLY about a week has gone 
" by between the appearance 
of the February issue on the news- 
stands and the writing of this col- 
umn, so there is very little mail as 
yet about the problem of the girls 
in the same town with the same 
number of hairs on their heads. 

I have, in fact, exactly two pieces 
of mail, both of them postcards. 
One states that it could not pos- 
sibly be the case. The other re- 
marks philosophically that one 
should not deny that anything is 
possible, but that this certainly is 
not probable. 

Well, this is one of the cases 
where “common sense” and mathe- 
matics are at odds with each other, 
,and in these cases mathematics 
always wins. 

Let’s repeat the problem: the 
town has 220,000 inhabitants or 
more. Without going into frac- 
tional percentages of statistics, 
this means that 110,000 inhabi- 
tants are female. Subtracting 25 
per cent of that number as being 
female children, we get an adult 

91 



female population of 82,500. 

We’ll postulate (in the hope of 
being mistaken) that one of these 
women suffers from an extreme 
case of what dermatologists call 
alopecia totalis, which means in 
plain English she does not have 
a single hair on her head. The num- 
ber of her hairs therefore is zero. 
This is the one possible extreme. 
She can’t have any less. 

Now what is the maximum num- 
ber possible? How many hairs are 
there in a really luxuriant dense- 



jungle-type head of hair? The es- 
timates of the expert vary a little; 
the figure usually runs between 

50.000 and 60,000, though some 
are willing to concede 80,000 as 
the possible maximum. Hence the 
girls in that town can have between 
zero and 80,000 hairs on their 
heads. Since there are more than 

80.000 girls, not only one or two 
but several thousand will have the 
same number of hairs on their 
heads at a given moment.

By JACK SHARKEY 



Somebody had to get the human 
angle on this trip . but what 
was humane about sending me? 



Illustrated by WOOD 



M Y agent was the one who 
got me the job of going 
along to write up the first 
trip to Mars, He was always getting 
me things like that — appearances 
on TV shows, or mentions in writ- 
ers’ magazines. If he didn’t sell 
94 



much of my stuff, at least he sold 
me. ' 

“It’ll be the biggest break a 
writer ever got,” he told me, two 
days before blastoff. “Oh, sure 
there’ll be scientific reports on the 
trip, but the public doesn’t want 
GALAXY 



them; they want the human slant 
on things.” 

“But, Louie,” I said weakly, “I’ll 
probably be locked up for the 
whole trip. If there are fights or ac- 
cidents, they won’t tell me about 
them.” 

“Nonsense,” said Louie, sipping 
carefully at a paper cup of scald- 
ing coffee. “It’ll be just like the 
public going along vicariously. 
They’ll identify with you.” 

“But, Louie,” I said, wiping the 
dampness from my palms on the 
knees of my trousers as I sat there, 
“how’ll I go about it? A story? An 
article? A you-are-there type of re- 
port? What?” 

Louie shrugged. “So keep a 
diary. It’ll be more intimate, like.” 

“But what if nothing happens?” 
I insisted hopelessly. 

Louie smiled. “So you fake it.” 

I got up from the chair in his of- 
fice and stepped to the door. 
“That’s dishonest,” .1 pointed out. 

“Creative is the word,” Louie 
said. 

So I went on the first trip to 
Mars. And I kept a diary. This is 
it. And it is honest. Honest it is. 

October 1, 1960 
THEY PICKED the launching 
date from the March, 1959, New 
York Times, which stated that this 
was the most likely time for launch- 
ing. Trip time is supposed to take 
260 days (that’s one way), so 
we’re aimed toward where Mars 



will be (had better be, or else). 

There are five of us on board. A 
pilot, co-pilot, navigator and bio- 
chemist. And, of course, me. I’ve 
met all but the pilot (he’s very 
busy today), and they seem friend- 
ly enough. 

Dwight Kroger, the biochemist, 
is rather old to take the “rigors of 
the journey,” as he puts it, but the 
government had a choice between 
sending a green scientist who could 
stand the trip or an accomplished 
man who would probably not sur- 
vive, so they picked Kroger. We’ve 
blasted off, though, and he’s still 
with us. He looks a damn sight bet- 
ter than I feel. He’s kind of bald- 
ing, and very iron-gray-haired and 
skinny, but his skin is tan as an In- 
dian’s, and right now he’s telling 
jokes in the washroom with the co- 
pilot. 

Jones (that’s the co-pilot; I 
didn’t quite catch his first name) is 
scarlet-faced, barrel-chested and 
gives the general appearance of be- 
longing under the spreading chest- 
nut tree, not in a metal bullet fling- 
ing itself out into airless space. 
Come to think of it, who does be- 
long where we are? 

The navigator’s name is Lloyd 
Streeter, but I haven’t seen his face 
yet. He has a little cubicle behind 
the pilot’s compartment, with all 
kinds of maps and rulers and things. 
He keeps bent low Over a welded 
to the wall (they call it the bulk- 
head, for some reason or other)

THE DOPE ON MARS 



table, scratching away with a ball- 
point pen on the maps, and now 
and then calling numbers over a 
microphone to the pilot. His hair 
is red and curly, and he looks as 
though he’d be tall if he ever gets 
to stand up. There are freckles on 
the backs of his hands, so I think 
he’s probably got them on his face, 
too. So far, all he’s said is, “Scram, 
I’m busy.” 

Kroger tells me that the pilot’s 
name is Patrick Desmond, but that 
I can call him Pat when I get to 
know him better. So far, he’s still 
Captain Desmond to me. I haven’t 
the vaguest idea what he looks like. 
He was already on board when I 
got here, with my typewriter and 
ream of paper, so we didn’t meet. 

My compartment is small but 
clean. I mean clean now. It wasn’t 
during blastoff. The inertial gravi- 
ties didn’t bother me so much as 
the gyroscopic spin they put on the 
ship so we have a sort of artificial 
gravity to hold us against the 
curved floor. It’s that constant 
whirly feeling that gets me. I get 
sick on merry-go-rounds, too. 

They’re having pork for dinner 
today. Not me. 

October 2, 1960 
FEELING MUCH better today. 
Kroger gave me a box of Drama- 
mine pills. He says they’ll help my 
stomach. So far, so good. 

Lloyd came by, also. “You play 
chess?” he asked. 



“A little,” I admitted. 

“How about a game sometime?” 
“Sure,” I said. “Do you have a 
board?” 

He didn’t. 

Lloyd went away then, but the 
interview wasn’t wasted. I learned 
that he is tall and does have a 
freckled face. Maybe we can build 
a chessboard. With my paper and 
his ballpoint pen and ruler, it should 
be easy. Don’t know what we’ll use 
for pieces, though. 

Jones (I still haven’t learned his 
first name) has been up with the 
pilot all day. He passed my room 
on the way to the galley (the 
kitchen) for a cup of dark brown 
coffee (they like it thick) and told 
me that we were almost past the 
Moon. I asked to look, but he said 
not yet; the instrument panel is 
Top Secret. They’d have to cover 
it so I could look out the viewing 
screen, and they still need it for 
steering or something. 

I still haven’t met the pilot. 

October 3, 1960 
WELL, I’VE met the pilot. He is 
kind of squat, with a vulturish neck 
and close-set jet-black eyes that 
make him look rather mean, but he 
was pleasant enough, and said I 
could call him Pat. I still don’t 
know Jones’ first name, though Pat 
spoke to him, and it sounded like 
Flants. That can’t be right 

Also, I am one of the first five 
men in the history of the world to 
GALAXY

see the opposite side of the Moon, 
with a bluish blurred crescent be- 
yond it that Pat said was the Earth. 
The back of the Moon isn’t much 
different from the front. As to the 
space in front of the ship, well, it’s 
all black with white dots in it, and 
none of the dots move, except in a 
circle that Pat says is a “torque” 
result from the gyroscopic spin 
we’re in. Actually, he explained to 
me, the screen is supposed to keep 
the image of space locked into 
place no matter how much we spin. 
But there’s some kind of a “drag.” 
I told him I hoped it didn’t mean 
we’d land on Mars upside down. He 
just stared at me. 

I can’t say I was too impressed 
with that 16 x 19 view of outer 
space. It’s been done much better 
in the movies. There’s just no awe- 
someness to it, no sense of depth or 
immensity. It’s as impressive as a 
piece of velvet with salt sprinkled 
on it. 

Lloyd and I made a chessboard 
out of a carton. Right now we’re us- 
ing buttons for men. He’s one of 
these fast players who don’t stop 
and think out their moves. And so 
far I haven’t won a game. 

It looks like a long trip. 

October 4, 1960 
I WON a game. Lloyd mistook my 
queen-button for my bishop-button 
and left his king in jeopardy, and 
I checkmated him next move. He 
said chess was a waste of time 



and he had important work to do 
and he went away. 

I went to the galley for coffee 
and had a talk about moss with 
Kroger. He said there was a good 
chance of lichen on Mars, and I 
misunderstood and said, “A good 
chance of liking what on Mars?” 
and Kroger finished his coffee and 
went up front. 

When I got back to my compart- 
ment, Lloyd had taken away the 
chessboard and all his buttons. He 
told me later he needed it to back 
up a star map. 

Pat slept mostly all day in his 
compartment, and Jones sat and 
watched the screen revolve. There 
wasn’t much to do, so I wrote a 
poem, sort of. 

Mary, Mary, Quite contrary. 

How does your garden grow? 

With Martian rime, Venusian slime, 

And a radioactive hoe . 

I showed it to Kroger. He says 
it may prove to be environmentally 
accurate, but that I should stick to 
prose. 

October 5, 1960 
LEARNED JONES’ first name. 
He wrote something in the ship’s 
log, and I saw his signature. His 
name is Fleance, like in “Macbeth.” 
He prefers to be called Jones. Pat 
uses his first name as a gag. Some 
fun. 

And only 255 days to go. 



THE DOPE ON MARS 



97 




98 



GALAXY 





April 1, 1961 
I’VE SKIPPED over the last 177 
days or so, because there’s nothing 
much new. I brought some books 
with me on the trip, books that I’d 
always meant to read and never 
had the time. So now I know all 
about Vanity Fair, Pride and Prej- 
udice, War and Peace, Gone with 
the Wind, and Babbitt. 

They didn’t take as long as I 
thought they would, except for 
Vanity Fair. It must have been a 
riot when it first came out. I mean, 
all those sly digs at the aristocracy, 
with copious interpolations by Mr. 
Thackeray in case you didn’t get 
it when he’d pulled a particularly 
good gag. Some fun. 

And only 78 days to go. 

June 1, 1961 
ONLY 17 DAYS to go. I saw Mars 
on the screen today. It seems to be 
descending from overhead, but Pat 
says that that’s the “torque” doing 
it. Actually, it’s we who are com- 
ing in sideways. 

We’ve all grown beards, too. Pat 
said it was against regulations, but 
what the hell. We have a contest. 
Longest whiskers on landing gets a 
prize. 

I asked Pat what the prize was 
and he told me to go to hell. 

June 18, 1961 
MARS HAS the whole screen 
filled. Looks like Death Valley. No 
sign of canals, but Pat says that’s 

THE. DOPE ON MARS 



because of the dust storm down be- 
low. It’s nice to have a “down be- 
low” again. We’re going to land, so 
I have to go to my bunk. It’s all 
foam rubber, nylon braid supports 
and magnesium tubing. Might as 
well be cement for all the good it 
did me at takeoff. Earth seems aw- 
fully far away. 

June 19, 1961 
WELL, WE’RE DOWN. We have 
to wear gas masks with oxygen 
hook-ups. Kroger says the air is 
breathable, but thin, and it has too 
much dust in it to be any fun to 
inhale. He’s all for going out and 
looking for lichen, but Pat says he’s 
got to set up camp, then get instruc- 
tions from Earth. So we just have 
to wait. The air is very cold, but the 
Sun is hot as hell when it hits you. 
The sky is a blinding pink, or may- 
be more of a pale fuchsia. Kroger 
says it’s the dust. The sand under- 
foot is kind of rose-colored, and not 
really gritty. The particles are 
round and smooth. 

No lichen so far. Kroger says 
maybe in the canals, if there are 
any canals. Lloyd wants to play 
chess again. 

Jones won the beard contest. Pat 
gave him a cigar he’d smuggled on 
board (no smoking was allowed on 
the ship), and Jones threw it away. 
He doesn’t smoke. 

June 20, 1961 
GOT LOST TODAY. Pat told me 



99 



not to go too far from camp, so, 
when I took a stroll, I made sure 
every so often that I could still see 
the rocket behind me. Walked for 
maybe an hour; then the oxygen 
gauge got past the halfway mark, 
so I started back toward the rocket. 
After maybe ten steps, the rocket 
disappeared. One minute it was 
standing there, tall and silvery, the 
next instant it was gone. 

Turned on my radio pack and 
got hold of Pat. Told him what hap- 
pened, and he told Kroger. Kroger 
said I had been following a mirage, 
to step back a bit. I did, and I could 
see the ship again. Kroger said to 
try and walk toward where the ship 
seemed to be, even when it wasn’t 
in view, and meantime they’d come 
out after me in the jeep, following 
my footprints. 

Started walking back, and the 
ship vanished again. It reappeared, 
disappeared, but I kept going. Fi- 
nally saw the real ship, and Lloyd 
and Jones waving their arms at me. 
They were shouting through their 
masks, but I couldn’t hear them. 
The air is too thin to carry sound 
well. 

All at once, something gleamed 
in their hands, and they started 
shooting at me with their rifles. 
That’s when I heard the noise be- 
hind me. I was too scared to turn 
around, but finally Jones and Lloyd 
came running over, and I got up 
enough nerve to look. There was 
nothing there, but on the sand, 
100 



paralleling mine, were footprints. 
At least I think they were foot- 
prints. Twice as long as mine, and 
three times as wide, but kind of 
featureless because the sand’s loose 
and dry. They doubled back on 
themselves, spaced considerably 
farther apart. 

“What was it?” I asked Lloyd 
when he got to me. 

“Damned if I know,” he said. “It 
was red and scaly, and I think it 
had a tail. It was two heads taller 
than you.” He shuddered. “Ran off 
when we fired.” 

“Where,” said Jones, “are Pat and 
Kroger?” 

I didn’t know. I hadn’t seen 
them, nor the jeep, on my trip back. 
So we followed the wheel tracks for 
a while, and they veered off from 
my trail and followed another, very 
much like the one that had been 
paralleling mine when Jones and 
Lloyd had taken a shot at the scaly 
thing. 

“We’d better get them on the 
radio,” said Jones, turning back 
toward the ship. 

There wasn’t anything on the 
radio but static. 

Pat and Kroger haven’t come 
back yet, either. 

June 21, 1961 
WE’RE NOT alone here. More of 
the scaly things have come toward 
the camp, but a few rifle shots send 
them away. They hop like kanga- 
roos when they’re startled. Their 
GALAXY 



attitudes aren’t menacing, but their 
appearance is. And Jones says, 
“Who knows what’s ‘menacing’ in 
an alien?” 

We’re going to look for Kroger 
and Pat today. Jones says we’d bet- 
ter before another windstorm blows 
away the jeep tracks. Fortunately, 
the jeep has a leaky oil pan, so we 
always have the smears to follow, 
unless they get covered up, too. 
We’re taking extra oxygen, shells, 
and rifles. Food, too, of course. 
And we’re locking up the ship. 

IT’S LATER, now. We found the 
jeep, but no Kroger or Pat. Lots of 
those big tracks nearby. We’re tak- 
ing the jeep to follow the aliens’ 
tracks. There’s some moss around 
here, on reddish brown rocks that 
stick up through the sand, just on 
the shady side, though. Kroger 
must be happy to have found his 
lichen. 

The trail ended at the brink of 
a deep crevice in the ground. Seems 
to be an earthquake-type split in 
solid rock, with the sand sifting 
over this and the far edge like pink 
silk cataracts. The bottom is in the 
shade and can’t be seen. The crack 
seems to extend to our left and 
right as far as we can look. 

There looks like a trail down the 
inside of the crevice, but the Sun’s 
setting, so we’re waiting till tomor- 
row to go down. 

Going down was Jones’ idea, 
not mine. 

THE DOPE ON MARS 



June 22, 1961 
WELL, WE’RE at the bottom, and 
there’s water here, a shallow stream 
about thirty feet wide that runs 
along the center of the canal (we’ve 
decided we’re in a canal). No sign 
of Pat or Kroger yet, but the sand 
here is hard-packed and damp, and 
there are normal-size footprints 
mingled with the alien ones, sharp 
and clear. The aliens seem to have 
six or seven toes. It varies from 
print to print. And they’re barefoot, 
too, or else they have the damned- 
est-looking shoes in creation. 

The constant shower of sand 
near the cliff walls is annoying, but 
it’s sandless (shower-wise) near 
the stream, so we’re following the 
footprints along the bank. Also, the 
air’s better down here. Still thin, 
but not so bad as on the surface. 
We’re going without masks to save 
oxygen for the return trip (Jones 
assures me there’ll be a return 
trip), and the air’s only a little bit 
sandy, but handkerchiefs over nose 
and mouth solve this. 

We look like desperadoes, what 
with the rifles and covered faces. I 
said as much to Lloyd and he told 
me to shut up. Moss all over the 
cliff walls. Swell luck for Kroger. 

WE’VE FOUND Kroger and Pat, 
with the help of the aliens. Or may- 
be I should call them the Martians. 
Either way, it’s better than what 
Jones calls them. 

They took away our rifles and 

101 



brought us right to Kroger and Pat, 
without our even asking, Jones is 
mad at the way they got the rifles so 
easily. When we came upon them 
(a group of maybe ten, huddling 
behind a boulder in ambush), he 
fired, but the shots either bounced 
off their scales or stuck in their 
thick hides. Anyway, they took the 
rifles away and threw them into the 
stream, and picked us all up and 
took us into a hole in the cliff wall. 
The hole went on practically for- 
ever, but it didn’t get dark. Kroger 
tells me that there are phosphores- 
cent bacteria living in the mold on 
the walls. The air has a fresh-dug- 
grave smell, but it’s richer in oxy- 
gen than even at the stream. 

We’re in a small cave that is just 
off a bigger cave where lots of tun- 
nels come together. I can’t remem- 
ber which one we came in through, 
and neither can anyone else. Jones 
asked me what the hell I kept writ- 
ing in the diary for, did I want to 
make it a gift to' Martian archeolo- 
gists? But I said where there’s life 
there’s hope, and now he won’t talk 
to me. I congratulated Kroger on 
the lichen I’d seen, but he just said 
a short and unscientific word and 
went to sleep. 

There’s a Martian guarding the 
entrance to our cave. I don’t know 
what they intend to do with us. 
Feed us, I hope. So far, they’ve just 
left us here, and we’re out of rations. 

Kroger tried talking to the guard 
once, but he (or it) made a whis- 
102 



tling kind of sound and flashed a 
mouthful of teeth. Kroger says the 
teeth are in multiple rows, like a 
tigershark’s. I’d rather he hadn’t 
told me. 

June 23, 1961, 1 think 
WE’RE EITHER in a docket or a 
zoo. I can’t tell which. There’s a 
rather square platform surrounded 
on all four sides by running water, 
maybe twenty feet across, and 
we’re on it. Martians keep coming 
to the far edge of the water and 
looking at us and whistling at each 
other. A little Martian came near 
the edge of the water and a larger 
Martian whistled like crazy and 
dragged it away. 

“Water must be dangerous to 
them,” said Kroger. 

“We shoulda brought water pis- 
tols,” Jones muttered. 

Pat said maybe we can swim to 
safety. Kroger told Pat he was 
crazy, that the little island we’re on 
here underground is bordered by a 
fast river that goes into the planet 
We’d end up drowned in some grot- 
to in the heart of the planet, says 
Kroger. 

“What the hell,” says Pat, “it’s 
better than starving.” 

It is not 

June 24, 1961, probably 
I’M HUNGRY. So is everybody 
else. Right now I could eat a din- 
ner raw, in a centrifuge, and keep it 
down. A Martian threw a stone at 
GALAXY 



Jones today, and Jones threw one 
back at him and broke off a couple 
of scales. The Martian whistled 
furiously and went away. When the 
crowd thinned out, same as it did 
yesterday (must be some sort of 
sleeping cycle here), Kroger talked 
Lloyd into swimming across the 
river and getting the red scales. 
Lloyd started at the upstream part 
of the current, and was about a hun- 
dred yards below this underground 
island before he made the far side. 
Sure is a swift current. 

But he got the scales, walked 
very far upstream of us, and swam 
back with them. The stream sides 
are steep, like in a fjord, and we 
had to lift him out of the swirling 
cold water, with the scales gripped 
in his fist. Or what was left of the 
scales. They had melted down in 
the water and left his hand all 
sticky. 

Kroger took the gummy things, 
studied them in the uncertain light, 
then tasted them and grinned. 

The Martians are made of sugar. 

LATER, SAME DAY. Kroger 
said that the Martian metabolism 
must be like Terran (Earth-type) 
metabolism, only with no pancreas 
to make insulin. They store their 
energy on the outside of then- 
bodies, in the form of scales. He’s 
watched them more closely and 
seen that they have long rubbery 
tubes for tongues, and that they 
now and then suck up water from 
THE DOPE ON MARS 



the stream while they’re watching 
us, being careful not to get their lips 
(all sugar, of course) wet. He 
guesses that their “blood” must be 
almost pure water, and that it 
washes away (from the inside, of 
course) the sugar they need for 
energy. 

I asked him where the sugar 
came from, and he said probably 
their bodies isolated carbon from 
something (he thought it might be 
the moss) and combined it with 
the hydrogen and oxygen in the 
water (even I knew the formula for 
water) to make sugar, a common 
carbohydrate. 

Like plants, on Earth, he said. 
Except, instead of using special 
cells on leaves to form carbohy- 
drates with the help of sunpower, 
as Earth plants do in photosyn- 
thesis (Kroger spelled that word 
for me), they used the shape of the 
scales like prisms, to isolate the 
spectra (another Kroger word) 
necessary to form the sugar. 

“I don’t get it,” I said politely, 
when he’d finished his spiel. 

“Simple," he said, as though he 
were addressing me by name. 
“They have a twofold reason to fear 
water. One: by complete solvency 
in that medium, they lose all energy 
and die. Two: even partial sprin- 
kling alters the shape of the scales, 
and they are unable to use sunpow- 
er to form more sugar, and still die, 
if a bit slower.” 

“Oh,” I said, taking it down ver- 

103 



batim. “So now what do we do?” 
“We remove our boots,” said 
Kroger, sitting on the ground and 
doing so, “and then we cross this 
stream, fill the boots with water, 
and spray our way to freedom.” 
“Which tunnel do we take?” 
asked Pat, his eyes aglow at the 
thought of escape. 

Kroger shrugged. “We’ll have to 
chance taking any that seem to 
slope upward. In any event, we can 
always follow it back and start 
again.” 

“I dunno,” said Jones. “Remem- 
ber those teeth of theirs. They must 
be for biting something more sub- 
stantial than moss, Kroger.” 
“We’ll risk it,” said Pat. “It’s bet- 
ter to go down fighting than to die 
of starvation.” 

The hell it is. 

June 24, 1961, for sure 
THE MARTIANS have coal 
mines. That’s what they use those 
teeth for. We passed through one 
and surprised a lot of them chew- 
ing gritty hunks of anthracite out 
of the walls. They came running at 
us, whistling with those tubelike 
tongues, and drooling dry coal dust, 
but Pat swung one of his boots in 
an arc that splashed all over the 
ground in front of them, and they 
turned tail (literally) and clat- 
tered off down another tunnel, 
sounding like a locomotive whistle 
gone beserk. 

We made the surface in another 



hour, back in the canal, and were 
lucky enough to find our own trail 
to follow toward the place above 
which the jeep still waited. 

Jones got the rifles out of the 
stream (the Martians had probably 
thought they were beyond recovery 
there) and we found the jeep. It 
was nearly buried in sand, but we 
got it cleaned off and running, and 
got back to the ship quickly. First 
thing we did on arriving was to 
break out the stores and have a 
celebration feast just outside the 
door of the ship. 

It was pork again, and I got sick. 

June 25, 1961 
WE’RE GOING BACK Pat says 
that a week is all we were allowed 
to stay and that it’s urgent to re- 
turn and tell what we’ve learned 
about Mars (we know there are 
Martians, and they’re made of 
sugar). 

“Why,” I said, “can’t we just tell 
it on the radio?” 

“Because,” said Pat, “if we tell 
them now, by the time we get back 
we’ll be yesterday’s news. This way 
we may be lucky and get a parade." 

“Maybe even money,” said 
Kroger, whose mind wasn’t always 
on science. 

“But they’ll ask why we didn’t 
radio the info, sir,” said Jones un- 
easily. 

“The radio,” said Pat, nodding to 
Lloyd, “was unfortunately broken 
shortly after landing."

GALAXY 



Lloyd blinked, then nodded 
back and walked around the 
rocket. I heard a crunching sound 
and the shattering of glass, not un- 
like the noise made when one 
drives a rifle butt through a radio. 

Well, it’s time for takeoff. 

THIS TIME it wasn’t so bad. I 
thought I was getting my space-legs, 
but Pat says there’s less gravity on 
Mars, so escape velocity didn’t 
have to be so fast, hence a smoother 
(relatively) trip on our shock-ab- 
sorbing bunks. 

Lloyd wants to play chess again. 
I’ll be careful not to win this time. 
However, if I don’t win, maybe this 
time I’ll be the one to quit. 

Kroger is busy in his cramped 
lab space trying to classify the lit- 
tle moss he was able to gather, and 
Jones and Pat are up front watch- 
ing the white specks revolve on that 
black velvet again. 

Guess I’ll take a nap. 

June 26, 1961 
HELL’S BELLS. Kroger says 
there are two baby Martians loose 
on board ship. Pat told him he 
was nuts, but there are certain 
signs he’s right. Like the missing 
charcoal in the air-filtration-and- 
reclaiming (AFAR) system. And 
the water gauges are going down. 
But the clincher is those two sugar 
crystals Lloyd had grabbed up 
when we were in that zoo. They’re 
gone. 

THE DOPE ON MARS 



Pat has declared a state of emer- 
gency. Quick thinking, that’s Pat. 
Lloyd, before he remembered and 
turned scarlet, suggested we radio 
Earth for instructions. We can’t. 

Here we are, somewhere in a 
void headed for Earth, with enough 
air and water left for maybe three 
days — if the Martians don’t take 
any more. 

Kroger is thrilled that he is 
learning something, maybe, about 
Martian reproductive processes. 
When he told Pat, Pat put it to a 
vote whether or not to jettison 
Kroger through the airlock. How- 
ever, it was decided that respon- 
sibility was pretty well divided. 
Lloyd had gotten the crystals, 
Kroger had only studied them, and 
Jones had brought them aboard. 

So Kroger stays, but meanwhile 
the air is getting worse. Pat sug- 
gested Kroger put us all into a state 
of suspended animation till land- 
ing time, eight months away. Kro- 
ger said, “How?” 

June 27, 1961 
AIR IS FOUL and I’m very 
thirsty. Kroger says that at least— 
when the Martians get bigger — 
they’ll have to show themselves. 
Pat says what do we do then? We 
can’t afford the water we need to 
melt them down. Besides, the 
melted crystals might all turn into 
little Martians. 

Jones says he’ll go down spit- 
ting. 



105 



Pat says why not dismantle in- 
terior of rocket to find out where 
they’re holing up? Fine idea. 

How do you dismantle riveted 
metal plates? 

June 28, 1961 
THE AFAR SYSTEM is no more 
and the water gauges are still drop- 
ping. Kroger suggests baking bread, 
then slicing it, then toasting it till 
it turns to carbon, and we can use 
the carbon in the AFAR system. 

We’ll have to try it, I guess. 

THE MARTIANS ate the bread. 
Jones came forward to tell us die 
loaves were cooling, and when he 
got back they were gone. However, 
he did find a few of the red crystals 
on the galley deck (floor). They’re 
good-sized crystals, too. Which 
means so are the Martians. 

Kroger says the Martians must 
be intelligent, otherwise they 
couldn’t have guessed at the carbo- 
hydrates present in the bread after 
a lifelong diet of anthracite. Pat 
says let’s jettison Kroger. 

This time the vote went against 
Kroger, but he got a last-minute re- 
prieve by suggesting the crystals 
be pulverized and mixed with sul- 
phuric acid. He says this’ll produce 
carbon. 

I certainly hope so. 

So does Kroger. 

BRIEF REPRIEVE for us. The 
acid-sugar combination not only 
106 



produces carbon but water vapor, 
and the gauge has gone up a notch. 
That means that we have a quart 
of water in the tanks for drink- 
ing. However, the air’s a bit better, 
and we voted to let Kroger stay in- 
side the rocket. 

Meantime, we have to catch 
those Martians. 

June 29, 1961 
WORSE AND WORSE. Lloyd 
caught one of the Martians in the 
firing chamber. We had to flood 
the chamber with acid to subdue 
the creature, which carbonized 
nicely. So now we have plenty of 
air and water again, but besides 
having another Martian still on 
the loose, we now don’t have 
enough acid left in the fuel tanks 
to make a landing. 

Pat says at least our vector will 
carry us to Earth and we can die 
on our home planet, which is bet- 
ter than perishing in space. 

The hell it is. 

March 3, 1962 
EARTH IN SIGHT. The other 
Martian is still with us. He’s where 
we can’t get at him without blow- 
torches, but he can’t get at the car- 
bon in the AFAR system, either, 
which is a help. However, his tail 
is prehensile, and now and then it 
snakes out through an air duct and 
yanks food right off the table from 
under our noses. 

Kroger says watch out. We are 
GALAXY 



made of carbohydrates, too. Fd 
rather not have known. 

March 4, 1962 
EARTH FILLS the screen in the 
control room. Pat says if we’re 
lucky, he might be able to use the 
bit of fuel we have left to set us 
in a descending spiral into one of 
the oceans. The rocket is tighter 
than a submarine, he insists, and 
it will float till we’re rescued, if 
the plates don’t crack under the im- 
pact 

We all agreed to try it. Not that 
we thought it had a good chance of 
working, but none of us had a bet- 
ter idea. 

T GUESS you know the rest of 
the story, about how that de- 
stroyer spotted us and got us and 
my diary aboard, and towed the 
rocket to San Francisco. News of 
the “captured Martian” leaked out, 
and we all became nine-day won- 
ders until the dismantling of the 
rocket. 

Kroger says he must have dis- 
solved in the water, and wonders 
what that would do. There are 



about a thousand of those crystal- 
scales on a Martian. 

So last week we found out, when 
those red-scaled things began clam- 
bering out of the sea on every coas- 
tal region on Earth. Kroger tried 
to explain to me about salinity os- 
mosis and hydrostatic pressure and 
crystalline life, but in no time at all 
he lost me. 

The point is, bullets won’t stop 
these things, and wherever a crys- 
tal falls, a new Martian springs up 
in a few weeks. It looks like the 
five of us have abetted an invasion 
from Mars. 

Needless to say, we’re no longer 
heroes. 

I haven’t heard from Pat or 
Lloyd for a week. Jones was picked 
up attacking a candy factory yes- 
terday, and Kroger and I were al- 
lowed to sign on for the flight to 
Venus scheduled within the next 
few days — because of our experi- 
ence. 

Kroger says there’s only enough 
fuel for a one-way trip. I don’t care. 
I’ve always wanted to travel with 
the President.

THE DOPE ON MARS

TRANSSTAR 



T HE small group of Earth 
colonists stood on a hill, 
tense and expectant, as 
their leader advanced. He walked 
slowly away from the huddled mob 
holding up his gun. You could hear 
the mother weep.

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 

I stood at ease to one side, as 
was proper. I knew what would 
happen, because I was from Trans- 
star. We have been taught to un- 
derstand the inevitable. 

The child came running out of 
the woods. I noted that they were 

GALAXY 




A Transstar agent's duty was to observe, 
not to save lives. But sometimes his duty 
was — not to know where his duty stoppedl 



not the woods of Earth, though they 
were brown. Nor was the grass the 
grass of Earth, though it was green. 

The child cried, “Mother!” The 
leader raised his gun and shot it. 

Even though I understood that 
the child was no longer a “him” and 

TRANSSTAR 



had become an “it” since falling 
into the hands of the aliens, I felt 
a tremor underneath my condition- 
ing. In Transstar you are taught 
that the conditioning is a sheath, 
pliable but breakable; you do not 
put all faith in it. 

109 



Now the important thing was the 
reaction of the small group of Earth 
colonists. 

They had seen the heartbreak- 
ing inevitable. They knew with the 
logic of their minds that the boy 
had to die. On this planet there 
were two races, two kinds of life: 
the eaber and the Earthmen. The 
eaber would lure a child away if 
they could and see to its infection, 
returning it to the Earth colony. 

It was a good trick the first time 
or two, and for the love of its chil- 
dren three thousand lives had been 
lost, two starting colonies wiped 
out. This third colony had to suc- 
ceed. I suspected that was why 
Transstar sent me here. 

The leader turned sadly towards 
his colonists. A man advanced: “A 
burial! It is safe to bury!” 

“It is not safe to bury,” said the 
leader. 

The man raised his arm. The 
leader hesitated and lost both his 
leadership and his life, because the 
half-maddened parent shot him in 
the chest . 

"D ACKRILL came to my Trans- 
star ship. “You stood there,” 
he said, eyes accusing. “You sit here 
now. You let the eaber do these 
things to us — yet you’re from 
Transstar, representing the incred- 
ible power of the Sol system. 
Why?” 

“Transstar was formed to handle 
star-sized situations,” I replied. “So 



far this colony is meeting only the 
problems of a local situation.” 

“Local situation!” He laughed 
bitterly. “I’m the third mayor in 
three weeks.” 

“There’ll be no more children 
lost to the eaber,” I said. 

“That’s for certain-sure,” he said, 
“but Transstar might lose one of its 
representatives if it doesn’t help us 
in our fight against the eaber. Our 
colony , is sickened to watch you 
with your magnificent star-ship 
and your empire of power, stand- 
ing by while we suffer.” 

“I am sorry.” 

He raised his hands and stepped 
towards me, but an orange light 
hummed from the walls. He looked 
surprised. He dropped his hands. 

“Now that you’ve properly 
cursed me, tell me the real reason 
for your visit, Mr. Mayor,” I said, 
flicking the protective button off. 

He eased into his chair wearily. 
It was a great planet to take the 
starch out of the leaders. 

“We had a visit from the eaber.” 
He went on talking eagerly. The 
eaber had picked this planet, Point 
Everready, as an advance planet- 
city for their own culture. They 
would kill the Earth colony if it 
didn’t leave. Rackril had told them 
about Transstar, about me. That I 
represented the total war capacity 
of the solar system. That I was in 
instantaneous touch with Trans- 
star Prime, near Mars, and that 
behind me stood a million space 



110 



GALAXY 



ships and countless prime fighting 
men, with weapons of power and 
vigor that could pulverize the 
eaber to dust. That I was there to 
see that the Earth colony survived, 
“This is only partly true,” I said. 
“I afn here to see whether an Earth 
colony can survive.” 

Anyway, Rackril had gotten the 
eaber stirred up. They were com- 
ing to see me. Okay? 

“I am Transstar,” I said. “I can 
only observe, not interfere.” 

He got mad again, but there was 
really no more to say. He left, go- 
ing from the marvelous machinery 
of my ship back to the crudeness of 
the village. I felt sorry for him and 
his people and wished I could re- 
assure him. 

I could not. 

Yet somewhere back at Trans- 
star Prime there was more than or- 
dinary interest in Point Everready. 
I wondered, as every Transstar 
agent must, how far Transstar 
would go on this project. Few 
Transstar men have ordered Con- 
dition Prime Total Red. Condition 
Prime Total Red is the complete 
amassing and release of our total 
war-making capacity directed at 
one enemy in one place at one time. 
You don’t get a CPTR more than 
once in decades; men in Trans- 
star have served a lifetime and 
never directed one. 

This is good, because CPTR is 
devastating in cost, machines and 
men. It is the most jealously 



guarded prerogative of the Trans- 
star system, which is in itself mere- 
ly a check-and-report to keep track 
of all Earth colonies spread out 
among the stars. 

T LOOKED at my condition 
-*■ panel. It glowed an off-white 
on the neat star-ship wall. Condi- 
tion white, nothing unusual; the 
same color I had stared at for five 
years as a full agent and fifteen 
years before that as both associate 
and assistant, learning the Trans- 
star operation. 

I thought about the dead boy, 
sleeping now on the grasses of 
Everready, as I made my daily re- 
port, pricking a card with three 
simple marks, feeding it to the 
transmitter which reported back to 
Prime. It seemed unfair, even with 
all my years of Transstar condi- 
tioning, that a boy would only de- 
serve three pinpricks in a daily 
report. The human race had not 
been standing behind him. 

It probably would not stand be- 
hind this colony. 

For that matter, though I had 
the safety of this rather expensive 
star-ship, the human race would 
probably not stand behind me, if 
the eaber turned out to be tough 
aliens. Many an agent has died in 
local or regional situations. 

I drank a cup of tea, but the 
warm drink didn’t help. Somehow 
these last years I had become more 
emotional. It was hard to be a 



TRANSSTAR 



111 



Transstar agent — for, by the time 
you learned how, you were too 
knowing in the ways of space to 
keep that prep school enthusiasm. 
I remembered the men who had 
lived and the men who had died 
as I drank my tea and felt sad. 

Towards midnight the colonists 
sent scout ships up, as ordered by 
Rackril. They were met by an 
equal number of eaber scout ships. 

The patrol fight was dull, with 
drones being chopped off by both 
sides. Nothing decisive. The eaber 
were good. I wondered if they also 
had a Transstar somewhere back 
at their home planet, a totality of 
force that might match Condition 
Prime Total Red, and result in a 
stand-off fight. This had never hap- 
pened in history. Someday we 
might even find somebody better 
than CPTR. 

At that instant expansion to the 
stars would stop, I knew. 

Whatever I thought about the 
eaber at long distance, I’d have a 
chance to learn more. A couple of 
them were now approaching my 
ship. 

They were sentient life. They 
were neither monsters nor particu- 
larly Earthlike. It was this balance 
of like-unlike that gave me the be- 
ginnings of a shudder under my 
conditioning. 

The reddish one advanced into 
my cabin. “Euben,” he said. He 
made a motion of turning with his 
hands, tapered fingers spread. A 



surge of sickness tickled in me, 
rushed up to a nerve agony. I just 
had time to relax and let the rap- 
ing power of his ray, or whatever 
it was, knock me out into a wel- 
come darkness. A non-conditioned 
man would have screamed and 
writhed on the floor, fighting the 
overpowering darkness. I rushed 
with it, gave in to it. 

"D RESENTLY there was a gen- 
-*■ tie bird-twitter. I sat up; Eu- 
ben’s power turned off. He laughed 
down at me. 

“Some Earth-power, some poten- 
cy,” he said, gesturing at my con- 
trol panel. I had, indeed, pushed 
my orange safety button, which 
should have frozen him immobile 
as it had Rackril. It had no effect 
on him or his friend. 

I tried to get up, but was as 
weak and shaking as an old man. 
So I sat there. 

“You are the protector to the 
Earthians,” he said. 

“No, Euben. I am merely here 
to observe.” 

“You’ll observe them made ex- 
tinct, Watcher,” he said. “This is the 
perimeter of eaber. We want this 
planet ourselves.” 

“That remains to be seen,” I said, 
finally rising stiffly and plopping 
into my chair. I turned off the use- 
less orange button. 

Euben roamed his eyes around 
the ship. “Better than your colony 
has. You are special.” 



112 



GALAXY 



“I am special,” I said. 

“They say you represent great 
power,” he said. 

“That is true.” 

“We have waited a long time to 
see this power,” said Euben. “We 
have exterminated two of your col- 
onies, and have not seen it.” 

“If this is all of eaber, it isn’t very 
large,” I said. “This planet could 
hardly hold a hundred thousand.” 
“I said we were perimeter. Be- 
hind us, thousands of planets. Tril- 
lions of eaber. There is nothing like 
us in the universe.” 

“We’ve heard that before.” 

This time he brought up two 
hands, to begin his twirling. I re- 
acted with a hypnosis block, which 
shunted off all my natural functions 
fpr a micro-second (with the help 
of the plate I was standing on). The 
pain was much less. He merely 
brought me to my knees. 

“Ah, you are not totally feeble,” 
he said. “Still I make you bow to 
me with the twisting of my bare 
hands in the air.” 

“Yes. But Earthmen do not greet 
new races with tricks and talk like 
two small boys bragging about how 
tough their older brothers are,” I 
said. “I am not here to brag tough. 
I am here to observe.” 

“If you don’t like what you ob- 
serve?” 

“Perhaps we will do something 
about it. Perhaps not.” 

He threw back his head and 
laughed. “You will die, die, die,” 

TRANSSTAR 



he said. ‘Watch this.” He nudged 
the other eaber who stepped for- 
ward and brought something out of 
his robe. 

It was a boned, dehydrated hu- 
man. 

The thing — evidently a human 
survivor of an earlier colony — had 
the floppy, mindless manner of a 
puppy dog, mewling and whimper- 
ing on its long chain. Euben 
snapped his fingers. The former hu- 
man ki-yied and scampered back 
under its owner’s robe. 

“Cute,” said Euben. “De-skele- 
toned Earthmen bring a good price 
in the pet-shops of eaber, so you 
are not a total loss in the universe.” 

HERE came a sudden scream 
and convulsion from the eaber’s 
robe. The eaber jumped back. The 
tragic, deboned human fell to the 
floor dead, spending a thin, too- 
bright red ebb of blood. 

“Eh — how did you do that?” 
asked Euben, stepping back a little, 
“I am Transstar,” I said. “Cer- 
tain things we do not permit with 
our life-form. I urge you not to 
continue this practice.” 

“So—” said Euben toeing at the 
dead man. “And he was so cute, too. 
Ah, well. There are more out there.” 
I controlled my voice and did 
not look down. “Can you establish 
your need for this planet?” I asked. 

“Yes. We are eaber; that is 
enough anywhere in space.” 

I stepped to a wall chart and 

113 



made a gesture. “This planet also 
falls along our perimeter. We oc- 
cupy this space — so. We have well 
utilized the solar and alpha planet 
systems, and it is time that we 
move out once more. This planet 
is but one of a thousand Earth colo- 
nies moving out to new space.” 
Euben shook his head. ‘What a 
ridiculous civilization! All space in 
this arc is saber. We close the door, 
so—” 

He made a fast gesture with his 
hand that tore inside of me, like 
a hot knife, scraping the bottom of 
my lungs. I was pretty much rid- 
ing on my conditioning now. I was 
sickened, angry with Euben and 
his race. But it was slightly differ- 
ent from dealing with an Earth 
neighbor you dislike. Bravery and 
caution! Always bravery— and cau- 
tion. 

“So you block us here,” I said. 
“Perhaps we will go elsewhere for 
a hundred or a thousand years. It’s 
no use to fight over space. There 
are millions of planets.” 

“Do you truly believe so?” 
smiled Euben. “Naive! The eaber 
do not like unknown life-forms 
prowling the universe. We will 
come to solar and alpha, as you call 
them, and put you on a chain like 
that one dead on the floor.” 

‘We might resist that,” I said. 
“How?” said Euben, bringing a 
black box out from under his robe. 

I have had my share of black 
boxes in my Transstar years. Be- 



fore it was barely in sight, I had 
retreated to my all-purpose closet 
He laughed, peering at me through 
the observation window and tried 
the various rays and whatnot in 
his weapon. Nothing much hap- 
pened for a while — heat, radiation, 
gas, sonic vibrations, the standard 
stuff. Pretty soon I knew he could 
take me; but it would take him 
about three days. Fair enough. 

The eaber were tough, but not 
unbeatable — at least on what he 
had shown me. 

He put away his black box. I 
stepped through the door. Decon- 
tamination worked all right, but the 
heat-reducer was wheezing like an 
asthma victim in a grain field. 

“So. You are junior good,” said 
Euben. He turned and left the ship, 
whistling in a very Earthian way, 
not bothering to look back. 

The other eaber remained. I of- 
fered him a cup of tea, which he 
drank greedily. He had something 
that looked a little like a serpent’s 
tongue which he ran quickly over 
the control board panels. He sniff- 
tasted the instruments, the furnish- 
ings, the modest weapons and com- 
munications equipment I had. 
Then he stepped back. 

“You will not survive eaber,” he 
said. He left, not bothering to step 
over the deboned Earthman. 

I picked up the soft, cooling mass 
and set it on the TV cradle. I didn’t 
call through channels. I slapped the 
Transstar Central button and let 



114 



GALAXY 



them have a look at the creature 
on the plate. 

T JENNESSY was on the monitor 
at Transstar Prime, near 
Mars. He gasped. “That’s not 
good,” he said. “Just a minute.” 

I sank into the chair and made 
more tea with shaking hands. The 
screen above me lighted and I was 
staring at Twelve. Thirteen is as 
high as you get in Transstar. 
“You’ve bought it,” he said. “In 
your arc you have the only mind- 
contact with the eaber. Elsewhere 
they’ve only made patrol war,” 
“Anybody solved them?” I asked. 
“Yes and no,” said Twelve Jack- 
son slowly. “They can hit us with 
a freeze-burn system they’ve got. 
Explodes you. We can reach them 
with most of our conventionals, but 
they don’t die easily. Range and 
depth of their civilization, un- 
known.” 

I told him about their trillion — 
according to Euben. Then I asked, 
“Whaf s my condition?” 

Jackson hesitated and I saw his 
hands twiddle over his buttons. 
“Condition orange,” he said, taking 
me off white. Power reached 
through space. In seventy-five sec- 
onds I could feel the sudden, subtle 
shift in the ship’s power fields, as 
they built up. 

“Don't get excited,” he said. “I’ve 
got a dozen oranges on the board.” 
“What about the colony here?” 
I said. 



“A colony is a local situation,” 
said Jackson. “Unfortunately, if we 
squandered our life-power every- 
time a few colonists died, we’d still 
be confined to the moon. They 
colonize of their own free will.” 

I touched the dead Earthman. 

“Yeah,” he said. “Nobody knew 
about that. It’ll get your planet 
plenty of free space in the TV casts. 
We’ll get a blubbering from the 
League for Space Safety.” 

“It makes me want to blubber a 
little myself,” I said. 

Twelve Jackson gave me a long, 
hard look. “Stay Transstar or get 
out,” he said. 

I gave him the rest of my report- 
interview on the tape and tried to 
get some sleep. The eaber came 
over the colony about midnight 
and bombed it a little, and I 
groaned awake. 

It must have been a half-hour 
later that I heard a scratching on 
the ship’s window. It was Rackril, 
peering in at me. 

When I joined him in the soft 
spring night he was excited. 

“I’ve got something to show your 
high-falutin’ boys back at Mars,” he 
said. “A real something.” 

We went in silence to his head- 
quarters through the sweet night 
grasses of Everready. It was truly 
a planet of richness and beauty in 
a natural sense, and I thought again 
of the contrast of the poisoned boy 
and the monstrosities of human 
pets that the eaber had created un- 

115 



TRANSSTAR 



der this moon, in their eaber cities, 
on this fine world. 

My mood was shattered the in- 
stant we stepped into Rackril’s 
combination mayor’s home-admin- 
istration center. The Colony Cor- 
respondent had arrived. 

There are simply too many 
Earth colonies for the space news 
services to cover them all. So they 
assign a Colony Correspondent to 
cover the whole arc, and you al- 
ways find them where the most 
trouble is. 

r |'' HIS one was a woman. She was 
of the young, peppy breed of 
females that start out life as a tom- 
boy and remain in trouble all of 
their lives because they like to 
take chances. I was doubly dis- 
turbed. First because it meant that 
wildly distorted stories would soon 
be muddying things back in solar 
and alpha; second, because this 
cute lady reminded me of my own 
Alicia, who had been a Transstar 
agent along with me, back a seem- 
ing thousand years ago when I was 
merely a Four. She had the same 
snapping black eyes, the same 
statuesque figure, the same light- 
humored air. 

“Well, so Transstar is really 
here!” she said. “Hey, Chief, how 
about a Transstar quote?” 

“Young lady, I am not Chief,” I 
said drily. “My name is Webster, 
and I hold the Transstar rank of 
Seven, and you well know that all 

116 



Transstar quotes must come from 
Transstar Prime.” 

“Those fossilized, dehumanized 
old men on Mars,” she said. “Never 
mind. I’ll find my own stories.” 
“Not here you won’t,” said Rack- 
ril, with authority’s natural fear of 
the tapes. “It’s past midnight. Go to 
bed. Tomorrow my tape man will 
give you a tour.” 

She stuck out her tongue. “I’ve 
had the tour. They’re all alike, full 
of lies and grease, signifying noth- 
ing. Only thing I ever learned on 
an official tour was how to defend 
myself against the passes of the 
tape men.” 

But she allowed herself to be 
pushed out. I guess it was the near- 
tragic urgency of our manner. 

Rackril led me into an inner 
room. On the bed rested a woman, 
but there was a strangeness to her. 
She was ancient in her skin, yet 
something about her bones told you 
she was hardly thirty. Her flesh was 
blue-splotched, the eyes animal- 
bright. Rackril gestured at her; she 
whimpered and squirmed in her 
bed. 

I laid a hand on his arm. “The 
eaber can hypnotize and make a 
hand gesture that tears you apart 
inside,” I said. “Don’t hold up your 
hands in front of her.” 

“We got her story,” said Rackrill, 
low-voiced. “She’s been prisoner to 
the eaber for over a year. From 
Colony Two, I guess. The eaber 
used her for — breeding.” 



GALAXY 



He led me to a smaller cot, 
where a blanket covered a figure. 
For a fleeting second I didn’t want 
him to pull back the blanket. He 
pulled it back. 

The creature on the bed was 
dead, shot with a Colony bullet. 
You could tell that it was a boy 
about three feet long. There was 
Earthman in him and eaber. The 
head and arms were Earthian, the 
rest eaber. It was shocking to see 
the hard-muscled dwarf body un- 
der that placid, almost handsome 
head. 

“Barely five months,” whispered 
the hag on the bed. “Forced in- 
semination. Always the hands 
twisting — always the pain.” 

“A friendly scientific experi- 
ment,” said Rackril. “They want 
drones for the slag jobs in their 
cities. Jobs eaber won’t do. They’ve 
produced a hundred or so of those 
idiots from captive women colo- 
nists. Force-fed and raised — this 
one is barely five months old, yet 
look at his size!” 

T SAID nothing, busy with tak- 
ing my tape, holding on to my 
objectivity through a force of will 
and my conditioning. 

Rackril opened the dead mouth. 
It was an exaggerated eaber 
tongue, black and reptile shaped. 
“No speech, therefore no intellect. 
Nor does it have mind speech like 
true eaber. It begs for food and does 
crude tasks to get it. I showed it to 



the men. One of them shot it. No- 
body blamed him. Tomorrow we’re 
going out and take these rats, and 
rescue those poor women that are 
still over there. Does your highness 
condescend to ask for a little 
Transstar help?” 

“Transstar won’t like this life- 
form meddling,” I said. ‘This is the 
second time.” 

Rackril slumped into a chair, 
looking at the woman who whis- 
pered some private incantation 
against the evils she had come to 
know. 

“I’ve got two thousand colonists, 
five hundred ships,” he said. “With 
or without your help, we’re going 
out tomorrow and take them.” 

“They’ve got a few more ships, 
Rackril.” 

He appeared not to hear. He sat 
there staring at the woman while 
I gathered up the eaber drone’s 
body to take back to my ship. 

“For God’s sake, get Transstar,” 
he said, as I left, and it was a 
prayer. 

Shortly before noon next day, 
Rackril was back at my ship. He 
pointed to the sky over the colony, 
where his small fighting ships were 
rising. “What did your bosses say?” 
he asked. 

“They said,” I replied, “that 
Transstar has to look after the safe- 
ty of the whole human race, and 
cannot match colonists man for 
man. There are safe places in alpha 
and solar to live — men are not ob- 



118 



GALAXY 



ligated to seek danger. However, 
they are disturbed about the drone. 
I am to give an official protest and 
warning to Euben the eaber, which 
I have done.” 

“Is that all!” 

I closed my eyes. “They also de- 
moted me one rank, from a Seven 
to a Six, for having left my ship un- 
attended in the middle of last night. 
During the time we examined the 
drone, a bumptious Colony Corres- 
pondent sneaked into my ship and 
taped an eaber monstrosity I had 
on the TV plate. She flung her sen- 
sationalism to the planets and na- 
tions of alpha and solar. To put it 
mildly, this has rocked the Galaxy, 
which is fine with our Colony Cor- 
respondent. She gets paid accord- 
ing to the number of TV stations 
that play her tape.” 

“The universe should know!” 
cried Rackril. 

“The universe has always 
known,” I said. “Every history book 
tells of worse things in almost every 
Middlesex village and town. Trans- 
star is not in show business, nor in 
policy-making. It observes and ob- 
jectively attends to the broad gen- 
eral welfare of the Earthian uni- 
verse.” 

Rackril’s voice was hoarse. “I 
have one empty ship,” he said bit- 
terly. “I lack a pilot. Will Transstar 
at least do me the favor of helping 
to fill that?” 

“It will,” I said, reaching for my 
combat slacks. 

TRANSSTAR 



HP HIS was a wild, foolish mission, 
and I knew it. But I wanted to 
get as close as I could to eaber- 
land, which I had only observed at 
a distance. And I wanted to do 
something about the affronts to my 
system. 

Sometimes it’s good to fire a kill- 
ing ray, even if it doesn’t mean 
much. 

We passed over three middle- 
sized eaber cities, the queerest 
cities I’d ever seen. 

“Practically all landing fields,” 
said a feminine voice in my ear. I 
looked to my left. The Colony Cor- 
respondent was riding a patrol ship 
on my right. I thanked her for 
achieving my embarrassment. 

“Oh, that’s all right, Doc,” she 
said. “You’re officialdom. Natural 
enemy. You’ll get in your licks.” 

“I’d rather take mine in kicks. 
And I know where I’d like to plant 
my foot,” I said. 

I got a brash laugh. Foolish girl! 
Women do not have to be aggres- 
sive. There’s the kind that make 
a fetish of rushing in where brave 
men hesitate. On their maimed and 
dead persons, the news tapes fat- 
ten and flourish. 

Rackril’s group thought they 
were fighting the battle of the eon. 
They were trying to land at the 
most advanced city where the cap- 
tive Earthwomen were thought to 
be. The action was good. I was 
gloriously bashed around and man- 
aged to shoot down my eaber ship. 

119 



It wasn’t a difficult action for a 
Transstar-trained man. I was more 
interested in observing that the 
eaber had out an equal patrol of 
five hundred to oppose us. But, with 
all the noise and banging that a 
thousand-ship fight makes, I could 
observe that there were easily ten 
or fifteen thousand more eaber 
military ships on the ground we 
ranged over. 

So the cities were not colonies. 
They were military bases for a 
large operation. 

More interesting than the ships 
at hand were the extremely large 
areas being cleared and laid out 
for additional ship concentrations. 
I estimated that they could even- 
tually base over a hundred thou- 
sand ships. 

That would interest Transstar 
immensely. 

Rackrill broke off the action 
when he had a mere hundred ships 
left. We limped back to the colony 
without being able to land in eaber 
territory. In fact, I doubted if the 
eaber chiefs regarded this as more 
than a quiet afternoon’s patrol ac- 
tion. With their layout I couldn’t 
blame them. 

We almost missed the colony 
and had to sweep back once more. 
Yes, there was my Transstar ship, 
glowing orangely on the ground. 
But what a changed ground! It was 
brown and bare, a desert as far as 
the horizon. 

During Rackril’s attack a secret 



eaber counter-attack had swept the 
colony’s transport ships, its build- 
ings, and Rackril’s fifteen hundred 
colonists into oblivion. 

TN times of shock men do drastic 
— or foolish — things. Rackril’s 
group of survivors began to bring 
down the cooking equipment and 
bedding from their ships, preparing 
a camp for the night on the blighted 
cemetery of their colony, dazed 
and tearful. 

“Ada, Ada,” Rackril moaned 
softly, his thick fingers picking at 
a gleaming aluminum pot. “Ada 
gone, Johnny gone—” 

I noticed that Martha Stoner, 
the tape-girl, had at last lost some 
of her high gloss. She stared at the 
scene, stunned. I could almost cali- 
brate the change in her, from a 
high-spirited girl to a shocked and 
understanding woman. 

I couldn’t hold back comment. 
“Now you see the frontier,” I said 
to her. “Now you’ve got a real tape 
that all the stations can use.” She 
shook her head dumbly. “Go home, 
Rackril,” I advised the benumbed 
leader. “Take your men and go 
home.” 

He turned on me with teeth 
bared and lip trembling. “You — 
and that Transstar fraud. You let 
this happen! Tell your piddling but- 
ton-pushers we will never go 
home!” 

The words rang bravely on the 
scorched ground, while an eaber 



120 



GALAXY 



patrol, high up, gently wafted over 
us on an observation mission. 

I shook my head. “At least go off 
in the forest where you have some 
protection — and some wood for 
your fires!” 

I turned to go. A clod of soil 
struck my back, then a small stone. 

“Go, Transstar filth, go!” They 
were all picking up the chant now. 

“I’ll file a tape all right!” cried 
Martha. “I can still get through to 
the world. The people will act, even 
if Transstar won’t.” 

I didn’t want to run. 

I swear, this was my worst mo- 
ment, because I had seen this dis- 
tress many times. I understood 
their monumental shock. But if I 
did not run I could be seriously 
disabled by their attack. At any 
moment one might pull a gun. My 
job was to remain in good health so 
I could observe. 

So I ran towards my ship. 

They followed in a ragged com- 
pany, shouting, cursing and at last 
pulling guns. I barely escaped into 
the orange-hued safety of the 
Transstar ship before the rays flew. 
The colonists danced and pranced 
around the ship, shooting at it and 
beating on it, like nothing so much 
as forest natives attacking an in- 
terloper. I understood and discreet- 
ly closed the portholes. 

“Order them home,” I begged 
Twelve Jackson. “They are 
doomed here.” 

“We don’t have the power,” said 



Jackson. ‘We can only help them 
home if they want to go.” 

I rang up Euben on the eaber 
channel which I used for official 
communications — so far, mostly 
for protests. Euben made his inno- 
cent, bird-twitter laugh. “Thank 
you for your protest about the colo- 
ny extinction,” he said. “This keeps 
my clerks busy. Your colony may 
leave at any time. In fact, I recom- 
mend this. We will need all the 
space on this planet very soon.” 

HREE days passed. 

I found the remnant of Rack- 
ril’s tattered colony in a sort of 
forest stockade. They were stiff 
with me, embarrassed about the 
stoning incident. They were ghost 
men, and a few women, going 
through the motions of building 
crude houses and planting their 
food. 

Martha was an exception, 
“They will stay,” she said proud- 
ly, her eyes glowing. “They will be 
buttressed by the great crusade our 
space tapes have started. First the 
story of the miserable pet-human, 
then the eaber drone thing, then 
the mass attack on the unguarded 
colony. Back home men are leav- 
ing their jobs, pouring their sav- 
ings into fighting ships. Institutions 
are subscribing money. Govern- 
ments are amassing new fighters. 
We’ve got the backing of all the 
thinking men in solar and alpha!” 
“It is too late in civilization for 




TRANSSTAR 



121 



an emotion-powered, unorganized 
mass movement to succeed,” I said. 
“Only Transstar is properly 
equipped for space war.” 

“Even Transstar men are quit- 
ting to join us!” she cried. 

“Possibly a few at the lower lev- 
els. Not the agents.” 

“No — not the dehumanized 
agents! Nor the feeble old men of 
Transstar Prime who stole their 
power from the governments of 
men, who drool over buttons they 
never dare push!” 

“The eaber do this to provoke 
us,” I said, “to show our power at 
their command, at their site of bat- 
tle, at a time they control. That’s 
why Transstar Prime won’t be 
sucked into the trap.” 

“They want to fight us. The time 
is now!” she said. 

“The time is not yet,” I said. 

I went back to my lonely ship, 
haunted by the faces of Rackril and 
his men as they glowed on my re- 
port tapes. I hunted the news 
broadcasts of solar and alpha and 
watched the revulsion and convul- 
sion of men back home — the enor- 
mous waste of the emotional jag. 
I saw ships starting from Earth to 
reach us, ill-prepared even to reach 
the moon, hurling across space 
vastnesses to become derelicts. I 
saw men throwing their pocket 
money at passing paraders of the 
anti-eaber crusade, normal ship- 
ping woefully hampered by the 
ridiculous items being sent to 



Rackril’s defenders. Government 
leaders, sensing the temper of the 
voters, threw their weight at Trans- 
star Prime, calling for action. They 
got nowhere. Transstar resists tem- 
porary popular politics just as it 
does local situations. 

“You certainly can’t call this a 
local situation!” I told Twelve 
Jackson. 

He sighed. “No, not any more. 
But the principle is missing. Every- 
body’s mad, but the eaber haven’t 
yet posed a major threat to the 
human race.” 

“They’ve got a couple hundred 
thousand fighting ships at our per- 
imeter,” I said. 

“They haven’t invaded territory 
we call our own. All the fighting is 
in no-man’s land. We’re trained to 
determine a real danger from a 
false one, and so far they don’t 
seem to be a real danger.” 

“It can get late fast,” I said. 

“Are you ready to ask for Con- 
dition Prime Total Red?” 

There was a silence while I tried 
to separate my sympathetic feel- 
ings from the intelligence of the 
military situation. “No, sir,” I said. 

“Thirteen Mayberry agrees with 
you,” said the Twelve, looking over 
his shoulder, and then I saw the 
shadow of a sleeve of the top man. 
Transstar’s Prime Prime, as the 
agents half-jokingly called him. 

At least the desiccated old men 
near Mars were getting more in- 
terested. 



122 



GALAXY 



<f~|N the day the first Earth-cru- 
sade task force arrived, both 
Martha and Rackril came to the 
ship. 

“You know it’s the end of Trans- 
star,” Martha told me. She was 
more subdued and serious, but she 
still had the high-school glow of 
mysticism in her eyes. “The people 
have been sold out for the last 
time.” 

“No one’s been sold out,” I said. 
“We are in a painful contact with 
a race that is both powerful and 
primitive. They can’t be reasoned 
with, yet we can’t blow them up 
until, at least, they give evidence 
that they intend to blow us up. So 
far it’s only a border incident, as 
they used to be called in one-world 
days.” 

“We aren’t waiting,” said Mar- 
tha. “Five thousand ships! The first 
wave of the ariti-eaber crusade will 
attack soon.” 

Martha put me so much in mind 
of Alicia — the way she held her 
head, the way she moved her hands. 
Once both Alicia and I had been 
at a point of resigning from Trans- 
star and leading normal lives. But 
something in the blood and bone 
had made our marriage to Trans- 
star stronger — until she was killed 
on a mission, and it was forever 
too late for me to quit I was aware 
that I was too loyal to the organiza- 
tion, which was, after all, merely 
another society of men. 

Yet, right now, I found myself 



questioning Prime’s judgment. 

Certainly they could have given 
me power to negotiate for the colo- 
ny with Euben. Certainly there 
were some potent weapons, short 
of total war, which we could have 
used on these vain primitives as 
easily as the ones they used on 
us. Nor need I have been brought 
to my knees in front of Euben. 

Yet my orders were to observe 
— report — take no action. 

We went aloft to watch the 
Earthmen’s attack. Both Martha 
and Rackril were set for an initial 
penetration to the first eaber city. 
As the massive fleet from Earth 
wheeled in from space and went 
directly to the attack, they cheered 
like students in a rooting section. 
I cautioned them that five thou- 
sand ships, strained from a long 
flight from alpha, could hardly up- 
set the eaber. 

“It’s only the first group!” cried 
Martha. “This is only the glorious 
beginning!” 

The eaber took no chances. They 
lofted fifteen thousand ships and 
pulled the Earthmen into a box. 

It took them about four hours to 
defeat the Earth attack. When the 
four hours passed, only about three 
hundred of the Earth fleet re- 
mained to sink to the oblivion of 
Rackril’s colony and lick their 
wounds. 

“No matter,” said Martha as we 
landed. “There will be more tomor- 
row and the day after that and af- 

123 



TRANSSTAR 



ter that. We’ll blacken the skies 
with ships.” 

But she went quickly, avoiding 
my eyes. 

“You’ll always have sanctuary 
on my ship,” I told Rackril as he 
went. 

“Your ship!” he snorted. “After 
today I’d rather trust my own 
stockade when Euben comes 
around. Incidentally, he has been 
kidnapping my work parties. Tell 
him we don’t like that. Tell him 
we’ve been able to catch a few 
eaber, and when we do we cut them 
into four equal parts while they’re 
still alive.” 

“Please don’t,” I said. 

T^UBEN came along as I was 
having my evening tea. “Ah, 
my scholarly friend with the glasses 
and the tea-drinking, the big words 
and the scoldings. I must thank you 
for keeping at least a part of our 
fleet in practice. A rather nice 
patrol action today, Webster. Is 
that your Transstar?” 

“No. I ask you now what your in- 
tentions are as to this planet and 
our future relations,” I said, aware 
that Transstar Prime, through this 
ship, had been watching the long 
day’s affairs. 

Euben had brought his friend 
with him. They both lolled at their 
ease in my cabin. 

“It has been hard to determine,” 
said Euben. “We have finally de- 
cided that, rather than waste rays 



killing off all Earthmen, we shall 
simply turn them into eaber. An in- 
ferior eaber, but still eaber. We 
have taken a few samples from 
Rackril’s post as prototypes.” 

“This is forbidden!” I snapped. 

“You will declare war?” asked 
Euben eagerly. I thought his eager- 
ness had grown. 

“We don’t know whom we deal 
with,” I said. “You may be only a 
patrol captain, with a small com- 
mand.” 

“I could also be commander-in- 
chief of all the eaber in space,” said 
Euben. “Which I happen to be.” 

He said it too offhandedly to be 
a lie, although I suspected he was 
really deputy commander to the 
silent eaber who stood behind him. 

“Then I formally demand that 
you cease and desist all harass- 
ments, mutilations and hostilities 
against humans,” I said. 

Euben looked at me a long time. 
Then he held out what could rea- 
sonably be called an arm, which his 
companion grasped. 

My ship seemed to whirl about 
me. It was no such thing. Instead 
I was suspended upside down in 
the air over my desk, and Euben 
and the other left the ship, “Fare- 
well, brave-foolish,” called Euben 
mockingly. “Next time I come it is 
to collect you for eaberization!” 

His laugh was proud and full of 
confidence. 

When I finally managed to right 
myself and get back behind my 



124 



GALAXY 



desk, I called Transstar Prime and 
got Twelve Jackson. I feared I saw 
a flick of amusement in his eyes. 
“They are determined now for 
war,” I said. “How do we stand?” 

“You continue to observe,” said 
Jackson. “Point Everready is not 
necessary to Earth. And you have 
not convinced us that a battle needs 
to be fought.” 

7 had not convinced them. But 
what did I — a mere agent — have 
to do with it? 

I rang off and closed the ship, 
in sorrow and anger. I had been 
aloof from the situation, to the 
point where Euben had stood me 
on my head and threatened to cap- 
ture me bodily. 

I put on my combat slacks and 
broke out my weapons. Transstar 
could remain uninvolved, but I 
wasn’t going to sit at my desk, be 
stood on my ear and blithely be 
turned into an eaber all for the 
glory of the organization. 

I rode over to Rackril’s stockade 
full of cold purpose. 

I was no rugged-primitive colo- 
nist. I was a trained agent, with 
quite a few good weapons and con- 
siderable experience in hostilities, 
especially against alien life-forms. 
Euben would have no easy time 
taking me. 

I found Rackril in more trouble. 
“Look,” he fumed, pointing to a 
dead eaber at the wall of the stock- 
ade. “We shot this fellow. Look 
closely.” 



It was easy to see that it was 
one of his own colonists, upon 
which extensive biology had been 
used to turn him into something 
eaber-like. 

“It’s going to happen to us all,” 
shuddered Martha. “The crusade 
has collapsed. There’ll be no more 
Earth ships. Distances are too great 
— governments are too busy with 
their home affairs. We have been 
outlawed in all major planets.” 

I stared at the white-faced colo- 
nist leaders in distaste. 

“For God’s sake, quit sniveling 
and feeling sorry for yourselves,” I 
said. “We’re going to fight these 
beasts and do it right. First, I want 
an antenna. I can draw power from 
my ship that the eaber can’t crack. 
Second, I want to fight an eaber- 
type war. Get your colonists to- 
gether for indoctrination. These 
eaber have primitive mind-reading 
abilities; I want to start training 
our men to set up mind guards 
against that. Last, we’re going to 
dig some tunnels in this ground and 
blow the eaber into orbit. They 
don’t like things underground. 
They have no defense for it. So 
let’s get organized!” 

“Thank God!” cried Martha. 
“Transstar is coming in at last.” 
“No,” I said. “Just Charles Web- 
ster.” 

VjrTE fought the eaber for twen- 
” ty days. 

They couldn’t penetrate the 

125 



TRANSSTAR 



power wall I set up with the help 
of the ship, using Transstar power. 
They couldn’t waylay our work 
parties in the woods after I taught 
them how to use mind-blocks 
which were meaningless to the 
eaber. 

We got our tunnel through and 
blew up one third of an eaber city 
with one of my strontium 90 pills. 
We were also able to capture a few 
eaber patrol ships and send them 
right back, with fair-sized atomic 
blasts. The rest we manned and 
used against the eaber. They were 
totally confused with being at- 
tacked by their own ships. It wasn’t 
enough to destroy a twentieth of 
their operation. But it kept them 
busy. 

I was never once outside my 
combat slacks. 

I got little sleep. I lived for the 
present moment, working hand and 
shoulder with Raclcril’s men. When 
disaster came, it came all at once. 

I led a night patrol to place the 
next strontium 90 pill overland 
runnel me was too slow. I caught an 
eaber freeze-ray that shattered my 
leg. In the confusion we lost Mar- 
tha to the eaber, which I only 
learned when I’d been carried back 
to the stockade. 

When dawn broke, Rackril 
shook me out of a dazed sleep. 

“Look,” he said. 

“Ten thousand ships to destroy 
two dozen men,” I laughed. “It’s 
all right, Alicia.” 



Rackril slapped my face. “Better 
come out of it, Webster. Can we 
stand an attack like that?” 

I gulped a wake-up pill and 
brought myself alert. “No, we can- 
not. This is our day for extinction. 
Our only decision now is to pick 
the time and place of our going. 
Let’s get over to the Transstar ship 
as fast as possible.” 

“I’m not leaving Point Ever- 
ready,” growled Rackril. 

“Nor am I,” I said. “Let’s move, 
man.” 

It was a sticky hour getting back 
to my ship. By that time our stock- 
ade, power block and all, had been 
pulverized to dust behind us by the 
attacking weight of the eaber ships. 

“Take me up, Rackril,” I said 
as we reached the bottom of the 
ship. “I can’t climb any more.” 

He pointed up dumbly. The fox 
face of Euben and his eternal com- 
panion grinned down at us. I 
shifted out a gun and took off the 
safety. “Take me up, Rackril.” 

It was almost ceremonial as 
Rackril and the bare half-dozen 
who had made it through gathered 
about me in the cabin. I eased 
painfully into my chair. Euben saw 
my leg and grinned. “Looks like an 
amputation before we can make 
you a- useful eaber,” he said. 

My bullet skipped across his 
shoulder. “Stand over by that wall, 
you,” I said. "You, Euben! I’m talk- 
ing to you.” 

“You cannot order me,” he said,

but he moved back sprightlily 
enough. “I humor you, you see,” he 
said. “Your stockade is gone. You 
have nothing but this ship. I have 
decided to have it gently blasted 
into space as worthless junk.” 

He gestured out of the window, 
where his ships were making passes 
now. My Transstar ship shuddered. 
“We can bounce it off the planet 
like a harmless rubber ball,” he 
said. He gestured in back of me. “I 
have also returned your woman of 
whom you think so much. She is 
worthless to become an eaber.” 

T TURNED and saw the thin 
shape of what had once been 
Martha, huddled on my navigator’s 
bench. It was obvious that they had 
treated her roughly. From the 
trickle of blood at her mouth, she 
was badly hemorrhaged. She could 
not live. 

I stared down at her. It was hard 
to tell if she still recognized me. 
She opened her mouth slightly, and 
I saw the black familiar shape of 
the eaber reptile tongue. 

I turned away, light-headed with 
sorrow and anger. 

I jabbed a button and looked up 
at the tall TV. It wasn’t Twelve 
Jackson. It was Thirteen Mayber- 
ry, Mr. Prime himself. 

“What are you staring at, you 
old goat?” I cried, a little hysteri- 
cally. “Sore because I took action 
to save my own hide?” 

“No, you young fool. I was just 



wondering how long you’d permit 
this minor outrage to go on.” 

“It ends now!” I said. “Listen, 
Prime, I have Earth people here 
who demand sanctuary of Trans- 
star.” 

“You have it,” he said. “We will 
up that ship, son. No power in the 
universe will keep it on the 
ground.” 

“The eaber are upping it quite 
nicely, thanks,” I said. “But we 
don’t want it upped!” 

I had to stop talking while the 
thudding blows of the gentle eaber 
rays buffeted the ship. 

“Not upped?” asked Mayberry. 
“No, sir, not upped. We’re stay- 
ing! We hold the ground that this 
Transstar ship rests on, in the name 
of Earth. It isn’t much, only about 
fifty feet long and twenty-five wide, 
but it’s Earth territory. No race or 
force may deprive us of our real 
estate.” 

“You tell him!” cried Rackril. 

I turned to Euben. “Now, friend,” 
I said, “just ease this ship back to 
our ground. It’s Earth ground. We 
intend to hold it!” 

“Your leg-wound has made you 
mad,” said Euben, with a shrug. 
“We have decided that you are not 
even worthy to be eaber pets.” 
“Last warning, Euben! You’ve 
got yourself a Transstar situation.” 
Euben didn’t hesitate. 

He turned his hands in the air. 
I rolled in pain, but I kept seated. 
When I could see again from the 



TRANSSTAR 



127 



pain, I looked up. Mayberry and 
Jackson and Hennessy and the for- 
ty-one division commanders of 
Transstar were blazing from the 
wall. The TV looked like a Christ- 
mas tree. 

“Transstar orders this ship down, 
aijd that ground preserved in the 
name of Earth-alpha!” said May- 
berry shortly to Euben. 

Euben looked at the old man 
and shook his head. “Madmen,” he 
said. “I spit on you.” He spit on the 
screen at Mayberry. He had 
learned Earth insults well. 

“My condition is Prime Total 
Red,” I told Mayberry. 

He leaned forward and closed 
the seldom-closed circuit at Trans- 
star Prime. 

“Your condition is Prime Total 
Red, and your ship is now com- 
mand post for all Earth-alpha star 
power.” 

T LEANED over and tapped a 
•*- button. We left Point Ever- 
ready in a beautiful swoop that 
only a Transstar ship could per- 
form. I held us high in the atmo- 
sphere over the planet and looked 
sadly down. It had been a beautiful 
planet 

I hit another button and looked 
up at the forty-one division com- 
manders of Transstar. “Your or- 
ders are to destroy the eaber,” I 
said. 

I sat back. For a few seconds it 
was deathly silent, while Euben 

128 





sputtered and fussed about his 
quick ride up over the planet Then 
there was the faintest whisper of 
— something — back and out and 
behind us. 

“Brace yourselves, folks,” I told 
the Earthmen. “It’s going to be 
loud and crowded around here!” 

Euben jabbered at some kind of 
communicator he held in his hands. 
His partner likewise gabbled. 

“We have a hundred and fifty 
thousand ships,” he told me. “We’ll 
tear you to shreds!” 

I kicked a chair over at him. “Sit 
down. You’re going to want to sit 
in a minute.” 

“Something’s wrong with the 
ship!” cried Rackril. “It’s heavy 
and dead!” 

“We’re drawing most of the 
broadcast power this side of Mars,” 
I said. “In a minute you’ll be glad 
we have that protection!” 

Transstar came then. The fast 
patrols whisked out of black space 
and leaped into our atmosphere 
like gleaming fish that fired a rock- 
ing blast of weaponry and were 
gone to rendezvous, reform and 
pass again. They were like nothing 
the eaber had ever seen. They 
were made for a star-go like this, 
a burst of light, a dazzle and a thun- 
der that came and came and came. 
Behind them came the light 
patrols and then the medium 
patrols and then the heavy patrols 
and then the fast light shock 
ships and then the medium shock 



129 



ships and then the heavy shocks, 
wave upon wave, upon wave. 

Even wrapped in our thick blan- 
ket of power we were stunned. 

The planet came alight like a 
pearl below us. The air was 
jammed with sound shocks, the 
dazzle was like a spreading, thick- 
ening bomb of light that transfixed 
the eyeballs even through the dark 
screens I had set up. 

“This is early stuff,” I told Eu- 
ben conversationally. “They just 
do a little holding till the impor- 
tant ships arrive. Patrols and first 
shocks — the usual things, you 
know.” 

Euben’s mouth was open. He 
took time to swallow before he 
screamed orders to his ships below. 

The patrols and shocks were 
suddenly past firing range. For a 
moment you could see the planet 
through the haze. Its shore lines 
and rivers had sickened and wav- 
ered. The eaber ships, which had 
been a blanket, were a tattered rag. 

Hennessy, the headquarters 
jokester, couldn’t resist a com- 
ment that probably earned him a 
fine. “Here comes the Cavalry,” he 
said over the TV. 

And they came. 

TT was good professional stuff, 
geared to star action. Now we 
had the regulars. They came in 
waves of ten thousand, which was 
a wee bit impressive, I thought. 
There were the ground regulars, 



the medium regulars and the high 
regulars, each division with thirty 
categories, each category with its 
subdivisions of missiles, rockets and 
drones. The atmosphere screamed 
at us. The density of the light as- 
sumed sun proportions, and our 
poor little ship was like a chip on 
an angry ocean. Rackril had his 
mouth wide open. He was yelling 
to relieve his tension at the awe- 
some sight; the others were lost 
in the overwhelming cataclysm of 
it. I had seen it in movies. 

I poured myself a cup of tea. 

“These are just the on-call regu- 
lars,” I told Euben. “Of course, you 
realize that in a Prime Red we’re 
getting total mobilization. We’ll get 
slightly less than a million ships in 
the first hour. The rest will come 
later.” 

Euben had stopped shouting or- 
ders. He stared at me. He said 
something that I couldn’t hear. The 
pounding went on for fifteen min- 
utes; then the planet cleared. 
There weren’t any shore lines or 
rivers any more. There weren’t 
very many eaber ships. 

“Stop it,” he said. 

I shook my head. “Sorry. A 
Prime Red can’t be stopped easily. 
Once the momentum starts it has 
to run its course. Get set now. Here 
come your specials.” 

As the specials started to arrive, 
I taunted the Division Command- 
ers. “Transstar is getting rusty. 
You’ve hardly nicked the planet. 



130 



GALAXY 



Can’t your boys shoot properly any 
more?” 

They came in fat and sleek. Far 
off they waddled and wallowed, 
like a bunch of old ladies hitting a 
bargain counter. But suddenly they 
were serious, close up, and I had 
to close the portholes against the 
awesome roar and light of their 
work. You name the ray, bullet, 
bomb, gas — it was there. 

A half-hour later the din eased 
off and we looked. A large frag- 
ment of seared rock floated in 
space. The entire eaber fleet had 
long ago disappeared. So had 
everything else except that radio- 
active rock. 

The last wave was the massive 
attack unit, very slow and lumber- 
ing compared to the others, but 
packed with power. The first five 
thousand took eager bites of the 
rock — and there was nothing left 
for the other twenty-five thousand. 
There was nothing left at all of 
Point Everready except some haze 
hanging below us in space. But it 
was too late to stop the attack. 

To one side of us the returning 
waves began to streak by — the 
patrols, fast, light, medium and 
heavy, the shocks, first, second and 
third, the regulars in their stream- 
ing divisions and then the specials. 
Meanwhile, closer by, the second 
wave was coming in, first patrols 
and first shocks, darting a few shots 
to keep their hand in, at the float- 
ing dust patches. 



UBEN looked out and saw 
ships to his left and to his 
right and behind him and below 
him and above him and in all posi- 
tions in between. It was such a 
heavy concentration that the stars 
were blocked out and, though no 
atmosphere existed for a non-exist- 
ent planet, we were a planet of 
moving ships, ourselves creating a 
gravity and a stinking jet-flame 
atmosphere. It was a moving dream 
of hell, enough to make your mind 
crack open with the motion of it. 
It was the phantom action of a 
near-million star-ships — and an- 
other million on the way. 

This was the total war capacity 
delivered to order. 

What it cost in disruption and 
money and waste was incredible 
to contemplate. But that was 
Prime Total Red — everything we 
had. And it wasn’t at all pointless. 

“The eaber surrender,” said 
Euben. 

He stood respectfully now, his 
commander behind him. I guess he 
was thinking of the remaining eaber 
colonies on other planets, as there 
was nothing left to surrender here. 

I handed him a rag. “You may 
now wipe the spit off my TV plate 
receiver,” I said. He did it with 
alacrity. 

“We will go elsewhere,” said 
Euben’s companion. “After all, 
space is big. There is plenty of 
room for two great races.” 

“One great race,” I said. 



TRANSSTAR 



131 



“Of course,” he said affably, 
“May we have our lives spared?” 
“We want you to have them — so 
you can take the word home.” 

The action outside had stilled. 
I opened the ports and began to 
move slowly towards another plan- 
et where the eaber had dwellings, 
as requested by the shaken Euben. 
Rackril patted my shoulder. “Boy, 
that Transstar!” he exulted. 

“It’s quite a lot,” I admitted. I 
painfully inched over to the 
stricken Martha and squeezed her 
hand. I thought she squeezed back. 
I thought I saw a flicker of joy at 
our success — but there was so 
much eaber and so much death in 
her eyes it was hard to know. I had 
to leave her then, for the medics 
came aboard for her. 

I began to glide down on the 
new planet to discharge Euben and 
the other eaber. “Look,” I said ges- 
turing over my shoulder. Behind us 
the Transstar fleet followed docile- 
ly, the mass and weight of them, 
guns racked and quiet, the great 
beast behind my tiny patrol dot. 

“We’ll stay around a few days 
in case you want to argue some 
more,” I told Euben. 

He shook his head. “That will 
not be necessary, my good friend. 
We are not stupid. In the future 
you’ll see very little of the eaber.” 

r | 1 HE ship settled. I opened the 
door and put down the ladder 
and Euben’s companion descended, 

132 



then Euben. “I am sorry—” he be- 
gan. 

But I thought of Martha and 
the dead boy who had died on 
Everready and the pet human and 
the drone eaber and the others 
who had suffered and died to make 
this creature sorry. So I planted my 
good foot on his rear. He crashed 
into his master and they both fell 
in the mud at the bottom of the 
ladder. They got up, mud-splat- 
tered, and ran like the wind to- 
wards eaberdom, capes flying out 
behind them. 

Rackril laughed. It was the first 
relaxed laugh I’d heard in all that 
assignment. It pulled things back 
to normal. 

I turned back to my blazing 
board and hit a button. “Condition 
White,” I said, “and don’t kid me 
that you got up all these star-ships 
on seventy-five seconds notice. 
They left Earth-alpha weeks ago. 
You knew from the first we were 
in for a Condition Prime Total Red 
with the eaber.” 

The old man grinned. “It’s the 
agents who louse us up. We were 
afraid you’d observe so long that 
you’d start the action on an orange 
and build a whole new tradition — 
Ten.” 

Ten! I remembered then that 
anybody who ordered a CPTR was 
automatically up for Ten rank and 
sent to a nice, soft job at Prime. 

“Save me a wide, plump chair at 
the TV console at Prime,” I said. 



GALAXY 



“Get me a desk-sized teapot, and a 
soft cushion for a bum leg.” 

I turned the ship around and 
started to lead the massive fleet 
home. 

I stared at the far-flung stars of 
space as I drank my tea, eyes 
blurred a little with tears. I was 
an organization man. The organi- 
zation was all I had, or would ever 
have. It didn’t seem enough. Even 
the playing of the Transstar victory 
song left me depressed. 

Then suddenly the light broke. 



A Transstar agent is both the 
most and the least important of 
men. He is a fireman who puts out 
fires — a hero, but a shadow. A mas- 
ter sometimes, but mostly a 
servant. I winked at Mayberry on 
the screen. They saw I knew and 
winked back. They had finally lost 
a pompous, Transstar-impressed 
agent and gained a useful career 
man. 

They were satisfied. 

So was I.

Bright sunlight

Who he was, and what he was doing 
here, was clouded. The truth lurked 
in some corner of his consciousness, 
but it was not reached by surface 
awareness. 



The corridor opened at last into 
a large high-domed room, much 
like a railway station or an air ter- 
minal. He walked straight ahead. 

At the sight of him a man lean- 
ing negligently against a stone pil- 
lar, to his right but within vision, 
straightened and barked an order 
to him, “Halt!” He lengthened his 
stride but gave no other sign. 



MONKEY ON H IS BACK 



135 



Two men hurried through a 
doorway of a small anteroom to his 
left, calling to him. He turned away 
and began to run. 

Shouts and the sound of charg- 
ing feet came from behind him. He 
cut to the right, running toward the 
escalator to the second floor. An- 
other pair of men were hurrying 
down, two steps at a stride. With 
no break in pace he veered into an 
opening beside the escalator. 

At the first turn he saw that the 
aisle merely circled the stairway, 
coming out into the depot again on 
the other side. It was a trap. He 
glanced quickly around him. 

At the rear of the space was a 
row of lockers for traveler use. He 
slipped a coin into a pay slot, 
opened the zipper on his bag and 
pulled out a flat briefcase. It took 
him only a few seconds to push the 
case into the compartment, lock it 
and slide the key along the floor 
beneath the locker. 

There was nothing to do after 
that — except wait. 

The men pursuing him came 
hurtling around the turn in the 
aisle. He kicked his knapsack to 
one side, spreading his feet wide 
with an instinctive motion. 

Until that instant he had in- 
tended to fight. Now he swiftly 
reassessed the odds. There were 
five of them, he saw. He should be 
able to incapacitate two or three 
and break out. But the fact that 
they had been expecting him meant 



that others would very probably 
be waiting outside. His best course 
now was to sham ignorance. He 
relaxed. 

He offered no resistance as they 
reached him. 

They were not gentle men. A tall 
ruffian, copper-brown face damp 
with perspiration and body oil, 
grabbed him by the jacket and 
slammed him back against the 
lockers. As he shifted his weight 
to keep his footing someone drove 
a fist into his face. He started to 
raise his hands; and a hard flat 
object crashed against the side of 
his skull. 

The starch went out of his legs. 

6cn° you make anything out of 
it?” the psychoanalyst Mil- 
ton Bergstrom, asked. 

John Zarwell shook his head. 
“Did I talk while I was under?” 

“Oh, yes. You were supposed to. 
That way I follow pretty well what 
you’re reenacting.” 

“How does it tie in with what I 
told you before?” 

Bergstrom’s neat-boned, fair- 
skinned face betrayed no emotion 
other than an introspective stillness 
of his normally alert gaze. “I see 
no connection,” he decided, his 
words once again precise and metic- 
ulous. “We don’t have enough to 
go on. Do you feel able to try an- 
other comanalysis this afternoon 
yet?” 

“I don’t see why not.” Zarwell 
GALAXY 



136 



opened the collar of his shirt. The 
day was hot, and the room had no 
air conditioning, still a rare luxury 
on St. Martin’s. The office window 
was open, but it let in no freshness, 
only the mildly rank odor that per- 
vaded all the planet’s habitable 
area. 

“Good.” Bergstrom rose. “The 
serum is quite harmless, John.” He 
maintained a professional diver- 
sionary chatter as he administered 
the drug. “A scopolamine deriva- 
tive that’s been well tested.” 

The floor beneath Zarwell’s feet 
assumed abruptly the near trans- 
fluent consistency of a damp 
sponge. It rose in a foot-high wave 
and rolled gently toward the far 
wall. 

Bergstrom continued talking, 
with practiced urbanity. “When 
psychiatry was a less exact science,” 
his voice went on, seeming to come 
from a great distance, “a doctor 
had to spend weeks, sometimes 
months or years interviewing a 
patient. If he was skilled enough, 
he could sort the relevancies from 
the vast amount of chaff. We are 
able now, with the help of the 
serum, to confine our discourses to 
matters cogent to the patient’s 
trouble.” 

The floor continued its transmu- 
tation, and Zarwell sank deep into 
viscous depths. “Lie back and relax. 
Don’t . .” 

The words tumbled down from 
above. They faded, were gone. 

MONKEY ON HIS BACK 



ZARWELL FOUND himself 
standing on a vast plain. There was 
no sky above, and no horizon in the 
distance. He was in a place without 
space or dimension. There was 
nothing here except himself — and 
the gun that he held in his hand. 

A weapon beautiful in its effi- 
cient simplicity. 

He should know all about the 
instrument, its purpose and work- 
ings, but he could not bring his 
thoughts into rational focus. His 
forehead creased with his mental 
effort. 

Abruptly the unreality about 
him shifted perspective. He was 
approaching — not walking, but 
merely shortening the space be- 
tween them — the man who held 
the gun. The man who was him- 
self. The other “himself” drifted 
nearer also, as though drawn by a 
mutual attraction. 

The man with the gun raised his 
weapon and pressed the trigger. 

With the action the perspective 
shifted again. He was watching the 
face of the man he shot jerk and 
twitch, expand and contract. The 
face was unharmed, yet it was no 
longer the same. No longer his own 
features. 

The stranger face smiled approv- 
ingly at him. 

“ODD,” BERGSTROM said. 
He brought his hands up and joined 
the tips of his fingers against his 
chest. “But it’s another piece in the 



137 



jig-saw. In time it will fit into 
place.” He paused. “It means no 
more to you than the first, I sup- 
pose?” 

“No,” Zarwell answered. 

He was not a talking man, Berg- 
strom reflected. It was more than 
reticence, however. The man had 
a hard granite core, only partially 
concealed by his present perplexity. 
He was a man who could handle 
himself well in an emergency. 

Bergstrom shrugged, dismissing 
his strayed thoughts. “I expected 
as much. A quite normal first phase 
of treatment.” He straightened a 
paper on his desk. “I think that will 
be enough for today. Twice in one 
sitting is about all we ever try. 
Otherwise some particular episode 
might cause undue mental stress, 
and set up a block.” He glanced 
down at his appointment pad. “To- 
morrow at two, then?” 

Zarwell grunted acknowledg- 
ment and pushed himself to his 
feet, apparently unaware that his 
shirt clung damply to his body. 

TP HE sun was still high when 
Zarwell left the analyst’s office. 
The white marble of the city’s 
buildings shimmered in the after- 
noon heat, squat and austere as 
giant tree trunks, pock-marked and 
gray-mottled with windows. Zar- 
well was careful not to rest his hand 
on the flesh searing surface of the 
stone. \ 

The evening meal hour was ap- 
138 



proaching when he reached the 
Flats, on the way to his apartment 
The streets of the old section were 
near-deserted. The only sounds he 
heard as he passed were the occa- 
sional cry of a baby, chronically 
uncomfortable in the day’s heat, 
and the lowing of imported cattle 
waiting in a nearby shed to be 
shipped to the country. 

All St. Martin’s has a distinctive 
smell, as of an arid dried-out 
swamp, with a faint taint of fish. 
But in the Flats the odor changes. 
Here is the smell of factories, ware- 
houses, and trading marts; the smell 
of stale cooking drifting from the 
homes of the laborers and lower 
class techmen who live there. 

Zarwell passed a group of 
smaller children playing a desul- 
tory game of lic-lic for pieces of 
candy and cigarettes. Slowly he 
climbed the stairs of a stone flat 
He prepared a supper for himself 
and ate it without either enjoy- 
ment or distaste. He lay down, fully 
clothed, on his bed. The visit to the 
analyst had done nothing to dispel 
his ennui. 

The next morning when Zarwell 
awoke he lay for a moment, un- 
moving. The feeling was there 
again, like a scene waiting only to 
be gazed at directly to be per- 
ceived. It was as though a great wis- 
dom lay at the edge of understand- 
ing. If he rested quietly it would 
all come to him. Yet always, when 
his mind lost its sleep-induced 
GALAXY 




MONKEY ON HIS BACK 



139 



lethargy, the moment of near un- 
derstanding slipped away. 

This morning, however, the sense 
of disorientation did not pass with 
full wakefulness. He achieved no 
understanding, but the strangeness 
did not leave as he sat up. 

He gazed about him. The room 
did not seem to be his own. The 
furnishings, and the clothing he ob- 
served in a closet, might have be- 
longed to a stranger. 

He pulled himself from his blan- 
kets, his body moving with me- 
chanical reaction. The slippers into 
which he put his feet were larger 
than he had expected them to be. 
He walked about the small apart- 
ment. The place was familiar, but 
only as it would have been if he 
had studied it from blueprints, not 
as though he lived there. 

The feeling was still with him 
when he returned to the psycho- 
analyst. 

f IP HE scene this time was more 
kaleidoscopic, less personal. 

A village was being ravaged. 
Men struggled and died in the 
streets. Zarwell moved among 
them, seldom taking part in the 
individual clashes, yet a moving 
force in the confict. 

The background changed. He 
understood that he was on a dif- 
ferent world. 

Here a city burned. Its resistance 
was nearing its end. Zarwell was 
riding a shaggy pony outside a high 
140 



wall surrounding the stricken me- 
tropolis. He moved in and joined a 
party of short, bearded men, direct- 
ing them as they battered at the 
wall with a huge log mounted on a 
many-wheeled truck. 

The log broke a breach in the 
concrete and the besiegers charged 
through, carrying back the defend- 
ers who sought vainly to plug the 
gap. Soon there would be rioting 
in the streets again, plundering and 
killing. 

Zarwell was not the leader of the 
invaders, only a lesser figure in the 
rebellion. But he had played a lead- 
ing part in the planning of the 
strategy that led to the city’s fall. 
The job had been well done. 

Time passed, without visible 
break in the panorama. Now Zar- 
well was fleeing, pursued by the 
same bearded men who had been 
his comrades before. Still he moved 
with the same firm purpose, vigi- 
lant, resourceful, and well prepared 
for the eventuality that had be- 
fallen. He made his escape without 
difficulty. 

He alighted from a space ship on 
still another world — another shift 
in time — and the atmosphere of 
conflict engulfed him. 

Weary but resigned he accepted 
it, and did what he had to do . 

BERGSTROM WAS regarding 
him with speculative scrutiny. 
“You’ve had quite a past, appar- 
ently,” he observed.

Zarwell smiled with mild embar- 
rassment. “At least in my dreams.” 

“Dreams?” Bergstrom’s eyes 
widened in surprise. “Oh, I beg your 
pardon. I must have forgotten to 
explain. This work is so routine to 
me that sometimes I forget it’s all 
new to a patient. Actually what you 
experienced under the drug were 
not dreams. They were recollec- 
tions of real episodes from your 
past.” 

Zarwell’s expression became 
wary. He watched Bergstrom 
closely. After a minute, however, 
he seemed satisfied, and he let him- 
self settle back against the cushion 
of his chair. “I remember nothing 
of what I saw,” he observed. 

“That’s why you’re here, you 
know,” Bergstrom answered. “To 
help you remember.” 

“But everything under the drug 
is so . .” 

“Haphazard? That’s true. The 
recall episodes are always purely 
random, with no chronological se- 
quence. Our problem will be to re- 
assemble them in proper order 
later. Or some particular scene may 
trigger a complete memory return. 

“It is my considered opinion,” 
Bergstrom went on, “that your lost 
memory will turn out to be no ordi- 
nary amnesia. I believe we will find 
that your mind has been tampered 
with.” 

“Nothing I’ve seen under the 
drug fits into the past I do re- 
member.” 

MONKEY ON HIS BACK 



“That’s what makes me so cer- 
tain,” Bergstrom said confidently. 
“You don’t remember what we 
have shown to be true. Conversely 
then, what you think you remember 
must be false. It must have been 
implanted there. But we can go 
into that later. For today I think 
we have done enough. This episode 
was quite prolonged.” 

“I won’t have any time off again 
until next week end,” Zarwell re- 
minded him. 

“That’s right.” Bergstrom 
thought for a moment. “We 
shouldn’t let this hang too long. 
Could you come here after work 
tomorrow?” 

“I suppose I could.” 

“Fine,” Bergstrom said with sat- 
isfaction. “I’ll admit I’m consider- 
ably more than casually interested 
in your case by this time.” 

A WORK truck picked Zarwell 
up the next morning and he 
rode with a tech crew to the edge of 
the reclam area. Beside the belt 
bringing ocean muck from the con- 
verter plant at the seashore his 
bulldozer was waiting. 

He took his place behind the 
drive wheel and began working dirt 
down between windbreakers an- 
chored in the rock. Along a make- 
shift road into the badlands trucks 
brought crushed lime and phos- 
phorus to supplement the ocean 
sediment. The progress of life from 
the sea to the land was a mechani- 

141 



cal process of this growing world. 

Nearly two hundred years ago, 
when Earth established a colony on 
St. Martin’s, the land surface of the 
planet had been barren. Only its 
seas thrived with animal and vege- 
table life. The necessary machinery 
and technicians had been supplied 
by Earth, and the long struggle be- 
gan to fit the world for human 
needs. When Zarwell arrived, six 
months before, the Vitalized area 
already extended three hundred 
miles along the coast, and sixty 
miles inland. And every day the 
progress continued. A large per- 
centage of the energy and resources 
of the world were devoted to that 
essential expansion. 

The reclam crews filled and 
sodded the sterile rock, planted 
binding grasses, grain and trees, and 
diverted rivers to keep it fertile. 
When there were no rivers to divert 
they blasted out springs and lakes 
in the foothills to make their own. 
Biologists developed the necessary 
germ and insect life from what they 
found in the sea. Where that failed, 
they imported microorganisms 
from Earth. 

Three rubber-tracked crawlers 
picked their way down from the 
mountains until they joined the 
road passing the belt. They were 
loaded with ore that would be 
smelted into metal for depleted 
Earth, or for other colonies short 
of minerals. It was St. Martin’s only 
export thus far. 

142 



Zarwell pulled his sun helmet 
lower, to better guard his hot, dry 
features. The wind blew continu- 
ously on St. Martin’s, but it fur- 
nished small relief from the heat. 
After its three-thousand-mile jour- 
ney across scorched sterile rock, it 
sucked the moisture from a man’s 
body, bringing a membrane-shrink- 
ing dryness to the nostrils as it was 
breathed in. With it came also the 
cloying taste of limestone in a 
worker’s mouth. 

Zarwell gazed idly about at the 
other laborers. Fully three-quarters 
of them were beri-rabza ridden. A 
cure for the skin fungus had not 
yet been found; the men’s faces 
and hands were scabbed and red. 
The colony had grown to near self- 
sufficiency, would soon have a mod- 
erate prosperity, yet they still 
lacked adequate medical and re- 
search facilities. 

Not all the world’s citizens were 
content. 

Bergstrom was waiting in his of- 
fice when Zarwell arrived that 
evening. 

1LXE was lying motionless on a 
hard cot, with his eyes closed, 
yet with his every sense sharply 
quickened. Tentatively he tight- 
ened small muscles in his arms and 
legs. Across his wrists and thighs 
he felt straps binding him to the 
cot. 

“So that’s our big, bad man,” a 
coarse voice above him observed 
GALAXY 



caustically. “He doesn’t look so 
tough now, does he?” 

“It might have been better to 
kill him right away,” a second, less 
confident voice said. “It’s supposed 
to be impossible to hold him.” 
“Don’t be stupid. We just do 
what we’re told. We’ll hold him.” 
“What do you think they’ll do 
with him?” 

“Execute him, I suppose,” the 
harsh voice said matter-of-factly. 
“They’re probably just curious to 
see what he looks like first. They’ll 
be disappointed.” 

Zarwell opened his eyes a slit to 
observe his surroundings. 

It was a mistake. “He’s out of 
it,” the first speaker said, and Zar- 
well allowed his eyes to open fully. 

The voice, he saw, belonged to 
the big man who had bruised him 
against the locker at the spaceport. 
Irrelevantly he wondered how he 
knew now that it had been a space- 
port. 

His captor’s broad face jeered 
down at Zarwell. “Have a good 
sleep?” he asked with mock solici- 
tude. Zarwell did not deign to ac- 
knowledge that he heard. 

The big man turned. “You can 
tell the Chief he’s awake,” he said. 
Zarwell followed his gaze to where 
a younger man, with a blond lock of 
hair on his forehead, stood behind 
him. The youth nodded and went 
out, while the other pulled a chair 
up to the side of Zarwell’s cot. 

While their attention was away 
MONKEY ON HIS BACK 



from him Zarwell had unobtrusive- 
ly loosened his bonds as much as 
possible with arm leverage. As the 
big man drew his chair nearer, he 
made the hand farthest from him 
tight and compact and worked it 
free of the leather loop. He waited. 

The big man belched. “You’re 
supposed to be great stuff in a situ- 
ation like this,” he said, his smoke- 
tan face splitting in a grin that re- 
vealed large square teeth. “How 
about giving me a sample?” 

“You’re a yellow-livered bas- 
tard,” Zarwell told him. 

The grin faded from the oily face 
as the man stood up. He leaned over 
the cot — and Zarwell’s left hand 
shot up and locked about his throat, 
joined almost immediately by the 
right. 

The man’s mouth opened and he 
tried to yell as he threw himself 
frantically backward. He clawed at 
the hands about his neck. When 
that failed to break the grip he sud- 
denly reversed his weight and 
drove his fist at Zarwell’s head. 

Zarwell pulled the struggling 
body down against his chest and 
held it there until all agitated 
movement ceased. He sat up then, 
letting the body slide to the floor. 

The straps about his thighs came 
loose with little effort. 

TP HE analyst dabbed at his upper 
lip with a handkerchief. “The 
episodes are beginning to tie to- 
gether,” he said, with an attempt at 

143 



nonchalance. “The next couple 
should do it.” 

Zarwell did not answer. His 
memory seemed on the point of 
complete return, and he sat quietly, 
hopefully. However, nothing more 
came and he returned his attention 
to his more immediate problem. 

Opening a button on his shirt, he 
pulled back a strip of plastic cloth 
just below his rib cage and took 
out a small flat pistol. He held it 
in the palm of his hand. He knew 
now why he always carried it. 

Bergstrom had his bad moment. 
“You’re not going to . .” he began 
at the sight of the gun. He tried 
again. “You must be joking.” 

“I have very little sense of hu- 
mor,” Zarwell corrected him. 

“You’d be foolish!” 

Bergstrom obviously realized 
how close he was to death. Yet 
surprisingly, after the first start, 
he showed little fear. Zarwell had 
thought the man a bit soft, too 
adjusted to a life of ease and some 
prestige to meet danger calmly. 
Curiosity restrained his trigger fin- 
ger. 

“Why would I be foolish?” he 
asked. “Your Meninger oath of in- 
violable confidence?” 

Bergstrom shook his head. “I 
know it’s been broken before. But 
you need me. You’re not through, 
you know. If you killed me you’d 
still have to trust some other 
analyst.” 

“Is that the best you can do?” 



“No.” Bergstrom was angry now. 
“But use that logical mind you’re 
supposed to have! Scenes before 
this have shown what kind of man 
you are. Just because this last hap- 
pened here on St. Martin’s makes 
little difference. If I was going to 
turn you in to the police, I’d have 
done it before this.” 

Zarwell debated with himself the 
truth of what the other had said. 
‘Why didn’t you turn me in?” he 
asked. 

“Because you’re no mad-dog 
killer!” Now that the crisis seemed 
to be past, Bergstrom spoke more 
calmly, even allowed himself to 
relax. “You’re still pretty much in 
the fog about yourself. I read more 
in those comanalyses than you did. 
I even know who you are!” 
Zarwell’s eyebrows raised. 

‘Who am I?” he asked, very in- 
terested now. Without attention he 
put his pistol away in a trouser 
pocket. 

Bergstrom brushed the question 
aside with one hand. “Your name 
makes little difference. You’ve used 
many. But you are an idealist. Your 
killings were necessary to bring 
justice to the places you visited. By 
now you’re almost a legend among 
the human worlds. I’d like to talk 
more with you on that later.” 
While Zarwell considered, Berg- 
strom pressed his advantage. “One 
more scene might do it,” he said. 
“Should we try again — if you trust 
me, that is?" 



144 



GALAXY 



Zarwell made his decision quick- 
ly. “Go ahead,” he answered. 

A LL Zarwell’s attention seemed 
on the cigar he lit as he rode 
down the escalator, but he surveyed 
the terminal carefully over the rim 
of his hand. He spied no suspicious 
loungers. 

Behind the escalator he groped 
along the floor beneath the lockers 
until he found his key. The brief- 
case was under his arm a minute 
later. 

In the basement lave he put a 
coin in the pay slot of a private 
compartment and went in. 

As he zipped open the briefcase 
he surveyed his features in the mir- 
ror. A small muscle at the comer of 
one eye twitched spasmodically. 
One cheek wore a frozen quarter 
smile. Thirty-six hours under the 
paralysis was longer than advisable. 
The muscles should be rested at 
least every twenty hours. 

Fortunately his natural features 
would serve as an adequate dis- 
guise now. 

He adjusted the ring setting on 
the pistol-shaped instrument that 
he took from his case, and care- 
fully rayed several small areas of 
his face, loosening muscles that had 
been tight too long. He sighed 
gratefully when he finished, mas- 
saging his cheeks and forehead with 
considerable pleasure. Another 
glance in the mirror satisfied him 
with the changes that had been 



made. He turned to his briefcase 
again and exchanged the gun for 
a small syringe, which he pushed 
into a trouser pocket, and a single- 
edged razor blade. 

Removing his fiber-cloth jacket 
he slashed it into strips with the 
razor blade and flushed it down the 
disposal bowl. With the sleeves of 
his blouse rolled up he had the 
appearance of a typical workman 
as he strolled from the compart- 
ment. 

Back at the locker he replaced 
the briefcase and, with a wad of 
gum, glued the key to the bottom 
of the locker frame. 

One step more. Taking the syr- 
inge from his pocket, he plunged 
the needle into his forearm and 
tossed the instrument down a 
waste chute. He took three more 
steps and paused uncertainly. 

When he looked about him it 
was with the expression of a man 
waking from a vivid dream. 

fe O UITE ingenious,” Graves 

V murmured admiringly. “You 
had your mind already precondi- 
tioned for the shot. But why would 
you deliberately give yourself am- 
nesia?” 

“What better disguise than to 
believe the part you’re playing?” 

“A good man must have done 
that job on your mind,” Bergstrom 
commented. “I’d have hesitated to 
try it myself. It must have taken a 
lot of trust on your part.” 



MONKEY ON HIS BACK 



145 



“Trust and money,” Zarwell said 
drily. 

“Your memory’s back then?” 

Zarwell nodded. 

“I’m glad to hear that,” Berg- 
strom assured him. “Now that 
you’re well again I’d like to intro- 
duce you to a man named Vernon 
Johnson. This world . .” 

Zarwell stopped him with an up- 
raised hand. “Good God, man, can’t 
you see the reason for all this? I’m 
tired. I’m trying to quit.” 

“Quit?” Bergstrom did not quite 
follow him. 

“It started on my home colony,” 
Zarwell explained listlessly. “A 
gang of hoods had taken over the 
government. I helped organize a 
movement to get them out. There 
was some bloodshed, but it went 
quite well. Several months later an 
unofficial envoy from another 
world asked several of us to give 
them a hand on the same kind of 
job. The political conditions there 
were rotten. We went with him. 
Again we were successful. It seems 
I have a kind of genius for that 
sort of thing.” 

He stretched out his legs and re- 
garded them thoughtfully. “I 
learned then the truth of Russell’s 
saying: ‘When the oppressed win 
their freedom they are as oppres- 
sive as their former masters.’ When 
they went bad, I opposed them. 
This time I failed. But I escaped 
again. I have quite a talent for that 
also. 



“I’m not a professional do- 
gooder.” Zarwell’s tone appealed 
to Bergstrom for understanding. “I 
have only a normal man’s indigna- 
tion at injustice. And now I’ve done 
my share. Yet, wherever I go, the 
word eventually gets out, and I’m 
right back in a fight again. It’s like 
the proverbial monkey on my back. 
I can’t get rid of it.” 

He rose. “That disguise and 
memory planting were supposed to 
get me out of it. I should have 
known it wouldn’t work. But this 
time I’m not going to be drawn 
back in! You and your Vernon 
Johnson can do your own revolting. 
I’m through!” 

Bergstrom did not argue as he 
left. 

OESTLESSNESS drove Zar- 
-*-* well from his flat the next day 
—a legal holiday on St Martin’s. At 
a railed-off lot he stopped and loi- 
tered in the shadow of an adjacent 
building watching workmen drill- 
ing an excavation for a new struc- 
ture. 

When a man strolled to his side 
and stood watching the workmen, 
he was not surprised. He waited for 
the other to speak. 

“I’d like to talk to you, if you 
can spare a few minutes,” the 
stranger said. 

Zarwell turned and studied the 
man without answering. He wa$ 
medium tall, with the body of an 
athlete, though perhaps ten year 



146 



GALAXY 



beyond the age of sports. He had 
a manner of contained energy. 
“You’re Johnson?” he asked. 

The man nodded. 

Zarwell tried to feel the anger he 
wanted to feel, but somehow it 
would not come. “We have nothing 
to talk about,” was the best he 
could manage. 

“Then will you just listen? After, 
I’ll leave — if you tell me to.” 

Against his will he found himself 
liking the man, and wanting at least 
to be courteous. He inclined his 
head toward a curb wastebox 'with 
a flat top. “Should we sit?” 

Johnson smiled agreeably and 
they walked over to the box and 
sat down. 

“When this colony was first 
founded,” Johnson began without 
preamble, “the administrative body 
was a governor, and a council of 
twelve. Their successors were to 
be elected biennially. At first they 
were. Then things changed. We 
haven’t had an election now in the 
last twenty-three years. St. Mar- 
tin’s is beginning to prosper. Yet 
the only ones receiving the benefits 



are the rulers. The citizens work 
twelve hours a day. They are poorly 
house, poorly fed, poorly clothed. 
They ...” 

Zarwell found himself not listen- 
ing as Johnson’s voice went on. The 
story was always the same. But why 
did they always try to drag him into 
their troubles? 

Why hadn’t he chosen some 
other world on which to hide? 

The last question prompted a 
new thought. Just why had he 
chosen St. Martin’s? Was it only a 
coincidence? Or had he, subcon- 
ciously at least, picked this par- 
ticular world? He had always 
considered himself the unwilling 
subject of glib persuaders . but 
mightn’t some inner compulsion of 
his own have put the monkey on his 
back? 

“. and we need your help.” 
Johnson had finished his speech. 

Zarwell gazed up at the bright 
sky. He pulled in a long breath, 
and let it out in a sigh. 

“What are your plans so far?” 
he asked wearily.

D HAR Ry sat alone in his 
room, meditating. From 
outside the door he caught 
a thought wave equivalent to a 
knock, and, glancing at the door, 
he willed it to slide open. 

It opened. “Enter, my friend,” he 
said. He could have projected the 



idea telepathically; but with only 
two persons present, speech was 
more polite. 

Ejon Khee entered. “You are 
up late tonight, my leader,” he said. 

“Yes, Khee. Within an hour the 
Earth rocket is due to land, and I 
wish to see it. Yes, I know, it will

land a thousand miles away, if their 
calculations are correct. Beyond 
the horizon. But if it lands even 
twice that far the flash of the 
atomic explosion should be visible. 
And I have waited long for first 
contact. For even though no Earth- 
man will be on that rocket, it will 
still be first contact — for them. Of 
course our telepath teams have 
been reading their thoughts for 
many centuries, but — this will be 
the first physical contact between 
Mars and Earth.” 

Khee made himself comfortable 
on one of the low chairs. “True,” 
he said. “I have not followed recent 
reports too closely, though. Why 
are they using an atomic warhead? 
I know they suppose our planet is 
uninhabited, but still—” 

“They will watch the flash 
through their lunar telescopes and 
get a — what do they call it? — a 
spectroscopic analysis. That will 
tell them more than they know now 
(or think they know; much of it is 
erroneous) about the atmosphere 
of our planet and the composition 
of its surface. It is — call it a sight- 
ing shot, Khee. They’ll be here in 
person within a few oppositions. 
And then-” 

Mars was holding out, waiting 
for Earth to come. What was left 
of Mars, that is; this one small city 
of about nine hundred beings. The 
civilization of Mars was older than 
that of Earth, but it was a dying 
one. This was what remained of it: 



one city, nine hundred people. 
They were waiting for Earth to 
make contact, for a selfish reason 
and for an unselfish one. 

1%/r ARTIAN civilization had de- 
ITJ. ve i 0 ped in a quite different 
direction from that of Earth. It had 
developed no important knowledge 
of the physical sciences, no tech- 
nology. But it had developed so- 
cial sciences to the point where 
there had not been a single crime, 
let alone a war, on Mars for fifty 
thousand years. And it had devel- 
oped fully the parapsychological 
sciences of the mind, which Earth 
was just beginning to discover. 

Mars could teach Earth much. 
How to avoid crime and war to be- 
gin with. Beyond those simple 
things lay telepathy, telekinesis, 
empathy , . 

And Earth would, Mars hoped, 
teach them something even more 
valuable to Mars: how, by science 
and technology — which it was too 
late for Mars to develop now, even 
if they had the type of minds which 
would enable them to develop 
these things — to restore and re- 
habilitate a dying planet, so that 
an otherwise dying race might live 
and multiply again. 

Each planet would gain greatly, 
and neither would lose. 

And tonight was the night when 
Earth would make its first sight- 
ing shot. Its next shot, a rocket 
containing Earthmen, or at least an 



EARTHMEN BEARING GIFTS 



149 



Earthman, would be at the next op- 
position, two Earth years, or rough- 
ly four Martian years, hence. The 
Martians knew this, because their 
teams of telepaths were able to 
catch at least some of the thoughts 
of Earthmen, enough to know their 
plans. Unfortunately, at that dis- 
tance, the connection was one-way. 
Mars could not ask Earth to hurry 
its program. Or tell Earth scien- 
tists the facts about Mars’ compo- 
sition and atmosphere which would 
have made this preliminary shot 
unnecessary. 

Tonight Ry, the leader (as near- 
ly as the Martian word can be 
translated), and Khee, his adminis- 
trative assistant and closest friend^ 
sat and meditated together until 
the time was near. Then they drank 
a toast to the future — in a beverage 
based on menthol, which had the 
same effect on Martians as alcohol 
on Earthmen — and climbed to the 
roof of the building in which they 
had been sitting. They watched to- 
ward the north, where the rocket 



should land. The stars shone bril- 
liantly and unwinkingly through 
the atmosphere. 

¥ N Observatory No. 1 on Earth’s 
moon, Rog Everett, his eye at 
the eyepiece of the spotter scope, 
said triumphantly, “Thar she blew, 
Willie. And now, as soon as the 
films are developed, we’ll know the 
score on that old planet Mars.” He 
straightened up — there’d be no 
more to see now — and he and 
Willie Sanger shook hands solemn- 
ly. It was an historical occasion. 

“Hope it didn’t kill anybody. 
Any Martians, that is. Rog, did it 
hit dead center in Syrtis Major?” 
“Near as matters. I’d say it was 
maybe a thousand miles off, to the 
south. And that’s damn close on a 
fifty-million-mile shot. Willie, do 
you really think there are any Mar- 
tians?” 

Willie thought a second and 
then said, “No.” 

He was right.

ROBOT HUNT by Roger Lee 
Vernon. Avalon Books, N. Y. 
S2.95. 

LOADED WITH action, mystery 
and intrigue, this book unfortu- 
nately goes off in the author’s face. 

Vernon’s future world is inven- 
tive in the pattern set by Hugo 
Gernsback. World War III has 
been averted by the perfection of 
the force screen, available in every 
size, from personal to the large, 
economy continent-size which en- 
ables nations to hide and to pull 
in the holes after them. After years 
of stalemate, America has devel- 
oped robots that can pass as hu- 
man, and the “Equalizer,” the ulti- 
mate force-screen penetrant. 

The plot is built on the theft of 
the plans by a rogue robot — which 
could not have had access to the 
plans or stolen them in the first 
place.

WHEN WE get to the Moon, 
above-surface flight will be out of 
the question, and immense crev- 
asses may make surface travel 
equally unfeasible. Prof. Oberth, 
at least godfather if not father of 
rocket flight, has put his still fertile 
brain to work on the problem and 
proposes a unipedal vehicle that 
can do a bit of both. 

First offered in his recent Man

these thoughts into design and con-

to field tests on the Moon itself.

FIFTEEN YEARS is a long time

Skyport is a delight to read — so 
much so that one could almost 
wish Siodmak were not so success- 
ful a Hollywood writer-director. 

The skyport itself is the fictional 
evolution of Wernher von Braun’s 
wheel-like space station, 1075 
miles up, so that it revolves orbit- 
wise in two hours. The deluxe- 
space-hotel idea, brainchild of 
physicist Lee Powers, requires 
considerable selling to the corpo- 
rate giants necessary to finance 
and erect such a structure. Once 
sold, the financial maneuverings 
and machinations become as haz- 
ardous to the project as the tech- 
nical problems.

The novel’s one weak point is 
the assumption that the U. S. 
would permit the first space station 
to be a purely civilian venture, put 
up there as the latest link of the 
Wharton hotel chain. If you can 
get past that, however, the super- 
latively imaginative wedding of fi- 
nance and science engineered by 
Siodmak will repay your charity 
tenfold.

THE QUEST OF EXCALIBUR 
by Leonard Wibberley. G. P. Put- 
nam’s Sons, N, Y S3.50 

THE WIZARD Merlin has had 
numerous fictional revivals, in 
marked contrast to his liege, Ar- 
thur Pendragon. As chronicler of 
their joint return, Wibberley, past- 
master of rib-tickling irony, seemed 
nothing short of ideal. But almost 
all the provocative situations con- 
jured up by him bewilderingly re- 
main unexplored. 

The yarn concerns itself with 
poor Princess Pamela, heiress to 
the throne of England, and her 
attempt to run away from her vel- 
vet prison. She inveigles a part- 
time truckdriver, an American Ar- 
thurian student, into helping her 
escape from Buckingham Palace. 
Unfortunately, all this happens af- 
ter a most promising opening in 
which an English ditchdigger is 
accused of poaching rabbits on the 
last scrap of land owned by a des- 



titute baronet. The baronet’s per- 
mission, granted two hours after 
his death, is being challenged in a 
court of law. 

King Arthur, summoned by the 
ditchdigger and the ghost of Sir 
Timothy, embarks on a Don Qui- 
xote quest via ancient Rolls Royce 
for the sword Excalibur. 

If only Princess Pam had stayed 
in her nice, cool palace, what a 
heart-warming yarn this might 
have been!

DROKE’S FORBEARANCE is 
phenomenal: he blueprints not a

he follows the threads of socio-

future, for his concern is with to- 
morrow, not the Millenium. 

His subjects — Working Wives, 
Senior Citizens, Dwindling Fami-

objects of gently humorous pro-

THE DARK DESTROYERS

OVER TWENTY years ago,

harass an overwhelming enemy 
into defeat by the adoption of mer- 
ciless nuisance tactics. A tragically 
few short years later, his theory 
was put to practical test in Occu- 
pied France, Norway, Yugoslavia, 
Russia and the Philippines. Al- 
though in no instance was the con- 
queror ousted, logistic disruption 
laid the occupiers open to easier 
invasion. 

Wellman’s yarn suffers from de- 
fects common to the period — vari- 
colored “rays” and an embarrass-

yarn, though, it stands quite suc- 
cuessfully on its own, as well as 
having the added interest engen-

THE WAR AGAINST THE 
RULL by A. E. van Vogt. Simon 
and Schuster, N. Y., $3.50 

OLD-TIMERS WILL remember 
how van Vogt burst into SF promi- 
nence with his exceptional stories 
of alien intelligences back in the 
’30s. Since then, few of his yarns 
have escaped the overabundance 
of tortouous plotting that charac- 
terizes his major works. Among 
these few are several that ap- 
peared sporadically in Astounding 
during Decade Forty. They have 
been assembled here into novel 
form without undue distortion and 
serve as a good example of how 
van Vogt writes when not doing 



wheel-within-wheel plotting. 

Rulls, wormlike monstrosities, 
can control light vibrations to en- 
able themselves to masquerade as 
humans. Fantastic safeguards 
must be exercised and fantastic 
situations and monsters arise until 
the war’s final resolution.

TO MY mind, there is no finer 
single volume suitable to serve as 
an introduction to science in gen-

that his amazing mind formulated 
the Theory of Optics, Universal

fore he reached the age of twenty-

IDEA MAN 



A ccording to this morn- 
ing’s paper, Arthur Pen- 
fold stands a good chance 
of being in the next Honours List. 
Sir Arthur — and I knew him when 
he was -a nobody, when he was a 
third-rate putterer, working in the 
electronic back-room laboratory 
research of Ferdinand’s Radio and 
Television. We had a lot in com- 
mon, he and I, that day we met. 
He’d had a bright idea, and fum- 
bled it, and he had been sacked. 



Illustrated by DILLON 

The same thing had happened to 
me. 

He, having no idea what to do 
next, had gravitated to a little pub 
at the end of the road where he 
had spent most of his working life. 
I had followed my nose there, too 
—and there the resemblance ends. 
Ideas are my stock in trade, and I 
had plenty of ideas what to do 
next. My search for beer was to 
drown a strong sense of injustice. 
Who wouldn’t? I mean, if you’d

The saddest words of all are 
these: I work my head to the 
bone and he takes the glory! 



GALAXY 



uncorked a twenty-four-carat, jew- 
eled-in-every-hole idea, and seen 
someone else muff it, like a mutton 
head — and then been blamed for 
the whole thing — wouldn’t you? 
It’s bad enough when a cracker of 
an idea goes sour, but to have him 
blame me for it! 

“You’re fired!” Robel had said. 
“You’re an idea man. You should 
have thought of this and you 
didn’t. You’re fired!” 

As if I could foresee everything! 
All right, I am an idea man, and 
don’t ever let anybody sell you the 
idea that ideas sell themselves — 
they don’t. That old line about 
building a better mousetrap just 
isn’t so. Getting ideas is tough. Get- 
ting them sold, at a profit, is what 
separates the dreamers from the 
doers. And getting blamed for 
somebody else’s goof — that was 
the end! 

So I was boiling. There’s six 
foot three of me, square, and none 
of it fat, so, when I boil, it looks 
sort of scary. Not that I was think- 
ing of anything like that when I 
shoved my way into this pub. I 
was making resolutions. Never 
again, I thought. Next time I get a 
good idea, I’ll push it, promote it, 
and profit from it myself. And I 
ran into Penfold, never dreaming 
that there was my next time wait- 
ing for me, 

I could cry, just thinking of it. 
Penfold the magnificent, the fa- 
mous, the lion of the day — and I 



had it all right in my hand, and I 
dropped it! Me— William S. Bright 
— idea man! 

I" T began, as I suppose all such 
things do, in the most banal 
way. Robel had sent for me, to 
give me my weekly pep talk. 
George Robel, my boss — Robel’s 
Rib Ticklers, The Famous Firm 
for Fun, jokes and jests, gags and 
gadgets for all occasions — a house- 
hold word. George Robel, a fat and 
balding Napoleon type, employed 
four idea men. We knew of each 
other, but never met. We avoided 
each other like the plague, scared 
of plagiarism. And he gave each 
one of us a going over once a week. 

“Ah, Bright!” he said, from be- 
hind his desk. “We haven’t been 
very Bright, this week, have we, 
Bright? We will have to do much 
better, won’t we, otherwise our 
prospects won’t be very Bright, will 
they?” And so on, with all the vari- 
ations. I think it was sheer self- 
defense against the cracks about 
my name which made me become 
an expert on ideas in the first place. 
I’m often asked, “Where do you get 
your ideas from?” — and I could 
quote a well-known author on that. 
“If I knew that,” he said, “I’d go 
back for more!” But you can’t talk 
like that to your employer. So I 
just let him talk himself dry. 

Coming out, I intercepted a 
knowing sneer from the girl in the 
outer office. 



IDEA MAN 



157 



“Well, well, Mr. Bright,” she 
cooed nastily. “Been neglecting 
your homework, again?" 

I stopped and leaned on her 
desk. “When I’m around you, 
Joyce, honey,” I told her, “there’s 
only one kind of homework I can 
think of!” This was nasty of me, 
because she was a girl with almost 
too much of everything — and ter- 
ribly self-conscio”s about it. 

“Surely,” she snapped right back, 
“you can’t mean that? Not me, the 
girl who’s all shape and no brains 
— remember?” 

Which was fair. As I said, having 
ideas is not enough. Joyce had one 
hundred per cent perfect eidetic 
recall. Let her see or hear a thing 
just once and she had it for always. 
So her head must have been as 
full of ideas as her dress was full 
of her — but she had no idea what 
to do with them. She didn’t have 
the wit to use her talents, even, 
until I sold her to Robel as a 
cheap, efficient and mobile filing 
cabinet. That was just one of my 
ideas which had paid off, and for 
which he was grateful for a whole 
week. And I had made rude refer- 
ences to her brain-power from time 
to time since. 

“Who cares about what’s inside?” 
I leered, keeping the gag rolling. 
“With what you’ve got on the out- 
side, it wouldn’t matter if you 
were hollow—” 

And it happened — a beautiful, 
big, bright idea — just like that! I 



was all on edge as I turned and 
staggered back into Robel’s office. 

“Get out!” he said. “Go back to 
work. I’m busy!” 

“I’ve go it!” I mumbled dazedly, 
“Got a cracker of an idea—” 

“Stay in!” he said in exactly the 
same tone. “Sit down. There. 
Talk!” 

“Pinups!” I said, and his bushy 
eyebrows went up. “Life-size!” I 
added, and the brows lowered 
again. 

“Been done,” he snorted, but I 
hadn’t finished yet. 

“Inflatable — plastic — balloons?” 

H E took his pudgy hands off the 
desk and sat quite still. I 
could see the glow spreading over 
him. 

“By George, Bright, I think you 
have something there!” he said, 
and shut his eyes. “Perfectly de- 
tailed copies, colored, life-size — 
and inflatable — fold away in a 
drawer, pack flat for mail orders — 
sounds right. Who should we 
model?” 

He was fast, once he started, but 
I was just ahead of him there. 

“Tina Teton,” I suggested, “very 
up and coming, out to make herself 
a name, but not in the star class 
yet. Known but not famous, if you 
get me. She’d be willing and she 
wouldn’t cost too much.” 

You see what I mean? You have 
to sell an idea. I knew that Robel 
went for the risque so long as it 



158 



GALAXY 



wasn’t risky, so I had him from that 
angle. Robel has a string oi items 
that never get in any catalogues. 
The grapevine sells them, just as 
it would sell this. Take, for in- 
stance, an item I’ll bet you never 
saw in print, a very fashionable 
pair of unmentionables, complete 
with frills and lace — the elastic is 
guaranteed to hold up for one hour 
— then body heat does something 
to the formula, and you get your 
kicks. 

That can be bought, if you know 
how, and plenty people do, it 
seems. And they’d be the ones 
who’d go for this, so I knew Robel 
would like it. But, for my sins, I 
also knew him as a hard man with 
the pennies. Thus Tina Teton. 

“All right!” Robel said briskly. 
“I’ll handle this. Just a minute.” 
He flipped his desk buzzer. “Joyce, 
come in here!” 

This was routine. I would recite 
the gist of my idea to her; she 
would blink, think, then tell me 
where and when she’d seen, heard 
or read of it before; I would hate 
her intestines, and go away to try 
again. But not this time. 

“It’s new to me,” she told him. 
For me, she added, “Trust you to 
think up a disgusting idea like 
that.” 

“You’re my inspiration,” I told 
her, and, as another spark lit up, 
I said, “See here, Mr. Robel — it 
might be a lot cheaper if you only 
had to get Tina Teton’s name and 



maybe her head. Joyce, here, could 
model the body—!” 

That repaid me tor all the dirty 
cracks, and a bit over. The next 
few weeks were hectic. Joyce was 
livid when she found that she had 
to be smothered in plaster, and 
broken out, like a chicken from its 
shell. She screamed so loud that 
Robel actually gave her a percen- 
tage of the net profit to shut up. 

I was highly unpopular around 
the office, but that was no change. 

T¥7ITHIN a week after that, we 
” had a thousand units from the 
first trial run and were stand- 
ing by for the flood. We sold four. 
Six weeks later, the number had 
swelled to nine, and I was in the 
office again. I guessed what for, 
and I had insurance — an idea I’d 
been hoarding just for some such 
moment. It was a string of cut- 
plastic jewels with a miniature 
light inside each one, and a hear- 
ing-aid battery built into the clasp. 
With a bi-metallic “flasher" to 
make it light up and switch off 
automatically — a novelty — no 
girl with any taste would be seen 
dead with one, but Robel didh’t 
sell to that kind, anyway. It soft- 
ened his anger a little — but not 
much. 

“A flop,” he growled. “You and 
your life-size balloons. Not so 
Bright, after all—” He had one 
standing by his desk as he spoke, 
and, standing as close as that to 



IDEA MAN

it, I didn’t wonder nobody wanted 
to buy. It scared me, somehow. 
With a picture on the wall, you 
know it’s a picture. But this thing 
was so real you could damn near 
see it breathe. 

I was mumbling something 
about being sorry, which I wasn’t, 
when one of our peddlers came in, 
and I was privileged to listen in 
on the conversation. He made a 
big thing out of the hard work he’d 
put in, trying to sell the balloons— 
and something else. 

“One chap,” he said, “seemed in- 
terested in the process — the idea 
itself. I think he has the notion 
that with a change here and there, 
plus a bit of know-how, he might 
be able to sell it—” 

“Better than we can, eh?” 

“I doubt it, Mr. Robel, but he 
was interested in buying the 
rights.” 

“Price?” 

“Well, he’s only a small man— 
he suggested five hundred.” 

“Double — in cash.” The tele- 
phone came into play, and there 
was some terse bargaining. In the 
end, we lost Tina Teton, in effigy, 
for seven hundred and fifty pounds, 
and Robel was able to use one of 
his precious stock of smiles. 

“I forgive you, Bright,” he said. 
“Apparently there are others who 
aren’t very bright either!” 

One month later, to the day, the 
blow fell. Braced for my routine 
dressing-down, because a man can’t 



have new ideas all the time, I 
entered the office, and Robel prac- 
tically hit me in the face with a 
copy of a trade journal. 

This not-very-bright “small” 
man had taken our idea — my idea 
— and given it a golden twist. Using 
a quick-setting plastic and a spray- 
on, peel-off technique, he was pro- 
ducing and supplying — by the 
thousand — shop-window dummies! 
It was so obvious I could have 
kicked myself. The rag trade was 
falling over itself to get them — all 
sizes and colorings and attitudes— 
lifelike, easy to store, easy to han- 
dle, and cheap. You glued a pair 
of shoes to a heavy base, inserted 
the feet before inflating, and they 
stood steady enough to wear 
clothes. There was even a mention 
of future developments — a per- 
sonal-copy service, for do-it-your- 
self dressmaking. This guy had 
thought of everything. 

Robel was livid in a deadly, cold 
way. 

“You’re fired!” he said. “You’re 
an idea man. You should have 
thought of this and you didn’t. 
You’re fired!” 

4 ND that was how I came to 
be at the bar of the Dog and 
Pullet on a Friday afternoon— and 
met Penfold. If there’d been any- 
one else in the place, I’d never 
have noticed him. He was that sort 
of person then. Small, ineffectual, 
helpless-looking, and a mumbler. I

bet that’s all changed now, but at 
the time I was in no mood to care. 

“Have one on me, friend,” I told 
him. “Whatever it is, have another. 
Join me in celebrating my emanci- 
pation from the yoke of servitude. 
A slave no longer, Billy Bright now 
works for Billy Bright!” 

“Lost your job?” he asked dully. 
“Me, too — just been sacked.” 

“Makes two of us. What did 
you do?” 

“Oh, nothing much.” He 
gloomed into his glass. “You might 
say I had an idea — and my chief 
liked the sound of it — so I worked 
on it — and it didn’t turn out the 
way he expected — so he gave me 
the sack.” 

“But that’s my story,” I mar- 
veled. “Word for word — exactly 
what fate did to me. That’s what 
it is — Kismet.” My intuition was 
into top gear, straight off. I knew, 
somehow, that this was fate’s re- 
payment for the dirty deal I’d just 
been handed. I escorted him to a 
table, sat him down and bade him 
tell all. 

“It’s something I’ve been work- 
ing on, on my own time, for more 
than ten years,” he mumbled. 
“About a year ago I began to get 
some interesting results, so I went 
to Mr. Ferdinand, my chief, and 
told him, and he was impressed.” 
He took time out to tell me that 
he was an electronics technologist, 
working for Ferdinands, that he 
spent all his spare time in his back 



room, fiddling about on a theory. 

I was practically foaming at the 
mouth by the time I interrupted. 
“What was the idea, for heaven’s 
sake?” 

“Matter transmission,” he said 
timidly, as if he expected me to 
throw something at him. I didn’t. 
I was too busy coughing back the 
part of my drink that had gone 
down the wrong way. 

“Matter transmission?” I 
choked. “Sending material objects 
by radio waves?” 

“You know about it, then?” 
“Man, it’s as old as the hills!” 
“Oh.” He looked quite worried. 
“I didn’t know it had been done.” 
“Outside the pages of fiction, 
Arthur,” I told him sorrowfully, 
“it has not, nor ever will be. I don’t 
wonder your boss gave you the 
heave-ho, if that is what you were 
trying to sell him. Matter trans- 
mission, hah!” I sat there shaking 
my head and wondering what had 
gone wrong with the old “feel,” 
that it could let me in for a nut 
like this. 

“But I did it!” he insisted. “That 
is, I did it — in a sort of a way. Mr. 
Ferdinand — he was like you, at 
first — until I showed him some of 
my results, and figures — and then 
he was different. ‘Penfold,’ he said 
to me, ‘I believe you might have 
something there. You carry on 
with it — on your own time, of 
course — but work on it!’ So I did. 
And this morning I went to see 



162 



GALAXY 



him with my very latest results—” 
“And he shot you out on your 
ear — for perfecting a method of 
matter transmission?” 

P ENFOLD looked sullen. “It 
wasn’t perfect — not to his way 
of thinking. He expected me to be 
able to transmit solid objects—” 
“Hold it, now,” I interrupted 
again. “That’s what I would have 
expected, too. You mean your 
gadget won’t—” 

“Of course not.” 

“Then what the hell . Pardon 
me. What does it transmit?” 
“Matter, of course!” he said. 
“That’s all any sane person would 
expect!” He was beginning to boil 
now. “Take this glass, for instance. 
Its shape is the end result of a 
number of factors — structural 
stresses, chemical bonds, surface 
tension — forming a three-dimen- 
sional spatial pattern. None of that 
is electrical, so how can you expect 
to transmit it?” 

“Damned if I know,” I confessed. 
“You’re the genuis. What do you 
send?” 

‘•Molecules, of course,” he said 
witheringly, as if I should have 
known that for myself. “The ap- 
plied field breaks down the ma- 
terial form into its elementary 
molecules — dispersing all the 
mechanico-chemical components— 
and then the molecules, which are 
purely electronic values, are con- 
verted into radio-type patterns. 



These are transmitted, and re- 
ceived, reconverted, in the receiv- 
ing unit. You see?” 

“So,” I said, “if you shoved this 
glass into your gadget, it would 
come out at the other end as a 
heap of silica and stuff?” 

“That’s right.” He nodded. 
“Only I’d have to powder the 
glass first. My apparatus doesn’t 
develop a field strong enough to 
break down a structure as rigid as 
this.” 

“That’s a pity.” I put down the 
glass. “For a moment there, I 
thought you had maybe the mak- 
ings of a distintegrator.” 

‘What’s a disintegrator?” 
“You’re strictly a one-idea man, 
aren’t you, Arthur? A disintegra- 
tor is something you don’t see 
which makes something you do 
see into something you don’t see. 
See?” He didn’t, of course, and I 
was wasting my time. “But,” I 
went on to point out, “your gadget 
is crazier than that. Who’d want 
to send a pinch of powder any- 
where?” 

“That was Mr. Ferdinand’s com- 
plaint,” he mumbled sorrowfully. 
“He was expecting something quite 
different — and he used the same 
words. ‘Pinch of dust!’ he said. 
‘What’s the use of that? I can do 
better with ordinary television. At 
least I can send and receive a rec- 
ognizable picture!’ So we got into 
an argument and he sacked me.” 
And it happened! Again! A real 



IDEA MAN 



163 



H-bomb of an idea this time — so 
big that it scared me stiff, and all 
my brakes went on full. 

“Arthur,” I said very softly. 
“Arthur Penfold, I think I’ve got 
the solution to your problem, but 
I want to be absolutely sure before 
I get your hopes up. Let me ask a 
few questions. First, do you still 
have the gadget? I mean, in full 
working order — and it’s all yours 
— not made of spare parts from the 
firm, or anything like that?” 

H E went a shade of pink that 
would have alarmed a doc- 
tor. “Damn right it’s all mine, and 
in working order! I have it at home, 
in my back room, just as Mr. Ferdi- 
nand saw it! Why?” 

“And I can see it with my own 
eyes?” I asked urgently. 

“I don’t see why not.” He began 
to catch something of the fever 
that was burning me. “I say, do 
you think there’s anything impor- 
tant about it? Mr. Ferdinand 
didn’t seem to think very much of 
it-” 

“That’s what I’m counting on, 
Arthur. You see, I think I have the 
order of events right this time. 
This -is a stupendous idea and 
somebody else has had first crack 
at it and slipped up — so it’s my 
turn to come in second and reap 
the harvest. This time it can’t go 
wrong!” 

He looked dubious. “I don’t see 
what’s so wonderful about it. An 



interesting phenomenon, yes — and 
possible developments, perhaps — 
but what’s your bright idea — er, 
I beg your pardon. No offense, I 
hope?” 

“Think nothing of it.” I brushed 
it to one side. “I’m used to that. 
The idea? It’s big — biggest thing 
I ever fell into, but this time I’m 
going to play it carefully.^ This time 
I’m digging out the snags first, if 
there are any — and that’s all I’m 
going to say until I’ve actually 
seen this thing with my own two 
eyes.” 

So we went, by bus, and I saw. 
His stuff was all scrambled about, 
crazily, in a stuffy back room that 
was a death trap of looping wires, 
naked terminals, milk bottles by 
the dozen, and several Pisa-like 
stacks of slices of stale bread. Pen- 
fold, with apologies, explained that 
he used milk bottles as collector 
units, because they were all of a 
standard size, and bread as his 
experimental transmission ma- 
terial because it was cheap, handy 
and the right kind of texture. 

And he showed me. I’m no 
genius at electronics, but you have 
to know a smattering in my line, 
so I could recognize transformers 
and coils — some really tortuous 
ones, in vacuum tubes — and a 
mess of wiring that tangled my 
eyes just to look at. But the thing 
that really mattered — the focal 
point, as it were — was on the end 
of the bench, and it looked exactly 



164 



GALAXY 



like an old-fashioned fishbowl. It 
was a fishbowl, with a copper-wire 
tripod inside, and some trimmings, 
connected to the rest of the hook- 
up. 

“Watch!” he said, switching 
things on here and there. After a 
few clicks and a hum or two, I saw 
a bright blue haze spread itself 
like a little table cloth on the tri- 
pod. He took a slice of bread and 
crumbled it into the bowl, and it 
fizzed a little, then lay in a thin 
layer, on the blue haze. And that 
was that. 

“It hasn’t gone anywhere,” I 
observed, and he snorted. 

“Of course it hasn’t. There isn’t 
anywhere for it to go!” 

“But in all the stories, it just 
vanishes — and there it is, presto, 
in the cabinet thing. Where’s your 
cabinet?” 

“Fiction! Look here—” There 
was quite a transformation in Ar- 
thur now. This was his stamping 
ground and he was thoroughly dis- 
gusted with my ignorance. “Let me 
make this quite clear, Bright. This 
is not radio, although analogous 
to it in many ways — frequency 
and wave-length characteristics, 
for instance. But in other ways it 
resembles ordinary, everyday elec- 
tric current . .” 

TT E launched into a highly tech- 
nical exposition, which didn’t 
do anything for me at all, and it 
must have showed on my face, be- 



cause, after a few minutes, he 
switched off. 

“Oh, dear,” he sighed. “Look, sup- 
pose I took a length of insulated 
wire, bared one end, and stuck it 
in that socket there — what would 
happen?” 

“There would be a big blue flash 
and all the lights would go out?” 

“No! Good gracious, don’t you 
know anything? Nothing would 
happen — nothing at all — until I 
grounded the other end. The juice 
must have somewhere to go. It’s 
the same with this. The molecular 
substance cannot go anywhere un- 
til I provide it with a ground.” 

He was talking to me like a 
child now, which was a laugh, as 
there was enough of me to make 
four of him, easy — but I didn’t 
mind. I was watching what he did. 
He took a dinky little gadget out 
of a drawer and fitted it on to the 
top of a milk bottle. It looked like 
shiny black bakelite, like a collar, 
and there was a fine wire grid 
across the hole, and a button on 
the side. 

“Now watch!” he said, and 
pressed the button. There was a 
quiet sizzle, and the bottle was 
about one-third full of a fine white 
mist. It began to settle. And die 
bread crumbs had gone from the 
fish bowl, from one end of the 
bench to the other, without any 
visible connection. All of six feet. 

It looked all right. But I was 
cautious.

“I’d like to see that again ” I 
told him. 

Then I was in trouble. I wanted 
to have the “go” and the “come 
back” effects properly separated, 
and to watch them both at the 
same time. It couldn’t be done. In 
the end, I had to compromise. I 
put the bread crumbs in by myself, 
and I held the milk bottle, and 
switched on the collector by my- 
self — with him by my side all the 
time — and it still worked. 

Still with my brakes on, I asked, 
“But how do you know it will 
work with anything else? Have 
you tried?’ 

“What did you have in mind?” 
he asked. 

“A piece of coal, for instance.” 

Well, he looked at me as if I’d 
lost my mind, but we did it. 
Chunk of coal in there — black 
haze of molecular carbon and stuff 
out here, among the bread powder. 
I began to ache with the effort to 
hold back my enthusiasm. This 
was it. all right. I couldn’t find a 
thing wrong with it. But hold on a 
bit . 

“How about liquids?” I de- 
manded, and he was puzzled for a 
minute. 

“Shouldn’t make any differ- 
ence,” he decided, and came back 
with a jug of water. 

I came right up on my toes with 
fright as he sloshed about half a 
pint into the bowl, all over that 
power-haze — but nothing hap- 



pened. It just lay there, in mid-air, 
quietly. 

Before I could get my breath 
back, he said, “We can try it at a 
slightly longer range, if you like. I 
have only a limited power source, 
but it should carry as far as the 
next room, at least.” And he 
marched out of his clutter, with me 
hot-footing after him. Standing in, 
his little bed-sitting room, I 
thought of that power angle. 

“That’s a point!” I said. “It uses 
a hell of a lot of wattage, doesn’t 
it?” 

T"h AMN it, there had to be a 
” snag somewhere — it was too 
good. But he shook his head gently. 

“No. So far as I can detect, there 
is almost no power drain on the 
transmission. There is a hefty 
power investment in setting up the 
original field, of course, but it is all 
returned when the field is broken 
down again. As a matter of fact, 
that was one of my biggest trou- 
bles. I had no way of handling all 
that return current—” 

“Never mind,” I told him. “Not 
now — I can’t bear it. Just let me 
try this last experiment.” 

I grabbed the bottle from him 
and pressed the button. Immedi- 
ately, I had a bottle full of gray- 
black mud, which filled up and 
lifted off the collector collar. It 
fizzed down to the floor, jetting a 
spurt of fine mist, and I stood there 
with the filthy stuff drooling down 



166

over my hands — and I gloated. 

He began to go off excitedly 
about something, and it was quite 
a while before I realized just what. 

“The hell with the carpet, man!” 
I cried. “What does a carpet mat- 
ter when you have the world in 
your lap? Wealth, fame, prestige, 
power — all shall be yours, Arthur! 
Just let me handle this and you’ll 
be a hero of science — a Nobel 
Prize-winner — an immortal!” 

But he kept right on about that 
lousy carpet, and what his land- 
lady would say, and it took me a 
lot of work to get him to sit down 
and listen — and to promise, first, 
that he would let me be the mas- 
ter mind in charge. Then I wrapped 
it all up in one word and gave it 
to him: 

Rockets! 

Now it was his turn to look blank 
and for me to feel superior, but I 
hadn’t time for that. I had to get 
it across to him — to sell it. 

“Listen, I said. “Preparations are, 
being made for a manned satellite, 
and then a Moon trip, a trip to 
Venus, Mars — and who’s doing it 
all? America and Russia. Why? 
Because rocketry is a super-co- 
lossal-expensive business. Why is 
Britain out of it? Because we can’t 
afford it. Do we want to be in on 
it? Of course we do. Even Royalty 
has been heard to express some 
concern because Britain is lagging 
behind. Isn’t that so?” 

He had to nod there, because it 



was all true, but he was puzzled. 

“What does this have to do with 
rocketry?” he mumbled. 

“You know what the biggest 
headache is in rocketry? It’s fuel! 
A rocket just devours fuel — and 
it has to lift and carry all its fuel 
with it, and fuel is weight — and 
the more fuel you carry, the more 
weight you carry, and the more 
fuel you need to lift the weight, 
until it takes more fuel to lift the 
weight of fuel than you have fuel 
to lift the weight. Are you getting 
the picture now?” 

“That part, yes. But what does 
my— 

“This gadget of yours will end 
that. No need to design for fuel 
tanks at all any more — or to al- 
low for the weight of it! You trans- 
mit it as required! Can you imag- 
ine it? And it’s for Britain, boy! 
This will put us away out in front 
in the space race. Just wait until 
the Space Travel Commission 
hears of this, or the Interplanetary 
Exploration Board, or the Rocket 
Experimental Office, or whatever 
they all it. Just wait — you’ll see 
their eyes light up!” 

YVT ELL, we had ourselves a 
** great evening, I can tell you. 
But the weeks that followed were 
such as try the soul. Would you 
believe it, there isn’t a Space 
Travel Commission, or an Inter- 
planetary Exploration Board, or 
anything like it in this benighted

country? There isn’t even an au- 
thorized body for carrying out 
rocket tests! So far as I could make 
out, the only people doing any- 
thing with rockets are the firework 
manufacturers. And the civil law- 
well, I’d rather not dwell on that, 
if you don’t mind. There was only 
the military left — and who wants 
to tangle with them in any 
country? 

But that’s what it came to in 
the end. We were out of money, 
for one thing. I soon ran through 
my little pile, and Penfold didn’t 
have much — we were both out of 
a job, remember. So I had to go 
ask Joyce for a loan. I didn’t have 
much hope of her, but she sur- 
prised me. She had managed to 
hang on to her rights and was tak- 
ing a sizeable percentage of the 
window-model business. She 
wouldn’t lend money, though. She 
bought into Penfold instead. And 
I thought she was stupid! 

And, at last, the day came. We 
had kept everything as hush-hush 
as possible, but you can’t kill ru- 
mors about such things as the veri- 
fied and signed experimental trans- 
mission of five hundred gallons of 
fuming nitric acid from one end 
to the other of a carefully watched 
and guarded air strip somewhere 
in the West Country. 

So we foregathered with a very 
impressed, and impressive, com- 
mittee of VIPs — lots of gold braid, 
oak leaves, eggheads, senior civil 



servants, and a cabinet minister or 
two, plus a swarm of experts and 
consultants — and Penfold and me. 

It had been tested and consid- 
ered and debated ad nauseam, and 
this was the final formality. The 
Government was going to buy 
rights in our very nice baby and 
nurse it for us. We were made! 

We all sat ourselves at a long 
table, ready to work ourselves 
tired signing a lot of papers. 

An undersecretary of some kind 
began serving out sheafs of forms 
to all and sundry. There was a 
barrage of rustling, coughing, spec- 
tacle-case poppings — lips moved 
and twitched silently — mutterers 
muttered. Somebody walloped the 
table with a gavel. We came to 
order.. 

Then a beefy, red-faced mer- 
chant got up, not far from me, 
with a funny look on his face. 

“My Lord—” he said, then 
coughed. “I beg your pardon — Mr. 
Chairman.” It was a gaffe, the kind 
of procedural gaffe you don’t hear 
at a meeting like this, and it had 
everyone by the ear in a minute. 
Dead silence. “May I draw atten- 
tion to page three, second para- 
graph, of the proposal, wherein 
there is a definitive description of 
Mr. Penfold’s device?” He 
hemmed a couple of times, and 
then read carefully, “—hum— hum- 
operating by the transmission of 
molecular energies between two 
termini in harmonic correspon-

dence with each others; i.e., match- 
ing in frequency and wave length, 
in a manner analogous with con- 
ventional long-wave radio trans- 
mission and reception—” 

He stopped to clear his throat 
“I would emphasize the term 
‘long-wave’—” 

You could have cut the quiet 
with a cleaver. 

Then he said, “If I may ask — 
what about the Heaviside Layer?” 
It was murder. Because of the 
Geophysical Year, even I had 
heard of the Heaviside Layer and 
Van Allen radiation belts and the 
like, and I knew that long-wave 
stuff bounces off — it doesn’t go 
through. I got a momentary flash 
of our rocket bellowing up and 
going phut — out of juice, just 
beyond the ionosphere — and I 
wanted to die right there. Lord 
knows why I had taken it for 
granted that Penfold’s stuff was 
ultra-short-wave, but I had, and 
so had everybody else, until red- 
face spotted it. 

T T was the end, of course. All 
-*■ over. I believe they shooed us 
out gently. I’m not too sure. I was 
too ruined, mentally, to take much 
notice. 

The next clear memory I have 
is of Penfold and me slumped in a 
little pub, just the other side of 
Admiralty Arch, wondering what 
had hit us. The way Penfold was 
looking at me, I could see that it 



was going to happen again. It was 
going to be all my fault. 

But just as he was drawing a 
big breath, ready to let fly, we 
were interrupted by a tall, thin 
guy, with a hairline mustache, 
slick hair, and the kind of suit you 
see only in Bond Street ads. 

“May I join you?” he asked, and 
sat, all in one motion. “I was a 
member of that committee. I’m 
sorry it all came to nothing. It 
must have been a severe blow for 
you chaps.” 

“A blow?” Penfold sounded as 
if he might cry any minute. “The 
blow happened when I first met 
him! I should never have listened 
to a word he said. I don’t know 
what I shall do now. I’m out of a 
job, broke, in debt, disgraced, my 
professional reputation ruined—” 
“I’m sorry,” the stranger said. 
“Perhaps I can help. My name is 
Parker. I think your idea has pos- 
sibilities, Mr. Penfold. Of course, 
it will need a lot of work done on 
it, and modifications. I think you 
need a new partner, perhaps, and 
some financial backing. I would 
like to buy in.” 

“Nothing to buy,” I told him bit- 
terly. “He says he’s in debt. That’s 
a laugh. I’m the one who’s gone 
into hock for this thing!” 

“Very well,” he said. “What 
would it take to cover your debts, 
plus a little something for your 
trouble, in return for your share?” 
“Well, now—” I thought, fast. 



IDEA MAN 



169 



“Five hundred will get me out of 
the red— and, say, a thousand for 
my share?” 

Penfold’s eyes nearly bugged 
out of their sockets at this. “A 
thousand pounds?” he screamed. 
“You have the cheek to ask this 
man — ' a perfect stranger — to give 
you a thousand pounds for noth- 
ing?” 

But Parker wasn’t paying him 
any attention. He was busy with a 
very nice-looking cheque book. I 
had one little quiver of uncer- 
tainty as I put out my hand for 
that pretty slip of paper — but it 
died, and I took it. And I cashed 
it- 

And that’s the last I ever saw 
of Arthur Penfold. That was three 
years ago. You know the rest. He 
belongs to the world ifow. Every- 
body has heard of tjte Penfold- 
Parker Power Pack.

WTTHY didn’t I think of it? Why 
” didn’t I remember that cars, 
lorries, trucks, motorbikes, buses, 
trains, diesel engines, aircraft and 
motorboats — and big liners — all 
use fuel? You know how it is now. 



You hire a Power Pack, with a 
meter on it — you clip it on to the 
fuel feed of your car or whatever 
— and you pay what it reads on the 
meter, the end of the month, into 
your nearest Penfold-Parker office. 
There’s one in every large town, 
here and overseas. Pretty soon the 
only engines with fuel tanks will 
be those in the museums. 

Why didn’t I think of it? 

Ideas— I’ve got a million of ’em, 
as Durante used to say. For in- 
stance, if you live all alone, as I 
do, you’ll know what it is to want 
to heat up a tin of beans. You have 
to mess about with a pan, waste 
time heating up the water. There’s 
no need. Just punch a small hole 
in the top of the tin, stick a bit 
of cellophane tape over it, and put 
the tin on a single flame. When the 
heat and pressure are right, the 
tape will burst. Pressure-cooker 
principle, get me? 

You don’t? You’d rather have 
a girl like Joyce cook for you? 
Funny, so did Arthur — he married 
her. 

Now why didn’t I think of that?

T AKE a fellow, reasonably 
young, personable enough, 
health perfect. Suppose he 
has all the money he can reason- 
ably, or even unreasonably, use. He 
is successful in a number of dif- 
ferent fields of work in which he is 
interested. Certainly he has securi- 
ty. Women? Well, maybe not any 
woman in the world he might want. 
But still, a very nice, choice selec- 
tion of a number of the very finest 
physical specimens. The finest — 
and no acute case of puritanism to 
inhibit his enjoyment. 

Take all that. Then add to it the 
positive assurance of continuing 
youth and vigor, with a solid life 
expectancy of from 175 to 200 
more years. Impossible? Well — 
just suppose it were all true of 
someone. A man like that, a man 
with all those things going for him, 
you’d figure he would be the hap- 
piest man in the world. 

Wouldn’t you? 

Sure. A man with all that would 
have to be the happiest — unless he 
was crazy. Right? But me, Johnny 
Barth, I had it 

I had all of it, just like that. I 
sure wasn’t the happiest man in 
the world though. And I know I 
wasn’t crazy either. The thing 
about me was, I wasn’t a man. Not 
exactly. 

I was a colony. 

Really. A colony. A settlement. 
A new but flourishing culture, you 
might say. Oh, I had the look of

a man, and the mind and the nerves 
and the feel of a man too. All the 
normal parts and equipment. But 
all of it existed — and was beauti- 
fully kept up, I’ll say that — pri- 
marily as a locale, not a man. 

I was, as I said before, a colony. 

Sometimes I used to wonder how 
New England really felt about the 
Pilgrims. If you think that sounds 
silly — perhaps one of these days 
you won’t. 

T^HE beginning was some ten 
years back, on a hunting trip 
the autumn after I got out of col- 
lege. That was just before I started 
working, as far off the bottom as I 
could talk myself, which was the 
personnel office in my Uncle John’s 
dry cleaning chain in the city. 

That wasn’t too bad. But I was 
number four man in the office, so 
it could have been better, too. 
Uncle John was a bachelor, which 
meant he had no daughter I could 
marry. Anyway, she would have 
been my cousin. But next best, I 
figured, was to be on good personal 
terms with the old bull. 

This wasn’t too hard. Apart from 
expecting rising young executives 
to rise and start work no later than 
8:30 a.m., Uncle John was more or 
less all right. Humor him? Well, 
every fall he liked to go hunting. So 
when he asked me to go hunting 
with him up in the Great Sentries, 
I knew I was getting along pretty 
well. I went hunting. 

174 



The trip was nothing very much. 
We camped up in the hills. We 
drank a reasonably good bourbon. 
We hunted — if that’s the word for 
it. Me, I’d done my hitch in the 
Army. I know what a gun is — and 
respect it. Uncle John provided 
our hunting excitement by turning 
out to be one of the trigger-happy 
types. His score was two cows, a 
goat, a couple of other hunters, one 
possible deer — and unnumbered 
shrubs and bushes shot at Luckily 
he was such a lousy shot that the 
safest things in the mountains were 
his targets. 

Well, no matter. I tried to stay 
in the second safest place, which 
was directly behind him. So it was 
a nice enough trip with no casual- 
ties, right up to the last night. 

We were all set to pack out in 
the morning when it happened. 
Maybe you read about the thing at 
the time. It got a light-hearted play 
in the papers, the way those things 
do. “A one in a billion accident,” 
they called it. 

We were lounging by the camp- 
fire after supper and a few good 
snorts. Uncle John was entertain- 
ing himself with a review of some 
of his nearer, more thrilling misses. 
I, to tell the truth, was sort of doz- 
ing off. 

Then, all of a sudden, there was 
a bright flash of blue-green light 
and a loud sort of a “zoop-zing” 
sound. And a sharp, stinging sensa- 
tion in my thighs. 

GALAXY 



I hollered. I jumped to my feet 
I looked down, and my pants were 
peppered with about a dozen little 
holes like buckshot. I didn’t have 
to drop my pants to know my legs 
were too. I could feel it. And blood 
started to ooze. 

I figured, of course, that Uncle 
John had finally shot me and I at 
once looked on the bright side. I 
would be a cinch for a fast promo- 
tion to vice president. But Uncle 
John swore he hadn’t been near a 
gun. So we guessed some other hun- 
ter must have done it, seen what he 
had done and then prudently 
ducked. At least no one stepped 
forward. 

TT was a moonlight night. With 
*- Uncle John helping me we 
made it the two and a half miles 
back down the trail to Poxville, 
where we’d left our car and stuff. 
We routed out the only doctor in 
the area, old Doc Grandy . 

He grumbled, “Hell, boy, a few 
little hunks o’ buckshot like that 
and you make such a holler. I see a 
dozen twice’s bad as this ever’ sea- 
son. Ought to make you wait till 
office hours. Well — hike yourself 
up on the table there. I’ll flip ’em 
out for you.” 

Which he proceeded to do. If it 
was a joke to him, it sure wasn’t to 
me, even if they weren’t in very 
deep. Finally he was done. He 
stood there clucking like an old 
hen with no family but a brass door- 
INSIDE JOHN BARTH 



knob. Something didn’t seem quite 
right to him. 

Uncle John gave me a good belt 
of the bourbon he’d been thought- 
ful enough to pack along. 

“What was it you say hit you, 
boy?” Doc Grandy wanted to 
know, reaching absently for the 
bottle. 

“Buckshot, I suppose. What was 
it you just hacked out of me?” 
“Hah!” He passed the bottle 
back to Uncle John. “Not like any 
buckshot I ever saw. Little balls, 
or shells of metallic stuff all right. 
But not lead. Peculiar. M-mph. 
You know what, boy?” 

“You’re mighty liberal with the 
iodine, I know that. What else?” 
“You say you saw a big flash of 
light. Come to think on it, I saw a 
streak of light up the mountain- 
side about that same time. I was 
out on the porch. You know, boy, 
I believe you got something to feel 
right set up about. I believe you 
been hit by a meteor. If it weren’t 
— ha-ha — pieces of one of them fly- 
ing saucers you read about.” 

Well, I didn’t feel so set up about 
it, then or ever. But it did turn out 
he was right. 

Doc Grandy got a science pro- 
fessor from Eastern State Teachers 
College there in Poxville to come 
look. He agreed that they were 
meteor fragments. The two of them 
phoned it in to the city papers 
during a slow week and, all in all, 
it was a big thing. To them. To 

175 



me it was nothing much but a pain 
in the rear. 

The meteor, interviewed scien- 
tists were quoted as saying, must 
have almost burned up coming 
through the atmosphere, and dis- 
integrated just before it hit me. 
Otherwise I’d have been killed. 
The Poxville professor got very 
long-winded about the peculiar 
shape and composition of the 
pieces, and finally carried off all but 
one for the college museum. Most 
likely they’re still there. One I kept 
as a souvenir, which was silly. It 
wasn’t a thing I wanted to remem- 
ber — or, as I found later, would 
ever be able to forget. Anyway, I 
lost it. 

All right. That was that and, ex- 
cept for a lingering need to sit on 
very soft cushions, the end of it. 
I thought. We went back to town. 

Uncle John felt almost as guilty 
about the whole thing as if he had 
shot me himself and, in November, 
when he found about old Bert Win- 
ginheimer interviewing girl appli- 
cants for checker jobs at home in 
his apartment, I got a nice promo- 
tion. 

W ORKING my way up, I was a 
happy, successful businessman. 
And then, not all at once but 
gradually, a lot of little things 
developed into problems. They 
weren’t really problems either, ex- 
actly. They were puzzles. Nothing 
big but— well, it was like I was sort 
176 



of being made to do, or not do, cer- 
tain things. Like being pushed in 
one direction or another. And not 
necessarily the direction I person- 
ally would have picked. Like- 

Well, one thing was shaving. 

I always had used an ordinary 
safety razor — nicked myself not 
more than average. It seemed OK 
to me. Never cared too much for 
electric razors; it didn’t seem to 
me they shaved as close. But — I 
took to using an electric razor now, 
because I had to. 

One workday morning I dragged 
myself to the bathroom of my 
bachelor apartment to wash and 
shave. Getting started in the morn- 
ing was never a pleasure to me. But 
this time seemed somehow tougher 
than usual. I lathered my face and 
put a fresh blade in my old razor. 

For some reason, I could barely 
force myself to start. “Come on, 
Johnny boy!” I told myself. “Let’s 
go!” I made myself take a first 
stroke with the razor. Man! It 
burned, like fire. I started another 
stroke and the burning came before 
the razor even touched my face. I 
had to give up. I went down to the 
office without a shave. 

That was no good, of course, so 
at the coffee break I forced myself 
around the comer to the barber 
shop. Same thing! I got all lathered 
up all right, holding myself by force 
in the chair. But, before the barber 
could touch the razor to my face, 
the burning started again. 

GALAXY 



I stopped him. I couldn’t take it. 

And then suddenly the idea 
came to me that an electric razor 
would be the solution. It wasn’t, 
actually, just an idea; it was posi- 
tive knowledge. Somehow I knew 
an electric razor would do it. I 
picked one up at the drug store 
around the corner and took it to the 
office. Plugged the thing in and 
went to work. It was fine, as I had 
known it would be. As close a 
shave? Well, no. But at least it was 
a shave. 

Another thing was my approach 
to — or retreat from — drinking. 
Not that I ever was a real rummy, 
but I hadn’t been one to drag my 
feet at a party. Now I got so mod- 
erate it hardly seemed worth both- 
ering with at all. I could only take 
three or four drinks, and that only 
about once a week. The first time I 
had that feeling I should quit after 
four, I tried just one — or two — 
more. At the first sip of number 
five, I thought the top of my head 
would blast off. Four was the limit. 
Rigidly enforced. 

All that winter, things like that 
kept coming up. I couldn’t drink 
more than so much coffee. Had to 
take it easy on smoking. Gave up 
ice skating — all of a sudden the 
cold bothered me. Stay up late 
nights and chase around? No more; 
I could hardly hold my eyes open 
after ten. 

That’s the way it went. 

I had these feelings, compulsions 
INSIDE JOHN BARTH 



actually. I couldn’t control them. I 
couldn’t go against them. If I did, I 
would suffer for it. 

True, I had to admit that prob- 
ably all these things were really 
good for me. But it got to where 
everything I did was something 
that was good for me — and that 
was bad. Hell, it isn’t natural for a 
young fellow just out of college to 
live like a fussy old man of seventy 
with a grudge against the under- 
taker. Life became very dull! 

About the only thing I could say 
for it was, I was sure healthy. 

It was the first winter since I 
could remember that I never 
caught a cold. A cold? I never once 
sniffled. My health was perfect; 
never even so much as a pimple. 
My dandruff and athlete’s foot dis- 
appeared. I had a wonderful appe- 
tite — which was lucky, since I 
didn’t have much other recreation 
left. And I didn’t even gain weight! 

Well, those things were nice 
enough, true. But were they com- 
pensation for the life I was being 
forced to live? Answer: Uh-uh. I 
couldn’t imagine what was wrong 
with me. 

Of course, as it turned out the 
following spring, I didn’t have to 
imagine it. I was told. 

II 

TT was a Friday. After work I 
stopped by Perry’s Place with 
Fred Schingle and Burk Walters 

177 



from the main accounting office. I 
was hoping it would turn out to 
be one of my nights to have a 
couple— but no. I got the message 
and sat there, more or less sulking, 
in my half of the booth. 

Fred and Burk got to arguing 
about flying saucers. Fred said yes; 
Burk, no. I stirred my coffee and 
sat in a neutral corner. 

“Now look here,” said Burk, “you 
say people have seen things. All 
right. Maybe some of them have 
seen things — weather balloons, 
shadows, meteors maybe. But space 
ships? Nonsense.” 

“No nonsense at all. I’ve seen 
pictures. And some of the reports 
are from airline pilots and people 
like that, who are not fooled by 
balloons or meteors. They have 
seen ships, I tell you, ships from 
outer space. And they are observ- 
ing us.” 

“Drivel!” 

“It is not!” 

“It’s drivel. Now look, Fred. You 
too, Johnny, if you’re awake over 
there. How long have they been 
reporting these things? For years. 
Ever since World War II. 

“All right. Ever since the war, at 
least. So. Suppose they were space 
ships? Whoever was in them must 
be way ahead of us technically. So 
why don’t they land? Why don’t 
they approach us?” 

Fred shrugged. “How would I 
know? They probably have their 
reasons. Maybe they figure we 
178 



aren’t worth any closer contact.” 

“Hah! Nonsense. The reason we 
don’t see these space people, Fred 
my boy, admit it, is because there 
aren’t any. And you know it!” 

“I don’t know anything of the 
damned sort. For all any of us 
know, they might even be all 
around us right now.” 

Burk laughed. I smiled, a little 
sourly, and drained my coffee. 

I felt a little warning twinge. 

Too much coffee; should have 
taken milk. I excused myself as the 
other two ordered up another 
round. 

I left. The conversation was too 
stupid to listen to. Space creatures 
all around me, of all things. How 
wrong can a man get? There 
weren’t any invaders from space all 
around me. 

I was all around them. 

A LL at once, standing there on 
the sidewalk outside Perry’s 
Bar, I knew that it was true. Space 
invaders. The Earth was invaded— 
the Earth, hell! 7 was invaded. I 
didn’t know how I knew, but I knew 
all right. I should have. I was in 
possession of all the information. 

I took a cab home to my apart- 
ment. 

I was upset. I had a right to be 
upset and I wanted to be alone. 
Alone? That was a joke! 

Well, my cab pulled up in front 
of my very modest place. I paid 
the driver, overtipped him — I was 

GALAXY 



really upset — and ran up the stairs. 
In the apartment, I hustled to the 
two by four kitchen and, with un- 
shakable determination, I poured 
myself a four-finger snort of scotch. 

Then I groaned and poured it 
down the sink. Unshakable deter- 
mination is all very well— but when 
the top of your head seems to rip 
loose like a piece of stubborn ad- 
hesive coming off a hairy chest and 
bounces, hard, against the ceiling, 
then all you can do is give up. I 
stumbled out to the front room and 
slumped down in my easy chair to 
think. 

I’d left the door open and I was 
sitting in a draft. 

So I had to — that compulsion — 
go close the door. Then I sat down 
to think. 

Anyway I thought I sat down to 
think. But, suddenly, my thoughts 
were not my own. 

I wasn’t producing them; I was 
receiving them. 

“Barth! Oh, Land of Barth. Do 
you read us, oh Barthland? Do you 
read us?” 

I didn’t hear that, you under- 
stand. It wasn’t a voice. It was all 
thoughts inside my head. But to me 
they came in terms of words. 

I took it calmly. Surprisingly, I 
was no longer upset — which, as I 
think it over, was probably more 
an achievement of internal engi- 
neering than personal stability. 

“Yeah,” I said, “I read you. So 
who in hell—” a poor choice of ex- 
INSIDE JOHN BARTH 



pression — “are you? What are you 
doing here? Answer me that.” I 
didn’t have to say it, the thought 
would have been enough. I knew 
that. But it made me feel better to 
speak out. 

“We are Barthians, of course. We 
are your people. We live here.” 
“Well, you’re trespassing on 
private property! Get out, you hear 
me? Get out!” 

“Now, now, noble Fatherland. 
Please, do not become upset and 
unreasonable. We honor you great- 
ly as our home and country. Sure- 
ly we who were born and raised 
here have our rights. True, our fore- 
fathers who made the great voyage 
through space settled first here in 
a frightful wilderness some four 
generations back. But we are 
neither pioneers nor immigrants. 
We are citizens born.” 

“Invaders! Squatters!” 

“Citizens of Barthland.” 
“Invaded! Good Lord, of all the 
people in the world, why me? 
Nothing like this ever happened to 
anyone. Why did I have to be 
picked to be a territory — the first 
man to have queer things living in 
me?” 

“Oh, please, gracious Fatherland! 
Permit us to correct you. In the 
day of our fathers, conditions were, 
we can assure you, chaotic. Many 
horrible things lived here. Wild 
beasts and plant growths of the 
most vicious types were every- 
where.” 



179 



“There were—?” 

“What you would call microbes. 
Bacteria. Fungi. Viruses. Terrible 
devouring wild creatures every- 
where. You were a howling wilder- 
ness. Of course, we have cleaned 
those things up now. Today you are 
civilized— a fine, healthy individual 
of your species — and our revered 
Fatherland. Surely you have noted 
the vast improvement in your con- 
dition!” 

“Yes, but-” 

“And we pledge our lives to you, 
oh Barthland. As patriotic citizens 
we will defend you to the death. 
We promise you will never be suc- 
cessfully invaded.” 

Yeah. Well, that was nice. But 
already I felt as crowded as a sub- 
way train with the power cut out 
at rush hour. 

But there was no room for doubt 
either. I’d had it. I still did have it; 
had no chance at all of getting rid 
of it. 

"P HEY went on then and told me 
their story. 

I won’t try to repeat it all ver- 
batim. I couldn’t now, since my 
memory — but that’s something 
else. Anyway, I finally got the pic- 
ture. 

But I didn’t get it all the same 
evening. Oh, no. At ten I had to 
knock it off to go to bed, get my 
sleep, keep up my health. They 
were insistent. 

As they put it, even if I didn’t 
180 



care for myself I had to think about 
an entire population and genera- 
tions yet unborn. Or unbudded, 
which was the way they did it. 

Well, as they said, we had the 
whole weekend to work out an un- 
derstanding. Which we did. When 
we were through, I didn’t like it 
a whole lot better, but at least I 
could understand it. 

It was all a perfectly logical 
proposition from their point of view 
— which differed in quite a num- 
ber of respects from my own. To 
them it was simply a matter of sur- 
vival for their race and their cul- 
ture. To me it was a matter of who 
or what I was going to be. But then, 
I had no choice. 

According to the Official History 
I was given, they came from a tiny 
planet of a small sun. Actually, 
their sun was itself a planet, still 
incandescent, distant perhaps like 
Jupiter from the true sun. Their 
planet or moon was tiny, wet and 
warm. And the temperature was 
constant. 

These conditions, naturally, gov- 
erned their development — and, 
eventually, mine. 

Of course they were very small, 
about the size of a dysentery 
amoeba. The individual life span 
was short as compared to ours but 
the accelerated pace of their lives 
balanced it out. In the beginning, 
something like four of our days was 
a lifetime. So they lived, grew, de- 
veloped, evolved. They learned to 
GALAXY 




JUS IDE JOHN BARTH 



181 



communicate. They became civi- 
lized — far more so than we have, 
according to them. And I guess that 
was true. They were even able to 
extend their life span to something 
like two months. 

“And to what,” I inquired — but 
without much fire, I’m afraid; I was 
losing fight — “to what am I in- 
debted for this intrusion?” 

“Necessity.” 

It was, to them. Their sun had 
begun to cool. It was their eviction 
notice. 

They had to move or adapt 
themselves to immeasurably harsh- 
er conditions; and they had become 
so highly developed, so specialized, 
that change of that sort would have 
been difficult if not impossible. And 
they didn’t want to change, any- 
way. They liked themselves as 
they were. 

The only other thing was to es- 
cape. They had to work for flight 
through space. And they succeeded. 

There were planets nearer to 
them than Earth. But these were 
enormous worlds to them, and the 
conditions were intolerably harsh. 
They found one planet with con- 
ditions much like those on Earth 
a few million years back. It was a 
jungle world, dominated by giant 
reptiles — which were of no use to 
the folk. But there were a few, 
small, struggling, warm-blooded 
animals. Small to us, that is — they 
were county size to the folk. 

Some genius had a great inspira- 
182 



tion. While die environment of the 
planet itself was impossibly harsh 
and hostile, the conditions inside 
these warm little animals were 
highly suitable! 

It seemed to be the solution to 
their problem of survival. Small, 
trial colonies were established. 
Communication with the space 
ships from home was achieved. 

The experiment was a success. 

r T' HE trouble was that each col- 
ony^s existence depended on 
the life of the host. When the ani- 
mal died, the colony died. 

Life on the planet was savage. 
New colonies would, of course, be 
passed from individual to individ- 
ual and generation to generation of 
the host species. But the inevitable 
toll of attrition from the violent 
deaths pf the animals appalled this 
gentle race. And there was nothing 
they could do about it. They could 
give protection against disease, but 
they could not control the hosts. 
Their scientists figured that, if they 
could find a form of life having con- 
scious power of reason, they would 
be able to establish communica- 
tion and a measure of control. But 
it was not possible where only in- 
stinct existed. 

They went ahead because they 
had no choice. Their only chance 
was to establish their colonies, ac- 
cepting the certainty of the slaugh- 
ter of hundreds upon hundreds of 
entire communities — and hoping 
GALAXY 



that, with their help, evolution on 
the planet would eventually pro- 
duce a better host organism. Even 
of this they were by no means sure. 
It was a hope. For all they could 
know, the struggling mammalian 
life might well be doomed to ex- 
termination by the giant reptiles. 

They took the gamble. Hun- 
dreds of colonies were planted. 

They did it but they weren’t 
satisfied with it. So, back on the dy- 
ing home moon, survivors contin- 
ued to work. Before the end came 
they made one more desperate bid 
for race survival. 

They built interstellar ships to 
be launched on possibly endless 
journeys into space. A nucleus of 
select individuals in a spore-like 
form of suspended animation was 
placed on each ship. Ships were 
launched in pairs, with automatic 
controls to be activated when they 
entered into the radius of attrac- 
tion of a sun. Should the sun have 
planets such as their own home 
world — or Earth type — the ships 
would be guided there. In the case 
of an Earth type planet having in- 
telligent life, they would — 

They would do just what my 
damned “meteor” had done. 

They would home in on an indi- 
vidual, “explode,” penetrate — and 
set up heavy housekeeping on a 
permanent basis. They did. Love- 
ly. Oh, joy! 

Well. We would all like to see 
the Garden of Eden; but being it 
INSIDE JOHN BARTH 



is something quite else again. 
Me, a colony! 

My — uh — population had no 
idea where they were in relation 
to their original home, or how long 
they had traveled through space. 
They did hope that someplace on 
Earth their companion ship had es- 
tablished another settlement But 
they didn’t know. So far on our 
world, with, its masses of powerful 
electrical impulses, plus those of 
our own brains, they had found dis- 
tance communication impossible. 

“Well, look, fellows,” I said. 
“Look here now. This is a noble, 
inspiring story. The heroic strug- 
gle of your — uh — people to sur- 
vive, overcoming all odds and stuff, 
it’s wonderful! And I admire you 
for it, indeed I do. But — what 
about me?” 

“You, Great Land of Barth, are 
our beloved home and fatherland 
for many, many generations to 
come. You are the mighty base 
from which we can spread over this 
enormous planet.” 

“That’s you. What I mean is, 
what about me?” 

“Oh? But there is no conflict. 
Your interests are our interests.” 
That was how they looked at 
it. Sincerely. As they said, they 
weren’t ruthless conquerors. They 
only wanted to get along. 

A ND all they wanted for me 
were such fine things as good 
health, long life, contentment. Con- 

183 



tentment, sure. Continued irrita- 
tion — a sour disposition resulting 
in excess flow of bile — did not 
provide just the sort of environ- 
ment in which they cared to bring 
up the kiddies. Smoking? No. It 
wasn’t healthy. Alcohol? Well, they 
were willing to declare a national 
holiday now and then. Within 
reason. 

Which, as I already knew, meant 
two to four shots once or twice a 
week. 

OEX? Themselves, they didn’t 
^ have any. “But,” they told me 
with an attitude of broad tolerance, 
“we want to be fair. We will not 
interfere with you in this matter- 
other than to assist you in the use 
of sound judgment in the selection 
of a partner.” 

But I shouldn’t feel that any of 
this was in any way real restrictive. 
It was merely practical common 
sense. 

For observing it I would get their 
valuable advice and assistance in 
all phases of my life. I would en- 
joy — or have, anyway — perfect 
health. My life, if that’s what it 
was, would be extended by better 
than 100 years. “You are fortu- 
nate,” they pointed out, a little 
smugly I thought, “that we, unlike 
your race, are conservationists in 
the truest sense. Far from despoil- 
ing our homeland and laying waste 
its resources and natural scenic 
wonders, we will improve it.” 

184 



I had to be careful because, as 
they explained it, even a small nick 
with a razor might wipe out an en- 
tire suburban family. 

“But fellows! I want to live my 
own life.” 

“Come now. Please remember 
that you are not alone now.” 

“Aw, fellows. Look, I’ll get a dog, 
lots of dogs — fine purebreds, not 
mongrels like me. The finest. I’ll 
pamper them. They’ll live like 
kings . Wouldn’t you consider 
moving?” 

“Out of the question. 

“An elephant then? Think of the 
space, the room for the kids to 
play-” 

“Never.” 

“Damn it! Take me to— no, I 
mean let me talk to your leader.” 

That got me no place. It seemed 
I was already talking to their high- 
est government councils. All of my 
suggestions were considered, de- 
bated, voted on — and rejected. 

They were democratic, they 
said. They counted my vote in 
favor; but that was just one vote. 
Rather a small minority. 

As I suppose I should have fig- 
ured, my thoughts were coming 
through over a period that was, to 
them, equal to weeks. They re- 
corded them, accelerated them, 
broadcast them all around, held 
elections and recorded replies to 
be played back to me at my own 
slow tempo by the time I had a 
new thought ready. No, they 
GALAXY 



wouldn’t take time to let me count 
the votes. And there is where you 
might say I lost my self control. 

“Damn it!” I said. Or shouted. “I 
won’t have it! I won’t put up with 
it. I’ll — uh — I’ll get us all dead 
drunk. I’ll take dope! I’ll go out 
and get a shot of penicillin and—” 

I didn’t do a damned thing. I 
couldn’t. 

Their control of my actions was 
just as complete as they wanted to 
make it. While they didn’t exercise 
it all the time, they made the rules. 
According to them, they could have 
controlled my thoughts too if they 
had wanted to. They didn’t because 
they felt that wouldn’t be demo- 
cratic. Actually, I suppose they 
were pretty fair and reasonable — 
from their point of view. Certainly 
it could have been a lot worse. 

Ill 

T WASN’T as bad off as old 
-*■ Faust and his deal with the 
devil. My soul was still my own. 
But my body was community prop- 
erty — and I couldn’t, by God, so 
much as bite my own tongue with- 
out feeling like a bloody murderer 
— and being made to suffer for it, 
too. 

Perhaps you don’t think biting 
your tongue is any great privilege 
to have to give up. Maybe not. But, 
no matter how you figure, you’ve 
got to admit the situation was — 
well — confining. 

INSIDE JOHN BARTH 



And it lasted for over nine years. 

Nine miserable years of semi- 
slavery? Well, no. I couldn’t hon- 
estly say that it was that bad. There 
were all the restrictions and limi- 
tations, but also there was my per- 
fect health; and what you might 
call a sort of a sense of inner well- 
being. Added to that, there was my 
sensationally successful career. And 
the money. 

All at once, almost anything I 
undertook to do was sensationally 
successful. I wrote, in several dif- 
ferent styles and fields and under 
a number of different names; I was 
terrific. My painting was the talk 
of the art world. “Superb,” said the 
critics. “An astonishing other- 
worldly quality.” How right they 
were — even if they didn’t know 
why. I patented a few little inven- 
tions, just for fun; and I invested. 
The money poured in so fast I 
couldn’t count it. I hired people to 
count it, and to help guide it 
through the tax loopholes — 
although there I was able to give 
them a few sneaky little ideas that 
even our sharpest tax lawyers 
hadn’t worked out. 

Of course the catch in all that 
was that, actually, I was not so 
much a rich, brilliant, successful 
man. I was a booming, prosperous 
nation. 

The satisfaction I could take in 
all my success was limited by my 
knowledge that it was a group ef- 
fort. How could I help being suc- 



185 



cessful? I had a very fair part of 
the resources of a society substan- 
tially ahead of our own working 
for me. As for knowledge of our 
world, they didn’t just know every- 
thing I did. They knew everything 
I ever had known — or seen, heard, 
read, dreamed or thought of. They 
could dig up anything, explore it, 
expand it and use it in ways I 
couldn’t have worked out in a 
thousand years. Sure, I was suc- 
cessful. 1 did stay out of sports — 
too dangerous; entertainment — 
didn’t lend itself too well to the 
group approach; and music — they 
had never developed or used 
sound, and we agreed not to go into 
it. As I figured it, music in the soul 
may be very beautiful; but a full- 
size symphony in a sinus I could 
do without. 

So I had success. And there was 
another thing I had too. Company, 

Privacy? No, I had less privacy 
than any man who ever lived, al- 
though I admit that my people, as 
long as I obeyed the rules, were 
never pushy or intrusive. They 
didn’t come barging into my 
thoughts unless I invited them. But 
they were always ready. And if 
those nine years were less than 
perfect, at least I was never lone- 
some. Success, with me, was not a 
lonely thing. 

And there were women. 

Yes, there were women. And 
finally, at the end of it, there was 
a woman — and that was it. 



A S they had explained it, they 
were prepared to be tolerant 
about my — ah — relations with 
women as long as I was “reason- 
able” in my selection. Come to find 
out, they were prepared to be not 
just tolerant but insistent — and 
very selective. 

First there was Helga. 

Helga was Uncle John’s secre- 
tary, a great big, healthy, rosy- 
cheeked, blonde Swedish girl, ter- 
rific if you liked the type. Me, I 
hadn’t ever made a move in her 
direction, partly because she was 
so close to Uncle John, but mostly 
because my tastes always ran to 
the smaller types. But tastes can 
be changed. 

Ten days after that first conver- 
sation with my people I’d already 
cleared something like $50,000 in 
a few speculations in the commod- 
ity market. I was feeling a little 
moody in spite of it, and I decided 
to quit my job. So I went up that 
afternoon to Uncle John’s office to 
tell him. 

Uncle John was out Helga was 
in. There she was, five foot eleven 
of big, bouncy, blonde smorgas- 
bord. Wow! Before, I’d seen Helga 
a hundred times, looked with mild 
admiration but not one real ripple 
inside. And now, all at once, wow! 
That was my people, of course, 
manipulating glands, thoughts, 
feelings. “Wow!” it was. 

First things first “Helga, Doll! 
Ah! Where’s Uncle John?”

“Johnny! That’s the first time 
you ever called me — hm-m — Mr. 
Barth has gone for the day . 
Johnny” 

She hadn’t even looked at me 
before. My — uh — government 
was growing more powerful. It was 
establishing outside spheres of in- 
fluence. Of course, at the time, I 
didn’t take the trouble to analyze 
the situation; I just went to work 
on it. 

As they say, it is nice work if 
you can get it. 

I could get it. 

It was a good thing Uncle John 
didn’t come bustling back after 
something he’d forgotten that af- 
ternoon. 

I didn’t get around to quitting 
my job that afternoon. Later on 
that evening, I took her home. She 
wanted me to come in and meet 
her parents, yet! But I begged off 
that — and then she came up with 
a snapper. “But we will be married, 
Johnny darling. Won’t we? Real 
soon!” 

“Uh,” I said, making a quick 
mental plane reservation for Rio, 
“sure, Doll. Sure we will.” I broke 
away right quick after that. There 
was a problem I wanted to get a 
little advice on. 

What I did get, actually, was a 
nasty shock. 

Back in my apartment — my 
big, new, plush apartment — I sat 
down to go over the thing with the 
Department of the Interior. The 



enthusiastic response I got sur- 
prised me. “Magnificent,” was the 
word. “Superb. Great!” 

Well, I thought myself that I 
had turned in a pretty outstanding 
performance, but I hadn’t expected 
such applause. “It is a first step, a 
splendid beginning! A fully 
equipped, well-armed expedition 
will have the place settled, under 
cultivation and reasonably civil- 
ized inside of a day or two, your 
time. It will be simple for them. So 
much more so than in your case — 
since we now know precisely what 
to expect.” 

I was truly shocked. I felt guilty. 

“No!” I said. “Oh, no! What a 
thing to do. You can’tl” 

“Now, now. Gently,” they said. 
“What, after all, oh Fatherland, 
might be the perfectly natural con- 
sequences of your own act?” 

“What? You mean under other 
—that is—” 

“Exactly. You could very well 
have implanted a new life in her, 
which is all that we have done. 
Why should our doing so disturb 
you?” 

Well, it did disturb me. But 
then, as they pointed out, they 
could have developed less pleasant 
methods of spreading colonies. 
They had merely decided that this 
approach would be the surest and 
simplest. 

“Well, maybe,” I told them, “but 
it still seems kind of sneaky to me.

Besides, if you'd left it to me, I’d 
certainly never have picked a great 
big ox like Helga. And now she 
says she’s going to marry me, too!” 

“You do not wish this? We un- 
derstand. Do not be concerned. We 
will — ah — send instructions to 
our people the next time. She will 
change her feelings about this.” 

She dropped the marriage bit 
completely. 

We had what you might call an 
idyllic association, in spite of her 
being such a big, husky model — a 
fact which never bothered me 
when I was with her. “She is 
happy,” I was assured, “very 
happy.” She seemed pleased and 
contented enough, even if she de- 
veloped, I thought, a sort of an 
inward look about her. She and I 
never discussed our — uh — people. 
We had a fast whirl for a couple of 
weeks. And then I’d quit my job 
with Uncle John, and we sort of 
drifted apart. 

Next thing I heard of her, she 
married Uncle John. 

Well. 1 have my doubts about 
how faithful a wife she was to him, 
but certainly she seemed to make 
him happy. And my government 
assured me Uncle John was not 
colonized. “Too late,” they said. 
“He is too old to be worth the risk 
of settling.” But they respected my 
scruples about my uncle’s wife and 
direct communication with Helga- 
land was broken off. 

But there were others. 



OR the next nine years— things 
came easy for me. I suppose 
the restrictions, the lack of free- 
dom should have made me a lot 
more dissatisfied than I was. I 
know, though they didn’t say so, 
that my people did a little manip- 
ulating of my moods by jigger ing 
the glands and hormones or some- 
thing. It must have been that with 
the women. 

I know that after Helga I felt 
guilty about the whole thing. I 
wouldn’t do it again. But then one 
afternoon I was painting that big 
amazon of a model and — Wow! 

I couldn’t help it. So, actually, I 
don’t feel I should be blamed too 
much if, after the first couple of 
times, I quit trying to desert, so to 
speak. 

And time went by, although you 
wouldn’t have guessed it to look 
at me. I didn’t age. My health was 
perfect. Well, there were a couple 
of very light headaches and a 
touch of fever, but that was only 
politics. 

There were a couple of pretty 
tight elections which, of course, I 
followed fairly closely. After all, I 
had my. vote, along with everyone 
else and I didn’t want to waste it 
— even though, really, the political 
parties were pretty much the same 
and the elections were more ques- 
tions of personality than anything 
else.

GALAXY 



Then one afternoon I went to 
my broker’s office to shift around 
a few investments according to 
plans worked out the night before, 
I gave my instructions. Old man 
Henry Schnable checked over the 
notes he had made. 

“Now that’s a funny thing,” he 
said. 

“You think I’m making a mis- 
take?” 

“Oh, no. You never have yet. so 
I don’t suppose you are now. The 
funny tiling is tnat your moves 
here are almost exactly the same 
as those another very unusual cus- 
tomer of mine gave me over the 
phone not an hour ago.” 

“Oh?” There was nothing very 
interesting about that. But, oddly 
enough, I was very interested. 

“Yes. Miss Julia Reede. Only a 
child really, 21, but a brilliant girl. 
Possibly a genius. She comes from 
some little town up in the moun- 
tains. She has been in town here 
for just the past six months and 
her investments — well! Now I 
come to think about it, I believe 
they have very closely paralleled 
yours all along the line. Fabulously 
successful. You advising her?” 
“Never heard of the girl.” 

“Well, you really should meet 
her, Mr. Barth. You two have so 
much in common, and such lovely 
investments. Why don’t you wait 
around? Miss Reede is coming in 
to sign some papers this afternoon. 
You two should know each other.” 



H E was right. We should know 
each other. I could feel it. 
‘Well, Henry,” I said, “perhaps 
I will wait. I’ve got nothing else to 
do this afternoon.” 

That was a lie. I had plenty of 
things to do, including a date with 
the captain of a visiting women’s 
track team from Finland. Strangely, 
my people and I were in full agree- 
ment on standing up the chesty 
Finn, let the javelins fall where 
they may. 

Henry was surprised too. “You 
are going to wait for her? Uh. Well 
now, Mr. Barth, your reputation — 
ah — that is, she’s only a child, you 
know, from the country.” 

The buzzer on his desk sounded. 
His secretary spoke up on the in- 
tercom. “Miss Reede is here.” 

Miss Reede came right on in the 
door without waiting for a further 
invitation. 

We stood there gaping at each 
other. She was small, about 5'2" 
maybe, with short, black, curly 
hair, surface-cool green eyes with 
fire underneath, fresh, freckled 
nose, slim figure. Boyish? No. Not 
boyish. 

I stared, taking in every little 
detail. Every little detail was per- 
fect and — well, I can’t begin to 
describe it. That was for me. I 
could feel it all through me, she 
was what I had been waiting for, 
dreaming of. 

I made a quick call on the inside 
switchboard, determined to fight to 



INSIDE JOHN BARTH

override the veto I was sure was 
coming. I called. 

No answer. 

For the first time, I got no regu- 
lar answer. Of course, by now I 
always had a kind of a sense or 
feeling of what was going on. This 
time there was a feeling of a cele- 
bration, rejoicing, everybody on a 
holiday. Which was exactly the 
way I felt as I looked at the girl. 
No objections? Then why ask 
questions? 

“Julia,” old Henry Schnable was 
saying, “this is Mr. John Barth. 
John, this is — John! John, remem- 
ber—” 

I had reached out and taken the 
girl’s hand. I tucked her arm in 
mine and she looked up at me with 
the light, the fire in the green 
depths swimming toward the sur- 
face. I didn’t know what she saw 
in me — neither of us knew tnen — 
but the light was there, glowing. 
We walked together out of Henry 
Schnable’s office. 

“John! Julia, your papers! You 
have to sign—” 

Business? We had business else- 
where, she and I. 

“Where?” I asked her in the 
elevator. It was the first word ei- 
ther of us had spoken. 

“My apartment,” she said in a 
voice like a husky torch song. “It’s 
close. The girl who rooms with me 
is spending the week back home 
with her folks. The show she was in 
closed. We can be alone.” 




We could. Five minutes in a cab 
and we were. 

I never experienced anything 
remotely like it in all my life. I 
never will again. 

A ND then there was the time 
J - afterwards, and then we knew. 

It was late afternoon, turning to 
dusk. She lifted up on one elbow 
and half turned away from me to 
switch on the bedside lamp. The 
light came on and I looked down 
at her, lovingly, admiringly. Idly, 
I started to ask her, “How did you 
get those little scars on your leg 
there and . those little scars? 
Like buckshot! Julia! Once, along 
about ten years ago — you must 
have been a little girl then — in the 
mountains — sure. You were hit by 
a meteor, weren’t you??” 

She turned and stared at me. I 
pointed at my own little pockmark 
scars. 

“A meteor — about ten years 
ago!” 

“Oh!”’ 

“I knew it. You were.” 

“ ‘Some damn fool, crazy hunter,’ 
was what Pop said. He thought it 
really was buckshot. So did I, at 
first. We all did. Of course about 
six months later I found out what 
it was but we — my little people 
and I — agreed there was no sense 
in my telling anyone. But you 
know.” 

It was the other ship. There 
were two in this sector, each con- 



191 



trolled to colonize a person. My 
own group always hoped and be- 
lieved the other ship might have 
landed safely. And now they knew. 

We lay there, she and I, and we 
both checked internal communica- 
tions. They were confused, not 
clear and precise as usual. It was a 
holiday in full swing. The glorious 
reunion! No one was working. No 
one was willing to put in a lot of 
time at the communications center 
talking to Julia and me. They were 
too busy talking to each other. I 
was right. The other ship. 

Of course, since the other ship’s 
landfall had been a little girl then, 
the early movements of the group 
had been restricted. Expansion was 
delayed. She grew up. She came 
to the city. Then — well, I didn’t 
have to think about that. 

We looked at each other, Julia 
and I. A doll she was in the first 
place and a doll she still was. And 
then on top of that was the feeling 
of community, of closeness coming 
from our people. There was a sym- 
pathy. The two of us were in the 
same fix. And it may be that there 
was a certain sense of jealousy and 
resentment too — like the feeling, 
say, between North and South 
America. How did we feel? 

“I feel like a drink.” 

We said it together and laughed. 
Then we got up and got the drinks'. 
I was glad to find that Julia’s ab- 
sent roomate, an actress, had a 
pretty fair bar stock. 



W E had a drink. We had an- 
other. And a third. 

Maybe nobody at all was man- 
ning the inner duty stations. Or 
maybe they were visiting back and 
forth, both populations in a holi- 
day mood. They figured this was 
a once in a millenium celebration 
and, for once, the limits were off. 
Even alcohol was welcome. That’s 
a line of thought that kills plenty 
of people every day out on the 
highway. 

We had a couple more in a reck- 
less toast. I kissed Julia. She kissed 
me. Then we had some more 
drinks. 

Naturally it hit us hard; we 
weren’t used to it. But still we 
didn’t stop drinking. The limits 
were off for the first time. Probably 
it would never happen again. This 
was our chance of a lifetime and 
there was a sort of desperation in 
it. We kept on drinking. 

“Woosh,” I said, finally, “wow. 
Let’s have one more, wha’ say? 
One more them — an’ one more 
those.” 

She giggled. “Aroun’ an aroun’, 
whoop, whoop! Dizzy. Woozy. 
Oughta have cup coffee.” 

“Naw. Not coffee. Gonna have 
hangover. Take pill. Apsirin.” 

“Can -not! Can -not take pill. 
Won’ lemme. ’Gains talla rules.” 
“Can.” 

“Can -not.” 

“Can. No rules. Rule soff. Can. 
Apsirin. Cmon.”

Clinging to each other, we stum- 
bled to the bathroom. Pills? The 
roommate must have been a real 
hypochondriac. She had rows and 
batteries of pills. I knocked a bot- 
tle off the cabinet shelf. Aspirin? 
Sure, fancy aspirin. Blue, special. I 
took a couple. 

“Apsirin. See? Easy.” 

Her mouth made a little, red, 
round “O” of wonder. She took a 
couple. 

“Gosh! Firs’ time I c’d ever take 
a pill.” 

“Good. Have ’nother?” 

It was crazy, sure. The two of 
us were drunk. But it was more 
than that. We were like a couple 
of wild, irresponsible kids, out of 
control and running wild through 
the pill boxes. We reeled around 
the bathroom, sampling pills and 
laughing. 

“Here’s nice bottla red ones.” 

There was a nice bottle of red 
ones. I fumbled the top off the 
bottle and spilled the bright red 
pills bouncing across the white tile 
bathroom floor. We dropped to our 
knees after them, after the red 
pills, the red dots, the red, fiery 
moons, spinning suddenly, whirl- 
ing, twirling, racing across the 
white floor. And then it got dark. 
Dark, and darker and even the red, 
red moons faded away. 

Some eons later, light began to 
come back and the red moons, dim 
now and pallid, whirled languidly 
across a white ceiling. 



S OMEONE said, “He’s coming 
out of it, I think.” 

“Oh,” I said. “Ugh!” 

I didn’t feel good. I’d almost for- 
gotten what it was like, but I was 
sick. Awful. I didn’t particularly 
want to look around but I did, eyes 
moving rustily in their sockets. 
There was a nurse and a doctor. 
They were standing by my bed in 
what was certainly a hospital. 

“Don’t ask,” said the doctor. I 
wasn’t going to. I didn’t even care 
where I was, but he told me any- 
way, “You are in the South Side 
Hospital, Mr. Barth. You will be 
all right — which is a wonder, con- 
sidering. Remarkable stamina! 
Please tell me, Mr. Barth, what 
kind of lunatic suicide pact was 
that?” 

“Suicide pact?” 

“Yes, Mr. Barth. Why couldn’t 
you have settled for just one simple 
poison, hm-m? The lab has been 
swearing at you all day.” 

“Uh?" 

“Yes. At what we pumped from 
your stomach. And found in the 
girl’s. Liquor, lots of that — but 
then, why aspirin? Barbiturates we 
expect. Roach pellets are not un- 
usual. But aureomycin? Tranquil- 
izers? Bufferin? Vitamin B com- 
plex, vitamin C — and, finally, half 
a dozen highly questionable con- 
traceptive pills? Good Lord, man!” 
“It was an accident. The girl — 
Julia — ?” 

“You are lucky. She wasn’t.” 



INSIDE JOHN BARTH 



193 



“Dead?” 

“Yes, Mr. Barth. She is dead.” 

“Doctor, listen to me! It was 
an accident, I swear. We didn't 
know what we were doing. We 
were, well, celebrating.” 

“In the medicine cabinet, Mr. 
Barth? Queer place to be cele- 
brating! Well, Mr. Barth, you must 
rest now. You have been through 
a lot. It was a near thing. The 
police will be in to see you later.” 

With this kindly word the doc- 
tor and his silently disapproving 
nurse filed out of the room. 

The police? Julia, poor Julia — 
dead. 

Now what? What should I do? 
I turned, as always, inward for 
advice and instructions. “Folks! 
Why didn’t you stop me? Why did 
you let me do it? And now — what 
shall I do? Answer me, I say. 
Answer!” 

There was only an emptiness. 
It was a hollow, aching sensation. 
It seemed to me I could hear my 
questions echoing inside me with 
a lonely sound. 

I was alone. For the first time 
in nearly ten years, I was truly 
alone, with no one to turn to. 

They were gone! At last, after 
all these years, they were gone. I 
was free again, truly free. It was 



glorious to be free — wasn’t it? 

The sheer joy of the thing 
brought a tightness to my throat, 
and I sniffled. I sniffled again. My 
nose was stuffy. The tightness in 
my throat grew tighter and be- 
came a pain. 

I sneezed. 

Was this joy — or a cold coming 
on? I shifted uneasily on the hos- 
pital bed and scratched at an itch 
on my left hip. Ouch! It was a 
pimple. My head ached. My 
throat hurt. I itched. Julia was 
dead. The police were coming. I 
was alone. What should I do? 

“Nurse!” I shouted at the top 
of my voice. “Nurse, come here. I 
want to send a wira Rush. Urgent. 
To my aunt, Mrs. Helga Barth, 
the address is in my wallet. Say, 
‘Helga. Am desperately ill, repeat, 
ill. Please come at once. I must 
have help — from you.’ ” 

She’ll come. I know she will. 
They’ve got to let her. It was an 
accident, I swear, and I’m not too 
old. I’m still in wonderful shape, 
beautifully kept up. 

But I feel awful. 

Well — how do you suppose 
New England would feel today, if 
suddenly all of its inhabitants 
died?
