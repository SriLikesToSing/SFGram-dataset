WHADDYA READ? 

by H. L GOLD 



I f I had made my way into pro- 
fessional writing and editing via 
fandom, perhaps I would have more 
sympathy for Isaac Asimov’s well 
and simply written: “Science fiction 
tends to be lacking in, science these 
days ... I disapprove ... I think 
science fiction isn’t really fiction if 
it lacks science” . and Sam Mos- 
kowitz’s eldritch prose poem: “It is 
to be hoped that these examples 
(three stories of the early 1930’s) 
may make a significant enough im- 
pression so as to bring about not a 
substitution of this type of story for 
what is being written today, but ^n 
incorporation of the elements they 
contain into the main body of modem 
science fiction.” 

These words appeared in the Au- 
gust 1967 issue of Galaxy. If you 
were its editor, as I was for its first 
11 years, you would learn to trans- 
late these mild-seeming requests in- 
to fanese: “Science fiction ain’t got 
no more sensa wonda no more!” In 
short, let’s have stories like those of 
the 1930’s. 

I wasn’t a fan then. I was one 
of the writers of that period. And I 
can tell you that most of what others 
and I wrote then was pretty dread- 
ful. 

Want a typical specimen? Here is 
part of a footnote from my first pub- 
lished story, following two solid 
pages of pseudo-scientific dialogue: 
“Lanse placed the masses of the 
two suns as being nearly equal. 
Then, since we know that the vel- 
ocity of our sun was 18 miles per 



second before collision, and 169,000 
after, and the masses of the stars 
equal, we can use the following 
formula to find an indication to the 
result. 

“Let mj and m 2 equal the masses 
of the two stars; Vj and V£ the re- 
spective velocities before collision; 
Uj and U 2 the corresponding veloci- 
ties after collision: 
miVi+m 2 V 2 = niiUi+m 2 U 2 (where the 
velocities of the sun are known be- 
fore and after collision, and the 
masses assumed to be equal). 

“Consequently, the other star now 
travels at 18 mps in the opposite 
direction from which it came; this 
we know because, in collisions of 
perfectly elastic bodies, the momen- 
tum before collision equals momen- 
tum after collision. 

“The intervening hyperspace is 
accountable for the lack of a true 
catastrophe, and the terrific strain 
the formula indicates when the sun 
was reversed in its path, for the 
fourth-dimensional thrust.” 

I sn’t that awful? Worse yet, I had 
everything that ever lived, was 
living or would live all occupying the 
earth at the same time — which was 
typical of almost all these cosmic 
stories. And worse still, nobody, 
from the editor on down to the young 
Isaac of those days, noticed my cos- 
mic error: It was space that got 
warped, not hyperspace — whatever, 
if anything, that may turn out to be. 

Dr. Asimov notes that jt is almost 
impossible to make a good living out

of science fiction alone. He omits 
the fact that of the tens of thou- 
sands of writers in this country, only 
a tiny percentage earns $15,000 or 
more a year by writing of any kind. 
One fifth of that amount in the 
1930’s was a very good living. I can 
think of at least a dozen then and 
more now who qualify as full-time 
s-f writers making a good living. A 
dozen or two may not seem like 
much, but consider the fact that no 
more than a hundred or so writers 
supply all the s.f. at a given time. 
What he should have said is that 
it’s hard to earn a living by writing. 

To get back to what these two 
distinguished men, one a profession- 
al fan and the other an ex-fan pro- 
fessional, are asking for: 

Every editor in those primitive 
days demanded — and got — such 
story-stoppers as my footnote, which 
made s.f. so hard to write and hard- 
er to read. We plundered college text- 
books, newspapers, magazines for 
springboards, so that whenever we 
wrote, for example a time-travel 
story, we threw in the Lorenz-Fitz- 
gerald contraction just as a starter, 
then added the latest thinking on the 
matter — all of it such ho-ho-hokum 
as time being a stream that can be 
ridden up, down or sideways, or film 
footage that one could run forward 
or backward, or a spiral that could 
be ascended or descended, or — isn’t 
that enough? If you can’t imagine 
going through bunk like that every 
last time you started reading a story, 
try whole issues of those magazines. 
Not a random story here and there, 
but whole issues, just as you would 
have bought and read them then. 

But besides being expensive, it’s 
not necessary. You can find the old 
formula of hero vs villain in cosmic 
crime, cosmic disasters, cosmic mon- 
6 



sters from everywhere in the movies 
and TV of today, which follow the 
editorial requirements of the 1930’s 
as if there were no better, more 
modern ones. 

Of course there were good s.f. 
stories then, just as there are good 
s.f. movies now, but the proportion 
of good to bad is pitiful and dis- 
couraging. At least half of the rea- 
son is the witless demand for “ex- 
planations” — as if the audience 
weren’t willing to believe everything 
on the author’s say-so provided he 
offers a good story. Not only do 
these “explanations” hold up the ac- 
tion, they almost inevitably force 
something cosmic on the author. 

T here, I’ve stated my case against 
the 1930’s. Now let me state my 
case for the 1960 ’s, using the issue 
that bore the accusations of my es- 
teemed adversaries: 

Hawksbill Station by Robert Sil- 
verberg: “A late Cambrian land- 
scape,” said Barrett quietly. “This 
would be a geologist’s dream, except 
that geologrists don’t tend to become 
political prisoners, it seems. Out in 
front is the Appalachian Geosyn- 
cline. It’s a strip of rock a few hun- 
dred miles wide and a few thousand 
miles long, from the Gulf of Mexico 
to Newfoundland. To the east we’ve 
got the Atlantic. A little way to the 
west we’ve got the Inland Sea. Some- 
where two thousand miles to the 
west there’s the Cordilleran Geosyn- 
cline, that’s going to be California 
and Washington and Oregon some- 
day.” 

From Ginny Wrapped in the Sun 
by R. A. Lafferty: “Yes, I’ve got a 
multidimensional daughter, Minden. 
Also a neighbor who is either deep 
or murky. You keep feeding me 
snatches of that paper of yours so 

IF 




I suppose that you want to excite 
my curiosity about it. And the title 
— The Contingent Mutation. What 
is? Who is?” “We are, Dismas. We 
are contingent, conditional, tempor- 
ary, makeshift and improbable in 
our species .... The proposition of 
my paper is that man is descended, 
recently and by incredible mutation, 
from the most impossible of ances- 
tors, Xauenthropus or Xauen Man. 
The answer of that descent scares 
me.” “Minden, are you out of your 
mind? Where is the descent? Where 
is the mutation? . One look at 
Xauen, and everybody saw instantly 
that the Neanderthals and Grimaldi 
and Cro-Magnon were all close cou- 
sins of the same species — ourselves. 
They were the template, the master 
key. They unriddled every riddle. 
We saw why the chin or lack of chin 
was only a racial characteristic. We 
saw it all. There is nothing to dis- 
tinguish the Xauens from ourselves, 
except that their adults ‘were badly 
made ganglers, and probably un- 
healthy. The Xauens are modem 
men. They are ourselves.” 

The non-fact article Travelers 
Guide to MegaHouston, by H. H. 
Hollis, could be quoted from end to 
end, from Architecture to Zoology, 
including air-conditioning innova- 
tions, handling of smog and pollu- 
tion, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, 
in a brilliant extrapolation of the 
Houston Astrodome to MegaHouston. 

From The Being in the Tank by 
Ted Thomas: “Joe Beam said, ‘An 
ammonia and hydrazine environment 
below zero plus a gamma photon 
dosage rate of better than 40 mega- 
rands per hour, and there he stands 
like he’s admiring Niagara Falls. 
What is that thing?’ Kramer, Beam’s 
chief assistant, spoke up. ‘Don’t for- 
get the pressure. That atmosphere 



in there is down to something like 
ten to the minus fifth millimeters of 
mercury. Why doesn’t he explode?’ ” 
From The Great Stupids by Miri- 
am Allen deFord: “The year 2116: 
that was when suddenly every hu- 
man being in the world under 50 
years of age became completely un- 
able to reason. And only Daniel Vol- 
lard knew why” ... a proposition 
that Miss deFord answers with a 
slight bow to chemistry and sure 
knowledge of physiopsychology. 

From To Outlive Eternity by Poul 
Anderson: “The speed of light can 
be approached, but nobody possess- 
ing rest mass can quite attain it. 
Smaller and smaller grew the incre- 
ments of velocity by which Leonora 
Christene neared that impossible ulti- 
mate. Thus it might have seemed 
that the universe which her crew 
observed could not be distorted fur- 
ther. Aberration could, at most, dis- 
place a star 45°; Doppler effect 
might infinitely redden the light 
from astern, but could only double 
the frequency of light ahead. But 
there was no limit on tau, and that 
was the measure of change in per- 
ceived space and experienced time. 
Accordingly, there was no limit to 
the violet shift either; and the cos- 
mos fore and <aft could shrink 
toward a zero thickness wherein all 
the galaxies were crowded.” 

T he remarkable thing about these 
excerpts is that they are not a 
bit remarkable. They all come from 
the very same issue in which Asimov 
and Moskowitz made their condition- 
ed-reflex pleas. What am I proving? 
That Moskowitz and Asimov and 
their f-ainish colleagues do NOT read 
present-day science fiction. Pay 
them no heed. Modem s.f. is better 
than it ever was. — H. L. GOLD

H e entered the booth when his 
turn came and waited somewhat 
apprehensively for it to perform. The 
panel behind shut him in and ground 
tight. 

The interior was dark and unbear- 
ably hot, making sweat break out 
and stream down his body. Then the 
temperature dropped so precipitously 
that the moisture crystallized upon 
his skin and flaked away with the 



violence of his shivering. The air 
grew thick and bitter, then gaspingly 
rare. Light blazed, then faded into 
impenetrable black. A complete sonic 
spectrum of noise smote him, follow- 
ed by crushing silence. His nose re- 
acted to a gamut of irritation. He 
sneezed. 

Abruptly it was spring on a clover 
hillside, waft of nectar and hum of 
bumblebee. The air was refreshingly 
brisk. The booth had zeroed in on 
his metabolism.

“Ideotity?” a deceptively feminine 
voice inquired from nowhere, and a 
sign fished with the word printed in 
italics, English. 

“My name is Dillingham,” he said 
clearly, remembering his instructions. 
“I am a male mammalian biped 
evolved on planet Earth. I am ap- 
plying for admission to the School of 
Prosthodontics as an initiate of the 
appropriate level.” 

After a pause the booth replied 
sweetly: “Misinformation. You are a 
quadruped.” 

“Correction,” Dillingham said 
quickly. “I am evolved from quad- 
ruped.” He spread his hands and 
touched the wall. ‘Technically 
tetrapod, anterior limbs no longer 
employed for locomotion. Digits pos- 
sess sensitivity, dexterity — ” 

“Noted.” But before he could 
breathe relief, it had another objec- 
tion: “Earth planet has not yet 

achieved galactic accreditation. Ap- 
plication invalid.” 

“I have been sponsored by the 
Dental League of Electrolus,” he 
said. He saw already how far he 
would have gotten without that potent 
endorsement. 

“Verified. Provisional application 
granted. Probability of accep- 
tance after preliminary investigation: 
twenty-one per cent Fee: Thirteen 
thousand, two hundred five dollars, 
four cents, seven mills, payable imme- 
diately.” 

“Agreed,” he said, appalled at 
both the machine’s efficiency in 
adapting to his language and con- 
ventions and the cost of application. 
He knew that the fee covered only 
the seventy-hour investigation of his 



credentials; if finally admitted as a 
student, he would have to pay an- 
other fee of as much as a huinlred 
thousand dollars for the first term. 
If rejected, he would get no rebate. 

His ^nsor, Electrolus, was pay- 
ing for it, finding it expedient to ship 
him here rather than to keep him 
where his presence might be an em- 
barrassment. Electrolus did not want 
him on hand to give further advice 
that might show up the oversights of 
its own practioners. 

I f be failed to gain admission, there 
would be no consequence — ex- 
cept that his chance to really im- 
prove himself would be gone. He 
could never afford training at the 
University on his own; even if the 
sponsorship requirement should be 
waived. He had traveled all over 
the galaxy since unexpectedly leav- 
ing Earth, solving alien dental prob- 
lems by luck and approximation, but 
he was not the type of man to re- 
lish such uncertainties. He had to 
have advanced training. 

Even so, he hoped that what the 
university had to offer was worth 
it. Over thirteen thousand dollars had 
already been drained from the Elect- 
rolus account here by his verbal 
agreement — for a twenty-one per 
cent probability of acceptance! 

“Present your anterior limb, buc- 
cal surface forward.” 

He put out his left hand again, 
deciding that buccal in this context 
equated with the back of the hand. 
He was nervous in spite of the as- 
surance he had been given that this 
[Hrocess was harmless. A mist ap-

peared around it, puffed and vanish<* 
ed, leaving an inidescent band clasp- 
ed around, or perhaps bonded into, 
the skin of his wrist 

The opposite side of the booth 
opened, and he stepped into a lighted 
corridor. He held up his hand and 
saw that the left of it was bright 
while the right was dead* This re- 
mained even when be twisted his 
wrist, the glow independent of his 
motion. He proceeded left. 

At the end of the passage was a 
row of elevators. Other creatures of 
diverse proportions moved toward 
these, guided by glows on their ap- 
pendages. His own guided him to 
a particular unit. Its panel was open, 
and he entered. 

The door closed as he took hold 
of the supportive bars. The unit 
moved, not up or down as he had 
expected, but backwards. He clung 
desperately to the support as the 
fierce acceleration hurled him at the 
door. 

There was something like a port- 
hole in the side through which he 
could make out racing lights and 
darknesses. If these were stationary 
sources of contrast, his velocity was 
phenomenal. His stomach jumped as 
the vehicle dipped and tilted; then it 
was plummeting down as though 
dropped from a cliff. 

Dillingham was reminded of an 
amusement park he had visited as a 
child on Earth; there had been a ride 
through the dark something like this. 
He was sure that the transport system 
of the university had not been de- 
signed for thrills, however; it merely 
reflected the fact that there was a 
long way to go and many others in 



line. The elevators would not function 
at all for any creature not wearing 
University identification. Established 
galactics took such things in stride 
without even noticing. 

F inally it decelerated and stopped. 

The door opened, and he 
stepped dizzily into his residence for 
the duration, suppressing incipient 
motion-sickness. _ 

The apartment was attractive 
enough. The air was sweet, the light 
moderate, the temperature comfort- 
able. Earthlike vines decorated the 
trellises, and couches fit for human- 
oids were placed against the walls. In 
the center of the main room stood a 
handsome but mysterious device. 

Something emerged from an alcove. 
It was a creature resembling an 
Oversized pincushion with legs, one 
of which sported the ubiquitous ir- 
idescent band. It honked. 

“Greetings, roommate,” a speaker 
from the central artifact said. Dil- 
lingham realized that it was a multi- 
ple-dialect translator. 

“How do you do,” he said. The 
translator honked, and the pincushion 
came all the way into the room. 

“I am from no equivalent term,” 
it said in tootles. 

Dillingham hesitated to comment, 
until he realized that the confusion 
was the translator’s fault. There was 
no name in English for Pincushion’s 
planet, since Earth knew little of 
galactic geography and nothing of 
interspecies commerce. “Substitute 
‘Pincushion’ for the missing term,” 
he advised the machine, “and make 
the same kind of adjustment for any 
of my terms which may not be ren-

11 




derable into Pincushion’s dialect.” He 
turned to the creature. “I am from 
E^rth. I presume you are also here 
to make application for admittance 
to the School of Prosthodontics?” 
The translator honked, once. Dil- 
fingham waited, but that was all. 

Pincushion honked. “Yes, of 
course. I’m sure all beings assigned 
to this dormitory are 1.0 gravity, 
oxygen-imbibing ambulators applying 
as students. The administration is very 
careful to group compatible species.” 
Apparently a single honk could 
convey a paragraph. Perhaps there 
were frequencies he couldn’t hear. 
Then again, it might be the ineffici- 
ency of his own tongue. “I’m new to 
all this,” he admitted. “I know very 
little of the ways of the galaxy, or 
what is expected of me here.” 

“I’ll be happy to show you 
around,” Pincushion said. “My planet 
has been sending students here for, 
well, not a long time, but several 
centuries. We even have a couple of 
instructors here, at the lower levels.” 
There was a note of pride in the 
rendition. “Maybe one of these mil- 
lennia we’ll manage to place a super- 
visor.” 

Already Dillingham could imagine 
the prestige that would carry. 

II 

A t that moment the elevator- 
vehicle disgorged another pas- 
senger. This was a tall oak-like crea- 
ture with small leaf-like tentacles 
fluttering at its sides. The bright Uni- 
versity band circled the center mark. 
It looked at the decorative vines of 
the apartment and spoke with the 



whistle of wind through dead branch- 
es: “Appalling captivity.” 

The sound of the translator seem- 
ed to bring its attention to the other 
occupants. “May your probability of 
acceptance be better than mine,” it 
said by way of greeting. “I am a hum- 
ble modest branch from Treetrunk 
(the translator learned quickly) and 
despite my formidable knowledge of 
prosthodontica my percentage is a 
mere sixty.” 

Somewhere in there had been a 
honk, so Dillingham knew that 
simultaneous translations were being 
performed. This device made the little 
dual-track transcoders he had used 
before seem primitive. 

“You are more fortunate than I,” 
Pincushion replied. “I stand at only 
forth-eight per cent.” 

They both looked at Dillingham. 
Pincushion had knobby stalks that 
were probably eyes, and Treetrunk’s 
apical disks vibrated like the 
greenery of a poplar sapling. 

“Twenty-one per cent,” he said 
sheepishly. 

There was an awkward silence. 
“Well, these are only estimates based 
upon the past performance of your 
species,” Pincushion said. “Perhaps 
your predecessors were not apt.” 

“I don’t think I had any pred- 
ecessors,” Dillingham said. “Earth 
isn’t accredited yet.” He hesitated to 
admit that Earth hadn’t even achieved 
true space travel. He had never been 
embarrassed for his planet before, 
though when he thought about it, he 
realized that he had never had oc- 
casion to consider himself a planetary 
citizen before, either. 

“Experience and competence count 

IF 



12 




more than some machine's guess, Ym 
sure,” Treetrunk said. ‘Tve been 
practicing on my world for six years. 
If you’re — ” 

“Well, I did practice for ten years 
on Earth.” 

“You see — that will probably 
triple your probability when they find 
out,” Pincushion said encouragingly. 
“They just gave you a low probabih- 
ty because no one from your planet 
has applied before.” 

H e hoped they were right, but his 
stomach didn’t settle. He 
doubted that as sophisticated a setup 
as the galactic University would have 
to stoop to such crude approxima- 
tion. The administration already 
knew quite a bit about him from the 
preliminary application, and his 
ignorance of galactic method was sure 
to count heavily against him. “Are 
there — references here?” he inquir- 
ed. “Facilities? If I could look them 
over — ” 

“Good idea!” Pincushion said. 
“Come — the operatory is this way, 
and there is a small museum of equip- 
ment.” 

There was. The apartment had an 
annex equipped with an astonishing 
array of dental technology. There was 
enough for him to study for years 
before he could be certain of mastery. 
He decided to concentrate on the 
racked texts first, after learning that 
they could be fed into the translator 
for ready assimilation in animated 
projection. 

“Standard stuff,” Treetrunk said, 
making a noise like chafing bark. 
“I believe I’ll take an estivation.” 

As Dillingham returned to the 



main room with an armful of the 
boxlike texts, the elevator loosed ai>- 
otb^ creature. This was a four- 
legged cylinder with a bead tapered 
like that of an anteater and peculi- 
arly thin-jointed arms terminating in 
a series of thorns. 

It occurred to him that such 
physical structure would be virtually 
ideal for dentistry. The thorns were 
probably animate rotary burrs, and 
the elongated snout mi^t reach di- 
rectly into the patient’s mouth for 
inspection of close work without the 
imposition of a mirror. After the 
initial introductions, he asked Ant- 
eater how his probability stood. 

“Ninety-eight per cent,” the crea- 
ture replied in an offhand manner. 
“Our kind seldom miss. We’re 
specialized for this sort of thing.” 
Specialization — there was the 
liability of the human form, Dilling- 
ham thought. Men were among the 
most generalized of Earth’s denizens, 
except for their developed brains — 
and obviously these galactics had 
similar intellectual qualities, and had 
been in space so long they were able 
to adapt physically for something as 
narrow as dentistry. The outlook for 
him remained bleak. 

A robotlike individual and a native 
from Electrolus completed the 
apartment’s complement He hadn’t 
known that his sponsor-planet was 
entering one of its own in the same 
curriculum, though it didn’t affect 
him particularly. 

Six diverse creatures, counting him- 
self — all dentists on their home 
worlds, all specializing in prostho- 
dontics, all eager to pass the en-

traocc examinations. All male, with- 
in reasonable definition — the uni- 
versity was very strict about the 
proprieties. This was only one apart- 
ment in‘ a small city reserved for ap- 
plicants. The university proper oc- 
cupied the entire planet. 

They learned all about it that 
evening at the indoctrination briefing, 
guided to the lecture-hall by a blue 
glow manifested on each identifica- 
tion band. The hall was monstrous; 
only the oxygen-breathers attended 
this session, but they numbered al- 
most fifty thousand. Other halls 
catered to differing life-forms simul- 
taneously. 

The university graduated over a 
million highly skilled dentists every 
term and had a constant enrollment 
of twenty times that number. Dilling- 
ham didn’t know how many terms 
it took to graduate — the program 
might be variable — but the inci- 
dence of depletion seemed high. Even 
the total figure represented a very 
minor proportion of the dentistry in 
the galaxy. This proportion was ex- 
tremely important, however, since 
mere admission as a freshman stu- 
dent required qualifications that 
would equip the individual as a 
graduate elsewhere. 

There were generally only a hand- 
ful of University graduates on any 
civilized planet. These were auto- 
matically granted life tenures as in- 
structors at the foremost planetary 
colleges, or established as consultants 
for the most challenging cases avail- 
able. Even the dropouts had healthy 
futures. 

Instructors for the University itself 
were drawn from its own most gifted 



graduates. The top one hundred, ap- 
proximately — of each class of a 
million — were siphoned off for 
special training and retained, and a 
greater number was recruited from 
the lower ranking body of graduates: 
individuals who demonstrated su- 
perior qualifications in subsequent 
galactic practice. A few instructors 
were even recruited from non- 
graduates, when their specialties were 
so restricted and their skills so great 
that such exceptions seemed warrant- 
ed. 

The administrators came largely 
from the University of Administra- 
tion, dental division, situated on an- 
other planet; they wielded enormous 
power. The University President was 
the virtual dictator of the planet, and 
his pronouncements had the force of 
law in dental matters throughout the 
galaxy. Indeed, Dillingham thought 
as he absorbed the information, if 
there were any organization that ap- 
proached galactic overlordship, it was 
the association of University Presi- 
dents. They had the authority — by 
their own declaration — and the 
power to quarantine any world 
found guilty of willful malpractice in 
any of the established University 
fields, and since any quarantine 
covered all fields, it was devastating. 
An abstract was run showing the 
consequence of the last absolute quar- 
antine; within a year that world had 
collapsed in anarchy. What followed 
was not at all pretty. 

D illingham saw that the level of 
skill engendered by University 
training did indeed transcend any 
ordinary practice. No one on Earth 



14 



IF 




had any inkling of th^ techniques 
considered commonplace here. His 
imagination was saturated with the 
marvel of it all. His dream of knowl- 
edge for the sake of knowledge was 
a futile one; such training was far 
too valuable to be reserved for the 
satisfaction of the individual. No 
wonder graduates became public 
servants! The investment was far 
less monetary than cultural and tech- 
nological, for the sponsoring planet. 

His roommates were largely unim- 
pressed. “Everyone knows the uni- 
versities wield galactic power,” Tree- 
trunk said. “This is only one school 
of many, and hardly the most im- 
portant. Take Finance, now — ” 
“Or Transporation,” Pincushion 
added. “Every spaceship, every stel- 
lar conveyor, designed and operated 
by graduates of — ” 

“Or Communication,” Anteater 
said. “Comm U has several cam- 
puses, even, and they’re not dinky 
little planets like this one, either. 
Civilization is impossible without 
communications. What’s a few bad 
teeth, compared to that?” 

Dillingham was shocked. “But all 
of you are dentists. How can you 
take such tremendous knowledge and 
responsibility so casually?” 

“Oh, come now,” Anteater said. 
“The technology of dentistry hasn’t 
changed in millennia. It’s a staid, 
dated institution. Why get excited?” 
“No point in letting ideology go 
to our heads,” Treetrunk agreed. 
“I’m coming here because this train- 
ing will set me up for life on my 
home world. I won’t have to set up 
a practice at aU; I’ll be a consultant. 
It’s the best training in the galaxy 



— we all know that — Init we 
must try to keep it in perspective.” 
The others signified agreement M- 
lingham saw that he was a muMnty 
of one. All the others were interested 
in the training not for its own sake 
but for the monetary and presti^eus 
benefits they could derive from a de- 
gree. 

And all of them had much higher 
probabilities of admission than he. 
Was he wrong? 

Ill 

N ext day they undertook a battery 
of field tests. Dillingham had to 
use the operatory equipment te per- 
form specified tasks: excavation, 

polishing, placement of amalgam, 
measurement, manufacture of assort- 
ed impressions — on a number of 
familiar and unfamiliar jaws. He had 
to diagnose and prescribe. He had 
to demonstrate facility in all phases 
of laboratory work — facility he 
now felt woefully deficient in. The 
equipment was versatile, and he had 
no particular difficulty adjusting to 
it, but it was so well made and 
precise that he was certain his own 
abilities fell far short of those for 
whom it was intended. 

The early exercises were routine, 
and he was able to do them easily 
in the time recommended. Gradually, 
however, they became more difficult, 
and he had to concentrate as never 
before to accomplish the assignments 
at all, let alone on schedule. There 
were several jaws so alien that he 
could not determine their modes of 
action and had to pass them by even 
though the treatment seemed sinqple

15 




enough. But he remembered his re- 
cent experiences with galactic denti- 
tion, and the unsuspected mechanisms 
of seemingly ordinary teeth, and so 
refused to perform repairs even on 
a dummy jaw that might be more 
harmful th^ no repair at all. 

During the rest breaks he chatted 
with his companions, all in neighbor- 
ing operatories, and learned to his 
dismay that none of them were hav- 
ing difficulties. “How can you be 
sure of the proper occlusal on #17?” 
he asked Treetrunk. “There was no 
upper mandible present for compari- 
son.” 

“That was an Oopoo jaw,” Tree- 
trunk rustled negligently. “Oopoos 
have no uppers. There’s just a bony 
plate, perfectly regular. Didn’t you 
know that?” 

“You recognize all the types of 
jaw in the galaxy?” Dillingham asked 
him, hardly crediting it. 

“Certainly. I have read at least one 
text on the dentures of every ac- 
credited species. We Treetrunks 
never forget.” 

Eidetic memory! How could a 
mere man compete with a creature 
wh6 was able to peruse a million or 
more texts and retain every detail 
of each? He understood more and 
more plainly why his probability of 
success was so low. He was beginning 
to wonder whether it had not been 
set unrealistically high, in fact. 

“What was #36, the last one?” 
Pincushion inquired. “I didn’t recog- 
nize it, and I thought I knew them 
all.” 

T ’ reetrunk became slightly wilted. 
“I never saw that one before,” 



he admitted. “It must have been ex- 
tra-galactic, or a theoretic simula- 
crum designed to test our extrapola- 
tion.” 

‘The work was obvious, however,” 
Anteater observed. “I polished it off 
in four seconds.” 

“Four seconds!” All the others 
were amazed. 

“Well, we are adapted for this 
sort of routine,” Anteater said patron- 
izingly. “Our burrs are built in, and 
all the rest of it. My main delay is 
generally in diagnosis. But #36 was 
a straightforward labial cavity re- 
quiring a plastoid substructure and 
metallic overlay, heated to 540 de- 
grees Centigrade for thirty-seven 
microseconds.” 

“Thirty-nine microseconds,” Tree- 
trunk corrected him, a shade smugly. 
“You forgot to allow for the red- 
shift in the overhead beam. But 
that’s still remarkable time.” 

“I employed my natural illumina- 
tion, naturally,” Anteater said, just 
as smugly, flashing a yellow light 
from his snout. “No distortion there. 
But I believe my alloy differs slightly 
from what is considered standard, 
which may account for the difference. 
Your point is good, nevertheless. I 
hope none of the others forgot that 
adjustment?” 

The Electrolyte settled an inch. 
“I did,” he confessed. 

Dillingham was too stunned to be 
despondent. Had all of them diag- 
nosed #36 so readily, and were they 
all so perceptive as to be auto- 
matically aware of the wavelength 
of a particular beam of light? Or 
were there such readings available 
through the equipment, that he didn’t 

IF 



16 




know about, and wouldn’t be com- 
petent to use if he did know? He had 
pondered that jaw for the full time 
allotted and finally given it up un- 
touched. True, the cavity had ap- 
peared to be perfectly straightforward, 
but it was too clean to ring true. 
Could — 

The buzzer sounded for the final 
session, and they dispersed to their 
several compartments. 

Dillingham was contemplating #41 
with mounting frustration when he 
heard Treetrunk, via the translator 
extension, call to Anteater. “I can’t 
seem to get this S-curve excavation 
right,” he complained. “Would you 
lend me your snout?” 

A joke, of course, Dillingham 
thought. Discussion of cases 
after they were finished was one 
thing, but consultation during the 
exam — ! 

“Certainly,” Anteater replied.' He 
trotted past Dillingham’s unit and en- 
tered Treetrunk’s compartment. There 
was the muted beep of his high- 
speed proboscis drill. “You people 
confined to manufactured tools labor 
under such a dreadful disadvantage,” 
he remarked. “It’s a wonder you 
can qualify at all!” 

“Hmph,” Treetrunk replied good- 
naturedly . and later returned 
the favor by providing a spot diag- 
nosis based on his knowledge of an 
obscure chapter of an ancient text, 
to settle a case that had Anteater in 
doubt. “It isn’t as though we were 
competing against each other,” he 
said. “Every point counts!” 

Dillingham ploughed away, upset. 
Of course there had been nothing in 



the posted regulations forbidding such 
procedure, but he had taken it as 
implied. Even if galactic ethics dif- 
fered from his own in this respect, 
he couldn’t see his way clear to draw 
on any knowledge or skill other than 
his own. Not in this situation. 

Meanwhile, #41 was a different 
kind of problem. The directive, in- 
stead of saying, “Do what is neces- 
sary,” as it had for the #36 they 
had discussed during the break, was 
this time specific. “Create an a|>- 
propriate mesiocclusodistal metal-al- 
loy inlay for the afflicted fifth mslar 
in this humanoid jaw.” 

This was perfectly feasible. Despite 
its oddities as judged by Earthly 
standards, it was humanoid and there- 
fore roughly familiar to him. So 
men did not have more than three 
molars in a row; he now knew that 
other species did. He had by this 
time mastered the sophisticated equip- 
ment well enough to do the job in a 
fraction of the time he had required 
on Earth. He could have the inlay 
shaped and cast within the time limit 

The only trouble was his experi- 
ence, and observation indicated tliaS 
the specified reconstruction was jonl 
proper in this case. It would require 
the removal of far more healthy den- 
tin than was necessary, for one thing. 
In addition, there was evidence ii 
persistent inflammation in the gingival 
tissue that could herald periodontal 
disease. 

He finally disobeyed the instruc- 
tions and placed a temporary filling. 
He hoped he would be given tlM 
opportunity to explain his actimi, 
though he was afraid he had already 
failed the exam. There was just tno

much to do, he knew too little, and 
the competition was too strong. 

IV 

T he field examination was finished 
in the afternoon, and nothing 
was scheduled for that evening. Next 
day the written exam — actually a 
combination of written, verbal and 
demonstrative questions — was due, 
and everyone except Treetrunk was 
deep in the texts. Treetrunk was dic- 
tating a letter home, the translator 
blanked out so that his narration 
would not disturb the others. 

Dillingham pored over the three- 
dimensional pictures and captions 
produced by the tomes while listening 
to the accompanying lecture. There 
was so much to master in such a 
short time! It was fascinating — 
but he could handle only a tiny frac- 
tion of it. He wondered what phe- 
nomenal material remained to be 
presented in the courses themselves, 
since all the knowledge of the galaxy 
seemed to be required just to pass 
the entrance exam. Tooth transplan- 
tation? Tissue regeneration? Restora- 
tion of the enamel itself, rather than 
crude metal fillings? 

The elevator opened. A creature 
rather like a walking oyster emerged. 
Its yard-wide shell opened to reveal 
eyestalks and a comparatively dainty 
mouth. “This is the — dental yard?” 
it inquired timorously. 

“Great purple quills!” Pincushion 
swore quietly. “One of those insidious 
panhandlers. I thought they’d clear- 
ed such obtusities out long ago.” 
Treetrunk, closest to the door, 
looked up and switched on his sec- 



tion of the translator. “The whole 
planet is dental, idiot,” he snapped 
after the query had been repeated 
for him. “This is a private dormi- 
tory.” 

The oyster persisted. “But you are 
off-duty dentists? I have a terrible 
toothache — ” 

“We are applicants'^ Treetrunk in- 
formed it imperiously. “What you 
want is the clinic. Please leave us 
alone.” 

“But the clinic is closed. Please — 
my jaw pains me so that I can not 
eat. I am an old clam — ” 

Treetrunk impatiently switched off 
the translator and resumed his letter. 
No one else said anything. 

Dillingham could not let this pass. 
Treetrunk had disconnected himself, 
but the translator still functioned for 
the other languages. “Isn’t there some 
regular dentist you can see who can 
relieve the pain until morning? We 
are studying for a very important 
examination.” 

“I have no credit — - no money 
for private service,” Oyster wailed. 
“The clinic is closed for the night, 
and my tooth — ” 

D illingham looked at the pile of 
texts before him. He had so 
little time, and the material was so 
important. He had to make a good 
score tomorrow to mitigate today’s 
disaster. 

“Please,” Oyster whined. “It pains 
me so — ” 

He gave up. He was not sure 
regulations permitted it, but he had 
to do something. There was a chance 
he could at least relieve the pain. 
“Come with me,” he said. 



18 



IF 




Pincushion waved his pins, actually 
sensitive cilia capable of intricate 
maneuvering. ‘‘Not In our operatory/* 
he protested. “How can we concen- 
trate with that going on?” 

Dillingham restrained his unrea- 
sonable anger and took the patient 
to the elevator. After some errors, 
he located a vacant testing operatory 
eliewhere in the application section. 
Fortunately the translators were 
everywhere, so he could converse 
with the creature and clarify its com- 
plaint. 

“The big flat one,” it said as it 
propped itself awkwardly in the chair 
and opened its shell. “It hurts.” 

He took a look. The complaint was 
valid; most of the teeth had conven- 
tional plasticene filings, but one had 
somehow been dislodged from the 
proximal surface of a molar: a Class 
II restoration. The gap was packed 
with rancid vegetable matter — sea- 
weed? — and was undoubtedly quite 
uncomfortable. 

“You must understand,” he cau- 
tioned the creature, “that I am not a 
regular dentist here, or even a stu- 
dent. I have neither the authority 
nor the competence to do any work 
of a permanent nature on your teeth. 
All I can do is clean out the cavity 
and attempt to relieve the pain so 
that you can get along until the 
clinic opens in the morning. Then 
an authorized dentist can do the job 
properly. Do you understand?” 

“It hurts,” Oyster repeated. 
Dillingham located the creature’s 
planet in the directory and punched 
out the formula for a suitable an- 
esthetic. The dispenser gurgled and 
rolled out a cylinder and swab. He 



opened the former and dabbed with 
the latter around the affected area, 
restraining his irritation at the 
patient’s evident inability to sit still 
even for this momentary operation. 
While waiting for it to take effect, he 
requested more information from the 
translator, which he had discovered 
was also quite a versatile instrument. 

“Dominant species of Planet Oys- 
ter,” the machine reported. “HigWy 
intelligent, non-specialized, emotion- 
ally stable life-form.” Dillingham 
tried to reconcile this with what he 
had already observed of his patient, 
and concluded that individuals must 
vary considerably from the norm. He 
listened to further vital information, 
and soon had a fair idea of Oyster’s 
general nature and the advisable care 
of his dentition. There did not seem 
to be any factors inhibiting his treat- 
ment of this complaint. 

H e applied a separator, over the 
patient’s protest, and cleaned out 
the impacted debris with a spoon ex- 
cavator without difficulty, but Oyster 
shied away at sight of the rotary 
diamond burr. “Hurts!” he protested. 

“I have given you adequate local 
anesthesia,” Dilligham explained. 
“You should feel nothing except a 
slight vibration in yotir jaw, which 
will not be uncomfortable, lliis is a 
standard drill, the same kind I’m 
sure you’ve seen many times before.” 
As he spoke, he marveled at what he 
now termed standard. The burr was 
shaped like nothing — literally — 
on Earth and rotated at 150,000 
r.p.m. — several times the maximum 
employed back home. It was awe- 
somely efficient.

19 




Oyster shut mouth and shell firm- 
ly. “Hurts!” his whisper emerged 
through clenched defenses. 

Dillingham thought despairingly of 
the time this was costing him. If he 
didn’t return to his texts soon, he 
would forfeit his remaining chance 
to pass the written exam. 

He sighed and put away the power 
tool. “Perhaps I can clean it with 
the hand instruments,” he said; 
“I’ll have to use this rubber dam, 
though, since this will take more 
time.” 

One look at the patient convinced 
him otherwise. Regretfully he put 
away the rubber square that would 
have kept the field of operation dry 
and clean while he worked. 

He had to break through the over- 
hanging enamel with a chisel, the 
patient wincing every time he lifted 
the mallet and doubling the necessity 
for the assistant he didn’t have. A 
power mallet would have helped, but 
that, too, was out. It was a tedious 
and difficult task. He had to scrape 
off every portion of the ballroom 
cavity from an awkward angle, hard- 
ly able to see what he was doing 
since he needed a third hand for the 
dental mirror. 

It would have to be a Class II — 
jammed in the side of the molar fac- 
ing the adjacent molar, both sturdy 
teeth with very little give. A Class 
II was the very worst restoration to 
attempt in makeshift fashion. He 
could have accelerated the process by 
doing a slipshod job, but it was not 
in him to skiniip even when he knew 
it was only for a night. Half an hour 
passed before he performed the 
toilet: blowing out the loose debris 



with a jet of warm air, swabbing 
the interior with alcohol, drying again. 

4C"^Tow I’m going to block this 
with a temporary wax,” he 
told Oyster. “This will not stand up 
to intensive chewing, but should hold 
you comfortably until morning.” Not 
that the warning was likely to make 
much difference. The trouble had 
obviously started when the original 
fillings came loose, but it had been 
weeks since that had happened. Evi- 
dently the patient had not bothered 
to have it fixed until the pain be- 
came unbearable — and now that 
the pain was gone, Oyster might well 
delay longer, until the work had to 
be done all over again. The short- 
sighted refuge from initial incon- 
venience was hardly a monopoly of 
Earthly sufferers. 

“No,” Oyster said, jolting him 
back to business. “Wax tastes bad.” 

“This is guaranteed tasteless to 
most life-forms, and it is only for 
the night. As soon as you report 
to the clinic — ” 

“Tastes bad!” the patient insisted, 
starting to close his shell. 

Dillingham wondered again just 
what the translator had meant by 
“highly intelligent . emotionally 
stable.” He kept his peace and dialed 
for amalgam. 

“Nasty color,” Oyster said. 

“But this is pigmented red, to 
show that the filling is intended as 
temporary. It will hardly show, in this 
location. I don’t want the clinic to 
have any misunderstanding.” 

The shell clamped all the way 
shut, nearly pinning his fingers. 
“Nasty color!” 



20 



IF 




It occurred to him that more was 
involved than capricious difficulty. 
Did this patient intend to go to the 
clinic at all? Oyster might be angling 
for a permanent filling. “What color 
does suit you?” 

“Gold.” 

It figured. Well, better to humor 
the patient, rather than try to force 
him into a more sensible course. Dil- 
lingham could make a report to the 
authorities, who could then roust out 
Oyster and check the work properly. 

At his direction, the panel extruded 
a ribbon of gold foil. He placed this 
in the miniature annealing oven and 
waited for the slow heat to act. 

“You’re burning it up!” Oyster 
protested. 

“By no means. It is necessary to 
make the gold cohesive, for better 
service. You see — ” 

“Hot,” Oyster said. So much for 
helpful explanations. He could have 
employed noncohesive metal, but this 
was a lesser technique that didn’t ap- 
peal to him. 

V 

A t length he had suitable rop^ 
of gold for the slow, delicate 
task of building up the restoration 
inside the cavity. The first layer was 
down; once he malleted it into 
place — 

The elevator burst asunder. A sec- 
ond oyster charged into the operatory 
waving a translucent tube. “Villain!” 
it exclaimed. “What are you doing 
to my grandfather?” 

Dillingham was taken aback. “Your* 
grandfather? I’m trying to make him 
comfortable until — ” 



The newcomer would have none 
of it. “You’re torturing himi My 
poor, dear, long-suffering grandfatherl 
Monster! How could you?” 

“But I’m only—” 

Young Oyster leveled the tube at 
him. Dillin^am noticed irrelevantly 
that its end was solid. “Get away 
from my grandfather. I saw you 
hammering spikes into his venerable 
teeth, you sadist! I’m taking him 
home!” 

Dillingham did not move. He con- 
sidered this a stance of necessity, not 
courage. “Not until I complete this 
work. I can’t let him go out like this, 
with the excavation exposed.” 
“Beast! Pervert! HumanoidV' the 
youngster screamed. “I’ll volatize 
you!” 

Searing light beamed from the solid 
tube. The metal mallet in Dillingham’s 
hand melted and dripped to the floor. 

He leaped for the oyster and 
grappled for the weapon. The giant 
shell clamped shut upon his hand as 
they fell to the floor. He struggled 
to right himself, but discovered that 
the creature had withdrawn all its 
appendages and now was nothing 
more than a two-hundred pound 
clam — with Dillingham’s left hand 
firmly pinioned. 

“Assaulter of innocents!” the 
youngster squeaked from within the 
shell. “Unprovoked attacker. Get 
your foul paw out of my ear!” 
“Friend, I’U be glad to do that — 
as soon as you let go,” he gasped. 
What a situation for a dentist! 
“Help! Butchery! Genocide!” 

D illingham finally found his foot- 
ing and hauled on his arm. The 



22 



IF 




shell tilted and lifted from the £loor» 
but gradually the trapped hand slid 
free. He quickly sat on the shell to 
prevent it from opening again and 
surveyed the damage. 

Blood trickled from multiple 
scratches along the wrist, and his 
hand smarted strenuously, but there 
was no serious wound. 

“Let my grandson go!” the old 
oyster screamed now. “You have no 
right to muzzle him like that! This 
is a free planet!” 

Dillingham marveled once more at 
the translator’s description. These just 
did not seem to be reasonable crea- 
tures. He stood up quickly and pick- 
ed up the fallen tube. 

“Look, gentlemen — I’m very 
sorry if I have misunderstood your 
conventions, but I must insist that 
the young person leave.” 

Young Oyster peeped out of his 
shell. “Unwholesome creature! Eater 
of sea-life! How dare you make de- 
mands of us?” 

Dillingham pointed the tube at him. 
He had no idea how to fire it, but 
hoped the creature could be bluffed. 
“Please leave at once. I will release 
your grandfather as soon as the work 
is done.” 

The youngster focused on the 
weapon and obeyed, grumbling. Dil- 
lingham touched the elevator lock as 
soon as he was gone. 

The oldster was back in the 
chair. Somehow the adjustment had 
changed, so that this was now a 
basket-like receptacle, obviously more 
comfortable for this patient. “You 
are more of a being than you appear,” 
Oyster remarked. “/ was never able 
to handle that juvenile so efficiently.” 



D illingham contemplated the drop- 
lets of metal splattered on the 
floor. That heat-beam had been en- 
tirely too close — and deadly. His 
hands began to shake in delayed re- 
action. He was not a man of violence, 
and his own quick reaction had sur- 
prised him. The stress of recent 
events had certainly gotten to him, he 
thought ruefully. 

“But he’s a good boy, really,” 
Oyster continued. “A trifle impetuous 
— but he inherited that from me. I 
hope you won’t report this little mis- 
understanding.” 

He hadn’t thought of that, but of 
course it was his duty to make a 
complete report on the melee and the 
reason for it. Valuable equipment 
might have been damaged, not to 
consider the risk to his own welfare. 
“I’m afraid I must,” he said. 

“But they are horribly strict!” the 
oldster protested. “They will throw 
him into a foul salty cesspool! They’ll 
boil him in vinegar every hour! His 
children will be stigmatized!” 

“I can’t take the law into my own 
hands. The court — or whatever it 
is here — must decide. I must make 
an accurate report.” 

“He was only looking out for his 
ancestor. That’s very important to 
our culture. He’s a good — 

The Oyster paused. His shell 
quivered, and the soft flesh within 
turned yellow. 

Dillingham was alarmed. “Sir — 
are you well?” 

The translator spoke on its own 
initiative. “The Oyster shows the 
symptoms of severe emotional shock. 
His health will be endangered un- 
less immediate relief is available.”

All he needed was a dying galactic 
on top of everything else I “How can 
I help him?” The shell was gradual- 
ly sagging closed with an insidious 
suggesftiveness. 

“The negative enK)tiqnal stimulus 
must be alleviated,” the translator 
said. “At his age, such disturbances 
are — ” 

Dillingham took one more look 
at the visibly putrifying creature. “All 
right!” he shouted desperately. “I’ll 
withhold my report!” 

The collapse ceased. “You won’t 
tell anyone?” the oldster inquired 
from the murky depths. “No matter 
what?” 

“No one.” Dillingham was not at 
all happy, but saw no other way out. 
Better silence than a dead patient. 

The night was well advanced when 
he finished with the Oyster and sent 
him home. He had forfeited his study 
period and, by the time he was able 
to relax, much of his sleep as well. 
He would have to brave the ex- 
amination without preparation. 

I t was every bit as bad as he had 
anticipated. His mind was dull 
from lack of sleep, and his basic store 
of information was meager indeed 
on the galactic scale. The questions 
would have been quite difficult even 
if he had been fully prepared. There 
were entire categories he had to skip 
because they concerned specialized 
procedures buried in his unread texts. 
If only he had had time to prepare! 

The others were having trouble too. 
He could see them humped over 
their tables, or under them, depend- 
ing on physiology, scribbling notes as 
they figured ratios and tolerances 



and indices of material properties. 
Even Treetrunk looked hard-pressed. 
If Treetrunk, with a galactic library 
of dental information filed in his 
celluloid brain, could wilt with the 
effort, how could a poor humanoid 
from a backward planet hope to 
succeed? 

But he carried on to the dis- 
couraging end, knowing that his score 
would damn him but determined to 
do his best whatever the situation. 
It seemed increasingly ridiculous, but 
he still wanted to be admitted to 
the university. The thought of desert- 
ing this stupendous reservoir of in- 
formation and technique was ap- 
paling. 

During the afternoon break he 
collapsed on his bunk and slept. One 
day remained, one final trial — the 
interrogation by the Admissions Ad- 
visory Council. This, he understood, 
was the roughest gauntlet of all; more 
applications were rejected on the basis 
of this interview than from both 
other tests combined. 

An outcry woke him in the evening. 
‘The probabilities are being posted!” 
Pincushion honked, prodding him 
with a spine that was not, despite its 
appearance, sharp. 

“Mine’s twenty-one per cent, not 
a penny more,” Dillingham muttered 
sleepily. “Low — too low.” 

“The revised probs!” Pincushion 
said. “Based on the test scores. The 
warning buzzer just sounded.” 

D illingham snapped awake. He 
remembered now; no results 
were posted for the field and written 
exams. Instead the original estimates 
of acceptance were modified in the

light of mdividual data. This provided 
unlikely applicants with a graceful op- 
portunity to bow out before sub- 
jecting themselves to the indignity of 
a negative recommendation by the 
AA Council. It also undoubtedly 
simplified the work of that council 
by cutting down on the number of 
interviewees. 

They clustered in a tense semicircle 
around the main translator. The re- 
sults would be given in descending 
order. Dillingham wondered why 
more privacy in such matters wasn’t 
provided, but assumed that the Uni- 
versity had its reasons. Possibly the 
constant comparisons encouraged bet- 
ter effort, or weeded out the quitters 
that much sooner. 

“Anteater,” the speaker said. It 
paused. “Ninety-six per cent.” 

Anteater twitched his nose in re- 
lief. “I must have guessed right on 
those stress formulations,” he said. 
“I knew I was in trouble on those 
computations.” 

“Treetrunk — eighty-five per 
cent.” Treetrunk almost uprooted 
himself with glee. “A 25% in- 
crease!” he exulted. “I must have 
maxed the written portion after all!” 

“Robot — sixty-eight per cent.” 
The robotoid took the news impas- 
sively. 

The remaining three fidgeted, 
knowing that their scores had to be 
lower. 

“Pincushion — fifty per cent.” 
The creature congratulated himself 
on an even chance, though he ob- 
viously had hoped to do better. 

“Electrolyte — twenty-three per 
cent.” 

The rocklike individual rolled 



toward his compartment. “I was 
afraid of that. I’m going home.” 

The rest watched Dillingham sym- 
pathetically, anticipating the worst. 
It came. “Earthman — three per 
cent,” the speaker said plainly. 

The last reasonable hope was gone. 
The odds were thirty to one against 
him, and his faith in miracles was 
small. The others scattered, em- 
barrassed for him, while Dillingham 
stood rigid. 

He had known he was in trouble 
— but this! To be given, on the 
basis of thorough testing, practically 
no chance of admission . 

He was forty-one years old. He felt 
like crying. 

VI 

T he Admissions Advisory Council 
was alien even by the standards 
he had learned in the galaxy. There 
were only three members — but as 
soon as this occurred to him, he re- 
alized that this would be only the 
fraction of the Council assigned to 
his case. There were probably hun- 
dreds of interviews going on at this 
moment, as thousands of applicants 
were processed. 

One member was a honeycomb of 
gelatinous tissue suspended on a trel- 
lislike framework. The second was a 
mass of purple sponge. The third was 
an undulating something confined 
within a tank — a water-breather, 
if that liquid were water. If it breath- 
ed. 

The speaker set in the wall of the 
tank came to life. This was evidently 
the spokesman, if any were required. 
“We do not interview many with so

low a probability of admission as 
students,” Tank said. “Why did you 
persist?” 

Why, indeed? Well, he had nothing 
further to lose by forthrightness. “I 
still want to enter the University. 
There is still a chance.” 

“Your examination results are 
hardly conducive to admission as a 
student,” Tank said, and it was amaz- 
ing how much scorn could be in- 
fused into the tone of the mechanical 
translation. “While your field exer- 
cises were fair, your written produc- 
tion was incompetent. You appear to 
be ignorant of all but the most pri- 
mitive and limited aspects of prostho- 
dontistry. Why should you wish to 
undertake training for which your 
capacity is plainly insufficient?” 
“Most of the questions of the sec- 
ond examination struck me as relating 
to basic information, rather than po- 
tential,” Dillingham said woodenly, 
“If I had that information already, 1 
would not stand in such need of the 
training. I came here to learn.” 

“An intriguing attitude. We ex- 
pect, nevertheless, a certain minimum 
background. Otherwise our efforts are 
wastefuUy diluted.” 

F or this Dillingham had no 
answer. Obviously the ranking 
specialists of the galaxy should not 
be used for elementary instruction. 
He understood the point — yet 
something in him would not capitu- 
late. There had to be more to this 
hearing than an automatic decision 
on the basis of tests whose results 
could be distorted by participant co- 
operation on the one hand, and cir- 
cumstantial denial of study-time on 



the. other. Why have an advisory 
board at all, if that were all? 

“1 am concerned with certain as- 
pects of your field work,” the honey- 
comb creature said. He spoke by 
vibrating his tissue in the air, but the 
voice emerged from his translator. 
“Why did you neglect particular 
items?” 

“Do you noean number seven- 
teen? I was unfamiliar with the 
specimen and therefore could not 
repair it competently.” 

“You refused to work on it mere- 
ly because it was new to your experi- 
ence?” Again the towering scorn. 

That did make it sound bad. “No. 
I would have done something if I 
had had more evidence of its nature. 
But the specimen was not complete. 
I felt that there was insufficent infor- 
mation presented to justify attempted 
repairs.” 

“You could not have hurt an inert 
model very much. Surely you realized 
that even an incorrect repair would 
have brought you a better score than 
total failure?” 

He had not known that. “I as- 
sumed that these specimens stood in 
lieu of actual patients. I gave them 
the same consideration I would have 
given a living, feeling creature. Neg- 
lect of a cavity in the tooth of a live 
patient might lead to the eventual 
loss of that tooth — but an incor- 
rect repair could have caused more 
serious damage. Sometimes it is bet- 
ter not to interfere.” 

“Explain.” 

“When I visited the planet Electro- 
lus I saw that the metallic restorations 
in native teeth were indirectly inter- 
fering with communication, which

was disastrous to the well-being of 
the individual This impressed upon 
me how dangerous well-meaning 
iterance could be, even in so simple 
a matter as a filling.’* 

*The chairman of the Dental 
League of planet Electrolus is a Uni- 
versity graduate. Are you accusing 
him of ignorance?” 

O h-oh. “Perhaps the problem had 
not come to his attention,” Dil- 
lingham said, trying to evade the 
trap. 

“We will return to that at another 
time,” the purple sponge said grimly. 
The applicant’s reasoning hardly 
seemed to impress this group. 

“You likewise ignored item number 
thirty-six,” Honeycomb said. “Was 
your reasoning the same?” 

“Yes. The jaw was so alien to my 
experience that I could not safely 
assume that there was anything wrong 
with it, let alone attempt to fix it. 
I suppose I was foolish not to fill 
the labial cavity, but that would have 
required an assumption I was not 
equipped to make.” 

“How much time did you spend 
— deciding not to touch the cavity?” 
Honeycomb inquired sweetly. 

“Half an hour.” Pointless to ex- 
plain that he had gone over every 
surface of #36 looking for some 
confirmation that its action was simi- 
lar to that of any of the jaws he 
was familiar with. “If I may inquire 
now — what was the correct treat- 
ment?” 

“None. It was a healthy jaw.” 
DilKngham’s breath caught. “You 
mean if I had filled that theoretic 
cavity — ” 



“You would have destroyed our 
extragalactic patient’s health.” 

“Then my decision on #36 helped 
my examination score 1” 

“No. Your decision was based on 
uncertainty, not upon accurate diag- 
nosis. It threw your application into 
serious question.” 

He shut his mouth and waited. 
“You did not follow instructions 
on number 41,” Honeycomb said. 
“Why?” 

“I felt the instructions were mis- 
taken. The placement of an MOD 
inlay was unnecessary for the correc- 
tion of the condition, and foolish in 
the face of the peril the tooth was 
in from gingivitis. Why perform ex- 
pensive and complicated reconstruc- 
tion, when untreated gum disease 
threatens to nullify it soon anyway?” 
“Would that iiay have damaged 
the function of the tooth in any 
way?” 

“Yes, in the sense that no recon- 
struction can be expected to perform 
as well as the original. But even if 
there were no difference, that place- 
ment was functionally unnecessary. 
The expense and discomfcat to the 
patient must also be considered. The 
dentist owes it to his patient to ad- 
♦vise him of — ” 

“You are repetitive. Do you place 
your judgment before that of the 
University?” 

Trouble again. “I must act on my 
own best judgment, when I am charg- 
ed with the responsibility. Perhaps, 
with University training, I would 
have been able to make a more in- 
formed decision.” 

“Kindly delete the pleading,” 
Honeycomb said.

Qomething was certainly wrong 
somewhere. All his conjectures 
seemed to go against the intent of 
this institution. Did its standards, as 
weU as its knowledge, differ so 
radically from his own? Could all 
of his professional instincts be 
wrong? 

“Your performance on the written 
examination was extremely poor,” 
Sponge said. “Are you naturally 
stupid, or did you fail to apply your- 
self properly?” 

“I could have done better if I had 
studied more.” 

“You failed to prepare yourself?” 

Worse and worse. “Yes.” 

“You were aware of the impor- 
tance of the examination?” 

“Yes.” 

“You had suitable texts on hand?” 

“Yes.” 

“Yet you did not bother to study 
them.” 

“I wanted to, but — ” Then he 
remembered his promise to the Oy- 
ster. He could not give his reason for 
failing to study. If this trio picked 
up any hint of that episode, it 
would not relent until everything were 
exposed. After suffering this much 
of its interrogation, he retained no 
illusions about the likely fate of 
young Oyster, No wonder the grand- 
father had been anxious! 

“What is your pretext for such 
neglect?” 

“I can offer none.” 

The color of the sponge darkened. 
“We are compelled to view with dis- 
favor an applicant who neither ap- 
plies himself nor cares to excuse his 
negligence. This is not the behavior 
we expect in our students.” 



Dillingham said nothing. His po- 
sition was hopeless — but he still 
couldn’t give up until they made his 
rejection final. 

VII 

T ank resumed the dialog. “You 
have an interesting record. 
Alarming in some respects. You 
came originally from planet Earth — 
one of the aborigine cultures. Why 
did you desert your tribe?” 

They had such unfortunate ways of 
putting things! “I was contacted by 
a galactic voyager who required 
prosthodontic repair. I presume ho 
picked my name out of the local 
directory.” He described his initial 
experience with the creatures he had 
dubbed, facetiously, the North Nebu- 
lites, or Enens. 

“You operated on a totally un- 
familiar jaw?” Tank asked abruptly. 

“Yes.” Under duress, however. 
Should he remind them? 

“Yet you refused* to do similar 
work on a dummy jaw at this Uni- 
versity,” Honeycomb put in. 

They were sharp. “I did what 
seemed necessary at the time.” 
“Don’t your standards appear in- 
consistent, even to you?” Sponge in- 
quired. 

Dillingham laughed, not happily. 
“Sometimes they do.” How much 
deeper could he bury himself? 

Tank’s turn. “Why did you ac- 
company the aliens to their world?” 
“I did not have very much choice.” 
“So you did not come to space 
in search of superior prosthodontic 
techniques?” 

“No. It is possible that I might

28 




have done so, however, had I known 
of their availability at ^e time.” 

“Yes, you have repeatedly ex- 
pressed your interest,” Tank said. 
“Yet you did not bother to study 
from the most authoritative texts 
available on the subject in the galaxy, 
when you had the opportunity and 
the encouragement to do so.” 

Once again his promise prevented 
him from replying. He was coming 
to understand why his roommates had 
shown so little desire to spend time 
helping the supplicant. It appeared, 
in retrospect, to be a sure passport 
to failure. 

C ould he have passed — that is, 
brought his probability up to a 
reasonable level — had he turned 
away that plea? Should he have sacri- 
ficed that one creature, for the sake 
of the hundreds he might have help- 
ed later, with proper training? He 
had been shortsighted. 

He knew he would do the same 
thing again, in similar circumstances. 
He just didn’t have the heart to be 
that practical. At the same time, he 
could see why the businesslike Uni- 
versity would have little use for such 
sentimentality. 

“On planet deep,” Tank said, sur- 
prising him by using his own lu- 
dicrous term for the next world he 
had visited, “you filled a single cavity 
with twenty-four tons of goldalloy.” 
“Yes.” 

“Are you not aware that gold, 
however plentiful it may be on 
deep, remains an exceptionally valu- 
able commodity in the galaxy? Why 
did you not develop a less wasteful 
substitute?” 



Dillingham tried to explain about 
the awkwardness of that situation, 
about the pressure of working within 
the cavernous mouth of a three-hun- 
dred-foot sea creature, but it did seem 
that he had made a mistake. He 
could have employed a q>ecialized 
cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy 
that would have been strong, hard, 
resilient and resistant to corrosion, 
and might well have been superior 
to gold in that particular case. He 
had worried, for example, about the 
weight of such a mass of gold, and 
this alternate, far lighter, would have 
alleviated that concern. It was also 
much cheaper stuff. He had not 
thought about these things at the 
time. He said so. 

“Didn’t you consult your Enen 
associates?” 

“I couldn’t. The English/ Enen 
transcoder was broken.” But that was 
no excuse for not having had them 
develop the chrome-cobalt alloy ear- 
lier. He had allowed his personal 
preference for the more familiar gold 
to halt his quest for improvement. 

“Yet you did communicate with 
them later, surmounting that prob- 
lem.” 

He was becoming uncomfortably 
aware that this group had done its 
homework. The members seemed to 
know everything about him. “I dis- 
covered by accident that the Eng- 
lish-Gleep and Gleep-Enen transco- 
ders could be used in concert. I had 
not realized that at the time.” 

“Because you were preoccupied 
with the immediate problem?” 

“I think so.” 

“But not too preoccupied to no- 
tice decay in the neighboring teeth.”

“No/’ It did look foolish now, to 
have been so concerned with future 
dental problems, while wasting many 
tons, of valuable metal on the work in 
progress. How did that jibe with his 
more recent concern for the Oyster’s 
problem, to the exclusion of the 
much larger University picture? Was 
there any coherent rationale to his 
actions, or was he continually ration- 
alizing to excuse his errors? 

Was the seeming unfairness of 
this interview merely a way of prov- 
ing this to him? 

B ut Tank wasn’t finished. “You 
next embarked with a passing 
diplomat of uncertain reputation who 
suggested a way to free you from 
your, commitment to deep.” 

“He was very kind.” Dillingham 
did not regret his brief association 
with Trach, the galactic who resem- 
bled a trachodon dinosaur. 

“He resembled one of the vicious 
predators of your planet’s past — 
yet you trusted your person aboard 
his ship?” 

“I felt, in the face of galactic 
diversity of species, that it was foolish 
to judge by appearances. One has to 
be prepared to extend trust, if one 
wants to receive it.” 

“You believe that?” Honeycomb 
demanded. 

“I try to.” It was so hard to de- 
fend himself against the concentrated 
suspicion of the Council. 

“You do not seem to trust the 
common directives of this University, 
however.” 

What answer could he make to 
that? They had him in another con- 
flict. 



“Whereupon you proceeded to in- 
vestigate another unfamiliar jaw,” 
Tank said. “Contrary to your ex- 
pressed policy. Why?” 

‘Trach had befriended me, and I 
wanted to help him.” 

“So you put friendship above 
policy,” Sponge said. “Convenient.” 
“And did you help him?” Tank 
again. It was hard to remember who 
said what, since they were all so 
murderously sharp. 

“Yes. I adapted a sonic instrument 
that enabled him to clean his teeth 
efficiently.” 

“And what was your professional 
fee for this service?” 

Dillingham reined his mounting 
temper. “Nothing. I was not thinking 
in such terms.” 

“A moment ago you were quite 
concerned about costs.” 

“I was concerned about unneces- 
sary expense to the patient. That 
strikes me as another matter.” 

“And the dinosaur told you about 
the University of Dentistry?” Sponge 
put in. 

“Yes, among other things. We con- 
versed quite a bit.” 

“And so you decided to attend, 
on hearsay evidence.” 

“That’s not fair!” 

“Is the color in your face a sign 
of distress?” 

D illingham realized that they were 
now deliberately needling him 
and shut up. Why should he allow 
himself to get excited over a minor 
slur, after passing over major ones? 
All he could do that way was prove 
he was unstable, and therefore unfit. 
“And did you seriously believe,” 



30 



IF 




Sponge persisted nastily, “that you 
had any chance at all to be admitted 
as a student here?” 

Again he had no answer. 

“On planet Electrolus you pro- 
voked a war by careless advice,” 
Honeycomb said. “Whereupon you 
conspired to be exiled — to this 
University. What kind of reception 
did you anticipate here, after such 
machinations?” 

So that was it! They resented the 
circumstances of his application. 
What use to explain that he had 
not schemed, that Trach had cleverly 
found a solution to the Electrolus 
problem that satisfied all parties? 
This trio would only twist that into 
further condemnation. 

“I made mistakes on that planet, as 
I did elsewhere,” he said at last. “I 
hoped to learn to avoid such errors 
in the future by enrolling in a cor- 
rective course of instruction. It was 
ignorance, not devious intent, that be- 
trayed me. I still think this University 
has much to offer me.” 

“The question at hand,” Tank 
said portentiously, “is what you have 
to offer the University. Have you 
any further statements you fancy 
might influence our decision?” 

“I gather from your choice of ex- 
pression that it has already been 
made. In that case I won’t waste any 
more of your time. I am ready for 
it.” 

“We find you unsuitable for en- 
rollment at this University as a stu- 
dent,” Tank said. “Please depart by 
the opposite door.” 

So as not to obstruct the incoming 
interviewees! Very neat. Dillingham 
stood up wearily. “Thank you for 



your consideration,” he said formally, 
keeping the irony out of his t«e. He 
walked to the iiidicated exit, 

“One moment, applicant,” Hmiey- 
comb said. “What are your present 
plans?” 

He wondered why the creature 
bothered to ask. “I suppose I’ll re- 
turn to practice wherever I’m needed 
— or wanted,” he said. “I may not 
be the finest dentist available, or 
even adequate by your standards — 
but I love my profession, and there 
is much I can still do.” But why was 
it that the thought of returning to 
Earth, which he was free to de now 
and where be was adequate, no 
longer appealed? Had the wenders 
he had glimpsed here spoiled him for 
the backwoods existence? “I would 
have preferred to add the University 
training to my experience; but there 
is no reason to give up what I al- 
ready have just because my dream 
has been denied.” 

He walked away from them. 

VIII 

T he hall did not lead to the familiar 
elevators. Instead, absent-mind- 
edly following the wrist-band glow, 
he found himself in an elegant apart- 
ment. He turned, embarrassed to 
have blundered into the wrong area, 
but a voice stopped him. 

“Please sit down, Earthman.” 

It was the old Oyster he had 
treated two days before. He was not 
adept at telling aliens of identical 
species apart, but he could not mis- 
take this one. “What are you do- 
ing here?” 

“We all have to dwell somewhere.”

Oyster indicated a couch adaptable 
to a wide variety of forms. ''Make 
yourself comfortable. I have thought^ 
to exchange with you.” 

Dillingham marveled at the change 
in his erstwhile patient. This was no 
longer a suffering, unreasonable indi- 
gent. Yet — 

“Surely it occurred to you, Doctor, 
that there are only three groups upon 
this planet? The applicants, the stu- 
dents — and the University person- 
nel Which of these do you suppose 
should lack proper dental care? 
Which should lack the typical Uni- 
versity identification?” 

“You — ” Dillingham stared at 
him, suddenly making connections. 
“You have no band — but the eleva- 
tor worked for you! It was a put-up 
job!’^ 

“It was part of your examination,” 
Oyster said. 

“I failed.” 

“What has given you that impres- 
sion?” 

“The Admissions Advisory Coun- 
cil found me unfit to enter this Uni- 
versity.” 

“You are mistaken.” 

Dillingham faced him angrily, not 
appreciating this business at “I 
don’t know who you are or why you 
were so determined to interfere with 
my application, but you succeeded 
nicely. They rejected me.” 

‘Terhaps we should verify this,” 
Oyster said, unperturbed. He spoke 
into the translator: “Summon Dr. Dil- 
lingham’s advisory subgroup.” 

They came — the Sponge, the 
Honeycomb, the Tank, riding low 
conveyors. “Sir,” they said respect- 
fully. 



“What was your decision with re- 
gard to this man’s application?” 
Tank replied. “We found this 
humanoid to be unsuitable for enroll- 
ment at this University as a student.” 

D illingham nodded. Whatever in- 
ternecine politics were going on 
here, at least that point was clear. 

“Did you discover this applicant 
to be deficient in integrity?” Oyster 
inquired softly. ' It was the gentle 
tone of complete authority. 

“No, sir,” Tank said. 
“Professional ethics?” - 
“No, sir.” 

“Professional caution?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Humility?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Temper control?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Compassion? Courage? Equili- 
brium?” 

“That is for you to say, sir.” 
Oyster glanced at Dillingham. “So 
it would seem. What, then, gentle- 
men, did you find the applicant 
suitable for?” 

“Administration, sir.” 

“Indeed. Dismissed, gentlemen.” 
“Yes, Director.” The three left 
hastily. 

Dillingham started. “Yes, whoT 
“There is, you see, a qualitative 
distinction between the potential 
manual trainee and the potential ad- 
ministrator,” Oyster said. “Your 
roommates were evaluated as students 
— and they certainly have things to 
learn. Oh, technically they are pro- 
ficient enough — quite skilled, in 
fact, though none had the opportunity 
to exhibit the depth of competence

manifested in adversity that you did. 
But in attitude — weU, there will be 
considerable improvement there, or 
they will hardly graduate from this 
school. I daresay you know what I 
mean.” 

“But — ” 

“We are equipped to inculcate 
mechanical dexterity and technical 
comprehension. Of course the tech- 
niques tested in the Admissions Ex- 
amination are primitive ones; none 
of them are employed in advanced 
restoration. Our interrogatory sched- 
ule is principally advisory, to enable 
us to program for individual needs. 

“Character, on the other hand, is 
far more difficult to train — or to 
assess accurately in a controlled situ- 
ation. It is far more reliable if it 
comes naturally, which is one reason 
we don’t always draw from gradu- 
ates, or even promising students. We 
are quite quick to investigate appli- 
cants possessing the personality traits 
we require, and this has nothing to 
do with planet or species. A promis- 
ing candidate may emerge from any 
culture, even the most backward, and 
is guaranteed from none. No statis- 
tical survey is reliable in pinpointing 
the individual we want. In exceptional 
cases, it becomes a personal matter, 
a nonobjective thing. Do you follow 
me?” 

D illingham’s mind was whirling. 

“It sounds almost as though 
you want me to — ” 

‘To undertake training at Univer- 
sity expense leading to the eventual 
assumption of my own position: Di- 
rector of the School of Prosthodon-

He was speechless standing there. 

“1 am anticipating a pronK)tkn, ^ 
you see,” Oyster confided. “The 
cancy I leave is my responsibilky. 1 ♦ 
would not suffer a successor to whett 
I would not trust the care of my ewa 
teeth.” 

“But I couldn’t possibly — I 
haven’t the — ” 

“Have no concern. You adapted 
beautifully when thrust from yeur 
protected environment into galactic 
society, and this will be no mm 
difficult. The University of Admm- 
istration has a comprehensive pro- 
gram that will guarantee your ccsa- 
petence for the position, and of 
course you will serve as my assistant 
for several years until you get the 
hang of it. We are not rushed. You 
wiU not be subjected to the ordeal 
unprepared; that unpleasantness is 
over.” 

Dillingham still found this hard 
to grasp. “Your grandson — what if 
I’d—” 

“I shaU have to introduce you 
more formally to that young security 
officer. He is not, unfortunately, »y 
grandson; but he is the finest shot 
with the single-charge laser on the 
planet. We try to make our little 
skits realistic.” 

Dillingham remembered the metal 
mallet dripping to the floor — so 
freak interception after all. And the 
way the youngster had retreated be- 
fore the tube . which, being sin- 
gle-shot, was no longer functional. 
Realism, yes. 

That reminded him. “That tooth 
of yours I filled. I know that 
wasn’t — ” 

“Wasn’t fake. You are correct. I

nursed that cavity along for three 
months, using it to check our pros- 
pects. It is a very good thing I won’t 
need it any more, because you spoil- 
ed it utterly.” 

“j — ” 

“You did such a professional job 
that I should have to have a new 
cavity cultured for my purpose. No 
experienced practitioner would mis- 
take it now for a long-neglected case 
even if 1 yanked out the gold and 
re-impacted it. ThaU Doctor, is the 
skill that impresses me — the skill 
that remains after the machinery is 
incapacitated. But of course that’s 
part of it; good intentions mean noth- 
ing unless backed by authoritative 
discretion and ability. You were very 
slow, but you handled that delib- 
erately obstructive patient very well. 
Had it been otherwise — ” 

“But why me? I mean, you could 
have select^ anyone — ” 

O yster put a friendly smile into 
his voice. “Hardly, Doctor. I 
visited eleven dormitories that eve- 



ning, before I came to yours — with 
no success. All contained prospects 
whose record and fieldwork showed 
the potential. You selected yourse^ 
from this number and carried it 
through honorably. More correctly, 
you presented yourself as a candidate 
for the office; we took it from there.” 
“You certainly didl” 

“Portions of your prior record 
were hard to believe, I admit. It 
was incredible that a person who had 
as little galactic background as you 
had should accomplish so much. But 
now we are satisfied that you do 
have the touch, the ability to do the 
right thing in an awkward or unfam- 
iliar situation. That, too, is essential 
for the position.” 

Dillingham fastened on one in- 
congruity. “I — I selected myself?** 
“Yes, Doctor. When you demon- 
strated your priorities.” 

“My priorities? I don’t — ” 

“When you sacrificed invaluable 
study time to offer assistance to a 
creature you believed was in pain.”

IF • Special Feature 



IF ... and WHEN 

by LESTER DEL REY 



Your child may not be an Earfhman! 



F ifteen years ago, science fiction 
dealt with a time when men 
would colonize the stars, while a 
few daring scientists wondered if 
interstellar flight might be possible. 
Today, most writers have become 
aware of the difficulties, and inter- 
stellar colonies are being treated in 
fiction as a fantasy somewhat akin 
to time travel. 

Now sane and sober scientists are 
planning seriously how we’ll make 
the trip — and the date they claim 
for this possibility is a lot closer 
than we dared dream. They’re not 
planning millenium-long flights like 
the one in Heinlein’s Universe, but 
trips that can be made in the life- 
time of a man, at speeds up to at 
least a quarter that of the velocity of 
light — or nearly fifty thousand 
miles a second. 

This was brought home to me at 
the 1967 Planetology and Space Sci- 



ences Meeting, held at the New York 
Academy of Sciences under the direc- 
tion of Dr. Robert Enzmann. The fi- 
nal sessiofi was a panel on what in- 
terstellar flight would mean; Murray 
Leinster, Frederik Pohl and I were 
among the writers exchanging ideas 
with working space scientists. Hard- 
ware wasn’t discussed, but when it 
was over Dr. E nzmann began des- 
cribing the plans and blueprints for 
the actual ship and flight. 

Some of the details are still shroud- 
ed in security wraps, since the power 
for the flight must be provided by 
atomic fusion, currently held back 
from development by some of our 
international agreements on the atom 
in space. However, successful experi- 
mental work on fusion drives has 
been done already, and several sys- 
tems have been worked out in theory. 
By the time work on the ship can 
be started, we can be pretty sure that 



35 




the power to drive us at high speed 
to the stars will be available. 

Every other detail of this con- 
stantly evolving Project Orion — as 
it is code-named — depends on hard- 
ware and techniques that could be 
available to us today. Given official 
permission and funds, the construc- 
tion of the first star ship could begin 
immediately. 

The cost of the Project is esti- 
mated at a staggering hundred billion 
dollars. That may come down as the 
normal development of planetary 
space missions improves our hard- 
ware, but it will still be an expen- 
sive proposition. (In passenger miles 
flown, it’s the greatest bargain of all 
time; one dollar will pay for 30,000 
passenger miles I) 

Spread over a decade, however, 
the annual cost is less than twice 
what we’re spending to get to the 
Moon; or less than one-thirtieth what 
it cost us to fight in Vietnam. Over 
a fifteen-year period — a logical 
span for the Project — this repre- 
sents only one per cent of our present 
gross national product. 

O rion is going to be a true space- 
ship. That means it will never 
be launched from or landed on the 
surface of a planet. For its flight, 
a steady acceleration of half a gravity 
or less will be adequate; and since it 
will be assembled in space, free of 
the pressure of planetary gravity, it 
can be built to take far less strain 
than anything we’ve built so far. 
Logically, its design takes advantage 
of this to save mass. 

Fuel for the trip will be deuterium. 
A number of plans have been worked 



out to send scoops into the atmos- 
phere of Jupiter and collect hydro- 
gen, which can then be isotopically 
separated to yield pure deuterium — 
the form of hydrogen which has dou- 
ble normal weight and is suitable for 
fusion power. (Interestingly, a paper 
was read at the meeting on ac- 
cumulating such fuel from Jupiter 
for normal flights to Pluto or beyond, 
where the advantages seem doubt- 
ful.) The ship will either be built 
near Jupiter; or it will be assembled 
near Earth and towed out to Jupiter 
to build up its tremendous supply 
of deuterium. 

The ship currently suggested is a 
cylinder, four thousand feet in 
diameter, sheathed in three separate 
layers of thin metal. Inside the 
sheathing, it is a honeycomb of 
smaller cylinders packed together to 
contribute lengthwise strength; each 
is capable of maintaining its own life 
support system and protection against 
space. The cylinders are filled with 
thin-walled metal spheres, which 
again supply protection and in which 
the actud living quarters will be 
built. 

Actually, the main cylinder is com- 
posed of three separate shorter cylin- 
ders which are joined together; each 
will have its own crew, operating 
controls and maintenance system. If 
any one should be hopelessly dam- 
aged, the other two can link together 
or proceed independently on the trip. 

The fuel is carried as a great ball 
ahead of the ship, so that the whole 
looks like a monstrous candy apple 
on a very fat stick. It is this ball of 
fuel which also provides the main 
protection for the occupants. 



36 



IF 




Once beyond the solar system, the 
danger of any sidewise hit by mete^ 
oric rubble is small; and the probable 
speed of such rubble will not be 
dangerous for more than a small 
section of the ship. However, at 
speeds in thousands of miles per sec- 
ond, a frontal impact could be dis- 
astrous. Here, the fuel acts as a 
great bumper; some fuel may be lost, 
but the ship itself is protected against 
penetration. 

T he ship will start with perhaps 
5000 people, and breeding may 
double this number before arrival. 
There is ample room. The ship has 
a volume of two billion cubic feet, or 
200,000 cubic feet for each passen- 
ger; since a good-sized house has 
only one-tenth that volume for an 
entire family, the adequacy of space 
seems clear enough, even allowing 
for all necessary supplies and ma- 
chinery. 

Supplies will be in a closed cycle, 
anyhow. Air will be used by the 
men and replenished by growing 
plants, as will water and wastes. This 
will be a small world, recycling 
everything as our planet does, with 
almost no limit to the theoretical 
time it can spend in space. 

The trip may take up to fifty 
years to complete. That is a large 
time to cut out of the life of the 
original volunteers, of course; and 
the velocity will be still too low for 
any major contraction effect on the 
passage of time to be noted aboard; 
but there may be other ways to de- 
crease the aging of the passengers. 
Work has been done indicating that 
many non-hibemating animals can 



be made to hibernate by temperature 
and hormone manipulation. If this 
can be adapted for human hiberna- 
tion, aging time can be decreased 
greatly. At a body temperatiire of 
46® Fahrenheit, a month will age 
a man no more than a normal day., 
By rotating the hibernating and 
working staff, most of the volun- 
teers might reach their destination 
apparently no more than ten or fif- 
teen years older than they left. 

They will never be cut off from 
contact with Earth, of course. There 
will be no mutiny from those who 
lose faith in the home world. Radio 
and television contact will not re- 
quire inordinate amounts of power, 
and even our present capabilities 
can handle this. There will be a time 
lag as the ship nears its destination, 
but this will not destroy the value 
of what is on the screen from Earth, 
even though they’ll literally only see 
old movies — as much as a decade 
older than when broadcast. 

They will also receive constant 
news of what lies ahead. Unmanned 
probes will have explored the nearer 
stars for a suitable goal, and an- 
other such probe will precede them 
by a light-month, or so — the dis- 
tance light travels in one month. 
This will warn them in time if there 
should be any serious amount of 
rubble in their path that might threa- 
ten them for instance. 

They will be paying their way, 
incidentally. As they move out be- 
tween the stars, they will be able to 
make observations in space that will 
be invaluable to Earth. 

The trip will cover somewhere 
between five and ten light-years, 



IF . AND WHEN 



37 




probably. There is evidence now that 
many stars near us have planets, and 
at least one should be suitable. At 
worst, there are two favorable goals 
within about eleven light-years — 
Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, al- 
ready selected as probably habitable. 

Contact will not be lost when they 
reach their destination, either. Earth 
will want to know everything dis- 
coverable about the world around an- 
other sun — and the knowledge may 
well be worth the cost of Project 
Orion ten times over. 

N obody can be sure of what they 
will find. But it isn’t expected 
that there ^ill be a green and lovely 
world waiting for them. These will 
be chosen as hardy pioneers, and 
their children will be prepared. They 
will go down to the planet they find 
in ferry ships that have been car- 
ried along. And there will still be 
power available for at least a genera- 
tion from the fuel still not used. 

They must find a solar system 
with two things; one is a world at 
least as habitable as our Moon. TTiis 
will enable them to set up a base, 
just as the Moon itself can be forced 
into a base for human life by plans 
already familiar to science-fiction 
readers. 

And they will need a gas-giant 
planet, one like Jupiter or Saturn. 
This will provide them with fresh 
supplies of fuel whenever they want 
it. The ship will still have its re- 
fining equipment and enough fuel to 
cruise easily across planetary dis- 
tance. 

With a system having this mini- 
mum, the colonists can at least resup- 



ply themselves. They can even build 
a second ship for their excess popu- 
lation, if necessary. And they can 
then go on to explore, another sys- 
tem; it will be one previously explor- 
ed from Earth by probe, probably. 
Their first trip will not be a waste. 
If they find a planet better than this 
minimum, they can settle in and 
become another branch of humanity. 

And that, of course, is the true 
reason for the trip. So long as man 
is isolated upon a single world, there 
can be no safety for the race. Any 
cosmic or man-made disaster might 
wipe us all out. 

With two or more bases, the 
chances of ultimate survival are vast- 
ly greater. And since we can be 
reasonably sure that this will not 
be the only colonizing trip, we can 
hope for many such bases. After 
all, the ship in orbit will still be 
ready to go onwards, even if the 
planet can prove suitable for a 
colony. Once that colony is well 
started, they will need no hundred 
billion dollars to send out another 
branch; the ship will be ready and 
the task greatly simplified. 

It can be done, according to many 
serious scientists. And as many of 
them see it, it must be done. 

It lies within our capabilities to 
begin that first flight to another 
star by the end of this century, if 
not sooner! That means that some 
young child alive today may^ have 
a chance to go on the first trip be- 
yond the Sun we know, to plant his 
steps on a truly alien planet, and to 
look back across space to the star 
that was once — but is no more — 
the sole home of humanity. END

IF • Short Story 




The Other Land was clean, fragrant 
and a fit place for Man to live . 
quite unlike the weary world. Earth! 



W hen I woke up, I thought I was 
dead. That’s what I had in- 
tended to be. 

My head was pounding as though 
someone had been kicking it around 
a football field. My eyes were burn- 
ing, and my throat was dry, but the 
palms of my hands were wet with 
sweat. I felt awful. 

I was lying in the darkness — a 
warm darkness that was absolute. I 
knew I was lying on my stomach be- 
cause my face was pressed into . 
soil? There was sand in my mouth. I 
must have dreamt I was in a park, 
because I woke up convinced that I 
was. 

I was lying on a small, roughly 



oval-shaped patch of damp, clean, 
sandy earth. At the edge of the bare 
ground there were clumps of grace- 
ful, silky grass with the seed heads 
not yet ripe. Beyond that and tower- 
ing up all around me was a profusion 
of incredibly green trees, beneath 
them, a forest floor of countless liv- 
ing plants. 

In college — when I had been in 
college, that is — botany had been 
one of the few subjects I’d done well 
in. But I wished that I could remem- 
ber more of it. I thought if I could 
identify a few of the trees I would 
have some idea what part of the state, 
or even the country, I was in. 

It couldn’t be a park; they mowed 



39 





the grass in parks. Besides, they didn’t 
just dump dangerously deranged peo- 
ple in parks and leave them. Well, are 
“funny farms” really farms . ? 
Wherever I was, I knew they would 
be after me. 

After a while I felt a little better. 
The sky was growing brighter with 
daylight, but I couldn’t see the sun. 
Was it still behind the trees? I began 
to walk slowly through the woods. As 
I got deeper in among the trees I 
could hardly see the sky through the 
intense green canopy. The air was 
gratifyingly cool. 

I was amazed at the beauty of the 
vegetation which carpeted the ground. 
It was an Eden — like an imagined 
paradise of gleaming leaves and lacey 
flowers. 

I walked for — well, my wrist 
watch was gone, but I think it was 
for at least ten or fifteen minutes. 
Finally I realized what was wrong. 
There were no sounds or signs of life; 
no insects, no birds, nothing. A faint 
breeze had picked up and was ruf- 
fling and rustling the leaves, but ex- 
cept for myself no living thing stirred. 

Then I began to give more thought 
to where I could be. 

T he last place I remembered being, 
of course, was the power station. 
I couldn’t be in New York any more; 
nearly the entire state was the vast 
megalopolis of New York City, and 
there was hardly a tree left there, 
much less a beautiful forest. In fact, 
I couldn’t imagine anywhere in the 
entire country where such a place as 
this could exist, so untouched by hu- 
man degradation. Was I in South 
America then? 



An IF First 

Each month /F brings you a "first" story 
by a writer who has never had a science- 
fiction story published before. This month's 
''first" is AAary Urhousen, a 20-year-oW 
sophomore at the University of Wisconsin 
(Racine Center). Mary's interests ore 
horses, veterinary ntedicine, science, fiction 
and science fiction. She's a member of the

a talented young lady who will go far. 



I came across a path, a very neat 
little lane weaving among the trees. 
I looked for footprints or tracks of 
any kind, but the damp, sandy earth 
was packed so hard that even my own 
shoes left scarcely a mark. Above 
the path the tree canopy was parted, 
and I could see the vivid blue of the 
sky. I picked the left path at random 
and started along it. 

I was feeling pretty good now; my 
head didn’t hurt any more and I was 
even getting hungry again. Actually, 
it was amazing I wasn’t more serious- 
ly injured. Outside of the blow to my 
head and my scorched and ragged 
clothing, I had survived suicide ad- 
mirably — or should I say damnably? 

If only it weren’t for that infernal 
silence. Had fallout killed the insects 
and animals? It had been rumored the 
Venezuelans had used the bomb 
against Brazil, but that war was over. 
Wasn’t it? Had there been a plague? 
I didn’t know. The papers never let 
us read about things like that any 
more; things like plague or murder 
or . suicide. Things like that 
weren’t supposed to happen. 

Ahead of me the path fanned out 
and suddenly I was out of the forest

entirely, standing on a level grassy 
plain — and staring in amazement. 

The land was like a large meadow, 
resplendent with short, brilliant green 
grass and millions of small flowers 
scattered throughout it like colorful 
gems. About an eighth mile from me 
out on the meadow there stood a city. 

It was a complex of incredibly 
graceful and unusual buildings, ar- 
ranged on a huge, circular, paved 
courtyard — like an architect’s mod- 
els assembled on a big plate. All of 
the buildings were constructed of 
what appeared to be smooth white 
stone and had large, round, porthole- 
like windows. The largest building 
stood in the center of the circle, rising 
far above its fellows. It was an ellip- 
tical shaft and contained periodic 
rows of the round windows, which 
probably marked the presence of 
floors or stories. There were about a 
dozen other buildings, all beautifully 
designed. One was circular shaped; 
another mimicked the form of a 
bird’s spreading wings. Others were 
shaped with sloping spires and domes. 

It was such a simple, bold, pleas- 
ing arrangement. I thought ruefully of 
my cramped and coarse New York; 
of the gigantic megalopolis sprawling 
for mile after ravenous mile under a 
shroud of fumes and smoke; of life 
that had become worse than death in 
its crowded, crumbling streets — 

And here the air was so clean that 
it hurt my lungs, and the sunlight re- 
flecting off the windows and the 
smooth, bright, stone walls of the 
buildings made me squint. My legs 
felt weak, and I was surprised to feel 
sweat trickling across my stomach. 

Then I saw the people. 



There were three of them, and they 
were strolling — yes, I swear they 
were just strolling, flagrantly loiter- 
ing — along the edge of the paved 
area to the right of the buildings. 
Then one of them paused, pointed at 
me; and they began to come toward 
me. 

This was getting ridiculous. Why 
didn’t they just take me away and 
lock me up — whisk me up with the 
almighty, omnipresent, ever-right bu- 
reaucratic hand and put me where I 
couldn’t harm anyone — including 
myself? What was I doing here? Why 
the cat and mouse game? 

It was at once both pathetic and 
absurd; three men — women? They 
had long hair, shoulder-length at 
least, and wore long, loosely-fitting 
robes in pastel shades and delicate 
floral prints. 

One of them seemed to be carry- 
ing something under the robe on one 
arm, but I couldn’t see well because 
the sun was — the suns were — 

By the time they were within a 
hundred yards of me. I’d had it. None 
of this sleep business; this time I 
know I fainted. 

I was lying on my back on some- 
thing comfortably contoured to 
my weary body, and for some damp, 
cool, intangible reason my eyes were 
closed, and I could not see. The mur- 
mur of their voices was strangely 
reassuring, like the gentle hum of the 
air-conditioning units which dominat- 
ed and sustained every building I 
could ever remember. They weren’t 
speaking English. 

Slowly I opened my eyes, afraid of 
what I -might see. Good God — was 



IN ANOTHER LAND 



41 




I so sick or had I really seen two 
suns? 

I was lying on a tall, couch-like 
bed, and several of the people were 
bent anxiously over me. The one 
nearest my head observed my waking 
and lifted a hand. I cringed. 

He — well, I thought it was a 
man: a man with shoulder-length 
chestnut hair, bottomless brown eyes, 
graceful features, and an absurd blue 
robe — he spoke reassuringly to me 
in that soft tongue I could not under- 
stand. When I sagged back against 
the couch, he reached out and lifted 
the damp cloth from my forehead, 
nodding gently at me. 

Four others stood behind or beside 
the chestnut-haired one. I think three 
of them were the ones I’d seen from 
the meadow; at least the robes — yel- 
low, pale orange, and a sort of green 
and gold floral print — were the 
same. The other one I hadn’t seen 
before. 

Were they men or women anyway? 
They had delicate, sensitive, mobile 
faces, neither definitely feminine or 
masculine. Their eyes were large, 
dark, and luminous, their features fine 
and pleasant. Oddly enough, I 
thought of a setter I’d once owned — 
before the Council declared all dogs 
superfluous and obsolete, that is. She 
had that same expression: attentive, 
thoughtful, responsive. All of them 
wore their hair long, the length rang- 
ing from several inches to silky manes 
that flowed down around Aeir shoul- 
ders. Their hair, as their simple cloth- 
ing, was unadorned. The robes fell 
to their ankles, and they wore flat, 
open sandals on their small feet. One 
of them carried two purple flowers in 



his — her? — hand. All of them 
regarded me with concern and polite 
curiosity. 

I bolted upright into a sitting posi- 
tion, startling them, and my voice 
came out like a scream. 

“Where am I!? What are you doing 
to me?” 

I t hink they were a little fri^tened 
by the outburst, some of them any- 
way. Several took steps backward, 
their eyes watchful, their arms in 
protective poses across their robes. 

The chestnut-haired one reached 
slowly out and touched my arm; on 
his face was a look of such sheer 
compassion and reassurance that my 
desperate utterance ceased immediate- 
ly. He spoke quietly and earnestly, 
motioning to me with his other hand 
as if I should follow him. 

If it was all a vast Council plot, 
they already had me where they 
wanted me; trapped and on the verge 
of hysteria. I was too weary and 
frightened to resist. I got to my feet 
and followed him, my legs unsteady 
and sluggish in their obedience. 

We went out a doorway into a 
long, curving corridor that followed 
the outside of the building and was 
lined on the right side with a row of 
the big porthole windows. I was in 
the tall, elliptical building, I guess; 
far below, the smooth white wings of 
the other structures spread against the 
backdrop of the paving and the green 
of the meadows. My mind was con- 
vulsed with loneliness and confusion. 

As if he sensed my despair, the 
chestnut-haired one squeezed my arm 
encouragingly and pointed at a closed 
door to the left One of the others 
pressed a button on the wall, much as 



42 



IP 




one would ring a doorbell. The door 
slid open with a soft hiss. 

The interior of the room was so 
gloomy that I could barely see. I re- 
sisted, hanging back obstinately, but 
the chestnut-haired one gestured at 
me and tugged on my arm until I 
stumbled through the doorway. The 
room had a breath, a pulse, a vibra- 
tion of its own that made it like a 
Hying thing; but it was so dark that I 
could not see the walls or even the 
floor, and I was frightened. 

The chestnut-haired one was speak- 
ing quietly, not to me but to one of 
the others. I tried to cry out, but he 
was pushing me gently and firmly 
forward. They were placing some- 
thing on my head; then my brain felt 
like it was freezing, and my eyeballs 
bulged in their sockets. I tried to 
struggle but I was unable to free my- 
self from the cold grayness that was 
invading my mind. And, for the third 
time since my awakening in this 
strange world, I lost consciousness 
again. 

I felt groggy, and it was hard to 
awaken. I opened my eyes in a 
small, bright room; I was lying on 
... a bed, I guess. The chestnut- 
haired one was nearby, seated on a 
fat, stool-like chair. 

“Listen,” I said weakly, “someone’s 
got to tell me what’s happening,” 
“Of course,” the chestnut-haired 
one said — in fluent, fluid English. 
“Do you feel all right now?” 

“So you do speak English!” I ex- 
claimed incredulously. 

“No. Now you speak our lan- 
guage,” 

I stared at him. 



“We have supplemented your 
knowledge,” he explained, “in the 
dark room. We use it sometimes, for 
children born with . unfinished 
minds.” 

The explanation strangely satisfied 
me. It did nothing for my other fears 
and questions, however. 

“W-where am I? What am I doing 
here?” 

“You’re here, in the Life Build- 
ing,” the chestnut-haired one replied, 
his voice polite and concerned. “They 
found you when you lost your aware- 
ness, out by the Tree Land. They 
thought you might be hurt, and 
brought you here.” 

“But where is this? Am I on Coun- 
cil property any more?” I was tread- 
ing thin ice and keenly aware of it, 
but I was driven even in my despera- 
tion to find out. 

The chestnut-haired one shook his 
head. “I do not know what this Coun- 
cil is. You are in our land now.” 
“I-I’m not in South America?” 

“No. That is a place in your land, 
isn’t it?” His voice was sympathetic. 
“But you are in another land now.” 
Then I had seen two suns? Or was 
I very, very insane? 

“VVTiere is this?” I asked, my voice 
barely above a hoarse whisper. “Who 
are you?” 

“My name is Psilote. You come 
from a land that you call Earth. We 
do not know of this land or where it 
is, or what has brought you to us.” 
God, how could I beheve what he 
said? It was a hoax, a fraud — a 
monstrous and cruel trick of the 
damned Council! And yet, if it was 
true .... To admit that possibility 
seemed tantamount to admitting my

own insanity. Out in that forest I had 
thought I was either dead or insane 
and wished for either fate without 
misgivings. But now it was different 
— and I was afraid. 

“You are troubled,” Psilote said 
softly; his obvious concern was over- 
powering. “This Council, it is not in 
our land. It can not harm you.” 

My shoulders slumped. I stifled the 
urge to flee from him. To where 
could I flee? I cleared my throat 
awkwardly, but my voice didn’t come 
out very loudly anyway. 

“Last I remember, I was in New 
York City, at the Third Street power 
station. I threw myself onto the gen- 
erator grid. I was trying to commit 
suicide.” Did he understand the 
word? “I was trying to kill myself.” 
Psilote was silent for so long that 
I wondered if he’d understood what 
I’d said. I looked up at his face and 
I saw that he had indeed understood; 
his expression of simple and honest 
empathy touched me like a warm 
hand. How much did he know about 
me from that — that room? Or could 
he read my very thoughts? 

“We did not bring you here,” he 
said softly, “nor can we understand 
the peculiar warping of time and 
space which combined in your land 
to bring you to us. But you flung 
yourself onto a generator grid, hoping 
for death. Whatever power has 
brought you here instead, I would like 
to think it is the kinder one.” 

I thought I was losing my mind. 

Where in heaven’s name could 
this place be, where men nearly wept 
at the thought of a person dying? 
Where a death didn’t merely mean 



more space, more food, more air. 
Psilote had said I was in another land. 
How right he was! 

He led me along another portion of 
the curving hall, to a sort of elevator 
that whisked us down to the ground 
level. I followed him across the paved 
courtyard and toward the circular 
building. The suns made the white 
stone gleam like alabaster. Psilote’s 
sandals plopped gently across the 
smooth flagstones. I glanced down at 
my -own feet; my shoes were terribly 
shoddy, and one was untied. 

Several of the others were standing 
outside of the circular building. I 
recognized the one with the shy eyes 
and the orange robe, and she — I 
think — smiled guardedly at me. 

Psilote nodded a pleasant greeting 
to them and reached out to take my 
arm and pull me a little closer. 

An older one, with dark hair be- 
ginning to become streaked with gray, 
stared candidly at me. Then he turn- 
ed to Psilote. 

“Whose bud is he, Psilote? I did 
not think there were mutants any 
more.” 

They all burst into merry laughter. 
I was not sure what the joke was, but 
I didn’t like being the butt of it. For 
the first time since I’d met these 
people, I stopped being scared long 
enough to be angry. 

I seized Psilote by the shoulders; I 
was surprised at how fragile he felt 
beneath that flowing robe. “Listen, 
you long-haired freak!” I shouted. 
“What’s so damned funny about me?” 

He was like a rag doll in my 
hands; nonresistance was an under- 
statement. The others, utterly silent 
now, viewed my outburst with ob- 



IF 




vious distress, but made no attempt 
to intervene. I stared at Psilote, who 
hung limply from my hands, and 1 
was overcome with a deep shame. I 
released him and stepped back, acute- 
ly aware of the surprise and concern 
that greeted my actions. 

“I’m sorry,” Psilote said quietly — 
why did he have to say he was sorry? 
“We weren’t trying to make fun of 
you. I know you are still upset.” 

“I — I’m sorry,” I echoed stupidly, 
because there was nothing else I 
could say. 

Psilote touched me gently on the 
arm. His dark brown eyes went right 
through me in a way that made me 
feel helpless and ashamed. Good 
God, how could he care so much 
about me? I was a maniac! 

Their silence melted rapidly into 
smiles, and then Psilote introduced 
me. 

“This is Dewan.” The older one, 
apparently he commanded first cour- 
tesies. “And Rella.” Blond hair — the 
first I’d seen here; somehow Rella 
looked like neither a man nor a 
woman. “And Trewlis.” This one 
had to be a man; very pleasant eyes 
— they literally sparkled. “And this 
is Camphos.” Camphos was the 
orange-robed one, a girl I was cer- 
tain. She had very long brown hair 
and shy hazel eyes. Something about 
her own timidity bolstered me. 

I realized that Psilote was looking 
at me with inquiry on his face. Oh — 
of course! “Uh — I’m Jordan. Ed- 
ward Jordan,” I stammered. At least 
I thought I was. 

“Edward Jordan,” Psilote mouthed 
the name pleasantly. “Come, Edward 
Jordan, we will eat.” 



The interior of the circular build- 
ing was one big room, like an audi- 
torium or a meeting hall. Its polished 
floor dropped off in degrees, like 
huge, ring-shaped steps leading down 
to a large central circle about six feet 
below ground level. On the bottom 
circle was an array of tables^ benches, 
and couch-like chairs, many made of 
wood, others of the snaooth white 
stone. (Where had all this white stone 
come from anyway? I hadn’t seen so 
much as a pebble outside.) The tables 
were littered with trays of fniit and 
delicate bakery, and tall goblets of 
some sort of drink. A few people 
were eating; many others were loung- 
ing casually about on the couches or 
on the stone steps themselves. The 
varying colors of their garments 
swirled like a muted rainbow. If they 
were curious about my presence, very 
few of them showed it by even so 
much as a glance. 

I had expected the food to be very 
exotic and strange, but it was rather 
plain — delicious but not exceptional. 
The fruits were very similar to peach- 
es and bananas (if you can imagine 
pink bananas). The bakery was like 
a sweet roll; the drink was a fruit 
juice. I ate ravenously. 

There was only one goblet. I had 
assumed it was for me, but then Psi- 
lote drank from it and pushed it at 
me with the urging, “Drink; it is 
good.” 

I drank. It was good. 

Trewlis had gotten up from one of 
the couches and was walking up the 
steps. I had noticed a peculiarity in 
his movement, a sort of odd gesture 
of protectiveness with his left arm 
against his robe.

“Can I ask something?” I asked 
Psllote cautiously. 

He smiled. “Of course.” 

“It’s Trewlis. Has he hurt his arm? 
He holds it oddly.” 

“No, Trewlis is not injured. He is 
carrying a child.” 

I n stories they sometimes say a per- 
son’s mouth drops open in sur- 
prise. Mine did. I stared stupidly at 
him. 

He, she, his, her ... I suddenly 
realized these sexual pronouns had no 
meaning in the language I was speak- 
ing. They were a hangover in my 
mind. I was using them on the basis 
of rather sketchy visual impressions, 
and Psilote was using them only be- 
cause I was. 

Sweat was prickling between my 
shoulderblades. “Then — you mean 
Trewlis is a — a woman?”* I asked 
weakly. “And if he is — are you?” 
“No, Edward Jordan,” Psilote re- 
plied quietly, “we are not women. We 
are the bud people. Not men. Not 
women. We are all one sex — or 
rather, we are all no sex.” 

“But — how?” 

Psilote shrugged slightly. “You 
have seen how Trewlis sometimes 
supports his child; it is large now, it 
will be born soon. The buds grow like 
fruit on a tree, attached to the trunks 
of our bodies by a meristematic band 
of tissue bound in ligamentous sup- 
ports. They are functionally embryos 
in all stages of their development. 
Their movements and demands are 
slight, and they are seldom a burden. 
When they are mature enough for in- 
dependence from our bodies, the 
tough band binding them to us dehy- 



drates, and they are freed.” His eyes 
were filled with a subtle humor. “It 
leaves a very small scar. I would 
recommend budding to any species.” 

“You say you are all no sex,” I 
repeated, more for my own edifica- 
tion than anything else, “yet it seems 
to me that some of you — well, some 
look more like men and some look 
like women. Camphos — I thought 
Camphos was a girl. And I thought 
you and Trewlis were men.” 

Psilote smiled. “Even in a sexual 
species, some males appear effeminate 
and some females have masculine 
characteristics. Because of our physi- 
cal variances, these superficial im- 
pressions of masculinity and feminin- 
ity do exist. Do not be embarrassed.” 
He laughed. “1 rather fancy being as- 
sumed a man.” 

Psilote’s expression become serious, 
and he got to his feet. “Come, Ed- 
ward Jordan,” he said. “There is 
something you must see.” 

I stood up and followed him up 
the huge circular steps, where gentle, 
genderless people in beautiful robes 
lounged, eating and laughing and car- 
rying their strange and wondrous 
children close against their warm 
bodies. Could I be dead? It bothered 
me to think that I might be dead — 
lying charred and broken by the gen- 
erator grid in my other land — and 
not even know it. Or was I just finally 
insane? No, my new knowledge was 
too painfully fresh for that. Insanity 
is painless; reality stings and you can 
feel it’s there. 

Psilote led me out across the paved 
courtyard, between the graceful white 
buildings, and into the meadow. The 
twin suns were straight overhead now, 



46 



IF 




and the warmth of their rays soaked 
through my shoulders. Psilote was 
beside me, his long blue robe billow- 
ing gently and brushing along over 
the tops of the short, silky grass. 

We came to the edge of the forest. 

I could hear faint laughter, shout- 
ing. It was like — well, like children 
playing. Psilote paused, smiled, mo- 
tioned. 

I stepped forward. Below and be- 
yond spread a small wooded ravine; 
in it, children of all ages and sizes, 
clad in brightly-colored robes, romp- 
ed and sang among the knee-high 
vegetation, playing games so simple 
and exquisite that my eyes burned 
with my own memories. 

I turned back to Psilote. “Are they 
— safe? I mean, out here by them- 
selves like this?” 

Psilote seemed puzzled. “What 
would harm them? They are children; 
we let them play.” 

W e had walked about twenty 
minutes (I was going to miss 
my wrist watch) when we reached 
our destination. It was a small build- 
ing, nearly hidden by a tangle of 
flowering vines and the hanging 
branches of the surrounding trees. 
Unlike the buildings in the complex 
in the meadow, it was not made of 
white stone, but of some sort of metal 
that was dull and tarnished with age. 
There seemed to be no windows and 
only one door. 

I looked questioningly at Psilote, 
but he stepped up to the oblong metal 
door and turned the handle; the door 
grated open with a dry squeak. Psilote 
went through the doorway, beckon- 
ing for me to follow. 



The place was one big storage 
chamber. The walls were lined with 
files and cabinets, and there was a 
large, desk-like table in the center of 
the single room. Psilote touched a 
panel on the wall, and the glow of a 
soft light crept into the room. 

“We keep things here,” he ex- 
plained, going over to one of the 
metal cabinets, “things that are im- 
portant for some other time and are 
not necessary to keep close at hand.” 
He pulled open a drawer; it rasped 
stiffly. “I do not care much for met- 
als,” he noted, “but he insisted it be 
metal.” 

Psilote handed me what appeared 
to be a fat, bound notebook. It was 
old, and the paper was yellowed and 
crisp. I set it gingerly on the table and 
opened it to a random page. I stared 
in puzzlement at the writing fcwr sev- 
eral moments before I suddenly real- 
ized what it was. 

“This is written in English I” I ex- 
claimed. “Where did you get this?!” 

Psilote nodded toward the note- 
book. “Look at h,” he said quietly. 

I carefully separated the cover from 
the first page and opened the note- 
book there. “ ‘Journsd of Robert As- 
cot Lemming,’ ” I read slowly. “ To 
whom it may concern: If you are 
reading this, you are in this other 
land. These are the bud people — be 
like them, if you can.’” I flipped a 
page. There was a date. “ ‘July 24, 
1911. This was the morning I woke 
up in another world — ’ ” I broke off 
and swung to Psilote, astounded. 

“There’s been someone else? This 
Lemming?” Psilote nodded. 

“But 1911 — that was over a hun- 
dred years ago!” 



IN ANOTHER LAND

“Yes, and it was before my life. 
But this Robert Ascot Lemming was 
also brought here, as you have been, 
from this land Earth. He was an old 
man and he did not live long; but he 
left these writings, his ‘journal,’ of the 
time he spent here. This is what we 
felt you should see. We were told he 
left it in case . another of his kind 
came.” 

I spread my hands protectively Over 
the faded notes. “Can I read this?” 
I asked hopefully. 

Psilote smiled at my caution. “Of 
course,” he said. “There are other 
books like it, also of Robert Ascot 
Lemming’s writings. They are all for 
you.” 

“They’ll be safe here?” 

“Of Course; they have been for 
over a hundred years. You may come 
any time to read them.” 

“Tomorrow?” 

“Certainly.” Psilote touched my 
shoulder. “Come, the others will won- 
der where we are. Myfair’s bud was 
born yesterday; there will be a cele- 
bration.” 

What did they do to celebrate? Get 
tanked up on pink banana juice? Loll 
about on their beautiful stone steps 
and smoke grass? Or jiist . sing 
and things — things of piercing sweet- 
ness like the songs of their brightly- 
robed children, playing in the quiet 
green forest .... 

T he Director stared at the body on 
the steel-frame bed, then leaned 
forward and flipped up the report 
sheet attached to the railing. 

“‘Jordan, Edward D.,’” he read 
dispassionately. He turned to the as- 
sistant. “What’s this one here for?” 



“The usual, sir. Suicide attempt.” 
The Director stared again at the 
motionless form on the bed, garbed 
in a hideous khaki gown. “Humph,” 
the Director grunted. “Which did you 
give him?” 

“8-A, sir; the one with the asexual 
species in their little Eden-like world. 
It’s proved the most satisfactory — 
the most soothing — for cases like 
his, where the problem was a wom- 
an.” The assistant glanced at the 
body. “Now he can ‘spend’ the rest 
of his life there.” 

“Humph,” the Director grunted 
again. “Who ever invented this damn 
dream therapy anyway?” 

“Well, it’s quite a serviceable solu- 
tion, sir. What else can we do with 
them — the senile, the incorrigibles, 
the manic depressives? We could 
hardly keep exterminating them; the 
public was catching on to that and 
raising the very dickens. It’s too ex- 
pensive to institutionalize all of them 
in the conventional sense. They’re un- 
fit to be trained for anything. With a 
perpetual, induced dream state, their 
organic needs are relatively simple to 
care for — and they’re far happier 
than they could ever be in this real 
world, I daresay.” 

The Director poked Edward Jor- 
dan’s body’s leg and watched for a 
reaction that never came. “You 
mean,” he continued, “he actually 
thinks he’s in that kooky other world, 
running around with all those freaky 
people?” 

The assistant smiled shortly. “Well, 
sir, they don’t seem freaky to him 
any more; he’s gone through his per- 
iod of adjustment, and by now he’s 
perfectly content. But yes, for all 



48 



IF 




practical purposes he is in that other 
world — and will be for the rest of 
his life. By selective use of psycho- 
surgery and drugs, we can implant in 
his subconscious mind any patterned 
dream we choose to program him 
with. It becomes his real life, body 
and spirit, and no one can interfere 
with it. Take 8-A, for example. We 
do introduce a few outside forces; the 
journal of a ‘former resident,’ to 
make him feel a bit more secure. 
But other than that he can live the 
rest of his days happy, safe, loved, 
in ‘another land’.” 

The Director turned away, and the 
assistant fell into step beside him as 
they went through the silent ward, 
filled with the motionless, unfeeling 
bodies of dreamers. 

“There is one puzzling little item 
on that Jordan case, however, sir,” 
the assistant volunteered. 

“And what’s that?” the Director 
said gruffly. 

“Well, he tried to kill himself down 



at the Third Street power station, sir; 
threw himself onto the generator 
grid.” 

“What’s puzzling about that?” the 
Director snapped. 

“All of the generator grids have a 
safety shut-down; all it did was give 
him a bad jolt. He’d have to trip up 
the relay wires before it would have 
killed him. You’d think he would 
have remembered that, sir; he’d work- 
ed at that power station for eleven 
years.” 

“Humph,” said the Director. 

T hat night they carried another un- 
conscious body out of the Third 
Street power station. The coded in- 
structions which the assistant receiv- 
ed with the patient recommended that 
5-A would probably be the most ben- 
eficial treatment. But the assistant 
stared in surprise at the motionless, 
khaki-clad body. 

It was the Director.

J ohn Grimes was really homeward 
bound at last. 

On both Tharn and Mellise he had 
been obliged to leave the ships in 
which he had taken passage when re- 
quested by the rulers of those planets 



to assist them in the solution of rath- 
er complicated problems. He had not 
minded at all; he had welcomed the 
prospect of action after too long a 
time as a desk-borne Commodore. 
But now he was beginning to become 
a little impatient. Sonya, his wife, 
would be back soon from her Galac- 



51 




tic cruise, and then the major city of 
Lorn would be — as far as Grimes 
was concerned — forlorn in name 
only. He was pleased that Rim Jag- 
uar would be making a direct run 
from Mellise to Port Forlorn with no 
time-expending calls en route. All be- 
ing well, he would have a few days 
in which to put things in order prior 
to Sonya’s homecoming. 

It promised to be an uneventful 
voyage — and in Deep Space un- 
eventful voyages are the rule rather 
than the exception. Rim Jaguar was 
one of the more modern units of Rim 
Runners’ fleet, built for them to mod- 
ified Epsilon Class design. She was 
well found, well manned and reason- 
ably happy. Grimes was the only pas- 
senger, and as Rim Runners’ Astro- 
nautical Superintendent he was given 
the run of the vessel. He did not 
abuse the privilege. He would never 
have dreamed of interfering, and he 
made suggestions only when asked to 
do so. Nonetheless, he enjoyed the 
long hours that he spent in the control 
room, yarning with the officers of the 
watch, looking out through the wide 
viewports at the great, distant Galac- 
tic Lens, unperturbed by its weird, 
apparent distortion — the resultant 
of the warped Space-Time through 
which the ship was falling. He was 
Earth-born but, like so many space- 
men who had made their various 
ways to this frontier of the dark, he 
belonged on the Rim, had come to 
accept that almost empty sky — the 
sparsely scattered, unreachable island 
universes, the Galaxy itself no more 
than a dim-glowing ellipsoid — as 
being altogether right and proper and 
somehow far more natural than the 



claustrophobia-inducing crowded fir- 
maments of the worlds toward the 
Center. 

He was sitting in Rim Jaguafs con- 
trol room now, at ease in his accelera- 
tion chair, his seamed, pitted face and 
his still youthful gray eyes almost ob- 
scured by the cloud of acrid smoke 
from his vile, battered pipe. He was 
listening tolerantly to the Third Offi- 
cer’s long list of grievances; shortly 
after departure from Melisse he had 
made it quite plain that he wouldn’t 
bite and also that anything told i6 
him by the ship’s people would not 
be taken down and used as evidence 
against them. 

“And Annual Leave, sir,” the 
young man was saying. “I realize that 
it isn’t always possible to release an 
officer on the exact due date, but 
when there’s a delay of two, or even 
three months . 

“We just haven’t enough person- 
nel, Mr. Sanderson,” Grimes told 
him, “to ensure a prompt relief. Also, 
when it comes to appointments I try 
to avoid putting square pegs into 
round holes. You know what that 
can lead to.” 

“The Rim Griffon business, sir?” 

“Yes. Everybody hating everybody, 
and the ship suffering in consequence. 
A very sorry affair.” 

“I see you point, sir, but . An 
alarm pinged sharply. “Excuse me.” 

I t was the Mass Proximity Indicator 
that had sounded off, the only 
piece of navigational equipment, 
apart from the Carlotti Direction 
Finder, that was functional while the 
Interstellar Drive was in operation. 
Grimes swivelled his chair so that he 



52 



IP 




could look at the globular tank that 
was the screen of the device. Yes, 
there was something there all right, 
something that had no business being 
there, something that, in the screen, 
was only a little to one side of the 
glowing filament that was the extra- 
polation of the ship’s trajectory. 

Sanderson was speal^g briskly 
into the telephone. “Control Room 
here, sir. Unidentified object 00001.5, 
range 3,000, closing. Bearing open- 
ing.” 

Grimes heard Captain Draken- 
berg’s reply. “I’ll be right up, Mr. 
Sanderson.” 

Drakenberg was an untidy bear of 
a man. He looked into the screen and 
grunted, then turned to Grimes. “And 
what do you make of it, sir?” 

“It’s something . 

“I could have told you that. Com- 
modore.” 

Grimes felt his prominent ears red- 
den. Drakenberg was a highly com- 
petent shipmaster, popular rather than 
otherwise with his officers, but at 
times lacking in the social graces. He 
said mildly, “According to Traffic 
Control there are no ships in this sec- 
tor . .” 

“Would it be a Rim Ghost?” asked 
the Captain. “You’re something of 
an expert on them, Commodore. 
Would one show up on the M.P.I.?” 

“Conditions would have to be ex- 
actly right,” said Grimes. “We should 
have had to slip into its continuum, 
or it into ours. The same applies, of 
course, to any attempt to establish 
radio communication . 

“We’ll try that, sir,” said Draken- 
berg bluntly. Then, to Sanderson: 
“Line up the Carlotti.” 



The watch officer switched on the 
control room Carlotti Communicator, 
a miniature version of the main set 
in the ship’s Radio Office which itself 
was a miniature version of the huge, 
planet-based beacons. The elliptical 
Mobius Strip that was the antenna 
began to rotate about its long axis, 
fading into apparent insubstantiality 
as it did so. 

Then Sanderson threw the switch 
that hooked it up with the Mass 
Proximity Indicator. At once the an- 
tenna began to swing on its universal 
mounting, turning hesitantly in a 
wide arc. After its major oscilla- 
tions had ceased, it hunted for a few 
seconds, finally locked on. 

“Pass me the microphone,” Drak- 
enberg ordered. Then he said, speak- 
ing slowly and very distinctly, “R/m 
Jaguar calling unidentified vessel. 
Rim Jaguar calling unidentified ves- 
sel. Come in, please. Come in, 
please.” 

There was a silence, broken by 
Grimes. “Perhaps she hasn’t got 
M.P.I.,” he suggested. “Perhaps she 
hasn’t seen us.” 

“It’s a compulsory fitting, isn’t it?” 
growled the Master. 

“For the Federation’s ships. And 
for ours. But the Empire of Waver- 
ley hasn’t made it compulsory yet. Or 
our Shakespearian Sector neighbors 
either ...” 

He got out of his chair, moved 
to the screen. “Besides, I don’t think 
that this target is a ship. Not with a 
blip that size, and at this range . .” 

“What the hell else can it be?” de- 
manded Drakenberg. 

“I don’t know,” admitted Grimes. 
“I don’t know.” 



LAST DREAMER 



53 




I t hung there against the unrelieved 
blackness of Rim Space, a planet 
where no planet should have been, 
illuminated by a sun that wasn’t there 
at all. There was an atmosphere, with 
cloud masses. There were seas and 
continents. There were polar icecaps. 
But it was real, solid, with enough 
mass to hold the ship — her Inertial 
Drive and her Mannschenn Drive 
shut down — in a stable orbit about 
itself. An Earth-type world it was, 
according to Rim Jaguar*s instru- 
ments — an inhabited world, with the 
scintillant lights of cities clearly vis- 
ible, scattered over its night hemi- 
sphere. 

All attempts at communication had 
failed. The inhabitants did not seem 
to have radio, either for entertain- 
ment or for the transmission of mes- 
sages. Grimes, still in the control 
room, looked with some distaste at 
the useless Carlotti transceiver. Until 
the invention of this device, whereby 
ships could talk with each other and 
with shore stations regardless of range 
and with no time lag, Psionic Radio 
Officers had always been carried. In 
circumstances such as these a trained 
telepath would have been invaluable, 
would have been able to achieve con- 
tact with at least a few minds on the 
planet below. Psionic Radio Officers 
were still carried by fighting ships 
and by survey vessels, but Rim Jaguar 
was neither. She was a merchantman, 
and the employment of personnel re- 
quired for duty only upon very spe- 
cial occasions would have been un- 
economical. 

She did not carry sounding rockets, 
even. Grimes, as Astronautical Super- 
intendent of Rim Runners, had been 



responsible for that piece of economy, 
had succeeded in having the regula- 
tions amended. He had argued that 
ships trading only in a well charted 
section of Space had no need for such 
expensive toys. It had not been anti- 
cipated that an unknown planet — 
matter or anti-matter? — would ap- 
pear suddenly upon the track between 
Mellise and Lorn. 

But the construction of a small 
liquid fuel rocket is little more than 
a matter of plumbing, and the Jag- 
uar*s engineers were able to oblige. 
Her Second Officer — as well as 
being the ship’s navigator, he special- 
ized in gunnery in the Confederacy’s 
Naval Reserve — produced a crude 
but effective homing device for the 
thing. It was hardly necessary. The 
range was short and the target a big 
one. 

The rocket was fired, on such a 
trajectory that it would hit the night 
side while the ship was directly over 
that hemisphere. Radar tracked it 
down to the outer reaches of the 
atmosphere, where it disintegrated. 
But it was a normal, meteoric de- 
struction by impact and friction, not 
the flare of released energy that 
would have told of the meeting of 
matter and anti-matter. That was that. 
The initial reports of the sighting, to- 
gether with all the relevant coordi- 
nates, had already been sent to Lorn; 
all that remained now was to report 
the results of the sounding rocket ex- 
periment. Grimes was scribbling the 
message down on a signals pad, and 
Drakenberg was busy with the pre- 
liminaries to putting the ship back on 
trajectory, when the Radio Officer 
came into the control room. He was 



54 



IF 




carrying three envelopes, one of 
which he handed to the Captain, giv- 
ing the other two to the Commodore. 
Grimes knew what their contents 
would be and sighed audibly. Over 
the years he had become too much 
of an expert on the dimensional oddi- 
ties encountered out on the rim of the 
Galaxy. And he was the man on the 
spot — just when he was in a hurry 
to be getting home. 

The first message was from Rim 
Runners’ Board of Management and 
read, “Act as instructed by Admiral 
commanding Confederate Navy.” 
The second one was from Admiral 
Kravinsky. “Carry out full investiga- 
tion of strange planet.” Drakenberg, 
scowling, handed Grimes the flimsy 
that had been inside his own enve- 
lope. Its content was clear enough. 
“Place self and vessel under orders 
of Commodore Grimes, Rim Worlds 
Naval Reserve.” 

“Keep the ship in orbit. Captain,” 
ordered Grimes resignedly. 

II 

A dust mote in the emptiness, Rim 
Jaguar's No. 2 lifeboat fell to- 
wards the mysterious planet. In it 
were two men only — Grimes and 
Sanderson, the freighter’s Third Of- 
ficer. There had been no shortage of 
volunteers, from the Master on down, 
but Grimes, although a high ranking 
officer of the Naval Reserve, was 
still an employee of a commercial 
shipping line. To make a landing on 
an unknown world with horse, foot 
and artillery was all very well when 
you have the large crew of a warship 
to draw upon; should the initial ex- 



pedition come to grief there would be 
sufficient personnel left aboard the 
vessel to handle her and, if necessary, 
to man her weaponry. But, insofar 
as manning was concerned, a mer- 
chant ship had to be run on a shoe- 
string. There were no expendable rat- 
ings, and the loss of even one officer 
from any department meant at least 
considerable inconvenience. 

Grimes’ decision to take only San- 
derson with him had not been a pop- 
ular one, but the young man had 
been the obvious choice. He was un- 
married and — so Grimes had learn- 
ed from the control room conversa- 
tions — was an orphan. He did not 
have a steady girl friend, even. Fur- 
thermore, he had jiist completed a 
period of Naval Reserve training and 
saw himself as a small arms expert. 

Rim Jaguar, however, did not carry 
much of an armory. Grimes had with 
him his own Minetti and one of the 
ship’s laser handguns. Sanderson had 
one of the other lasers — there were 
only three on board — and a vicious 
10 millimeter projectile pistol. There 
were spare power packs and a good 
supply of ammunition for all weap- 
ons. 

The Third Officer, who was han- 
dling the boat, was talkative on the 
way down. Grimes did not mind — as 
long as the young man kept his trap 
shut and concentrated on his pilotage 
as soon as the little craft hit the 
atmosphere. 

“This is a rum go,” he was saying. 
“How do you explain it, sir? All that 
obvious sunlight — and no sun at all 
in the sky . .” 

“I’ve seen rummer,” Grimes told 
him. “Or as rum . .”

Like, he thought, the series of al- 
ternative universes he had explored — 
although not thoroughly — in that 
voyage of the Faraway Quest that 
somebody had referred to as a Wild 
Ghost Chase. And that other uni- 
verse, into which he had quite literally 
blown his ship, the one in which 
those evil non-human mutants had 
ruled the Rim. On both of those oc- 
casions Sonya had been with him. 
She should have been with him now 
— not this lanky, blond, blue-eyed 
puppy. But that wasn’t Sanderson’s 
fault, and in any case. Grimes did 
not think that he would find the 
young man lacking in any respect. 

“I suppose,” the Third Officer rat- 
tled on, “that it’s all something to do 
with different dimensions. Here, we’re 
at the very edge of the expanding 
Galaxy, and the . the barriers be- 
tween continuums must be stretched 
thin, very thin. That planet’s popped 
through into our continuum, but only 
half through, if you see what I mean. 
Its primary has stayed put on the 
other side of the . boundary . , .” 
“A fairish hypothesis,” admitted 
Grimes. “It will have to do until we 
can think of a better one.” 

A nd, he told himself, there must 
be a better one. So far as he 
knew, the differences between the uni- 
verses were cultural rather than cos- 
mological. There just shouldn’t be a 
planet here — 

“And I wonder what the people are 
like, sir. Would they be humanoid, do 
you think, or even human? TTiey 
must be’ civilized. They have cities.” 
Grimes muttered something about 
plastic jungles. 



“Not plastic, sir. They haven’t ra- 
dio, so the chances are that they don’t 
run to chemical engineering. Concrete 
jungles . Would that be better?” 
Grimes allowed himself to suppose 
that it might be. 

“You couldn’t have timed it better, 
sir. That large town you decided on 
will be just clear of the terminator 
when we get down.” 

In the Federation’s Survey Service, 
thought Grimes, we were drilled so 
that such timing became second na- 
ture. How had that Instructor put it? 
“Make your first landing just west 
of the terminator, and unless some 
bastard chases you off, you’ve the 
whole day to play silly buggers in.” 
“Better fasten seat belts, sir.” 
Grimes pulled the webbing taut 
across his body, snapped shut the 
buckle. In a boat fitted with Inertial 
Drive the ride down to the planetary 
surface should be a smooth one, pro- 
vided that there was no atmospheric 
turbulence. But here there was no 
Spaceport Control to give information 
on meteorological conditions. He 
spoke into the microphone of the 
transceiver. “Commodore to Rim 
Jaguar, We are now entering exo- 
sphere. So far all is going as plan- 
ned.” He heard Drakenberg acknowl- 
edge. 

The air below the boat was clear, 
abnormally so. The lights of the cities 
were like star clusters. For a brief 
second Grimes entertained the crazy 
idea that they were star clusters, that 
he and Sanderson had broken through 
into some other Time and Space, were 
somehow adrift in regions towards 
the heart of a galaxy. He looked up- 
wards for reassurance. But he did not.

through the transparency of the over- 
head viewport, see the familiar, al- 
most empty Rim sky. The firmament 
was ablaze with unfamiliar constella- 
tions. It was frightening. Had San- 
derson somehow turned the boat over 
just as Grimes had shifted his regard? 
He had not, as a glance at the instru- 
ment panel made obvious. He had 
not — and below were still the city 
lights; from zenith to horizon there 
were the stars, and low to the west 
was a great golden moon. Astern, the 
first rosy flush of dawn was in the 
sky. 

His voice unemotional, deliberately 
flat, Grimes reported his observations 
to the ship. 

S wiftly the boat fell through the 
atmosphere, so fast that interior 
temperature rose appreciably. But 
Sanderson was a first-class pilot, and 
at no time did he allow the speed of 
descent to approach dangerous limits. 
Swiftly the boat fell, her Inertial 
Drive purring gently, resisting but not 
overcoming the gravitational field that 
had her in its grip. Through the 
morning twilight she dropped, and 
above her only the brighter stars were 
visible in the pale sky, and below her 
the land masses were gray-green rath- 
er than black, and the city lights had 
lost their sharp scintillance and were 
going out, street by street. 

It was towards what looked like a 
park that Sanderson, on Grimes’ in- 
structions, was steering, an irregular 
rectangle of comparitive darkness out- 
lined by such lights as were still 
burning. There were trees there; the 
men could see them as the boat lost 
altitude; there were trees, and there 



were dull-gleaming ribbons and amoe- 
boid shapes that looked like water, 
and featureless patches that must be 
clear, level ground. Bordering the 
park were the towers of the city — 
tall, fantastically turreted and, when 
struck by the first bright rays of the 
risen sun, shining like jewels in the 
reflected radiance. 

The boat grounded gently on a 
soft, resilient surface. Grimes looked 
at Sanderson, and Sanderson looked 
at Grimes, and then they both stared 
out of the viewports. They had land- 
ed in the middle of the park, on 
what looked like a lawn of emerald 
green grass, not far from the banks 
of a stream. There were trees in the 
foreground — low, static explosions 
of dark foliage among which gleam- 
ed, scarlet and crimson and gold, 
what were either fruit or flowers. In 
the background were the distant tow- 
ers, upthrusting like the suddenly 
frozen spray of some great fountain, 
an opalescent tracery against the clear 
blue sky. 

“Open up, sir?” asked the young 
officer at last. 

“Yes,” said Grimes. Briefly, an 
itemized list of all the precautions that 
should be taken before setting foot 
on a strange planet flashed before his 
mind’s eye, but he ignored it. To 
wear a spacesuit in this huge, gor- 
geous garden would be heresy. But 
not all of his training could be dis- 
missed so easily. Reluctantly he 
picked up the microphone, made his 
report to the ship. He concluded with 
the words, “We’re going out, now, to 
make contact with the natives. You 
have your instructions. Captain.” 

“Yes, Commodore Grimes.”^

Grimes wondered why Drakenberg 
should sound so anxious. “If I don’t 
hear from you again twenty-four 
standard hours from now, at the lat- 
est, I’m to make a report directly to 
the Admiralty and await their or- 
ders.” He hesitated, then brought out 
the final words with some difficulty. 
“And on no account am I to attempt 
another landing.” 

“That is correct, Captain Draken- 
berg. Over.” 

“Good luck, Commodore Grimes. 
Over and out.” 

Sanderson already had both airlock 
doors open, and the cool breeze had 
eddied gently through the little cabin, 
flushing out the acridity of hot oil 
and machinery, bringing with it the 
scent of flowers, of dew-wet grass. 
There were birds singing outside and 
then, faint yet clear, the sound of a 
great clock somewhere in the city 
striking the hour. Automatically 
Grimes looked at his watch, made to 
reset it and then smiled at his fool- 
ishness. He did not know yet what 
sort of time it was that these people 
kept. 

H e was first out of the boat, jump- 
ing down on to the velvety turf, 
joined almost at once by Sanderson. 
“This is a bit of all right!” exclaimed 
the young man. “I hope that the na- 
tives come up to what we’ve seen so 
far.” He added, “The girls especial- 
ly . .” 

Grimes should have reproved him, 
but he didn’t. He was too busy won- 
dering what it was that made every- 
thing so far seem so familiar. He had 
never seen this world before, or any 
planet like it, and yet . How did 



he know, for example, that this city’s 
name was Ayonoree? How could he 
know? 

“Which way do we go, sir?” San- 
derson was asking. 

Which way? The memory, if mem- 
ory it was, wasn’t quite good 
enough. “We’ll follow the stream,” he 
decided. 

It was a short walk to the near 
bank of the little river, along which 
ran a path of flagstones. The water 
was crystal clear, gently flowing. On 
it floated great lily pads, and on one 
of these sat a huge frog, all gold and 
emerald, staring at them with bright, 
protuberant eyes. It croaked loudly. 

“It’s saying something!” cried 
Sanderson. 

“Rubbish!” snapped Grimes, who 
was trying tp break the odd spell that 
had been cast over them. But were 
those words that they could hear? 

^'Follow stream, stay in the dream. 

Follow stream, stay in the dream** 

“You!” shouted Sanderson. “What 
do you mean?” 

In reply the batrachian croaked 
derisively, splashed into the water and 
struck out slowly for the further 
shore. 

So we follow the stream, thought 
Grimes. He set off along the path, 
the young man trailing behind. Sud- 
denly he stopped. There was a tree, 
gracefully trailing its tendril-like 
branches almost to the water, at one 
side of the flagstones, another tree a 
few yards inshore from it. Between 
the trunks was a huge, glittering web. 
There was a spider, too, disgustingly 
hairy, as big in body as a large man’s 
clenched fist, scuttling toward the 
center of its fragile-seeming net. And 



58 



IF 




there was an insect of some kind, a 
confused fluttering of gauzy wings, 
snared by the viscous strands. 

Grimes made to detour around the 
landward tree. After all, spiders were 
entitled to a meal, just as he was. 
Insofar as the uglier sides of Nature 
were concerned, he tried to maintain 
his neutrality. He did not especially 
like spiders — but, in all probability, 
that oversized insect in the web was 
something even nK>re unpleasant. 

Behind him he heard Sanderson 
cry out, heard the hiss of his laser 
pistol and felt the heat of the beam 
that narrowly missed his right ear. 
The fleshy body of the spider ex- 
ploded and hung there, tattered and 
steaming. There was a sickening 
stench of burned flesh. 

Grimes turned angrily on the young 
man. “What the hell do you think 
you’re doing? For all we know, spi- 
ders are sacred on this world . .” 
“More likely these are!” 

Sanderson had pushed past Grimes 
and, with gentle hands, was freeing 
the trapped creature. “Look!” he was 
saying. “Look!” 

T he Commodore looked. This was 
not, as be had assumed, an in- 
sect. It was humanoid, a winged 
woman, but tiny, tiny. Her lustrous 
golden hair hung to her waist, and 
beneath her filmy green robe was the 
hint of perfectly formed breasts. Her 
mouth was scarkt and her eyes blue, 
and her features were perfectly — 
too perfectly? — formed. She sat 
there in the Third Officer’s cupped 
hands, looking up at him. Her voice, 
when she spoke, was like the tinkling 
of a little silver bell. 



** Follow stream, and follow river. 
When danger threatens do not 
quiver; 

Follow stream to Ogre's Keep, 
Wake the Princess from her sleep!'* 
“What Princess?” demanded Grim- 
es. 

She turned to glare at him. 
‘'Prince's servitors, like you. 

Should only speak when spoken 
to," 

Sanderson was shocked. “This is 
the Commodore,” he said severely to 
the winged being. 

“Commodore, Schmommodore!” 
she replied sweetly — and then, with 
hardly a quiver of those impractical 
looking pinions, was gone. 

“So you’re promoted,” said Grimes 
drily. “And I’m demoted.” 

“All the same, sir, it was absolute 
sauce on her part.” Then he went on 
a little smugly. “The odd part is that 
\ am 2i prince. My father was King 
of Tavistock, until they threw him 
out.” 

“And your great grandfather,” said 
Grimes, “who founded the dynasty, 
was a semi-piratical tramp skipper. I 
know the history.” 

“Do we follow the stream, sir?” 
“Yes. It’s as good a way to explore 
this world as any.” 

Ill 

T hey followed the stream. Through 
the great park it led them, past 
enormous beds of fantastic, glowing 
flowers, through a grove of gaunt, 
contorted trees. The transition from 
parkland to city street was abrupt; 
suddenly there were cobbles under- 
foot instead of the worn flagstones.

and on every hand towered the multi- 
colored buildings, the convoluted 
structures that made nonsense of all 
the laws of architecture and engineer- 
ing. 

People were abroad now, men and 
women, a great number of children. 
They were human enough in outward 
appearance at least, but there was an 
oddness about them, an oversimplifi- 
cation of all features, a peculiar blend 
of stylization and caricature. There 
was no vehicular traffic, but there 
were riders — some upon horses, 
some upon camels, some upon the 
lizardlike roadrunners indigenous to 
Tarizeel, some upon beasts that were 
utterly strange even to the widely 
travelled Grimes. 

The two explorers marched on, ig- 
nored by the brightly dressed natives, 
ignoring them. They should. Grimes 
knew, have tried to make contact, 
which would not have been ,hard. 
From the scraps of conversation they 
overheard, it was obvious that Anglo- 
Terran was the language of this plan- 
et. They should have demanded to be 
taken to the king, president or what- 
ever authority it was that ruled this 
world. But it was not important. 
What was important was to find the 
Ogre’s Keep, to awaken the sleeping 
Princess. It was as though some out- 
side power had taken control of them. 
The feeling should have been night- 
marish, but it was not. Grimes was 
oddly grateful that somebody — or 
something — else was making the de- 
cisions that he should have been 
making. 

The stream joined a river, and the 
path continued along the bank of the 
larger body of water, taking the two 



men clear of the city. They walked 
on steadily, feeling no fatigue, main- 
taining a brisk pace. They were away 
from the crowds of the city; they met 
only an occasional pedestrian, and 
now and again a peasant man or 
woman pushing a barrow high-laden 
with produce in to market. One of 
these latter, a wizened, black clad 
crone dragging a little cart overladen 
with pumpkins, accosted them. Rais- 
ing high a skinny claw she declaimed 
in a cracked voice: 

**Dare the dragon! Storm the Keep! 

Save us all from endless sleepP* 

‘The dragon, madam?” inquired 
Grimes politely. 

But she was given no time to an- 
swer him. From the cloudless sky 
crackled a bolt of lightning, dazzling, 
terrifying, striking the path between 
her and the two men. She wailed, “I 
didn’t say anything! I didn’t say any- 
thing!” and was gone, scuttling to- 
wards the city, the cart bouncing 
along behind her, a trail of bruised 
and burst pumpkins in her wake. 

“Somebody Up There doesn’t like 
her,” remarked Sanderson. Then, 
brightly, “Do you feel in the mood 
for dragon-slaying, sir?” 

“Why not?” countered Grimes. Af- 
ter all, it would be no more outra- 
geous than any of their other encoun- 
ters to date. Outrageous? He repeated 
the word mentally. Where had he got 
it from? Nothing, so far, justified its 
use — the frog, the fairy in the spi- 
der’s web, all the talk of Ogre’s Keeps 
and Sleeping Princesses and dragons, 
it had all been perfectly natural. In 
any well regulated world Sleeping 
Princesses were there to be awakened, 
and Ogre’s Keeps to be stormed, and

dragons to be slain. Of course, the 
way that he and the young Prince 
were dressed was all wrong — more 
like peasants than like knights errant. 
But that could not be helped. Dis- 
guise was allowable. 

“Shall we press on, Your High- 
ness?” he suggested. 

“Yes, Sir John. No doubt the drag- 
on awaits us eagerly.” Sanderson pull- 
ed the projectile pistol from its hol- 
ster, spun it carelessly with his right 
forefinger through the trigger guard. 
“Methinks that our magic weapons 
will prove more efficacious than 
swords.” 

“Mehopes that you’re right, Your 
Highness.” 

“Then come. Sir John. Time’s a- 
wasting.” 

T hey walked on — and then, just 
ahead of them, Grim.es saw a 
pontoon landing stage on the river. 
There was a ship alongside it, an 
archaic side-wheel paddle steamer, 
smoke issuing from its tall funnel. At 
the shoreward side of the stage was a 
notice board and on it, in big black 
letters on a white ground, the sign: 
RIVER TRIPS TO OGRESS KEEP. 
HALF A FLORIN. VERY CHEAP. 

“Your highness,” said Grimes, 
“let’s take the boat and rest awhile, 
then face the dragon with a smile.” 
“Have you the wherewithal. Sir 
John, to pay the fare agreed upon?” 
“I have a pass. Prince Sanderson. 
And so have you — your trusty gun.” 
Something at the back of the Com- 
modore’s mind winced at the doggerel 
and cried. voicelessly. You* re a space'- 
man, not a character out of a chil- 
dren*s book! Grimes almost ignored 



it, tried to ignore it, but the nagging 
doubt that had been engendered per- 
sisted. 

They marched onto the pontoon, 
their heavily shod feet ringing on the 
planking, their weapons drawn and 
ready. Side by side, but with Sander- 
son slightly in the lead, they tramped 
up the gangway. At the head of it 
stood a man in uniform — and, in- 
congruously, his trappings were those 
of a Purser in the Waverley Royal 
Mail Line. He held out his hand. 
“Good knights, if you would board 
this ship, pay passage money for your 
trip.” 

“Varlet, stand back! The ride is 
free for this, the bold Sir John, and 
me!” 

“And here, as you can plainly see,” 
added Grimes, making a meaningful 
gesture with his Minetti, “is our loud- 
voiced authority.” 

“Sir, it speaks loud enough for 
me,” admitted the Purser, standing to 
one side. As they passed him Grimes 
heard him mutter, “The Royal Mail 
could not be worse. They never made 
me speak in verse.” 

Grimes, who was always at hon^e 
aboard ships of any kind, led the way 
down to the saloon, a large compart- 
ment, darkly panelled, with black 
leather upholstery on chairs and set- 
tees. At one end of it there was a 
bar, but it was shut. Along both sides 
were big windows, barely clear of the 
surface of the water. There were no 
other passengers. 

Overhead there was the thudding 
of feet on planking. Then there was 
a jangling of bells, followed at once 
by the noise of machinery below 
decks. From above came the long.

mournful note of a steam whistle, 
and then came the steady chunk, 
chunk, chunk of the paddles. 'Hie 
ship was under way, heading down 
river. On either side the banks were 
sliding past, a shifting panorama of 
forest and village, with only rarely 
what looked like a cultivated field, 
but very often a huge, frowning, bat- 
tlemented castle. 

The rhythm of paddles and engines 
was a soothing one and Grimes, at 
least, found that it made him drowsy. 
He lolled back in his deep chair, half 
way between consciousness and sleep 
— and when he was in this state his 
real memories, his very real doubts 
and worries, came suddenly to the 
surface of his mind. He heard his 
companion murmur, “Speed, bonny 
boat, like a bird through the sky. 
Carry us where the dragon must die.” 

“Come off it, Sanderson,” ordered 
the Commodore sharply. 

“Sir John, please take yourself in 
hand. Such insolence I will not 
stand.” 

“Come off it!” ordered Grimes 
again — and then the spell, that had 
been so briefly broken, took charge 
again. “Your Highness, I spoke out 
of turn. But courtesy I’ll try to 
learn.” 

“My Good Sir John, you better 
had. Bad manners always make me 
mad. But look through yonder port, 
my friend. Methinks we near our 
journey’s end.” 

J ourney’s end or not, there was a 
landing stage there towards 
which the paddle steamer was stand- 
ing in. Inshore from it, the land was 
thickly wooded and rose steeply. On 



the crest of the hill glowered the 
castle, a grim pile of gray stone, 
square-built, ugly, with a turret at 
each corner. There was a tall staff 
from which floated a flag. Even from 
this distance the two men could make 
out the emblem — a white skull-and- 
crossbones on a black ground. And 
then, as the ship neared the shore, the 
view was shut out and, finally, only 
the slime-covered side of the pontoon 
could be seen through \he window. 

The paddle steamer came alongside 
with a gentle crunch, and the engines 
were briefly reversed to take the way 
off her. From forward and aft there 
was a quick rattle of steam winches 
as she was moored, and then there 
were no more mechanical noises. 

The Purser appeared in the saloon 
entrance. “Good knights, you now 
must leave this wagon. So fare you 
forth to face the dragon.” 

“And you will wait till we are 
done?” asked Grimes.

Come rain, come shine, come wind, 
come snow. 

Back and forth our ferries go.

“Enough, Sir John,” said Sander^ 
son, “this wordy wight will keep us 
gabbing here all night. I’ truth, he 
tells a pretty tale — this lackey from 
the Royal Mail!” 

The spell was broken again. “You 
noticed too!” exclaimed Grimes. 

“Yes. I noticed. That cap badge 
with a crown over the silver rocket.” 
Sanderson laughed. “It was when I

tried to find a rhyme for “tale” that 
things sort of clicked into place . 

Grimes turned on the Purser. 
“What the hell’s going on here?” he 
demanded. 

“Alas, sir knight, I cannot say. I 
cannot say?** The young man’s pudgy 
face stiffened with resolution. **NoF* 
Come what may . .” 

Whatever it was that came, it was 
sudden. He was standing there, strug- 
gling to speak, and then he was . 
gone, vanished in a gentle thunder- 
clap as the air rushed in to fill the 
vacuum where he had stood. Then 
another man stamped into the saloon, 
in Captain’s uniform with the same 
familiar trappings. 

“Begone, good knights,” he shout- 
ed, “to meet your fate! Get off my 
ship. I’m running late.” 

“Sir,” began Grimes — and then 
that influence gripped his mind again. 
He said, “Thank you for passage, sir. 
Goodbye. We fare forth now, to do 
or die!” 

“Well said, Sir John,” declaimed 
Sanderson. “Well said, my friend. We 
go — to shape the story’s end.” 

“I hope, good knights, you gallant 
two,” growled the Captain, “that 
story’s end does not shape you.” He 
led the way from the saloon up to the 
gangway.

T hey stood on the pontoon, watch- 
ing the little steamer round the 
first bend on her voyage up river, 
then walked to the bridge that span- 
ned the gap between landing stage 
and bank. Overhead the sky was 
darkening and the air was chill. The 



westering sun had vanished behind a 
bank of low clouds. Grimes, his shirt 
and slacks suddenly inadequate, shiv- 
ered. What am I doing here? he asked 
himself. And then, quite suddenly. 
Who am I? It was a silly questian, 
and he at once knew how foolish it 
was. The answer shaped itself ha his 
mind. I am he they call Sir John, true 
comrade to Prince Sanderson. 

“We forward march,” announced 
the Prince, “my cobber bold, to naeet 
the perils long foretold. Up yonder 
hill we climb, and there we’ll beard 
the dragon in his lair.” 

“The dragon wastes no time M 
fuss,” remarked Grimes. “He’s com- 
ing down and bearding us.” 

Yes, the beast was coming down, 
either from the castle or from some- 
where else a-top the hill. It was air- 
borne — and even in his bemused 
state Grimes realized that it should 
never have gotten off the ground. Its 
head and body were too large, its 
wings to small, too skimpy. But it 
was a terrifying sight, a monstrous, 
batwinged crocodile, its mouth agape 
and crowded with jagged teeth, the 
long sharp claws of its forefeet ex- 
tended. It dived down on them, roar- 
ing, ignoring the laser beams that the 
two men directed at it, even though 
its metallic scales glowed cherry red 
where they scored hits. It dived down 
on them — and there was more than 
mere sound issuing from that horrid 
maw. The great gout of smoky flanae 
was real enough, and Grimes and 
Sanderson escaped it only by diving 
into the undergrowth on either side 
of the steep path. 

The beast pulled out of its dive and 
flapped away slowly, regaining alti-

tude. The men watched it until it was 
only a darker speck in the dark sky, 
then realized that the speck was rap- 
idly increasing in size. It was coming 
for them again. 

Something was wrong, very wrong. 
In the fairy tales the dragons never 
kill the heroes — but this dragon 
looked like the exception to prove the 
rule. Grimes bolstered his laser pistol, 
pulled out his Minetti. He doubted 
that the little weapon would be any 
avail against the armored monstrosity, 
but it might be worth trying. From 
the corner of his eye he saw that 
Sanderson had out and ready his own 
heavy, projectile pistol. “Courage, 
Sir John,” called the young man. 
“Aim for his head. We’ve no cold 
steel — we’ll try hot lead!” 

“Cold steel, forsooth!” swore 
Grimes. “Hot lead, indeed! A silver 
bullet’s what we need.” 

“Stand firm. Sir John, and don’t 
talk rot! Don’t whine for what we 
haven’t got!” 

Grimes loosed off a clip at the div- 
ing dragon on full automatic. Sander- 
son, the magazine of whose pistol 
held only ten rounds, fired in a more 
leisurely manner. Both men tried to 
put their shots into the open mouth, 
the most obviously vulnerable target. 
Whether or not they succeeded they 
never knew. Again they had to tumble 
hastily off the path just as the jet of 
flame roared out at them. This time 
it narrowly missed Grimes’ face. It 
was like being shaved with a blow- 
torch. 

G rimes got groggily to his feet, 
fumbled another clip of cart- 
ridges out of the pouch at his belt 



and reloaded the little automatic. He 
saw that Sanderson was pushing a 
fresh magazine into the butt of his 
heavy pistol. The young man smiled 
grimly and said, “Sir John, the am- 
mo’s running low. When all is spent, 
what shall we do?” 

“The beast will get us if we run. 
Would that we’d friends to call 
upon!” 

“Many did give us good advice. If 
they gave us more it would be nice.” 

“What of the fairy Lynnimame?” 

“And how, Sir John, do you know 
her name?” 

The dragon was coming in again, 
barely visible in the fast gathering 
dusk. The men held their fire until 
the last possible moment — and it 
was almost the last moment for both 
of them. Barely did they scramble 
clear of the roaring, stinking flame, 
and as they rolled in the brush both 
of them wer^ frantically beating out 
their smouldering clothing. The wing- 
ed monster, as before, seemed to be 
uninjured. 

Suddenly Sanderson cried out, 
swung to turn his just reloaded pistol 
on a new menace. It was Grimes who 
stopped him, who knocked his arm 
down before he could fire. In the 
glowing ovoid of light was a tiny hu- 
man figure, female, with gauzy wings. 
She hung there over the rough, stony 
path. She was smiling sweetly, and 
her voice, when^ she spoke, was a 
silvery tintinabulation. “Prince, your 
companion called my name. I am the 
fairy Lynnimame. I am she who, this 
very morn, from the jaws of the spi- 
der foul was torn. I pay my debts; 
you rescued me. I’ll rescue you, if 
that’s your fee.”

“Too right it is, you lovesome 
sprite . 

“Then take this, Prince. And now, 
good night.” 

She put something into Sanderson’s 
hand and vanished. Before she flick- 
ered into invisibility Grimes, by the 
pale luminosity of her, saw what it 
was. It was a cartridge case, ordinary 
enough in appearance except that the 
tip of the bullet looked too bright to 
be lead. “A silver bullet!” marvelled 
the young man. “A silver bullet. We 
are saved. He’ll play Goliath to my 
David!” 

“Unless you load, you pious prig, 
he’ll play the chef to your long pig!” 

Hastily Sanderson pulled the maga- 
zine from the butt of his pistol, eject- 
ed the first cartridge, replaced it with 
the silver bullet. He shoved the clip 
back home with a loud click. He was 
just in time; the dragon was upon 
them again, dropping almost vertical- 
ly. The first lurid flames were gush- 
ing from its gaping mouth when the 
Third Officer fired. The result was 
spectacular. The thing exploded in 
mid-air, and the force of the, blast 
sent Grimes tumbling head over heels 
into the bushes, with only a confused 
impression of a great, scarlet flower 
incontinently burgeoning against tfjp 
night. 

He recovered consciousness slowly. 
As before, when he had dozed briefly 
aboard the river steamer, he was 
aware of his identity, knew what he 
was supposed to be doing. And then 
Sanderson’s words severed the link 
with reality, recast the spell. 

“Arise, Sir John! No time for 
sleep! We march against the Ogre’s 
Keep!” 



T hey marched against the Ogre’s 
Keep — but it was an undigni- 
fied scramble up the steep path rather 
than a march. Luckily the moon was 
up now, somewhere above the ever- 
cast, and its diffused light was helj^ 
ful, showing them the dark mass e-f 
briars that barred their way befere 
they blundered into the thenay 
growth. They had not lost their weap- 
ons, and with their laser pistols they 
slashed, and slashed again, and slash- 
ed until their wrists ached with fati- 
gue and their thumbs were numb 
from the continual pressure on the 
firing studs. For a long while they 
made no headway at all; it seemed 
that the severed, spiny tendrils were 
growing back faster than they were 
being destroyed. When the pewer 
packs in the pistols were exhausted 
they were actually forced back a few 
feet while they were reloading. It was 
Grimes who thought of renewing the 
attack with a wide setting instead %t 
the needle beams that they had been 
using at first. The prickly bushes 
went up with a great whoosh «f 
smoky flame, and the two men 
scrambled rather than ran through the 
gap thus cleared — and even then the 
barbed thorns were clutching at them. 

Then, with the fire behind them, 
they climbed on — bruised, tom and 
weary. They climbed, because it was 
the only thing to do. At last they 
were high enough up the hillside to 
see the castle again, black and for-? 
bidding against the gray sky. The few 
squares of yellow light that were win- 
dows accentuated rather than relieved 
the darkness.

They gained the rock-strewn pla- 
teau in the center of which towered 
the Keep. They stumbled across the 
uneven surface, making their way 
between the huge boulders, avoiding 
somehow the fissures that made of 
the ground a crazy pattern of cracks. 
From some of these sounded ominous 
hissings and croakings and gruntings; 
from some there was a baleful gleam- 
ing of red eyes; but nothing actively 
molested them. And there was a ris- 
ing wind now, damp and cold, that 
made a mockery of their rent, in- 
adequate clothing and that whined 
and muttered in their ears like un- 
quiet ghosts. 

But they kept on — a staggering, 
faltering pace — and came at last to 
the great, iron-studded doorway. 
Barely within Sanderson’s reach — 
and he was a tall man — was a huge 



knocker, forged in the semblance of a 
snarling lion’s head. The yoimg of- 
ficer had to stretch to reach it. As he 
put his hand to it, it moved of its 
own accord, emitting a thunderous 
clangour like an artillery barrage. 

Boom, boom! Boom, boom! Boom! 

Almost as loud were the heavy 
footsteps that sounded thunderously 
behind the door. Almost as loud was 
the deep voice that asked, “Who on 
this night so bleak and frore, disturbs 
the Giant Blunderbore?” ^ 

T he double valves of the door 
crashed outwards. Standing there, 
silhouetted against the light, was a 
human figure. It was all of ten feet 
tall, and broad in proportion. It look- 
ed down at them, its eyes gleaming 
yellow in the black face, and bellow- 
ed, “Enter, princeling! Enter, knight! 





Ye shall be my guests tonight.” Then, 
as the two men drew back, it went 
on, “Come in, come ini This is Lib- 
erty Hall — you can spit on the mat 
and call the cat a bastard!” 

The lapse from rh5mied couplets 
and the use of an expression that had 
never failed to annoy him snapped 
Grimes back to reality. He was Com- 
modore John Grimes, of the Rim 
Worlds Naval Reserve, not Sir John, 
and he was supposed to be investigat- 
ing this crazy planet But the castle 
was real enough, as was the giant 
who loomed there in the open door- 
way — as were the bruises on his 
body that still ached, the scratches 
and burns that still smarted. 

“What’s the matter?” he asked nas- 
tily. “Can’t you find a rhyme for 
‘b^tard*? And who are you, any- 
how?” 

“And who are you? All I know is 
that you are outsiders, and I’m sup- 
posed to stop you. Not that I want 
to. This damn foolishness has gone 
on too Img. Much too long . 

From the sky thundered a great 
voice, ‘^lunderbcH’e, your duty’s 
plain! These prying strangers mu^ 
be slain!” 

The giant stared upwards, growl- 
ed, “Nirts to you. Fve had you, chum, 
in a big way.” 

The answer was a sizzHng bolt of 
ligh tning , a crackling streak of daz- 
zling energy that should have incin- 
erated Blunderbore where he stood. 
But he caught it with a huge hand, 
laughed and hurled it back like a 
flaming javelin, shouting, ‘Try that 
on for size, damn you!” 

“What*s going on?” Sanderson 
whimpered. “What’s going on here?” 



“It’s a long story ...” Blunder- 
bore told him. 

“It’s a story all right,” agreed 
Grimes. “The city of Ayonoree . 
The Frog Prince . The Fairy 
Lynnimame . And you. Blunder- 
bore . .” Yes, it was all coming 
back to him, and it was all making a 
fantastic kind of sense. 

“Can you be killed?” Blunderbore 
was asking. 

“I suppose so,” said Grimes, con- 
scious of the smart of his wounds. 
“Yes, I fear so. We’re the outsiders. 
We don’t belong in the series, do we? 
And you and the others go on from 
installment to installment . .” 

“Only because we’re trapped. But 
come in. You have to wake the Prin- 
cess. It’s the only way out, for all of 
us.” 

T he huge man stood to one side as 
Grimes and Sanderson hurried 
into the castle. They were barely in 
time, were almost knocked from their 
feet by the wind from the crashing 
volley of great rocks that fell from 
the black sky. I^>linters stung the 
backs of their legs painfully. Grunt- 
ing, Blunderbore pushed past them, 
seized the two valves of the door in 
his big hands, pulled them shut just 
as another shower of boulders crash- 
ed against the stout, iron-bound tim- 
bers. “Hurry!” he shouted. “He’s 
turning nasty!” 

The giant led the way across the 
flagstoned floor, to the far end of the 
enormous, gloomy hall. He staggered 
as he ran — and with cause. The 
very earth was growling beneath their 
feet, and each successive tremor was 
more violent than the last. From 



68 



IF 




above came a crash of toppling ma- 
sonry. 

The air was thickening. Tendrils of 
yellow fog clutched at the running, 
stumbling men, and the writhing mist 
had substance. Half-seen, evil faces 
leered at them, distorted visages that 
were all teeth and dull-gleaming eyes. 
Vaporous claws reached out for them, 
solidifying as they did so. Behind 
Grimes Sanderson screamed, and the 
Commodore stopped and turned, 
slashing with his laser at the gelatin- 
ous obscenity that had the young of- 
ficer in its grip. It piped shrilly as it 
disintegrated, stinking sulphurously. 

“Hurry!” B1 underbore was still 
shouting. “Hurry!” 

The stone floor was cracking un- 
derfoot, heaving and buckling, and 
from the high, vaulted ceiling omin- 
ous groans resounded. The castle 
could not withstand this punishment 
for long. The flaring torches were 
going out, and there was a strong 
smell of escaping gas — and then, as 
a chance spark ignited the explosive 
mixture, there was a fiery blast that 
almost finished the destructive work 
initiated by the earthquake. 

Almost finished . 

But Blunderbore and the two 
spacemen were still on their feet, 
somehow, and there were still walls 
around them, although crumbling 
and tottering; and over their heads 
the last stone arch still held, despite 
the torrential rain of rubble that was 
clattering upon and around it. Ahead 
of them was the great fireplace into 
which the giant jumped without 
stooping. Then he bent slowly and 
fumbled among the dead ashes. He 
straightened even more slowly, the 



muscles of his naked back and arms 
bulging and glistening. He grunted as 
he came erect, holding before him an 
enormous slab of stone. He cast it 
from him — and' the noise of its fall 
and its shattering was lost amid the 
general uproar. 

Under the slab was a spiral stair- 
way, a helix of rusty iron running 
down and down, down to murky 
depths where flickered an eerie blue 
glimmer. The prospect was not an in- 
viting one; how long would the walls 
of the shaft withstand the incessant 
tremors? 

Even so, the great fire was yet to 
come, whereas the frying pan was 
becoming hotter and hotter. Great 
sheets of flame from the ruptured gas 
mains were shrieking across the ruin- 
ed hall, and through them crashed 
increasingly heavy falls of debris. 
And the writhing phantasms were 
back, multiplying in spite of the gey- 
sers of burning, exploding gas, co- 
alescing, solidifying, piping and tit- 
tering. They were insubstantial no 
longer, their claws and their teeth 
were sharp. 

“Down with you!” bellowed Blun- 
derbore. “Down with you! It’s the 
only way!” 

“You lead!” gasped Grimes, using 
his laser like a sword, slashing at the 
half-materialized things that were 
closing in upon. them. 

“No . ril hold . them off 
. .” The giant had wrenched the 
great iron spit from its sockets on 
either side of the fireplace, was flail- 
ing away with it, grunting with every 
stroke. Tattered rags of ectoplasm 
clung to its ends, eddied thrqpgh the 
smoke and dust-filled air.

G rimes paused briefly at the head 
of the spiral staircase, then 
barked to Sanderson, “Come on!” He 
clattered down the shaking treads, his 
left hand on the outer guard rail, his 
pistol clenched in his right fist. The 
central column seemed to be trying 
to tie itself into a knot, but it held, 
although the steps were canting at 
odd angles. The walls of the shaft 
were starting to bulge inwards. 

Grimes ran — down, down, round, 
round — keeping his footing in spite 
of the earthquake shocks, in spite of 
his increasing dizziness. He ran, and 
after him ran the Third Officer. Up 
there above, Blunderbore was still 
fighting; his joyous bellowing came 
rolling down on them like thunder, 
loud even above the clangorous de- 
struction of the Ogre’s Keep. 

Down, down . 

Grinies staggered on, forcing his 
legs to move, to go on moving, taking 
great gasps of the damp, fetid air. 
Something barred his way, something 
long and serpentlike, with absurdly 
small forelegs, with curved poison- 
fangs and a flickering black tongue. 
The Commodore tried to stop, tried 
to bring up his pistol to a firing posi- 
tion, but could not. His impetus car- 
ried him on. Then he was through 
the monster; its body offered no more 
resistance than wet tissue paper. 
Down, down . 

It was more of a fall than a run. 
It was a fall. 

Grimes thudded gently into some- 
thing thick and soft, lay sprawled on 
the soft bed of moss, breathing in 
great, painful gulps. Slowly he be- 
came aware of his surroundings — 
the cave, lit by a soft, rosy radiance 



with no apparent source, the opales- 
cent colonnades of stalactite and sta- 
lagmite, the tinkling, glittering water- 
fall. He focused his attention upon 
his immediate vicinity. The Prince 
was still with him, was himself slow- 
ly stirring into wakefulness. Sir John 
knew where he was. This was the 
Witch’s Cave, the home of the wick- 
ed Melinee. 

She was standing over them, a tall 
woman, white of skin, black of hair, 
vividly red of mouth, clad in a robe 
of misty gray. In either hand she held 
a crystal goblet, bedewed with con- 
densation. She murmured, “Rest you 
awhile, good knights and true, and 
pray accept this cooling brew.” 
Sanderson reached greedily for the 
vessel she held out to him — and 
Grimes, firing from his supine posi- 
tion, exploded it into a spray of 
splinters and acrid steam. 

“It’s not the mess,” protested San- 
derson, “but it’s the waste! I never 
even got a taste!” 

“Prince, had we quaffed the 
witch’s wine,” Grimes told him, “it 
would have turned us into swine . .” 
Melinee laughed, a low, throaty 
gurgle. “You know too much, too 
much by far. But you’ll be more fun 
the way you are.” She looked at 
Sanderson as she said this. The invi- 
tation in her black eyes, her parted 
scarlet lips, was unmistakable. 

T he young officer reacted. He got 
gracefully to his feet, took a step 
towards the witch. He said gallantly, 
“Who needs wine when you’re 
around, beautiful?” 

“Careful!” warned Grimes. 

“Have we been careful so far, sir? 

IF 



70 




We’ve been collecting all the kicks 

— it’s time that we got our paws on 
some of the ha’pence.” Then, to the 
woman, “Isn’t there somewhere 
around here a little more private?” 

She smiled. “My bower, behind 
the waterfall . .” 

“Sanderson! I order you to keep 
away from this female!” 

“/ give the orders around here, old 
man,” said Melinee sweetly. “This is 
my cave, and whatever your rank 
may be it means nothing as long as 
you’re on my property.” She turned 
again to Sanderson. The filmy robe 
was already slipping down from one 
smooth shoulder, and it was obvious 
that she was wearing nothing under- 
neath it. “Come,” she murmured. 

The admonitory voice boomed 
from the roof of the cavern. “Meli- 
nee, you forget yourself!” 

“I don’t!” she shouted. “I’m re- 
membering myself. I’m a real per- 
son, not a character in some stupid 
children’s fairy story! If you can’t 
write adult fiction, buster, Vm taking 
charge of the plot. I’m supposed to 
be stopping these men from going 
any further, aren’t I? Then shut up 

— and let me do it my way!” 
“Melinee!” 

“That’s not my name, and you 
know it.” She turned again to San- 
derson. “Don’t be shy, spaceman. I’ll 
show you just how wicked a wicked 
witch can be!” 

“Mr. Sanderson!” Grimes’ voicQ 
crackled with authority, “Leave that 
woman alone!” 

The young man stood there, ob- 
viously thinking mutinous thoughts 
but not daring to express them. The 
woman stood there, looking at him, a 



contemptuous little smile curving her 
full lips. And then she turned, began 
to walk slowly and gracefully to- 
wards the waterfall. Her robe was al- 
most transparent. 

“Melinee!” The voice from the 
roof expressed entreaty as well as 
anger. 

And why, Grimes asked himself 
suddenly, should I be on his side? He 
said aloud, but quietly, “All rightf 
Mr. Sanderson. Go with her.” 

Sanderson shook his head bewild- 
eredly. “First of all you tell me not 
to, and now you say that I can . • . 
After all, we are on duty . .” 

“Go with her,” repeated Grimes. 
It was more of an order than a sug- 
gestion. 

“But, sir . .” 

“Damn it all, when I was your age 
I didn’t have to be told twice.” 

The Wicked Witch called over her 
shoulder, “Do as the nice man says, 
darling.” 

The Third Officer made a sort of 
growling noise deep in his throat, 
glared defiantly at the Commodore, 
then started after the woman. She 
had reached the shimmering curtain 
of the waterfall, was passing through 
it. As she turned to look back 
through the rippling transparency 
Sanderson quickened his pace. Grimes 
chuckled, pulled from his pocket the 
battered pipe that somehow had sur- 
vived unbroken, filled it, then osten- 
tatiously used his laser pistol as a 
lighter. It was a dangerous trick, but 
an impressive one. 

From beyond the cascade came the 
sound of a crooning female voice. 
“Mirror, mirror on the wall . 
Who is the fairest one of all?” Then

there was a crash of splintering glass 
and a scream. “No! No! You can’t 
do that to me! I’ll fix you! I’ll fix 
you, you , . fairy story teller]” 
Mdinee burst back into the main 
cavern. She was shaking with mur- 
derous fury. “Look!” she yelled. 
“Look what that bastard did to me!” 
Grimes looked. Sanderson looked. 
“But , . the latter started to say. 
Grimes interjected hastily, “It’s 
shocking!” He was lying — as the 
mirror must have done. 

“Come on!” she snarled. “This 
bloody joke’s gone on quite long 
enough]”

S he led the way into her bower, 
through the curtain of falling 
v/ater. As Grimes passed through it, 
he heard behind him the clatter of 
falling stalactites, felt the brief wave 
of scalding heat as the waterfall 
flashed into steam. But it was too 
late to harm him, and the others 
were well clear. 

On the far wall of the bower was 
the mirror — or what had been the 
mirror. Now it was only an elabo- 
rately molded golden frame set into 
the rock face. Melinee scrambled 
through it, ignoring the sharp shard 
that ripped her robe from hip to 
anlde, Sanderson followed her, then 
Grimes. The tunnel beyond it was 
unpleasantly organic in appearance, 
a convoluted tube, with smooth and 
pinkly glistening walls, winding and 
pulsing underfoot, writhing. 

Melinee ran on, sure-footed. Some- 
where she had lost her sandals, had 
probably used one of them to smash

the lying, libelous looking-glass. The 
men, in their shoes, slipped and 
slithered, but they kept up with her. 
Down they went, and down, losing 
all sense of direction, losing their 
footing, putting hands out to steady 
themselves against smooth, warm 
walls that shrank away from the 
touch. Down they went, and down, 
gasping in the hot air, suddenly con- 
scious that the red-glowing walls were 
steadily contracting. Soon there 
would he no going any further ahead, 
and no turning back. 

They were crouching, and then 
they were slithering on their bellies. 
Grimes, who had passed Sanderson 
while it was still possible, while there 
was still .freedom of mavement, sud- 
denly found his way blocked and 
realized that the crown of his head 
was pressing against the soles of Me- 
linee’s bare feet. Faintly her voice 
came back to him. “We’re there . 
At the airlock . But ... I don’t 
know how to open it . 

“I . .1 have to crawl past you 
. .. .” gasped Grimes. Then, urgently, 
“Make yourself small, woman! 
Breathe out!” 

“I’ll . .try .. .” 

L ike an ^earthworm in its tunnel — 
but with far less agility, far less 
speed — the Commodore edged for- 
ward. Somehow he managed to get 
both arms ahead of his hody, clutch- 
ed filmy fabric and the firm flesh be- 
neath. He heard her give a little 
scream, but he ignored it. Cloth tore, 
and -then he had a firm grip on her 
waist, just above her hips. His face 
was over her heels, and .then pressing 
down on her ankles. Somehow he 



was still able to draw an occasional 
breath. His face was sliding — but 
slowly, slowly — up the valley be- 
tween her calves. He hunched his 
back, and the resilient wall above 
him gave a little. 

He grunted as he wriggled for- 
ward. Somehow he negotiated her 
buttocks, then his fingers were on her 
shoulders. He pulled himself ahead 
more rapidly now. He spat out a 
mouthful of hair, then slid his hands 
along her upreaching bare arms. And 
then there was metal, blessedly hard 
and solid to the touch — and touch 
was the only sense that he had to 
guide him. 

Was this an airlock door? He did 
not know; he had only her word for 
it. And if it were, indeed, an airlock 
door, was it of the standard pattern? 
It had to be, otherwise the situation 
was utterly hopeless. Cramped as he 
was. Grimes could never get his laser 
pistol out of its holster — and if he 
could, its employment in this confin- 
ed space could well prove fatal to 
himself and to the others. 

His fingers groped, scrabbled, feel- 
ing nothing at first hut smooth^ seam- 
less metal. He had almost given up 
hope when he found what he was 
looking for — the neat little hole, 
large enough to admit a spacegloved 
digit. He had to squirm and contort 
himself to get his hand to the right 
angle. Under him Melinee whim- 
pered a little, but did mot complain. 

The tip of his index finger crept 
over the faired rim of the hole^ push- 
ed into it, at first encountering noth- 
ing at all and then, after what seemed 
an eternity, smooth plastic. Grimes 
pushed, felt the surface give. He

maintained the pressure, relaxed it, 
pushed again, and again, making O 
in Morse Code — O for Open. 

He heard the faint whirr of ma- 
chinery — a noise that suddenly 
became louder. The inward-opening 
door almost took his finger with it. 
And then he was in the airlock, 
closely followed by Sanderson. 
Melinee had vanished. 

S lowly Grimes and Sanderson walk- 
ed through the too-silent alley- 
ways of the ship, fighting the lassi- 
tude that threatened to close down 
upon them, forcing their way through 
air that seemed to possess the vis- 
cosity of cold treacle. But they were 
not alone. In their ears — or in their 
minds? — sounded the croaking voice 
of the Frog Prince, the tinkling so- 
prano of the Fairy Lynnimame, the 
husky whisper of Melinee. “You 
must not give in. You have come so 
far; you must not give in. Waken the 
Princess. Waken the Princess.” And 
there was Blunderbore’s urgent mut- 
tering, and the faint voices of the 
River Queen's Captain and Purser. 
“Wake the Princess. Wake the Prin- 
cess.” 

They stumbled on, weakening, 
througji the gelid air, the internal 
atmosphere that didn’t even smell 
right, that didn’t smell at all, that 
lacked the familiar taints of hot oil 
and machinery, of tobacco smoke 
and women’s perfume, the clean, gar- 
den scents of the hydroponics deck. 
They staggered on, through alleyways 
and up companionways, fighting ev- 
ery inch of the way, sustained some- 
how by the fairy-tale characters 
whom they had encountered. 



And Grimes knew what was 
wrong, knew the nature of the stasis 
that must soon make them part of 
itself, thsit would make them part of 
itself unless they reached the Manns- 
chenn Drive room in time. He had 
read of — but had never until now 
experienced — the almost impossible 
balance of forces, the cancelling out 
of opposing temporal precession 
fields that would freeze a ship and all 
her people in an eternal Now, for- 
ever adrift down and between the 
dimensions. That had been one of 
the theories advanced to account for 
the vanishing without trace of that 
Waverley Royal Mail liner ten stan- 
dard years ago — the ship aboard 
which the writer Clay Wilton had 
been a passenger. 

Grimes could remember, vividly, 
the blurb on the dust jacket of the 
book that he had bought as a present 
for the small daughter of a friend. 
“The last of the dreamers,” the au- 
thor had been called. He had skim- 
med through it, had laughed at the 
excellent illustrations and then, to his 
amazement, had been gripped by the 
story. It was about a world that never 
was and never could be, a planet 
where sorcery was everyday practice, 
where talking animals and good fair- 
ies and wicked witches interfered in 
the affairs of men and women. 

You are beginning to understand 
. whispered Lynnimame. 

T here was the door ahead of them, 
with Mannschenn Drive in shin- 
ing metal letters above it. There was 
the door ahead of them, the closed 
door, the stubborn door. It would 
not yield. Human muscles were pow- 



74 



IF 




erless against the stasis; human mus- 
cles with strength flowing into them, 
somehow, from outside were still 
powerless. The handle snapped off 
cleanly in Grimes’ hand. 

“Let me, sir,” Sanderson was say- 
ing. “Let me try.” 

The Commodore stepped slowly to 
one side, his motions those of a deep 
sea diver. He saw that the young man 
had his laser weapon out of its hols- 
ter, was struggling to raise it against 
the dreadful inertia. ^ 

He pressed the firing stud. 

Slowly, fantastically the beam of 
intense light extruded itself from the 
muzzle, creeping towards that im- 
movable door. After an eternity it 
made contact, and after another eter- 
nity the paint began to bubble. Eons 
passed, and there was a crater. More 
eons dragged by — and the crater 
was a hole. StiH Sanderson, his face 
rigid with strain, held the weapon 
steady. Grimes could imagine that 
luminous, purple worm crawling 
across the space from the door to 
the switchboard. Then Sanderson 
gasped, “I can’t keep it up!” and the 
muzzle of the pistol wavered, sagged 
until it was pointing at the deck. 

We tried, thought Grimes. Then 
he wondered. Will Wilton add us to 
his permanent cast of characters? 

Suddenly there was sound again — 
the dying, deepening whine of a stop- 
ped Mannschenn Drive unit, of spin- 
ning, processing gyroscopes slowing 
to final immobility. Like a bullet fir- 
ed from a gun deflected after the 
pulling of the trigger, the laser beam 
had reached its target. There was 
sound again — fans, and pumps, the 
irregular throbbing of the Inertial 



Drive, and all the babble and clam- 
or of a suddenly awakened ship. 
From bulkhead speakers boomed a 
voice, that of the Captain of the river 
steamer. “Whoever you are, come 
up to the main saloon, please. And 
whoever you are — thank you.” 

VII 

G rimes sprawled comfortably in an 
easy chair, a cold drink ready 
to hand. He had decided to stay 
aboard this ship, the Princess of 
Troon, having persuaded her Master 
to set trajectory for Lorn. After all, 
he was already ten years late — a 
few more weeks would make very 
little difference. During the voyage 
the Commodore would be able to 
question the Princesses personnel still 
further, to work on his report. He 
was keeping young Sanderson with 
him. Drakenberg had not been at all 
pleased when deprived of the services 
of a watch officer — but the Com- 
modore piled on far more G’s than 
he did. 

Already Grimes was beginning to 
wonder if his report would be be- 
lieved, in spite of all the corrobora- 
tive evidence from the personnel of 
both ships, Rim Jaguar and Princess 
of Troon. He recalled vividly the 
scene in the passenger liner’s main 
saloon when he and Sanderson had 
made their way into that compart- 
ment. The stasis must have closed 
down while everybody was at dinner; 
dishes on the tables were still steam- 
ing. 

They had all been there — the 
froglike Grollan, the old lady who 
had been the peasant woman en-

countered on the towpath, the pretty, 
fragile blonde whose name should 
have been Lynnimame, but was not 

— all of them looking like the char- 
acters in the illustrations to the Clay 
Wilton books. And there was the big 

— but not all that big — Negro, who 
was a physicist, not an ogre, and the 
Captain, and the Purser. There was 
the beautiful woman who could have 
been the model for the Melinee in the 
pictures and who was, in fact, Mrs. 
Wilton. There were other officers, 
other passengers, and among them 
was Clay Wilton himself. He had 
the beginnings of a black eye, and a 
trickle of blood still dribbled from 
the corner of his mouth. Ship’s staff 
had formed a protective cordon 
about him — making it quite obvious 
that this was only because they had 
been ordered to do so. 

After the first excitement there 
had been the conference, during 
which all concerned tried to work out 
what had happened, and why. Blun- 
dell, the big physicist — it had been 
hard not to think of him as Blunder- 
bore — had said, “I’ve my own ideas. 
Commodore Grimes. But you, sir, are 
the recognized authority on Rim 
phenomena . .” 

G rimes was flattered, and tried not 
to show it. He made a major 
production of filling and lighting his 
pipe. After he had it going he said, 
“I can try to explain. The way I see 
it is this. The ship went into Stasis 
— and somehow drifted out from the 
Waverley sector towards the Rim. 
And out here, at the very edge of the 
expanding Galaxy, there’s always an 
. oddness. Time and Space are 



inclined not to follow the laws that 
obtain elsewhere. Too, Thought 
seems to have more power — physi- 
cal power, I mean — than in the 
regions more towards the Center. It’s 
all part and parcel of the vagueness 
— that’s not quite the right word — 
of ... of everything. We get along 
with it. We’re used to it. 

“Well . Look at it this way. You 
were all of you frozen in your ever- 
lasting Now, but you could still think, 
and you could still dream. And who 
was the most expert dreamer among 
you? It had to be Clay Wilton — 
after all, his publishers refer to him 
as The Last Of The Dreamers. Mr. 
Wilton dreamed out the story that he 
was working on at the time when 
your Mannschenn Drive went on the 
blink. Then he dreamed of the next 
story in the series, and the next, and 
the next . Somehow a world shap- 
ed itself about his dreams. Out here, 
on the Rim, there must be the raw 
material for the creation of new gal- 
axies. Somehow that world shaped 
itself, a solid world, with atmosphere, 
and vegetation, and people. It was 
real enough to register on all Rim 
Jaguar's instruments, even though it 
vanished when this ship came out of 
Stasis. It was real enough — but, with 
a few exceptions, the people weren’t 
real. They were little more than mo- 
bile scenery. The exceptions, »x)f 
course, were those characters drawn 
from real life. And they led a sort 
of double existence. One body here, 
aboard the ship, and another body on 
the surface of that impossible planet, 
dancing like a puppet as Mr. Wilton 
manipulated the strings. But towards 
the end, the puppets got restive . .” 



76 



IF 




“You can say that again, Commo- 
dore,” grinned Blundell. 

“Yes, the puppets were getting res- 
tive and realized that they, too, 
could become puppetmasters, could 
use Mr. Sanderson and myself to 
break the Stasis. And at the same 
time, Mr. Wilton was trying to work 
us into his current plot.” Grimes 
turned to the writer. “Tell me, sir, 
did you intend to kill us?” 

“Nobody dies in my stories,” mut- 
tered the man. “Not even the bad- 
dies.” 

“But there has to be a first time 
for everything. That dragon of yours 
was far too enthusiastic. And so was 
your destruction of the castle.” 

“I’d gotten kind of attached to the 
place, too,” grumbled the physicist. 
“I meant no harm.” Wilton’s voice 



his chair. They were sharing a settee 
only a few feet from him. 

“The really fantastic thing about it 
all, Lynnimame — I like to call you 
that, after all, it was your name when 
I first met you. You don’t mind, do 
you?” Sanderson was saying. 

“Of course not, Henry. If you like 
it, I like it.” 

“Good-oh. But as I was saying, the 
really fantastic thing about it all, the 
way I fitted into old Wilton’s story, 
is that I am 2 i prince . .” 

“But I think,” said Grimes coldly 
as he got up from his chair, “that the 
Wicked Witch will be able to vouch 
that you’re not a fairy prince.” 

And would they all live happily 
ever after? he wondered as he made 
his way to his cabin. He doubted it.

LAST DREAMER 




IF • Short Story 




MERLIN PLANET 



by B. G. VON WALD 



I t was just before noon in the little 
town of Arrey that Jerrold Aix 
beheld the logically impossible event. 

He shut his eyes tightly, shook his 
head, and then looked again. The 
scene had not changed. There was 
the huddle of wary people on one 
side of the small village square. 
There was the tall, hooded man with 
the bushy beard and the piercing 
black eyes. And there was the over- 
sized frog sitting on the pile of ragged 
garments. 

Suddenly frightened, Jerrold took 
a backward step, but he had already 
been observed. The bearded one was 
now looking intently at him, the 



slender stick in his hand raised as if 
to gesture. 

Jerrold abruptly ducked around 
the edge of a squat stone building 
and ran. It was not easy to run on 
those slippery cobblestones, and the 
muddy water of the puddles splashed 
in the village square drove him on. 

It had been a bad day right from 
his carefully-selected native costume, 
but the shock of what had happened 
the beginning. First there was that 
long chess game during the Zipstar 
trip. In a careless moment, he had 
pushed the wrong pawn, and that 
political scientist from Arcturus IV 
took immediate advantage of it. The 



78 




result was a desperate but futile de- 
fense in the inexorable logic of the 
end game. It had been a bitter thing 
for one who had been champ at 
Centaurus Multiversity. 

Then the landing officer of the 
Zipstar boat had insisted on leaving 
him ten kilometers outside Arrey as 
a security measure, so that he had 
to spend the whole morning walking 
in a hot, muggy sun. 

And now this — impossible, illogi- 
cal and terrifying. He almost expect- 
ed to find that they had dropped him 
on the wrong planet, but finally he 
saw the sign at the end of the narrow 
street, right where it was supposed 
to be. This caln>ed him a little. He 
slowed down, hiked his skirts to ford 
a particularly large puddle in front 
of the sign, and entered the rickety, 
wooden building. 

44TTI^ell?” There was a gray-hair- 
▼ ▼ ed man seated behind the 
desk who seemed irritated at the in- 
terruption. 

Jerrold tried to talk, but he was 
out of breath. Instead, he pulled his 
appointment card from a pocket and 
set it on the desk. 

“Um,” said the man after a brief 
glance at it. “Sit down.” 

Jerrold gratefully sank onto the 
crude wooden chair indicated. “Is 
this the right place?” he panted. 

“This is Consolidated Enterprises, 
Endive Planet Division,” said the 
grizzled man. “I am Director Finn. 
And according to your appointment 
card, you are the new operative I’ve 
been trying to get out of Personnel 
for the past six months. What’s the 
matter with you?” 



Jerrold shook his head. “I don’t 
know what happened,” he said un- 
certainly. “But I saw something that 
is absolutely impossible.” His voice 
faltered. 

“Oh-oh,” said Finn. He got up 
quickly and drew a bottle and glass 
from a cupboard and poured Jerrold 
a stiff one. 

“Here, drink this. I gather you 
saw one of the local hot-shots at 
work. What happened?” 

“I don’t know. It was logically im- 
possible. It just couldn’t have hap- 
pened, but I saw it and — ” 

“Drink!” ordered Finn bruskly. 
Jerrold drank, sputtered and gasp- 
ed for breath. After a moment, Finn 
said, “Feel better now?” 

Without replying, Jerrold nodded. 
“Then tell me what you saw.” 
“Oh.” Jerrold drained the last few 
drops from the glass. Then he stated, 
“Like I said, it was impossible. I 
thought I saw a man changed into a 
frog.” He took a deep breath and 
wondered whether his new boss 
would laugh or call for the medics. 

“Frog, eh?” Finn said thoughtful- 
ly. He nodded. “Sounds like one of 
Eilen’s spells. He’s a mean one, all 
right, but shrewd. A pity the sheriff 
can’t pin anything illegal on him.” 

J errold stared at him with dismay- 
ed wonder. “You mean you be- 
lieve it really happened?” 

“Who knows what really happens 
in such events?” Finn asked impa- 
tiently. “That’s all beside the point, 
anyway. Universal Enterprises isn’t 
in the natural philosophy business. 
But if you are going to work on 
Endive, you had better get used to 



MERLIN PUNET 



79 




such things. Didn’t they brief you 
on the place?” 

“Certainly. Planetary specs, com- 
mercial potentials, local languages — ” 

“But no magic?” 

Jerrold shook his head incredu- 
lously. 

“And no counter-magic, then, I 
take it?” 

“Counter-magic!” 

Finn scowled and returned to his 
chair. “Didn’t they even tell you that 
Endive is a merlin planet?” 

“Oh yes.” 

“But you didn’t bother to look up 
the reference.” 

“Oh, but I did look it up,” Jerrold 
protested. “The Catalog said that a 
merlin planet is a generic term for 
certain, very unusual planets which 
have technologically primitive cul- 
tures in which magic plays a strong 
role. They are closed to ordinary 
interstellar commerce, except for spe- 
cial franchises.” 

“Well,” Finn admitted, “It’s 
sketchy, but it’s all there. You just 
didn’t believe it, I guess. You read 
the word ‘magic’ and mentally inter- 
preted it as ‘belief in magic.’ Right?” 

Jerrold drew a breath and started 
to say something to the effect that 
such a conclusion was obvious, but 
then he remembered the over-sized 
frog hopping out of the pile of rag- 
ged clothing. 

“It looks as if I’ll have to brief 
you,” Finn grumbled. “As if I didn’t 
have enough to do already.” 

H e frowned and pulled a cigar out 
of a desk drawer. After lighting 
up, he said, “Merlin planets are dif- 
ferent. You can say that in spades. 



They have a funny chemistry and a 
funny minerology. That’s why we are 
in here. Endive produces one of the 
most remarkable natural essences 
ever discovered. There is a big de- 
mand for it, and so far nobody has 
come close to synthesizing it. 

“The trouble with the place is that 
there is something about it that is — 
well, call it hallucinogenic if you 
like. If somebody spells you into be- 
ing a frog, you think you are a frog 
and so does everybody else, including 
the animals.” 

“You mean it’s an illusion. A hyp- 
notic gas in the atmosphere or some- 
thing like that.” 

“Scratch the hynotic gas and any- 
thing like that. Consolidated spent a 
whole year with their regional re- 
search staff trying to isolate a physi- 
cal cause, and they couldn’t do it. 
They ended up with some mishmash 
about psionic feedback, which might 
satisfy them, but it didn’t help us 
any. We still had to come in here 
pretty much helpless at first, or lose 
the franchise. 

“Call it mass hypnosis, if it makes 
you any more comfortable. Only 
there’s a strange side effect on En- 
dive. Given the necessary environ- 
ment for good frog survival, you can 
last indefinitely. As a frog, that is.” 

“But how — ” 

“That’s the reason for the postu- 
late of psionic feedback. The ecology 
is stable. An enchanted frog is just as 
good as a natural one here on En- 
dive.” 

Finn quickly held up a hand to 
forestall any more discussion. “Just 
accept it as a local difficulty in doing 
business. Think you can do that?” 



80 



IF 




“I’ll try,” said Jerrold uncertainly. 
“Good. Now for your counter- 
magic.” Finn dumped some ashes 
from his cigar and smiled. “With 
your background, you won’t have a 
bit of trouble. The local wizards can’t 
touch you.” 

J errold listened and found himself 
saying, “That’s nice. Why?” 

“All you have to do is go through 
some fairly elaborate mathematical 
pattern in your head. Like, for in- 
stance, solving Bessel’s equation.” 
“Bessel’s equation,” murmured 
Jerrold. 

“Well, it doesn’t have to be Bessel’s 
equation necessarily. That’s just an 
example. It happens that my favorite 
counter-spell is LaPlace’s equation in 
cylindrical coordinates. By the time 
I’ve separated the variables and got 
into the Bessel part of it, every wiz- 
ard within spitting distance is com- 
pletely terrified. Nobody knows why, 
but the local wizards can feel it when 
you just think this sort of thing at 
them.” 

“Who,” asked Jerrold, “is Bessel?” 
Finn looked at him with surprise. 
“You mean to tell me a math major 
never heard of Bessel’s equation?” 

“I am not a math major,” Jerrold 
replied. He drew his new degree from 
his tunic and handed it over. “My 
major was interstellar business. That’s 
mostly Taw, with a little non-techni- 
cal engineering.” 

“Gh, no!” Now it was Finn’s turn 
to be disconcerted. “I specifically 
asked them for a first class mathema- 
tician. They told me that they had 
hired some of them at Centaurus 
General Multiversity.” 



“That’s my school, all right,” Jer- 
rold told him. “But I haven’t had a 
math course in fourteen years. Would 
a little elementary trig help?” 

“I doubt it,” said Finn. “What a 
mixup!” He raised his voice and 
shouted, “Arline!” Then he turned 
back to Jerrold. “You are sure you 
don’t know something just a little 
more advanced and complete? A lit- 
tle calculus, maybe?” 

Jerrold shook his head. 

“This is bad,” said Finn. When his 
secretary entered, he said, “Where’s 
the requisition on this new operative, 
Arline? I asked for math, and the 
idiots sent me law.” 

“Oh, dear,” said Arline. She glanc- 
ed sympathetically at Jerrold, then 
went to a file cabinet. She drew out 
of it a large, bulky folder and set it 
in front of Finn. “That is the com- 
plete correspondence.” 

F or several minutes, the director 
went through the records in the 
file folder and finally slammed it 
shut. “As I read it, it says math grads 
are very expensive this year and 
that they are afraid my budget might 
not be able to handle the cost. So I 
guess we’re stuck with him.” 

Jerrold remembered those job in- 
terviews. Law grads were as common 
this season as the math grads were 
scarce. If he hadn’t spent so much 
time on his hobby, he would have 
been high enough on the honors list 
to compensate, and thus get one of 
the glamorous assignments. Unfor- 
tunately, although he could memorize 
an entire chess game, he discovered 
in the final exams that legal prece- 
dents were something else again. 



MERLIN PLANET 



81 




He said, “Maybe I could memo- 
rize one of your math patterns. I’ve 
got a pretty good memory for some 
things.” 

“No good,” grumbled Finn. “We 
tried that already. Unless you under- 
stand the significance of the pattern, 
it doesn’t work.” 

“Surely there must be something 
else — ” 

“It’s too new to tell. The research 
boys at Regional Headquarters say 
that the sophisticated evocation of a 
complete, self-consistent logical pat- 
tern like mathematics interferes with 
local patterns already resonant in the 
psionic feedback net. At least as far 
as magic is concerned. But until they 
find out precisely how and why, 
we’re stuck with the way we do it 
now.” 

“Then I guess I better go back 
and try to get reassigned.” 

“Too late for that,” said Finn. 
“Endive is too far off the main se- 
quence of Zipstar routes. There won’t 
be another boat in here for six 
months.” He shrugged. “So, if you 
are going to stay, you might as well 
get to work.” 

“But is it safe, Boss?” Arline asked 
earnestly. “Remember how it was 
when we first came here.” 

“I remember. We nearly lost half 
a dozen operatives before we acci- 
dentally found out about the math 
bit. But that was a few years ago. 
Things are different now. Every wiz- 
ard in the area knows that we are 
able to throw a counter-spell at them 
that will ruin their magic for weeks. 
And their whole business is magic, 
right?” 

Arline agreed doubtfully. 



“Well, then. Who around here 
knows that this fellow can’t counter- 
spell with the best of us? All he 
needs is a wand.” 

“Why of coursel” exclaimed Ar- 
line enthusiastically. “If they think 
he is a wizard like the rest of us, 
they will be afraid to challenge him.” 

44TT^hat’s this about a wand?” 
▼ ▼ asked Jerrold. 

“You have to have a magic wand 
if you are going to be a magician, 
don’t you?” Finn asked with a smile. 
Then he went on more seriously. 

“We all know a little math, here, 
but there isn’t a single one of us 
who is really good at it. So what we 
do is take a walking stick and carve 
the key steps on it. It is very much 
like an ancient Irish ogam stick. 
For those of us who know the code, 
it’s a mnemonic device. For the En- 
dese, it’s a magic wand. 

“It’s a pity we couldn’t get a real- 
ly good mathematician in here. He 
might be able to neutralize the whole 
region for months, and it would be 
easier for us. What’s more, somebody 
like that might be able to teach 
enough math to the serfs so that they 
might be able to protect themselves. 

“Meanwhile,” Finn concluded, “we 
have work to do. Fix this fellow up 
with some kind of wand, Arline. 
Then take him over to the sheriff 
with you and report that beggar. An- 
asa isn’t going to be much interested 
in just a beggar, I guess, but it’s the 
least we can do to help the poor 
guy.” 

The Director turned back to his 
cluttered desk, and Jerrold left with 
Arline.

S heriff Anasa was short, squat and 
muscular, and he wore his wiz- 
ard’s hood carelessly thrown back, 
revealing curly, blond hair. He was, 
as Finn predicted, not very enthusias- 
tic about the frog. 

“All right,” he grumbled. “So 
some silly beggar got himself chang- 
ed into a frog. What am I supposed 
to do about it?” 

“But this is a human being,” in- 
sisted Arline. 

“No, it isn’t,” replied Anasa cross- 
ly. “It is a frog. You said so yourself. 
Do you expect me to chase down 
every frog in the village and try to 
invert the spell? It would take me all 
afternoon.” 

Arline said, “Director Finn be- 
lieves that Eilen is the magician who 
did it.” 

Immediately, Anasa sat up and 
looked at her intently. “Eilen? I was 
told that he might be in the neigh- 
borhood. You have a witness?” 
Arline indicated Jerrold: 

“Ah.” The sheriff turned to Jer- 
rold and said, “Can you positively 
identify Eilen?” 

Jerrold shook his head. “I can de- 
scribe him, but I never saw him be- 
fore. There were others in the square, 
though, who might be more familiar 
with your man. Why don’t you ask 
them?” 

“You Farofflanders have odd cus- 
toms,” Anasa replied. “Here we do 
not take the testimony of serfs. Ev- 
en,” he added scornfully, “if they 
could say anything useful. And if it 
were Eilen, they will be afraid to 
incur his wrath by telling me about 
it. Let me hear your story, just as 
you remember it.” 



Jerrold related the event, omitting 
nothing. 

A nasa nodded slowly. “It certainly 
does sound like Eilen. But you 
don’t know whether there was a chal- 
lenge, since you are not familiar with 
our customs. If Eilen offered the 
proper challenge and the man ac- 
cepted, then it was all perfectly legal. 
There is nothing against the law if 
two wizards have a contest, provided 
no innocent bystander wizards are 
injured.” 

“Can’t serfs be innocent bystand- 
ers?” 

“Who cares about serfs? They are 
powerless and easily replaced.” 

“It would seem,” said Jerrold, 
“that this one cannot. The beggar is 
the only one who can give you the 
information you seek, and he is now 
a frog. Perhaps, however, a great 
wizard like yourself. Sheriff, can 
cause a frog to speak.” 

The slur was not lost on Anasa. 
“You have a quick tongue,” he snap- 
ped. “I noticed in your story that 
you were frightened. This is perfect- 
ly understandable for those who 
know no magic, but I see you bear 
a wand.” He indicated the newly 
carved walking stick in Jerrold’s hand. 

“He was new here,” Arline put in 
quickly. “We have, as you say, dif- 
ferent customs.” 

The sheriff shrugged his heavy 
shoulders and let the point pass. 

“I was just curious,” he said. “As 
I am sure Eilen naust have been. To 
me it is unimportant. What is impor- 
tant is that Eilen is a rogue and 
should be imprisoned in a large block 
of granite. Unfortunately, so far he 



MERLIN PLANET 



83 




has managed to avoid any public vio- 
lation of the law. Perhaps the beggar 
might have to be consulted, after all.” 
He stood up. “So. Now if you will 
forgive me, I must set about investi- 
gating that fool frog.” 

I t took Jerrold several days to fa- 
miliarize himself with the opera- 
tion that Consolidated Enterprises 
was conducting on Endive. The bar- 
ter deal itself was simple. Essence 
was distilled in the countryside, with 
the aid of certain insects. Eventually, 
it was shipped to Arrey by caravan, 
where Finn traded a low grade of 
bullion for it. About every six 
months, a Zipstar boat dropped down 
under camouflage radiation to pick 
it up. 

The background was more compli- 
cated. For many years. Central Au- 
thority had the policy of permitting 
the assimilation of any planet that 
could maintain its cultural identity 
within a galactic civilization. This 
meant that any technological changes 
must be initiated by the populace of 
the planet in question. Endive, mired 
in the confusion of an effective 
magic, was technologically helpless. 
Physical law seemed to change al- 
most with the wind; or at least upon 
the whim of some overlord wizard. 
The common serf, from whom prog- 
ress ultimately must come, could do 
nothing to help himself. 

Such a planet must be monitored. 
Survey teams were costly to field, 
however, so certain carefully re- 
stricted commercial activity was per- 
mitted as the most economical way 
of keeping tabs on the place. Un- 
mentioned was the fact that this was 



also the way, long sanctioned by tra- 
dition and practice, for the dissemina- 
tion of civilization. 

Finn showed Jerrold a sketchily- 
drawn map on the wall of his office. 
“You can see the territory where we 
operate,” he explained. “It may not 
seem large to you, but by the time 
you have made the rounds, you will 
realize how slow travel is in a primi- 
tive place like this.” 

“I understand,” said Jerrold. 
“The principal means of transport is 
a jagoHy which looks like a horse but 
travels like a donkey.” 

“Right. Another problem we have 
is information. For instance.” He 
tapped a location in the distant 
mountains. “Here is the Satrapy of 
Bengal. This usually is a rich source 
of essence, but something has hap- 
pened up there. I don’t know what 
the trouble is, but the caravan Ben- 
gal sends to Arrey at this time of the 
year hasn’t arrived. Your first assign- 
ment is to go up there and find out 
what happened to it.” 

Jerrold studied the map with care. 
“That looks like a week’s trip, pro- 
viding I don’t get lost.” 

“About that, but you shouldn’t 
have much trouble. I can provide you 
with a guide who knows the way. As 
a rule, the intervening region is in- 
fested by bandit wizards, but accord- 
ing to Sheriff Anasa the bandits seem 
to have moved elsewhere this sum- 
mer. He is worried about it. They 
sometimes hire out as mercenaries, 
and that makes it more difficult for 
him to control them.” 

“Maybe they waylaid the cara- 
van,” Jerrold suggested. 

“Possibly. Not very likely, though, 

IF 



84 




because Bengal usually sends a cou- 
ple of squads of his soldiers with the 
caravan. He has a good-sized army 
of wizards to maintain his authority 
there in the mountains.” 

T he trip proved uneventful for the 
first two days. Like most En- 
dese, the guide was no wizard, but he 
was stoic about the powers that be 
in the universe. Also, like most En- 
dese, he had no name other than that 
of his job. 

On the third night, they bedded 
down by a delightful fresh brook, 
teeming with fish. Guide caught some 
and cooked them, while Jerrold sat 
on the grass and studied his map. 

“Ordinarily,” said Guide, “such a 
pleasant place as this would be used 
only by a large convoy. It is too ob- 
vious a stopping place for the night. 
And the bandits like to strike at 
night.” 

“We haven’t seen any so far,” Jer- 
rold pointed out. 

“True,” agreed Guide. “But there 
is always the first time. I am grate- 
ful to be in the company of a Far- 
offlander wizard in such a place.” 
Jerrold looked around the pleas- 
ant countryside in some alarm. It 
seemed peaceful enough, except for a 
large, dense forest in the distance. He 
asked about that. 

“In the forest there are lions,” said 
Guide. “Who knows? Some of them 
may be enchanted people, but their 
appetites are those of lions.” 

As Jerrold considered what sort of 
animal might be considered a lion on 
Endive, Guide added, “It is fortunate 
that they do not stray far from the 
forest.” 



Nevertheless, shortly after the sun 
set, their pack animals appeared rest- 
less. Guide went to quiet them, and 
when he returned he said quietly, ‘T 
think we are not alone in this valley. 
Might I suggest a small protective 
spell?” 

Jerrold’s mouth was dry. He said, 
“Better stir up the fire.” 

“Of course,” Guide murmured. “I 
forget that you Farofflanders use 
light when you make your magic.” 

He quickly stirred up the fire and 
threw on more fuel, but its light did 
not do much to dispel the gloomy 
shadows surrounding them. Soon 
there came a low snarl from not far 
away, and the pack animals imme- 
diately commenced a tumult. Reluc- 
tantly, the two men picked up torches 
and went to investigate. 

The tumult continued, and in the 
dim light cast by the torches, Jerrold 
could just make out the cause, its 
eyes glowing. 

“Wizard Aix,” cried the Guide. 
‘‘Cast your spell quickly.” 

L acking a spell to cast, Jerrold 
threw his torch, but the big cat 
merely snarled and stepped nimbly 
aside. That left him with his wand as 
his only weapon. It was heavy 
enough, so he prepared to wield it as 
a club. About this time, the lion 
vanished. In its place stood the ban- 
dit, Eilen. 

“I wish no conflict with a Faroff- 
lander,” said Eilen, his voice deep 
and mournful. 

Jerrold decided that the best de- 
fense under the circumstances was 
arrogance. “Then leave us,” he or- 
dered. 



MERLIN PLANET 



85 




“In due time,” murmured the wiz- 
ard in his bass voice. “For a moment, 
I thought you intended to club me 
to death with that wand, instead of 
casting a proper spell.” 

“Would you like me to cast one 
now?” demanded Jerrold, brandish- 
ing the wand threateningly. 

For the space of perhaps ten sec- 
onds, Eilen considered the question. 
Then he said, “You feared me in the 
village. True, you held no wand at 
the time. Now you have a wand, yet 
you hold it like a club, rather than 
the mystic device that it should be. 
I find this interesting, and I shall 
think further on it.” 

His manner changed. “I have 
claimed this wilderness as my do- 
main. Therefore it is suitable that you 
pay me a tribute.” 

“I pay you nothing,” snapped Jer- 
rold. 

“Perhaps,” said Eilen. “Perhaps. 
You have given me much to think 
upon. At the naoment, however, I am 
in a hurry to reach my destination, 
so I must leave you. But do not for- 
get that you owe me a tribute. I shall 
exact it when the time is ripe.” 

With that he moved back into the 
shadows and disappeared. 

The two men returned to the fire, 
and Jerrold asked Guide his opinion 
of the affair. 

“Eilen means you no good,” said 
Guide thoughtfully. “If he was in- 
deed in a hurry, then we probably 
will not see any more of him this 
trip. However, one day he will not 
be in a hurry.” 

He shrugged and settled down on 
his blanket. As an afterthou^t, he 
said, “Almost it seemed as if he were 



going to challenge you. This is very 
strange behavior. One might even 
think that he does not regard you as 
a wizard.” 

J errold got little sleep that night. 

He spent the time going over in 
his mind the whole illogical situation. 
The Endese had magic. Magic was 
illogical. There was a psionic feed- 
back network operative on Endive, 
according to Finn. This might be log- 
ical, but why should it be that the 
thinking through of a complicated 
mathematical theorem interfered with 
the magic? Jerrold knew little math, 
but he was convinced that the 
most important thing about math was 
consistency of logic. Beginner’s math 
was of no value, so Finn had indi- 
cated, because it did not represent a 
complete system. The conclusion, 
therefore, must be that it was neces- 
sary to have recourse to a complete, 
logical system in which there was no 
room for the non-causal relations 
which represented magic. 

Eventually, he drifted into a doze, 
trying to think about complete, logi- 
cal systems in which no non-causal 
relations existed. 

They did not see Eilen the next 
day, and soon they were wending 
their way through the foothills of the 
Satrapy of Bengal. The rugged coun- 
tryside gave way to small, tilled fields 
with serfs at work in them, and the 
outhouses where the essence was dis- 
tilled. Finally they came to the village 
itself. 

The news of their arrival spread 
quickly, and it was only minutes 
after their entry that they were met 
by a squad of hooded soldiers who 



86 



IF 




insisted that they follow. In a short 
time, they found themselves in a 
large encampment overlooking a val- 
ley. The satrap emerged from his tent 
to greet them. 

“Welcome, Farofflander,” said 
Bengal heartily. He came right to the 
point. “Accept my apologies that 
pressing business has delayed the usu- 
al caravan of essence.” 

Jerrold nodded and looked around 
at the grouping of disciplined sol- 
diers, their capes thrown back in the 
cool mountain air. 

“You have quite an army here,” he 
said. 

“Of course I have an army,” re- 
plied Bengal. “I am at war with the 
Satrap of Bichardy.” He pointed to 
an encampment on the opposing hill. 

“Usually my forces are adequate to 
defend my realm, but Bichardy has 
enlisted mercenaries. He has made 
them many promises of wealth and 
glory for the taking. For two months, 
we have watched each other like 
jackals, so evenly matched that nei- 
ther of us could make a decisive 
move.” 

J errold said, “Indeed. Your realm 
seemed quite peaceful as we ap- 
proached.” 

“Of course it is peaceful,” shouted 
Bengal. “Do you think my wizards 
have been idle? Many a sneak attack 
in the night has been met by sneak 
defense. It is a tiresome thing, not to 
be able to attack like a civilized per- 
son. Yet if I were to send a squad of 
lion conjures at him, he would coun- 
ter with tiger conjures. Firebreathers 
are met by deluge-makers. 

“No, we have been too evenly 



matched to fight it out, but the 
change has come. Only this morning, 
Bichardy was joined by a group of 
stragglers from the wilderness. This 
will tempt him to attack. We should 
know soon.” 

“Perhaps,” suggested Jerrold with 
care, “it might be better for me to 
watch the event from some more dis- 
tant vantage point.” 

“By no means,” Bengal insisted 
firmly. “As I say, the denouement is 
at hand. Bichardy has twenty more 
soldiers. But I have a Farofflander 
who wants the essence from my 
fields.” 

Jerrold shook his head. “There is 
nothing I can do to help you. My 
organization is committed to neutral- 
ity in such conflicts.” 

“Of course. And nobody is more 
desirous than I of seeing to it that 
your attitude remains unchanged. But 
remember that you are here to get 
essence. You will not get it from 
Bichardy. He is not a builder, like 
me. He is a raider, a destroyer.” 

The satrap became more earnest. 
“I do not ask that you cast a spell 
on Bichardy. Simply let him know 
that you are my ally. This will strike 
fear in the black hearts of his follow- 
ers.” 

A messenger came pounding up 
the trail and panted, “Highness, the 
Satrap of Bichardy has signaled that 
he wishes to parley.” 

Bengal frowned. “Strange,” he 
said. “I would rather expect an at- 
tack. But come with me, Faroff- 
lander. This provides me with my 
opportunity. Merely to show yourself 
at my side should suffice to ensure 
peace in this countryside.” 



88 



IF 




It was a hard argument to resist. 
Jerrold took a firm grip on his wand, 
displaying it conspicuously, and 
marched down into the valley beside 
Bengal. 

Bichardy also brought an aid. With 
a thrill of somehow alienated fear, 
Jerrold saw that it was Eilen. 

T hey met, and Bengal shouted, 
“Enough of this, Bichardy. You 
see my ally. Leave my lands, and 
nothing further will be done to you. 
Attack, and you attack a Faroff- 
lander.” 

“We will have a contest,” insisted 
Bichardy in his turn. “My man 
against yours.” 

“You dare challenge a Faroffland- 
er?” asked the astounded Bengal. 

“My man says that he knows this 
Farofflander. He says that this Far- 
offlander is afraid of him, ran in ter- 
ror when first they met, and later 
failed to defend himself properly 
against the threat of my man’s en- 
chantment. 

“I know nothing of this, myself,” 
Bichardy added. “This I do know. 
If my man is wrong, I am already 
defeated, for the Farofflander can 
ruin my army with a single spell. But 
if my man is right, I think I can 
defeat you, Bengal. And our battle 
is now long overdue.” 

Bengal glanced sharply at Jerrold. 
“Can this be true?” he demanded 
angrily. But he did not wait for an 
answer. He turned back to Bichardy 
and said, “I accept.” 

With that, he strode from the 
field without a backward look. 

A few minutes later, Jerrold and 
Eilen alone occupied the valley. 



“I have considered your behavior 
in detail/’ Eilen said in his deep» 
mournful voice. ‘T have conduded 
that althou^ you now bear a wand» 
you do not understand the use of it 
You are like the first Faxofflanders 
that came here, helpless as a serL 
“Also, you will recall that I told 
you I would exact a tribute from you 
when the time was ripe. Siodi a time 
is now at hand. You will be the tod 
of my aggrandizement, for I shall be 
famous for having beaten you. Many 
people will fear my name. In time, I 
shall replace Bichardy himself as lord 
of the mountahfTs.” 

Jerrold found himself saying, “Bta 
suppose you are wrong al^t me?” 
Eilen shook his head, his smile 
confident. “I am not wrong, Faroff- 
lander. That wand is useless to you.” 
Slowly, as a cat torments a mouse, 
he prepared for the final, terrible 
gesture. 

“You are right about the wand,” 
Jerrold told him. “But you are wrong 
about me. I need no wand.” 

He began his chant out loud. For 
a moment, Eilen stood transfixed. 
Then the full significance of the 
counter-spell bore down upon him; 
he clutched his head in agony and 
fled. 

F inn was pleased, in spite of the 
fact that Jerrold returned with- 
out the essence. “That’s great, Aix,” 
he said. “I’ll have to let the research 
boys know about this. When did you 
figure it out?” 

“The night Eilen visited us. I de- 
cided that even if I didn’t know any 
of your kind of systematic logic, I 
had my own. There is nothing so in-

mute the fear that all men feel! 



T here were only three things to 
which he might look forward 
now. Possibly four. He would not be 
certain of the fourth until he found 
it, or it found him. 

He stood beside a marble bench 
in a garden filled with flowers. There 
was no sun in sight, but a diffuse 
brightness like morning or evening 
filled the place, and a breeze that was 
cool moved the leaves and the 
branches. 

He seated himself on the bench 
and regarded the colors of the flow- 
ers, their fragrances strong in his 
nostrils. As he sat there, a final touch 
of remorseful oblivion dropped from 
his consciousness, was gone. 

Then, somewhere far behind him, 
it began, a single note, rising and 
rising in pitch, until it approximated 
the scream of a freight train passing 
in the distance. Abruptly, his hands 



began to shake, and he jammed them 
into his pockets and balled them in- 
to fists. 

Then it died. The song of the blue 
baboon was finished. 

The garden came alive with the 
sounds of insects and birds. 

He turned when he heard the 
footfall, and she was standing there 
on the flagstone walk, her pale blue 
blouse open at the throat, her black 
slacks cuffed high above white san- 
dals. Her Carmel hair still touched 
her shoulders, and she smiled as she 
touched his. 

“Kenneth.” 

He rose to his feet, and she was 
in his arms. 

“Sandra!” he said, and drew her 
down on the bench beside him. 

They sat there a long, silent time, 
his arm about her shoulders. Then, 
“It was strange,” he said. 



91 




“Strange that you became a hero? 
Many things were forgiven on the 
Day of Liberation, to those who 
fought.” 

“No,” he said. “Strange that you 
came back to me. I never thought 
I’d see you again.” 

He plucked a ^ite camellia and 
wove it into her hair. 

“You couldn’t really have been a 
traitor, or you wouldn’t have fought 
on that day, the day we liberated 
Earth,” she said, and she stroked 
his cheek as she said it. 

He smiled. “I was weak,” he said, 
“but never a traitor. They were 
wrong about me, all along.” 

“I know. Everyone knows now. It’s 
aU right. Forget it.” 

But he could not. The rats at the 
back of his mind began to gnaw upon 
the corpse of a memory. What? What 
was it? 

He sprang to his feet and stared 
down into her dark eyes through the 
wet curtains that covered tiiem now. 

“You’re not telling me the whole 
truth. Something’s wrong. What is 
it?” 

She shook her head slowly and 
rose to her feet. He moved away, 
then turned his back on her. 

“Three things . What are the 
other two?” he asked. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking 
about,” he heard her say. 

“Then I have to find out.” 

There was silence. He waited a 
time, then turned around. 

She was gone. 

H e moved along the walk until he 
came to a path, winding down- 
ward to his right through a stand 



of broad-leafed trees. He heard a 
sound of splashing water, from that 
direction. He followed it. 

The man beside the stream had his 
back to him, but he recognized him 
frmn a gesture: a quick flick of his 
thumb toward his head, to moisten 
it; and then the hand was lowered to 
seal the cigarette paper he held. A 
flare of light, and a moment later 
smoke swirled back over his shoul- 
der. 

He turned, and they regarded one 
another. 

‘'Roscoe ...” he said. 

The man lowered his cigarette, 
stroked his black beard, spat abrupt- 
ly. He wore khakis under a dirty 
field jacket; a pistol hung at his side. 

‘Tig!” he said, raising his ciga- 
rette like an accusing finger. 

“What’s wrong, Roscoe?” 

“What’s right, animal?” 

“i don’t ...” 

“You betrayed us during the inva- 
sion! You sold out your lower to 
those blue — baboons! — from an- 
other world! It might have stood! We 
might have won! But because you be- 
trayed us, they enslaved the human 
race!” 

“No!” he said. “I didn’t!” 

“You gave them information! You 
were well paid for it!” 

Then he remembered his tower 
group in the sea, so large a destroy- 
er looked like a toy beside it. He re- 
membered the swelling green of the 
Atlantic, far below his station. He 
had sat there at his post as such a 
vessel passed. He was one of the 
three workers at UN Automated 
Defense Station 7. The other two 
were dead by then or wishing that

IF 




they were, for first one fool and 
then the other had been taken away 
by the blue-furred Kheean, who had 
seemed to come out of nowhere the 
previous evening without even dis- 
turbing the radar. Baboon-like they 
raged through the station, sometimes 
moving on all fours, their song of 
triumph a single, mounting shriek 
that rose and blared like a diesel’s 
whistle. He imagined they occupied 
the station completely. Two of them 
guarded the cell in which he remain- 
ed. He remembered, he remem- 
bered . 

“I let them pay me to destroy sus- 
picion,” he said. “There’s a difference 
between useful and useless informa- 
tion. Everything I told them was use- 
less.” 

“You rationalize, traitor, for you 
could not have known what would 
have been useful to them. Then you 
let them pamper you, for six years, 
as a factory supervisor.” 

“I was working with the under- 
ground the full time, you know that, 
getting ready for the Day.” 

“I think maybe you worked both 
sides, but it doesn’t matter.” 

“Why not?” 

“You’re going to die.” 

“You are going to kill me?” 

“I’ve already killed you,” 

“I don’t follow you . .” 

Roscoe laughed, then stopped 
abruptly at the sound of Sandra’s 
voice: 

“. And it means nothing that 
he fought bravely on the Day of 
Liberation?” she asked, stepping into 
sight along the trail. 

Roscoe blew smoke and looked 
away. 



4 4 Qo you summon your good angel 
to defend you,” he said 
finally. “What sort of tale ijs it that 
she tells? You were a coward on 
the day we rose up. You ran!” 
“That’s not so!” 

“Then why is it that I myself had 
to shoot you, for desertion under fire 
— all the bullets in the back?” 
Kenneth clasped his forehead, 
rubbed it. 

‘‘It’s not true. I was shot by the 
enemy.” 

“You were killed by me, and she 
knows it! You know it!” 

“I — I’m not dead . .” 

“At this very moment they are 
probably typing up your death cer- 
tificate, and your vital organs are on 
their way out, for transplant into 
some real human being. You know 
it! They gave you the drug that 
kills the pain, makes the final sec- 
onds seem like hours. Gives you il- 
lusions too, to pass the time. You 
are talking only to yourself. There 
can be no lying here! Admit it, you 
are a traitor and a coward!” 

“No!” 

“You twist everything,” said San- 
dra. *'You are fear and natural hu- 
man guilt. He was a hero of the 
revolution.” 

“We lost the revolution. We have 
lost the entire Earth, because of the 
likes of him! You are wishful think- 
ing. You are the final coverup.” 

“We did not lose! We won, be- 
cause of men like him! You know 
it!” 

And Kenneth stood straight. At 
first unsure, then smiling. He said, 
“Now I understand. All men fear 
the final instant of their lives, and

they wish to judge themselves and be 
judged, be found not wanting — 
“They wish to rationalize and 
cloak with illusion,” said Roscoe, “as 
you have done. But they know in the 
end, as you will know.” 

There came the sound of a trum- 
pet from across the stream, then the 
sounds of other instruments. Some- 
where, a brass band was playing 
march music. 

Kenneth pointed in the direction 
of the music. 

“Three things. Subconsciously, I 
knew there’d be time for perhaps 
three important things. Let me be 
judged by whatever approaches!” 
They crossed the stream, moving 
from stone to stone, wading through 
shallows. They mounted the hill these 
faced and looked down upon the 
broad highway that passed before it. 
There were buildings along its way, 
some of them in ruin, all of them 
fenced by throngs of cheering peo- 
ple. The pageant moved into sight. It 
was the armies of the Liberation 
passing in review. None wore real 



uniforms and all looked dirty and 
tired, but they stood erect and march- 
ed in stride, soon to be decked with 
flowers and bits of colored paper. As 
one, they began singing, and their 
voices mingled, though each seemed 
to be singing a different song. The 
national anthems of all the peoples 
Of the Earth blended together into 
the Song of Man that poured forth 
from their throats, rose above the 
cheering. 

“There is your answer, Roscoe!” 
he cried out. “I was right! Well go 
to them!” 

The bearded man moved down the 
hill to join the passing troupe. Ken- 
neth took a step, then turned and 
held out his hand. 

Sandra had vanished. 

A white something fluttered at his 
feet, and he bent forward to pick it 
up. He saw that it was the camellia 
he had woven into her hair, and 
even as he raised the flower, its cen- 
ter turned a dark, darkening color 
that spread like a rising, single stain 
over all — END

Illustrated by instead, they just whither away 



I 

M urpho’s Morgue was one of the 
places that made life on Otho 
IV tolerable. The old building was 
no less alien than other Isopteran 
ruins taken over by the Project. In 
fact Securityman .Cliff Savill had 
lately found there was something 



about the alien building that was get- 
ting on his nerves. But in it Murpho 
offered a variety of foods, Androme- 
dian brandy and Terran beer.- And 
his partner, Molly Cato, made your 
day by just being there. 

It followed that the Molly watch- 
ers, an unofficial group which defin- 
itely included Cliff Savill, plus the 



95 




eaters, the drinkers, the talkers and 
the loafers, stopped at the Morgue 
every evening. So did the workers 
from the big OMA R & D Lab 
nearby. And while Securityman Sa- 
vill knew OMA’s Miss Larkin slight- 
ly, he was surprised when this time 
she hurried directly to his table. 

He was also faintly amused, watch- 
ing the usual falling-domino succes- 
sion of swiveling heads mark her 
progress across the room. The amuse- 
ment lasted through the time it took 
to make room on one of the Old 
Alien wall shelves Murpho used as 
benches. By then it was plain she 
had not just stopped with the others 
for a day-end drink. Hers was any- 
thing but small talk. And presently 
she closed icy fingers around his 
wrist. 

“But Mr. Savill you aren’t listen- 
ing! Mack Weymouth was murder-- 
edr 

He had been listening. He just 
hadn’t liked it. 

His first thought was that she had 
to be wrong. Not murder! Not here! 
The Project homicide rate was zero. 
He rejected that, laying it to a re- 
luctance to admit this Securityman’s 
dream job might be turning into the 
real thing. But honesty made him 
realize that wouldn’t scarf. He had 
never backed away from any job. 

Finally, reluctantly, he admitted 
the real reason his mind kept lunging 
away like a gaffed sailfish; she was 
accusing Molly Cato of being at the 
very least an accessory to murder! 

His face felt stiff, and Miss Larkin 
was staring anxiously at it. She said, 
“You don’t believe me!” 

“I hear what you say. Go on.” 



“I told you. Mack simply disap- 
peared, three months ago. But today, 
just now, I overheard some Rug Row 
talk, a front-office intercom left open. 
They think those two people who own 
this place murdered Mack, because of 
something that was found here. What- 
ever it is, OMA wants it. So they’re 
trying to blackmail Mr. Murpho and 
that big blonde girl.” 

S avill forced his mind to stop fight- 
ing the gaff. He wouldn’t have 
used that description for Molly Cato. 
But even leaving her out, he didn’t 
like the words blackmail and murder. 
Yet blackmail as a business gambit 
was not unknown. Render it seman- 
tically acceptable, and Otho Mining 
Associates would be capable of it. As 
for murder, there’s a murky cave in 
every mind where an ape squats 
drooling. He could even recall flashes 
of angry fantasy which had left him 
feeling guilty and ashamed. 

“You’re certain of what you 
heard?” 

“Yes! And when they found out I 
had, they threatened to send me back 
to Terra. They don’t want the murder 
reported. It would break up their 
ploy. And it sounded like they meant 
to see that I couldn*t talk about it!*’ 
“Who are they?'* 

“One voice was too faint. Mr. 
Kotch came after me. I — I ran. And 
Mack told me once he was sure Mr. 
Murpho had something valuable right 
here, in this building. And didn’t 
want anyone to know about it.” 
Savill frowned. Murpho being se- 
cretive about a find? Hell, you un- 
cover something big, you put it up for 
bid and go home rich. That was the 



96 



IF 




whole idea behind the Project. Ho 
tried another tack. “Maybe your 
friend really is only missing. This 
blast desert is big and empty, and 
most of it is still up for grabs. 
Couldn’t he have just gone out on his 
own, prospecting? People do.” 

“No. He’d have told me. Don’t 
you see? OMA doesn’t want his mur- 
der reported. There’s something right 
here they want and they think they 
can get it from these people who own 
it if only . .” 

He felt another icy tremor go up 
his arm. She had gripped his wrist 
again and her wide black eyes were 
pleading. “Please! Here comes that 
Mr. Kotch! I’m afraid to go back 
there again!” 

He felt a flare of anger at himself. 
Her story was not unreasonable. As 
part of Security, he didn’t like the 
thought of murder on the Project. As 
Cliff Savill, he liked even less the 
implication that Molly Cato might be 
involved. But both Miss Larkin’s 
voice and her manner had the feel of 
truth. And now the coarse-featured, 
dull-eyed Kotch, obviously bearing 
down on their table, strengthened that 
impression. 

Savill knew Kotch, a new man and 
a deputy to a near-summit OMA As- 
sociate. There was a lot of arrogance 
in his walk and his voice. He ignored 
Savill and fixed licorice-dull eyes on 
the girl. “Larkin, I warned you about 
repeating that crazy lie!” 

S avill stood up. “What lie, Kotch? 
We were discussing the weather.” 
The black eyes shifted. “This is 
OMA business. I heard what she’s 
been saying, and she’s blown her 



mind. She’s going back to talk with 
the boss. Now!” 

“He can talk at Security Center. 
m take the snooper mike, Kotch.” 
“You’ll take a trip to the infirmary 
if you butt in. Come on, Larkin!” 
Savill let out his breath. Roughing 
up OMA Brass was non-regulation. 
At any rate, pressure from OMA had 
created the vacancy he had been hired 
to fill. But he kept his hand out and 
shifted his feet, watching Kotch’s jaw 
muscles. Not one man in fifty could 
start a serious move without clench- 
ing his teeth. Kotch was easy to read. 
He went down hard, and Savill’s 
thumb and forefinger at the base of 
his neck didn’t quite make him 
scream. 

“Regulation Twelve, Kotch! Right 
of Privacy!” 

Savill stepped away, perversely 
hoping Kotch would try again. But 
Kotch climbed to his feet and kept 
his distance. “Chief Cayhill will hear 
of this! You’ll be working some Ter- 
ran alley again, and soon!” 

“With you around I can’t see much 
difference, Kotch. As of now, Miss 
Larkin will be wearing a V & A spot- 
ter. If she yells for help, or if her 
light goes off the board without her 
clearing it, she’ll get help!” 

Kotch glared, and his fists clench- 
ed. But when Savill pocketed the 
snooper and brought out a Vid-Aud 
unit, checking it tersely to the Secur- 
ity Center Map Board, Kotch stamp- 
ed away. Miss Larkin kept a hand 
on Savill’s arm while he locked the 
spotter to her wrist. Her disconcert- 
ing eyes glowed gratitude, and she said 
throatily, “Thank you, Mr. Savill.” 
He waved it away. “You’ll be safe

anywhere in the City now. Report to 
the Center tomorrow early. Don’t let 
Chief Cayhill scare you. He bellows 
at everybody.” 

The Morgue’s clients were moving 
back to their seats when she walked 
out. There was a replay of the pattern 
of swiveling heads. Savill grinned. The 
Girl Who Walked. Then he sobered. 
There was some work to do. Kotch 
had been right on one point. This 
wasn’t a Terran slum. Even though, 
incredibly, some of the same kinds of 
trouble appeared to be shaping. He 
should have been prepared for that 
because of the nature of the Project 
itself. Otho IV was full of alien gadg- 
ets. Some were beyond comprehen- 
sion; most were ahead of Terra’s 
best. And even ten centuries after 
some Out-Star’s saturation H-treat- 
ment, a few were still flickering. 
Search and Salvage on Otho meant 
big money. And where there are Ter- 
rans and big money, there can be big 
trouble. 

Had big trouble hit the Project? If 
the frightened Miss Larkin’s story 
were to be believed, it sure as hell 
had. But his stomach started doing 
free-fall evolutions when he glimpsed 
Molly Cato across the room. Murpho 
^ — maybe. The Morgue Management, 
he thought wryly. A Beauty and a 
Beast. Old Murph did look menacing. 
He was bald as a boulder and shaped 
like one, and his thick neck spread 
with startling abruptness into a face 
like a catfish. But that didn’t make 
him a killer. He had said that, he re- 
called. And Miss Larkin had asked, 
wide eyed, “How can you tell? About 
anyone?” 

He had conceded that. Anybody’s 



ape could get loose. And it could 
have happened. Murpho could have 
found something valuable. Wey- 
mouth, an OMA man, could have 
learned of it, and Murph could have 
killed him. That last didn’t quite click, 
but the next item fit beautifully. 
OMA, knowing of it, wanted it — as 
always at their price. And what better 
way was there to impose a buyer’s 
market than to hold the threat of a 
murder charge over the seller? 

II 

H e sighed heavily. It had to bo 
checked out. He had to admit 
he might have complicated it by floor- 
ing and searching, however fruitfully, 
the assistant to one of the Associates 
at OMA. Otho Mining Associates was 
the largest and by far the most influ- 
ential of the S & S operators. And 
while the Project had about the same 
degree of democracy as a division of 
infantry, it was stiU free enterprise. 
Cayhill had pointed that out, when 
he hired Savill, 

The Chief had scowled under 
bushy eyebrows and compared Sa- 
vill’s face with the photocube. 
“Hummm. Six two, hundred eighty. 
Old picture. Your nose has a cant that 
doesn’t show here. Says you have the 
stupid — ah — insubordinate habit of 
not waiting for reinforcements. Well, 
you wouldn’t need reinforcements 
here. We screen out the gun toters.” 
“They leave their fists on the shut- 
tleboat?” 

“You brought in yours, didn’t you? 
But we’re not dealing with the same 
kinds of people you find in those 
Terran city streets. For you, this job

IF 




would be Rest and Recreation. I 
could start you at three-stripe rating, 
but you’d begin with rookie work — 
the Missing File. These people are 
mostly good heads. More Doctors per 
acre than most universities. But they 
do get lost. So we find ’em. In fact 
that’s about all we have to do. You 
want the job?” 

Savill had kept him in suspense a 
full five seconds. That zero homicide 
rate sounded restful. And it had been. 
Riding the computer-controlled float- 
ers, which actually was about all there 
was to do, made him wonder what 
was going to save a pragmatic type 
like himself from stark boredom. 
Then he discovered there was syntho- 
steak and Terran brew available, in 
quantity, at Murpho’s Morgue. 

And there, too, he discovered Mur- 
pho’s partner, Molly Cato. What had 
bothered him about that, and contin-* 
ued increasingly to bother him, was 
that so far she hadn’t seemed much 
impressed by the new Securityman. 
To her, he was just another client to 
be smiled at and talked to. He want- 
ed to be more than that. And now, 
for the first time since he’d met her, 
he felt something other than unmiti- 
gated pleasure at seeing her approadi 
his table. 

Why her covert watchfulness ear- 
lier, during Miss Larkin’s stay at his 
table? He pushed that implanted, un- 
welcome suspicion aside. It wasn’t 
difficult. A lot of the Project’s distaff 
side was out of the R & D mold: 
thin hair, thin lips, thin hips. Molly 
Cato was a notable exception. 

She was shoulder high to a big man, 
and her slanted black eyes didn’t, at 
first, seem to go with her yellow hair 



— and wouldn’t, on another face. 
Hers was one of those rare, memor- 
able faces where ordinary features 
blend into something extraordinary. 
She dropped a no-limit house token 
into the slot at the table as she sat 
down. But her slanted black eyes 
were faintly mocking. 

“Her Hero!” she jibed. “Why is it 
you never offer me the protection of 
that strong right arm? Weren’t you a 
little impetuous? That curtain act was 
classic but it sure won’t help your 
popularity rating around OMA.” 

S avill grinned. He had learned to 
sort out her conversation. Much 
of it was made up of questions to 
which she didn’t expect an answer. 
You replied to whatever she said last. 
He filled his glass, nodding thanks. 
“One of my burdens, Molly. Nobody 
loves the Securityman.” 

“This is true? You’re never around 
when I want you.” 

He grinned again. Molly talked like 
that. It was strictly an act, but Mor- 
gue clients, when so favored, liked it. 
So did he. Trouble was, he wanted 
her to mean it. But he found now, 
that he was uneasy, troubled by un- 
familiar guilt. He was going to have 
to be a cop on duty, weighing every 
word she said. He nodded toward the 
bar. “I see Murpho turned the place 
over to you. Molly, how did as ugly 
a man as Murpho ever talk you into 
a partnership?” 

She shrugged, a gesture worth ob- 
serving. “Easy. Murpho likes money 
and makes money. You just have to 
watch him to be sure you get your 
share of the loot.” 

“Where is he?” 



100 



IF 




She shrugged again. “His living 
quarters, I suppose. Where else could 
he go? How did that karate workout 
start? Men never fight over me. May- 
be if I learned how to walk . .” 

“Did you know Miss Larkin’s 
friend, Mack Weymouth?” 

“So you won’t talk. A gentleman. 
You mean that bad tempered engi- 
neer? He’s the one you should watch 
out for. He’s her guy, although he 
hasn’t been around for two, three 
months.” 

“Friend of Murpho’s?” 

“He and Murph used to tinker with 
the bar console. Mack is a fluidics 
man. They were trying to fix that 
booth back in the corner, but never 
did get it working. Mack hasn’t been 
around since the time your little 
friend with the eyes and the follow- 
me walk stood him up. When I left 
that day, he had been waiting back 
there in the corner for three hours, 
getting madder by the minute. Hey!” 
She gave him a tilted, quizzical look. 
“She was watching Murph before she 
started down that imaginary runway 
'to your booth. Is Murph in some kind 
of trouble? She complaining?” 

“Well, she doesn’t like him.” 
Abruptly Molly dropped out of 
character. “Leah Larkin! Do you 
strong, aggressive types really like 
those cooing^ biceps-patters?” Then 
she shrugged again. “Murpho is hard 
to like, but he isn’t as mean as he 
looks. He’s just better than average 
greedy.” 

Savill nodded, frowning. He had 
traced too many dead men back to 
somebody else’s greed. There was 
money to be made here selling cold 
drinks and hot food. But there was a 



great deal more money to be made 
from the sale of Old Alien artifacts, if 
you found good ones. He asked, “Ev- 
er found anything salable around 
here?” 

Molly looked surprised. “Here? 
What could there be in this spooky 
pile of plastic and Termite spit? Could 
you even tell me what the Bugs used 
this building for? Oh, we’ve had of- 
fers. This is a mint. Murph has even 
offered to buy me out. But it’s the 
business, not the building, that is 
valuable.” 

Qomething stirred faintly in Savill’s 
mind. It didn’t quite reach the 
surface but it prompted a question. 
“What kind of a price?” 

“To me? His kind of a price. What 
else? Murph will swindle anyone, any 
time. It’s a conditioned reflex. But I 
can handle him. I catch him trying 
to swindle me. I’ll clobber him good. 
Look, Hero. I have clients who are 
willing to talk about me. And stop 
fighting over women here or I’ll call 
a cop.” 

She touched his shoulder, smiled 
her in-character smile, and moved on. 
Suddenly he grinned. She could han- 
dle Murpho, for sure. She could be 
explosive. She was a Terran. And 
when she exploded, she picked up 
whatever was under her hand. He 
frowned at that. Until now he had 
thought it was amusing. 

His eyes followed her across the 
shadowy room and then he looked 
around at the room itself, trying to 
see it as it might have been before 
those unknown alien invaders had 
blasted the only slightly better known 
builders off the planet. Something of 



WHAT THE OLD ALIENS LEFT 



101 




big value here? Until recently it had 
seemed to him only Alien. Now, he 
recalled, even Molly had called it 
“spooky.” 

It was one of the few Old Alien 
surface installations still standing in 
the City. But it had been passed over 
for more promising prospects by the 
quick money S & S outfits like OMA. 
Dimly lit now — apparently a custom 
followed by tavern keepers since the 
mastodon oil lamp — the rectangular 
room looked as if it had been planned 
for some utilitarian purpose. But no 
one knew what. There were recesses 
along three walls, large enough to be 
used as booths. Hence the nickname 
that had stuck, Murpho’s Morgue, 
because of the slabs of some non- 
metallic material on the walls of each 
booth. The slabs were high enough to 
be used as benches. 

Murpho had kept them. He had 
cleared the rubble, roofed the shell, 
and cleaned the still undamaged walls 
and floor so that the murals and the 
oddly rectilinear floor pattern, re- 
peated in the booths, gleamed. He 
had installed self-contained servo 
tables in the center and had adapted 
what appeared to have been some 
kind of communications counter at 
one side for the tricky tubing of his 
bar console. With Murpho’s skill at 
synthesizing and blending, and with 
Molly Cato’s personality, the Morgue 
was an institution, a public house 
which was far more than a bar, and 
a welcome relief from the bleak deso- 
lation of the blast desert. 

But what, he wondered, could there 
be about this Old Alien shell valuable 
enough to motivate murder and its 
giggling bedmate, blackmail? His head 



was beginning to ache. He ignored it, 
knowing it meant only that his mind 
was skittering, caught in the ambival- 
ence of being told to work on a prob- 
lem which he wanted to solve but was 
fearful of the solution. A murder had 
to be uncovered quickly, if there had 
been one. But what if . 

H e thrust the building’s owners out 
of his mind and looked around 
at the building itself. For the past 
three months it had seemed unac- 
countably — there it was again — 
spooky. The Missing File. Which now 
had a new name, Mack Weymouth. 
Once, gossiping with Murpho at the 
bar, Savill had started abruptly to- 
ward the back corner booth, certain 
he had glimpsed Shorty Wills, who 
was a red-starred name on the Miss- 
ing File. Shorty had taken a case of 
negotiable claim deeds with him when 
he dropped out of sight. Another time 
it had been big Hank Wyatt. Hank, 
before he* disappeared, had been car- 
rying on a running feud with Murpho. 

There had been others who had 
come to mind here, unexpectedly. In 
a way it reminded him of the effect 
of those sneaky subliminal inserts 
some agencies had been caught slip- 
ping in behind the picture in a view- 
tank. A dirty trick as old as visual 
communication; inexplicably you 
found you knew the code call that 
would reach, by name, one of Har- 
riet’s Happy Hippies. He shrugged ir- 
ritably. But he frowned at the incom- 
prehensible wall murals and the odd 
tracery of faintly fluorescent floor 
decoration. What had those big brain- 
ed, wasp-waisted Isoptera used the 
place for? Was there some incompre- 



102 



IF 




hensible Termite gadget around, still 
flickering? 

He shrugged again and emptied his 
glass. Probably he recalled the miss- 
ing people here simply because they 
all had one thing in common. They 
were all regulars at Murpho’s Mor- 
gue. Which meant little. Who wasn’t? 

He got to his feet, but the problem 
stayed on his back. And he was let- 
ting himself be diverted. Whatever 
had been found here, if anything, 
represented only money. What count- 
ed was what had been done about it, 
because of it, and by whom. He 
hadn’t learned much from Molly that 
he hadn’t known. Murpho had tried 
to buy her out. That was new. And 
Weymouth, the missing man, had 
been working here with Murpho. Also 
new. Murph was hog greedy, out for 
a fast credit. But everybody knew 
that. Weymouth could have been a 
partner. Men had been killed because 
their partners hadn’t wanted to share 
the loot. And killers innumerable had 
been blackmailed out of their loot. 
But dammit, Molly Cato wouldn’t . 

His head was aching when he went 
home. He slept little. 

Ill 

H is temples still throbbed faintly 
next day when he pushed in 
through the Chief’s privacy screen. 
Cayhill was glowering, but that was 
no cause for alarm. Savill had learn- 
ed the Chief just wouldn’t admit he 
needed lens surgery. Cayhill couldn’t 
see clearly much beyond the width of 
his desk. Lowering his head and glow- 
ering up past bunched eyebrows gave 
him a narrow field of extended vision. 



But the glacial eyes glittering ui^er 
snowy hair and eyebrows were dis- 
concerting to many. Cayhill heirf up 
the snooper. “So you confiscated an 
illegal gadget. Commendable. What if 
he hadn’t had it?” 

That, Savill thought warily, was a 
point to consider. Outside the boun- 
dary of an undemocratic Work Pro- 
ject, search of the person was illegal. 
A man’s hip pocket was his castle, in- 
violate. Even here, it might be an 
open question. 

Hurriedly he asked, “Have you 
projected it?” 

“Yes. And talked with your Miss 
Larkin. The crystal shows you smirk- 
ing like a cadet at a woman who is 
not all that good looking.” 

“If I had a smirk, she soon wiped 
it off.” 

“True. But you swallowed the story 
whole, then and there. Look, I have 
to walk a bigh, tight wire where 
OMA is concerned. And when she 
cued you in with those appealing 
black eyes, you didn’t even try to be 
tactful. You girded your loins, mount- 
ed your stallion, waved your sabre 
and yelled, ‘Cha-a-a-rge!’ Well, I was 
young once. But it openly put that 
girl under full Security protection, 
with all that implies. OMA is going 
to come charging back.” 

“I was there. I thought it was nec- 
essary.” 

Cayhill sighed. “I’m not saying it 
wasn’t. Anyway, it’s done. But han- 
dling OMA is my department. Let’s 
get to your job. Is either Murpho or 
Molly capable of premeditated mur- 
der? For gain? Plus the gruesome lit- 
tle chore of disposing of a body? And 
where is the body?” 



WHAT THE OLD ALIENS LEFT 



.103 




Savill suppressed a smile. The 
Chief was getting as bad as Molly. He 
tried to answer all the questions at 
once. “I think not.” 

Cayhill squinted, nodding. “So 
does the computer. But it doesn’t 
have much data on Miss Larkin ex- 
cept what you fed into it last night 
before you started brawling. And the 
snooper. Look. Her guy is missing, 
but he said no farewells. Is she a re- 
jected plaything, angry, frustrated, 
hallucinating? I know one frustrated 
woman who is crowding critical mass. 
Is this one psycho?” 

Savill frowned, but Cayhill’s glacier 
eyes pulled him back to the subject. 
“No. I believe she told the truth.” 
Cayhill rubbed his white thatch 
and glared. “You and the computer! 
It also says that every person on the 
Missing List, to which we have now 
added Weymouth, was last seen either 
in or near the Morgue. So?” 

“So it has to be something we 
haven’t thought of.” 

C ayhill leaned forward, scowling 
heavily. “Well, we better think 
of it. Soon. We know what Leah Lar- 
kin says. Damned soon we’ll know 
what OMA says. And whether for the 
reasons she gives or from righteous 
indignation, OMA is going to scream 
— defamation of the corporate image, 
bias, incompetency, assault by a Se- 
curityman, brutality, the whole list. 
OMA has the ear of the Inspector 
General. I don’t say he is biased, but 
some of the ambitious Light Colonels 
who flit around this sector like to 
make a favorable impression on in- 
fluential people. And at the top, 
OMA has influence. All right. Go see 



Murpho. Feed it to the computer 
again, so I can have it as you go 
along if I need it. And don’t go twist- 
ing his arm, hear? There are regula- 
tions against it.” 

Savill was almost to the screen 
when Cayhill called his name. The 
Old Man’s eyes seemed to have lost 
some of their glacial quality. “There’s 
always the chance this may not turn 
out to be ‘something we haven’t 
thought of.’ You want me to take this 
one?” 

Savill felt his face getting stiff 
again. “I’m not trying to make Col- 
onel.” 

Cayhill continued his stare. Then 
gruffly he came as close to an apol- 
ogy as Savill had ever heard. “I 
shouldn’t have asked. Get going.” 

It wasn’t far to the Morgue, and 
Savill Liked to walk the City in day- 
light. You either suffered or enjoyed 
the twin suns, depending on your 
state of mind. He liked hot, dry 
weather. That millennium-old blasting 
had not glassed over completely. 
Traces remained of narrow, twisting 
“streets.” They looked more like out- 
sized termite runs than walkways. Oc- 
casionally one would dip under- 
ground. It was similar in other lightly 
blasted areas. You wondered how the 
Bugs found their way or moved any- 
thing bulky. But they had once had 
a planet-wide mining and industrial 
complex going here. The very im- 
mensity of this partly natural but 
mostly blast desert accounted for so 
many of these R & D people getting 
lost or stranded. But, until recently, 
they had always been found. He was 
scowling thoughtfully when he enter- 
ed the now nearly empty Morgue.

IF 




It was too early for Molly, but 
MurphO met him with the grimace he 
thought was a smile. The smile van- 
ished when Mack Weymouth’s name 
came up. Murpho spread his pudgy 
hands, and his gesture could have 
been called a shrug. “Cliff, I just 
don’t know. Sure, Mack spent some 
free time here. He helped me make 
some improvements in the synthesizer 
and the flow systems to the booths. 
But he hasn’t been around lately.” 
Savin looked at the intricate bar 
console. “Is that what you were work- 
ing on? Murph, what was under that 
old counter you’re using?” 

“Nothing much. Traces of wiring. 
Some old Termite tubing. Plugged or 
disintegrated. Nothing I could use.” 
“Have you ever really gone over 
the place? The original survey show- 
ed something solid, apparently shield- 
ed, down deep.” 

M urpho’s round torso again rip- 
pled with that pseudo-shrug. 
“The whole planet has patches of 
buried shielding scattered around. 
Cliff. What they’ve opened hasn’t 
made any sense, except maybe to a 
Termite. Why wreck a building to 
dig up a chunk of plastic filled with 
crystals? The R & D boys have car- 
tons of the stuff. I wanted the build- 
ing, to open a saloon. Cliff, what are 
you getting at? What do you want?” 
Savill relaxed against the bar. 
“Missing people, Murph. Weymouth, 
sure. But there’s also Shorty Wills, 
and that loud-mouth Hyatt, and three 
or four others. Vanished. All Mor- 
gue regulars. Do you know anything 
about them?” 

Murpho’s broad face remained 



bland but his eyes flicked toward the 
corner of the room. Savill looked. 
There was nothing there — the same 
Alien flooring, a special chair, out- 
size to accommodate Murpho’s round 
bulk, an empty out-of-service booth, 
the door to Murpho’s quarters. Savill 
looked back at Murpho. 

“Do you?” 

“Cliff, people come and go. I don’t 
pay much attention.” 

“You’re going to have to start, 
Murph. The story we get isn’t pretty. 
To begin with, has OMA made an 
offer to buy this^ place?” 

Murpho came to his feet. His 
broad, bland face was incapable of 
much expression but there was some- 
thing that could have been fear in 
his eyes. “You’ve been listening to 
that girl! She’s out of her mind! There 
hasn’t been any murder. Ask OMA! 
Ask Kotch!” 

“I’m going to, Murph. And you 
know more about it than you’re ad- 
mitting. Miss Larkin talked only to 
me and the Chief. Where did you 
learn about it? Kotch? Is Kotch trying 
to squeeze you out of this place? 
Look, man, if you’re in a jam, the 
place to come is to me or to Cayhill!” 
“You get out of here. Cliff! That 
woman is off her beam and just try- 
ing to make trouble. And so are you! 
Just because Molly won’t . .” 

Murpho backed away when he 
found Savill was towering over him. 
Savill was following Murpho’s retreat 
when the V & A unit in his pocket 
hissed insistently. He snapped, “Chief, 
I’m busy! Check the computer!” 

An unmodulated voder unit inton- 
ed, “This is the computer. Chief 
Cayhill is being informed of your 



WHAT THE OLD ALIENS LEFT 



105 




work up to now. Take a priority 
message. Report to Chief Cayhill im- 
mediately. End of message.” 

Savin scowled. For a routine as- 
signment, or chewing out, Cayhill 
would have bellowed for action him- 
self. This was formal and ominous. 
The toneless voice repeated, ‘Take a 
priority . .” He vented his irritation 
even though he knew it was wasted. 
“Coming!” 

IV 

H e was wary when he pushed 
through the shimmering privacy 
screen and sized up the visitors. 
Kotch, of course, with a mark on his 
neck and his licorice eyes still smol- 
dering. Beside him sat a typical Ter- 
ran tycoon, well dressed in a suit of 
thernwcloth which apparently had 
shorted out. The round, button-eyed 
face was pink and hot. The third 
visitor was several thousand light- 
years distant, but very much in evi- 
dence. The subspace comscreen show- 
ed the image of a cold, bony face and 
most of the spit-and-polish tunic of a 
Project Service uniform. The screen 
carried the code identification of one 
of the Inspector General’s cruisers. 
Deputy! OMA had reacted fast! And 
with muscle. 

The Chief named them. Pink Face 
was OMA’s Mr. Willits. Stone Face, 
sure enough, was a Colonel Holt, en- 
route to Otho. Savill felt his stomach 
muscles squeeze, few the Chiefs voice 
had an unfamiliar, I-never-saw-this- 
guy-before-in-my-life tone. 

“Sergeant Mr. Willits formally 
charges that your irresponsible ac- 
tions, during and after an illegal 



search of Mr. Kptch’s person, have 
caused the spread of a malicious, 
slanderous story, completely false, 
and originating with an unbalanced, 
hysterical ex-employee of his. Miss 
Leah Larkin.” 

So. The Old Man was going for- 
mal. 

“Miss Larkin’s story has been 
checked by the computer’s psycho- 
graph unit.” 

Willits spoke up blandly. “It proves 
only that she believes what she says. 
She overheard a part, a fragment, of 
a conversation. She misinterpreted 
what she heard. Her actions may be 
understandable, considering her near 
hysterical state of mind. Her contract 
was up for review, and I also assume 
she was — ah — abandoned by Mr. 
Weymouth.” 

Savill turned to Cayhill. “Have you 
asked him just where Mack Wey- 
mouth is?” 

Expressionless, Cayhill nodded. 
“Out on a confidential field job.” 

“Then why this awesome show of 
force? Let’s get him in here. One 
word, just the sight of him, blows this 
whole thing . .” 

Cayhill interrupted sharply. “That’s 
all, Sergeant. I’ll handle it. You are 
going out on another assignment.” 

After an incredulous ^What?** Sa- 
vill found astonishment had silenced 
him. Why the spineless old . he 
was backing away! He was letting 

them Anger made his voice rasp. 

“Reassigned by whom? Otho Mining 
Associates? When I left this office an 
hour ago I thought you were worried 
about me! Maybe you were, at that. 
Who is Security here? I want to know 
whom to hand my . .” 



106 



IF 




A bellow made the visitors wince 
and drowned out the rest of his 
words. The Old Man’s voice rumbled. 
“I am Security here, Sergeant, and 
don’t you forget it! The Dispatcher 
has your orders. Dismissed!” 

Blindly Savill clamped his jaw and 
came to attention. All right, you 
spineless old goat. But I’ve had it! He 
met Cayhill’s enigmatic glare, ignored 
the smug smirks from Willits and 
Kotch, and met the cold stare from 
the listening I. G. Colonel on the 
screen. He saluted the screen, making 
the meticulously correct gesture in- 
clude the furiously glowering Cayhill, 
and then pushed blindly out through 
the privacy screen. His hands had al- 
most stopped shaking by the time he 
confronted the Dispatcher. 

That worthy grinned when Savill 
picked up the mike of a voicewriter. 
“Don’t record your troubles for me, 
Sergeant. I got troubles of my own. 
I don’t borrow any. Look, why can’t 
you be realistic about these . .” 

He stopped when Savill growled 
and made a fist. But that, Savill 
thought, was stupid. This guy wasn’t 
a cop, by Savill’s standards, but he 
had been Security trained. His re- 
flexes would never let a punch land. 

The Dispatcher grinned again. “So 
Cayhill burned you down. Before wit- 
nesses. So what? That I. G. Colonel 
who is on his way here wanted to fire 
you out of hand. So why don’t you 
read your orders?” 

Savjll took the flimsy. After all, he 
had never known the Old Man to do 
anything without a reason. And pres- 
ently he forgot the Dispatcher. The 
Chief was sending him out to Joe 
Blough’s claim — Joey Blow, they 



called him — who was currently in 
debt, right up to his jug ears, to Otho 
Mining Associates. Joey had found 
and partially reactivated an automat- 
ed Termite mine. But he had borrow- 
ed to the hilt from OMA for a new 
ore lift. 

Savill recalled that when Joey had 
pushed his bread-boarded control 
switches, his alien ore carriers had 
started working like mad, but they 
carefully avoided his new ore lift 
platform. With singleminded insist- 
ence, they had started dumping ore 
at the end of a dead-end tunnel. Joey 
had yelled and had even stood in their 
way. They had sidled around him, 
when the end of the tunnel was full, 
the whole mine had hiccoughed and 
shut down. At the Morgue, Joey had 
cursed picturesquely at stupid Termite 
robots which insisted on doing their 
own thinking. 

Savill moved to the computer in- 
put. When he finished, he was frown- 
ing thoughtfully. The Chief was kick- 
ing him in the teeth in a way sure as 
hell calculated to please and quiet 
OMA. But he was being sent to the 
one place where OMA was known to 
be showing an active interest in an 
independent claim. Moreover, by 
OMA standards, a claim which was 
of dubious value. Registration and 
Records said OMA had started fore- 
closure on Joey. 

W hy? OMA already owned far 
better mines. They didn’t need 
Joey’s. And if you believed the Larkin 
story, which he did, OMA was also 
pressing Murpho the hard way — by 
blackmail — to sell them the Morgue. 
OMA needed a saloon like he needed 



WHAT THE OLD ALIENS LEFT 



107 




a Map Board man to tell him how to 
do his job. Suddenly he felt better, so 
much so that he let the Dispatcher 
get away with it when the man crack- 
ed, “See? I not only have to provide 
perambulators for you field guys, I 
have to do your thinking for you. I 
told you to read those orders.” 

Savill grimaced. “Nuts! You read 
’em and saw only words. Which 
floater?” 

“The single seater. It’s program- 
med.” 

Slamming the floater door and set- 
tling back into its single seat, he tried 
to relax. He was too wound up to 
sleep. This could be coincidence. The 
Old Man might be just getting him 
out of the way so the I. G. office and 
OMA could be placated. But that 
wasn’t like him. Savill tried, with 
eventual success, to appreciate the 
glittering reds, grays and whites of 
the blast desert as the floater homed 
through the hours at safe, computer- 
governed speeds. 

Joey seemed surprised, but glad to 
see him. “Any other Morgue bench 
warmer would have remembered to 
bring some cold brew. How’s Molly?” 
Joey was another of that unofficial, 
unorganized group, the Molly watch- 
ers. But after food and a lot of ram- 
bling talk, Joey’s puzzlement showed 
through. 

“What the hell, Cliff? I don’t need 
a Securityman. Johnny Hart and I 
can settle our boundary dispute. My 
new shaft, if I can finance it, will 
have to start from his side of the 
line. But we won’t need a referee.” 

“If you can finance it? Won’t 
OMA help?” 

“Help? The greedy bastards are 



pushing me to sell. At their price. Or 
foreclosure. And there isn’t a hell #f 
a lot of difference. Kotch has been 
out here, twisting my arm. And an- 
other guy. I chased them to hell out.” 
“Who was the other one?” 

Joey snorted disgust. “Fluidics 
man, name of Weymouth. I enjoyed 
throwing him out, the bad tempered 
ape. He wanted to argue.” 

Suddenly alert, Savill asked quick- 
ly, “When, Joey?” 

“Three months ago. They haven’t 
been back, but GMA served papers.” 
Savill thought, three months! So 
Willits and Kotch had lied. Maybe. 
They could have sent him elsewhere 
later. “What was Weymouth up to?” 
Joey pointed to a stud on the panel. 
“Checking this stuff. It’s dead. I could 
dope out everything else, but I never 
have figured what the Bugs used the 
fluidics for. The tubing goes down 
toward a shielded section, deep. Some 
of that section is boxed in behind 
stuff a neutron would have to crawl 
through. Look. Weymouth filled part 
of the system before I found him.” 
Joey punched the stud. “See? 
Down there, the ore pile those moron 
ore carriers made. That border glows 
and then winks off. Whatever it is, it 
starts and then some kind of fail-safe 
takes hold. Must have been some kind 
of scale, or grader, analysis, maybe. 
But the carriers won’t work past it. 
I’ll have to sink my new shaft there 
and . .” 

J oey’s voice faded as Savill began 
moving away, down the tube-lit 
tunnel. The alien machines were lin- 
ed in a precise row, facing back, as 
if they had made ready for another 



108 



IF 




trip before shutting themselves off. 
They reminded him of a row of Ter- 
ran road building robots, but they 
were anything but that primitive. 
They seemed poised, waiting for 
something. 

With tantalizing expectancy, Savill 
found he was waiting, too. For what? 
His head was aching again, but it 
wasn’t telling him anything. He lean- 
ed against the last carrier and let his 
eyes wander. Abruptly his expectancy 
turned to elation. The floor! It had 
the same pattern on the edges as the 
floor at the Morgue. With an effort 
he kept his voice down. “Joey. Try 
it again.” 

There was no sound. There was the 
faint beginning of a bluish fluores- 
cence in the inlay of the border pat- 
tern. But the next instant he found he 
had jumped back a full step, his 
nerves tingling. Reflex had jerked his 
hand back as if he had touched a 
snake. The carrier had moved! 

Not much. It couldn’t have been 
seen. It had been more a pulse, a 
gathering of forces, as if the big robot 
had been getting poised to move. 
Quickly he called, “Again, JoeyP 
This time his touch was light, expec- 
tant. In spite of himself he jumped 
again. But now he was certain. The 
big machine had completed a cycle, 
gone as far as it could. And now it 
was immobilized, trapped between 
conflicting signals: Work! Hold! Go! 
No Go! 

With agonized clarity he found he 
was trapped by the same conflict. He 
knew, now, where the bodies were. 
But that brought him back to Mur- 
pho’s Morgue, to Murpho — and to 
Molly Cato. 



His mind spun away, reaching for 
irrevelent distractions. Why hadn’t 
R & D spotted it? It stood out now 
like the hidden face in the psycholo- 
gist’s trick picture. It explained the 
haphazard aimlessness of this whole 
scattered Isopteran planetary com- 
plex. But of course at least one of 
OMA’s R & D people had seen it. 

And so had Murpho. So, perhaps, 
had Molly Cato. And somebody was 
using it as a weapon — more than a 
weapon — in a way that was horri- 
fying. He found he was running, then, 
punching the Chiefs V & A comcode 
as he ran. 

V 

H e ignored Joey’s questions and 
signaled Emergency. That 
brought him the hum code of the 
City Map Room, and the Dispatcher’s 
needling voice. “Relax, Savill. We’re 
guarding your ward. Just now she’s 
headed for the Morgue . .” 
“Where’s the Chief?” 

“He’s taking no calls.” 
“Goddamnit where is he?” 

The Dispatcher’s voice froze. “He’s 
at the MOTgue and he ordered no 
calls. So 1 sure as bell won’t have him 
paged for you.” 

This book-bound idiot would want 
it in writing. And when he got it, he 
would come unstuck. Savill lowered 
his voice. “All ri^t. All right. Have 
the computer route my floater home. 
Fast. I have to come in.” 

“I’ll do no such thing! The Chief 
ordered you out there. That’s on the 
Day Book. You try to move that 
floater without his clearance, and I’ll 
deactivate the driv^!” 



WHAT THE OLD ALIENS LEFT 



109 




Cursing all book-bound desk men, 
he let the V & A unit snap off and 
called, “Phone, Joey?” Joey moved 
aside, and in what seemed an hour 
Molly Cato’s handsome, tilt-eyed face 
filled the screen. Her in-character 
smile faded abruptly. 

“OhI You! I’d think you’d be 
ashamed to . Never mind. I’ll call 
her.” 

“Molly, what are you talking 
about? Never mind! Get me Cayhill!” 
“I’m talking about your friend with 
the follow-me walk! You might as 
well talk to her because the Chief is 
busy! Is he busy!” 

Her voice was throaty with smol- 
dering, contemptuous anger. He felt 
himself frowning. Molly always play- 
ed a part. But she couldn’t be this 
good an actress. This had come as a 
surprise to her. “Molly, call him!” 
“Have you found the body? Stran- 
gled with one of my stockings? Look, 
he has Murph and Kotch and me 
back there and he’s about ready to 
start using his rubber hose on us. And 
now he’s waving me back. He isn’t 
about to come to the phone. Can’t 
that mean little mind of yours . .” 
“Molly, stop it! Get them out of 
there! I know what happened to Wey- 
mouth, and all the rest of those peo- 
ple who are missing. Don’t you?” 
“You gibbering cretin, how could 
7 know?” 

He had been watching the play of 
emotion in her face. She didn*i know! 
You can’t prove a negative, but you 
can know it! He lowered his voice. 

“Molly, screen the phone. I don’t 
want anyone to hear this. And believe 
me, I was never more serious and I 
was never more scared. Does he have 



you in that out-of-service booth back 
there in the corner?” 

She had moved in close to the near- 
ly silenced phone, so that her face 
seemed only inches from his own. 
When she nodded he found that, al- 
though he had expected it, he had 
to make a second try before the 
words came out. “Molly, that booth 
back there is an Old Alien matter 
transmitter. That’s what that whole 
building was — a Termite personnel 
transportation center. And that cor- 
ner booth is working!** 

I t took her five seconds. Her mouth 
formed a startled “O,” and her 
eyes widened. She glanced quickly 
over her shoulder and then back, 
waiting. 

“Don’t go back inside that thing. 
Cayhill may argue and say he’ll call 
me later. So tell him, if you have to. 
And when they’re out, help him keep 
people away from there. I don’t know 
what activates it, but it has to be 
something at the bar. So smile and 
keep them away. No touch. Like 
you do me.” 

Her tilted eyes widened, and he saw 
them move slightly as if they were 
scanning his image in the screen. She 
smiled faintly. “Sergeant, you are 
probably a smart cop. It appears you 
are. But in some ways you are just 
plain stupid!” She glanced over her 
shoulder again. “Kotch is out, but 
Murpho and Cayhill are still sitting 
there. I’ll get him. Wait.” 

She moved away, and the phone 
hummed, the visual pickup taking in 
a segment of the thin crowd at the 
tables in the shadowy background. 
He could make out one end of the 



no 



IF 




bar. The privacy hum continued. 
Wait, she had said. But it shouldn’t 
take this long . Abruptly his pulse 
started pounding. Then he heard a 
voice, shouting. It was his own. He 
lunged toward the screen as if it were 
a window it was possible to go 
through. The back of a man’s head, a 
shoulder and an arm, had appeared 
in one corner of the screen. He heard 
himself raging, and he didn’t realize 
he was senselessly beating his fist on 
the table until he felt Joey Blough’s 
hand grip his arm and heard Joey’s 
tight, steady voice saying, “Easy, 
Cliff. Easy. There was nothing we 
could do.” 

So Joey, too, had seen the arm 
reach in toward the backbar, toward 
something that was out of sight, be- 
low the range of the phone’s visual 
pickup, and then stealthly withdraw. 
And now there was nothing either of 
them could do but wait. 

And wait. Presently Savill sank 
weakly into a chair Joey pushed up 
behind him. Then they both waited, 
occasionally glancing at each other. 
After a time they stopped doing even 
that. They could no longer meet each 
other’s eyes. The phone hummed on 
and on, like the automatic Dead- 
Ship signal from a liner that has been 
opened to space. 

After an immeasurable time Savill 
looked up. “I have to get in there.” 

“What’s keeping you?” 

“If I don’t tell that Dispatcher, 
he’ll kill the floater the minute I 
touch it. If I do tell him, they’ll 
swarm all over that place, punching 
and prodding. Maybe nothing can be 
done, but I want to talk to Kotch 
first. It had to be Kotch.” 



J oey got up and reached for a tool 
kit. “I’m next in line, remember. 
Come on. I’ll help you compound a 
felony. That drive should be like a 
transistor radio compared with the 
stuff I’ve been bread-boarding around 
here.” 

In a little over twenty minutes, 
Joey looked up from the drive hous- 
ing they had torched open. “You’ll 
get some radiation. Not enough to 
hurt. Technically we’ve swiped a po- 
lice floater, and it’ll sure never be 
the same again. She’ll only skim, now. 
But fast. Watch yourself, going in.” 
Savill never could recall much 
about that twisting, skimming, flood- 
lit ride. But he made the drive last 
long enough so it didn’t start to flare 
until he had walked away from it in 
front of the OMA building. There 
were quick words, ending with a 
ruthlessly broken arm, when the pri- 
vate guard at the door tried to stop 
him. He felt no remorse, only a cold 
realization that the ape in his skull 
had started screeching and gibbering 
just inside the mouth of its cave. 
When he strode into Willits’ office, 
he found Willits and Kotch in a con- 
ference, via the comscreen, with Col- 
onel Holt. 

Holt’s image was clearer now. The 
cruiser was a good many light-years 
nearer. Savill ignored the startled pro- 
tests and walked directly to Kotch. 
“I want some answers, Kotch.” 
Kotch’s lips grimaced, and his eyes 
flicked toward the screen. He kept 
his voice down, barely audible. “Out, 
Savill! You’re out of your depth here. 
What you think you know and what 
you can prove are entirely different.” 
Savill hit him and then stepped 



V/HAT THE OLD ALIENS LEFT 



ni 




around the overturned chair. He 
heard some squealing. That was Will- 
its, yelling for help. The shocked, 
outraged roar must be the comscreen, 
somebody thundering that Savill was 
under arrest, was discharged, was to 
be tried for felonious assault. After 
a while the thundering died out. Then 
he could hear the screaming. And 
soon, between screams, some talk. 
And presently Savill thought dully 
that Kotch was a fortunate man. He 
had started talking just as the gib- 
bering ape was about to break free. 

Savill turned then to the comscreen 
and the silently staring Holt. “You do 
what you damned please about me, 
Colonel. But you heard him. I’d say 
it was your responsibility to see he 
doesn’t get off planet. The Map 
Board man will take your orders.” 
When he entered the now nearly 
empty Morgue, he glanced at the 
clock over the W. It read 0102 of a 
new day. Three hours I The thin 
crowd had moved to the self-serving 
tables in the center of the shadowy 
room, and the few who questioned 
him stayed in their seats when he mo- 
tioned them back. People were used 
to doing as they pleased here. He 
walked back and checked the booth. 
Its emptiness seemed to mock him. 

T hen he walked to the phone, try- 
ing to get the same view he had 
had before when Kotch’s hand had 
reached toward the end of the bar 
and then had dropped down, out of 
the screen’s image. And he found the 
lever Kotch had described. It was 
part of the system that led into the 
beer storage section, Murpho’s pri- 
vate stock of pilsener. 



He looked again at the empty 
booth. Few, if any, could even see it 
from out on the floor. He was sweat- 
ing, and his hands felt cold. He had 
a fleeting thought that he might just 
make this worse. But how? It was 
already about as bad as it could get. 
He shifted the lever. The floor pat- 
tern in the booth glowed faintly. Of 
course. It was already empty. He 
looked down at the lever, and the 
connected stubs of old and new tub- 
ing radiating around its base. There 
was a setting on the other side of the 
circle, unworn, bearing a bubble of 
dried paint. His hands were damp, 
even shaking slightly, and it took 
force to jam the lever into place. He 
heard a faint hiss of flowing liquid. 
And then with relief that made his 
knees crumple, he heard Chief Cay- 
hill’s bellowing voice, rumbling and 

mad. “Savill! I ordered you Get 

moving! And close that screen!” 

His pulse pounding, he found him- 
self standing rigid, staring at the 
booth. Murpho and Cayhill were sit- 
ting on the benches, and Molly was 
standing barely inside the faintly puls- 
ing floor pattern, her mouth open 
with surprise. 

“Tell him? I didn’t have time I 
Where were you calling from? I had 
to pound on his shoulder even to get 
him to listen, and then he looked up 
past me and started yelling at you!” 

“Never mind! Out of that thing! 
All of you!” 

Molly’s face changed from grow- 
ing understanding to fear, and she 
moved quickly to one side. Murpho, 
eyes bulging and his face fish-belly 
white, needed no urging. He darted 
out, brushing past Molly. Cayhill rose

slowly and stamped forward, a storm 
on his face. But both he and Savill 
turned when they heard a gasp from 
Molly. Her voice was almost shrill. 
“Look It’s Wills! Shorty WiUs!” 

Loddng trapped and scared, Wills 
was standing in front of the booth. 
He was holding a briefcase as if it 
had suddenly started to tick. The 
Chiefs face lit up, and his voice ex- 
ploded. “Hah! Where the hell did 
you come from?” His hand closed on 
the briefcase, and he marched the lit- 
tle messenger off to the side. “Savill, 
I’ll talk to you later. You stay right 
here!” 

Savill realized it figured. Shorty 
was a man they had wanted for a 
long time. The briefcase was worth 
half a million. But he was still just 
reacting, not thinking, until he heard 
Hank Wyatt’s bass voice. Hank was 
sitting at a table, with an empty glass 
in front of him! And he was grum- 
bling, “Look, Fishface. Are you ag- 
ing that beer?” 

Savill moved quickly to the booth. 
“Out, Hank! Drag that table with 
you!” 

“Huh? So old Fishface has police 
protection now! He’ll need . .” 

“Move, Hank! And shut up!” 

Hank scowled, but he moved. Mol- 
ly gripped Savill’s arm. “Cliff! Was 
I . ?” 

Savill nodded. “See the time? You 
were in there three hours!” 

She caught her breath. “But whafs 
happening now?” 

“1 think it is the only operative 
unit. So it was just holding. God 
knows how. A pattern in a memory 
bank down behind all that shielding, 

I suppose. It held, and then kept try- 



ing to reverse itself. That’s why I kept 
seeing spooks. Flickers, subliminal.” 
Then he waved an arm. “That’s good. 
Hank. Go get a drink at a table. And 
keep your mouth shut.” 

VI 

S avill watched expectantly, and as 
the grumbling Wyatt turned away, 
a stranger appeared on the bench in 
the booth. No furniture this time; he 
was just sitting there. Savill waved 
him out. Then another, who took one 
look at Savill’s Security tunic and 
scuttled for the exit. Another! Savill 
held his breath. One more! That was 
it! The Missing File! But there should 
be still another, the guy who had 
never been in the File at all. Molly 
gasped again. “There! It’s Wey- 
mouth!” 

It was. But the scowling Weymouth 
didn’t even glance in their direction. 
Muttering, and looking at his watch, 
he headed toward the shadowy table 
area. 

Savill felt the tension fall away, 
leaving him weak and lightheaded. He 
put an arm aroimd Molly. “That’s it, 
MoUy-OI Like a FILO inventory; 
First In — Last Out! You’re rich. 
They’ll bid big. Millions!” 

Too late he realized it wasn’t the 
best moment for the reminder. Molly 
wheeled toward the pasty-faced Mur- 
pho. “So! That’s why you wanted to 
buy me out. Megacredits and you of- 
fer me tokens!” 

Murpho was gasping like a catfish 
on a grassy bank. Savill pulled Molly 
back. “Easy. Murph may be in real 
trouble. A murder charge.” 

Muipho croaked, “No, Cliff! I 
swear it! I didn’t know. Kotch must 



WHAT THE OLD ALIENS LEFT 



113 




have. He didn’t like it when the 
Chief picked that booth for his talk 
with us. And he got out the minute 
Molly left to get the phone.” 

“Had he tried to blackmail you? 
Force a sale?” 

“Yes. He threatened to bring a 
murder charge unless I bought Molly 
out and sold to him. But he didn’t 
tell me how Weymouth had been kill- 
ed .. Only that he could prove I had 
done it!” 

Molly’s eyes were still blazing. 
“You lying old bullhead! You 
thought you could squirm out of it 
somehow and get all this for your- 
self. I know you!” 

“No! Cliff, I didn’t know what had 
happened to any of them. It wasn’t 
until Shorty Wills failed to come out 
that I realized that — that every time 
I drew a glass of pilsener whoever 
was sitting in booth nine disappear- 
ed!” 

It was the end of a long, hard day. 
Afterward Savill figured he must have 
started giggling about then. Anyway, 
it didn’t occur to him to stop Molly 
when he saw she was groping blindly 
while her tilted eyes blazed at Mur- 
pho. He saw her arm jerk, and too 
late he saw she was gripping a section 
of plastic hose. Then a cold spray — 
good Terran pilsener, he learned later 
— hit him in the face. 

H e pawed helplessly at his eyes, 
and he heard Murpho’s protests. 
There was a wavering glimpse of 
Murpho’s Roc-egg figure backing 
away. There was even Hank Wyatt’s 
rumbling bass, yelling gleefully, 
“Whack ’im, MoUy!” Then Savill 
found he was laughing too, doubled 



over, with tears and beer in his eyes. 
And too late he sensed that Murpho 
was backing toward the booth. Mur- 
pho bounced off the misplaced table, 
which had no business being there, 
and fell sprawling. 

Savill slapped blindly at the switch 
of the privacy screen. But that was 
all he could do. And as the screen 
was going opaque he saw the glowing 
floor pattern wink out — in an empty 
booth. Murpho was gone. And with 
a final, gurgling sigh the tube system 
hissed empty too. 

The next minutes were always a 
little blurred. Molly rushed to him, 
her eyes wide and horrified. “Cliff! 
I didn’t mean to do that!” He put an 
arm around her. But then to his 
astonishment her face took on an an- 
gry set and her tilted eyes widened. 
She jerked away. “Well! Your walk- 
ing doll!” 

He felt his jaw go slack and hands 
grip his arm. Miss Larkin’s eager 
voice cried, “Where is he? I saw 
him!” 

The best Savill could do was point. 
Mack Weymouth was striding to- 
ward them, pushing through the now 
closing-in crowd. Weymouth’s angry 
eyes shifted from Savill to Miss Lar- 
kin. “Where the hell have you been? 
I wait three hours and come out to 
find you hanging to this guy . 
where you been?” 

“Mack! Mr. Savill can explain . .” 
“Maybe he better. You show up 
three hours late, wearing a different 
dress, a different hairdo, and looking 
like you needed a night’s sleep. Just 
how did you spend the afternoon?” 
Savill never did figure what hap- 
pened to his vaunted Security-trained 



114 



IF 




reflexes. All he could recall was that 
after a fair-sized nova stopped flar- 
ing around his head he looked up 
from the floor and saw their backs, 
moving away, and faintly he heard 
her voice, “But Mack! I can explain!” 

Then the Chief went, “Hummm!” 
and Savill climbed wearily to his 
feet. Cayhill was stuffing a pair of 
old fashioned spectacles into his tunic 
pocket. Savill felt his jaw go slack 
again, but tightened it quickly. 

“How long have you been wearing 
those?” 

“Hummm! Long enough to see 
what was happening over here after 
Shorty turned out to be confused 
about the date. So that’s why Joey’s 
mine suddenly became worth OMA’s 
while to steal! Same kind of thingum- 
my out there?” 

Savill nodded tiredly. “His is a big 
one. For ore transport.” Suddenly 
Savill felt weak and weary. His jaw 
hurt. His lip was puffed. And one 
eye was painfully swelling shut. 
Damned old goat! Going to investi- 
gate personally and look where he 
wound up! The old fraud piled on 
the pressure, forced you to tWnk over 
your head and find answers from a 
thousand years back and then just 
stood there, rocking back and forth 
on his flat feet and going “Hummm!” 

T he Chief rocked back and forth 
and said, “Hummm! I thought 
you would come up with something, 
if you got good and mad and were 
pushed a little. So it was something 
we hadn’t thought of.” 

Savin wished there were some place 
to sit down. “There are several hours 
you haven’t been filled in on yet.” 



“Oh, no. I’ve been talking to the 
Map Board man. Holt ordered Kotch 
and Willits held. But we’re just get- 
ting this investigation well started 
now. You come up with some of the 
damnedest side effects. I send you 
out to find me a body and a suspect 
and you turn up a whole room full 
of bodies that have to be rounded up 
and brought back in to testify. Well, 
I’ll take care of that. But we’ll need 
Molly’s victim, too. You’ll stay on 
duty here. Private, until the Techs 
wake that thing up again.” 

It slipped past Savill, until Molly’s 
voice made him jump. “Private!” 
Cayhill bellowed back. “Yes, Pri- 
vate! And don’t take it out on me! 
He’s not only insubordinate, he ruin- 
ed a police vehicle, used illegal meth- 
ods to get information from a citizen, 
and furthermore . .” 

“You . ungrateful old . he 
brought you back, don’t forget!”^ 
Savill told himself he was just let- 
ting his jaw go slack again because 
it was aching so. But Cayhill’s griz- 
zled face had assumed an expression 
he had never seen. The face was smil- 
ing! And the voice was gentle! “No, 
Molly. I haven’t forgotten. I never 
will.” 

But then the bellow resumed, full 
volume. “And furthermore, as I was 
trying to say when you butted in, he 
could have stopped you. You were 
within arms reach, as you frequently 
are, I notice, except when you go 
into a huff about something. That 
was rank incompetence. So he’s bust- 
ed to Private and he’s staying right 
here to keep you under house arrest 
and wait for the Techs to get your 
victim back!” 



116 



IP 




Savin frowned, because Molly 
didn’t look in the least like a woman 
who had just been arrested. She look- 
ed about twelve years old. Even after 
that fleeting look faded, her lower lip 
stayed pushed out. She glared at Cay- 
hill. 

“I don’t want him here! Even if his 
girl with the twitchy walk did twitch 
out on him!” 

“You’re under arrest, remember?” 

She got it that time. “Yoii actually 
suspect me?” 

“He doesn’t. Wouldn’t hear of it, 
even at first. Me, I’m staying neutral. 
Somebody has to be objective around 
here. Anyway, I want him out of 
sight until I get that light Colonel 
calmed down. You better fix his eye. 
It’s swelling, and he wasn’t pretty to 
begin with. But you wait a day or 
two before you treat that lip, hear? 
He has to be able to talk at your 
trial — and his own.” With that Cay- 
hill glared at both of them and stamp- 
ed out, shooing the crowd ahead of 
him. 

W hen they were alone, Savill 
leaned back ti redly and stared 
at her. “Maybe I am a little stupid at 
that. What’s this about my girl? With 
the — ah — funny walk?” 

“Hah! That cooing biceps patter! 
What her walk says isn’t funny. It’s 
indecent. And you’re always sitting 
with her.” 



“Yom won’t ever stay at my table. 
You keep treating me like a custom- 
er.” 

“And you keep treating me like a 
lady!” 

“Well, hell’s bells, aren’t you?” 

“You could at least have tried to 
find out! Smart cop!” 

She moved, her eyes taking on that 
smoldering, in-character look again. 
After about an hour, or possibly fifty 
seconds, he gasped for breath and 
pushed her away to arms’ length. It 
required, he found happily, consider- 
able effort to keep her there. She had 
been blatantly flaunting the Chief’s 
order about his lip. He found he 
didn’t mind that in the least and he 
was about to let her go when some- 
thing caught his eye. 

Alarmed, he glanced back toward 
the booth. Oh-oh! Sooner or later that 
Termite transmitter was going to up- 
chuck old Murpho. And when it did 
there just might be another Security 
problem. Murderer or not, old MUr- 
pho had still been trying to cheat 
Molly out of her share of the loot. 

And through it all, he saw, she had 
never let go of that length of beer 
hose! 

Oh well. He turned her loose and 
braced himself. A smart cop like Pri- 
vate Savill — under pressure he’d 
think of something!

WEST IS WEST 



by LARRY TRIHEN 

y 



This is fbe real, fhe bonded West — 
as any duck-billed saurian can fell! 



S heriff Matt Cooper was in his of- 
fice reading a dime novel (Psy- 
chedelic Shoot-out at Laser Mesa) 
when the door burst suddenly open 
and Professor Doctor Addams rushed 
noisily across the puncheon floor. 
The old psychiatrist’s leathern face 
was pinched with worry, and he was 
wheezing as if he’d just danced a 
chicken reel at high noon in Bar- 
becue Valley. 

“There’s been a killing in the Dirty 
Lady, Matt! Kreev Cantrell’s been 
shot!” 

Not being one to excite easily. 
Cooper drew himself erect in his 
chair, pushing the dime novel aside. 
His expression was stony as he wait- 
ed for the rest. 

Dropping into a nearby chair. Doc 
Addams tapped his reddened face 
with a checkered handkerchief, a man 
shaken. 



“I saw the whole thing, Matt,” he 
blurted, his voice spilling outrage. 
“Randolph Scott Cartwheel gunned 
down Kieev Cantrell. It was cold- 
blooded murder!” He paused, con- 
sidered the words, then added, 
“in the truest sense, you might say, 
Kreev being a reptilian life-form.” 
Cooper leaned forward now, eyes 
flickering like miniature flintlocks. 
“How about provocation?” 

“Wasn’t any. Nope. Leastways, not 
on Kreev's part. I saw the whole 
thing. They were just sitting there, 
playing cards, peaceful-like, when all 
of a sudden, out of the blue. Cart- 
wheel starts insulting Kreev — just 
kept getting nastier and nastier. Well, 
you know how good-natured Kreev 
always was. He just laughed and said, 
kind of jokingly, ‘Randolph, you’re 
’bout as mean as a Heilian electro- 
carnivore.* Then, quick as a wink. 



118 



Cartwheel ups and yells, ‘When you 
call me that, smile!’ Then he hauled 
out his gun and shot Kreev — three 
slugs in the carapace, three in the 
belly. Just like that!” Doc Addams 
snapped his fingers. “Wasn’t pretty. 
Matt.” 

“Kreev didn’t smile?” 

Doc Addams threw out a stabbing 
gaze. “You’re kidding. Matt? You 
ever see a duck-billed saurian capable 
of smiling? Not this side of Disney, 
you ain’t!” 

Cooper nodded, then got slowly to 
his feet. “Reckon that’s so.” He was 
a tall, rangy man, more muscle than 
bone, with eyes the color of a cyclone- 
whipped sky and dark taut hands 
that could reach for a woman or draw 
a Colt with equal confidence. For 
three months now he had been the 
sheriff of Torn Scalp — ever since 
his lone and mysterious arrival on 
West from Earth in a private flivver. 
At the time the sheriff’s job had been 
open, and Cooper had stepped for- 
ward, canyonesque jaw jutting hero- 
ically, to fill the vacancy. He had 
tamed the' town considerably. 

W ith Doc Addams following him. 
Cooper left the office and 
crossed the dusty main street of Torn 
Scalp toward the Dirty Lady Saloon, 
a no-nonsense den of authentic cor- 
ruption where five dollars would buy 
anything from three fingers of dream 
dram to a night in a back-room pleas- 
ure stall with a hostess and a package 
of inhalo cubes. Above the swinging 
doors of the saloon glittered a huge 
three-dimensional neon sign depicting 
a semi-clad Earth woman smiling in- 
vitingly. 



Cooper pushed his way through the 
swinging doors and strode inside. An 
open-prairie silence filled the room. 
There were some lavender Vegans 
drinking at the bar, minding their 
own business, eyes like gray stones 
under their forward-tilted stetsons; 
except for them the place was de- 
serted. Kreev Cantrell, six feet of 
slim lacertian deadweight, lay slump- 
ed over the green felt of a card table 
in a far corner. The only sound was 
the whisk of the Carolian bartender’s 
polishing cloth as he buffed an Owl- 
hoot Special beaker, goldfish face 
bleakly impassive. 

Cooper went to the corner and ex- 
amined Cantrell’s body, wincing at 
the sight of the punctured midriff. 

He scowled. 

“What is it?” asked Doc Addams, 
at his side. 

“Now I got to ride all the way out 
to the Cartwheel spread,” said Coo- 
per, face darkening into a sullen pout. 
“If I don’t get back early I’ll miss 
the Shane revival tonight at the Iron 
Horse!” 

Doc Addams made a sympathetic 
clucking sound, allowed as how that 
was a shame, but pointed out that a 
Wayne festival was in the offing and 
might compensate. 

Uncheered, Cooper asked him to 
tend to disposing the body while he 
was away. 

Cooper got his horse out of the 
livery stable and rode at a swift gal- 
lop out of town. It was a clear, siz- 
zling day, the broiling sun beaming 
high and yellow like Apache gold, 
and Cooper welcomed the slap of a 
light desert wind against his face. Be- 
fore long he was far from town, in 



WEST IS WEST 



119 




dull open country scattered with mes- 
quite and cactus and an occasional 
patch of jewel-grass. As he rode, he 
switched on his wrist peep and lis- 
tened nostalgically to country and 
western songs being sung by a trio 
called the Saddle Burrs. 

Two hours passed, and Cooper led 
his horse finally up a steep plateau 
grassland to a big white log house 
that stood in dramatic silhouette 
against the drifting sky. He slowed 
from a trot to a walk and, as he 
drew near the house, held the reins 
so that his hands were in conspicuous 
sight. 

T hree tall duck-billed lizards came 
out of the house and stood on 
the porch. They wore denim work 
clothes, but each had a .45 strapped 
on his hip. Cooper knew them well. 
The one in the middle was Benjamin 
Cartwheel. The other two were sons 
of his, Joel McCrea Cartwheel and 
George Armstrong Custer Cartwheel. 
The old lizard’s other son, Randolph 
Scott Cartwheel, was nowhere in 
sight. 

“Howdy, sheriff,” the old lizard 
said in a grizzled voice with no wel- 
come in it. “What brings you?” 
Cooper leaned on his saddle horn, 
smiled thinly. “Where’s Randolph, 
Ben?” 

“Who cares?” 

“You know what he did, Ben. Why 
not make it easy?” 

“Why don’t you go chew some loco 
weed, sheriff?” 

Cooper sighed. “I’d hoped for co- 
operation, Ben. I though you be- 
lieved in the law.” 

Ben Cartwheel laughed — that is 



to say, delivered a reptilian facsimile 
thereof. It sounded like silver dollars 
rattling. 

“I’ll tell you one thing, sheriff,” 
he said, his voice slashing like a scalp- 
ing knife. “When I came to this valley 
twenty years ago it was new land, 
virgin land. I carved a home out of 
it, raised three sons, fought outlaws 
and rustlers and sandbug plagues and 
landgrabbers to keep what I had. I 
didn’t do that, sheriff, to end up 
letting one of my boys dangle at the 
end of a rope swung by some ranny 
who hadn’t even heard of West when 
I was fighting for my life. Creatures 
like me built this country, made it 
what it is, and now you outworld 
driftabouts start pouring in from 
every which way looking for some of 
the gloryl What do you know, punk? 
I’d already seen three different re- 
makes of High Noon when you were 
still in short pants. No, by John Ford, 
you aren’t cutting any ice around 
herel” 

Cooper shrugged, his eyes tinting 
with a sudden ominous darkness. 
“Sorry you feel that way, Ben. Now 
I’ll have to get up a posse. Good 
day.” 

He wheeled his horse around in 
one quick fluid motion and rode 
away. There would be trouble now, 
he knew, and that was too bad, but 
hadn’t he done his whooping best to 
head it off? 

The lanky ease with which Cooper 
had slouched low in the saddle was 
gone now. Instead, he leaned forward 
like a man angling for trout against 
the current of a swift stream, and 
there was in him the straining ten- 
sion of a chicken at the chopping

IF 




block. He went at a fast gallop, 
straight toward town, a restless cloud 
of dust marking his trail behind him. 

TT alfway to town he spotted a 
^ riderless horse standing alone, 
a prone figure sprawled a few yards 
from it. Cooper rode up and dis- 
mounted. 

The figure was Randolph Scott 
Cartwheel, bleeding untidily from 
various bullet wounds and fast ap- 
proaching candidacy for becoming a 
ghost rider in the sky. A thread of 
blood ran down one side of his bill, 
and his eyes blinked with glazed rec- 
ognition as Cooper put an arm about 
his shoulders and held him up. 
“Who did it, Randolph?” 

The voice, when it came, was sibi- 
lant. “It was Venus Rio Brazos, sher- 
iff.” 

Cooper flinched as though he’d 
been standing downwind from a cow 
whose nostrils were threading the 
wind. The one person in Torn Scalp 
he’d always considered absolutely in- 
corruptible was Venus Rio Brazos, 
her unwholesome job as a dime-a- 
dance hostess in the Slender Haunch 
Swirl Palace notwithstanding. The 
truth was he had a hankering for 
her, had for some time. To Cooper 
she was as pretty as the snuff-colored 
robot bison that roamed the plains 
of West, or a winning poker hand the 
week before payday. 

“What happened, boy?” he asked, 
pained. 

Cartwheel strained hard to get his 
last words out. “Said she’d run off 
with me, sheriff ... if I killed Can- 
trell . and took . arid took . .” 
“Easy, boy.” 



“. took the Maltese Longhorn 
Steer . .” 

Cooper’s face became like shale. 

“. then she met me here, plug- 
ged me, lit out with it . .” There 
was a sound in Cartwheel’s throat like 
brisk radio static, then, abruptly, he 
sagged in Cooper’s arms, duckbill 
pointed skyward. 

He was dead. 

Just after sunset, his bull-like 
shoulders set in a determined hunch, 
Cooper pushed through the swinging 
doors of the Slender Haunch Swirl 
Palace. It was dim and cool and 
crowded inside. Out on the big dance 
floor cowboys and their hostesses 
were performing the native dances of 
a dozen different worlds, whirling, 
shimmying, kwurring, hopping, shak- 
ing, and doing shamelessly intimate 
Tendril Slink variations to the accom- 
paniment of mercilessly loud psyche- 
delic music blasting from overhead 
speakers. Cooper stood off to one 
side, watching the dancers until he 
saw Venus Rio Brazos doing a sug- 
gestive crab walk with a lean buck- 
skin-clad man who might have been 
human but for his rainbow-hued skin. 

When the number ended Cooper 
went over and drew Venus Rio Bra- 
zos aside. 

S he was a beautiful Earth girl, 
Spanish, with eyes like candle 
flames in a breeze and breasts so 
sweetly high they seemed to levi- 
tate. Her green silk dress fit her as 
snugly as the husk on an ear of In- 
dian corn. 

“Want to tell me about Cart- 
wheel?” Cooper asked quietly. 

Venus Rio Brazos shot him a chili-

pepper glare. “Oh, you know this?” 
Cooper nodded. “Where’s the Mal- 
tese Longhorn Steer, Miss Brazos?” 
Her face became troubled; she bit 
her lip worriedly, deliberately for a 
moment, then said, *'Senor, I have 
always liked you and I know you 
like me. Maybe we can work what 
you call a deal, no?” 

Watching the buoyancy of her 
breasts. Cooper began to sweat. “I 
got no proof you killed him,” he 
said. “Just his word. Still, the law’s 
the law. Yet, on the other hand, if 
I was to recover the Maltese Long- 
horn Steer, Miss Brazos, we could 
get you a good lawyer and — ” 
“Enough!” she interrupted. “I will 
tell you, sheriff. It is this simple: 1 
knew that Cantrell had the Steer and 
I persuaded Cartwheel to kill him and 
take it by promising to go away with 
him. Then I shot him. Why? Simply 
because your deputy, Fester, and I 
planned it that way. For a long time 
we have courted in secret. When 
Fester found that Cantrell had the 
Maltese Longhorn Steer, he worked 
the plan out so we could have it for 
ourselves, go away together — rich. 
I gladly agreed. It was for love, sher- 
iff. And now, do you wonder about 
my confession?” 

Cooper, blank-faced, heart heavy, 
nodded. 

Venus Rio Brazos smiled. “It is 
because I have taken a small der- 
ringer from my skirt hem while you 
were concentrating on my lovelies, 
sheriff. It is now concealed in my 
palm ready for action, so to speak. 
Comprendo?'* 

Cooper’s mouth tightened. No, he 
thought, he didn’t comprehend at all. 



never would. How, he asked himself, 
could a girl like the one standing be- 
fore him prefer a frivolous, unheroic, 
comedy-relief sidekick like Fester to 
himself? It made no sense. With in- 
jured pride and irritation careening 
through him, he did what he must. 

As in the movies, it was a cinch. 
Looking intently past Venus Rio 
Brazos, he drawled, “Well, I guess 
you two win this hand. Fester.” Then, 
as she glanced behind her, he slapped 
the derringer to the floor. 

Five minutes later she was in a 
cell, yelling like a Delgan dervish 
and banging her spike-heels on the 
steel bars. 

O n his desk Cooper found a note 
from Fester that told, in his 
graceless scrawl, that he had gone 
out of towff to check on a prospec- 
tor’s claim that his pre-fab shack 
had been dismantled by maverick res- 
ervation Indians of Chief Small 
Coke’s tribe and sold to a passing 
real-estate agent. The note added that 
Fester would not be back until 
around ten. 

Cooper assayed his time-piece. It 
was six-thirty, too late to catch 
Shane, but just time enough to make 
the first feature at the Trough. Feel- 
ing that he deserved some entertain- 
ment, he locked up the office, walked 
up Front Street to the box-office, and 
bought his ticket. 

Inside, he pivoted back in the 
foam-eez saddle seat just as the 
credits flashed on the screen. 

The two films — Unknown Quan- 
tities Seize Fort Kearny and Belle 
Starr Meets the Things From Proc-^ 
yon — were both enjoyable, if slight-

ly' bland, and Cooper sat through 
fliem in relaxed quietude. When, 
three hours later, the curtain was 
finally lowered as Belle Starr headed 
her big dun gelding toward a roseate 
sunset, he got slowly to his feet and 
shuffled out of the theater with the 
other creatures. 

Halfway to the office he saw Fes- 
ter emerge from the livery stable at 
the other end of the block. The thin 
Melban panda, seeing him at the 
same moment, waved a forepaw in 
recognition; and they walked toward 
each other, meeting at the wooden 
porch. 

They went inside. Cooper leaving 
the door open to cool the stuffy 
office. Without preamble, he said, 
“Fester, I know about the Maltese 
Longhorn Steer.” 

“Sure,” Fester said. “We finally 
got it. It’s in the desk.” 

Cooper cocked an eyebrow. We?** 
“I told you that dance hall chick 
was sweet on me, man. She digs my 
fur. Never had a pet. It was no prob- 
lem having her cop the thing for me. 
I sweet-talked her, dad. Now we can 
buy the biggest spread on this orb, 
swing in fashion.” 

“Are you trying to implicate me?** 
Cooper shouted, eyes flaring. 

Fester blinked at him, stroking his 
furry chin. His voice came stiffly. 
“Why not, daddy, you planned the 
squip. You knew Cantrell had the 
Steer and you put me to copping it 
with a promise of half the split. Now, 
what’s this clown talk?” 

Cooper shook his head violently, 
but a shade of doubt crossed his face. 
“Do you think I could forget such a 
thing?” 



“Repress is the word,” came a 
voice from the doorway. 

C ooper and Fester both turned to 
see Doc Addams regarding them, 
balefully. He stepped into the office 
and turned to Cooper with a pro- 
fessional expression. 

“I overheard the whole thing, Matt. 
Ever since last week, observation of 
your behavior led me to suspect you 
were repressing something of this 
sort. As my Viennese professor would 
have — 

“Enough!” Cooper cried. Wooden- 
ly, he slouched down behind the desk, 
stared thoughtfully at his hands for 
several seconds, then stood again. 

“I want to make a statement,” he 
said. “I think I can explain. You see, 
as a kid, going to western movies, I 
always had a tendency to do some- 
thing my friends never did — to iden- 
tify with the bad guys as well as the 
good. There was a nice maverick 
quality about such baddies as Barton 
MacClane that never came through 
in the Audie Murphys. What this ten- 
dency of mine did, I figure, was to 
set up a subconscious outlaw versus 
lawman conflict in me. I — I can 
see that now. Doc was right. I re- 
member everything now. The outlaw 
element in me took control and plan- 
ned the theft, then the lawman re- 
pressed it. ” He paused, then 
smiled unexpectedly. “But I’m in con- 
trol now. The sensible element has 
the reins, and it’s the one I’m stick- 
ing with — the outlaw element, that 
is. You’ll both note that, as I’ve been 
jawing. I’ve unholstered my .45. 
Now, Fester, if you’ll be kind enough 
to open the desk drawer and fetch me

But a strange thing happened. As 
Fester was sliding open the drawer, 
an unfamiliar masked man darted 
suddenly into the office moving so 
swiftly he seemed to have material- 
ized from empty air. In a blur of 
motion the stranger flew at both 
Cooper and Fester, pistoning out 
chin and body blows with awesome 
accuracy; and even as the sheriff 
and his deputy toppled, he was whisk- 
ing them back to a vacant cell where, 
like cordwood, he stacked their in- 
sensate forms on the single cot; then, 
as Doc Addams stared, the lone fig- 
ure dashed back out of the office, 
leaving him standing there, alone 
and dazzled, holding a small white 
card that had been thrust into one 
hand. 

Scratching his jaw with the card. 
Doc Addams murmured to himself, 
“I wonder who that masked man 
was.” He looked at the card.

“Never heard of him,” mused Doc 
Addams. “Must be an Easterner.” 

He stood for a long while without 
moving. Then, taking a deep breath, 
he tiptoed to the desk, opened the 
drawer and looked inside. The Mal- 
tese Longhorn Steer was there. 

He closed the drawer and, face 
reddening, began to nonchalantly 
whistle The Entity Waltz- Halfway 
through the tune he broke off sud- 
denly, opened the drawer again and 
took out the Steer. 

He left without saying good-by 
to his friends. END

Illustrated by 



CONCLUSION 



IF • Serial 



The rogue star was mightier than 
any living creature — but its enemy 
was a constellation of gigantic suns! 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



/ n the great monolithic universe of 
joined stars and men, ANDREAS 
QUAMODIAN, Monitor of the 
Companions of the Star, receives a 
message from the girl he loves and 
has given up hope of winning. Back 



on ancient, backwater Earth, MOL- 
LY ZALDIVAR tells him that their 
mutual friend, and the man to whom 
Andy Quam believes he has lost her, 
CLIFF HAWK, is engaged in secret 
and dangerous experiments. She be- 



125 



lieves Hawk is trying to create an 
artificial living organism, a **Rogue 
Star** which unlike the sentient and 
generally benign stellar bodies that 
make up most of the universe*s pri- 
mary stars will use its enormous 
powers for disruption and destruc- 
tion, 

Quam hastens to join her. He man-^ 
ages through the transflection net- 
work which links worlds galaxies 
apart, making instantaneous travel 
possible between Earth and any other 
planet in civilization. He travels mil- 
lions of parsecs in less time than it 
takes to cross a room. But on Earth 
his progress comes to a halt. 

It is Starday, On backward Earth, 
where the symbiosis among men, fu- 
sorians and stars has taken the form 
of a ritualistic religion, this means 
nothing can be done. He cannot go 
to her. He cannot reach her by com- 
municator, He cannot secure a guide. 
He can only wait. 

But Molly Zaldivar hasn*t waited. 
Alone she has gone to the cavern in 
the mountains where Hawk and his 
partner, THE REEFER, a mysteri- 
ous man from space, are conducting 
their experiments. 

As she approaches the cave, she is 
terrified to see a SLEETH, a space 
creature the size of a horse, capable 
of traveling at enormous speeds by 
transflection methods, deadly as an 
interstellar space-destroyer, guarding 
fhe entrance. An explosion knocks 
her out and drives the sleeth away; 
Cliff Hawk and the Reefer find her 
and bring her into the cave. 

Meanwhile Andy Quam has found 
some boys who tell him something of 
what has been happening with Molly 



Zaldivar, Unable to control his pa- 
tience, Quam storms into a Starday 
meeting and demands that the moni- 
tor, a robot, help him. The robot 
refuses at first. But then, when three 
holts of energy from the sun lash 
down and strike at the mountains 
where the cave is located, the robot 
relents and agrees to take Quam 
there. 

It is almost too late. The danger 
Molly Zaldivar warned about has 
come to pass. The experiment has 
succeeded; a Rogue Star has been 
created , , , and it is now beyond 
human control, 

Andy Quam and the robot go to 
the cave and find Molly and the 
Reefer injured but still alive. Cliff 
Hawk is dead. Worse, the rogue has 
absorbed Hawk*s personality into it- 
self — and it does the same thing 
with the sleeth, the robot and many 
smaller beings. It is growing both in 
power and in knowledge with every 
moment. 

But its growth is perverted and 
complicated. With the incorporation 
of what remains of Cliff Hawk into 
its own individuality, the rogue has 
acquired some of Hawk*s traits — 
human traits, incredibly out of place 
in a creature composed of a plasma 
of stripped electrons, brother to stars. 
It even finds itself drawn to Molly 
Zaldivar in a simulacrum of an emo- 
tion like love. It sends out its tool, 
the sleeth, to bring her back to its 
cave. Andy Quam tries to rescue her 
but fails; his flyer is brought down 
by the energies of the sleeth; his half- 
ally, the Reefer, is carried off by the 
rogue*s tools. 

Meanwhile the rogue tells Molly 




of its love. Terrified and repelled, the 
girl calls it a monster — pathetically 
tries to trick it by pretending to re- 
turn its love — but is discovered. The 
rogue learns another emotion: anger. 
It threatens to destroy Molly Zaldi- 
var; she warns it that more powerful 
forces in the universe, like the sen-^ 
tient star, Almalik, will prevent it. 

And the rogue determines to de- 
stroy Almalik and all the brother- 
hood of stars. 

XV 

\ ndy Quam landed his flyer be- 
fore the control dome of the 
transflex cube and grated, “Control 
dome! Connect me direct with Head- 
quarters of the Companions of the 
Star, Almalik three!” 

“Your authorization, sir?” the con- 
trol dome inquired politely. 

“Fully authorized! Highest prior- 
ity!” 

“One moment, sir,” the control 
dome said doubtfully. But it did not 
refuse him. In a moment it said, “I 
am seeking your circuits, sir. There 
is a 200-second delay now estimated; 
will you wait?” 

“You bet ni wait,” growled Andy 
Quam, and sank back in his seat. He 
ached. Battling rogue stars and 
strange beings and men from space 
was not the kind of life he was used 
to, he thought dourly. But if it was 
what he had to do to save Molly 
Zaldivar, he would get used to it! 

A small figure appeared at the 
corner of the square, running hard 
toward him. Tiny spurts of dust 
flowered at his heels, and he was 
panting as he reached the flyer. 



“Preacher^” Rufe gasped. “What 
happened? How’s Molly Zaldivar?” 
“She’s still in the cave,” said 
Quamodian shortly. “I think. Any- 
way, I never saw her.” 

“Then what — w^at are you going 
to do?” 

“Wait.” But they didn’t have to 
wait long. -The speaker clicked and 
hummed, and a sweet non-human 
voice sang: 

“Companions of the Star, Chief 
Warden of Monitors speaking. How 
may I serve you?” 

“You can serve me best,” said An- 
dy Quam belligerently, “by getting 
an emergency survey team out here 
on the double! This is Monitor An- 
dreas Quamodian speaking. I request 
— no, cancel that. I demand imme- 
diate action!” 

The sweet high voice sang sorrow- 
fully, “Ah, Monitor Quamodian. We 
have been advised of your statements 
and actions.” 

“Ha!” barked Andy Quam. “Of 
course you have! You’ve been told of 
my report that a created intellect in 
the form of a rogue star is loose here; 
that I have requested authority to use 
force against it; that I have stated 
that certain humans and non-human 
intellects have been damaged, de- 
stroyed or threatened by it. And 
you’ve ignored what I said.” 

“Unfortunately, Monitor Quamo- 
dian, we have seen no reason to ac- 
cept this report.” 

“You think I’m wrong, eh?” 

“Not ‘wrong,’ Monitor Quamo- 
dian. It is merely that we do not 
assess the same quantitative need for 
action.” 

“I see,” snapped Andy Quam. 



ROGUE STAR

“Then look at it this way% I report 
that a Monitor of the Companions of 
the Star is suffering paranoid delu- 
sions; that he believes himself and his 
friends attacked by monsters; that in 
his insanity he is capable of wildly 
destructive acts of violence; and that 
this will inevitably reflect great dis- 
credit to all Monitors. What quanti- 
tative assessment do you give that!?'* 
“Why — why, Monitor Quamo- 
dian, that’s frightful! We’ll send a 
survey team at once. Who is this de- 
ranged monitor?” 

“Me!” snapped Andy Quam, and 
severed the connection. 

T hey left the flyer grumbling to 
itself in the middle of the square 
before the transflex gate. “ — stupid 
thing to do,” it was saying resent- 
fully. “They’ll take you off the roll of 
Monitors sure. Then what will be- 
come of me? Some menial job ferry- 
ing tourists — ” 

The boy’s house was only minutes 
away, and there Andy Quam shower- 
ed, ate, drank thirstily of the cold, 
rich milk the kitchen machines pro- 
duced for him and braced himself for 
the arrival of the emergency survey 
team. “How long, preacher? How 
long before they get here?” 

Quamodian considered. “Twenty 
minutes to think things over. Half an 
hour to assemble a team. Ten min- 
utes to get their transflex priorities 
approved — a few seconds to travel. 
I’d call it an hour.” 

“Gee! Why, that’s only twenty 
minutes from now. Just think, in 
twenty minutes I’ll be seeing all those 
crazy three-headed beings, and green- 
shelled beetles, and — ” 



“We do not comment on the phy- 
sical peculiarities of any citizen,** 
Andy Quam said firmly. “Didn’t 
your parents teach you that?” 

“Well, yes,” the boy admitted. 
“Come to think of it,” Quamodian 
went on, “where are your parents? 
Aren’t they ever home?” 

The boy shuffled his feet. “Sure, 
preacher. They’re just, uh, busy.” 
“Rufe!” 

“Yes, preacher?” His face was an- 
gelically innocent. 

“Rufe, let’s cut out the nonsense. 
You’re hiding something. I can’t 
imagine what, or why — but let’s 
have it!” 

“Aw, preacher. It’s nothing. It’s 
— ” He looked up at Andreas Quam- 
odian anxiously. Quamodian gazed 
implacably back. “Well,” said the 
boy, “it’s just that they were acting 
a little funny. They’ve gone off in a 
flyer to Nuevo York.” 

“Nuevo York! Why, that’s two 
thousand miles away!” 

“A little more, preacher. Figured 
it’d take them a day or two each 
way.” 

“Why?” 

“Well, that’s the part that’s kind 
of funny. I mean — gee, preacher, 
there’s nothing wrong with my parr 
ents! They’re not crazy or anything. 
TTiey just, well, said the same kind of 
thing you were saying. About some 
sort of rogue intellect loose on the 
earth, and the robot inspector here 
wouldn’t listen to them and they 
didn’t have the right of direct contact 
with Almalik, like you. So they fig- 
ured they’d better report it to Nuevo 
York, where people might be more 
interested.” 



128 



IF 




Quamodian sat up alertly. “You’re 
still hiding something,” he accused. 
“Why would you be ashamed of their 
knowing about the rogue star? It’s 
true, you know.” 

“Sure, preacher. Only — ” 

“Only what?” 

The boy flushed. “It’s just that 
they were talking about it two days 
ago. That’s when they left.” 

Quam said, “But that can’t be! 
The rogue star wasn’t even created 
then! . Oh, I see.” 

The boy nodded unhappily. “That’s 
the part that’s got me a little mixed 
up, preacher. They thought there was 
one when there wasn't” 

T hey were back at the transflex 
cube with minutes to spare, but 
the emergency survey team was ear- 
ly. Evidently they had wasted no 
time. The control dome cried, 
through Quamodian’s flyer radio; 
“Stand back! Keep the area clear for 
a party from Almalik Three, now ar- 
riving!” 

“Gosh,” whispered Rufe. His eyes 
were round as Saturn’s rings, his wor- 
ries about his parents temporarily out 
of his mind. “Where are they, preach- 
er? Shouldn’t they be coming 
through? What’s keeping them? — 

ohr 

A dozen grass-green spiral beings, 
like tiny coils of springs, emerged 
from the cube. They were twisting in 
orbit around each other, approaching 
the man and the boy with a whistle 
of high-frequency sound. “What in 
tarnation is that, preacher?” he asked. 

“It is not courteous to stare. I 
don’t recognize the species; a multi- 
ple citizen of some kind — ” 



“And that! And — oh, gosh, look 
at that one!” 

“All citizens, I’m sure.” But even 
Quamodian drew his breath sharply, 
as from behind a foamy, almost 
translucent bubble of pink there ap- 
peared the shark’s fangs and slitted 
eyes of a citizen of clearly carnivor- 
ous ancestry. The rest of the citizen 
was no improvement; it loped on 
enormously powerful clawed legs like 
a kangaroo’s, possessed two pairs of 
upper limbs that seemed boneless and 
lithe as an elephant’s trunk, termi- 
nated in vivid blue manipulating or- 
gans that were almost the duplicate 
of a star-nosed mole. 

But the fourth member of the 
team, and the one who advanced on 
Andy Quam, was human enough. In 
fact, she was lovely. 

“Monitor Quamodian?” she de- 
manded. “I am Clothilde Kwai 
Kwich, temporarily assigned to clean 
up the mess here on Earth and thus 
your acting supervisor. What the dev- 
il have you idiots been up to?” 

Andy Quam swallowed hard. He 
wiped the palm of his hand on his 
tunic and extended it to her for shak- 
ing. “I — I’m delighted to meet you. 
Miss — ” 

“Kwai Kwich,” she said, clearly 
and emphatically. ^'Monitor Kwai 
Kwich. Please speak briefly and re- 
sponsively, when it is necessary for 
you to speak at all. These other citi- 
zens and I have little time to waste, 
and we wish to use it effectively. I 
suppose our best first move is to 
make an on-site investigation of the 
locus of the alleged events which you 
have tricked us into coming here to 
investigate.” 



ROGUE STAR 



129 




“Certainly,” said Andy Quam 
feebly, propping his unshaken hand. 
“Of course. That’s why I was hop- 
ing — ” 

“My associates can of course pro- 
vide their own transport but, as you 
see, I am myself human. I assume 
you have some sort of vehicle?” 

“Oh, yes. This one right here.” 

“Then shall we go?” And Monitor 
Kwai Kwich brushed past him with- 
out a word to enter the waiting flyer. 

Dazed, Andy Quam turned to fol- 
low, but the boy caught his sleeve. 
“Say, preacher!” he hissed furiously. 
“What the dickens is the matter with 
you?” 

Quam stared at him blankly. After 
a moment he shook his head and fol- 
lowed the girl into the flyer. He 
didn’t know what to say. It was just 
that he was astonished at his tem- 
porary supervisor’s appearance. 

She wore the garb of an urbane, 
sophisticated citydweller, her face 
made up almost past the point of 
visible humanity, her hair impeccably 
coiffed. But change her clothes and 
makeup, Andy Quam thought — put 
a siipple dress on her instead of the 
mirror-bright tights, the fluffed bod- 
ice and shoulders, the diamond of 
bare skin at the back; scrub her face 
of the two-inch angled eyebrows and 
bright blue eyeshadow and rouge — 
and Monitor Clothilde Kwai Kwich 
would become a dead ringer for Mol- 
ly Zaldivar. 

XVI 

T he rogue was much larger now, 
and wiser, and stronger. 

It did not seem much different in 



the despairing eyes of Molly Zaldi- 
var, for at best it was only a cloud 
of stripped surging electrons, a con- 
trolled violence of particles that 
would have been her death if the 
rogue’s own energies had not kept its 
components bound to its central mass. 
But it had fed and grown. It had 
assimilated neural reactions from 
Cliff Hawk, the robot, the sleeth, the 
hundred living creatures larger than 
microorganisms that it had absorbed 
into itself. It was by no means finish- 
ed with either growing or learning. 
Perhaps it could be called adolescent. 
Almost mature in size and strength 
and intelligence. Far from mature in 
its understanding of itself. 

Molly made no sound as the ra- 
diant whirl summoned the sleeth to 
it, and entered into the black terrify- 
ing shape of the predator from space. 
The sleeth dropped down upon her 
and caught her, coldly but harmless- 
ly, in its razored talons, now sheath- 
ed in slick, cold chitin. It rose with 
her through the center of the globe, 
flew through the cold core of that 
edgeless opal glow and on and out, 
tracing the endless passageways to 
the surface. 

Molly did not stir. She was past 
fear and worry; she was not resigned, 
but she was passive. 

She would not have struggled even 
if she had known how close to death 
that murderous opal glow had 
brought her. But she really did not 
know. 

She did not respond even in the 
hues of emotion by which the rogue 
interpreted her mental state. No 
green blaze of hate, no blues or vio- 
lets of fear. No spark of love; emo-

IF 




tion had left her, leaving her dark, 
and empty, and merely waiting. 

Bearing Molly Zaldivar in the bub- 
ble of atmosphere trapped in the 
sleeth’s transflection fields, the rogue 
left the round Earth. 

Tardily they dawdled through the 
“thick” gases that were the solar at- 
mosphere — so tenuous at one A.U. 
that human instruments could barely 
record them, and human bodies 
would have burst and foamed; but 
still too thick for the sorts of speed 
that the sleeth, commanded and driv- 
en by the starlike energies of the ro- 
gue, could develop. But even so, in 
minutes they were past gassy Jupiter 
and Saturn; the void was more nearly 
empty now, and the rogue drove the 
sleeth more fiercely. 

So fiercely that time seemed to 
stop. 

These were not physical energies 
that the rogue commanded now; they 
were the transflection fields of the 
sleeth and itself. They leaped through 
empty spaces, through folded light 
and darkness, through bitter cold and 
twisting force and giddy deeps of 
vastness, leaped to the golden suns of 
Almalik .... 

And were there. 

A thin sighing shout whispered pas- 
sionately in the ears of Molly 
Zaldivar: 

“Observe!” it shrieked, almost 
soundlessly. “I have begun to destroy 
Almalik!” 

“You cannot,” she said bleakly. 
“Observe!” it shrieked again, and 
subsided. It was the molecules of at- 
mosphere itself that the rogue was 
shaking now, to make sounds that the 



girl could hear; it could produce lit- 
tle volume, but in the girl’s tiny bub- 
ble of air, gazing at the twelve bright 
but distant stars and one nearby, 
blinding sun that was Almalik, in the 
middle of the awful soundlessness of 
interstellar space, there was no other 
sound loud enough to drown it out, 
nothing but her own heart and breath 
and the faint mindless singing of the 
sleeth. 

“I begin!” whispered the tiny 
scream, and like a hawk swooping its 
prey the rogue drove them toward 
the nearest planet. 

It was a small world, less than 
Pluto and farther from its primary; 
the horizon was queerly rounded, the 
surface mottled with creeping blobs 
of liquid gas. 

With a power summoned from its 
infinite reserves, the rogue seized it, 
entered it — became it. It grew once 
more. It fed quickly and avidly, seiz- 
ed new atoms, sucked electrons into 
the spreading patterns of its being, 
took new energies from frozen stone. 
It reached out to survey the space 
around itself, found ions, gas mole- 
cules, a hurtling moonlet — and far- 
ther off, a small metal mass inhabited 
by organic masses of organized mat- 
ter. The rogue did not know it was 
a spaceship, did not care. 

It drew the spaceship and the 
sleeth at once to itself. The ship 
crashed bruisingly on the surface of 
the tiny world. With the sleeth it was 
far more gentle, but not gentle 
enough. The creature struck against 
a spire of frozen hydrates, screamed 
soundlessly and went limp. And as it 
lost control, with it went the bubble 
of air it carried in its transflection

fields, and Molly Zaldivar lay open 
to the murderous empty cold of 
space. 

F or many nanoseconds the rogue 
considered what it had done. As 
best it knew how to do so, it felt 
alarmed. 

At length it seized upon a buried 
shelf of rock beneath the frozen gas- 
es and shook it to make words. 
“Molly Zaldivar!” rumbled the plan- 
et. “What is happening to you?” 

The girl did not answer. She lay 
cradled in a bed of the planet’s — of 
the rogue’s own, now — crystal snow, 
beside the crumpled black body of 
the sleeth. She did not breathe; there 
was no longer any air for her to 
breathe. Dark blood frothed and 
froze on her face. 

“Molly Zaldivar!” groaned the 
rock of the planet’s crust. “Answer!” 
But there was no answer. 

The rogue tested its powers, felt its 
new magnitude. Now it was a planet, 
its coat of frozen gas a skin, its crag- 
ged granite mountains bones, its deep 
pools of cooling magma a heart of 
sorts. The rogue was not used to so 
large a body. It regretted (insofar as 
it understood regret) that its body 
was unkind to Molly Zaldivar, too 
airless, too cruelly cold. 

From the wreckage of the space- 
ship, organized masses of organic mat- 
ter were exiting, clad in metallic arti- 
ficial skins. The rogue did not recog- 
nize that they were citizens and 
might be of help to Molly Zaldivar; 
it reached out a thoughtless effector 
and slew them. And then it again 
practiced the sensation it experienced 
as regret; for it realized that they 

112 



had owned supplies of water and air, 
warmth and pressure that could have 
been used for Molly Zaldivar. 

No matter. The rogue was now the 
planet and could dispose of the plan- 
et’s resources. It would not let her 
die. 

It shielded her from the cold, 
warmed the frozen gas around her 
and cupped it in a sphere of trans- 
flection forces. With bits of matter 
taken from the creatures it had de- 
stroyed it healed the damage to her 
lungs. It warmed her stiffened body, 
helped her breathe again, found the 
spark of life in her .... 

And tjie girl stirred and spoke. 

“What are you doing, monster?” 
she moaned. 

“I am saving your life, Molly Zal- 
divar,” rumbled the rocks. “I am 
destroying Almalik!” 

“You cannot, monster,” sobbed the 
girl. 

“Observe!” 

The rogue’s transflection field was 
vaster now, spreading to hold all its 
continents of dark and ancient rock, 
its seas of snow, all its great mass. 

With all its might, the rogue pre- 
pared to strike at Almalik. 

It halted the planet in its orbit and 
turned inward, toward that white and 
splendid single sun, the brightest star 
of Almalik. 

And in its hate for Almalik it 
drove inward, toward collision with 
the star. 

T he sleeth was cruelly hurt; but 
the creature that had been bred 
to kill pyropods in space was not 
easily killed. It stirred. The great 
empty eyes gazed into space, then 



IF 




bent to look into the eyes of Molly 
Zaldivar. Ripples of muscles pulsed 
under the dark, hard flesh. Ijs trans- 
flection fields grew again; it lifted 
lightly from the frozen gas on which 
it lay, and its high singing sound 
grew in volume. The sleeth was not 
an intelligent creature as Man is in- 
telligent, or the other citizens of the 
galaxies; but it had awareness. It 
recognized that something had owned 
it for a time; it felt that the some- 
thing was gone, now that the rogue 
had retreated to explore its new plan- 
etary body. It remembered Molly 
Zaldivar .... 

And when the rogue next turned 
its attention to the girl she was gone. 

The rogue was quick to search for 
her, and find her. She was in flight. 

Mounted on the sleek black shoul- 
ders of the sleeth, veiled in its trans- 
flection fields, she was climbing away 
from the rogue planet’s frigid skin 
of snow, flying toward the inner 
planets of that great white star to- 
ward which the planet was plunging. 

The rogue thrust out a darting arm 
of plasma, of its own electrons mesh- 
ed in transcience forces. It reached 
to overtake her, pierced effortlessly 
the sleeth’s transflection shield, shook 
her small sphere of air with an ef- 
fector. 

“Where are you going, Molly Zal- 
divar?” the air screamed shrilly in 
her ear. 

She turned her head to look at the 
rogue’s shining plasma finger, but she 
did not answer. The rogue paused, 
considering. There was strangeness 
here. Strange that to the rogue she 
seemed so very lovely. The redder 
suns of Almalik struck red fire from 



her hair; the blue suns burned violet 
in her eyes. But why should these 
things matter? the rogue asked itself, 
interested and curious. Why shouk^ 
the remembered and absorbec- 
thought-patterns of the organized 
matter called Cliff Hawk exert sc 
powerful an influence on it still? The 
rogue made the air shriek in a pierc 
ing whisper again: “I love you, Mol 
ly Zaldivar. Once I was tinier than 
you, so small you could not see me; 
now I am so huge you are no more 
than a fleck of dust. We have never 
been akin, and I see no bridge fo:^ 
love between us . but I love youf* 
“You’re insane, monster,” she said 
at last. But her eyes were gentle.^ 
The rogue pondered. “Where are 
you going?” it demanded again. 

“I am flying to the inhabited plan- 
ets of Almalik. On Kaymak they will 
deal with you — once I warn them.” 
“Do you hate me, Molly Zaldi- 
var?” 

The girl frowned at its bright sen- 
sor and shook her head. “You can’t 
help what you are.” 

The rogue scanned all her matter 
for the cold green blaze of fury; it 
was absent. Eagerly it asked: “Then 
do you love me now?” 

Her face crinkled oddly about the 
eyes, the skin tawny gold beneath 
Almalik’s far suns. “How could I? 
I am human — you a monster!” And 
her violet eyes were damp as they 
peered at the rogue’s shining sensor. 
“I love you . .” 

“Insane!” sobbed the girl. And 
then, “Perhaps I pity you, because 
you are so sadly deformed, because 
all your power is thrown away.” She 
shook her head vigorously, the color- 



ROGUE STAR 



133 





134 




ed lights of Almalik dancing in her 
hair. ‘Tm only sorry for you!” 

She paused, and said: “If I am in 
love, I think it must be with little 
Andy Quam. Monster, I will go back 
to him. Once I get to the inhabited 
planets and give my warning — and 
you are destroyed — I will go to him 
through a transflex station. But I pity 
you, monster.” 

“I will not be destroyed.” 

“You will be destroyed — unless 
you kill me first, and keep me from 
warning the inhabited worlds.” 

The rogue thought for microsec- 
onds. Then at last it shook the air 
again. “I will not destroy you,” the 
air shrieked. “But I will not be de- 
stroyed. Observe! I will kill Almalil^; 
before you can warn anyone!” 

And it withdrew its plasma arm, as 
the girl stared wonderingly after. 

T he rogue flexed its energies, and 
prepared for the assault. 

It tightened the transflectipn fields 
that held and moved its planetary 
mass. The agonized rock of its man- 
tle screamed and grated as it flatten- 
ed its bare black peaks, compressed 
its deserts of snow, squeezing itself 
into a denser projectile. It drove itself 
toward the blazing sun. 

/ mil die, thought the rogue. So 
will Almalik, 

Tardily, almost carelessly, the con- 
geries of massed beings that made up 
the total of Almalik took note of the 
intruder and lifted a careless effector 
to defend itself. 

It was not the white star ahead of 
the rogue that resisted. That sun lay 
steadily glowing, ignoring the threat. 
But from a mighty double sun above 



it, a golden giant and its immense 
blue companion, spinning close to- 
gether, a bolt was launched. 

The bolt sprang from the inner 
plasmas of the golden star, and its 
energies were huge. An enormous 
leaping snake, thicker than the ro- 
gue’s own snow-encrusted planetary 
body, blazed bright as the star itself. 
It flashed with transflection speed 
across the void, faster than the rogue 
could move to evade it. 

But it bypassed the rogue, and 
struck toward Molly Zaldivar. 

Even at the planetary distances 
that already separated them, the ro- 
gue could see the red flash of terror 
through her being as she saw that 
darting coil of golden fire. Help me, 
monster! she cried; the rogue could 
hear no words, but the message was 
clear, and it responded. 

It hurled out an arm of its own 
ions and their linking transcience en- 
ergies, coiling it into a plasma shield 
around the girl and the sleeth. But it 
was not strong enough. The golden 
arm of Almalik was stronger; it burst 
through the shielding plasma wall, 
coiled a net of golden fire around 
Molly and the sleeth and snatched 
them away toward that double sun. 

The rogue could not help her. But 
an emotion that it could not identify 
as savage joy filled all its patterned 
mass. She called me. She asked my 
help. If I cannot help her, / still can 
destroy this near white star of Alma- 
lik! 

T he rogue paused, testing itself, 
preparing itself to dispose of 
energies greater than even it had yet 
employed. It was not strong enough, 



136 



IP 




it calculated coldly. Not yet. It need- 
ed to be stronger. 

The planet was cold, but at its core 
it was not yet dead; crushed gelid 
masses of iron and heavier metals 
still seethed, not yet congealed into 
solids, not yet exhausted of radio- 
activity and heat. From them the ro- 
gue devoured energy and strength. 
Controlled lightnings flashed along its 
plasma paths. The planetary mass of 
its body was now no more than a 
slinger’s pebble to it; a weapon, a 
missile, a way of killing Almalik. 

The rogue intensified its driving 
field until its crushed mountain 
ranges smoked, and the dCvSerts of 
snow thawed and bubbled into boil- 
ing seas. The deep core shuddered 
with earthquake shocks; arcs and au- 
roras raged through its reborn air. 

The rogue plunged on to shatter 
the enemy star. 

But Almalik was not unprepared. 

From the binary sun above, the 
golden spear of plasma stabbed at 
the rogue again. It pierced all the 
shielding fields, burned through its 
steaming seas, exploded its crust and 
jarred its heart with seismic waves. 
The rogue coldly calculated its dam- 
age. Much. Not too much. I still can 
kill Almalik! 

The plasma snake recoiled to strike 
again, again, pocking all the rogue’s 
surface with enormous glowing crat- 
ers, shattering its being with waves of 
destruction that the rogue felt as sear- 
ing pain. 

But the rogue would not let itself 
be destroyed. 

It drew on its last immense re- 
serves to increase the power of its 
transflection shields, holding all the 



atoms of its shattered planetary mas^ 
in a remorseless, destroying grip. 
Daring — and learning — it even 
reached out to suck new energies 
from the plasma snake itself. 

Molly Zaldivar and the sleeth were 
gone now, lost even to the rogue’s 
far-ranging perceptions as the plasma 
coil drew them back toward some 
distant planet’s surface. Every bit of 
matter of more than molecular di- 
mensions for many A.U.s around was 
gone, drawn into the rogue itself or 
volatilized by the seething energies 
employed. 

But the rogue was not destroyed. It 
plunged on to strike the unresisting 
white sun.

44TV yTonitor Quamodian,” said the 

-LVx flyer chattily, “you’re not 
going to hear much with your bare 
ears. They’re talking about you.” 

Quam glanced at Monitor Cloth- 
ilde Kwai Kwich, who was inspecting 
the fittings of the flyer with distaste 
and apparently whispering to herself. 
“I don’t know if I want to hear,” 
he muttered. 

The girl said aloud, without look- 
ing at him, “What you want makes 
little difference. Monitor Quamo- 
dian. There will no doubt be times 
when the other citizens will have in- 
quiries to direct to you, or instruc- 
tions. I do not wish to be distracted 
by relaying messages, therefore equip 
yourself with proper hearing facili- 
ties.” 

Andy Quam grumbled, but accept- 
ed the tiny earpiece the flyer offered 
him on an effector. “ — flimsy old

wreck,” piped a shrill voice in his ear 
as he put it on. “We will follow, but 
kindly move as rapidly as you can.” 
The voice had an odd humming, al- 
most echoing quality, as though a 
well trained chorus were speaking in 
almost perfect unison. Quamodian 
guessed it was the multiple citizen of 
green spirals. 

He. disregarded them, quickly in- 
spected his flyer. Its homeostatic de- 
vices had repaired the damage, re- 
stored the rack of flares. Not that 
they would be needed, he hoped. Or 
would be of any use if they were. But 
they were better than nothing. 

“We’re all set,” he announced. “I 
guess.” 

Monitor Kwai Kwich said, with 
offensive patience: “Then can we 
not begin?” 

Quamodian hunched grimly over 
the controls and ordered the flyer 
into the air. The sun was in his eyes 
as they spun and rose. Nearly dou- 
bled in diameter, its red disk was now 
so dull that his naked eyes could 
watch it without discomfort. Dark 
splotches marred it. He thought of 
saying something to the girl, but de- 
cided against it — although she, com- 
ing from Kaymak, might not realize 
there was anything odd about its ap- 
pearance. Let her find out, he 
thought. It didn’t matter anyway. All 
that mattered was that he now had 
help — a kind of help — against the 
rogue. 

They arrowed south across the nar- 
row laJ^ and the first dark foothills, 
the multiple green citizen and the 
pinkly glowing cloud following ef- 
fortlessly behind. The predator citi- 
zen with the enormous fangs lolled 



silently on the padded seats behind 
Andy Quam and the girl, while Rufe 
sat on the floor beneath it, looking 
apprehensively at its teeth. There was 
a continuing buzz of conversation on 
the transcience bands coming through 
his earpiece, but Quamodian disre- 
garded it. He was not interested in 
their opinions of his flyer, himself or 
the planet that had spawned human- 
ity. All he wanted from them was 
their help. 

It was dark as they reached the 
hill that held the cave; the sun was 
still son^e distance above the horizon, 
but its dulled rays gave only a loom- 
ing twilight in the sky, very little on 
the ground about the cavemouth. He 
circled the dark mouth of the cave, 
searching for the sleeth or any hostile 
thing. There was nothing. All the 
landscape held that ominous tinge of 
red, but nothing moved on it. 

Flying warily he approached the 
rubble of the demolished door. 

44T^eserted,” sang the tiny chorus 
of the grass-green spirals. 
“We detect nothing. Another en- 
trance exists lower down.” 

Monitor Clothilde Kwai Kwich 
glanced hesitantly at Andy Quam. 
“There is a good deal of destruction 
here,” she admitted. 

“I told you!” 

“Yes. Perhaps there has been ar^ 
error.” 

“Lower down!” chanted the spi- 
rals. “Other indications! Worth in- 
vestigating!” And the soft whisper 
of the cottony-pink cloud citizen sigh- 
ed: 

“Forces have been deployed in the 
lower area of considerable magni- 



138 



IF 




tude. Forces still exist in being of 
unusual characteristics.” 

Monitor Kwai Kwich said, almost 
apologetically, “We should investi- 
gate.” 

“Right,” rasped Quamodian, and 
sent the flyer spinning down around 
the mountain, searching for the low- 
er entrance. The pink cloud citizen 
was there before him, hovering like 
a puff of steam at the spout of a ket- 
tle before the tunnel mouth. 

“You lead,” it sighed. “Dispersed 
matter like myself may be vulner- 
able.” 

But Quamodian had not waited for 
permission. He thrust the flyer into 
the tight throat of the tunnel, prob- 
ing with its searchlights for the sleeth, 
for Molly Zaldivar, for any trace. All 
he found was the tightening spiral 
passage itself, lined with evidences of 
destruction. “Forces of great magni- 
tude,” chanted the spirals, whirling 
about a burst wall, a ripped stan- 
chion. “Evidence of transflection en- 
ergies. Evidence of plasma activity.” 

Rufe, forgetting his fear of the 
long-toothed citizen behind him, 
stood leaning over Quamodian’s 
shoulder. “Gee, preacher,” he whis- 
pered, thrilled. “Look at that! Some- 
thing really racked this place up!” 

There was no doubt about that. 
Staring about as the flyer slid 
smoothly forward on its transflection 
fields, Quamodian saw that what had 
happened in this tiny enclosed space 
had involved more than merely 
chemical energies. For the first time 
he really understood what was meant 
by a “rogue star”; tiny though the 
creature had been, less than a gram 
in weight at first, it had commanded 



forces capable of thrusting steel and 
rock out of its way like tissue. 

The long-snouted predator citizen 
lifted its muzzle and howled a sen- 
tence; the translator in Quamodian’s 
ear rendered it as: “Be careful! 
Monitor Kwai Kwich, should not we 
report to Almalik before going on!” 
The girl bit her lip, was about to 
speak; but Quamodian overrode her. 
“No!” he rasped. “You waited . too 
long already. Molly Zaldivar may be 
dying — may even be — ” He did not 
finish the sentence. 

Then they were at the center of 
the spiral. Quamodian glanced down, 
swallowed, looked at the girl . then 
tipped the flyer down into the central 
shaft. 

C autiously they dropped down the 
shaft, Quamodian’s flyer first, 
the multiple grass-green citizen sec- 
ond, the pink cloud hovering timor- 
ously behind. Below them a misty, 
opalescent disk of pale light expand- 
ed slowly into a sphere, and they 
entered the great round chamber be- 
low the hill. 

“Astonishing,” breathed Monitor 
Clothilde Kwai Kwich. 

The tardy cloud-citizen sighed 
fearfully: “The energies are consid- 
erable! I am reluctant to come clos- 
er.” 

“Stay, then,” grunted Quamodian, 
staring about. “I wonder — What is 
it? Do you have any information?” 
The girl shook her head. ”Some 
ancient military installation, I sup- 
pose. Perhaps from the days of the 
Plan of Man. The records no longer 
exist for much of that period .... 
But that fusion fire!” She pointed at 



ROGUE STAR 



139 




the cloud of opal mist that hung 
above the high steel platform, “What 
a source of energy! I almost believe 
that you are right, Monitor Quamo- 
dian. With power like that one might 
really attempt to create a star!” 

Andy Quam chuckled sourly, but 
did not answer. Hands sweating on 
the flare controls, he dived to a foot 
or less above the water-stained floor 
of the sphere. The ripped and flat- 
tened orange-painted cab, the dis- 
membered motor and tracks of the 
handling machine gave him an un- 
pleasant start; something had thrown 
them about in rage, it seemed. And 
there were other fragments there 
among the torn and broken metal 
bits. A primitive white-painted food 
refrigerator? Quam did not recognize 
it at first, did not understand its 
purpose even then — but finally 
shook with the realization of what it 
meant: Molly Zaldivar had been here. 
The food could have been for no 
one but her. 

But it too had been dropped or 
flung; the door was twisted ajar, 
small packets of food were sprinkled 
across the wreckage. And beyond 
them, what was that crushed black 
shape that lay athwart the grating 
that attempted to carry seepage away? 

Clothilde Kwai Kwich recognized 
it first: “A robot inspector!” she 
gasped. “Then — then it’s all true?” 

Rufe said complainingly, “True? 
Gosh, Miss Kwai Kwich, what’ve we 
been telling you all along? Of course 
it’s true!” 

It was too late for Andy Quam to 
feel triumph. He hardly heard the 
exchange. Eyes narrowed, thought- 
ful, he was darting the flyer’s beams 



into every section of the vast sphere. 
There was nothing else to be seen. 
The wreckage on the floor, the spi- 
dery steel tower and its ominously 
glittering mist of fusion energy, the 
water-stained walls themselves. Noth- 
ing more. 

Molly Zaldivar had been here, he 
was sure of that. But she was here no 
longer. 

Where had she gone? 

T he nervous sigh of the cloud-citi- 
zen interrupted him. “These en- 
ergies,” it whispered despairingly, 
“they are ionizing my gases, interfer- 
ing with my particulate control. I 
must return to the surface.” 

“Go ahead,” said Quam absently. 
“Perhaps we should do the same,” 
bayed the predator in the back seat. 
“This is dangerous!” 

“In a minute,” said Andy Quam. 
He was observing, remembering, an- 
alyzing. Dispassionately he realize, 
with a small surface part of his brain, 
that from the moment Molly Zaldi- 
var’s message had reached him, gal- 
axies away, he had been allowing his 
love and his emotions to drive him. 
His carefully trained reasoning facul- 
ties, the trait of analysis and synthesis 
which was so basic a part of his in- 
doctrination as a monitor, had been 
ignored. 

But now he was using them again, 
and a picture was unfolding under 
his eyes. Cliff Hawk, rebel, adven- 
turer, skilled transcience expert. The 
Reefer, callous misogynist. The two 
of them together in this place, given 
these energies, the months and even 
years of time when they had been 
left unsupervised. 



140 



IF 




It was all quite logical, he noted 
abstractly. Hawk’s scientific hunger; 
the Reefer’s loathing for humanity 
and, above all, the fusorian brother- 
hood; the people, the place, the facil- 
ities. They had used them to create a 
rogue, and in return the rogue had 
thrust them aside, or killed them, or 
ignored them. 

But it had not ignored Molly Zal- 
divar. 

The rogue was no longer present; 
its energies would have been detected 
by any of the citizens in the party. It 
had gone. And wherever it had gone, 
Quamodian felt certain, there would 
be Molly Zaldivar as well. 

The girl monitor said hesitantly, 
“Andy. I mean. Monitor Quamo- 
dian . .” 

“Eh? What is it?” 

“Perhaps the other citizens are 
ri^t. I — I don’t like the look of 
this place.” 

Quamodian frowned. Then a fear- 
some suspicion crossed his mind. 
“Qothilde! What was it the cloud 
said?” 

“You mean the cit — 

“Yes! About the energies!” 

“Why, it said they were ionizing 
gases. It has returned to the open 
air.” 

“Flyer!” cried Andy Quam. “Ana- 
lyze those radiations! Quickly!” 

The flyer said sulkily, “Thought 
you’d never ask. Sustained lethality, 
ei^t times permissible levels. Safe 
period at this distance, one hour. We 
have now been exposed to them for 
nineteen minutes, and I was going 
to give an alert in sixty seconds.” 
“Get us out of here!” ordered An- 
dy Quam. “Fast!” 



The flyer bucked, spun, drove up- 
ward toward the tunnel. Quamodian 
stared out the viewplate. The glowing 
deadly sphere of li^t flashed past his 
field of vision, then the tight spiral of 
the tunnel walls; but he did not see 
them. 

Andy Quam was seeing something 
quite different, and far worse. 

The radiation from that glittering 
mist of nuclear fire that had flamed 
for ages in the spherical cave was 
deadly. 

The flyer’s instruments had meas- 
ured its intensity. They were reliable. 
Quamodian had installed and check- 
ed them himself. If they said that the 
maximum safe dose was one hour, 
then there was no question, to a 
probable error of no more than a 
few minutes one way or another. 

It was not Quamodian’s own safe- 
ty that concerned him, nor Monitor 
Clothilde Kwai Kwich’s, nor the 
boy’s. 

How long had Molly- Zaldivar been 
held prisoner in that cave, soaking in 
those deadly rays? 

Quamodian’s arithmetic could be 
little more than a guess. But it was 
eighteen hours or more since she had 
been stolen from the little bedroom 
of Rufe’s house. It was not sensible 
to suppose that less than half of that 
time had been spent in the cave. 

And if it was in fact true that she 
had been there that long, or anything 
close to that long, Molly Zaldivar 
was already as good as dead. 

XVIII 

T hey burst out into the cold night 
air. And even in his fear and 



ROGUE STAR 



141 




anguish Andy Quam stared incredu- 
lously at the sky. 

Overhead lay a lacy net of blue 
and violet fire. Great pale slow light- 
nings of color writhed through the 
heavens, soundlessly and hugely; they 
were so bright that trees cast shadows 
on the rocky hillside, blurred shad- 
ows of color that moved with the 
supple shifting of the aurora. 

The carnivorous citizen thrust its 
long muzzle forward, past Quamo- 
dian’s cheek. He felt its hot, faintly 
fishy breath on his ear as it whined 
softly, “This spectacle does not ap- 
pear usual. Can you explain it?” 

Quamodian said simply, “I think 
our own sun has gone rogue.” 

“But that’s impossible,” cried the 
girl. “Sol is not an intellectic body! 
No trace of volition has ever been 
detected!” 

Quamodian spread his hands, in- 
dicating the violence of the aurora. 
“Then you explain it,” he said. 

The distant chorus of the grass- 
green spirals chimed in, “We have 
recorded reflected intensity of stellar 
emissions. They have approximately 
doubled. Three conjectures: One, that 
this star is pre-nova; improbable. 
Two, that previous soundings to de- 
termine intellect in this star have been 
in error; improbable. Three, that it 
has acquired volition.” 

“You mean it’s gone rogue?” the 
girl demanded. “What probability do 
you give that?” 

“No assessment,” chanted the spi- 
rals. “No known data for compari- 
son.” 

“Report to Almalik!” ordered the 
girl. “You, citizen! You have tran- 
science facilities!” 



But the spirals replied, “Our sig- 
nals from Almalik are disordered. 
We cannot comprehend their mean- 
ing. Nor can we receive acknowl- 
edgment of our own reports.” 
Quamodian had had enough. “For- 
get Almalik!” he orderfd. “And nev- 
er mind about the sim, either; we can 
worry about that later. Right now I’m 
worried about a girl. A human girl 
named Molly Zaldivar. Perhaps she 
is somewhere nearby, with or with- 
out the rogue intellect. Can any of 
you detect her?” 

Silence. 

“Try!” roared Andy Quam. Then, 
sulkily, the predator citizen lifted its 
muzzle. 

“For some time now,” it bayed 
softly, the transcience receptor in 
Quamodian’s ears converting it into 
words he could understand, “I have 
registered the presence of quarry on 
that far hill.” 

“Quarry?” 

“An ancestral trait,” the citizen 
explained. “It is a particular refine- 
ment of chemosampling in ambient 
air. What you call the sense of smell. 
But — is not Monitor Kwai Kwich 
‘human girl’ and are not you ‘human 
male,’ Monitor Quamodian?” 
“Certainly! What about it?” 

“Then this quarry cannot be what 
you seek. It is male. And it is severe- 
ly injured.” 

T hey skimmed over the pitted 
road, dropped toward the hill- 
side where the carnivore citizen had 
scented a man. Its sense of smell had 
not been in error. 

The man was the Reefer, huddled 
against the trunk of a bent ever-

greea tree. He looked gray and ill 
in the flickering colored lights of the 
aurora. One arm, badly swollen, was 
in a sling. He gazed up at the flyer 
apathetically as Quamodian jumped 
out. 

“I want a word with you,” Andy 
Quam shouted. 

The Reefer growled hoarsely, 
“Make it short. I’m a sick man.” 

“Where is the rogue? Where is 
Molly Zaldivar?” 

The Reefer shifted his weight awk- 
wardly, flinching from the move- 
ment of his arm. “Gone. I don’t 
know where.” 

“When?” 

The Reefer shook his head wear- 
ily. Pale with pain, he pulled a short 
black stick from his pocket, gnawed 
the end off it and began chewing 
grimly. “A root that grows on the 
Reefs,” he said, his voice almost in- 
audible. “Filthy to chew, I guess, but 
it eases pain. It has always been my 
personal substitute for Almalik .... 
When did the rogue go? I don’t 
know. It dumped me here this after- 
noon. Couple hours ago something 
went on over there — ” he gestured 
weakly at the hill that lay over the 
cave — “and I saw something bright 
in the sky.” 

“The aurora?” Quamodian de- 
manded. 

“No! That’s been going on since 
dark. This was something else. I 
think . .” His voice trailed off; he 
shook hknself and finished: “I think 
the rogue is out in space. Maybe took 
the girl with him.” 

Monitor Clothilde Kwai Kwich in- 
terrupted. “Andy! This man is dying. 
I suggest we get him to a hospital.” 



The Reefer grinned painfully, 
worked his lips for a second, then 
jetted a stream of black liquid at a 
rock. “Good idea, miss,” he said. 
“Only it’s too late for the hospital. 
I’m going to the church.” 

“Gosh, preacher!” breathed Rufe, 
wide-eyed behind Andy Quam in the 
shifting auroral lights. “Never thought 
he*d say that!” 

“Never would,” rumbled the Reef- 
er, “if I had the choice. Knew it was 
coming. Your robot inspector told 
me weeks ago. ‘Malignant fusorian 
virus,’ he said, and he acted like he 
was enjoying it — much as a robot 
can enjoy anything. And he said the 
Visitants could clear it up, but no 
doctor could. Expect he’s right.” 

“So you’re joining Almalik,” said 
Andy Quam. 

The Reefer shrugged bitterly and 
winced from his slimg arm. “I’ve 
tamed my last sleeth. My free life’s 
ended.” A spasm of pain whitened 
his face beneath the scars and the 
dirty beard. “Don’t think I like it, 
Quamodian! But half my body’s on 
fire.” 

“Good!” cried Andy Quam. 
“That’s fine! Now, if you want a ride 
to Wisdom Creek, you can start pay- 
ing the fare!” 

The boy gasped, and even Cloth- 
ilde Kwai Kwich darted a sudden in- 
credulous look at Quamodian. The 
Reefer licked his lips, staring at 
Quamodian. “What’re you talking 
about? I’m too sick for jokes!” 
“That’s good, because I’m not 
joking. I’m going to leave you here 
to rot — unless you make it worth 
my while to take you in,” 

“How?” 



ROGUE STAR

“Easiest thing in the world,” Qna- 
tnodian said tightly. “Let’s just start 
by telling me the truth abmt what 
you and Cliff Hawk were doing.” 

U nder the many-hued gleam of the 
auroras the Reefer’s, eyes gleam- 
ed whitely, furiously. If he had had 
the transcience powers of the sleeth 
Andreas Quamodian would have been 
stunned or dead in that moment. 
There was madness in his look, and 
a rage that could destroy planets. 

But it passed. The Reefer looked 
away. His jaws worked; he gulped, 
spat a thin black stream of the juice 
of his root and said: 

“Why not? Makes no difference 
any more, does it? After all, the Vis- 
itants will soon be burrowing in my 
brain and exposing all my secrets for 
Almalik to know. Might as well tell 
you now as have you find out that 
way . but let me sit down in your 
flyer, Quamodian. I’m telling the 
truth about being sick.” 

Andy Quam opened the bubble for 
him, and painfully the huge man 
sank into the cushions. The autonom- 
ic circuits of the flyer compensated 
for his weight, and he sat bobbing 
slightly, looking down on them. 

“Truth is,” he said, “Cliff Hawk 
was only working for me. Insolent 
pup! I knew he thought he was pret- 
ty high and mighty, chasing after 
pure knowledge and all that stuff. 
But all J wanted was a cure for this 
virus. Ever since I picked it up on 
the Reefs, more’n twenty years ago, 
it’s been sleeping there inside me. I 
didn’t mean for it to kill me, Quamo- 
dian. But I didn’t mean to take on 
the Visitants, either.” 



He soothed his splinted arm with 
rough, blunt fingers, staring up at the 
many-hued sky. “I did like some of 
the things the Visitants had to offer, 
of course. Physical immortality, just 
about. A cure for this fusorian poi- 
son. Power . The rogues were my 
way of getting those things, without 
letting those parasites into my body. 
Hawk was just my engineer.” 

“So you knew Cliff Hawk was 
creating a rogue?” Quamodian leaned 
forward to search the Reefer’s lax 
and bloodless face. 

“Two rogues, Quamodian. The 
first got away.” He grinned with a 
spasm of pain. “Looks like the other 
one did too!” 

“I see,” whispered Andy Quam, 
staring up at the angry aurora. “The 
first one entered our sun. Now it’s 
rogue too!” 

The Reefer shrugged. 

Clothilde Kwai Kwich cried: 
“Monitor Quamodian! This must be 
reported at once. Since our citizens 
are not 'n contact with Almalik, we 
must return immediately to Wisdom 
Creek and report via the transflex 
station there.” 

“It’s been reported already,” said 
Andy Quam. 

“Impossible! How could it be? We 
just found out — ” 

“By Rufe’s parents. They knew 
about it, didn’t they?” The boy nod- 
ded, looking pleased and excited. 
“And they’ve gone to Nuevo York to 
pass the word along.” 

The Reefer scratched his ribs cau- 
tiously, winced and groaned: “So 
that’s about it, right? Now how about 
taking me in to Wisdom Creek?” 
“Not just yet,” said Andy Quam, 

IF

deadly quiet. “One more question. 
What about Molly Zaldivar?” 

“That witless little thing! She ruin- 
ed Cliff Hawk. In love with her, he 
was; she tried to stop him and mess- 
ed everything up.” 

He gasped and leaned forward, 
clutching his chest. “But I don’t 
know where she is now, Quamodian,” 
he moaned. “Please! Isn’t that 
enough? Won’t you take me in be- 
fore this thing kills me?” 

O n the way in to Wisdom Creek 
Andy Quam used the flyer’s cir- 
cuits to contact the control dome for 
priorities. “Thirty-minute delay on all 
messages, Monitor Quamodian,” said 
the dome. “I will inform you when 
your circuits can be cleared.” 

Grim-lipped, Andy Quam ordered 
the flyer to the Starchurch. Now that 
he knew what was wrong with the 
sun his responsibility was at an end. 
Almalik would cope with the prob- 
lem — somehow — or Almalik would 
fail; Quamodian didn’t care. At that 
moment the only thing on his mind 
was Molly Zaldivar, stolen into space 
by the rogue and doomed to early 
death by the lethal rays of the old 
power source in the cavern. As for 
the Reefer, Quamodian didn’t care 
in the slightest whether he lived or 
died. 

Yet there was a sort of grandeur 
in what happened at the Starchurch. 
They were greeted by the new robot 
inspector, his egg-shaped black body 
bobbing with excitement at the pres- 
ence of so many illustrious visitors. 
Even though this was not a Starday, 
a circle of the saved were kneeling on 
that wide floor beneath the imaged 



suns of Almalik, and Quamodian and 
Monitor Clothilde Kwai Kwich led 
the procession that brought the limp- 
ing, sullen figure of the Reefer to the 
Visitants. Behind him the carnivor- 
ous citizen, the green-spiral citizen 
and the cloud brought up the rear. 

The kneeling worshippers chanted 
their praises of Almalik. Then Juan 
Zaldivar stood up to ask the Reefer 
the statutory questions — if he un- 
derstood the nature of symbiotic life; 
if he had chosen of his own free 
will to accept the fusorian symbiotes 
in his body, blood, brain and bone; 
if he understood that this choice was 
made forever. 

To each question, the Reefer 
croaked, “I do.” 

He knelt, and the inhabited saved 
ones knelt with him, their golden 
brands glowing in the gloom. They 
chanted again, their voices rolling 
solemnly against the mighty dome 
that held the thirteen suns of Alma- 
lik. 

The Reefer gasped a sudden pro- 
testing cry. 

He rose half to his feet, turned 
with a sudden look of wild alarm, 
then pitched forward on his damag- 
ed arm. 

Quamodian heard a sharp, hissing 
crackle. Fine golden sparks were 
dancing up from the glowing marks 
on the bodies and faces of the saved 
ones, floating delicately toward the 
prone body of the Reefer. They flew 
together, gathering into a tiny cloud 
of golden fire that hovered over him. 

The yellow fireball sank hissing 
into his skin. 

An arm of it darted around his 
body, touched his cheek, retreated to

rejoin the rest. The air was suddenly 
heavy with the sweet reek of the Vis- 
itants. 

The Reefer’s moans subsided. 

Then the chanting ended. He stir- 
red, opened his eyes, stood up easily 
and came to shake Andreas Quamo- 
dian’s hand. 

“Thanks, friend,” his great voice 
boomed. A serene and gentle smile 
had fallen over his scarred, ferocious 
face. The star of the Visitants now 
glowed faintly above his ragged 
beard. “All my pain is gone.” 

Juan Zaldivar came to take his 
hand. “You are saved now. You’ll 
feel no pain again,” he said solemnly. 

T he control dome had been in 
touch with Almalik. But there 
were difficulties. Quamodian blazed: 
“What difficulties? I must communi- 
cate with Almalik at once — go there 
as soon as possiblel” 

“Regret,” sang the control dome 
sweetly. “It is a matter of priorities.” 
“That’s what I demand, emergen- 
cy priority!” 

“But Monitor Quamodian,” sang 
the control dome, “when you arrived 
yesterday you stated the emergency 
was here.” 

“It was here. Now I have new 
facts! I expect a most serious danger 
to the suns of Almalik!” 

Clothilde Kwai Kwich whispered, 
“Andy, may I speak to him? Per- 
haps he will listen — ” But Quamo- 
dian froze her with a glare. She sub- 
sided without comment. She had be- 
come a softer, more feminine person 
since the visit to the cave, the discov- 
ery that Andy Quam’s fears were not 
groundless. 



“State these facts,” the monitor 
rapped out melodiously. 

“They are already available to Al- 
malik,” said Quamodian. “They ex- 
ist in the mind of a man called the 
Reefer who has just received the 
Visitants. I wish to be on hand 
among the stars of Almalik, to assist 
with the interpretation and use of 
this new information.” 

He did not add his more urgent 
private reason; it would have been of 
no use, since it was not the sort of 
thing that would influence the con- 
trol dome’s transcience patterns. But 
he clung to a wild, despairing hope 
that Molly Zaldivar might appear 
with her captor, somewhere about the 
multiple suns of Almalik. If she did, 
Quamodian wanted to be there. 

“Moment,” sang the monitor 
dome. Andy Quam shifted uneasily 
in the seat of the flyer. 

Clothilde Kwai Kwich frowned 
thoughtfully. **We have priorities,” 
she stated, as if to no one. 

“What about it?” Quam demand- 
ed. 

“Nothing, Andy. Except that the 
fest of us can go to Almalik at once 
and plead your cause.” 

“Agree,” chanted the chorus of the 
grass-green spirals. “Impatient. Ur- 
gent. Suggest no delay.” 

And the cloud citizen sighed, 
“There exist great forces deployed 
against Almalik. It is necessary to 
prepare immediately.” 

Quamodian said stubbornly, “Do 
what you like. / am going anyway.” 
Clothilde looked at him doubtfully, 
but said nothing. She was saved the 
need to, anyway; the control dome 
spoke in all their ears, through the 



146 



IP 




very little communicator plugs: 
“Monitor Quamodian, your request 
is denied. Monitor Kwai Kwich, your 
priorities, and those of your party, 
are withdrawn. There can be no 
travel to that destination now.” 

T he news struck them all with 
consternation. The green spirals 
whirled furiously in their interlocking 
orbits, their collective thoughts a 
babble of whispered fear and excite- 
ment, just below the threshold of 
comprehensibility for the others. The 
predator citizen whined mournfully 
and edged closer to the boy, Rufe, 
who stared wide-eyed at Andy Quam. 
The pinkly glowing cloud citizen 
whispered somber statements about 
the disasters that lay ahead, and 
Clothilde Kwai Kwich’s hand crept 
out, unnoticed, to take the hand of 
Andy Quam. 

“Why?” he demanded furiously, 
“We are monitorsi We cannot be 
denied priority rights!” 

“All priorities are withdrawn,” 
said the control dome somberly. 
“Our headquarters report anomalous 
astronomical phenomena among the 
planets and multiple suns of Almalik. 
Robot inspector, please clarify.” 
Unnoticed the black egg-shaped 
form of the robot had drifted across 
the square toward them. Its oval sen- 
sor was cool and bright and blank. 
Its high voice hummed: “That is 
correct. Monitor Quamodian. The 
outer planet of Almalik Thirteen has 
suddenly stopped in its orbit. It is 
moving toward collision toward its 
primary at many times the normal 
acceleration of gravity.” 

Quamodian’s eyes narrowed. In- 



side his mind whirled with chaotic 
flashes of foreboding. Molly was 
there! He was certain of it now, and 
certain that he must get to her. “Not 
surprising!” he barked, surprising 
himself. “That is precisely what I 
hoped to prevent! I must get there 
at once to limit the damage, avoid it 
if I still can.” 

“Impossible, Monitor Quamodian,” 
the robot whirred. “The collision of 
the anomalous planet with Almalik 
Thirteen is expected to occur within 
a few hours. All transflex facilities 
are in use for the evacuation of the 
threatened planets. Even so, they are 
inadequate. Only a fraction of the 
population can be saved. Under these 
circumstances, no incoming travel is 
permitted.” 

The girl gasped, next to Andy 
Quam in the seat of the flyer. The 
predator citizen lifted his snout and 
emitted a long, mourning howl. 

Quamodian stammered, “But — 
but I must go there! To help! It is 
still possible to do something . .” 

The robot did not respond. Its 
bright black case hung motionless. 

Rufe whispered fearfully, “Preach- 
er, what’s the matter? Is it dead?” 

Quamodian shook his head, star- 
ing. The robot’s plasma sensor flick- 
ered, darkened, went out. Three thick 
black effector whips slid out of its 
body shell and dangled limply below 
it, brushing the dusty pavement of 
the square. 

“Robot inspector?” Quamodian 
called querulously. Beside him the 
girl whispered: 

“There’s something terribly wrong! 
It’s out of communication entire- 
ly .. .” 



ROGUE STAR 



147 




But abruptly the effectors snapped 
back into the case. The sensor glow- 
ed again. 

“We have received a further in- 
struction from headquarters,” it hum- 
med. “The information states that a 
p#werful rogue invader has destroyed 
the native intellects in two of the suns 
of Almalik. The invader has estab- 
lished its own tran science patterns in 
these suns, and it is now attacking 
the planets of Almalik Thirteen.” 

Quamodian caught a sudden, rasp- 
ing breath. 

“Call Cygnus!” he demanded. 

“Sacred Almalik, spokesman star 
of Cygnus, is calling here,” the ro- 
bot’s high whine interrupted him. 
“Your transflex travel priority has 
been approved. You and your party 
may depart from the Wisdom Creek 
transflex station at once.” 

XIX 

L ight-years away, the rogue’s con- 
sciousness grew and sharpened 
in the heat of a cosmic fury. The 
huge sentience of stripped electrons 
and plasma soliloquized to itself like 
a stellar Hamlet: 

My seas boil dry . my magma 
bleeds from glowing wounds . my 
core itself is shattered by those sav^ 
age plasma spears . still I hurl my^ 
self toward the great white sun 
ahead .... 

The inner planets of the sun spread 
wiifer in their orbits as it approached. 
They began flashing backward past 
it; it was only hours now until they, 
aad all the space about, would be 
dissolved in the blazing debris of the 
nuL the rogue was about to destroy. 



And still the sun did not resist. 

Swelling vast ahead of the rogue, 
it lay serenely white, beautiful and 
quiet, undisturbed by the rogue’s at- 
tack. 

By now the rogue was ancient and 
mature, in its own terms at least; it 
had existed and learned through bil- 
lions of cycles of its picosecond re- 
flexes. It had learned a full comple- 
ment of “emotions,” or at any rate 
of those polarizing tropisms which 
did for it what the glandular by- 
products called emotions did for hu- 
man beings. It had learned anger, 
and the calm pride of the target sun 
called forth anger in the rogue: 

If it would only recognize me! If 
it would only admit causing the sun 
of Earth to strike at me! If it would 
offer some apology for deceiving me, 
for its contempt of me . then per- 
haps yet I could stop my blow . 

But it ignored him. 

The rogue was not entirely ignor- 
ed. Though the great white star blaz- 
ed on passionlessly, benevolently, still 
the rogue found itself the target for 
great forces from elsewhere. Another 
sun of Almalik had joined the attack 
upon it. The blue companion of the 
golden giant stabbed at it with a 
twisting shaft of plasma, a monstrous 
snake of glowing ions and transcience 
energy, which pierced to the rogue’s 
heart, withdrew and jabbed again. 

An agony of meta-pain jolted the 
rogue to its innermost plasma swirl; 
but it was not destroyed. It gathered 
its forces and sought for a weapon to 
hurl back the thrust of the blue star. 

And it found one. Passing by the 
great fifth planet of the unresisting 
white sun, the rogue reached out with 



148 



IF 




:s p);isma arms to snatch a string of 
r.onns. It gathered them to itself, 
III ed their shattered mass into its 
own body, linked their electrons into 
its transcience patterns. With its new 
mass it strengthened its defenses. 

And secure in its new strength, it 
drew more strength from the attack- 
ing stars themselves. It sucked their 
transcience energies, through the blue 
bolts and the golden ones, tightened 
its transflection fields and hurled its 
new mass always faster toward the 
maddening white star that glowed on, 
contemptuous of all the rogue could 
do. 

And that phase of the battle ended. 

T hough the rogue had never struck 
back at the twin attacking gi- 
ants, they were beaten. 

Their plasma coils had exhausted 
even their giant strength. The coils 
withdrew, collapsed, disintegrated. 
The blue giant shrank and dimmed; 
its golden companion swelled and 
reddened. 

And then they were both dead. 
Their fusion fires still blazed on — 
but mindlessly, now; the intellects 
that had animated them were drain- 
ed empty. 

Sentience had fled from them. An- 
ger and fear and purpose had gone. 
The blue star swelled again, the gold- 
en companion shrank back to normal 
size; they had become merely globes 
of reacting nuclear gas, normal atom- 
ic engines no longer controlled by 
any transcience intellect. 

It was a clear victory for the ro- 
gue . but his major enemy, the 
bright white star in his path, was still 
the same. 

ROGUE STAR 



It was not defeated. If it was even 
threatened, it gave no sign. 

The rogue felt its vast quiet mind 
watching, alert but strangely unafraid. 
It was anomalous, the rogue consid- 
ered, that the target star did not re- 
quest mercy, or a discussion of terms. 
Anomalous — and somehow disturb- 
ing. 

But the rogue would not be deter- 
red from its purpose. It plunged on 
to smash the white star and its 
haughty pride. It sought and foupd 
new fuel for its vengeance. Passing 
a cloud of asteroids, it swept them 
up and added them to its mass. It 
reached ahead to gather in the barren 
satellite of the fourth planet and 
crushed and fused the new mass into 
its own as it sought to crush and fuse 
all the suns of Almalik. 

Already in anticipation, it tasted 
the acrid joy of victory and destruc- 
tion. 

Thirteen suns would die or be 
driven to mindless burning. A hun- 
dred planets and a thousand inhab- 
ited worldlets would be destroyed. A 
million million living things would 
go up in white-hot plasma as the stars 
died .... 

And among them, thought the ro- 
gue with a bleak stab of pain, would 
be the trivial living blob of organi2^d 
matter called Molly Zaldivar. 

/ do not wish Molly Zaldivar to 
die. She must die. I will not save her. 
But I do not wish her to die, because 
I love her. 

In its deadly plunge toward the 
white star it sent thin threads of plas- 
ma effectors ahead to seek her out. 
Its sensor filaments ranged the cubic 
miles of void and found her at last, 

149 





150

still on the sleeth, far ahead of the 
rogue and dropping toward the at- 
mosphere of the third planet. The 
arm of the golden giant that had 
freed her from the rogue was gone 
now, with its master’s death; but 
Molly Zaldivar still lived. 

And felt the rogue’s delicate ten- 
dril-touch. 

She looked up, unerringly toward 
the point in space where his massed 
energies were driving the planet down 
to its primary. “Monster?” she 
whispered. 

The rogue was silent. It merely 
watched, and listened. 

“Monster,” she said, more confi- 
dent now, “I know you’re there. I 
don’t mind.” 

She was silent for a moment, lean- 
ing forward over the sleek black skin 
of the sleeth, staring toward the 
cloudy world below. *‘You’ve done 
so much harm, monster,” she sighed. 
“I wish .... And yet you’ve tried to 
be good to me. Monster, I’m so sorry 
that you must make war on Alma- 
lik!” 

The rogue did not answer. But it 
probed her interior spectrum of 
thoughts and energies, registered the 
dark shadow of sadness and, with it, 
a pale golden glow of — of what? 
Love? Fondness at least, the rogue 
considered. 

It contracted its tendril to the 
merest whisper, content only to ob- 
serve her, while it considered. Its 
strength was so immeasurably greater 
than her own that it could lift her 
from the sleeth in an instant. The 
energies that had hurled planets about 
and slain stars could fold both her 
and the sleeth back into its own fus- 



ed and glowing mass effortlessly, 
carrying them with it into the colH- 
sion with the proud white star ahead. 

But it did not. 

It watched her carefully, but with- 
out interfering, as she darted, secure 
in the sleeth’s shimmering transflec- 
tion fields, into the ionized border- 
layers of the third planet’s atmos- 
phere and dropped swiftly toward 
the cities on its surface. 

The third planet was a blue-green 
world and beautiful. It was a world 
of peaceful seas and friendly conti- 
nents. Dazzling cities dwelt along its 
oceans and rivers, inhabited by all the 
many kinds of creatures that were 
companions of Almalik. 

The rogue watched her drop into 
the towering spires of one of the 
cities. It was not yet too late; it 
could sweep her up even there, and 
bring her back in the effortless recoil 
of one of its plasma arms. 

But it stayed its energies. It merely 
watched, as it drove on toward the 
collision, now little more than an 
hour off, which would sear and melt 
this world, and destroy the organized 
mass of matter that was Molly Zaldi- 
var. 

XX 

T he flyer, with its organic passen- 
gers and trailed by the green 
spirals and the pink-cloud citizen, 
fell endlessly through the transflec- 
tion distances and emerged into the 
exit port on Kaymar, crown city of 
the planet of Kaymar, central world 
of Almalik. 

Clothilde Kwai Kwich’s hand 
tightened in consternation on Andy

IF 




Quam’s arm. Beside him the boy 
gasped: “Preacher! Looks like we’ve 
come to a bad place!” 

The great central dome of the city 
seethed with citizens of all kinds. 
Many were human, in this central 
city of the worlds of Almalik, calm 
Terrestrials, bronzed giants from the 
Reefs. But there were citizens in a 
myriad of shapes and in no shapes 
at all, liquid citizens and gaseous citi- 
zens, citizens that had no form of 
matter to clothe the bare energies 
that constituted their beings. The dia- 
phragm of the transflex cube behind 
them was already contracting on a 
full load of refugees lucky enough to 
be on their way to some other world. 
The shouts, cries, hissing whistles, 
electronic pulses' and other sounds of 
the countless thousands who had not 
yet been so lucky added up to a vast 
chorus of pleas for help. Twenty 
crystal citizens hung just before them, 
their razor-sharp edges of bright blue 
transparency flashing in the suns of 
Alm^ik. Quam dropped the flyer to 
the ramp, opened the door and led 
the way, ducking under the crystal 
citizens. 

“Got to get out of this crush,” he 
panted. “Headquarters of the Com- 
panions of the Star is just over here 
— I think — ” 

Clothilde Kwai Kwich cried breath- 
lessly, “Yes, Andy! They’ll still be 
functioning; we’ll go there, and — ” 
But she had no breath to finish. It 
was all they could do to urge their 
way through the incredible press of 
citizens. There was neither violence 
nor outright panic; those were not the 
enemies. But there were so many of 
them, so many countless thousands 



more than the transflex cube could 
evacuate in the few score minutes 
left, and backed by so many thou- 
sands of thousands more that had not 
yet managed to make their way even 
into the central dome of the city. 
They were orderly. They were brave. 
But each of them knew that most of 
them were doomed. 

They fought their way to a clear 
space and paused for breath. The 
carnivore citizen was the least affect- 
ed of them; he glanced at young Rufe 
and bayed a laughing comment which 
the translators in Quamodian’s ear 
rendered as: “Let the cub ride my 
shoulders! We’ll never make it any 
other way.” 

“Naw!” flamed Rufe. “I can keep 
up if you can. Come on, preacher, 
let’s do what we came to do!” 

The pinkly glowing cloud citizen 
was the worst damaged of the party. 
Little cloudlets of his material had 
been detached; some were still float- 
ing after him, rejoining the central 
mass of his being; others were hope- 
lessly lost in the crush behind them. 
The grass-green spirals had merely 
tightened their orbits, maintaining ex- 
act spacing and speeds. 

“All right,” said Andy Quam. 
“Let’s go!” 

But a great shout from the dome 
behind them made them turn. 

Every citizen, warm-blooded or 
cold, humanoid or anmrphous, was 
staring upward, through the crystal 
ceiling of the dome, with ten thou- 
sand thousand eyes, photoreceptors, 
radar scanners, sensors of every de- 
scription. 

There, streaked like a child’s bright 
daub on the calm blue skies of Kay- 



ROGUE STAR

mar, hung the bright and glittering 
globe of the invading rogue star. 
Lightnings played about its blazing 
body as it shot across the sky, its 
motion visible even though its dis- 
tance was many millions of miles. 

Andy Quam tore his eyes away. 
“Come on,” he muttered. “We’ve got 
even less time than I thought.” 

T he Grand Hall of the Compan- 
ions of the Star was empty. The 
thirteen suns of Almalik blazed down 
from the ceiling on an auditorium 
that could seat thousands, and now 
held no one at all. 

Monitor Clothilde Kwai Kwich 
said dolefully: “I can’t understand. I 
thought here at least we’d find some- 
one who could help — ” 

The chant of the grass-green spi- 
rals sounded in Andy Quam’s ears: 
“No indications! No operative func- 
tions being performed! This construct 
not inhabited!” 

The boy clutched Quamodian’s 
arm. “But preacher,” he said. “Alma- 
lik told us to come here. Didn’t he?” 
Quamodian said, “He gave us per- 
mission. Directly. Yes.” He turned, 
searching the vast room with his eyes. 
“But perhaps something has happen- 
ed.” 

The weary sigh of the cloud citi- 
zen whispered: “There exists a large- 
scale entity which is observing us.” 
Quamodian flung himself into a 
chair, trying to think. Time was so 
short! He had counted on finding the 
order of Companions of the Star still 
functioning. Perhaps it had not been 
realistic, but in his mind he had ex- 
pected to find the great hall thronged 
with worshippers, the many offices 



and administrative sections busy 
about the endless tasks of Almalik. If 
he had thought at all, he had thought 
that a robot monitor or a citizen 
would have greeted them at the en- 
trance, led them directly to someone 
in supreme authority, received his 
information about the rogue — and 
acted. Acted in time to save this 
world, and all the world of Almalik. 

He had not expected that the build- 
ing would be empty. 

The others were waiting quietly for 
him to act. He realized that, right or 
wrong, he would have to make the 
decisions for all of them. And there 
was less time with every passing 
clock-tick .... 

He stood up. “All right,” he said, 
“we’ll go back to the transflex cube. 
Perhaps the monitors there can help 
us.” 

“Through that mob, preacher? Im- 
possible!” cried the boy. 

“Impossible or not, that’s what 
we’ll have to do. Unless you have a 
better idea — ” 

But then, as they turned to leave, 
a Voice rumbled softly in their ears. 

“Wait,” it said. 

They froze where they stood. The 
girl looked imploringly at Andy 
Quam. She did not speak, but her 
lips formed a word: “Almalik?” 

He nodded; and the Voice spoke 
again: 

“Behold,” it said, and the great 
dome lifted on its transflection forces 
to reveal the splendor of the heavens 
themselves. It was daytime now; the 
glittering stars that the dome was de- 
signed to reveal could not be seen. 
But the bright smear of the invader 
was there, blighting the beauty of the 



154 



IF 




calm clouds. And near it in the sky, 
dropping toward them — 

“It’s Miss Zaldivar!” shouted the 
boy. “Look, preacher! It’s her and 
the sleeth!” 

r iey were in that great hall for 
less than a quarter of an hour, 
and in all that time Quamodian could 
not after remember taking a breath- 
He was overpowered by the immense 
majesty of Almalik himself, brooding 
over them, watching and helping. 
Even the nearness of the girl he had 
crossed half a universe to find could 
not break him free from the spell of 
that immortal and immense star. 

Though what was said was surely 
catastrophic enough to rouse him to 
action; for Molly Zaldivar, she said, 
was dying. 

“Dear Andy,” she whispered across 
the vast gulf of the chamber, her 
vcHce warm and affectionate in his 
ears. “No! Don’t come any closer to 
me. I’m charged with radiations, 
Andy dear — the old ones from the 
Plan of Man madiines, new ones diat 
our little monster-star used to try to 
save my life. Or to give me life again; 
because I was dead. Anyway, if you 
come near me now it will be ycmr 
death ” 

Even so, he rose to run toward 
her; but she stopped him with her 
hand. “Please,” she whispered. “Now. 
What was it that you came from 
Earth to tell?” 

He stammered out the story the 
Reefer had told him, while Clothilde 
Kwai Kwich and the boy, one on 
each side of him, stood silent and 
awed. Molly Zaldivar listened grave- 
ly, her face composed though her 



eyes widened, then danced, as she 
saw how Clothilde’s hand sought his. 

Then she said, “Thank you, Andy. 
You’ve always been the best friend I 
could ever hope to have. I — ” 

Hep composure almost broke for 
a moment, but she controlled herself, 
and smiled. “I don’t mind leaving 
this world much, dear Andy. But I 
do mind leaving you.” 

And then she was gone, mounting 
once more toward the sky on the 
great, patient back of the sleeth, 
while the enormous dome of Alma- 
lik swung majestically back into 
place to blot her out. 

XXI 

Qomething had happened. The ro- 
gue’s thin thread of sensor had 
been snapped; it had lost Molly 
Zaldivar and ^r sleeth. 

It tried to find them again for 
many picoseccmds, but in vain. Some 
force larger than itself had shut her 
off, blinded it to her activities. A 
sense that in a human mi^t have 
been called fmreboding filled the ro- 
gue; but it had not time for even 
meta-emotions; it was driving ever 
closer to its enemy sun, and it needed 
all its forces for the task ahead. 

The third planet had fallen far be- 
hind it now. It flashed through the 
orbit of the second planet, now hid- 
den from it at inferior conjunction 
by the expanding white sun. The 
great white disk grew ahead of it. 

Still the star ignores my attack. It 

refuses to resist. It offers no apology 
for the attacks it has made on me 
through its lesser stars. Still it is 
watching . mocking me ... 



ROGUE STAR 



155 




“Monster! Stop for me. Now!” 

The thin filament of the rogue’s 
probing sensor was alive again, car- 
rying a message for it. The rogue en- 
ergized its perceptions and ^aw that 
Molly Zaldivar was pursuing, racing 
after it on the black and shining 
sleeth. There was a power flowing 
from her that the rogue could not 
quite recognize, but that made it un- 
easy, unsure of itself. The feeble hu- 
man frame of organized matter that 
was the girl should not have been 
able to dispose such powers. Not even 
with the energies the rogue itself had 
bestowed on her; not though her life 
was close to an end, and all her ac- 
cumulated strengths were being dis- 
posed at once. 

The rogue considered for some 
nanoseconds the possibility that these 
forces came from its enemy, Alma- 
lik. But it dismissed the possibility. 
It simply did not matter. Contact was 
only minutes away. Already the thin 
solar atmosphere was boiling around 
it. It did not stop, perhaps could not 
stop; the gathered mass of its plan- 
etary body was plunging too fast to 
be diverted now. 

But it sent a message through its 
plasma effector, shaking the thin at- 
mosphere that the sleeth carried with 
it through space. “What do you 
want, Molly Zaldivar?” its tiny voice 
piped. “Do you love me now?” 

Her answer sent a seismic tremor 
through the core of the planet it had 
made its body: “Love you, monster? 
I don’t know. I cannot imagine it. 
And yet — yes, perhaps I do. If it 
matters . .” 

The rogue shook in its mad plunge. 
Its boiling seas loosed huge clouds of 



vapor as, for a moment, its grasp 
slackened; lightnings played through 
its tortured skies. But Molly was “still 
speaking: 

“But I have no life left to love 
anyone, monster. My body is dying, 
and I must tell you something. Mon- 
ster! Please listen. Almalik is not your 
enemy y 

A shock of doubt shattered the ro- 
gue’s great joy. 

“Listen, monster! Almalik never 
hurt you. Almalik has renounced all 
violence. He could not harm you, nor 
any sentient thing. Ever!” 

R age shook the rogue now. The 
crustal rocks of its planetary 
body snapped, and white-hot magma 
spewed forth. In the air around Mol- 
ly Zaldivar its tiny voice shrieked: 
“Lies! Lies again! The sun of Earth 
that tried to kill me was Almalik’s 
vassal! Its twin stars that tried to kill 
me again — they were Almalik’s 
companions!” 

But Molly Zaldivar’s voice came 
strongly: “No, monster. I lied to you 
once, yes. Because I was afraid of 
you. But Almalik has never lied, nor 
has he tried to harm you. The sun of 
Earth that struck you — it was your 
own brother!” 

The rogue called back the huge ef- 
fector that it had lashed out to strike 
her. Puzzled, its shrill voice repeated, 
“Brother?” 

“Yes, your brother! Another syn- 
thetic sentience, made before you. It 
occupied the sun of Earth and tried 
to destroy you — came here before 
you, and tried to destroy you again 
through the twin stars of Almalik. 
But you defeated it, monster. And 



156 



IF 




now it is gone, and you must stop 
before you destroy great Almalik!” 

The rogue paused, while its sen- 
tient plasma revolved the startling 
new concept. “Brother?” its tiny 
voice whispered again. A dreadful 
doubt shivered through its core. 

If it were wrong, it thought ... if 
it were wrong, then it was doing a 
dreadful and irrevocable deed. 

For if it were wrong, then Almalik 
had always been its friend. And it 
was within minutes of destroying Al- 
malik forever. 

Methodically, patiently, the rogue 
rebuilt its net of sensors, threw out 
probes to scan the patient white star 
before it — so close now, and so vul- 
nerable! — and all of space around. 
Its velocity, hard driven and acceler- 
ated through hundreds of millions of 
miles, was huge. Unstoppable. It had 
thrown its energies in profligate 
abandon into thrusting the dead plan- 
et toward the white star. It was sim- 
ply too late to stop. 

With care and speed it calculated 
possible trajectories to divert its own 
plunge, not to stop it — for that was 
utterly impossible now — but simply 
to deflect it enough to miss the star 
and plunge on into the dark space 
beyond .... 

Impossible. It was too late. 

Well, then: to pass through the 
star’s corona, destroying itself in the 
process, of course, and working great 
havoc with the star’s internal energy 
balance, but leaving most of it in- 
tact .... 

Also impossible. Also too late. 

In what passed in it for despera- 
tion, the rogue computed its chance 
of plunging through the skin of the 



star but on a tangent that would miss 
the core, leave the star wounded and 
erupting with enormous violence, but 
perhaps not entirely destroyed .... 

Also impossible, and finally impos- 
sible. Its energies were too great, its 
time of collision too near. It would 
strike the white sun almost dead on, 
whatever the rogue did now. And ro- 
gue and white star together would 
erupt in the ultimate violence of a 
supernova, destroying themselves and 
everything for a light-year or more 
around. 

/ regret, thought the rogue. I feel 
pity. For Molly Zaldivar. For Alma- 
lik, For all the myriads of beings on 
Almalik's doomed planets. And for 
me. 

It sent out a message on the thin, 
stretched filament of energy with 
which it had been in contact with 
Molly Zaldivar, to say that there was 
no longer any hope. 

But it could not make contact. 

Once again it searched all of space 
nearby, seeking Molly Zaldivar and 
the sleeth. Uselessly. Somehow, Mol- 
ly Zaldivar was gone. 

T he patterns of energy that made 
up the essential beings of the 
rogue were shaken with grief and 
pain. Despairing, it thrust with all the 
energies it possessed at the calm 
white disk of its target sun, now so 
near and vulnerable. Great spouts of 
flame boiled from the star below it; 
the rogue’s own planetary body split 
and shattered in the violence of its 
effort to undo what it had done. But 
it was no use. The fragments of its 
planet, continental in size, massive as 
worldlets themselves drove on. 



ROGUE STAR 



157 




Look, little one. Take that blue 
star. Use its energies, if you will. 

The rogue darted out sensors in all 
directions, seeking the source of that 
soundless, gentle voice. The sensors 
found nothing. But the rogue knew 
where it came from: it was Almalik, 
speaking to him from the enormous, 
swelling, flame-ringed solar disk so 
near below. 

The blue star? 

Experimentally the rogue threw 
out a sensor toward it. It was empty, 
untenanted since it had destroyed the 
mad sentience that had inhabited it. 
It was waiting for it. 

Something helped the rogue, some- 
thing to which it could not put a 
name: not merely Almalik, not just 
the star it was so close to destroying, 
but a congeries of sentiences, a pool- 
ed strength of living and stellar crea- 
tures, all urging the rogue on, sup- 
porting it, giving it help. 

It drove along the lines of its sen- 
sor and entered into the waiting star. 

New energies flooded its webs of 
sentience. The resources of a giant 
stellar furnace were now its own to 
command. 

It reached out to the planet it had 
abandoned, hurtling down on the 
white star, grasped it with the mighty 
plasma arms of its new body. White 
arms from Almalik himself joined 
the rogue — and with them, golden 
arms. The rogue puzzled over that 
for a few electron-orbits; surely the 
golden star was dead. 

Yet it was taking part. The golden 
arms linked with the blue and white 
ones, and together, smoothly, strong- 
ly, with infinite speed they pulled 
the planet aside. 



The planet did not survive those 
mighty forces; it crumbled into a mil- 
lion million fragments, streaming past 
the great white orb of Almalik and 
heading out into space on cometary 
orbits. 

But it had missed. Almalik was 
safe. 

And the rogue had time to realize 
what it had gained, in the might of 
its new stellar body . and what it 
had lost. 

T he great tolling chorus of the 
st^rs welcomed it into brother- 
hood. Join us, brother, said a great 
collective voice. Be one with us. Be 
one with all things that share the 
bonds of mind. Be one with Almalik. 

And a part of the rogue rejoiced, 
and a part of it ached with an un- 
practiced grief for Molly Zaldivar, 
doomed to death in her frail human 
body, lost forever. 

The slow, gentle voice held a hint 
of amusement and wry pity. Look, 
brother, it said. You gave her your 
strength. We gave her our empty sun 
for a home. 

And the rogue struck out, unbe- 
lieving, with a bright blue plasma 
sensor toward the golden star; and it 
met the rogue’s sensor with one of 
its own. Gold thread and blue touch- 
ed and joined, while the stars watch- 
ed and rejoiced. 

The voice that spoke to the rogue 
was not a human voice, but there 
was something of humanity about it 
— something soft and merry, some- 
thing very like the voice of Molly 
Zaldivar, and dear. 

“Hello, monster,” it said. “Wel- 
come. Welcome forever.” END

HUE 

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

I would like to make a few pos- 
sibly volatile comments in rebuff to 
Mrs. Wills’ letter in the March issue 
of IFy which ran down everything 
in your magazine from stories (with 
great misinterpretations) to authors 
and ending with the advertisements 
— all of these supposedly being hor- 
ribly detrimental to children and 
teenagers. 

It is quite obvious that Mrs. Wills 
is not a reader that you would be 
sorry to lose. After all, I hope that 
science fiction magazines continue 
to be for thinking people of all ages, 
which unfortunately does not include 
radicals, reactionaries and Bible- 
belters. I thought that most of those 
people were in the South, although 
I notice that Mrs. Wills lives in 
Michigan. 

What would Mrs. Wills have teen- 
agers read? — Argosy, Playboy, etc.. 
True Confessions, etc. etc.??? 

Personally, I am very glad that 
my almost teenager has shown an 
interest (even though rather slight 
so far, but hopefully it will expand 
with age) in science fiction. It helps 
give her an insight into the possible 
future and helps her have a mind 
that will probably be much more 
open in its thinking to all of the 
problems that arise in the world. 



and off the world, if she is lucky 
enough to have that opportunity. 

Yes, Mrs. Wills, IF does teach and 
does make some people think. Thank 
heavens for the authors who do 
make us think, like Messrs. Zelazny, 
Pohl, Saberhagen, Anderson, Niven, 
Clark, Blish, Van Vogt, Vance, etc., 
etc., etc., etc. — (Mrs.) Dana Mor- 
ris, Apt. 6-F, 511 Chesterfield,

Dear Editor: 

As you may have gathered from 
the copies of Stroon I have sent 
you — I am somewhat of a Cord- 
wainer Smith enthusiast. I am cur- 
rently preparing a concordance/ 
exegesis and a chronology of the In- 
strumentality stories for future 
issues of Stroon. I was wondering 
if you either have . or know the 
whereabouts of any of the original 
manuscripts as it is possible that 
they might contain passages and in- 
formation deleted from the printed 
version which would be useful in 
the ordering of these stories. I am 
certainly willing to buy any of the 
manuscripts or pay for the cost of 
Xeroxing (TM) them. I have a 
similar interest in collecting the il- 
lustrations which accompanied the 
stories. I have about half the b&w 
for The Game of Rat and Dragon 



159 




and the full-sized cover painting for 
Space Lords as well as a few re- 
jected cover sketches for The Un- 
dermen (which I believe Pyramid is 
bringing out in early 1968). I fear 
that the interior illos have been 
scattered at conventions throughout 
the country but I have no idea what 
has happened to the magazine cover 
paintings. 

I bought International SF and 
found it interesting; a few com- 
ments are in order. I would prefer 
to see some longer stories, perhaps 
even a serial. It takes a much better 
writer to tell a short story well than 
a novelette; you should take advan- 
age of this in International by cut- 
ting down on the shorts. Please don't 
let the mag lapse into a reprint of 
British writers only (or even a large 
portion). They can submit their 
work directly to the U.S. magazines 
or try to get a British science fic- 
tion magazine started. Pm afraid 
I don't think too much of New 
Worlds in its new avatar and I don't 
think it provides a market for hard 
core sf of the Clement/Asimov/ 
Niven school. 

In If, Saberhagen's Brother Ber- 
serker was excellent — he has im- 
proved greatly since his first ap- 
pearance. * Some readers may rail 
against the mysticism but I feel 
that religion, metaphysics, etc. are 
perfectly legitimate fields for sci- 
ence-fiction (as well as science) to 
explore. The time may be propitious 
for a novel length Berserker story. 
By the by, the Star Trek episode, 
The Doomsday Machine by Norman 
Spinrad, seemed to . ah . draw 
inspiration from Saberhagen's con- 
ception of the Berserker machines. 

Keep the Larry Niven stories 
coming; he is one of the best new 
writers you have brought to us. I 
am curious about the ‘‘outsiders" he 



has mentioned in his stories and per- 
haps you could prevail upon him to 
feature them more centrally in a 
future story. 

I greatly approve of the new SF 
Calendar which you are starting in 
If. The surprising thing is that no 
magazine did it earlier — all the 
other professional fields have such 
listings. The regional cons have 
proliferated but then so have the 
number of fans. This listing should 
help increase attendance at Bos- 
kone V (23-4 March 1968). You are 
to be thanked for your thoughtful- 
ness and consideration as regards 
fannish activities. — Anthony 
Lewis, 124 Longwood Avenue, 
Brookline, Massachusetts 02146. 

• Matter of fact, it looks as though 
the calendar did just about double 
Boskone's attendance, with similar 
effects on the conferences in Balti- 
more, Columbus and elsewhere. For 
those of you who have never been 
to a science-fiction conference: the 
usual procedure is a program of 
talks by science-fiction writers, edi- 
tors, fans, artists and anyone else 
who may have something of interest 
to conununicate, plus a chance to 
meet and talk with other sf readers. 
If that sounds like the kind of thing 
you might enjoy, keep your eye on 
the SF Calendar in If. The way 
local conferences are proliferating, 
there'll be one in your own back yard 
before you know it! — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Since it will obviously take some 
time to put the Poster Plan 
brought up at the Phillycon into 
operation, may I offer a stop-gap 
measure, the Post Graffiti Plan. If 
even a third of the science fiction 
readers in this country would write 
“read science fiction" on the walls

IF 




of public rest rooms they visit the 
underground advertising would be 
immense. I am sure many want 
to be ahead of the game. So what 
if people laugh — they'll notice us. 
And maybe even read. — J.B. Post, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. 

• If the above reference to the “Pos- 
ter Plan'* confuses you, it was a 
notion suggested at last fall's Phila- 
delphia sf meeting to prepare 
and distribute posters advertising 
Galaxy^ If, etc. A fan suggested it 
from the audience. We said if 
enough people were willing to put 
them up, we'd have them made. 
Question is, how many readers 
would be willing to persuade their 
local dealers to put in the window a 
card saying something like “Read 
If — the Hugo Winning SF Maga- 
zine”. Would, for example, you? If 
enough readers indicate they'll try, 
anyway, we'll print the i>osters for 
you. — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I have some answers for and some 
comments on Mr. Kolodzeij's letter 
{Worlds of IF, Feb. '68). First, 
about the Doc Savage novels and 
Kenneth Robeson. Kenneth Robeson 
was the pen name for a number of 
different authors. As you probably 
know, the Doc Savage stories are 
reprints from the “pulp” magazines 
of the twenties, and the publishers 
were always fishing around for au- 
thors. About 170 different Doc Sav- 
age episodes were written, and the 
majority of them (about 90) were 
written by one person, whose name 
I forget. It seems that this man 
wanted his stories as true-to-life as 
they could be, because he always ex- 
plored the settings of his stories be- 
fore he wrote them. As a result of 
this, he had some quite hair-raising 



adventures. If anyone really wants 
more inf ormatioii, and has access to 
back issues of newspapers, there was 
an excellent article in The Nation-^ 
al Observer about six, or seven 
months ago on the topic of the re- 
vival of pulp literature. I cannot 
agree with Mr. Kolodzeij that the 
Jameson series is a must. It seems 
mediocre to me. 

A second book by John Norman is 
already out. It is named Outlaw of 
Gor and is about Tarl Cabot and his 
second trip to Counter-Earth. It is 
written in the same excellent style 
as Norman's first book.

Pohl, as Mowgli would say, “Good 
Hunting!” — Christopher Keith, 9

Dear Editor: 

In answer to R.W.C. Ettinger's 
article Interstellar Travel and Eter- 
nal Life, I can only say : “Who 
wants to remember everything?” 

I know I don't. There was a 
toothache I had a few years ago 
that I would rather forget, alto- 
gether. (Despite my liking for Hein- 
lein's “Stranger . .” pain is one 
thing I do not cherish!) 

Of course this would be taken 
care of by a selective memory, but 
— no matter how selective your 
memory is, you will, still, eventual- 
ly reach the saturation point, i.e., a 
time when you have done every- 
thing, twenty times each, and are 
1) bored, 2) jaded, 3) tired of this 
whole mess, and 4) ready to end it 
all. Which does not lead to immor- 
tality I 

There is one very important ad- 
vantage to forgetting, and this is
