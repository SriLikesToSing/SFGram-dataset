Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation. Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try it this way. Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets. Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Hum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting." 

"And you've been trying to discover why GALAXY is growing 
so popular? Every idea we've mentioned— and a lot more, be- 
sides— is treated dramatically and vividly in GALAXY! You really 
live them!" 

"Umm. How do I subscribe? After all, one shouldn't resist a 
trend, should one? Heh, heh!" 

"Just fill out the coupon— or make out your own order and 
send it in. The coupon's for your convenience, not ours. And now 
you'll be one of us!"

WORLDS TO EAT 



TIT - HEN Mary Margaret Mc- 
” Bride assembled her Harvest 
of American Cooking, she couldn’t 
have expected it to be the subject 
of a science fiction editorial. But 
there’s extrapolative meat and 
drink in this big book, published 
by Putnam at a hefty $7.50 that’s 
outweighed by its 1000 recipes 
and even more so by the superla- 
tive 220 pages of regional food 
history. 

This New World settlers came to 
must have been much like the 
planets we will yet subdue — or 
be subdued by. From the glaring 
southlands to the bitter north, 
there is a temperature range of 
nearly 200 degrees; air that varies 
from sinus-clogging soup to nose- 
bleed thinness; land from rich 
black to glacial strewings to de- 
hydrated sand; wood and plain 
aleap and awave with life, desert 
and mountain furtive with it; a 
garishly lavish living to be made 
— when men learned how to make 
it. 

For in region after region, 
MMM tells of Indians thriving 
and whites starving, the one 
through know-how, the other be- 
cause of its lack and fear of out- 



landish foods: The potato and 
tomato, among many examples, 
were considered poisonous, took 
two centuries to be accepted; when 
potatoes finally were, “they were 
often served with a sugar frosting, 
or cooked with dates, lemons, mace, 
cinnamon, sugar, nutmeg and 
grape juice!” 

If they encounter intelligent life- 
forms on other planets, colonists 
would be wise to respect the native 
botanists. For all our spectacularly 
advanced farm sciences, MMM 
soberingly quotes the U.S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture thus: “The 
white man has not reduced to cul- 
tivation a single important staple 
during the four hundred years he 
has dominated the New World.” 

Actually, we’ve lost many in- 
stead. Against our choice of fruits 
and vegetables, the Indians “ate 
the berries and fruits of nearly 300 
different plants. They fried the 
delicate redbud and boiled the 
buds of at least 15 other flowers, 
including marigold, clover and 
pokeweed. They made jams and 
relishes from a dozen plants, ate at 
least 59 varieties of greens.” The 
awesome total is over 1000 kinds

of edibles from bushes, trees, 
plants, ivies, ferns, grasses, mosses 
and seaweeds. 

Some of these are not losses at 
all: “Gone from the menu, and 
not deplored by anyone, is the 
bear-meat bacon of frontier days, 
as well as the ash cakes made of 
acorns, the substitute coffee made 
from seeds of wild rice and barley, 
and the bitter drink brewed from 
dried dandelion roots, said to be 
‘of a soporific nature’.” 

Ironically, Indian and pioneer 
emergency rations sell at luxury 
prices as, of all things, party treats! 

MMM gives a vivid description 
of uprooting that must be much 
like leaving the comforts and con- 
veniences of even an overcrowded 
Earth of the future for some wild, 
lonely planet: “Most of the women 
didn’t dream what it would be like 
in that vast land . They packed 
old silver and sprigged china . 
They took onion sets and packets 
of seeds.” In their heads they car- 
ried secret recipes and tricks with 
foods, and, arriving, shivered at 
tales like that of Bill Jones “about 
living on grasshoppers for six weeks 
in the 1870’s. They were pretty 
good, he said, but added that he 
wouldn’t want to stay alive long 
enough to eat them three times a 
day again.” 

That was Oklahoma, rebellious 
at first but swiftly wooed to aban- 
doned giving — and a savage

vengeance which should warn our 
colonists that land must get in re- 
turn or become a wrathful dust 
bowl: “When the ‘Black Blizzard’ 
descended upon them, farmwomen 
fought stubbornly — put milk, but- 
ter, water and all other liquids in 
covered fruit jars, mixed bread and 
biscuit dough in partly closed 
bureau drawers, with holes cut in 
cloth coverings for their hands to 
do the kneading. A cake made with 
sour cream and pecans evolved 
during the horror of dust and 
drought, to be known as Black 
Blizzard Cake.” 

If that lesson sticks, outworld- 
ers can eat without halt, perhaps 
besting Grand Duke Alexis of Rus- 
sia, who came in 1872 to hunt 
buffalo, was served 107 dishes, 
“including sage hen, black bear, 
curlew, roast opossum with per- 
simmon jelly, coon chops, roast 
fawn, plover” and numerous odd 
desserts. 

Mary Margaret is sure Mrs. 
McBride would have taken to 
deep-freeze, blenders, roto-broilers, 
mixes and instants. I wonder — 
it’s a hard transition. But I don’t 
doubt the colonist women will 
learn to cook magnificently in 
clumsy pots over unearthly fires. 

Gov. Alfalfa Bill Murray said: 
“Cooks could write as good a his- 
tory any day as the sociologists 
and the militarists.” True. And food 
for science fiction.

MARS BY MOONLIGHT 

By PAUL FLEHR 




I 

H ARDEE parked his jeep 
across the street from the 
Administration Building, 
opened the hatch and got out, 
gasping. 

It was cold midnight, better than 



che heat of the day, but his breath 
made a white mist in the thin air. 
He shivered. 

Mars — curse the place! Too 
hot by day, too cold by night, the 
air too thin all the time. 

He looked up. The stars were 
densely drifted in the sky over-

Certainly they were criminals — they were in 
a Martian penal colony. But what were their 
crimes — and how much time would they serve?

head. Both moons were out of 
sight; the stars made a white light, 
not bright enough to be obtrusive 
but enough, after he had turned 
out the lights of the jeep, to pick 
out details of the street, the curbs, 
the sidewalks, the low buildings. 
The little town did not possess 



street lights and, on nights like this, 
few persons bothered to turn on 
the outer lights of their homes; it 
wasn’t necessary. 

Around the corner there was a 
glow of red. Hardee took his sack 
out of the back of the jeep, grunted 
as he threw it over his shoulder 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT

and headed for the welcome glow. 

It came from a sign that read: 

BUNNIE’S PLACE 

Liveliest Night Spot on Mars 

IN the doorway, Hardee stood 
blinking. 

It was only a matter of fifty 
yards or so from the jeep, but he 
was sweating like a hog because of 
the weight of the sack. There was 
no dampness from the sweat — 
sweat was sucked greedily away 
into the thin dry aid as soon as it 
was formed. But it was wearing on 
the muscles and the skin; it was 
like pounding a treadmill. He was 
panting, and noise and light beat 
out at him. 

“Hardee!” yelled somebody. He 
nodded and waved, not troubling 
to identify whoever it was. Squint- 
ing, he moved inside and found a 
table. 

Bunnie’s Place. The Liveliest 
Night Spot on Mars. That was a 
flat lie — probably. There might 
be other places, but no one in Bun- 
nie’s Place had ever seen them; 
and if there were, they were bound 
to be livelier. What Bunnie’s Place 
had to offer was: 

A piano, dried from the desert 
air and in sad disrepair; on which, 
at the present moment, someone 
was trying to play a medley of 
familiar tunes, handicapped by the 
fact that all the B-flat keys in the 
middle octaves were broken. 

8 



A bar, stocked with ceaselessly 
replenished cases of blended whis- 
key, gin and brandy, but with 
very little else. 

A dozen tables, surrounding a 
cleared space suitable for dancing, 
now in use. 

A record player with several 
hundred LP records, mostly rock- 
and-roll, all well worn. 

Two pool tables, the felts of 
which were held together with 
sticking plaster. 

Two ping-pong tables. 

A “library.” It contained twen- 
ty-six books, all novels, dating from 
the years 1950-1955. 

Nearly one hundred persons, 
about a dozen of them women, the 
youngest of them thirty years old. 

That was Bunnie’s Place. As a 
night club, it was a failure. As the 
recreation room for a penal colony, 
however, it was not so bad; and 
that was what it was. 

Old Man Tavares came over to 
take Hardee’s order. 

“You’re late,” he wheezed. He 
claimed to have had lung trouble 
once, back on Earth, in that former 
life that each of them talked of 
endlessly. “The Probation Offi- 
cer was looking for you.” 

“I’ll see him later,” said Hardee. 
“Get me a highball first.” 

Tavares nodded and limped 
heavily away. The room was 
crowded. It was the dark of the 
moon, or nearly — moonrise would 
precede the morning sun by only 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an hour or so — so that practically 
all the trappers, like Hardee, tried 
to concentrate their monthly pro- 
bation reports into this short period 
of three or four days. 

If a trapper made his report on 
a full-moon night, it meant losing 
a night’s report. A trapper couldn’t 
afford that. He was on his own, 
despite being a prisoner. He 
needed every skitterbug he could 
catch, to pay his bills and provide 
his stake for the next month. 

HPHE alternative was to make 
-*• your report during daylight 
hours. But that was bad, if you 
had more than ten or fifteen miles 
to travel — Hardee had fifty — 
because at this time of year the 
desert by day was just plain too 
hot. Besides, the Probation Offi- 
cer didn’t like having his day’s 
sleep interrupted. And he was a 
prissy, querulous old man who had 
little real power — he was as much 
a felon as any of his charges; there 
was no one in the whole colony 
who hadn’t been sentenced there 
— and so he threw his weight 
around. 

“Hello, Hardee.” 

Hardee looked up, and for the 
first time smiled. 

“Hello, Joan.” 

Joan Bunnell, the “Bunnie” of 
Bunnie’s Place, was short, warm- 
faced, honey-haired. Hardee was 
fond of her; they had slept to- 
gether several times; they had even 



talked of getting married. But this 
was not a place for getting mar- 
ried. There was no rule against it 
—there were very few rules, every- 
thing considered, only the Big 
Rule against traveling more than a 
hundred miles from the little 
town, and a few lesser ones. But 
how could they talk seriously of 
getting married when either or 
both of them might still be mar- 
ried to someone back on Earth? 

She had two drinks on a tray, 
his and one for herself. She sat 
down, fanning herself. It wasn’t 
very hot — not compared to day- 
light outside. But it gave the im- 
pression, with the room’s bright 
colors and loud voices and the 
jukebox crashing against the sound 
of the battered piano, of being a 
cauldron. 

“Drink up,” said Joan Bunnell, 
toasting him. “You’ve got to keep 
your liquids up.” 

“You gotta keep something up,” 
bawled an ape’s voice from be- 
hind Hardee. It laughed raucously. 

Hardee turned, frowning. He 
recognized the voice. The man’s 
name was Wakulla. 

There, thought Hardee irritably, 
was the kind of man this place 
was made for. You knew just by 
looking at him that this was no 
bank embezzler or forger; this was 
knock-them-dead and loot-their- 
pockets. There was no finesse or 
cunning to those sloping shoulders 
and the curled black body hair 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT

that held his thin shirt cushioned 
an inch from his chest. The man 
was an ape. 

He boomed with an ape’s bel- 
low: “Hardee, you dumb chump, 
how many skits did you bring in 
this time?” 

TTIS shout didn’t exactly silence 
the room, but it did create a 
small oasis of quiet — an area 
roughly equal to the reach of his 
enormous fists. He was not liked. 
But he was feared; in a little world 
without law, he was feared very 
much. 

Hardee said clearly: “A hundred 
and fourteen.” 

“In there?” Wakulla kicked the 
sack beside Hardee’s chair. 

“Only about a dozen. The rest 
are outside in the jeep.” 

Wakulla nodded, then grinned 
an ape’s grin. “Good for you, Har- 
dee! You won the pool this month. 
You know what you won?” 

Hardee waited. 

“You won the privilege of buy- 
ing drinks for the house!” Wakul- 
la yelled. “Come on, boys. Line 
up!” 

Hardee glanced at Joan Bun- 
nell and pressed his shoulders 
against the back of his chair. 

There was a chance, he thought 
judiciously, that he could take 
Wakulla. The ape was inches 
shorter than himself, and that 
might make a difference. Every- 
thing else was going for Wakulla 



— reach, weight and the indestruct- 
ible animal combat urge that made 
all other considerations unimpor- 
tant. Still, there was that chance. 

But it was better to avoid a 
fight. 

Hardee took a deep breath and 
managed a grin. “Fair enough,” 
he said. 

Wakulla scowled, waiting. 

“Why not?” said Hardee reason- 
ably. “But if I win that for bring- 
ing in a few lousy skitterbugs, 
what do I win for this?” 

He hefted the sack to the top 
of the table and opened the draw- 
strings. 

There were a couple of skit- 
terbugs on top. He pulled them 
out and laid them on the table, 
where their long jointed legs be- 
gan to twine feebly under the room 
lights. Then, beneath them, was 
what he was looking for. 

He took it out, stood up and 
shook it loose. 

It hung from his hand limply. 
It was a gray canvas coverall, 
filthy, sweat-stained, spotted with 
what looked like blood. 

Wakulla demanded: “What the 
hell is that? 

“What does it look like? It’s a 
coverall. I took it off a man I 
found out in the desert three days 
ago. On foot.” 

TT created a sensation. 

Old man Tavares limped up, 
pushing his way through the 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



men around Hardee’s table, and 
clutched the filthy garment “The 
man who was wearing it. He was 
dead?” 

“What do you think?” It went 
without saying. It was possible to 
walk around the desert for short 
distances, but not for anything like 
the distance from one prospec- 
tor’s prefab to another. For that 
you needed a jeep. “I buried him 
out in the desert He was a 
stranger.” 

“A stranger!” Tavares let go of 
the garment and stared at it. 

Hardee dropped the skitterbugs 
back into the sack and closed it; 
as the light was cut off, the stirring 
stopped. He downed his drink. 

“You know that old mine, Wa- 
kulla — out between your place 
and mine? I was out there at day- 
break and I found this fellow. He 
wasn’t dead then.” 

Wakulla growled: “But you just 
said — ” 

“He was close enough to it. He 
was face-down on the sand and not 
moving. I stopped and went over.” 

Nearly everybody in- the room 
was clustered around now, listen- 
ing. The penal colony had been in 
existence for five years now — 
Hardee himself had been there for 
nearly three — and this was the 
first time a stranger had ever ap- 
peared. It was an event of the 
first magnitude, almost as though 
someone had finally completed his 
term, or as though, somehow, radio 



contact had been established with 
Earth. 

Hardee’s hand closed over the 
girl’s. 

“I tried to lift him up,” he 
said. “He was still breathing, but 
not too well — you know, gasping. 
Panting. You know how it was 
when you first got here? Only it 
seemed even worse with him. He 
was on his way out. And then he 
opened his eyes and looked at 
me.” 

Hardee paused, remembering 
the dry, opaque eyes in the tor- 
tured face. 

“It wasn’t just thirst and ex- 
posure,” he said, “because the man 
was pretty well scarred up. One of 
his arms was broken. I think. And 
— well, look at the coverall. You 
can see the blood. That’s how he 
was. He raised his head and he 
said something. I could hardly un- 
derstand him. And then he sat 
up and began to choke. And he 
died. He was pretty far gone, as 
I say.” 

Joan Bunnell demanded: “Har- 
dee! What did he say?” 

Hardee put down his glass and 
touched the coverall thoughtfully. 

“He said: “Thank God. A 

man!’” 

II 

F OUR hours later, Hardee was 
driving up to the shelter of 
his own prefab. 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT 



1 



The moon was peeping over the 
eastern horizon in a wash of white 
light that picked out the moun- 
tains around them. Hardee opened 
the door, looking up, gasping — 
that was the way it always was 
when you had been sitting for a 
while. In this thin air, when you 
began to lift yourself, the lungs 
strained for oxygen and found it 
only with difficulty. 

Let’s see, thought Hardee, star- 
ing at the broad white moon. That 
would be Deimos. Or Phobos. 
Some said the big one was Deimos, 
some the little. Nobody knew for 
sure, or nobody had yet convinced 
the rest of the colony. Old man 
Tavares was the only one who was 
really likely to know, and he only 
laughed when he was asked. 

Hardee thought the big one was 
Deimos. That was the one that was 
bright and useful, and for weeks 
on end you didn’t see it at all. 
The other one — what was the use 
of it? It was a rapid little comet, 
steel-blue and brighter than a star, 
yes, but not bright enough. It 
moved fast, fast; every night it 
soared across the sky two or three 
times. But it was no good for 
hunting. 

He got out of the jeep, wheez- 
ing. 

He left it with its motor going— 
he would be right back — and 
twisted the combination that un- 
locked the door of his home, his 
and the boy’s. 



Not everyone bothered locking 
the doors when they went out, but 
it was habit with Hardee. That 
was the way he was; and, besides, 
he had something more precious 
than most to protect 

Inside, he dumped his supplies 
on the floor and quickly looked 
into the boy’s room. That was all 
quiet. He closed the door gently 
and returned to the larger room, 
stowed the perishables in the freez- 
er, left everything else where it 
lay. He pulled out of his pocket 
the little sheaf of vouchers that 
represented the surplus skitterbugs 
— those whose profits had not been 
used up in paying for the supplies, 
for the installments on the jeep, 
the prefab itself and all of its 
furnishings. 

TTE locked the door behind him 
and rode out into the desert. 

There was still an hour of moon- 
light before the rising of the sun. 
It didn’t do to waste hours; there 
were just so many hours in the 
month when the skitterbugs could 
be caught. 

Old man Tavares said that the 
skitterbugs weren’t animals — they 
were machines. 

Tavares might know. He had 
been in the colony longer than 
most, and although his mind was 
wandering and he sometimes 
thought there was a war going on 
and all of them were in a con- 
centratiort camp, he had once been 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



an electronics engineer. Or so he 
claimed. 

Tavares rambled about mussels 
filtering iodine out of sea water 
and plants splitting oxygen out 
of C0 2 . Maybe it made sense and 
maybe not, but what he said was 
that the skitterbugs all came from 
one master skitterbug that had 
been made in a laboratory, back on 
old Earth. There was iron in the 
sand, said old Tavares, and other 
elements, and so somebody had 
invented a sort of basic reproduc- 
ible pattern of a machine, one 
which was simple and operated by 
sunlight, and could extract from 
sand and rock the ingredients 
necessary to produce other ma- 
chines just like itself. 

Maybe so. Maybe not. It was 
true that the skitterbugs looked 
like machines; they were metal. 
And yet they grew. Maybe so. The 
theory was simple. Even Hardee 
could see that, and he had been 
only a traffic policeman in the 
old days on Earth. Or thought he 
had. 

It didn’t matter much, one way 
or the other, to Hardee. What 
mattered to him was that during 
the hours of moonlight it was pos- 
sible to capture the skits; and that 
if you captured a hundred of them, 
you kept even with the necessary 
payments for supplies and install- 
ments to the Probation Officer; 
and if you captured more than 
that, you could even afford luxu- 



ries. And that mattered. Not so 
much for Hardee — he had too 
much self-punishment yet to in- 
flict on himself for that — but for 
the boy. 

The boy deserved a few luxu- 
ries. For he had nothing else. 

A MILE from the prefab, Har- 
dee switched on the RDF 

unit. 

The radio antenna that sprouted 
from the tail end of the jeep be- 
gan to circle slowly, feeling for 
broadcast radio energy. That was 
the important thing about moon- 
lit nights. 

The skitterbugs, whatever they 
were, operated on light energy. 
When light hit their domed ab- 
sorbent carapaces, the tiny cir- 
cuits inside them busily converted 
the light into heat and kinetic 
energy. But not quite all of it. 
There was a certain amount of 
waste in the form of free radio 
impulses. This the RDF scanner 
was designed to locate. 

Come to think of it, Hardee 
pondered, maybe that certain 
amount of waste was no waste at 
all. If it was true that the skit- 
terbugs were artificial, it might 
perfectly well be that the waste 
was designed into them, for exact- 
ly the purpose for which it was 
used — to locate and harvest them. 

But there had to be light to 
make them radiate and thus be 
found. 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT

By day, the blinding sunlight 
made them radiate like mad, of 
course, but that was no good. In 
daylight, the skitterbugs could out- 
run a man, even a jeep; they pro- 
duced strong signals, but what 
was the use of that when you 
couldn’t catch them? 

Starlight wasn’t very satisfac- 
tory either. On a particularly 
bright night, you might, if you 
were very, very lucky, pick up a 
few stray wisps of signal, but only 
provided you happened to blun- 
der within fifty yards or so of a 
skit. And then the impulses were 
too weak to be much help for di- 
rection finding. No, it had to be 
moonlight— the big moon— energy 
enough to make them radiate, not 
so much that they could get away. 

Hardee checked the little blips 
of light on his cathode screen and 
marked a concentration of a dozen 
or more. Undoubtedly half of them 
would be under the legal limit. 
Half a kilogram was the minimum; 
you could be fined the vouchers 
for a dozen full-sized skits for 
bringing in one under the limit. 
But with any luck at all, he should 
be able to bag one or two of the 
full-grown ones before the others 
succeeded in tunneling into the 
sand and out of sight. 

Hardee hunted until the broad 
red rising sun began to heat the 
desert, and then raced back toward 
the prefab, with four skitterbugs 
in the shielded locker. He circled 



the area where a long-abandoned 
shack marked the old mine, then 
took his foot off the gas, paused 
and looked back. 

Under the faded board sign that 
said almost illegibly “Joe’s Last 
Hope Shaft No. 1” was the shal- 
low grave Hardee had dug out for 
the stranger. There had been no 
name, no papers, nothing in the 
pockets that told him anything, 
and accordingly there was no in- 
scription on the little wooden head- 
board Hardee had hacked out in 
the growing heat of the morning 
sun. 

Hardee sat there for a moment, 
his mind vacant, vaguely wonder- 
ing about the man he had found. 
But it was growing hot. He put the 
jeep in gear and headed again for 
home. 

HTHE boy was awake and wait- 
ing for him at the door. 

“Daddy, Daddy!” he chanted, 
looking grave and sleepy. “Did you 
get it?” 

“Hi,” said Hardee inadequately. 
He bent over to pick the child up. 

Chuck was small for his age, a 
serious-faced, brown-eyed, dark- 
haired little five-year-old. He said 
immediately, throwing his arms 
around Hardee’s neck: “Daddy, 
did you get the tractor? I’ve been 
thinking about it! I woke up three 
times all night while you were 
gone.” 

“I’ll bet you did,” said Hardee. 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He tousled the boy’s hair, yearning. 
“Well, I got it. It’s in the sack.” 
“Oh, Daddy!” crowed the child. 
He wriggled frantically to be put 
down. 

As soon as he was on his feet, 
he raced into the house, through 
the little foyer where the foot- 
scrapers waited to get sand off the 
feet of visitors, and the hooks lined 
the wall for their clothes. He made 
a beeline for the pile of supplies. 
By the time Hardee had got rid 
of his sand boots and sweat- 
jacket, the boy was making a hor- 
rible scraping sound, tugging crates 
of canned goods out of his way; by 
the time Hardee reached the door 
of the room, Chuck had already 
opened the sack and was feeling 
inside. 

“Oh, Daddy!” he cried again, 
taking the tractor out. It was an 
exact model of a jeep with a bull- 
dozer blade mounted before it for 
sand moving, battery operated; it 
was controlled through a little 
hand-plate connected to the tractor 
with a long, thin wire. 

“I’ve only got one battery,” Har- 
dee warned. “Make it last. I don’t 
know when I can get another one.” 
“Oh, that’s all right, Daddy. I 
don’t mind that.” 

Experimentally, the boy turned 
on the power. The tractor lurched, 
whined, began pushing its blade 
across the linoleum floor. 

The boy chortled: “Wait till I 
get outside! I’ll stay near the house, 



Daddy, I promise. I’m going to 
make a fort and a castle! I’m go- 
ing to dig a long canal all the way 
from the house to the trash burner! 
I’m going to get the soldiers and 
my red truck and I’m going to 
make an Army camp that—” 

“Sure you are,” said Hardee, 
patting the boy on the head. “But 
first you’re going to have break- 
fast. Right?” 

TTARDEE managed to keep 
himself awake while the child 
and he had breakfast. He even 
managed to stay awake for nearly 
an hour afterward, but that was the 
limit. 

He stripped off his clothes, hung 
them neatly and fell into his bed. 
Outside, the boy was whooping 
at his new tractor. 

It wasn’t, Hardee admitted to 
himself, the best possible arrange- 
ment for him and the boy. But it 
was important that he be awake 
nights. And the boy was still too 
young to be trusted to roam around 
by himself while Hardee was out 
hunting. 

This way, they didn’t see as 
much of each other as Hardee 
would have liked — and, heaven 
knew, it was tough on Chuck to 
have to find his amusement for 
eight hours every day, to take his 
own meals at least twice a day, 
even to put himself in for a nap 
when the big hand and the little 
hand on the clock met at 12. Chil-

dren are most marvelously adapt- 
able organisms, and Chuck did all 
those things; but it was too bad, 
all the same. 

But what else was there to do? 

This way, the child was com- 
pletely alone only at night— when 
Hardee was out hunting, and 
Chuck himself was asleep. True, 
that wasn’t entirely safe. Some- 
thing could happen — a fire, a 
sudden sickness, even a fall out 
of bed. But it was better. And by 
day, when the child was up and 
about and thus more likely to run 
into trouble, at least Hardee was 
close at hand — even if asleep. 
Chuck could be trusted to wake 
him up. 

Hardee sighed and turned over. 
Overhead, he heard the engines 
of a transport plane, and, outside, 
excited shouts from Chuck. Har- 
dee could imagine him cavorting 
and waving at the plane. 

No, thought Hardee, covering 
himself lightly and closing his 
eyes, it wasn’t a perfect existence 
for either of them; but what else 
could you expect in a penal 
colony? 

Ill 

T N the light of the morning, Joan 
Bunnell closed the door of her 
room and began to take off her 
clothes. 

She put on light sleeping shorts 
and a short-sleeved top, patched 



and faded but the best she had 
been able to buy, and stood at the 
window, looking out on the desert 
She was facing west, away from 
the sunrise. She could see the 
black shadows streaming away 
from the sun-touched tops of the 
buttes and dunes. It was going to 
be a hot day. 

This time of year, you could 
say that it was going to be a hot 
day every morning and never be 
wrong. Funny, she thought, she’d 
never had any idea that Mars was 
as hot as this. Back in the old 
days. Before. She hadn’t, in fact, 
thought about Mars much at all. 

There was a lot of talk, she re- 
membered cloudily, about rockets 
and satellites, and even some 
dreamers who ventured the hope 
that men would someday touch 
the surface of the Moon. But 
Mars? That was for the Sunday 
comics. She’d paid no attention to 
that sort of nonsense. She most 
especially never had dreamed that 
someday she herself would be a 
prisoner on Mars, stripped of her 
freedom and her memories. 

Neither had any of the others— 
no freedom, no memories. 

She cranked down the filter 
panels that would keep out nearly 
all of the heat, and went over to 
her little dressing table to com- 
plete her going-to-bed ritual. 
Cleansing cream. Skin cream. Fif- 
ty strokes of the brush on each 
side of her scalp. Carefully rub- 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bing in the cream below the eyes, 
behind the jaws, along the line of 
the throat — the places where 
wrinkles and sagging would start 
first 

No, she told herself brutally, 
had started. This hot, dry air was 
devastating on a girl’s skin and 
hair; it was impossible to let things 
go for a single day. 

• She was sleepy, but she sat on 
the edge of the bed before lying 
down. 

It was impossible for her to go 
to bed without performing, once 
again, another and different sort 
of daily ritual. 

She looked across the room at 
her reflection in the mirror, won- 
dering. Then, hopelessly, auto- 
matically, she pushed back the 
short sleeves of her jacket and 
examined the skin of her inner 
arm, pulled back the hem of her 
shorts and examined the flesh of 
the thigh. 

There were no needle marks. 

“Dear God,” whispered Joan 
wretchedly. She had looked a 
thousand times before and there 
had been none. Well, maybe she 
ought to accept the evidence of 
her eyes as definite; whatever it 
was that she had been sentenced 
to this place for, narcotics addic- 
tion was not the answer. 

It was the most severe portion 
of the punishment, that not one of 
the prisoners knew what they were 
being punished for. 



F RAMED on the wall, over the 
head of her brass bedstead, 
was an excerpt from Martian Penal 
Colony Rules and General Infor- 
mation. She had never seen the 
manual itself, though it was gen- 
erally understood that the Proba- 
tion Officer had a copy. But the 
excerpt she knew by heart Every- 
one did. Nearly every room in the 
colony had it framed and hung: 

You are here because you have 
been tried, convicted and sen- 
tenced for a felony. 

In former times, felonies were 
punished by prison sentences. 
This ordinarily failed of its pur- 
pose, in that it did not act as a 
deterrent to repetitions of the 
same offense. 

In recent years, a technique 
has been developed of erasing 
memories after a certain date — 
usually, for technical reasons, 16 
October 1959. By virtue of the 
XXVth Amendment, provision for 
the use of this technique has been 
incorporated in the Uniform Pe- 
nal Code of the United States, 
and under it you have been sen- 
tenced to rehabilitation and to 
transportation to the Martian Pe- 
nal Colony for an indefinite 
period. 

You will be observed from 
time to time, and the degree of 
your rehabilitation evaluated. 
When you are ready to return to 
normal life, you will be paroled. 

It is not in the interests of 
your best efforts toward rehabili- 
tation that you be advised of the 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT 17 



crime of which you were con- 
victed. However, the categories 
covered by the Uniform Penal 
Code include: 

Murder, first degree. 

Murder, second degree. 

Manslaughter, in connection 
with a felony. 

Grand larceny, grand fraud and 
embezzlement — but only 
after the third offense in 
each case. 

Habitual use of drugs, without 
voluntary rehabilitation. 

Habitual prostitution. 

That was the list. Joan knew it 
well. 

It was a choice selection, and 
it had to be one of them that 
she was guilty of. But which one? 

Joan Bunnell stared long at 
her own face, wondering if those 
eyes were the eyes of a murderess. 
Had she killed a husband, a lover? 
Perhaps a parent, seeking to in- 
herit their wealth? Perhaps even 
a child — had she had a child? 
Could she have given birth to a 
baby, perhaps a boy small and 
grave-faced like Hardee’s young- 
ster — and could she, in madness 
or in hate, have killed the child? 

It was not fair to carve out a 
piece of her mind and cast it away. 

J OAN lay back on the pillow, 
her closed eyes cushioned 
against her forearm by her own 
long hair. It was the cruelest of 
all punishments, this mind-wash- 



ing they called rehabilitation. 

The Arabs chopped off a hand, 
the old English lopped off a fin- 
ger or an ear, the Indians gouged 
out an eye . and those were 
kinder things, much kinder; for at 
least the victim knew exactly what 
he had lost. 

But here was Joan Bunnell, thir- 
ty-one years old, according to the 
records in the Probation Office. 
She remembered her childhood 
very well, in a monotonous brown- 
stone two-family house on a 
monotonously uniform block in 
Philadelphia. She remembered go- 
ing to school and she remembered 
her first job; she remembered a 
birthday party, and, closing her 
eyes, was able to count the candles 
and so know that she had turned 
twenty-one. 

She remembered years after 
that, loves and partings. She re- 
membered yearning after the man 
she worked for, and that he mar- 
ried someone else. (Had she killed 
him?) She remembered that life 
had coursed, full and complete, 
with days compact with trivia and 
detail, for all the days of her life, 
up until a certain day— yes, the 
sixteenth day of October, in that 
year of 1959 — when she had got 
up in the morning, dressed her- 
self, eaten breakfast at a corner 
drugstore, got into a subway train 
to go to work— 

And woke up in a place where 
she had never been. 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



What had happened? 

There was no clue, except the 
framed excerpt over her bed, and 
the gossip of the other prisoners. 

Like her, they had awakened; 
like her, they had been questioned 
endlessly; like her, they had been 
confined. And, like her, they had 
been put, blindfold, into an air- 
plane, flown for some hours— and 
released here. 

They knew that they had com- 
mitted a crime. Of course. That 
was why they were here. 

But what crime? 

How many years had been 
lopped off their minds? 

Joan lay against the pillow, too 
tired to weep, wept out. 

After a while, and just as she 
might have slept, she heard a 
distant roar of engines growing 
closer. 

She got up and looked out the 
window, pulling back the screens 
that cut down the light and heat. 

A silvery plane was limping in 
low over the sand hills, from the 
west. It didn’t circle or seek a 
traffic pattern; it came in and 
down, dumped its landing flaps, 
along the level sand that was kept 
bulldozed flat for it. 

Joan, no longer sleepy, got up 
and began getting dressed again. 
The plane meant supplies — per- 
haps new clothes, and she could 
use them; perhaps some toys that 
she might be able to get for Har- 
dee’s son. Most of all, the plane 



might mean a few new inmates for 
the colony. 

In slacks, blouse and a broad- 
brimmed sun hat, she hurried out 
after the growing crowd around 
the rickety old plane. 

W AKULLA had stayed over— 
not even the son of Polish 
miners wakes up and crosses the 
desert after drinking a bottle and 
a half of rye. 

“I got to see these guys,” he 
said thickly, grinning painfully. “I 
got to see what a free man looks 
like, in case they ever let me out 
of here.” 

“They never will,” muttered 
someone, and Joan edged away as 
Wakulla lifted his squat head and 
looked around to see who it was. 
She wasn’t looking for trouble. 

The Probation Officer came 
hastily up, panting eagerly for the 
big moment of his being. 

“Out of the way!” he quavered. 
“Here there, please! Out of the 
way, Saunders! Here, let me 
through, Tavares! Come on. 
Please!” 

“Let the keeper through!” 
bawled Wakulla, forgetting about 
the man who had muttered. “Hur- 
ry up, Tavares, you old bag of 
bones!” 

The three sputtering propellers 
of the aircraft coughed and choked, 
and then stopped. Tavares and two 
other men hurried to push a metal 
ladder on wheels— with great dif-

ficulty — through the clinging sand 
up to the side of the plane, as the 
door jerked and then flew open. 

Even Joan Bunnell, who was far 
from a mechanic, had not grown 
accustomed to the sight of a Ford 
tri-motor lumbering around in the 
thin air of Mars. That washboard 
fuselage, those ancient wood- 
bladed props, they were period ac- 
cessories from an old movie, not 
anything you ever expected to see 
in the air —anywhere. True, some 
of the men talked wisely about how 
the old Ford was a great plane for 
its time and a record-breaker; 
and they maintained that in all 
sorts of out-of-the-way places little 
out-of-the-way airlines had for 
decades kept up a sort of service 
using the Fords . but on Mars? 

But there it was, as it had al- 
ways been for all of them — it 
was the ship each of them had 
arrived in. And by and by the 
wonder had grown duller, sub- 
merged in the greater, special won- 
derment that each of them had, 
that went incessantly: What was 
it that I did that got me sent here? 

r l 1 HE door of the plane swung 
rasping on its hinges, catch- 
ing the bright hour-high sun and 
sending blinding rays into the faces 
of the colonists. Behind the glare, 
a man poked his head out— an old, 
haggard head. 

“Hello, Mr. Griswold!” cried the 
Probation Officer in a thin high 



voice, greeting him. He waved 
violently. “Here I am, Mr. Gris- 
wold!” 

This was the Probation Officer’s 
time. Barring this time, he was no- 
body — not even in the penal 
colony of brain-blotted felons, not 
anywhere. All his days and nights 
at the penal colony were alike; 
they were partly bookkeeper’s 
routine and partly file-clerk’s 
duties, and partly they were with- 
out any shape at all. They de- 
served little respect from anyone 
and they got none — all those 
days. But on the few, the very 
occasional, days when the Ford 
transport waddled in — then he, 
the Probation Officer, he was the 
one that Mr. Griswold spoke to. 

Mr. Griswold came with the 
plane, always. Mr. Griswold was 
the only man they ever saw who 
went back to freedom. And the 
Probation Officer was the link 
between the colony and Mr. Gris- 
wold — and, through him, the rest 
of Mars, and more remotely, that 
unimaginably most distant of 
dreams, Earth and home. 

“Hello,” murmured Griswold in 
a faded, wispy sort of voice. He 
stood there, haggard and blinking 
in the sunlight, nodding to the Pro- 
bation Officer. “I’ve got some new 
mouths to feed,” said Griswold, 
and grinned a ruin of a grin, as 
though he had meant it for a joke 
but could never laugh again. 

Joan Bunnell pressed closer, 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



though she disliked Griswold and 
usually, instinctively, stayed well 
clear of him. Each time Joan saw 
him, he appeared decades older, 
degrees more demon-haunted than 
the time before. She knew his age 
well enough, because she remem- 
bered him from her own trip to 
the colony, three years before. He 
had been about fifty then, could 
be hardly fifty-five now. 

But he looked seventy at the 
least, perhaps some remote and 
meaningless age past a hundred. 
His hands shook, his voice shook, 
his face was a working collision of 
jumpy muscles and fast-blinking 
eyes. Drugs? Drink? A terminal 
disease? It could hardly be any 
of those things, Joan thought; but 
if it was his job that made him 
so decrepit and so weak, then 
working conditions on the outside 
of the penal colony must be even 
worse than within it 

And there was one other thing 
about Mr. Griswold. He never left 
the old plane. 

In the three years of Joan’s ex- 
perience, he had yet to climb down 
that metal ladder to stand on the 
ground. 

CINCE Griswold would not 
^ come down the ladder, the 
Probation Officer eagerly and im- 
portantly puffed up it. 

There was a moment while he 
and Griswold talked to each other, 
low-voiced, at the door to the 



cabin of the old tri-motor plane. 

Then the Probation Officer 
stepped aside. “Let ’em out, please,” 
he ordered. “Let the new fish come 
down the ladder!” 

Five men and women began 
to file out of the plane, squinting 
in dazed unbelief at the sunwashed 
scene around them. 

Wakulla caught sight of one of 
the women and yelled an animal’s 
cry of glee. “That’s for me!” He 
meant it for a playful aside, but 
that voice was not meant for stage 
whispers. He grinned at the wom- 
an; then his expression changed to 
astonishment. 

He wasn’t alone. There was a 
gasp. “She’s got a kid with her!” 
cried one of the women beside 
Joan Bunnell. Joan caught her 
breath. That was very odd — and 
very rare, and very precious. There 
were four babies in the colony, 
born there, three of them in wed- 
lock and one in doubt. But this 
was a girl of five or six, not a new- 
born. That was almost without 
precedent — the only other child 
who had been brought to the colo- 
ny was Hardee’s boy. 

A dozen hands helped the wom- 
an with the child down the lad- 
der. They led her, with the others, 
across the hot sands toward the 
shelter. 

Joan cast one glance at the 
plane. Already Tavares’s crew was 
beginning to unload crates of sup- 
plies. Already the tied sacks of 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT 



21 



skitterbugs, feebly stirring in the 
light that filtered through the bur- 
lap, were being trundled out on 
wheelbarrows to be loaded into the 
plane for return to — where? No 
one had ever said. Back to Earth, 
perhaps. Perhaps not. 

The glass windscreens of the 
tri-motor’s battered old nose glit- 
tered opaquely. 

Joan glanced at them and then 
away — there was nothing there; 
she never could see inside the cock- 
pit; no one ever had. Behind those 
glittering windshields were, un- 
doubtedly, the pilot and co-pilot— 
for surely Griswold was no aviator, 
not with that tic and those eyes. 
But she had never seen the pilots, 
not even when she herself was 
part of the plane’s cargo, coming 
here. And she didn’t expect to 
see them now. 

But something was nagging at 
her. 

She looked again, and her eye 
was caught by old Dom Tavares, 
who should have been helping to 
load the plane, and who instead 
was standing in a queerly tense 
attitude, staring at the open door. 

Joan tried to peer past the door, 
but it was hard to see from the 
bright sun outside into the black 
shadows within. There was Gris- 
wold, and there was the Probation 
Officer, surely— at least there were 
two shadows. And the taller, fat- 
ter shadow was handing something 
to the lean, bent one — something 



that looked like a rag, or an old 
garment; they were talking about 
it 

Joan hesitated, wondered if it 
was worth thinking about 

But there were the newcomers 
—new faces, when all the old faces 
were worn so familiar. 

And Tavares was, it was perfect- 
ly true, getting a little odd in his 
ways anyhow. Everyone knew that 

She turned, dismissing whatever 
it was that disturbed Tavares, and 
hurried after the newcomers as 
they were shepherded into the 
recreation room. 

¥>Y day, the “Liveliest Night 
Spot on Mars” was even less 
attractive than by night 

The night before had been a 
big one; the signs of it were all 
over the room, overturned chairs, 
spilled drinks, the grime of a 
couple of dozen men in town. No 
one had taken the time to tidy 
up — that was done later, usually 
in the waning heat of the after- 
noon — and the new arrivals stared 
around them with revulsion in their 
eyes. 

“They’re very young,” someone 
whispered to Joan. She nodded. 
One of the women was middle- 
aged, but the one with the child 
was just into her twenties. And 
of the men, one was little more 
than a boy. 

He was a blond-haired young- 
ster, his eyes violet and innocent, 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



his face far from the time of shav- 
ing. What, Joan wondered, had 
brought him here? For that matter, 
what was the crime of the dowdy- 
looking, plump little woman who 
was staring around in such panic? 

The colonists were all over the 
new women — particularly Wakul- 
la, gallant with an ape’s clumsy 
politeness. “A chair!” he bawled. 
“A chair for the lady!” And he 
wrenched one from Joan’s hand. 
“I’ll take the calf to get the heifer,” 
he whispered hoarsely, with an 
exaggerated wink, and slid the 
chair clattering to the girl with the 
child. The girl only stared at him 
fearfully. 

Joan tried to stay back and give 
the newcomers room. 

She had a vivid sense of what 
they must be feeling; she remem- 
bered; she could read the writing 
in their eyes, and know what they 
must be thinking: 

The strangeness of their sur- 
roundings. 

The sudden shock. (For it was 
always a shock, everyone agreed 
on it; one minute you were going 
about your business, a minute later 
you woke up somewhere else. A 
strange somewhere, and removed 
in time — in a white-walled room, 
with a couple of tense and wor- 
ried-looking doctors and nurses 
around you, with television scanner 
lenses in the walls . and, very 
quickly, a tense and worried-look- 
ing man in uniform coming in to 



talk to you, to tell you that you 
had become a criminal, in a life 
that was now wiped out of your 
mind, and that you were on Mars, 
headed for a penal colony. Shock? 
It was a wonder that it didn’t 
prove fatal. And perhaps for some 
it had; they had no way of know- 
ing.) 

But more than these things — 
after that first shock wore off and 
you had become reconciled to the 
fact that your whole life had some- 
how been perverted into that of a 
criminal — after you had been bun- 
dled, blindfold, into that rattling 
old three-motored plane and flown 
for windowless hours across the 
unseen Martian deserts — then you 
arrived. 

And that was bad. 

For there was always the un- 
easy, shamefaced question in the 
crowd: Does this one know who 
I am? And that other one — why 
is he grinning like that? Does he 
know what I did? And what did 
he himself do, to be in this place? 

Nobody ever got over it 

But the early days were worst 
of all, before the pain became an 
accustomed one. 

HP HE heat was beating in on 
them. The woman with the 
child, half afraid, half contemp- 
tuous of Wakulla’s gallantry, leaned 
white-faced against the back of her 
chair, the little girl with a thumb 
in her mouth and the other hand

clutching her mother’s skirt be- 
side her, watching silently. 

The boy was talking — his name 
was Tommy and he had told them 
he was seventeen years old. “That’s 
what they tell me, he said, with a 
painful effort to be adult and sure 
of himself. His voice was a soft 
high mumble, hardly the voice 
even of a seventeen-year-old. “But 

— I don’t remember that. Really, 
I don’t. The last thing I remem- 
ber, I was twelve!” 

Twelve! Joan made a faint 
sound; almost she patted him on 
the head, though he was taller than 
she. Twelve! What sort of criminal 
could have hatched at twelve? 
Even at seventeen, the thing was 
ridiculous! But somewhere, this 
child had lost five years. 

She tried to explain it to him: 
“You must have done something, 
Tommy. Maybe you got involved 
with the wrong bunch at school — 
who knows? But somehow, you 
went wrong. That’s why they send 
people here, you know. It’s the 
new law. Instead of putting some- 
one in jail and keeping them there 

— that would be a waste, you see, 
and cruel — they wipe out the 
part of the minds that has the 
criminal pattern in it. They go 
back erasing memory, until they 
come to a part that is clean and 
unaffected, not only before the 
crime was committed but before, 
even, the first seed of the crime 
was planted. That’s why none of 



us know what it was we did. It’s 
been taken away from us. We’ve 
been given a second chance. We 
should be grateful.” 

But should they? It was the old 
question; she cast it off. 

“Then,” she said, “after they’ve 
cleaned out our memories and 
taken us back to the right path, 
they send us up here. To Mars. 
This is a colony where we can 
try to get reoriented and—” She 
hesitated. And what? “And go 
back to normal life,” she finished 
strongly, though there was still the 
relentless reminder of her memory 
that no one had ever gone back. 
“It isn’t so bad, Tommy,” she 
promised. 

He didn’t look convinced. 

S OMEONE was calling her 
name: “Joan! Joan, come 

here, please!” 

It was old man Tavares. He was 
standing in the door, his face 
blenched a muddy mottled color 
in spite of the dark the sun had 
given it. 

She turned and hurried to him. 
Heat-stroke, she thought at once. 
It was far from uncommon, es- 
pecially when a man as old as 
Tavares had to work in the blind- 
ing sun helping to lift boxes and 
bales. 

But he caught her feverishly by 
the hand and drew her outside into 
the sunwashed street. 

“Joan,” he whispered raggedly,

terror peeping out of his eyes. 
“Joan, can you borrow a jeep?” 
“Why— I suppose so. But—” 
“Take me to Hardee,” he 
begged. His lined old face was 
quivering with senile worry and 
fear; his dry, hot hand was crush- 
ing hers. “Quickly! It will take 
hours for us to drive there. And 
we may not have hours, because 
they can fly in the plane! Quickly, 
for his sake and your own!” 

Joan said reasonably: “Now 

hold on, Dom. You’re excited. Sit 
down for a minute.” She tried to 
lead him back into the recreation 
room. She’d seen the signs coming 
on, she reproached herself, when 
he behaved so queerly at the plane; 
she should have done something 
about it at the time. Poor old man! 
“Come on, Dom,” she coaxed. “I’ll 
get you a nice cool drink of water 
and—” 

“Quickly!” He planted his feet 
firmly, .surprisingly strong, and 
halted her. His eyes were terrified; 
they flicked past her, out toward 
the plane. “You don’t understand, 
Joan! The Probation Officer, he 
has told Griswold about the 
stranger Hardee found. It is a ter- 
rible thing, do you not realize?” 
“Stranger?” she repeated. 

“The dead man, Joan! I saw 
them with the coverall, and then 
I knew. So I came close and lis- 
tened and, yes, he was telling Gris- 
wold. And Griswold was frantic! 
Of course. Hurry, Joan!” 



Doubtfully, she said: “Well, let’s 
see. You want to go out to Har- 
dee’s place? Wakulla’s not far from 
there. I suppose I can persuade 
him to take us out, though he’s 
got that new woman on his mind. 
It’s a bad time of day, but—” 
“Hurry!” 

The panic in his voice finally 
reached her. All right, she thought, 
why not? She could handle Wakul- 
la — even in the face of the con- 
stant threat of a boiled-out motor 
and trouble, the natural risk you 
took in driving across the sand by 
summer daylight. But Tavares 
gave her no choice. 

Still she protested, half-resisting: 
“Can’t it wait until night, Dom? 
Surely it can’t be as serious as all 
that. After all, what’s so dangerous 
about a stranger? I suppose he’s 
merely a man who got lost in the 
desert — at most, perhaps he es- 
caped from another prison camp, 
somewhere else on Mars, but cer- 
tainly that doesn’t—” 

“Mars!” Tavares hissed in a ter- 
rible whisper. Convulsively he 
squeezed her arm. “Joan, do you 
not understand? All these years— 
and you still think that this is 
Mars?” 

IV 

TTARDEE woke groggily to the 
sound of the boy’s voice call- 
ing: “Daddy! Somebody’s com- 
ing!” 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT 



25 



It was only about noon. 

Hardee swung himself out of 
bed, half asleep, his eyes aching. 
He stumbled over to the window 
and pushed back the shutters. 

Fierce light beat in. He blinked, 
dazzled. The sun was directly 
overhead. The boy had been right; 
there was a jeep coming, still a 
long way off, but he could hear the 
faint whine and echo of its motor 
as the driver shifted gears, coaxing 
it around the worst of the bumps, 
trying to keep it from overheating. 
Someone driving at this time of 
day! 

It must be an urgent errand, he 
thought, and began to clamber 
into his clothes. He couldn’t make 
out who was in it, in the blinding 
light; but by the time he was into 
his shirt and pants and ready to 
come downstairs, he could hear 
voices. Tavares and Joan Bunnell 
— and his son, crying out to greet 
them. 

“Aunt Joan!” Chuck was bab- 
bling excitedly — it was a great 
day for him when there were visi- 
tors. “Look at what Daddy got me, 
Aunt Joan! A tractor. And see, I 
can make a farm with Alice and 
Alfie — see? This is my tractor, 
and Alice and Alfie are the cows!” 
Alice and Alfie were his pet skit- 
terbugs. Hardee had captured 
them with the regular bag; but 
they were undersized, not of legal 
limit to bring in, so he had given 
them to the boy to play with for 



lack of a kitten or a pup. 

Hardee nodded without speak- 
ing and started down the stairs. 
The child was pushing the quies- 
cent skitterbugs around on the floor 
with the tractor, whooping with 
joy. In the filtered, screened-down 
light that came inside the prefab, 
they had just enough energy to 
try to creep out of its way. 

Joan stared up at Hardee, began 
to speak, then caught herself. She 
took the boy’s arm lightly. 
“Chuck,” she said, “listen to me. 
We have to talk to your father. 
Go outside and play, please.” 

He stood up, his eyes wide and 
disturbed. “Oh, let me stay, Aunt 
Joan! My tractor’s—” 

“Please, Chuck.” 

He looked up at his father, hesi- 
tated, and started toward the door. 
Then he paused, looking at Wakul- 
la and Tavares; even in his child’s 
mind, he knew that it was not 
usual to see them there. 

With a child’s response, an in- 
cantation against evil, he sum- 
moned up politeness: “Hello, Mr. 
Tavares. Hello, Mr. Wakulla.” He 
hesitated, then remembered one 
more cantrip. “Don’t worry, Dad- 
dy,” he piped. “I’ll be carefully to 
stay in the shade.” 

J OAN Bunnell, torn, said: 
“There isn’t any shade. I tell 
you what.” She glanced at Wakul- 
la. “You’d better play in Mr. 
Wakulla’s jeep. Make believe

you’re driving it all by yourself.” 

“Wheel” The boy shouted glee- 
fully. He dropped tractor and 
skitterbugs, flung the door open 
and leaped out into the sand. 

Sunlight flared in. 

One of the bugs — it was im- 
possible to tell which; only the boy 
could tell them apart— lay square- 
ly in the path of the sun’s rays. 
There was a sudden crinkling 
snap of sparking energy as the 
light it fed on struck it; like a re- 
leased spring, the little spidery 
metal thing spun around, leaped 
out the door and was gone. 

It was like a meteorite flung 
up into space, so quick and glit- 
tering. 

Hardee closed the door behind 
it and turned to face the others. 
‘What’s the matter?” he de- 
manded. 

Old man Tavares sank into a 
chair. “That stranger,” he croaked. 
“The Probation Officer told Gris- 
wold about him, and now there 
will be trouble. For there is a lie 
here, Hardee. This is not the sort 
of place we are told it is. It is not 
on Mars; we are not criminals. 
And there must be a reason for 
this lie. What reason? I do not 
know, but whoever is telling the lie 
will protect it.” 

He leaned forward. “It may cost 
your life to protect it, Hardee! 
Others have died, and I think for 
the same reason — you are in dan- 
ger, and, with you, all of us be- 



cause of the fact that you told 
us!” 

Hardee shook his head. He was 
still more than half drowsy. The 
world had not yet come into focus; 
he was drugged from heat and 
sleep and none of this was making 
sense. 

He said thickly: “What the hell 
are you talking about, Tavares?” 

“I am talking about death!” said 
the old man. And then he stopped, 
and there was sudden fear on his 
face. “Listen!” 

Outside, a noise. An engine. No 
— more than one. 

“Someone coming?” guessed 
Hardee. “A jeep?” 

“It is death that is coming,” 
sobbed Tavares. “That’s no jeep, 
Hardee. It is the plane, coming for 
you!” 

nPHEY ran to the door and flung 
it open. 

It came from the east, like a 
faint angry snarl of bees, the 
sound of the Ford tri-motor’s three 
laboring engines. 

“There it is!” cried the girl. 
“Look, over the dunes!” 

Sunlight glinted off a wing. It 
was the plane, all right, hardly five 
hundred feet up. It was heading off 
to one side, more in the direction 
of Wakulla’s hut than Hardee’s; 
clearly, whoever was flying it was 
unfamiliar with the exact loca- 
tions of the prefabs. 

But clearly also, it would not 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT 



27 



take long to straighten them out 

“Come on!” said Hardee, and 
flung out the door. Whatever it 
was that Tavares was talking 
about, something of the old man’s 
panic and desperation had reached 
him. “We’ll have to hide! Wakul- 
la, you know the old mining shack? 
Let’s go!” 

Hardee caught his son up and 
raced for his own jeep, leaving the 
others to follow in Wakulla’s. 

The heat was murderous. Before 
they had gone a hundred yards, 
the radiator needle was climbing; 
in a hundred more, it was press- 
ing perilously against the back- 
stop. But Hardee couldn’t wait to 
baby the motor now, not when the 
plane had begun to wheel around 
toward them. Already it might be 
too late; it was quite possible that 
the plane had spotted them. But 
it was at least a chance that the 
plane had not. A desert drenched 
in a vertical sun is not easy to 
scan, and there was a lot of it. 

Next to him, on the seat, the 
little boy looked up wonderingly 
at his father, and was silent. 

“It’s all right, Chucky,” Hardee 
said, the automatic lie coming to 
his lips. It wasn’t all right. There 
was nothing all right about it. 

But it satisfied the boy. He 
squirmed around and knelt back- 
ward on the seat, peering out the 
rear mirror. “They’re catching up, 
Daddy!” he yelped cheerfully. 
“Step on it! We’ll beat them!” 



Even through heat and worry 
and overpowering weariness, Har- 
dee had enough left to feel fond- 
ness and pride for his child. 

At the abandoned old mine site, 
Hardee spun the jeep in toward 
the shed. He parked it under the 
overhang of the dangling board 
sign marked Joe’s Last Chance 
No. 1, crowding over as far as he 
could to make room for the other. 
In a moment, Wakulla drove up 
beside him and squeezed in. 

C LIMBING out, they stared at 
the hostile bright sky. “Stay 
under the shed!” Hardee said. “If 
they’ve seen us—” 

But apparently the plane had 
not. 

They could see it clearly, drop- 
ping down over the dunes. It 
picked out Hardee’s prefab, 
banked and swung around it twice; 
then leveled off, headed out across 
the desert, banked again, came in 
and landed bruisingly on the un- 
even sand. 

It was a rotten landing, but as 
good as could be expected for 
drifted sand. A tire might have 
blown or a wheel collapsed, but 
did not; the plane was lucky and 
the hidden fugitives were not; they 
would not be saved by a crash 
that would destroy their pursuers. 

The plane stopped, perhaps a 
quarter of a mile from the prefab 
but well out of their sight The 
motors died. 



28

They waited. 

“Now what?” demanded Wakul- 
la angrily. He had been dragged 
away from a woman, and made to 
drive bouncingly across the hot 
sand with a hangover, and there 
was talk he hardly understood of 
danger that was never quite clear, 
and he was irritable. 

Hardee climbed to the top of the 
old shed wordlessly. He stretched 
tall and peered toward his home. 

“Can’t see,” he called down to 
the others. “I can’t even see the 
house. I wonder what they’re 
doing.” 

“Come down,” said old man Ta- 
vares in a tired voice. 

He sat on the sand with his 
back against the weathered boards, 
his eyes half closing, but not with 
drowsiness. The heat was very 
great, especially for a man near 
seventy, and especially for a man 
who had lived with outrageous fear 
for four years and now found his 
fears exploding in his face. 

“Doing?” Tavares repeated 
wearily. “I shall tell you what they 
are doing.- They are searching.” 
His voice was hardly louder than 
a whisper, in the perfect quiet of 
the hot desert air. “They see that 
your jeep is not there, but they 
search your house. They observe 
that you are not in it. It takes 
very little time to do this; there 
is not much to search.” 

“Right,” said Hardee roughly, 
dropping to the sand beside him. 



“Then what will they do next?” 
Old man Tavares opened his 
eyes. He looked out across the 
sand. “Then I think they will take 
off again in the plane and look 
all through the desert for you. 
They will figure to find you easily 
from the air. But—” He paused, 
thinking. “Yes,” he said. “It is not 
a good plane for the purpose and 
in any case they will want more, 
for they do not wish to miss you. 
So more will be summoned.” 
“More planes?” repeated Joan. 
“I never saw any other planes.” 
“You will,” said Tavares sadly. 
“In an hour, perhaps, or two hours, 
there will be many planes flying 
overhead. But in much less time 
than that, this one that is by Har- 
dee’s home will search for us.” 

O UT behind the shed was the 
blank headboard and the 
shallow grave where Hardee had 
buried the stranger. Tavares 
looked at it longingly. 

“If he were alive,” he whis- 
pered, “then perhaps we could 
learn something.” 

“We could dig him up,” Wakul- 
la rumbled. 

The girl made a faint sound. 
“In this heat? After nearly a 
week?” 

Hardee shook his head. “No, we 
won’t dig him up. Not because of 
the heat— if s dry, Joan; he’ll be 
half a mummy by now. But I put 
him there and I know what I

buried. There’s nothing on him but 
ragged shorts and a pair of shoes. 
Nothing that would tell us any- 
thing.” He gestured back toward 
the ringing hills. “That’s where his 
trail came from. I didn’t follow 
it, and now the wind has wiped it 
out, but that’s where it was.” 

“No matter,” said Tavares with 
the calm of resignation. “It is too 
late for any of those things.” He 
nodded toward where the plane 
had landed. 

“You think they mean trouble?” 
Wakulla demanded. 

“Think?” Tavares glanced at 
him opaquely, then once again out 
across the hot, dry sand. “I do not 
think. I know. Look.” 

A flare of flame, almost invisible 
against the bright sky, fringed with 
bits of metal and sand and uniden- 
tifiable debris, leaped up over the 
dunes. Smoke followed. 

“They are taking no chances,” 
said Tavares slowly. “They looked 
for you, and when you were not 
to be found, they destroyed your 
home — perhaps you had hidden, 
you see. But now they will look 
some more.” 

In a moment, the sound of the 
explosion reached them. 

The boy began to cry. 

V 

r T , HE sky was full of aircraft, 
-*• high-winged light planes that 
chopped the desert into sector

strips and patrolled them, seeking, 
seeking; helicopters that darted 
from place to place. 

“I never saw so many planes,” 
breathed Joan Bunnell, one arm 
around the boy. He was thrilled, 
so excited that he forgot to be 
afraid; he had never seen so many 
planes either, had hardly believed 
that so many planes existed. 

All through the afternoon, they 
lay there in the waning heat, while 
the searching planes crisscrossed 
the sky. Wakulla looked angry, 
then puzzled, then contemptuous. 
He said: “Stupid! Why don’t they 
follow our tracks? If it was me up 
there, I’d find the jeeps in ten 
minutes!” 

Tavares shrugged. He was very 
silent; he didn’t want to talk, it 
seemed. Hardee and the others 
kept probing at him with ques- 
tions, but he only shook his head. 
The heat was wearing. Even un- 
der the strain of the time, it lulled 
them, drugged them . 

Hardee woke up, and it was 
a cold, bright night. 

The sun had set. 

Overhead, the stars washed 
across the sky. While he watched, 
one larger star — no, not a star; 
the second moon — soared in a 
great wide arc down toward the 
eastern horizon, steel-blue and fa- 
miliar. Hardee squinted up won- 
deringly. If this was not Mars, 
then what was this lesser moon in 
the sky? 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He woke the others. 

The planes were gone and the 
desert was silent. They crept out 
and got into their jeeps and headed 
back toward the demolished pre- 
fab. 

They stopped a couple of hun- 
dred yards away. 

Still in the night, a faint red 
glow and ruddy smoke showed 
where part of the destroyed house 
still smoldered. Hardee caught his 
breath and touched Tavares on 
the shoulder. 

“Look,” he whispered. 

In the starlight, metal glinted. 
It was a wing of the old Ford tri- 
motor. 

The plane was still there! 

For an instant, panic filled them 
all. But there was no sound, only 
their own breathing and the metal- 
lic pinging from the smoldering 
ruin of the house. 

The boy, silent and sleepy, 
stirred restlessly next to his father. 
“My tractor,” he mumbled, and 
was silent. There was no toy trac- 
tor any more. There was no house. 
Only the smoldering metal and 
plastic were left. 

Tavares said quaveringly: “I 
think perhaps they could not get 
the plane off the ground. There 
were helicopters, and it may be 
that they took the crew off with 
them. It is bad sand here for a 
plane.” 

“And maybe it’s a trap!” rum- 
bled Wakulla. 



Tavares said softly: “Yes. May- 
be it is.” 

Hardee said: “We don’t have 
any choice. Let’s take a look.” 

/CAUTIOUSLY they moved up 
^ with the jeeps. Hardee 
backed his near the open door in 
the washboard fuselage; Wakulla 
rolled to a stop a dozen yards 
away and turned his headlights on 
the plane. They climbed onto the 
hood of Hardee’s jeep and peered 
inside. 

Tinkling crystal bells whispered 
in their ears. 

Under the lights from Wakulla’s 
jeep, a metallic scurry of wavy 
jointed legs and of sliding, click- 
ing bodies: the hold of the plane 
was full of skitterbugs. 

Hardee took a deep breath. 

“Come on,” he said. “Let’s look 
around.” 

They clambered into the plane. 

The skitterbugs clicked and 
pinged protestingly underfoot 
Chuck dove for a pair of them and 
came up with them proudly. “Dad- 
dy, can I keep them? I mean now 
that Alfie and Alice are gone?” 

“Sure,” said Hardee gently, and 
set the boy out of the way. To 
Wakulla, he said: “You come with 
me. If there’s anybody left in the 
plane, they’ll probably be up front, 
by the controls—” 

Screech of metal, and a tinny 
crash. 

The door slammed shut. Lights

blazed on inside the plane. The 
elliptical door at the forward end 
of the ship opened and Griswold, 
his haunted eyes staring, peered 
out. 

“There is,” he said. “Welcome 
aboard, all of you.” 

Hardee tensed to jump him, and 
felt Wakulla gathering his muscles 
beside him — but it was too late, 
too late! There was a choking, 
sputtering roar from outside — 
another, and a third; the three en- 
gines were spinning, warming up. 
Griswold stepped back a second 
before their leap and the door 
slammed in their faces. 

As Hardee and Wakulla piled 
up against the elliptical door that 
led to the pilot’s cabin, the en- 
gines shrilled louder and louder. 
The vibrations evened, smoothed, 
were synchronized. 

Then— crash, crash! Two thun- 
dering blows smote them. The 
plane was a croquet ball, and a 
mallet huger than Thor’s slammed 
it forward — bump and bump — 
across the uneven sands. Through 
the one small window left un- 
blocked, they could see the trail of 
exhaust flame from the engines; 
and then, beside that flame and 
below it, a huger, brighter torch 
—a JATO unit, hurling the tired 
old transport up and out and into 
the thin air. 

The JATO rockets flared twen- 
ty yards of heaving flame; and 
then they were dark, but by then 



their work was completely done. 

The plane sagged for a second. 
Waddling in the thin cold air, it 
began lumpishly to climb and gain 
altitude. 

They were trapped. 

A WHILE later, the elliptical 
door opened again briefly— 
long enough for Griswold, carry- 
ing a gun, to come back to join 
them. 

He said heavily: “I was afraid 
we would catch you.” 

He stood regarding them. Queer- 
ly, he seemed more afraid than 
they. “Don’t try anything,” he told 
them, shouting over the racket of 
the motors. “It’s a waste of time. 
You see?” 

And he held open the elliptical 
door for them to look. Through 
it they saw the bucket seats for 
pilot and co-pilot, and what was 
in those seats. And then the door 
was closed again, and Griswold 
was gone. 

Hardee felt a sudden sharp con- 
vulsion in his stomach. He heard 
Wakulla swear and the girl cry 
out and knew that they had seen 
what he had seen: In the seats, 
clinging to a metal grid, a pair of 
skitterbugs. 

And riding on them, like a 
jockey on a horse: Bright bronze 
death’s heads with beady black 
eyes. 

Wakulla rumbled: “What— what 
the hell was that?”

“Martians?” whispered the girl. 
“But, Dom, you said we weren’t 
on Mars!” 

Tavares shrugged. His face was 
quiet and resigned now; he had 
given up. “I didn’t say where we 
were,” he pointed out. “Nor did 
I say what manner of creature 
might be with us.” 

Hardee shook his head to clear 
it. 

His arm was tight around the 
shoulders of the boy. Having him 
there was a help; it made it neces- 
sary for Hardee to think. He 
couldn’t merely give up, for the 
boy’s life was dependent on what 
he did now. 

He tried to reason it out. 

“We are not on Mars,” he said, 
testing the truth of the statement. 
“You’re sure of that, Dom?” 
“Sure?” Tavares laughed. “Can 
you lift three hundred pounds?” 
he asked queerly, his eyes water- 
ing. “Do you see two tiny moons 
in the sky? No, not the big moon. 
That is too big, too bright; that 
might be Earth’s moon, but not 
one of those of Mars!” 

“There are two moons,” Joan 
said reasonably. 

“No.” Tavares shook his head. 
“A moon and a satellite. An orbit- 
ing spaceship, I believe. It is a 
hoax. We were never on Mars.” 

UT what’s the purpose of 
" it?” demanded Hardee. 
Tavares shook his head. “Don’t 



you think I’ve wondered, for five 
years? But I haven’t been able to 
guess. All that I know is that they 
told us this was Mars, but it is 
not. Mars is a red star in the sky. 
I have seen it myself. This I know. 
I know nothing else.” 

“And all these years you haven’t 
said anything?” asked Hardee 
roughly. 

“I have not. Why? For the 
reason that I did not dare, Hardee. 
Yes, I, Tavares, who was once a 
fighter in France, in the war that 
happened before you were born 
— I did not dare. You recall when 
you woke up, eh?” 

“Woke up? You mean the first 
time, before I came to the colony?” 
Hardee nodded. “I remember. I 
was in a room—” 

“Yes,” said Tavares. “That room. 
And you were asked many ques- 
tions, were you not, like the rest 
of us?” 

“I was. Crazy ones.” 

“No, Hardee! Not crazy. They 
were for a purpose. Consider. You 
were asked what you knew about 
Mars— they said it was because 
you were being sent there, eh? 
And you told them, very truly, that 
you knew nothing. I do not know 
what would have happened if, 
by chance, you had been an 
astronomer, or perhaps a journalist, 
and had answered that question 
differently. But I know that you 
would never have come to the 
colony.”

Hardee, frowning, ground out: 
“Go on!” 

“And then they began to de- 
scribe the planet Mars to you— 
to get you ready for your experi- 
ence, they said. Right? They de- 
scribed it just as it turned out- 
in fine, not like Mars itself! And 
they watched you. And you showed 
no signs of doubting them. 

“I know that this is so. For, at 
the time when I awoke, there was 
another with me, also awakened; 
and this one doubted, and let them 
see that he doubted. ‘Mars has a 
light gravity,’ he told them. ‘And 
almost no air! And — ’ Oh, he went 
on and on. 

“It was a mistake. 

“They took him away.” 

Hardee said reasonably: “But 
that doesn’t prove anything, Ta- 
vares. There could have been some 
perfectly simple reason.” 

“I heard him scream!” Tavares 
plunged his face into his hands, 
rocking slowly. “And so all these 
years, I have said nothing, I have 
questioned nothing, for I did not 
dare. But now it is too late to be 
afraid. For that stranger you found, 
Hardee, he proved that all of this is 
a lie. 

“And now the liars must come 
out into the open — at least for us 
here, who know of the lie. And 
the liars— we have seen them.” 
He flung his arm out, pointing 
toward the elliptical door to the 
pilot’s chamber — where they had 



seen the skitterbugs poised calmly 
on their metallic webs, with the 
bronze death’s-head riders perched 
on their shining carapaces. 

The flying antique thumped 
and pounded in strong air cur- 
rents. But it was not airsickness 
that made them feel sick and faint. 

r I , HE elliptical door opened. 

Griswold came back, carrying 
the gun. Behind him they caught 
another glimpse of the skitterbugs 
and their bronze inhuman riders. 

Griswold closed the door and 
called: “Sit down, all of you! 
We’re coming down!” 

“Thanks,” said Hardee shortly. 
“I didn’t expect this much con- 
sideration.” 

Griswold measured him with the 
eyes of a man who knew demons. 
“You blame me,” he said. “Of 
course you do. What can I do 
about it?” 

He motioned Hardee to the 
tiny window. “Look down there,” 
he ordered. “See that city? It’s full 
of skitterbugs — hundreds of thou- 
sands of them! There’s hardly a 
human being alive in it, though it 
used to be full of them. The skit- 
terbugs have taken over!” 

“Taken over?” Hardee echoed, 
puzzled. “Then — are we — ” 

“On Earth, yes.” Griswold 
nodded. “But it doesn’t belong to 
the human race any more. You’ll 
find out.” He stared at Hardee with 
pity and fright. “You could have

lived out your life in the colony,” 
he said somberly, “but you had 
to find that man. Now God knows 
what the bugs will do to you. But 
you’ll never see the colony again.” 

“And neither will you!” bawled 
an enormous voice behind them. 

Griswold spun, trying to bring 
the gun up, but there was no 
time, and the shifting footing of 
crawling bugs beneath them 
tripped him, caught him off bal- 



ance. Wakulla, grinning like a 
maddened gorilla, caught the old 
man with one square hand. The 
gun fell one way and Griswold 
fell the other — out cold. 

“Come on!” shouted Wakulla, 
and dived for the gun. He stum- 
bled knee-deep through the crawl- 
ing little monsters up toward the 
elliptical door. Hardee followed, 
almost without thought. They 
burst through the door-

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Twin bronze creatures turned to 
regard them out of black and hol- 
low eyes. They were small by 
human standards, built like huge 
metallic frogs, golden bronze, with 
tiny limbs and huge faces. They 
rode the skitterbugs, but they were 
not joined to them. One of them 
made a harsh metallic whistling 
sound and flopped off its mount, 
toward something that glittered 
on the floor — a weapon, perhaps. 



HATEVER it was, the 
bronze creature never reached 
it. Wakulla, bellowing madly, 
lunged into the cabin and brought 
his heavy foot down on the crea- 
ture. There was a screech and a 
thin crackling sound; and that 
was the end of that one. 

The other was getting into mo- 
tion by now. But it never had a 
chance. Wakulla steadied himself, 
took aim and fired — again and 




MARS BY MOONLIGHT 



37 




again, pumping bullets at the 
thing, and though his aim was none 
too good, enough of them con- 
nected to splatter the creature 
against the control panels. 

The ancient plane wobbled and 
began to fall off on one wing. 

“Hold on!” bawled Wakulla, and 
grabbed for the control wheel. 

Hardee, panting, fought his way 
into the seat beside him. “Can 
you fly one of these things?” 

“I can try!” said Wakulla, grin- 
ning. Straight ahead of them, 
through the glass, Hardee could 
see a patchwork of trees and 
houses, roads and open land. “I’ll 
land it there!” Wakulla yelled, 
horsing the stick back. 

They hit the ground hard at 
more than a hundred miles an 
hour, bounced, came down on one 
wheel, blew a tire and slid crab- 
wise across an open meadow. If 
there were brakes, Wakulla didn’t 
know where to find them; if there 
was a way to stop the plane be- 
fore it reached the fence at the 
edge of the field, he didn’t know 
it. They hit the brush fence, still 
going fast 

Hardee felt the windshield fly 
up and smack him in the face. The 
last thought he had was: Fire. 

VI 

TT was full morning; he had been 
-*■ unconscious for at least an 
hour. 



Over against the trees, an enor- 
mous smoke plume showed where 
the tri-motor was giving up the 
ghost. Joan Bunnell was leaning 
over him, her cheek bloody, her 
clothing torn. “Hardee, you’re all 
right?” she breathed. 

He pushed himself up. “I guess 
so.” He looked around. “Wakul- 
la-?” 

“His neck was broken.” The 
girl rocked back on her heels. 
Tavares was sitting on the damp 
grass nearby, cradling the boy in 
his lap. Beside him, Griswold lay 
face-down, unmoving. “The rest of 
us are all right,” Joan said. “Gris- 
wold has a bad arm. That’s all.” 
Hardee shook his head and be- 
gan to rub his ears. It felt like 
golf-tees driven into his eardrums; 
the old crate had come down fast 
and the change in pressure was 
bad. He could hardly hear what 
Joan was saying. 

“Poor Wakulla,” she murmured. 
“Maybe he saved our lives.” 

“And maybe he killed us all,” 
said Griswold, painfully turning 
on one side to face them. His face 
was perspiring, and he clutched 
one arm with the other hand. 
“They’ll never let this go by,” he 
warned. 

Hardee got up dizzily and 
strode over to the old man. “Talk!” 
he said. “What are the bugs? 
Where are they from?” 

Griswold said wretchedly: “I 
don’t know. The bugs don’t mat-

ter — it’s the skulls that are im- 
portant. They’re smart. And they 
aren’t from Earth.” 

He sat up, holding his twisted 
arm. In the hot sunlight, the field 
they were in was alive with skit- 
terbugs, flashing and leaping, 
loosed from the wrecked plane. 

Griswold said: “The bugs are 
only brainless machines. They are 
seeded and they grow, and when 
they are large enough, the skulls 
harvest them. Sometimes they use 
human beings for the job of har- 
vesting— like you.” 

TTARDEE walked over to the 
burning plane. The heat kept 
him yards away. Wakulla was in 
there, probably hardly more than- 
a cinder by now, but he couldn’t 
be seen. Just as well, thought 
Hardee. A few skitterbugs, dam- 
aged in the crash, limped broken- 
ly around on the grass, excited by 
the floods of radiant energy from 
the sun and the fire, but unable 
to move very fast. 

And something else metallic lay 
in the grass. 

Hardee bent for it; his head 
thundered, but he kept his balance 
and picked it up. It was the gun 
Wakulla had taken from Griswold. 
Hardee opened it, looked inside 
and swore. 

Only one bullet left. 

But it was better than nothing. 

Back where the others were 
waiting, Tavares was relentlessly 



questioning Griswold. “These crea- 
tures, you say they came from 
space, in that great ship that now 
orbits around the Earth?’ 

“Five years ago,” said Gris- 
wold, nodding. “They have a ray 
—I don’t know how it works. But 
they sprayed the world with it, 
and every living thing went to 
sleep. Some are sleeping yet— 
those that haven’t starved to death, 
though metabolism is slowed con- 
siderably.” 

Hardee looked at Joan Bunnell 
and put his arm protectingly 
around the boy. “Would that be 
October, 1959?” he asked. 

“It would,” said Griswold 
heavily. “You begin to understand, 
I see. That’s what happened to 
all of you at the colony. You 
weren’t criminals— except that, in 
the eyes of the skulls, it’s a crime 
to be human at all.” 

Not criminals! No forgotten 
crime to expiate! Hardee could 
scarcely believe it. But Griswold 
was still talking: 

“They want our planet,” he ex- 
plained. “One shipload came, to 
get things ready, an advance party. 
I don’t know when the rest of 
them will be here — but they’re on 
their way. Perhaps a year or two. 
And they need to have the human 
race under control by then.” 

He rubbed his arm and stared 
up at the sky. “So some of us are 
helping them,” he said flatly. “Call 
us traitors— we are! But what else 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT 



39 



is there to do? The skulls gave us 
a very simple alternative. Either 
we help them study us so that they 
can learn to rule the human race . 
or they go back out into their ship 
and spray the Earth with another 
ray. Not a sleep ray, but one that 
will wipe out all life entirely.” 

G RISWOLD spread his hands. 

“It’s a choice that isn’t any 
choice,” he said. “What else was 
there? So when they woke me — 
I was one of the first few hundred; 
now there must be tens of thou- 
sands — they learned, after we es- 
tablished communication, that I 
was a psychologist. It was exactly 
what they needed. They set me 
the problem of contriving an ex- 
perimental colony — a test farm, if 
you like, where the human animal 
could be kept in conditions as 
close to natural as possible. 

“It was their ship, orbiting out 
there, that made me think of Mars 
— it does look like a second moon. 
Luna was no real problem. A 
simple post-hypnotic command 
and none of you could focus on it 
enough to recognize the features. 
But I couldn’t erase knowledge of 
Mars, if it existed in any of you. 
There is no invention, of course, 
that causes partial— and selective 
—amnesia in criminals. That was 
a lie to make you accept this pla- 
teau as a penal colony on Mars.” 
“But what in hell for?” Hardee 
asked angrily. 



“So nobody would try to es- 
cape. Thinking you were on Mars, 
you wouldn’t hope to get to Earth. 
Knowing you were on Earth, you’d 
do anything to reach civilization 
—not realizing there wasn’t any 
left. Skitterbugs wouldn’t get har- 
vested. Skulls would be killed. The 
colony would be trouble instead of 
useful — and it would then be 
wiped out 

“I wanted to keep as many peo- 
ple alive for as long as I could,” 
said Griswold. “There was no other 
chance for humanity.” 

“What do we do now?” Hardee 
grimly demanded. 

Griswold hesitated. “There are 
a few free humans,” he said reluc- 
tantly. “Not many. They live in 
the woods, in hiding, some of them 
in the cities themselves. Mostly 
they are ignored by the skulls — 
because there are so few. If there 
weren’t, the skulls would take the 
easy way out. The Earth is their 
new home, you see, and they re- 
gard it as you would your house. 
You might tolerate a few vermin 
—but if there are too many, you’ll 
call in the exterminators. But there 
are these few, and if we can some- 
how make our way to them, we 
might have a chance to—” 

“Hush!” breathed Joan Bunnell. 
She caught the boy to her, point- 
ing. Out of the woods at the side 
of the field raced a posse of skit- 
terbugs, each with its bronze 
death’s-head rider.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Hardee tried to fight, though 
there were hundreds of the crea- 
tures. If Wakulla had not been so 
profligate with his bullets— 

But he had been; and the single 
bullet in the gun was more frus- 
trating than none at all. 

“Too late,” groaned Griswold, 
his tortured face sagging with fear. 
“Give up, Hardee! Otherwise 
they’ll kill us right here!” 

r 1 1 HEY were marched down a 
road and into the environs of 
a city, the skitterbugs with their 
bright bronze riders a disorderly 
rabble around them. 

None of them recognized the 
city; it might have been anywhere. 
It was a silent city, a city of 
death. Even from the streets, they 
could see men and women who 
had been struck down in the mid- 
dle of life. A mother with three 
children around her, sprawled in a 
Laocoon down porch steps; a post- 
man with his two-wheeled cart be- 
side him, his letters long since 
blown away. 

And there were living, waking 
humans too. Chuck shivered and 
caught his father’s arm as they 
rounded a corner and saw a work 
gang — ten or twelve men, in rags 
of clothing, clearing rubble from 
a tumbled house that lay across a 
side street; they looked up as 
Hardee and the rest passed, but 
there was no emotion in their 
eyes, only weariness. 



“Those others,” whispered Joan. 
“Are they dead?” 

“No,” said Tavares heavily, “not 
if what Griswold tells us is true. 
But they might as well be. Un- 
less—” 

“Don’t even think it!” begged 
Griswold. “Some of the skulls can 
understand English!” 

“Let them understand!” cried 
Hardee. He stopped and faced 
them. “We’ll fight you!” he shouted. 
“You can’t have our planet— not 
now or ever! The human race isn’t 
going to be taken over by a bunch 
of bugs from another planet!” 

Incuriously, the blank-eyed 
bronze skulls stared at him; almost 
as incuriously, the ragged men 
looked on. 

The skulls prodded Hardee on, 
and the ragged men went back to 
their work. 

The prisoners were taken to a 
big building that bore on it a sign, 
Hotel Winchester. Once it had 
been a commercial hotel; now it 
seemed to be headquarters for the 
skitterbugs and the skulls that rode 
them. 

Without a word, they were put 
in a room on a gallery that over- 
looked the lobby. The floor of the 
lobby was a seething mass of skit- 
terbugs with their riders— and some 
skulls which had found a different 
sort of mount, for they perched on 
the shoulders of ragged men. 

The door was closed, and they 
were left alone. 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT

I T was a partly glass door; Har- 
dee peered out. “They must 
have come from a light-gravity 
planet,” he guessed. “They move 
badly without the skitterbugs. 
They can’t be very strong.” 

“They don’t need to be,” said 
Griswold somberly. “Not with their 
weapons.” 

“What about at night?” asked 
Hardee. “Surely the skitterbugs 
can’t operate very well without 
light. Can’t we—” 

But Griswold was shaking his 
head. “They keep all the areas 
of the city where they move about 
well lighted. No, Hardee. The 
skulls are way ahead of you.” He 
sat down and sighed. “I think 
they’ll kill us,” he said without 
emotion. “It’s either that or the 
labor gangs.” 

Old man Tavares said some- 
thing incandescent in Spanish. 
“You may die, Griswold, but I’ll 
fight Look, why can we not get 
away? Soon it will be dark, as 
Hardee says, and it is then only 
a matter of getting away from the 
lighted areas. Why not?” 

“Wait,” Hardee interrupted, star- 
ing out the glass of the door. 
“Someone’s coming.” 

They crowded around. 

Down the long gallery that sur- 
rounded the lobby, a tall man with 
angry eyes approached. 

Hope surged — a human, and 
free! 

But then they saw that on his 



shoulder rode one of the bronze 
skulls, motionless, the hollow eyes 
emptily staring. 

“He is probably our execu- 
tioner,” said Griswold, as though 
announcing the time of day. 

“Not without a fight,” said Har- 
dee tensely. “Tavares, you stand 
over here. I’ll wait on the other 
side. Joan, you take Chuck to the 
far side of the room. See if you 
can make the skull look at you! 
And Griswold—” 

“It won’t work,” said Griswold 
stubbornly, but he went with Joan 
and the boy. 

The door opened. 

As soon as the man and his 
rider were inside, Hardee lunged 
against the door, slammed it shut. 
“Now!” he shouted, and leaped 
toward the pair. 

The angry eyes of the man 
opened wide in astonishment. 
Hastily he stepped back. “Wait!” 
he cried, stumbling— 

And the bronze skull toppled 
from his shoulder. 

It rolled across the room and 
lay motionless on the floor. 

TTARDEE jumped for it as 
though it were a hand 
grenade, fallen back into his own 
rifle pit; but the new man with 
the angry eyes yelled: “Don’t 
waste your time! That one’s dead 
—I killed it myself!” 

Hardee brought up short, gap- 
ing. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The man grinned tightly. “It 
keeps the others from bothering 
me,” he explained. “Don’t mess 
it up — we’ll need it to get out of 
here. Come on!” 

“Where?” asked Hardee, trying 
to take it in. It was hope, it was 
rescue — when they had expected 
it least. 

“Down the end of the gallery,” 
said the man, “there’s a linen 
closet. In it is a laundry chute. It 
goes down to the cellar. The skulls 
don’t go there much— the lights are 
bad; we keep them that way. And 
there are sewers and passages. If 
we reach the chute, we’re safe.” 

He opened the door, peered out 
“You go ahead, all of you. I’ll 
follow, as though I’m taking you 
somewhere.” He closed the door 
and bent down to recover his skull. 
“Mustn’t forget Oscar,” he said. 
“He’s our passport.” 

He opened a leather strap that 
passed around his neck and shoul- 
der, bound it around the dead 
skull, buckled it again. Experi- 
mentally he bowed slightly from 
the waist. The skull wobbled but 
stayed on. 

“Don’t jar me,” he said, and 
crossed his fingers. He opened the 
door a crack, looked down the 
corridor and nodded. 

“Let’s go!” he said, and flung 
it wide. 

The procession moved down the 
gallery. Dust was thick on the 
leather settees that lined it; the 



skulls had no need for them, and 
no human without a skull possess- 
ing it had passed that way in five 
years. There were skitterbugs with 
skulls upon them at the end of the 
gallery, but they didn’t seem to 
notice anything. Down in the lob- 
by, a few of the men with skull 
riders glanced up, but no one chal- 
lenged. 

It was twenty yards to the door 
of the linen closet. 

Fifteen yards were easy. 

Then, out of a ballroom that 
was now a pen for the human 
slaves of the skulls, two skitter- 
bugs with skulls upon them came 
out They paused and then one of 
them opened its queerly articu- 
lated transverse mouth and made 
a sound, a chanting metallic whine 
—speaking to the skull on the 
shoulder of their rescuer. 

Hardee caught Joan’s arm, took 
a tighter grip on the hand of the 
boy by his side, lengthening his 
stride. So near! And then — 

Q UICK as lightning, the skit- 
terbug with the skull on it 
leaped forward and clutched at the 
legs of the man who was shepherd- 
ing them. 

He kicked it away. “Rim!” he 
yelled. 

The skull on his shoulder fell 
free and bumped lifelessly away. 
Three more skulls, riding skitter- 
bugs, popped out of the ballroom. 
Down on the lobby floor there was 



MARS BY MOONLIGHT 



43 



a stirring and a whining commo- 
tion. 

“Run!” he yelled again, and 
shoved them powerfully forward 
to the linen closet. 

They made the door, just in 
time. It was the size of a small 
room, and they all crammed in- 
side. 

Hardee slammed the door and 
held it “Jump! I’ll stay here and 
keep them out.” 

The boy cried out once, then 
was silent. He glanced at his father 
as Tavares and the other man 
lifted him into the chute; but he 
didn’t say a word when they let 
go and he slid out of sight 

“Go ahead, Joan!” barked 
Hardee. 

Restless scratchings outside told 
him the skitterbugs were there. 
Then he could feel the door press- 
ing against him. He cursed the 
clever, economical designers of the 
building, who had known better 
than to put a lock on the inside of 
a linen closet. If there had been 
one, they could all escape. But 
since there was not— 

Griswold glanced at the chute, 
looked at Hardee, and nervously 
tongued his dry lips. 

Tavares was in the chute now; 
he waved, and dropped out of 
sight. 

Griswold turned his back on the 
chute. 

He walked over to Hardee. “I’ve 
got a broken arm,” he said, “and, 

44 



you know, I’m not sure the free 
humans would welcome me. You 
go, Hardee.” 

“But-” 

“Go ahead!” Griswold thrust him 
away. There was more strength 
than Hardee had expected in the 
worn, injured body. “I doubt I 
could make it anyway, with this 
arm— but I can hold them for a 
minute!” 

Already the other man was 
gone; it was only Griswold and 
Hardee there, and the scratching 
and shoving were growing more 
insistent 

“All right,” said Hardee at last 
“Griswold—” 

But he didn’t know what it was, 
exactly, that he wanted to say; 
and besides, there was no time. 

Griswold, sweat pouring into his 
eyes, chuckled faintly for the first 
time since Hardee had known 
him. 

“Hurry!” he said, and looked 
embarrassed as he held up two 
fingers in a shaky V. But he looked 
embarrassed only for an instant 
The fingers firmed into a spiky, 
humanly stubborn, defiant sign of 
victory. “Save the children,” Gris- 
wold said. “I couldn’t get the skulls 
to let many into the colony — a 
waste, they told me, because kids 
can’t work. Save the children!” 

Hardee turned away — toward 
the laundry chute, and toward a 
new life.

convulsed, he snapped up a fresh 
ten thousand and proceeded to 
chomp and grind on them. Black 
Sorter was rugged. 

The rejected envelope was 
tongued up by Red Subsorter, who 
growled deep in his throat, said a 
very bad word, and passed it to 
Yellow Rerouter, who passed it 
to Green Rerouter, who passed it 
to Brown Study, who passed it to 
Pink Wastebasket. 

Unlike Black Sorter, Pink 
Wastebasket was very delicate, 
though highly intuitive— the ma- 
chine equivalent of a White Rus- 
sian countess. She was designed 
to scan in 3,137 codes, route spe- 
cial-delivery spacemail to inter- 
planetary liners by messenger 
rocket, and distinguish 9s from up- 
side-down 6s. 

Pink Wastebasket haughtily in- 
haled the offending envelope and 
almost instantly turned a bright 
crimson and began to tremble. 
After a few minutes, small atomic 
flames started to flicker from her 
mid-section. 

White Nursemaid Seven and 
Greasy Joe both received Pink 
Wastebasket’s distress signal and 
got there as fast as their wheels 
would roll them, but the high-born 
machine’s malady was beyond 



their simple skills of oilcan and 
electroshock. 

T HEY summoned other ma- 
chine-tending-and-repairing ma- 
chines, ones far more expert than 
themselves, but all were baffled. 
It was clear that Pink Wastebas- 
ket, who continued to tremble and 
flicker uncontrollably, was suffer- 
ing from the equivalent of a major 
psychosis with severe psychoso- 
matic symptoms. She spat a stream 
of filthy ions at Gray Psychiatrist, 
not recognizing her old friend. 

Meanwhile, the paper blizzard 
from Black Sorter was piling up 
in great drifts between the dark 
pillars of the sublevel, and flurries 
had reached Pink Wastebasket’s 
aristocratic area. An expedition of 
sturdy machines, headed by two 
hastily summoned snowplows, was 
dispatched to immobilize Black 
Sorter at all costs. 

Pink Wastebasket, quivering like 
a demented hula dancer, was 
clearly approaching a crisis. Final- 
ly Gray Psychiatrist— after con- 
sulting with Green Surgeon, and 
even then with an irritated reluc- 
tance, as if he were calling in a 
witch-doctor— summoned a human 
being. 

The human being walked re- 
spectfully around Pink Wastebas- 
ket several times and then gave 
her a nervous little poke with a 
rubber-handled probe. 

Pink Wastebasket gently regur-

gitated her last snack, turned dead 
white, gave a last flicker and shake, 
and expired. Black Coroner re- 
corded the immediate cause of 
death as tinkering by a human 
being. 

The human being, a bald and 
scrawny one named Potshelter, 
picked up the envelope responsible 
for all the trouble, stared at it in- 
credulously, opened it with trem- 
bling fingers, scanned the contents 
briefly, gave a great shriek and 
ran off at top speed, forgetting to 
hop on his perambulator, which 
followed him making anxious 
clucking noises. 

The nearest human representa- 
tive of the Solar Bureau of In- 
vestigation, a rather wooden-look- 
ing man named Krumbine, also 
bald, recognized Potshelter as soon 
as the latter burst gasping into his 
office, squeezing through the door 
while it was still dilating. The hu- 
man beings whose work took them 
among the Top Brass, as the up- 
per-echelon machines were some- 
times referred to, formed a kind 
of human elite, just one big ner- 
vous family. 

“Sit down, Potshelter,” the SBI 
Man said. “Hold still a second so 
the chair can grab you. Hitch onto 
the hookah and choose a tran- 
quilizer from the tray at your el- 
bow. Whatever deviation you’ve 
uncovered can’t be that much of 
a danger to the planets. I imagine 
that when you leave this office, 



the Solar Battle Fleet will still be 
orbiting peacefully around Luna.” 

“I seriously doubt that” 

"POTSHELTER gulped a large 
-*• lavender pill and took a deep 
breath. “Krumbine, a letter turned 
up in the first-class mail this morn- 
ing.” 

“Great Scott!” 

“It is a letter from one person 
to another person.” 

“Good Lord!” 

“The flow of advertising has 
been seriously interfered with. At 
a modest estimate, three hundred 
million pieces of expensive first- 
class advertising have already been 
chewed to rags and I’m not sure 
the Steel Helms— God bless ’em!— 
have the trouble in hand yet.” 

“Judas Priest!” 

“Naturally the poor machines 
weren’t able to cope with the let- 
ter. It was utterly outside their 
experience, beyond the furthest 
reach of their programming. It 
threw them into a terrible spasm. 
Pink Wastebasket is dead and at 
this very instant, if we’re lucky, 
three police machines of the tough- 
est blued steel are holding down 
Black Sorter and putting a muzzle 
on him.” 

“Great Scott! It’s incredible, Pot- 
shelter. And Pink Wastebasket 
dead? Take another tranquilizer, 
Potshelter, and hand over the 
tray.” 

Krumbine received it with

trembling fingers, started to pick 
up a big pink pill but drew back 
his hand from it in sudden revul- 
sion at its color and swallowed 
two blue oval ones instead. The 
man was obviously fighting to con- 
trol himself. 

He said unsteadily, “I almost 
never take doubles, but this news 
you bring— Good Lord! I seem to 
recall a case where someone tried 
to send a sound-tape through the 
mails, but that was before my 
time. Incidentally, is there any pos- 
sibility that this is a letter sent 
by one group of persons to an- 
other group? A hive or a therapy 
group or a social club? That would 
be bad enough, of course, but—” 

“No, just one single person send- 
ing to another.” Potshelter’s ex- 
pression set in grimly solicitous 
lines. “I can see you don’t quite 
understand, Krumbine. This is not 
a sound-tape, but a letter written 
in letters. You know, letters, char- 
acters— like books.” 

“Don’t mention books in this 
office!” Krumbine drew himself up 
angrily and then slumped back. 
“Excuse me, Potshelter, but I find 
this very difficult to face squarely. 
Do I understand you to say that 
one person has tried to use the 
mails to send a printed sheet of 
some sort to another?” 

“Worse than that. A written let- 
ter.” 

“Written? I don’t recognize the 
word.” 



“It’s a way of making characters, 
of forming visual equivalents of 
sound, without using electricity. 
The writer, as he’s called, employs 
a black liquid and a pointed stick 
called a pen. I know about this 
because one hobby of mine is an- 
cient means of communication.” 

RUMBINE frowned and shook 
■*-*- his head. “Communication is 
a dangerous business, Potshelter, 
especially at the personal level. 
With you and me, it’s all right, be- 
cause we know what we’re doing.” 
He picked up a third blue tran- 
quilizer. “But with most of the 
hive-folk, person-to-person com- 
munication is only a morbid form 
of advertising, a dangerous traves- 
ty of normal newscasting— cathar- 
sis without the analyst, recitation 
without the teacher— a perversion 
of promotion employed in betray- 
ing and subverting.” 

The frown deepened as he put 
the blue pill in his mouth and 
chewed it. “But about this pen- 
do you mean the fellow glues the 
pointed stick to his tongue and 
then speaks, and the black liquid 
traces the vibrations on the paper? 
A primitive non-electrical oscillo- 
scope? Sloppy but conceivable, 
and producing a record of sorts of 
the spoken word.” 

“No, no, Krumbine.” Potshelter 
nervously popped a square orange 
tablet into his mouth. “It’s a hand- 
written letter.” 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Krumbine watched him. “I never 
mix tranquilizers,” he boasted ab- 
sently. “Hand-written, eh? You 
mean that the message was im- 
printed on a hand? And the skin 
or the entire hand afterward de- 
tached and sent through the mails 
in the fashion of a Martian re- 
proach? A grisly find indeed, Pot- 
shelter.” 

“You still don’t quite grasp it, 
Krumbine. The fingers of the hand 
move the stick that applies the 
ink, producing a crude imitation 
of the printed word.” 

“Diabolical!” Krumbine smashed 
his fist down on the desk so that 
the four phones and two-score 
microphones rattled. “I tell you, 
Potshelter, the SBI is ready to 
cope with the subtlest modern de- 
ceptions, but when fiends search 
out and revive tricks from the pre- 
Atomic Cave Era, it’s almost too 
much. But, Great Scott, I dally 
while the planets are in danger. 
What’s the sender’s code on this 
hellish letter?” 

“No code,” Potshelter said dark- 
ly, preferring the envelope. “The 
return address is— hand-written.” 
Krumbine blanched as his eyes 
slowly traced the uneven lines in 
the upper left-hand comer: 

from Richard Rowe 
215 West 10th St (horizontal) 
2837 Rocket Court (vertical) 
Hive 37, NewNew York 319, N. Y. 

Columbia, Terra 



“Ugh!” Krumbine said, shiver- 
ing. “Those crawling characters, 
those letters, as you call them, 
those things barely enough like 
print to be readable— they seem to 
be on the verge of awakening all 
sorts of horrid racial memories. I 
find myself thinking of fur-clad 
witch-doctors dipping long pointed 
sticks in bubbling black cauldrons. 
No wonder Pink Wastebasket 
couldn’t take it, brave girl.” 

T^IRMING himself behind his 
-*■ desk, he pushed a number of 
buttons and spoke long numbers 
and meaningful alphabetical syl- 
lables into several microphones. 
Banks of colored lights around the 
desk began to blink like a theatre 
marquee sending Morse Code, 
while phosphorescent arrows 
crawled purposefully across maps 
and space-charts and through three- 
dimensional street diagrams. 

“There!” he said at last. “The 
sender of the letter is being appre- 
hended and will be brought di- 
rectly here. We’ll see what sort of 
man this Richard Rowe is — if we 
can assume he’s human. Seven 
precautionary cordons are being 
drawn around his population sta- 
tion: three composed of machines, 
two of SBI agents, and two con- 
sisting of human and mechanical 
medical-combat teams. Same goes 
for the intended recipient of the 
letter. Meanwhile, a destroyer 
squadron of the Solar Fleet has 



THE LAST LETTER 



49 



been detached to orbit over New- 
New York.” 

“In case it becomes necessary to 
Z-Bomb?” Potshelter asked grimly. 

Krumbine nodded. “With all 
those villains lurking just outside 
the Solar System in their invisible 
black ships, with planeticide in 
their hearts, we can’t be too care- 
ful. One word transmitted from 
one spy to another and anything 
may happen. And we must bomb 
before they do, so as to contain 
our losses. Better one city de- 
stroyed than a traitor on the loose 
who may destroy many cities. One 
hundred years ago, three person- 
to-person postcards went through 
the mails — just three postcards, 
Potshelter! — and pit went Sche- 
nectady, Hoboken, Cicero, and 
Walla Walla. Here, as long as 
you’re mixing them, try one of 
these oval blues — I find them best 
for steady swallowing.” 

Bells jangled. Krumbine 
grabbed up two phones, holding 
one to each ear. Potshelter auto- 
matically picked up a third. The 
ringing continued. Krumbine 
started to wedge one of his phones 
under his chin, nodded sharply at 
Potshelter and then toward a 
cluster of microphones at the end 
of the table. Potshelter picked up 
a fourth phone from behind them. 
The ringing stopped. 

The two men listened, looking 
doped, Krumbine with an eye 
fixed on the sweep second hand of 



the large wall clock. When it had 
made one revolution, he cradled 
his phones. Potshelter followed 
suit. 

“I do like the simplicity of the 
new on-the-hour Puffyloaf phono- 
commercial,” the latter remarked 
thoughtfully. “The Bread That’s 
Lighter Than Air. Nice.” 

Krumbine nodded. “I hear 
they’ve had to add mass to the 
leadfoil wrapping to keep the 
loaves from floating off the shelves. 
Fact.” 

TTE cleared his throat. “Too bad 
we can’t listen to more phono- 
commercials, but even when there 
isn’t a crisis on the agenda, I find 
I have to budget my listening 
time. One minute per hour strikes 
a reasonable balance between duty 
and self-indulgence.” 

The nearest wall began to sing: 

Mister J. Augustus Krumbine, 
We all think you’re fine, fine, 
fine, fine. 

Now out of the skyey blue 
Come some telegrams for you. 

The wall opend to a small heart 
shape toward the center and a 
sheaf of pale yellow envelopes 
arced out and plopped on the mid- 
dle of the desk. Krumbine started 
to leaf through them, scanning the 
little transparent windows. 

“Hm, Electronic Soap . Better 
Homes and Landing Platforms...

Psycho-Blinkers . Your Girl 
Next Door . Poppy- W oppiet 
. Poopsy-Woopsies . 

He started to open an envelope, 
then, after a quick look around 
and an apologetic smile at Pot- 
shelter, dumped them all on the 
disposal hopper, which gargled 
briefly. 

“After all, there is a crisis this 
morning,” he said in a defensive 
voice. 

Potshelter nodded absently. “I 
can remember back before per- 
sonalized delivery and rhyming 
robots,” he observed. “But how I’d 
miss them now — so much more 
distingue than the hives with their 
non-personalized radio, TV and 
stereo advertising. For that matter, 
I believe there are some backward 
areas on Terra where the great ad- 
vertising potential of telephones 
and telegrams hasn’t been fully 
realized and they are still used in 
part for personal communication. 
Now me, I’ve never in my life 
sent or received a message except 
on my walky-talky.” He patted his 
breast pocket. 

Krumbine nodded, but he was 
a trifle shocked and inclined to re- 
vise his estimate of Potshelter’s so- 
cial status. Krumbine conducted 
his own social correspondence 
solely by telepathy. He shared 
with three other SBI officials a 
private telepath — a charming al- 
bino girl named Agnes. 

“Yes, and it’s a very handsome 



walky-talky,” he assured Potshel- 
ter a little falsely. “Suits you. I 
like the upswept antenna.” He 
drummed on the desk and swal- 
lowed another blue tranquilizer. 
“Dammit, what’s happened to 
those machines? They ought to 
have the two spies here by now. 
Did you notice that the second — 
the intended recipient of the letter, 
I mean — seems to be female? 
Another good Terran name, too, 
Jane Dough. Hive in Upper Man- 
hattan.” He began to tap the en- 
velope sharply against the desk. 
“Dammit, where are they?” 

“Excuse me,” Potshelter said 
hesitantly, “but I’m wondering 
why you haven’t read the message 
inside the envelope.” 

K rumbine looked at him 
blankly. “Great Scott, I as- 
sumed that at least it was in some 
secret code, of course. Normally 
I’d have asked you to have Pink 
Wastebasket try her skill on it, 
but . .” His eyes widened and 
his voice sank. “You don’t mean to 
tell me that it’s—” 

Potshelter nodded grimly. 
“Hand-written, too. Yes.” 

Krumbine winced. “I keep try- 
ing to forget that aspect of the 
case.” He dug out the message 
with shaking fingers, fumbled it 
open and read: 

Dear Jane, 

It must surprise you that I know

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



your name, for our hives are widely 
separated. Do you recall day before 
yesterday when your guided tour of 
Grand Central Spaceport got stalled 
because the guide blew a fuse? 1 
was the young man with hair in the 
tour behind yours. You were a little 
frightened and a groupmistress was 
reassuring you. The machine spoke 
your name. 

Since then I have been unable to 
forget you. When I go to sleep, I 
dream of your face looking up sadly 
at the mistress’s kindly photocells. 
I don’t know how to get in touch 
with you, but my grandfather has 
told me stories his grandfather told 
him that his grandfather told him 
about young men writing what he 
calls love-letters to young ladies. So 
I am writing you a love-letter. 

I work in a first-class advertising 
house and I will slip this love-letter 
into an outgoing ten-thousand-pack 
and hope. 

Do not be frightened of me, Jane. 
I am no caveman except for my 
hair. I am not insane. I am emotion- 
ally disturbed, but in a way that no 
machine has ever described to me. 
/ want only your happiness. 

Sincerely, 

Richard Rowe 

Krumbine slumped back in his 
chair, which braced itself man- 
fully against him, and looked long 
and thoughtfully at Potshelter. 
“Well, if that’s a code, it’s cer- 
tainly a fiendishly subtle one. 



You’d think he was talking to his 
Girl Next Door.” 

Potshelter nodded wonderingly. 
“I only read as far as where they 
were planning to blow up Grand 
Central Spaceport and all the 
guides in it.” 

“Judas Priest, I think I have it!” 
Krumbine shot up. “It’s a pilot 
advertisement — Boy Next Door 
or — that kind of thing — printed 
to look like hand-writtening, which 
would make all the difference. 
And the pilot copy got mailed by 
accident — which would mean 
there is no real Richard Rowe.” 

At that instant, the door dilated 
and two blue detective engines 
hustled a struggling young man 
into the office. He was slim, rather 
handsome, had a bushy head of 
hair that had somehow survived 
evolution and radioactive fallout, 
and across the chest and back of 
his paper singlet was neatly 
stamped: “Richard Rowe.” 
When he saw the two men, he 
stopped struggling and straightened 
up. “Excuse me, gentlemen,” he 
said, “but these police machines 
must have made a mistake. I’ve 
committed no crime.” 

Then his gaze fell on the hand- 
addressed envelope on Krum- 
bine’s desk and he turned pale. 

1Z"RUMBINE laughed harshly. 
XV “N 0 crime! No, not at all. 
Merely using the mails to com- 
municate. Ha!” 



THE LAST LETTER 



53 



The young man shrank back. 
“I’m sorry, sir.” 

“Sorry, he says! Do you realize 
that your insane prank has re- 
sulted in the destruction of per- 
haps a half-billion pieces of first- 
class advertising? — in the strang- 
ulation of a postal station and the 
paralysis of Lower Manhattan? — 
in the mobilization of SBI re- 
serves, the de-mothballing of two 
divisions of G. I. machines and 
the redeployment of the Solar 
Battle Fleet? Good Lord, boy, 
why did you do it?” 

Richard Rowe continued to 
shrink but he squared his shoulders. 
“I’m sorry, sir, but I just had to. 
I just had to get in touch with 
Jane Dough.” 

“A girl from another hive? A 
girl you’d merely gazed at because 
a guide happened to blow a fuse?” 
Krumbine stood up, shaking an 
angry finger. “Great Scott, boy, 
where was Your Girl Next Door?” 

Richard Rowe stared bravely at 
the finger, which made him look 
a trifle cross-eyed. “She died, sir, 
both of them.” 

“But there should be at least 
six.” 

“I know, sir, but of the other 
four, two have been shipped to 
the Adirondacks on vacation and 
two recently got married and 
haven’t been replaced.” 

Potshelter, a faraway look in 
his eyes, said softly, “I think I’m 
beginning to understand—” 



But Krumbine thundered on at 
Richard Rowe with, “Good Lord, 
I can see you’ve had your troubles, 
boy. It isn’t often we have these 
shortages of Girls Next Door, so 
that temporarily a boy can’t marry 
the Girl Next Door, as he always 
should. But, Judas Priest, why 
didn’t you take your troubles to 
your psychiatrist, your groupmas- 
ter, your socializer, your Queen 
Mother?” 

“My psychiatrist is being over- 
hauled, sir, and his replacement 
short-circuits every time he hears 
the word ‘trouble.’ My groupmas- 
ter and socializer are on vacation 
duty in the Adirondacks. My 
Queen Mother is busy replacing 
Girls Next Door.” 

“Yes, it all fits,” Potshelter pro- 
claimed excitedly. “Don’t you see, 
Krumbine? Except for a set of 
mischances that would only occur 
once in a billion billion times, the 
letter would never have been con- 
ceived or sent” 

“You may have something 
there,” Krumbine concurred. “But 
in any case, boy, why did you — 
er — written this letter to this par- 
ticular girl? What is there about 
Jane Dough that made you do 
it?” 

“Well, you see, sir, she’s—” 

J UST then, the door re-dilated 
and a blue matron machine 
conducted a young woman into 
the office. She was slim and she 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



had a head of hair that would have 
graced a museum beauty, while 
across the back and — well, “chest” 
is an inadequate word — of her 
paper chemise, “Jane Dough” 
was silk-screened in the palest 
pink. 

Krumbine did not repeat his 
last question. He had to admit to 
himself that it had been answered 
fully. Potshelter whistled respect- 
fully. The blue detective engines 
gave hard-boiled grunts. Even the 
blue matron machine seemed awed 
by the girl’s beauty. 

But she had eyes only for 
Richard Rowe. “My Grand Cen- 
tral man,” she breathed in amaze- 
ment. “The man I’ve dreamed of 
ever since. My man with hair.” 
She noticed the way he was look- 
ing at her and she breathed harder. 
“Oh, darling, what have you done?” 
“I tried to send you a letter.” 
“A letter? For me? Oh, darling!” 

TZ RUMBINE cleared his throat. 
•*-*- “Potshelter, I’m going to 
wind this up fast. Miss Dough, 
could you transfer to this young 
man’s hive?” 

“Oh, yes, sir! Mine has an over- 
plus of Girls Next Door.” 

“Good. Mr. Rowe, there’s a sky- 
pilot two levels up — look for the 
usual white collar just below the 
photocells. Marry this girl and 
take her home to your hive. If 
your Queen Mother objects refer 
her to — er — Potshelter here.” 



He cut short the young people’s 
thanks. “Just one thing,” he said, 
wagging a finger at Rowe. “Don’t 
written any more letters.” 

“Why ever would I?” Richard 
answered. “Already my action is 
beginning to seem like a mad 
dream.” 

“Not to me, dear,” Jane cor- 
rected him. “Oh, sir, could I have 
the letter he sent me? Not to do 
anything with. Not to show any- 
one. Just to keep.” 

“Well, I don’t know—” Krum- 
bine began. 

“Oh, please, sir!” 

“Well, I don’t know why not, I 
was going to say. Here you are, 
miss. Just see that this husband 
of yours never writtens another.” 
He turned back as the contract- 
ing door shut the young couple 
from view. 

“You were right, Potshelter,” he 
said briskly. “It was one of those 
combinations of mischances that 
come up only once in a billion 
billion times. But we’re going to 
have to issue recommendations for 
new procedures and safeguards 
that will reduce the possibilities to 
one in a trillion trillion. It will 
undoubtedly up the Terran in- 
come tax a healthy percentage, but 
we can’t have something like this 
happening again. Every boy must 
marry the Girl Next Door! And 
the first-class mails must not be 
interfered with! The advertising 
must go through!” > 



THE LAST LETTER 



55 



“I’d almost like to see it happen 
again,” Potshelter murmured 
dreamily, “if there were another 
Jane Dough in it.” 

i~kUTSIDE, Richard and Jane 
^ had halted to allow a small 
cortege of machines to pass. First 
came a squad of police machines 
with Black Sorter in their midst, 
unmuzzled and docile enough, 
though still gnashing his teeth 
softly. Then — stretched out hori- 
zontally and borne on the shoul- 
ders of Gray Psychiatrist, Black 
Coroner, White Nursemaid Seven 
and Greasy Joe — there passed the 
slim form of Pink Wastebasket, 
snow-white in death. The machines 



were keening softly, mournfully. 

Round about the black pillars, 
little mecho-mops were scurrying 
like mice, cleaning up the last of 
the first-class-mail bits of confetti. 

Richard winced at this evidence 
of his aberration, but Jane 
squeezed his hand comfortingly, 
which produced in him a truly 
amazing sensation that changed 
his whole appearance. 

“I know how you feel, darling,” 
she told him. “But don’t worry 
about it. Just think, dear, I’ll al- 
ways be able to tell your friends’ 
wives something no other woman 
in the world can boast of: that my 
husband once wrote me a letter!”

answering for humanity any better than Ernie Meeker does? 

In Stephen Barr's THE BACK OF OUR HEADS, there is an astonishing 
female traveler who goes from life to death and back again like a commuter 
on the 5:15... except that each trip brings her nearer the beginning of the 
line! 

INNOCENT AT LARGE by Poul and Karen Anderson lands a hayseed 
Martian among big-planet slickers, where, of course, he is bound to get 
into trouble. But that's nothing compared to the trouble he will be in if he 
does not get into trouble! 

Short stories — no less than three and probably more. Our usual

twelve books on Atlantis you have 
read — at least eight of the twelve 
must have told you that a com- 
plete list of all the books on At- 
lantis in all languages would com- 
prise more than 2000 titles, plus 
an estimated 25,000 papers and 
articles, not counting, of course, 
popularizations of such books and 
papers. 

A new book on Atlantis, then, 
rehashing the old ideas, is highly 
unlikely to cause any excitement. 
If I am going to discuss one here, 
it is because it contains a number 
of new ideas. It increases the 
“newsworthiness,” if that is the 
proper term to use under the cir- 
cumstances, that the book does not 
yet exist in English translation. 

There is a personal note to the 
story. Several years ago, at a 
science fiction convention, some- 
body asked my opinion about the 
claim of a North German pastor 
that he, or rather a diver whom 
he had hired, had found the ruins 
of Atlantis on the bottom of the 
North Sea. I replied at the time 
that I doubted very much that 
he had found Atlantis, but that 
I would not hesitate for a moment 
to accept the statement that he had 
found ruins of buildings. 

The shoreline of the eastern end 
of the North Sea, where it is 
bounded by Denmark and portions 
of Germany, had shifted consider- 
ably in what we would call early 
historical times if we were talk- 



ing about the eastern shore of 
the Mediterranean Sea. The local 
inhabitants always were full of 
stories of sunken cities in the area, 
and by “always” I do not mean 
my father’s or my grandfather’s 
time but the time, more than 300 
years ago, when early local 
chroniclers put these stories on 
paper. 

However, I decided to find out 
more about it. The first trouble 
was that the man who told me 
about the claim did not recall the 
pastor’s name. More by chance 
than by anything else, I found out 
that the name is Jurgen Spanuth 
— which should be pronounced 
Shpah-NOOT — after which it was 
easy to establish the title of the 
book. Then I wrote to Germany 
for a copy. My correspondent “re- 
gretted exceedingly,” but the book 
was out of print. 

r T , HREE weeks later, I received 
a telephone call from a pub- 
lishing house in New York. They 
had been sent a new German 
book on Atlantis and would I 
care to read it for them? Charm- 
ing coincidence, I thought, and said 
yes. 

The book came. Its author’s 
name was Otto H. Muck and it 
turned out to be a hair-raising 
manipulation of scientific facts, 
very nearly as bad as Velikovsky. 
Then, frankly, I forgot about Pas- 
tor Spanuth. But last year his book 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was reprinted, which fact came to 
my attention via a book review. 

Now, armed with a copy, I can 
tell about his ideas. But, knowing 
that not every one of my readers 
will have read a dozen books on 
Atlantis, I must sketch in the back- 
ground first 

The sole source of the whole 
Atlantis story is a Greek philoso- 
pher who died in 347 B.C. and is 
believed to have been born in 427 
B.C. His name was Aristokles, but 
he was nicknamed Platon (with 
reference to his broad shoulders) 
and used Platon as his name in 
later life. For reasons not known 
to me, the final “n” dropped out 
in most languages (though Rus- 
sian and French retain it), so 
that he is now known as Plato. 
The Atlantis story appeared in his 
works in two places, in the so- 
called “dialogues”— the term “dis- 
cussions” would be far more cor- 
rect-named Timaios and Kritias. 

The first of the two does not 
contain much more than the state- 
ment that there once was a coun- 
try called Atlantis and that the 
Atlanteans invaded the eastern 
Mediterranean. They were, the 
story says, very successful at first, 
but were finally beaten by the 
Athenians. 

In the second “dialogue,” the 
one called Kritias, the Atlantis 
theme reappears with a detailed 
description of the main city, the 
king’s castle and so forth. The 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Kritias is an unfinished work, but 
it is not a case of a fragment hav- 
ing been lost. We have what Plato 
wrote, but at a crucial point he 
stopped writing. 

Later writers — writers of the 
twentieth century, that is — have 
made a sentimental tale of this. 
They have made it appear as if 
the aged philosopher, using his last 
strength, tried to pass on a great 
secret to his followers, but that 
death overtook him in the middle 
of the work. 

T>EFORE you shed any tears 
■*“* over this tragedy, let me as- 
sure you that the unfinished Kritias 
is not Plato’s last work. A careful 
reading of the piece makes it per- 
fectly clear what happened. 

The logic of the development 
calls for chastising the Atlanteans, 
even though it is not clear why 
they should be chastised, since 
their “crimes” are hardly worse 
than anybody else’s. But while 
Plato built up toward the chastise- 
ment, he must have realized that, 
according to his own earlier state- 
ment, they had not just been 
chastised but had been wiped out, 
destroyed utterly. There was 
simply no way out of this dilemma, 
so Plato put the unfinished manu- 
script aside and wrote (and fin- 
ished) the Laws. 

As has been mentioned, Plato is 
the sole source of the Atlantis 
story. Nobody before him used

Athanasius Kircher, published 1678. North is at bottom of map 



the name; nobody at his time did; 
nobody after him did without ref- 
erence to Plato. Plato’s own pupil 
Aristotle did not take it literally 
and later classical writers, as, for 
example, Pliny the Elder, put the 
whole burden of the proof on 
Plato’s broad shoulders. 

Now the first of the two “dia- 
logues” is actually a discussion on 
Pythagorean philosophy. The peo- 
ple taking part in it are Socrates 
and three of his friends, named 
Timaios, Kritias and Hermokrates. 
The discussion is laid at about the 
time when Plato was born, pre- 
sumably as a device so that he 
could keep himself out of it. 

After some preliminaries, one 



of the speakers tells that Solon 
traveled to Egypt at the time when 
a king whom the Greeks call 
Amasis (meaning Aahmes II) 
ruled the country. In reality, 
Aahmes II did not rule when the 
(historical) Solon traveled to 
Egypt. The trip must have been 
some time between 593 B.C. and 
583 B.C, while Aahmes II became 
king more than a dozen years later, 
in 570 B.C. 

However, this is a minor detail. 
The Egyptian priests tell Solon 
that “she”— the goddess Isis of the 
Egyptians, who is taken to be the 
same as the goddess Athena of 
the Greeks— founded “this city” 
(Sa'is) 8000 years ago and “your 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



city” (Athens) a thousand years 
earlier. 

Of course, neither city was 
founded at such an early date. 
This discrepancy, which Plato’s 
readers would have spotted at 
once, is explained away with a 
tale of recurring catastrophes that 
destroyed the original cities. 

The story, still relating what the 
Egyptian priests are supposed to 
have said, goes on to tell about 
a large island in the Atlantic 
Ocean. Strangely enough, this 
statement about the ocean is ac- 
companied by a remark that it 
“was then navigable.” 

The name of that island, at any 
event, was Atlantis and on it there 
was “a great and wonderful em- 
pire which had rule over the whole 
island and several others, as well 
as over parts of the continent . .” 
After having spread to lands bor- 
dering the Mediterranean, “vast 
power thus gathered into one, en- 
deavored to subdue at one blow 
our country and yours . .” One by 
one, the cities or nations were sub- 
dued, except for the Athenians who 
“defeated and triumphed over the 
invaders, and preserved from 
slavery those who were not yet 
subjected.” 

Then a catastrophe wiped out 
the Athenian army and, simul- 
taneously, the entire island of 
Atlantis. 

This is as far as the Timaios 
goes about Atlantis. 



IN the later Kritias, there is a 
detailed description of the gen- 
ealogy of the kings of Atlantis— de- 
scended from the gods, of course 
— and of the royal city and the 
palace. I am not going to waste 
any space repeating this descrip- 
tion here. It is sufficient to say that 
the whole tenor of it is to show that 
the Atlanteans were mighty and 
rich. Especially the abundance of 
metal is stressed, gold and silver 
and bronze and orichalcum (we 
don’t know what was meant by 
this word, but it is clearly stated 
that only gold was more valuable). 

After Plato had given all the 
details of the land and the palace, 
he obviously found himself at a 
loss. The “dialogue” goes on for 
roughly another printed page and 
stops at the instant when Zeus is 
ready to pronounce sentence. 

After reading all this, you had 
the following choices: 

The first one was to consider the 
whole an allegory for purposes of 
philosophical discussion. This is 
what most, if not all, people did 
until a few hundred years ago. 

The second choice was to take 
every word at face value, which 
meant assuming a major catas- 
trophe that destroyed a large is- 
land, almost a small continent, in 
the past. But if you wanted to take 
the second choice, you quickly ran 
into a few difficulties, of which the 
very first was the dating. 

According to the Timaios, the

goddess founded the original 
Athens 9000 years before Solon’s 
visit to Egypt, which would be 
about 9600 b.c. in our method of 
dating. But in the Kritias, Atlan- 
tis was destroyed 9000 years ago, 
leaving no time for the Atlanteans 
to be defeated by the warriors of 
the newly founded city. Or else 
the other way round: leaving no 
time for the newly founded city to 
grow and to produce an army 
which could defeat such a mighty 
invader. 

Also, if you wanted to take the 
second choice, you still did not 
know where to put Atlantis, for the 
story only says that it was in the 
ocean beyond the Pillars of Her- 
cules. Nothing is actually said 
about direction.

Father Athanasius Kircher, in 
1678, drew a map which has be- 
come standard (Fig. 1) for genera- 
tions of Atlantomanes, but al- 
though the legend on the map says 
that it followed Plato’s descrip- 
tion, this happens to be somewhat

exaggerated. There just is not that 
much description. 

Now if you did not want to take 
the first choice because this was 
much too simple, and found that 
you could not actually follow the 
second one, there remained a third 
choice, namely to try to find out 
what Plato “really” meant. “Ob- 
viously” he had slipped some place, 
either as far as directions or as 
far as chronology are concerned. 
The third choice is what produced 
about 2000 books in not quite 300 
years. 

I must have read at least 
thirty of them and each one re- 
quired a rather drastic “suspen- 
sion of disbelief’ to follow the 
reasoning of the author. 

However, there still remained 
what might be called choice nu- 



mero 1 B. It runs about as fol- 
lows: 

Granted that Plato wrote an 
allegory for philosophical purposes, 
we might look for actual facts 
which he utilized. Writers hardly 
ever invent something out of their 
imagination only. If they describe 
a person, they have a real person 
in mind, one they know, have 
heard or read about. If they de- 
scribe a train crash, they have a 
real one in mind or at the very 
least the fact that there are 
train crashes. Calling such direct 
or indirect memories “sources,” one 
could legitimately ask what 
“sources” Plato had used. 

This particular line of ques- 
tioning was caused by one fact that 
was noticed early. His description 
of the royal palace of Atlantis

bears a most striking resemblance 
to Scheria, the city of the Phaia- 
kians in Homer’s Odyssey. Schol- 
ars have established as many as 
thirty points of agreement between 
the two cities. And the Odyssey 
had its present form long before 
Plato was born. 

That Homer, in turn, is assumed 
to have had a “source,” namely an 
actual city, probably Tartessos in 
Spain, is not too important at this 
point. At least this item of Plato’s 
story had a definite source. 



One could even go farther and 
say that if Homer did have Tar- 
tessos, the Tarshish of the Bible, 
in mind for his city of Scheria and 
if Plato knew this, then the idea 
of the destruction came from the 
same source. For, in the Odyssey, 
Scheria is an existing city in the 
far west. In Plato’s time, the actual 
city no longer existed. 

Other such “sources” could be 
found quickly. The idea of re- 
curring catastrophes was Baby- 
lonian. That there were earth- 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



quakes, Plato knew from personal 
experience. One which happened 
in Greece too early for his per- 
sonal memory— he must have been 
in the crawling stage at the time- 
inundated and partly destroyed a 
small Greek island. The name of 
that island was Atalante. In short, 
among his direct and indirect 
memories there was the fabulous 
city, the catastrophe and even the 
name! Everything else was an ex- 
position of his own philosophy. 

Well, where does Pastor Span- 
uth come in? 

Pastor Spanuth, in my opinion, 
has succeeded in discovering an- 
other very important “source” for 
Plato. 

In the first place, he revised the 
chronology. Those 8000 or 9000 
years which Plato was throwing 
around made no sense historically. 
But the Egyptians, even quite re- 
cently, went by 30-day periods of 
calendar determination, based on 
the phases of the Moon. They 
counted 12 such periods as the 
year of their neighbors. 

Now if the figure of 8000 re- 
fers to 8000 such 30-day periods 
—of which a visiting Greek may 
not be aware — we get an actual 
figure of 666 years. Since Solon’s 
visit was around 580 B.C., the 
time of the invasion comes out to 
about 1250 B.C., with a leeway of 
a number of years, since the 8000 
was clearly rounded off in one 
direction or the other. 



HP HE invasion would fall in the 
reign of Rameses II “the 
Great,” who died in 1225 B.C., af- 
ter a 67-year rule, at the age of 
about 90. There is no such event 
in his lifetime. But only about 50 
years later, under the rule of 
Rameses III, there was a major 
invasion of Egypt and nearby 
countries. 

The invaders were the Libyans, 
assisted by the “sea peoples.” 
Rameses III later did produce the 
“documents” about which Solon 
spoke. They can still be seen on 
the walls of the temple at Medinet 
Habu. No doubt there was a major 
invasion at that time and large- 
scale battles. 

The “sea peoples” (Fig. 2, 3 
and 4) do look rather familiar. 
Their tribes, in the inscriptions, 
are named Pherest, Saskar and 
Denen. 

Pastor Spanuth thinks that this 
is the way an Egyptian scribe 
would have expressed the tribal 
names which, in English, read 
Frisians, Saxons and Danes. 

If large groups of North Euro- 
peans started moving southward, 
the result could well be what Plato 
said in a highly condensed form. 
They would move comparatively 
slowly, over many years, if possible 
making friends with the people 
they met — the Libyans of the 
Egyptian records — and finally at- 
tack the rich lands, Egypt and the 
neighboring Hittite Empire. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



65 



The historical facts are that the 
Hittite Empire broke up at just 
that time and Egypt was severely 
threatened but managed to sur- 
vive. The attackers, as later his- 
tory had demonstrated repeatedly, 
would probably win for a long 
time but weaken themselves in 
the process until a final battle, 
which might be comparatively 
minor, breaks their back. It may 
have been Athens that broke it 

A small side issue is what hap- 
pened to the “sea peoples” after 
their final defeat. Pastor Spanuth 
makes an interesting suggestion. 
The Hebrew version of the Pherest 
is phelestim. Philistines. 

I have to mention that Pastor 
Spanuth does not claim the credit 
for having thought of all this first. 
The revised dating was first sug- 
gested by the Swedish polyhistor 
Olaus Rudbeck in 1675. The idea 
that the invasion experienced by 
Rameses III might have been the 
“source” of the invasion told by 
Plato was suggested first by the 
German philologist Prof. W. Christ 
in 1886 and immediately after- 
ward (and independently) by the 
English historian K. T. Frost. 

Well, the Egyptian pictures are 
pretty convincing — these pictures, 
incidentally, were originally pub- 
lished by James Henry Breasted 
in a book Ancient Records ot 
Egypt, Chicago 1906. Plato’s 
“sources” now begin to take on a 
well-rounded look. 



CO far, I find myself in whole- 
^ hearted agreement with the 
material collected by Pastor Span- 
uth. But he goes farther. 

Since the “sea peoples” were a 
Danish-Frisian army, bringing 
horned helmets, round shields, a 
special kind of sword and amber 
(Spanuth takes Plato’s orichalcum 
to mean amber, which is very like- 
ly correct) to the eastern Mediter- 
ranean, then the place Plato 
named Atlantis must have been 
in the Danish-Frisian area. 

His idea is that in, say, 
1300 b.c. and earlier, there was 
an empire in the north, compris- 
ing present-day Denmark and 
southern Sweden with the islands 
in between. Its capital, with the 
king’s castle, was in the western 
part of this empire, near the sea, 
which in this case would be the 
North Sea. The present island of 
Helgoland is taken to be the west- 
ern headland of this section. The 
king’s castle was inland from 
there. 

There are quite a number of 
single facts which he can quote. 

This area was the original amber 
country; the larger amber de- 
posits of East Prussia were not 
discovered until much later, at 
the time of Emperor Nero of 
Rome. 

Helgoland once was much big- 
ger. In 1650, one Johannes Meyer 
drew a map based on local legends 
(Fig. 5). It may be somewhat 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



exaggerated in size, but it does 
give an idea of how much dry 
land there was in the eastern North 
Sea in times still dimly remem- 
bered several hundred years ago. 
The coastline did fluctuate and, 
at one time, one might have been 
able to walk from present Helgo- 
land to present Denmark. 

OASTOR Spanuth thinks the 
*- king’s castle was located to the 
east of the present-day Helgo- 
land, in an area labeled Stein- 
grund (stony bottom) on current 
nautical charts. Indubitably there 
are ruins of buildings and walls in 
the Steingrund. But that they were 
a king’s castle still remains to be 
proved, if it can be proved. 

As regards the catastrophe, Pas- 
tor Spanuth can, of course, say 
that the Steingrund now is at the 
bottom of a sea, though the water 
is not very deep. He does make 
the interesting statement that the 
great exaggeration that crept into 
Plato’s story could be due to a 
simple linguistic confusion. 

Supposing, Pastor Spanuth said, 
as in the case of Rome, the name 
of the empire and of its capital 
had been the same? If the city 
of Rome had been destroyed, say 



by a volcanic eruption, somebody 
with a taste for bigness could un- 
derstand that the whole Roman 
Empire had been burned in a su- 
per-colossal catastrophe if some- 
body said “Rome is destroyed.” 
Pastor Spanuth does think that the 
king’s castle, “in one bad night 
and one day,” as Plato has it, 
sank beneath the waves and he as- 
sumes that the castle and capital 
gave its original name, whatever 
it was, to the whole empire. 

On principle, I am in favor of 
a very thorough investigation of 
the Steingrund with modern means 
of underwater salvage. The results 
would be rewarding in any case. 

I don’t think that Pastor Span- 
uth’s thesis that this was the old 
Danish-Frisian empire’s capital, 
which Plato named Atlantis, will 
be borne out. If it should be, how- 
ever, I shall bow before a bril- 
liant piece of reasoning with some 
luck thrown in, as has happened 
in the case of Schliemann’s dis- 
covery of Troy. 

In the meantime, I am satis- 
fied that Spanuth’s diligent read- 
ing has turned up the identity of 
the warriors from “Atlantis” who 
invaded Egypt in 1200 B.C.

only a Venusian and a scrawny, 
shrunken one at that. But he in-

dicated polite amusement. He 
toyed idly with the gem-encrusted 
hilt of his whirlarang and made 
a courteous observation. 

“I see,” he said, diplomatically 
changing the subject, “that the 
monster has been this way.” He 
sat up and sniffed. That was not 
necessary; both of them had long 
ago detected the rancid reek of 
the monster. 

The Slide said moodily: “I wish 
that fellow ahead of us would play 
through so we could get on with 
our game.” The fruit of the tree 
overhead tinkled merrily in the 
soggy wind. 

Popagator stood up and made 
a couple of practice tosses, whish- 
ing air noisily through his bony 
mouth-cavity. It was the equiva- 
lent of a nonchalant whistle. The 
whirlarang spun up into the cloudy 
air, hovered, sailed high, dipped 
and returned to his hands. 

He caught The Slide’s eye and 
said apologetically: “A little slop- 
py on the back-spin, I’m afraid.” 

The Slide grumbled unwilling- 
ly: “No, it would have been a ten- 
pointer at least. You’re at the top 
of your form today, Popagator. I 
wish we could get this game over 
with.” 

1 1 ''HE Venusian ahead of them, 
-*■ it was true, was taking an un- 
godly length of time to play the 
eighth square. He was slumped 
against a dike that held a water 



trap, in the middle of the looped 
grove of twiny trees that made 
the eighth square such a tricky 
over-and-under shot. His head was 
down, as though he were asleep, 
and his whirlarang was not in his 
hand. 

“Inconsiderate,” growled The 
Slide. 

In truth, it was. No doubt the 
fellow was taking a little rest, too, 
just as they were, but, all the 
same, it was very far from being 
sportsmanlike. 

Popagator frowned — well, no. 
He couldn’t frown any more than 
he could smile, for much the same 
reasons. It takes loose folds of flesh 
either to smile or to frown. There 
are no loose folds on a Venusian’s 
face; in fact, there is no external 
flesh at all, or none to speak of, 
since they are arthropods. 

Popagator caught another whiff 
of the sour monster odor and 
coughed chokingly. To take his 
mind off it, he clattered his whirla- 
rang noisily from “hand” to 
“hand,” admiring the play of light 
from the sparkling facets set into 
the hilt. 

Venusians are all great ad- 
mirers of point sources of light, 
since the clouds of their atmos- 
phere make such common objects 
as sun and stars completely un- 
known to them. And Popagator’s 
whirlarang, gemmed like a Phar- 
aoh, was a particularly noble in- 
strument. It had been in his 



70 



GA LAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



family for one hundred and nine 
generations. 

Popagator stroked the worn hilt 
reminiscently, thinking of the 
splendid comeback he had made 
on square five when, trailing by 
a point and a half, he had thrown 
a perfect triple reverse to catch 
up in points and lead in time. 

All Venusians are skilled in the 
use of the whirlarang; Popagator 
could not remember a day, since 
his first dim memories as a tiny 
imago, when it had not been an 
obsession with him— first as a mat- 
ter of theory, then, as he passed 
the larval and soft-bodied stages 
and developed the hard limbs that 
came with adult life, as a matter 
of hourly, daily and incessant prac- 
tice. It was a major fact in the 
life of every Venusian. They had 
very little else to do. 

The whirlarang itself was basi- 
cally the same instrument that 
Australian bushmen, forty million 
miles away, had themselves de- 
veloped in the dawn of their crude 
culture. But where loinclothed 
savages had found only a hunting 
instrument and a weapon of war, 
Popagator’s enormously cultured 
race had refined it, had redesigned 
and rebuilt it out of a complex 
assortment of materials far beyond 
the resources of a savage, and had 
surrounded it with a code of be- 
havior and rules that turned a 
whirlarang round into a contest 
as complicated and as absorbing 



as chess or contract bridge, with 
the added requirements of strength 
and enormous physical skill. 

66 T AM tired,” rasped The 
Slide, “of waiting for that 
fellow to play through! They 
shouldn’t allow singles anyway.” 

Popagator soothed: “Let us 

walk forward to the next square. 
That is polite, not ill-mannered. 
And perhaps it will remind him 
that we are waiting.” 

He moved forward over the 
sandy, spongy ground with a 
clickety-click of his bony mem- 
bers, The Slide click-scratching 
moodily along behind. The closer 
they got to the silent Venusian on 
square eight, the stronger the fetid, 
repulsive monster stench became. 

“Whew,” choked The Slide. “If 
I had known it was going to be 
this bad, I never would have—” 

He stopped. 

Both stopped, not only speech 
but movement. 

There was a reason why the idle 
Venusian on square eight was not 
playing through, and the reason 
was this: 

He was dead. 

His hand-member was split 
open, and so was his lolling head. 
Bluish tricklings of brain and 
nervous tissue leaked nastily out. 
His whirlarang was missing. 

Dead. 

Murdered. 

Popagator looked at The Slide, 



THE GENTLEST UNPEOPLE 



71 



and The Slide stared with all of 
his eyes at Popagator. 

“Murder,” said Popagator at 
last. “It’s a case for the Justice 
Machines.” 

The Slide nodded— well, no. But 
he gave assent, in the way cus- 
tomary to Venusians. 

“It is murder,” he echoed. “We 
must report this with all possible 
haste.” 

“Right,” Popagator agreed. 
“Well, play, friend! We’ve got 
fourteen squares to go and we 
must hurry. We must notify the 
Justice Machines the very mo- 
ment we finish!” 

II 

r T , HE monster sat on the tail 
strut of his rocket, whistling. 
He turned over the whirlarang he 
had taken from the Venusian, ad- 
miring the play of light on the 
rubies and diamonds set into its 
handle. 

“Son of a gun,” he said aloud, 
hiccoughing. “This sure beats 
working for a living!” He tilted 
a stainless steel flask to his lips 
and belched happily. 

The monster’s name was David 
T. Jiminez, and he was a certi- 
fied space explorer in the employ 
of the I.G.Y. He tossed the whirla- 
rang into the air and clumsily 
caught it. He was forty-nine years 
old, and for the first time in his 
life he was sublimely happy. 



Jiminez emptied the flask and 
tossed it away. “Hi-diddle-de-dee,” 
he sang. “The spaceman’s life for 
me!” 

He banged the whirlarang 
against the side of his rocket, hic- 
coughed, frowned and thought for 
a second. That wasn’t such a good 
idea. Jiminez had no very good 
idea of just how fragile the hull 
of a rocketship was— “I don’t dig 
that science jazz,” he had told the 
I.G.Y. personnel office disarming- 
ly— but, you never know, maybe 
he might knock a hole in it. Why 
take a chance? There was plenty 
of junk around. 

He prowled through a heap of 
parts, tools and instruments that 
were tossed rusting on the sea- 
green moss. There was a black 
box, forearm length, with a hinged 
lid; on it was stenciled: 

CAUTION 

Contents Fragile. Stow in padded 
locker. Protect against jolts and jars. 

He opened the lid, hefted the 
silvery tube inside thoughtfully, 
nodded and began to bang it 
against the whirlarang, trying to 
loosen the gems from their setting. 

A clicking, rasping voice from 
behind him said inquiringly: “O 
Monster?” 

Jiminez turned around belliger- 
ently. It was one of the damned 
bugs— naturally; there weren’t any 
other human beings in this part of 



72 



GA LAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Venus. That was what made it 
so nice. 

Jiminez disliked people, but he 
couldn’t stand the bugs. It wasn’t 
so bad that they were more or 
less the shape of a human being, 
or even that they lived in houses 
like human beings, used tools like 
human beings, even operated ma- 
chinery like human beings— and 
kinds of machinery that, in some 
cases, humans couldn’t quite 
match, or even understand. 

What was really bad was that 
they talked like human beings. 

That, in Dirty Davey Jiminez’s 
opinion, was pretty gaw-dam up- 
pity of them, giving themselves 
airs. He had no idea that the 
Venusians did it from motives of 
purest politeness, since humans 
had shown themselves unable to 
grasp the barest fundamentals of 
the Venusian tongue. 

He snarled, “Beat it, you.” 

T'iELICATELY turning away 
from Jiminez’s breath, the 
Venusian said apologetically, “O 
Monster, I am Popagator. Isn’t 
that the whirlarang of Wnota- 
gashti the Drum?” 

“You bugs gimme a pain,” Jimi- 
nez said impatiently. “How’m I 
supposed to know?” 

“Wnotagashti the Drum has 
been killed,” the Venusian ex- 
plained helpfully. “His head was 
split open. You were in the area 
just before it happened.” 



Jiminez thought for a moment, 
weaving slightly. “Oh, yeah, that. 
I tell you what happened, bus- 
ter. I took it off him and he give 
me an argument. Well, I lost my 
temper. I mean it was a gaw-dam 
case of deliberate and insupport- 
able rudeness, and if there’s one 
thing I can’t stand, it’s a lot of 
gaw-dam rudeness. You know how 
it is. So I bashed him.” 

The Venusian moved incon- 
spicuously to windward. He said 
compassionately: “A terrible or- 
deal, O Monster. Wnotagashti the 
Drum must have been deranged.” 
“That’s what I thought,” Jimi- 
nez agreed. “Now why don’t you 
beat it so I can get a little work 
done around here?” 

“Certainly. But — O Monster, 
there is one thing.” 

“Now what? Ain’t you got any 
consideration? I got plenty on my 
mind already, you know.” 

“The Justice Machines,” said 
Popagator apologetically. “My 
whirlarang companion, The Slide, 
has notified them of the accident 
to Wnotagashti the Drum. They 
will surely investigate you, O 
Monster.” 

Jiminez straightened up with 
faint alarm. “What the devil you 
talking about?” he demanded. 

Popagator whished air noisily 
through his mouth-cavity for a 
second in a disarming way. He 
said: “It is their function, O Mon- 
ster. They are devices, like those 



THE GENTLEST UNPEOPLE 



73 



which you call ‘harness bulls.’ One 
will come to interview you in this 
matter, perhaps quite soon.” 

“But the little rat gimme a 
hard time!” Jiminez protested, his 
stomach moving queasily. What 
was wrong here? Had he made a 
mistake of some sort? He said: 
“Dint you hear me? I only took 
the stinking thing away from him. 
And right away he argues with 
me! Talk about bad manners, 
bub, I tell you this was the worst.” 

“I understand,” Popagator sym- 
pathized. “It is very clear, O Mon- 
ster. You need only tell this to 
the Justice Machine, that is all. 
But I wished to notify you that 
it was coming, as an act of 
courtesy.” 

“Sure,” said Jiminez, ungra- 
ciously, but feeling slightly more 
relaxed. “All right now, would you 
do me a favor and get lost? I 
got things to do, Charley. I can’t 
spend the whole day talking to 
every lousy bug that comes along, 
understand?” 

“I understand, O Monster,” 
Popagator said in grave apology. 
“Good-by.” 

MINEZ pawed around the 
junk on the ground until he 
found another flask and took a 
long pull on it. 

Confidence flowed back into 
him. He wiped his lips and sat 
down for a moment to rest— well, 
no. He sat down to finish the jug. 



Jiminez had not always been a 
paid space-traveler for the Inter- 
national Geophysical Year (as it 
was still quaintly called). For 
thirty-five years of his life, in fact, 
he had been a jockey. 

That was all behind him now 
—mostly because of the trouble 
the State Board gave him in New 
York over the 1983 running of 
the Belmont ’Cap. The nag in- 
volved was named Heuristic Har- 
ry, and when he beat the finest 
three-year-olds of his day by six 
lengths, naturally there were ques- 
tions. The benzedrine sulfate they 
found in Heuristic Harry’s saliva 
provided some of the answers, and 
that was the end of the line for 
Jiminez’s career as a jockey, at 
least in that part of the world. 

A setdown jockey pushing fifty 
doesn’t have many chances to 
make a living. And even some- 
body like Jiminez doesn’t like to 
resign himself to starving to death. 

He tried Mexico for a while, 
but there were all too many set- 
down jocks fighting for mounts 
there, and not much money any- 
way. Jiminez had got used to a 
lot of money. 

And then, when he saw the 
ad, he had drifted toward the 
I.G.Y. district office. It seemed 
that fewer than one man in ten 
thousand had the peculiar genetic 
constitution that made it possible 
for him to endure the cosmic radia- 
tion that killed off most humans. 




74 



GA LAXY SCI ENCE FICTION 



It seemed further that small men 
-ex-jocks, for example— were par- 
ticularly useful for space travel, 
since they didn’t take as much 
room. 

Jiminez still laughed out loud 
when he remembered the person- 
nel officer’s face. The man had 
stared silently at a blank wall for 
nearly five minutes, his mouth 
working soundlessly, with Jimi- 
nez’s completed test forms in front 
of him. But finally he had signed 
them, stamped them “Approved” 
and turned his back until Jiminez 
was out of the room. It looked, 
thought Jiminez, as though they 
were having real trouble finding 
the kind of men they needed. 

So— well, first he had tried to 
hold them up for double the usual 
pay, and failed; he had listened 
to an appeal to his sense of altru- 
ism and dedication to human 
progress from another I.G.Y. man, 
laughed in the man’s face and 
drifted away. 

But there wasn’t much else to 
do, and that was a fact. 

And then he had been stuck in 
a hotel room, wondering how to 
get out without paying the rent. 
And there had been a magazine. 
Jiminez wasn’t much of a reader, 
but it was a long wait until the 
night desk clerk would sneak out 
for a quick beer, so he painfully 
spelled out the article on the first 
Venusian exploration parties. 

And then Jiminez realized just 



what opportunities were open to 
him under the auspices of the 
I.G.Y.’s space-exploration program. 

TTURLING the second empty 
flask away, Jiminez stood up, 
wobbling. 

He picked up the whirlarang 
from the ground and, still carry- 
ing it, lurched over to the vats he 
had scrabbled out of the soggy 
Venusian soil. It was a ritual with 
him; nearly every time he finished 
a flask, he inspected the progress 
of his mash, to make sure that 
there would be more when that 
was gone. 

The mash had stopped bub- 
bling. Nearly all the fermentation 
was over; it was almost time to 
dip out the sour juice and distill 
it. There would be, he calculated 
with difficulty, somewhere upward 
of fifty gallons of what you could 
call either beer or wine, as you 
chose, for him to push through 
the still. 

It was a good little still. It had 
been designed by some very high- 
priced talent to meet the needs 
of explorers for safe, potable 
water, and it worked just as well 
for Jiminez’s purposes. It would 
give a high, powerful yield. Call 
it ten gallons of approximately 
hundred-proof brandy — if you 
wanted to call it brandy. Some- 
times he thought of it as whiskey, 
sometimes as gin; it didn’t really 
resemble anything on Earth. But 



THE GENTLEST UNPEOPLE 



75 



it would be ten gallons of some- 
thing. 

At a quart a day— and he could 
make do with that— it would carry 
him through another month and 
leave a two-week supply, or near- 
ly, for the return flight to Earth. 

That was very good. In another 
month, it would be just about time 
to take off for Earth again, ac- 
cording to the pre-set flight pat- 
terns built into the rocket’s con- 
trols. And by then he would be 
ready. 

Grinning happily, Jiminez 
lurched back to the ship and 
tossed the whirlarang into the open 
hatch. It landed with a splinter- 
ing crash— some metal-and-glass 
object had been in the way and 
was now a thousand fragments— 
and one of the sparkling jewels 
was dislodged. 

It rolled away under the sturdy 
legs of the tripod that held the 
silent pressure-temperature-humid- 
ity recorder. But that didn’t mat- 
ter; he would find the jewel be- 
fore he took off. Because then he 
would take out that recorder— 
along with a lot of other junk the 
I.G.Y. people had installed— and 
leave it to rust on the soil of 
Venus. 

He had already tossed out about 
half the stuff; there was plenty of 
time to get rid of the rest. Those 
things weighed plenty. What Jimi- 
nez wanted was to get rid of 
them. In the first place, all those 



clever and expensive little devices 
would be of no use at all to the 
I.G.Y.— because Jiminez’s landing 
plan did not involve a return to 
the Yuma, Arizona, base where 
he was expected. It was his no- 
tion to land in either New Zealand 
or the Belgian Congo. And in the 
second place, he needed all the 
weight he could save. 

The glittering facets of the 
whirlarang were diamonds and 
rubies. The whirlarang itself was 
hollow platinum. 

He had already acquired near- 
ly six hundred pounds of assorted 
gems and precious metals, and it 
was necessary to balance that 
weight, now tossed carelessly into 
the ship, by an equal weight of 
unnecessary junk removed. 

TT was all easy, amazingly easy. 

These funny-looking bugs that 
were the dominant race on Venus 
were just too polite to refuse any- 
thing. They never said no. They 
never stopped him, no matter what 
he did. 

Jiminez began ladling fermen- 
tation liquor into the pot of the 
still. He was sweating profusely 
in the warm, wet air, but he didn’t 
mind, not at all. The bugs lived 
in a sort of tinplate Utopia; all 
their major needs were cared for 
by machines, running soundlessly 
out of sight and providing food, 
power, clothes, homes. According 
to the magazine article, they had 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lived that way for a thousand 
generations, since the time they 
nearly destroyed their planet in a 
war and substituted a code of po- 
liteness and a driving interest in 
games for more dangerous ways 
of life. 

It worked out very nicely, what- 
ever the reason. He walked into 
their houses and took away their 
very cooking utensils, and they 
didn’t do a thing. The cook-pots 
were spun platinum. 

He shinnied up the side of the 
largest structure in their town— 
a triangular tower four stories 
high; embedded zircons and topaz 
were his footholds and grips, and 
at the top were fourteen diamonds 
of a hundred carats and up. He 
pried them from their settings and 
the bugs didn’t do a thing. 

He pulled two hundred meters 
of silver wire out of the municipal 
power plant— that was before he 
caught onto the fact that silver 
was a waste of time— and for five 
days the town was without elec- 
tricity, until the automatic ma- 
chines were able to replace it. And 
the Venusians still didn’t do a 
thing. 

Only the bug this morning, the 
one he’d taken the whirlarang 
away from, he had acted up. 

Jiminez rested from his labors. 
He poured himself a shot of his 
last batch of brew, held his nose, 
threw it down, retched briefly 
and felt it take hold. He pon- 



dered cloudily: Would there be 
any trouble about that? 

Probably not, he thought. Let 
the Justice Machine come. As the 
other bug had said, he had an 
iron-clad case. 

Anyway, he thought belligerent- 
ly, let them try! It was plain self- 
defense, because how did he know 
what the bug was trying to do? 
Those whirlarang gadgets could 
kill somebody, couldn’t they? And 
the bugs were pretty good with 
them. And— 

Well, anyway. If the Justice 
Machine did come— and he was 
pretty sure it never would; it 
was just a bug bluff— he would out- 
line the situation in a few simple 
words and it would go away again. 
That was all there was to it. The 
bug had, surprisingly, refused to 
yield the whirlarang— apparently 
it was only in the games that they 
acted normally selfish, greedy and 
competitive. So naturally he had 
hit the bug. He had to admit that 
maybe he wouldn’t have done it 
if it hadn’t been for a certain hang- 
over. But he hadn’t realized that 
the bugs could be killed quite so 
easily. 

It was a plain accident, of 
course. 

Besides, it was self-defense. 

Furthermore, they wouldn’t do 
anything about it. 

He was very sure of that, right 
up to the moment when he heard 
the clattering and clanking of some- 



THE GENTLEST UNPEOPLE 



77 




thing big and mechanical coming 
out of the charred second-growth 
vines that were already spring- 
ing up around his rocket, and an 
enormous metallic creation on 
wheels, with about a million wav- 
ing arms and limbs, rolled dan- 
gerously up to him. And, wham, 
zowie, the limbs were all around 
him. 

Dirty Davey Jiminez whooped 
and screamed and fought, but it 
didn’t do a bit of good. The Jus- 
tice Machine wasn’t listening. It 
carried him away. He was caught, 
fair and square. 

Ill 

T HE monster named Jiminez 
howled to the unfeeling ma- 
chine: “You can’t do this to me! 
I demand a mouthpiece. I’m prac- 
tically an ambassador, don’t you 
know that? I work for the gaw- 
dam International Geofistical 
Year! Ever hear of it, damn you? 
Sure you have! That’s an official 
government thing in the United 
Nations, buster, and they got lots 
of moxie back on Earth. They’ll 
have a fleet of warships down 
here so fast, it’ll make your head 
spin! I mean—” He stopped, con- 
fused. The machine had no head. 

Jiminez sat down and tried to 
think. He had a hangover that was 
getting worse with every minute, 
but it was time to do some think- 
ing. 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The machine had carried him, 
hollering and wriggling as much 
as he could, but whatever he did, 
it was no use; the machine was 
built to handle adult Venusians, 
and it managed a mere monster 
without effort or strain. It had 
taken him to the triangular tower. 
A door he had never suspected 
had opened and he had found him- 
self in jail. 

Anyway, he thought it was a 
jail because he was locked in, and 
because the machine stayed with 
him as a warden. There was a 
whole world under the gay, gem- 
studded homes of the Venusians 
that appeared on the surface, so 
Jiminez discovered. The Justice 
Machine bore him through cor- 
ridors, past a dreadfully odorous 
place where filth-stained walls 
hinted at unpleasant events, into 
a narrow cell. There was a con- 
stant thrumming in the walls and 
floor. Machines were nearby, the 
machines, no doubt, on which the 
Venusians depended for all their 
goods. 

The Justice Machine set him 
down and retreated to a post by 
the door. 

J IMINEZ wiped his lips on the 
back of his hand, glowered at 
the silent machine and considered 
his position. 

He admitted to himself through 
a pounding headache that it was 
a rough spot. He had been in 



rougher, perhaps, but he couldn’t 
think when. 

There was a sound from the 
door and a clicking, rasping voice 
inquired: “O Monster?” 

It was the bug named— named 
—Jiminez managed to recall it: 
Popagator. 

“Hah!” cried Jiminez, at once 
again enraged. “You, Popagator! 
I thought you told me the Justice 
Machine wouldn’t bother me!” 

“An error, O Monster,” Popa- 
gator apologized. 

“Error, hah? You bet it was an 
error. Popagator, I’m telling you, 
you better get me out of here! 
You hear me? Don’t you know I 
got the whole United Nations be- 
hind me? You know what that 
means, don’t you? One bleat from 
me and, wham, zowie, the great 
white fathers from far off in space 
will come blazing and shooting 
down with their devil birds. Man, 
I’m warning you!” 

Popagator stepped nimbly out 
of range of the monster’s breath. 
He said ruefully: “The thing is, 
Monster, the deed is a terrible 
one. You killed one of our peo- 
ple-” 

“But he gimme a rough time!” 
“—while he was playing the 
whirlarang game. It is not the 
killing, Monster. It is interrupting 
the game. Wnotagashti the Drum 
may have been deranged, but he 
was entitled to throw his whirla- 
rang.” -

6(T T was a accident!” roared 
-*■ Jiminez. “Self-defense, see? 
I only touched the gaw-dam bug, 
that’s all. He split wide open. How 
was I supposed to know he was 
so—” 

“Peace, O Monster,” Popagator 
said with warm sympathy. “Now I 
understand your position. It was 
an accident?” 

“Gaw-dam right!” 

“Then,” said Popagator with 
great assurance, “you need not 
worry. The Justice Machine will 
shortly examine you, when wit- 
nesses are found.” 

“Witnesses? What kind of wit- 
nesses?” 

“Those who may know some- 
thing to your benefit, Monster. For 
be assured, all of our people love 
you monsters very much. We wish 
to help you.” 

“The best way to help me,” 
Jiminez snarled, “is to get me out 
of this stinking joint.” 

“Of course, Monster. It is only 
necessary to go through the for- 
mality before the Justice Ma- 
chine.” He shrugged— well, no. But 
he achieved the same effect. 

Jiminez took a deep breath and 
sat down, grumbling. The crime, 
he began to understand, was not 
so much murder, or insecticide, 
but interfering with someone play- 
ing a game. That was a definite 
breach of regulations. 

“But I didn’t know!” Jiminez 
cried hoarsely. “Our customs are 



all different, and besides he gave 
me a hard time.” 

“Of course, O Monster,” soothed 
Popagator. “I understand. Believe 
me, I shall see that the Justice 
Machine takes that into account 
at the hearing. And surely you 
will be released. Have no doubt 
of it.” 

“That’s better,” grunted Jimi r 
nez, slightly appeased. 

“Of course,” said the Venusian 
delicately, “if by any unforeseen 
chance—” 

“Hey, wait!” squawked Jiminez. 
“What chance?” 

“O Monster,” said Popagator 
gravely, “there is always the theo- 
retical and hardly to be considered 
possibility that the Justice Ma- 
chine will make a mistake.” 
“Now you tell me! Listen, bus- 
ter, I’m practically an ambassa- 
dor, get that through your thick 
head! If anything hap—” 

“But in that event,” the Venu- 
sian interrupted quickly, “there re- 
mains the Appeals Panel. You 
see? Our machines are arranged so 
that even the hardly possible 
chance of error can still be cor- 
rected.” 

“It damn better be,” said Jimi- 
nez in a surly tone. He slumped 
back against the wall. “Jeez,” he 
groaned, “what a head. Say, listen. 
It looks like I’m going to be here 
for a while. I want you to do 
something for me.” 

“Command me, O Monster.”

“You take a hike down by my 
ship, okay? There’s a rack of 
steel bottles marked ‘Emergency 
Water Supply.’ Some of them are 
sealed tight. Don’t pay any at- 
tention to those— they’ve got water 
in them— but bring me one of the 
others.” 

“Certainly, O Monster.” Popa- 
gator turned to go. 

He was halted by the Earth- 
man. “Wait a minute! Come to 
think of it, better bring me two!” 

nPHE trial didn’t take very long. 

-*■ The Justice Machine waved 
its ropy steel tentacles and cas- 
cades of flickering lights flashed 
up and down its sides as it 
weighed the evidence of the eight 
Venusians. Nobody asked Jimi- 
nez to testify, but that was just 
as well. He wasn’t paying much 
attention anyway. He caroled: 

“The wind blew through the 
old man’s whiskers. 

His heart was filled with joy 
and song.” 

The Justice Machine squatted 
on its metal wheels, its innards 
clicking. No sound came out of 
the Justice Machine— it only re- 
ceived information; it did not 
broadcast any. The Witnesses were 
brief and explicit. There was a 
lot of talk about the lifetime 
Total Aggregate Whirlarang 
Weighted Score of the deceased 



Wnotagashti the Drum. Jiminez 
couldn’t make much sense of it 
and didn’t much try. 

"He never had to wear pajamas—” 

The Justice Machine’s lights 
flickered incandescently and then, 
suddenly, all went out at once. 

Three of the Machine’s ten- 
tacles made a gesture toward Jimi- 
nez. The Venusians chattered ex- 
citedly among themselves. 

“Because his whiskers were so 
long!” 

Jiminez, heedless, sang drunken- 
ly on, waving the stainless steel 
flask of home-stilled popskull in 
time with the clicking of the ma- 
chine. At last he noticed that the 
small-bodied Venusian named 
Popagator was standing before 
him, humbly waiting his attention. 

“O Monster?” said Popagator. 

“Well, now what?” Jiminez de- 
manded belligerently, hiccoughing. 

“The trial is over, O Monster. 
The Justice Machine has reached 
its decision.” 

“It has, has it?” panted Jimi- 
nez, standing up with some diffi- 
culty. “Aha. Oho. And just a -bout 
bloody time, if you ask me. Well, 
I guess I’m about ready to shake 
the dust of this crummy planet off 
my feet anyhow. So long, bugs! So 
long, suckers! Here goes Jiminez 
for the Belgian Congo and a life-

time of luxury!” He laughed rau- 
cously, disregarding the fact that 
he could not take off for another 
three and a half weeks, and started 
for the door. 

But he didn’t make it The Jus- 
tice Machine flared in blinding 
colors and spun swiftly to come 
between him and the door. 

“Hey!” cried Jiminez, more sur- 
prised than angry. “What’s mat- 
ter?” 

Popagator came up behind him 
and coughed apologetically— well, 
no. What he did was to contract 
his dorsal chitin with a faint pop- 
ping sound, but it was the equiva- 
lent of a cough. 

He said regretfully: “O Mon- 
ster, don’t worry, but there has 
been some mistake. The Justice 
Machine found you guilty.” 

IV 

r I ''HE Slide spun around three 
times, and on the third turn 
released the hilt of his whirlarang 
with that slippy-slidy motion that 
was the hallmark of his entire 
family. The whirlarang shot out 
straight and true for the grove of 
tinkleberry trees that indicated the 
target area of the eighth square. It 
circled the grove twice, flipflopped, 
described a lazy S and returned 
to its owner. 

He caught it triumphantly. “A 
six-pointer!” he crowed. “Top that, 
Popagator!” 



“I don’t know if I can,” Popa- 
gator confessed moodily. ‘Tm off 
my form today.” 

“You certainly are,” jeered the 
larger Venusian. “It isn’t often I 
take three straight games from 
you. What’s bothering you? The 
Monster?” 

Popagator nodded— well, no. 
The Slide said sympathetically: 
“I know how you feel. It presses 
on your mind, thinking of him 
sitting in that cell and waiting for 
the Justice Machine to report on 
the decision of the Appeals Panel. 
I feel it myself.” 

“We’ve got to help him!” 

“Of course, Popagator. It’s cruel 
to worry another being— and Earth 
monsters are considered to be be- 
ings in spite of everything.” 

“I hate to think of him worry- 
ing, as he must be.” 

“Me, too.” 

Popagator said seriously: “I 

want to do something about it 
right away. I propose that we both 
visit him to cheer him up— the 
sooner, the better.” 

“Agreed!” cried The Slide. 
“Come, let’s hurry! We’ll finish this 
game and then— no more than two 
more, eh? And then we’ll race to 
his side!” 

13 UT it was a long time for 
Dave Jiminez. With a full 
flask by his side, he was cold 
sober. That had never happened 
before in his life. 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The Justice Machine was si- 
lent and motionless by the door; 
it never moved, never made a 
sound except once when, driven 
by desperation, he approached it. 
And then it was all sudden move- 
ment and threatening lashings of 
the arms, and he retreated and 
never approached it again. 

But now it moved. 

It rolled aside. The door opened 
and two Venusians clattered in— 
that Popagator and another one 
who had testified at the crazy 
mockery they called a trial. The 
Slide, his name was. 

“This is a friend, O Monster,” 
said Popagator. “He is on your 
side, just as I am. You mustn’t 
worry. We’ll see that you get out 
of here.” 

“Damn better,” snarled Jiminez. 
“What’s holding things up?” 

“The Appeals Panel,” said The 
Slide. “It is considering your case. 
Naturally, it will reverse the Jus- 
tice Machine’s decision.” 

“Naturally,” growled Jiminez. 
“How long does that take?” 

"DOTH Venusians hesitated and 
-■-* looked at each other. 

“It doesn’t take long, O Mon- 
ster,” said Popagator at last. 

“Better not.” Jiminez looked 
at his visitors and made a repelled 
face. Still, even cockroach-shaped 
visitors were better than no visi- 
tors at all. Anyway, he felt slight- 
ly better. He felt good enough, in 



fact, to bend down for the ignored 
stainless steel flask. He took a long 
pull, moaned as his throat con- 
stricted, stood rigid for a moment 
and then relaxed. 

“Zowie,” he said hoarsely. “Say, 
just out of curiosity— what would 
happen if the Appeals Panel ruled 
against me?” 

“Why,” said Popagator, “the 
penalty for interference with the 
game is death, of course.” 

“D— ” Jiminez paused, the flask 
half-tilted in his hand, his sallow 
face turning a dirty gray. “D— ” 
“Death,” the Venusian finished 
for him. But he added, in a warm- 
ly sympathetic tone: “There’s 

nothing to worry about, O Mon- 
ster. We are on your side. We’ll 
see that no harm comes to you.” 
“You will? How will you? What 
happens if you don’t?” 

“O Monster,” said Popagator 
apologetically, “then the Justice 
Machine will exterminate you. But 
don’t worry. It is nearly certain 
that the Appeals Panel will cor- 
rect the error.” 

Jiminez slowly set the flask 
down and began loosening his col- 
lar. 

He stared at the Justice Ma- 
chine. Like all the Venusian gadg- 
ets, it seemed to be built to last 
He could just imagine those ropy 
metal limbs wrapping around a 
Venusian and cracking the shell, 
wrenching the limbs off, ending 
life in a matter of seconds. With

a mammalian Earthman, all flesh 
and fat and fluids surrounding a 
frame of bone, it would be squish- 
ier. But no less final. 

He swallowed, and found his 
throat was dry. 

“That room—” He coughed. 
“That room I passed on the way 
in.” 

“The Room of Reckoning, O 
Monster?” 

“If that’s what you call the one 
that looks like a slaughterhouse, 
yeah. Is that the place where—” 

“That is the place, O Monster,” 
said Popagator gravely. 

T HERE was a clicking from the 
Justice Machine and lights 
flashed up and down its sides. 

Jiminez jumped, kicking the 
flask at his feet clattering against 
the wall. He hesitated, torn be- 
tween basic urges; he glanced fran- 
tically at the Justice Machine, 
then dropped to his knees, scrab- 
bling for the flask and stopper. 

He heard a sorrowful voice say: 
“Oh, my. This is very strange.” 
He looked up, apprehensive. 
Popagator and The Slide were 
clacking at each other in a low 
tone. 

“What happened?” Jiminez 
bleated in fright 

Popagator looked at the other 
Venusian, and then spoke. “The 
Appeals Panel, O Monster. It has 
acted in your case.” 

“And?” 



The Venusian’s embarrassment 
was almost human. “Don’t worry, 
O Monster. But they, too, found 
you guilty.” 

Jiminez fell back against the 
wall. 

Then he surged forward, furious. 
“Now wait!” he bawled. “I took 
enough from you guys! I demand 
you get me out of this place right 
now. This damn thing has gone 
far enough and it isn’t going any 
further, you hear? I’m warning 
you. Do you want the great white 
godlings from the sky coming 
down here shooting and stomping 
and—” 

“Oh, no, O Monster,” inter- 
rupted The Slide. “Of course not.” 

“Well, then! Then you damn 
better smarten up. I tell you there’s 
going to be one terrible mess here 
on Venus if I don’t get back. The 
I.G.Y. don’t like it when us emis- 
saries get knocked off, you know! 
And what the I.G.Y. says goes.” 

“That is true, O Monster,” The 
Slide admitted. “It is known to all 
of us. The I.G.Y. is in charge of 
Venus.” 

“So you better get me out of 
here!” 

The Venusians whispered fleet- 
ingly to one another. 

“Speak up!” Jiminez cried. 
“Talk English!” 

“We were only discussing how 
we could best help you,” apolo- 
gized Popagator. Then, in a voice 
as warm as toast, he added: “O 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




THE GENTLEST UNPEOPLE 



85 




Monster, there is a way. It is 
clear that our machines are not 
equipped to deal with Earth per- 
sons. We must act against the 
machines.” 

“Meaning what?” 

“Meaning, O Monster, that 
Venusians such as we cannot per- 
mit you to suffer unjustly. It is 
against our code of behavior.” 
Popagator looked gravely at Jimi- 
nez with all of his eyes and said: 
“We are going to help you escape!” 

J IMINEZ, alone in the cell, 
waited, drinking heavily. It was 
a searing torment to him, to think 
that he was trusting the word of 
the lousy bugs. Bugs were to be 
stepped on or sprayed with D.D.T. 
Bugs were to furnish him with the 
good things of life, such as jewels 
and gold, that would finance a hap- 
py and dissolute old age back on 
Earth. Bugs were not to be trusted. 
But he had no choice. 

And then, at last, there was a 
scratching at the door. 

It was Popagator, The Slide and 
four other Venusians. 

Jiminez froze, watching. Two of 
the Venusians stepped up to the 
quietly menacing Justice Machine 
and did something he couldn’t fol- 
low to the arrays of lights and 
glittering projections on its sides. 

There was a series of clicks and 
a flash of muted lights. And then 
the Justice Machine rolled quiet- 
ly out into the corridor and away. 



“We relieved it of duty, O Mon- 
ster,” said Popagator proudly. “It 
is a thing which is seldom done.” 
“Is it a thing that’ll get me out 
of here?” Jiminez demanded. 

“Oh, beyond doubt Monster,” 
Popagator added politely, “permit 
me to introduce you to our col- 
leagues in this venture of rescuing 
you. Reading from left to right 
these are Xxil the Predestinarian, 
Klamagog, Small Wnotagashti and 
Sustemong. The Slide you already 
know.” 

“Pleased to meet you,” Jiminez 
said absently. “Now let’s get the— 
Hey. Small who?” 

“Small Wnotagashti, O Mon- 
ster.” 

“Any relation to—” 

“Oh, yes. His son, O Monster.” 
Jiminez swallowed. “You mean 
this character’s the son of the bug 
I knocked off and he’s still willing 
to help me get out of this place?” 
“We Venusians are extremely 
helpful and polite,” Popagator ex- 
plained. “Now we must go. We 
have to walk down this corridor, 
past the machine areas, into the 
Room of Reckoning. There—” 

“Oh, no, you don’t!” Jiminez 
cried. “I’m not going in that place! 
What is this, a doublecross?” 

“It is necessary, O Monster,” 
Popagator said patiently. “There 
is a chute in the Room of Reckon- 
ing which is used for removing 
the—” he hesitated— “which leads 
to a way out” 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“There isn’t any other way, O 
Monster.” 

Jiminez, carrying the last few 
drops of precious numbwit in the 
stainless steel flask, shambled after 
the little posse of Venusians. They 
went down the long corridor past 
the shuddering chambers of the 
machines, and no one was to be 
seen. 

“We are here, O Monster,” said 
one of them. 

“Where?” asked Jiminez suspi- 
ciously. 

“The Room of Reckoning, the 
avenue of your escape,” Popagator 
said in a voice as sweet as honey 
and as warm as toast. “Open that 
door, O Monster, and walk in.” 

Jiminez, his hand on the door, 
turned, suddenly afraid, but they 
were crowding in on him, all six 
of them. The door was borne open 
and he was thrust inside. 

And there was the Justice Ma- 
chine, its ropy arms a-swing, in 
the room with the moldering spat- 
ters of green and blue, that now 
added a new range of colors to 
its scheme. 

O UTSIDE, in the soggy even- 
ing air, the Venusians con- 
gratulated each other on the tact 
and delicacy with which they had 
handled the matter. 

“It would have been cruel to 
let him suffer,” said Small Wnota- 
gashti solemnly. “My father would 
have wanted it this way.” 



“We have done well,” agreed 
Popagator, and the others went 
about their errands, leaving him 
with The Slide. 

The Slide stretched and yawned 
—well, no. But he relaxed. “We 
Venusians,” he commented, “are 
polite and thoughtful to a fault. 
Tell me, do you think we can get 
another game in before dark?” 
“If not,” twinkled Popagator, 
“we can always play under the 
lights. I don’t have any trouble 
with nighttime rules!” 

The Slide excused himself: 
“This has been a strain, you know.” 
“Of course. It is well known 
that monsters require even more 
politeness and patience than our 
own race. It is the least we can 
do for them.” They started off 
toward the first square. After a 
moment, Popagator added absent- 
ly: “You know, in one way we 
have failed the monsters even yet.” 
“Failed them? What are you 
talking about, Popagator?” 

“The ship,” Popagator ex- 
plained. “They expect it to be re- 
turned. Perhaps we should return 
it as a matter of common polite- 
ness, with a few of us aboard?” 

He hefted his whirlarang and 
tossed it in a slow curve, following 
it with his eye. 

“I am sure,” he said thought- 
fully, “that there would be many 
acts of politeness we could per- 
form on their own planet”

Making the ultimate anything 
takes the ultimate thought — 
and how ultimate is ultimate? 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 

D ID a twig snap? Dixon 
looked back and thought 
he saw a dark shape melt 
into the underbrush. Instantly he 
froze, staring back through the 
green-boled trees. There was a 
complete and expectant silence. 
Far overhead, a carrion bird bal- 
anced on an updraft, surveying the 
sunburned landscape, waiting, hop- 
ing. 



Then Dixon heard a low, im- 
patient cough from the under- 
brush. 

Now he knew he was being fol- 
lowed. Before, it had only been an 
assumption. But those vague, half- 
seen shapes had been real. They 
had left him alone on his trek to 
the signal station, watching, de- 
ciding. Now they were ready to 
try something. 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He removed the Weapon from 
its holster, checked the safeties, 
reholstered it and continued walk- 
ing. 

He heard another cough. Some- 
thing was patiently trailing him, 
probably waiting until he left the 
bush and entered the forest Dixon 
grinned to himself. 

Nothing could hurt him. He had 
the Weapon. 

Without it, he would never have 
ventured so far from his space- 
ship. One simply didn’t wander 
around on an alien planet. But 
Dixon could. On his hip was the 
weapon to end all weapons, abso- 
lute insurance against anything 
that walked or crawled or flew 
or swam. 

It was the last word in hand- 
guns, the ultimate in personal 
armament 

It was the Weapon. 

He looked back again. There 
were three beasts, less than fifty 
yards behind him. From that dis- 
tance, they resembled dogs or 
hyenas. They coughed at him and 
moved slowly forward. 

He touched the Weapon, but de- 
cided against using it immediate- 
ly. There would be plenty of time 
when they came closer. 

A LFRED Dixon was a short 
man, very broad in the chest 
and shoulders. His hair was streaky 
blond, and he had a blond mus- 
tache which curled up at the ends. 



This mustache gave his tanned 
face a frank, ferocious appearance. 

His natural habitat was Ter- 
ra’s bars and taverns. There, 
dressed in stained khakis, he could 
order drinks in a loud, belligerent 
voice, and pierce his fellow-drink- 
ers with narrow gunmetal-blue 
eyes. He enjoyed explaining to the 
drinkers, in a somewhat contemp- 
tuous tone, the difference between 
a Sykes needier and a Colt three- 
point, between the Martian horned 
adleper and the Venusian scorn, 
and just what to do when a Rann- 
arean horntank is charging you in 
thick brush, and how to beat off an 
attack of winged glitterflits. 

Some men considered Dixon all 
bluff, but they were careful not 
to call it. Others thought he was a 
good man in spite of his inflated 
opinion of himself. He was just 
overconfident, they explained. 
Death or mutilation would cor- 
rect this flaw. 

Dixon was a great believer in 
personal armament. To his way of 
thinking, the winning of the Amer- 
ican West was simply a contest be- 
tween bow and arrow and Colt 
.44. Africa? The spear against the 
rifle. Mars? The Colt three-point 
against the spinknife. H-bombs 
smeared cities, but individual men 
with small arms took the terri- 
tory. Why look for fuzzy eco- 
nomic, philosophical or political 
reasons when everything was so 
simple? 



THE GUN WITHOUT A BANG 



89 



He had, of course, utter confi- 
dence in the Weapon. 

Glancing back, he saw that half 
a dozen doglike creatures had 
joined the original three. They 
were walking in the open now, 
tongues lolling out, slowly closing 
the distance. 

Dixon decided to hold fire just 
a little longer. The shock effect 
would be that much greater. 

He had held many jobs in his 
time — explorer, hunter, prospec- 
tor, asteroider. Fortune seemed to 
elude him. The other man always 
stumbled across the lost city, shot 
the rare beast, found the ore-bear- 
ing stream. He accepted his fate 
cheerfully. Damned poor luck, but 
what can you do? Now he was 
a radioman, checking the auto- 
matic signal stations on a dozen 
unoccupied worlds. 

But more important, he was giv- 
ing the ultimate handgun its first 
test in the field. The gun’s inven- 
tors hoped the Weapon would be- 
come standard. Dixon hoped he 
would become standard with it 

TIE had reached the edge of the 
rain forest. His ship lay about 
two miles ahead in a little clear- 
ing. As he entered the forest’s 
gloomy shade, he heard the excited 
squeaking of arboreals. They were 
colored orange and blue, and they 
watched him intently from the tree- 
tops. 

It was definitely an African sort 



of place, Dixon decided. He hoped 
he would encounter some big 
game, get a decent trophy head or 
two. Behind him, the wild dogs 
had approached to twenty yards. 
They were gray and brown, the 
size of terriers, with a hyena’s jaws. 
Some of them had moved into the 
underbrush, racing ahead to cut 
him off. 

It was time to show the Weapon. 

Dixon unholstered it. The Weap- 
on was pistol-shaped and quite 
heavy. It also balanced poorly. The 
inventors had promised to reduce 
the weight and improve the heft 
in subsequent models. But Dixon 
liked it just the way it was. He 
admired it for a moment, then 
clicked off the safeties and ad- 
justed for single shot. 

The pack came loping toward 
him, coughing and snarling. Dixon 
took casual aim and fired. 

The Weapon hummed faintly. 
Ahead, for a distance of a hun- 
dred yards, a section of forest 
simply vanished. 

Dixon had fired the first disin- 
tegrator. 

From a muzzle aperture of less 
than an inch, the beam had fanned 
out to a maximum diameter of 
twelve feet. A conic section, waist- 
high and a hundred yards long, ap- 
peared in the forest. Within it, 
nothing remained. Trees, insects, 
plants, shrubs, wild dogs, butter- 
flies, all were gone. Overhanging 
boughs caught in the blast area 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



looked as though they had been 
sheared by a giant razor. 

Dixon estimated he had caught 
at least seven of the wild dogs 
in the blast Seven beasts with a 
half-second burst! No problems of 
deflection or trajectory, as with a 
missile gun. No need to reload, 
for the Weapon had a power span 
of eighteen duty-hours. 

The perfect weapon! 

He turned and walked on, re- 
holstering the heavy gun. 

There was silence. The forest 
creatures were considering the new 
experience. In a few moments, they 
recovered from their surprise. Blue 
and orange arboreals swung 
through the trees above him. Over- 
head, the carrion bird soared low, 
and other black-winged birds came 
out of the distant sky to join it 
And the wild dogs coughed in the 
underbrush. 

They hadn’t given up yet. Dixon 
could hear them in the deep foliage 
on either side of him, moving 
rapidly, staying out of sight. 

He drew the Weapon, wonder- 
ing if they would dare try again. 
They dared. 

A SPOTTED gray hound burst 
from a shrub just behind him. 
The gun hummed. The dog van- 
ished in mid-leap, and the trees 
shivered slightly as air clapped 
into the sudden vacuum. 

Another dog charged and Dixon 
disintegrated it frowning slightly. 



These beasts couldn’t be consid- 
ered stupid. Why didn’t they learn 
the obvious lesson — that it was 
impossible to come against him 
and his Weapon? Creatures all 
over the Galaxy had quickly 
learned to be wary of an armed 
man. Why not these? 

Without warning, three dogs 
leaped from different directions. 
Dixon clicked to automatic and 
mowed -them down like a man 
swinging a scythe. Dust whirled 
and sparkled, filling the vacuum. 

He listened intently. The forest 
seemed filled with low coughing 
sounds. Other packs were coming 
to join in the kill. 

Why didn’t they learn? 

It suddenly burst upon him. 
They didrtt learn, he thought, be- 
cause the lesson was too subtle! 

The Weapon — disintegrating si- 
lently, quickly, cleanly. Most of 
the dogs he hit simply vanished. 
There were no yelps of agony, no 
roars or howls or screams. 

And above all, there was no loud 
boom to startle them, no smell of 
cordite, no click of a new shell 
levered in . 

Dixon thought. Maybe they 
aren’t smart enough to know this 
is a killing weapon. Maybe they 
haven’t figured out whafs going 
on. Maybe they think Tm defense- 
less. 

He walked more rapidly through 
the dim forest He was in no dan- 
ger, he reminded himself. Just be-

cause they couldn’t realize it was 
a killing weapon didn’t alter the 
fact that it was. Still, he would in- 
sist on a noise-maker in the new 
models. It shouldn’t be difficult. 
And the sound would be reassur- 
ing. 

The arboreals were gaining con- 
fidence now, swinging down almost 
to the level of his head, their fangs 
bared. Probably carnivorous, Dixon 
decided. With the Weapon on au- 
tomatic, he slashed great cuts in 
the treetops. 

The arboreals fled, screaming 
at him. Leaves and small branches 
rained down. Even the dogs were 
momentarily cowed, edging away 
from the falling debris. 

Dixon grinned to himself — just 
before he was flattened. A big 
bough, severed from its tree, had 
caught him across the left shoul- 
der as it fell. 

The Weapon was knocked from 
his hand. It landed ten feet away, 
still on automatic, disintegrating 
shrubs a few yards from him. 

He dragged himself from under 
the bough and dived for the Weap- 
on. An arboreal got to it first. 

T\IXON threw himself face- 
” down on the ground. The ar- 
boreal, screaming in triumph, 
whirled the disintegrator around its 
head. Giant trees, cut through, went 
crashing to the forest floor. The air 
was dark with falling twigs and 
leaves, and the ground was cut 



into trenches. A sweep of the disin- 
tegrator knifed through the tree 
next to Dixon, and chopped the 
ground a few inches from his feet 
He jumped away, and the next 
sweep narrowly missed his head. 

He had given up hope. But then 
the arboreal became curious. Chat- 
tering gaily, it turned the Weapon 
around and tried to look into the 
muzzle. 

The animal’s head vanished — 
silently. 

Dixon saw his chance. He ran 
forward, leaping a trench, and re- 
covering the disintegrator before 
another arboreal could play with 
it He turned it off automatic. 

Several dogs had returned. They 
were watching him closely. 

Dixon didn’t dare fire yet His 
hands were shaking so badly, there 
was more risk to himself than to 
the dogs. He turned and stumbled 
in the direction of the ship. 

The dogs followed. 

Dixon quickly recovered his 
nerve. He looked at the glittering 
Weapon in his hand. He had con- 
siderably more respect for it now, 
and more than a little fear. Much 
more fear than the dogs had. Ap- 
parently they didn’t associate the 
forest damage with the disinte- 
grator. It must have seemed like 
a sudden, violent storm to them. 

But the storm was over. It was 
hunting time again. 

He was in thick brush now, fir- 
ing ahead to clear a path. The 



THE GUN WITHOUT A BANG 



93 



dogs were on either side, keeping 
pace. He fired continually into the 
foliage, occasionally getting a dog. 
There were several dozen of them, 
pressing him closely. 

Damn it, Dixon thought, aren’t 
they counting their losses? 

Then he realized they probably 
didn’t know how to count 

He struggled on, not far from 
the spaceship. A heavy log lay in 
his path. He stepped over it. 

The log came angrily to life and 
opened enormous jaws directly un- 
der his legs. 

TIE fired blindly, holding the 
trigger down for three sec- 
onds and narrowly missing his own 
feet. The creature vanished. Dixon 
gulped, swayed, and slid feet-first 
into the pit he had just dug. 

He landed heavily, wrenching 
his left ankle. The dogs ringed 
the prt, snapping and snarling at 
him. 

Steady, Dixon told himself. He 
cleared the beasts from the pit’s 
rim with two bursts, and tried to 
climb out. 

The sides of the pit were too 
steep and had been fused into 
glass. 

Frantically he tried again and 
again, recklessly expending his 
strength. Then he stopped and 
forced himself to think. The 
Weapon had got him into this 
hole; the Weapon could get him 
out. 



This time he cut a shallow ramp 
out of the pit, and limped pain- 
fully out. 

His left ankle could hardly bear 
weight. Even worse was the pain 
in his shoulder. That bough must 
have broken it, he decided. Using 
a branch as a crutch, Dixon limped 
on. 

Several times the dogs attacked. 
He disintegrated them, and the gun 
grew increasingly heavy in his 
right hand. The carrion birds came 
down to pick at the neatly slashed 
carcases. Dixon felt darkness 
crawl around the edges of his 
vision. He fought it back. He must 
not faint now, while the dogs were 
around him. 

The ship was in sight. He broke 
into a clumsy run, and fell im- 
mediately. Some of the dogs were 
on him. 

He fired, cutting them in two 
and removing half an inch from 
his right boot, almost down to the 
toe. He struggled to his feet and 
went on. 

Quite a weapon, he thought 
Dangerous to anyone, including 
the wielder. He wished he had the 
inventor in his sights. 

Imagine inventing a gun with- 
out a bang! 

He reached the ship. The dogs 
ringed him as he fumbled with 
the airlock. Dixon disintegrated the 
closest two, and stumbled inside. 
Darkness was crawling around his 
vision again and he could feel

nausea rising thickly in his throat. 

With his last strength, he swung 
the airlock shut and sat down. 
Safe at last! 

Then he heard the low cough. 

He had shut one of the dogs 
inside with him. 

His arm felt too weak to lift 
the heavy Weapon, but slowly he 
swung it up. The dog, barely visible 
in the dimly lighted ship, leaped at 
him. 

For a terrifying instant, Dixon 
thought he couldn’t squeeze the 
trigger. The dog was at his throat. 
Reflex must have clenched his 
hand. 

The dog yelped once and was 
silent 

Dixon blacked out. 

HEN he recovered conscious- 
ness, he lay for a long time, 
just savoring the glorious sensa- 
tion of being alive. He was going 
to rest for a few minutes. Then he 
was getting out of here, away from 
alien planets, back to a Terran 
bar. He was going to get roaring 
drunk. Then he was going to find 
that inventor and ram the Weap- 
on down the man’s throat, cross- 
ways. 

Only a homicidal maniac would 
invent a gun without a bang. 

But that would come later. 
Right now it was a pleasure just 
to be alive, to lie in the sunlight, 
enjoying the . 

Sunlight? Inside a spaceship? 



He sat up. At his feet lay the 
tail and one leg of the dog. Be- 
yond it there was an interesting 
zigzag slashed through the side of 
the spaceship. It was about three 
inches wide and four feet long. 
Sunlight filtered through it. 

Outside, four dogs were sitting 
on their haunches, peering in. 

He had cut through his space- 
ship while killing the last dog. 

Then he saw other slashes in 
the ship. Where had they come 
from? 

Oh, yes, when he was fighting his 
way back to the ship. That last 
hundred yards. A few shots must 
have touched the spaceship. 

He stood up and examined the 
cuts. A neat job, he thought, with 
the calm that sometimes accom- 
panies hysteria. Yes, sir, very neat 
indeed. 

Here were the severed control 
cables. That was where the radio 
had been. Over there he had man- 
aged to nick the oxygen and water 
tanks in a single burst, which was 
good shooting by anybody’s stand- 
ards. And here — yes, he’d done it, 
all right A really clever hook shot 
had cut the fuel lines. And the fuel 
had all run out in obedience to the 
law of gravity and formed a pool 
around the ship and sunk into the 
ground. 

Not bad for a guy who wasn’t 
even trying, Dixon thought crazily. 
Couldn’t have done better with a 
blowtorch. 




THE GUN WITHOUT A BANG 



95 



As a matter of fact, he couldn’t 
have done it with a blowtorch. 
Spaceship hulls were too tough. 
But not too tough for the good old 
little old sure-fire never-miss 
Weapon . 

A YEAR later, when Dixon 
still hadn’t repotted, a ship 
was sent out. They were to give 
him decent burial, if any remains 
could be found, and bring back 
the prototype disintegrator, if that 
could be found. 

The recovery ship touched down 
near Dixon’s ship, and the crew 
examined the slashed and gutted 
hull with interest. 

“Some guys,” said the engineer, 
“don’t know how to handle a gun.” 
“I’ll say,” said the chief pilot. 
They heard a banging noise 
from the direction of the rain 
forest. They hurried over and 
found that Dixon was not dead. 
He was very much alive, and sing- 
ing as he worked. 

He had constructed a wooden 
shack and planted a vegetable 
garden around it Surrounding the 
garden was a palisade. Dixon was 



hammering in a new sapling to re- 
place a rotten one when the men 
came up. 

Quite predictably, one of the 
men cried, “You’re alive!” 

“Damned right,” Dixon said. 
“Touch and go for a while before 
I got the palisade built. Nasty 
brutes, those dogs. But I taught 
them a little respect.” 

Dixon grinned and touched a 
bow that leaned against the pali- 
sade within easy reach. It had been 
cut from a piece of seasoned, 
springy wood, and beside it was a 
quiver-full of arrows. 

“They learned respect,” Dixon 
said, “after they saw a few of their 
pals running around with a shaft 
thtough their flanks.” 

“But the Weapon—” the chief 
pilot asked. 

“Ah, the Weapon!” exclaimed 
Dixon, with a mad, merry light in 
his eyes. “Couldn’t have survived 
without it” 

He turned back to his work. He 
was hammering the sapling into 
place with the heavy, flat butt of 
the Weapon.

EARTH IS ROOM ENOUGH 
by Isaac Asimov. Doubleday & 
Co., Inc., N.Y., $2.95 

A SIMOV doesn’t have to leave 
our atmosphere at all in this 
collection, as you can gather from 
the title, in order to give his reader 
an enjoyable yam. There are 
seventeen items, including some 
gag poems and short-shorts. The 
longest work is “The Dead Past,” 
an ingenious rework of the antique 
theme of the time reviewing 
gadget. “Satisfaction Guaranteed,” 
a U.S. Robot story, gives the 
reader pause. A suave, handsome, 



worldly robot? Heaven forbid! 
And “Kid Stuff’ underscores the 
problems of elves in our crass, 
materialistic world. 

Asimov mishmashes broad hu- 
mor, pure fantasy, sensitive social 
studies in this volume, but finds 
room enough to suit most tastes.

main of the so-called Egghead and 
carries the impressive title of Cos- 
mology. 

Munitz has collected the writ- 
ings of an impressive group of 
savants from Plato and Aristotle 
to the moderns, Einsteins and Ed- 
dington, and to the ultra-moderns, 
Bondi and Hoyle. The ancient 
concepts of the Universe seem 
quaint today, but could we have 
done better with limited observa- 
tional equipment and figuratively 
on our knees instead of standing 
on the shoulders of giants? 

DOOMSDAY MORNING by 
C. L. Moore. Doubleday & Co, 
Inc, N. Y., $2.95. 

COMETIMES it just doesn’t 
^ pay to be C. L. Moore. For 
almost anyone else, this rating 
would be “Excellent” For Mrs. 
Kuttner, however, it’s something 
less than that 

Like Heinlein in Double Star, 
Miss Moore has chosen an actor 
to be principal protagonist. A has- 
been while still young, he has 
been shattered in spirit and career 
by the shock of his wife’s deser- 
tion and violent death. He has 
sunk to the level of Cropper, itin- 
erant laborer. Unexpectedly, he is 
summoned by the Secretary of 
COMUS (Communications, U.S.) 
which, under President Raleigh, 
rules America and has become a 
benevolent dictatorship. 



The Secretary informs Rohan, 
the actor, that he is to take over 
direction of a traveling troupe in 
California, a rebellious state from 
which COMUS has been forced to 
withdraw control. The Califor- 
nians reportedly have something 
called Anti-Corn, a weapon capable 
of destroying COMUS. Rohan’s 
role in the counter-insurrection 
doesn’t make sense, even to him- 
self. Evidently his troupe is gim- 
micked for COMUS, but in no 
way he can figure. In addition, he 
has been hypnotized by an un- 
known party, and post-hypnotic 
compulsions add to his confusion. 
In further addition, his mental and 
physical processes are on the bru- 
tal side, unlike Heinlein’s sensi- 
tive ham. 

As I said — under another au- 
thor’s byline, the yam would have 
rung gongs, but the incomparable 
Moore could have done better.

the layman. No small credit in this 
respect is due the translator, J. B. 
Sidgwick. 

THROUGH A GLASS DARK- 
LY by Kathleen Norris. Double- 
day & Co., Inc., N. Y, $3.75 

H ITHERTO a stranger to these 
pages, the reknowned K. 
Norris has penned a disturbing 
fantasy. Her book is in two parts; 
the first takes place in Foxcross- 
ing, a town in the United States 
of another plane of existence. Al- 
though not a Utopia, it is consid- 
erably nearer being one than ours. 
Death liberates a haphazard por- 
tion of us into that plane. Hunger 
and war have been abolished. A 
land-rent law insures that all peo- 
ple have the right to use the land, 
which remains government proper- 
ty. 

War is averted by a form of 
appeasement or a turning of cheek. 
Physical science is at approximate- 
ly our stage of development. 

Miss Norris nowhere makes any 
attempt at rationale; it is merely 
understood that they are a bit 
higher in the scale of goodness. But 
in spite of their wonderful world, 
they remain human and tragedies 
can likewise mar their lives. Cross- 
ers-over arrive the same age as at 
their death, and local inhabitants 
somehow know of their coming. 



Dr. Gil Saunders bewilderedly 
crosses over and is taken in tow 
by his new immediate superior at 
the atomic plant hospital, Dr. 
Trevelyan, and his exceptional 
wife and family. Miss Norris 
weaves a dreamlike spell in the 
first half of her book that is 
downright hypnotic. However, in 
the after half, the account of the 
reverse reincarnation in our plane 
of Saunders’ fiancee, Cherry 
Trevelyan, degenerates into a 
meaningless puddle of tears. That 
first half, though, is truly memo- 
rable. 

INTRODUCING ASTRONOMY 
by J. B. Sidgwick. The Macmillan 
Co., N. Y., $3.50 

S IDGWICK must have found 
Introducing Astronomy a snap 
after the job of translation he had 
to do on The Sun by Abetti. In 
any case, this was a book that he 
had written during the war to help 
air raid wardens and observers 
pass dreary hours. It was a popular 
success then and should prove so 
again, particularly since the au- 
thor has added new material and 
widened its scope. 

It contains much information 
concerning the Solar System, Luna 
and the Constellations, to which 
alone half the book is devoted. A 
natural for beginners.

Jeffery Lloyd Castle. Dodd, Mead 
& Co., N. Y., $3.00 

TT isn’t my function to say how 
a book should have been writ- 
ten. There is nothing amiss, though, 
in saying that the manuscript 
would not have suffered if Castle 
had been forced to do a drastic 
revision. His premise is that an- 
cient Egypt achieved space flight' 
and colonized Venus. Since then, 
they have secretly revisited Earth 
periodically to keep abreast of 
progress. Our first Venus flight is 
being organized and the objective 
of a striking couple from an Egyp- 
to-Venusian flying saucer is to at- 
tempt to prevent its takeoff. Unfor- 
tunately for the story, they are re- 
markably inept and ill-informed. 

There is a profusion of good 
characterization and background 
detail, but motivations and plot 
development take place literally 
and literately in a vacuum. Castle 
has accomplished the difficult feat 
of writing an unconvincingly con- 
vincing yam. 



CONSTRUCTING AN ASTRO- 
NOMICAL TELESCOPE by G. 
Matthewson. Philosophical Li- 
brary, N. Y., $3.00 

t 1 XACTLY one year ago, I re- 
viewed How to Make and 
Use a Telescope by Wilkins and 
Moore. I repeat the same cau- 
tion as then — if you are not 
equipped materially and psycho- 
logically for precision work, you 
had better forget about undertak- 
ing the project. Lens grinding in- 
volves exactitude and patience, so 
much so, in fact, that neglected 
wives are referred to as “glass 
widows.” It is immensely reward- 
ing, however, and, as Matthewson 
asserts, makes a wonderful hobby 
for the meticulous. But so does ob- 
servation, and sufficient energy 
should be reserved for the enjoy- 
ment of the fruits of toil. 

I’m afraid I cannot offer a 
choice between the two books. 
They both cover the ground like 
a tight lawn.

A S one god to another — 
/% let’s go home,” Jack 
_Z. A. Bates said. 

Bill Famum raised a space- 
gloved hand in negligent acknowl- 
edgment to a hastily kneeling 
native, and shook his head at Bates. 
“Let’s try Deneb — it’s almost in 
line on the way back — and then 
we can call it quits.” 

“But I want to get back and 



start making some profit out of 
this. The Galaxy is full of Homo 
sapiens. We’ve hit the jackpot first 
trip out. Let’s hurry on home and 
cash in.” 

“We need more information. 
This is too much of a good thing 
—it doesn’t make sense. I know 
there isn’t much chance of finding 
anything out by stopping at one 
more solar system. But it won’t

delay us more than a few weeks, 
and it won’t hurt to try.” 

“Yeah,” said Bates. “But what’s 
in it for us? And what if we find 
an inhabited planet? You know 
the chances are about two to one 
that we will. That’ll make thirteen 
we’ve found on this trip. Why 
risk bad luck?” 

“You’re no more superstitious 
than I am,” said Farnum. “You 
just want to get back Earthside. 
I’ll tell you what. We’ll toss a coin 
for it” 

Bates gestured futilely toward 
his coverall pocket, and then 
remembered he was wearing a 
spacesuit as a precaution against 
possible contamination from the 
natives. 

“And we’ll use one of my coins 
this time,” said Farnum, noticing 
the automatic motion. “I want to 
have a chance.” 

The coin dropped in Farnum’s 
favor, and their two-man scout 
ship hurled itself into space. 

'C' ARNUM operated the com- 
pact computer, aligning the 
ship’s velocity vector precisely 
while the stars could still be seen. 
Bates controlled the engines, meter- 
ing their ravenous demand for 
power just this side of destructive 
detonation, while the ship sucked 
energy from space — from the ad- 
jacent universe on the other side 
of Limbo. Finally the computer 
chimed, relays snicked, and the 



ship slid into the emptiness of 
Limbo as the stars winked out. 

With two trained men working 
as a team with the computer and 
the elaborate engine room con- 
trols, and with a certain amount of 
luck, the ship would drop back into 
normal space a couple of weeks 
later, close beside their target. 

“Well, that’s that,” said Far- 
num, relaxing and wiping the per- 
spiration off his forehead. “We’re 
back once again in the nothingness 
of nowhere. As I recall, it’s your 
week for K.P. Where’s the coffee?” 
“Coming right up,” said Bates. 
“But you won’t like it. It’s the last 
of the ‘God-food’ the Korite priests 
made for us.” 

Farnum shuddered. “Pour it out 
and make some fresh. With a skil- 
let, you stink, but you’re a thou- 
sand times better than Korites.” 
“Thanks,” Bates said, getting 
busy. “It was the third place we 
stopped that they were such good 
cooks, wasn’t it?” 

“Nope. Our third stop was the 
Porandians. They tried to kill us 
— called us ‘Devil spawn from the 
stars.’ You’re thinking of the fourth 
stop; the Balanites.” 

Bates shrugged. “It’s kind of 
hard to keep them all straight. 
Either they fall on their knees and 
worship us, or they try to kill us 
without even asking questions. 
Maybe it’s lucky they’re all so 
primitive.” 

“It may be lucky, but it doesn’t

add up. More than half the stars 
we visit have planets that can sup- 
port human life. And every one 
that can does. Once there must 
have been an interstellar empire. 
So why are all their civilizations so 
backward? They aren’t primitive— 
they’re decadent. And why do they 
all have such strong feelings— one 
way or the exact opposite — about 
people from the stars?” 

“Isn’t that why you want to try 
one more system?” asked Bates. 
“To give us another chance to get 
some answers? Here’s your coffee. 
Try to drink it quietly. I’m going 
to get some shuteye.” 

* | ’HE trip through the Limbo 
between adjacent universes 
passed uneventfully, as always. 
The computer chimed again on 
schedule, and a quick check by 
Farnum showed the blazing sun 
that suddenly appeared was Deneb, 
as advertised. Seventeen planets 
could be counted, and the fifth 
seemed to be Earth type. They 
approached it with the easy skill 
of long practice and swung into 
orbit about it. 

“This is what we’ve been look- 
ing for!” exclaimed Farnum, exam- 
ining the planet through a tele- 
scope. “They’ve got big cities and 
dams and bridges — they’re civi- 
lized. Let’s put the ship down.” 

“Wait up,” said Bates. “What if 
they’ve got starman-phobia? Re- 
member, they’re people, just like 



us; and with people, civilization 
and weapons go together.” 

“I think you’ve got it backwards. 
If they hate us, we can probably 
get away before they bring up 
their big artillery. But what if they 
love us? They might want to keep 
us beside them forever.” 

Bates nodded. “I’m glad you 
agree with me. Let’s get out of 
here. Nobody but us knows of the 
beautiful, profitable planets we’ve 
found, all ready to become part of 
a Terr an Empire. And if we don’t 
get back safe and sound, nobody 
will know. The information we’ve 
got is worth a fortune to us, and 
I want to be alive to collect it.” 
“Sure. But we’ve got the job 
of trying to find out why all those 
planets reverted to barbarism. This 
one hasn’t; maybe the answer’s 
here. There’s no use setting up an 
empire if it won’t last.” 

“It’ll last long enough to keep 
you and me on top of the heap.” 
“That’s not good enough. I want 
my kids— when I have them — to 
have their chances at the top of 
the heap too.” 

“Oh, all right. We’ll flip a coin, 
then.” 

‘We already did. You may be 
a sharp dealer, but you’d never 
welch on a bet. We’re going down.” 
Bates shrugged. “You win. Let’s 
put her down beside that big city 
over there — the biggest one, by 
the seashore.” 

As they approached the city,

they noticed at its outskirts a large 
flat plain, dotted with gantries. 
“Like a spaceport,” suggested Bill. 
“That’s our target” 

They landed neatly on the tar- 
mac and then sat there quietly, 
waiting to see what would happen. 

\ CROWD began to form. The 
two men sat tensely at their 
controls, but the throng clustering 
about the base of the ship showed 
no hostility. They also showed no 
reverence but, rather, a carefree 
interest and joyful welcome. 

“Well,” said Farnum at last, 
“looks like we might as well go 
outside and ask them to take us 
to their leader.” 

“I’m with you as usual,” said 
Bates, starting to climb into his 
spacesuit. “Weapons?” 

“I don’t think so. We can’t stop 
them if they get mad at us, and 
they look friendly enough. We’ll 
start off with the ‘let’s be pals’ 
routine.” 

Bates nodded. “After we learn 
the language. I always hate this 
part— it moves so slowly. You’d 
think there’d be some similarity 
among the tongues on different 
planets, wouldn’t you? But each 
one’s entirely different. I guess 
they’ve all been isolated too long.” 
The two men stepped out on the 
smooth plain, to be instantly sur- 
rounded by a laughing, chattering 
crowd. Farnum stared around in 
bewilderment at the variety of 



dress the crowd displayed. There 
were men and women in togas, in 
tunics, in draped dresses and kilts, 
in trousers and coats. Others con- 
sidered a light cloak thrown over 
the shoulders to be adequate. 
There was no uniformity of style 
or custom. 

“You pick me a boss-man out of 
this bunch,” he muttered to Bates. 

Finally a couple of young men, 
glowing with health and energy, 
came bustling through the crowd 
with an oblong box which they set 
down in front of the Earthmen. 
They pointed to the box and then 
back at Farnum and Bates, laugh- 
ing and talking as they did so. 

“What do you suppose they 
want us to do?” Farnum asked. 

One of the young men clapped 
his hands happily and reached 
down to touch the box. “What do 
you suppose they want us to do?” 
asked the box distinctly. 

“Oh. A recording machine. Prob- 
ably to help with language les- 
sons. Might as well help them out.” 

T^ARNUM and Bates took turns 
talking at the box for half an 
hour. Then the young man nodded, 
laughed, clapped his hands again, 
and the two men carried it away. 
The crowd went with them, wav- 
ing merrily as they departed. 

Bates shrugged his shoulders 
and went back into the ship, with 
Farnum close behind. 

A few hours after sunrise the

following morning, the crowd re- 
turned, as gay and carefree as be- 
fore, led by the two young men 
who had carried the box. Each of 
these two now had a small case, 
about the size of a camera, slung 
by a strap across one brawny 
shoulder. 

As the terrestrials climbed out 
to meet them, the two men raised 
their hands and the crowd dis- 
continued its chatter, falling silent 
except for an occasional tinkle of 
surprised laughter. 

“Welcome,” said the first young 
man clearly. “It is a great pleasure 
for us to have our spaceport in use 
again. It has been many genera- 
tions since any ships have landed 
on it.” 

Farnum noticed that the voice 
came from the box. “Thank you 
for your very kind welcome,” he 
said. “I hope that your traffic will 
soon increase. May we congratu- 
late you, by the way, on the effi- 
ciency of your translators?” 

“Thanks,” laughed the young 
man. “But there was nothing to it 
We just asked the Oracle and he 
told us what we had to do to make 
them.” 

“May we meet your — Oracle?” 

“Oh, sure, if you want to. But 
later on. Now it’s time for a party. 
Why don’t you take off those 
clumsy suits and come along?” 

“We don’t dare remove our 
spacesuits. They protect us from 
any disease germs you may have, 



and you from any we may have. 
We probably have no resistance 
to each others’ ailments.” 

“The Oracle says we have 
nothing that will hurt you. And 
we’re going to spray you with this 
as soon as you get out of your 
suits. Then you won’t hurt any of 
us.” He held up a small atomizer. 

Farnum glanced at Bates, who 
shrugged and nodded. They un- 
easily unfastened their spacesuits 
and stepped out of them, wearing 
only their light one-piece cover- 
alls, and got sprayed with a pleas- 
ant-smelling mist. 

The party was a great success. 
The food was varied and delicious. 
The liquors were sparkling and 
stimulating, without unpleasant af- 
ter-effects. The women were unin- 
hibited. 

When a native got tired, he 
just dropped down onto the soft 
grass, or onto an even softer couch, 
and went to sleep. The Earthmen 
finally did the same. 

r I ’HEY awoke the following 
morning within minutes of each 
other, feeling comfortable and re- 
laxed. Bates shook his head ex- 
perimentally. “No hangover,” he 
muttered in surprise. 

“No one ever feels bad after a 
party,” said one of their guides, 
who had slept nearby. “The Oracle 
told us what to do, when we asked 
him.” 

“Quite a fellow, your Oracle,”

commented Bates. “Does he an- 
swer you in riddles, like most 
Oracles?” 

The guide was shocked. “The 
Oracle answers any questions 
promptly and completely. He 
never talks in riddles.” 

“Can we go to see him now?” 
asked Farnum. 

“Certainly. Come along. I’ll take 
you to the Hall of the Oracle.” 
The Oracle appeared to live in 
a building of modest size, in the 
center of a tremendous courtyard. 
The structure that surrounded the 
courtyard, in contrast, was enor- 
mous and elaborate, dominating 
the wildly architectured city. It 
was, however, empty. 

“Scholars used to live in this 
building, they tell me,” said one 
of their guides, gesturing casually. 
“They used to come here to learn 
from the Oracle. But there’s no 
sense in learning a lot of stuff 
when the Oracle has always got all 
the answers anyway. So now the 
building is empty. The big palace 
was built back in the days when 
we used to travel among the stars, 
as you do now.” 

“How long ago was that?” asked 
Farnum. 

“Oh, I don’t know. A few thou- 
sand years — a few hundred years 
— the Oracle can tell you if you 
really want to know.” 

Bates raised an eyebrow. “And 
how do you know you’ll always be 
given the straight dope?” 



The guide looked indignant. 
“The Oracle always tells the truth.” 

“Yes,” Bates persisted, “but how 
do you know?” 

“The Oracle told us so, of course. 
Now why don’t you go in and find 
out for yourselves? We’ll wait out 
here. We don’t have anything to 
ask him.” 

"DATES and Farnum went into 
the building and found them- 
selves in a small, pleasant room 
furnished with comfortable chairs 
and sofas. 

“Good morning,” said a well- 
modulated voice. “I have been ex- 
pecting you.” 

“You are the Oracle?” asked 
Farnum, looking around curiously. 

“The name that the people of 
this planet have given me trans- 
lates most accurately as ‘Oracle’,” 
said the voice. 

“But are you actually an 
Oracle?” 

“My principal function, insofar 
as human beings — that is, Homo 
sapiens — are concerned, is to give 
accurate answers to all questions 
propounded me. Therefore, insofar 
as humans are concerned, I am ac- 
tually an Oracle.” 

“Then you have another func- 
tion?” 

“My principal function, insofar 
as the race that made me is con- 
cerned, is to act as a weapon.” 

“Oh, said Bates. “Then you are 
a machine?” 



PERFECT ANSWER

“I am a machine,” agreed the 
voice. 

“The people who brought us 
here said that you always tell them 
the truth. I suppose that applies 
when you are acting as an Oracle, 
instead of as a weapon?” 

“On the contrary,” said the voice 
blandly. “I function as a weapon 
by telling the truth.” 

“That doesn’t make sense,” pro- 
tested Bates. 

The machine paused for a mo- 
ment before replying. “This will 
take a little time, gentlemen,” it 
said, “but I am sure that I can 
convince you. Why don’t you sit 
down and be comfortable? If you 
want refreshments, just ask for 
them.” 

“Might as well,” said Bates, sit- 
ting down in an easy chair. “How 
about giving us some Korite God- 
food?” 

“If you really want that bad a 
brew of coffee, I can make it for 
you, of course,” said the voice, “but 
I am sure you would prefer some 
of better quality.” 

Farnum laughed. “Yes, please. 
Some good coffee, if you don’t 
mind.” 

^iyr OW,” said the Oracle, after 
’ excellent coffee had been 
produced, “it is necessary for me to 
go back into history a few hundred 
thousand of your years. At that 
time, the people who made me en- 
tered this galaxy on one of their 



periodic visits of routine explora- 
tion, and contacted your ancestors. 
The race that constructed me pop- 
ulates now, as it did then, the 
Greater Magellanic Cloud. 

“Frankly, the Magellanic race 
was appalled at what they found. 
In the time since their preceding 
visit, your race had risen from the 
slime of your mother planet and 
was on its way toward stars. The 
speed of your development was 
unprecedented in millions of years 
of history. By their standards, your 
race was incredibly energetic, in- 
credibly fecund, incredibly intelli- 
gent, unbelievably warlike, and al- 
most completely depraved. 

“Extrapolation revealed that 
within another fifty thousand of 
your years, you would complete 
the population of this galaxy and 
would be totally unstoppable. 

“Something had to be done, fast. 
There were two obvious solutions 
but both were unacceptable to my 
Makers. The first was to assume 
direct control over your race and 
to maintain that rule indefinitely, 
until such time as you changed 
your natures sufficiently to become 
civilizable. The expenditure of 
energy would be enormous and the 
results probably catastrophic to 
your race. No truly civilized peo- 
ple could long contemplate such 
a solution. 

“The second obvious answer 
was to attempt to extirpate you 
from this universe as if you were 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a disease— as, in a sense, you are. 
Because your depravity was not 
total or necessarily permanent, this 
solution was also abhorrent to my 
Makers and was rejected. 

“What was needed was a 
weapon that would keep operating 
without direct control by my Peo- 
ple, which would not result in any 
greater destruction or harm to hu- 
mans than was absolutely neces- 
sary; and one which would cease 
entirely to operate against you if 
you changed sufficiently to become 
civilizable— to become good neigh- 
bors to my Makers. 

“The final solution of the Magel- 
lanic race was, to construct several 
thousand spaceships, each contain- 
ing an elaborate computer, con- 
structed so as to give accurate an- 
swers throughout your galaxy. I 
am one of those ships. We have 
performed our function in a satis- 
factory manner and will continue 
to do so as long as we are needed.” 
“And that makes you a 
weapon?” asked Bates incredulous- 
ly. “I don’t get. it.” 

ARNUM felt a shiver go 
through him. “I see it. The 
concept is completely diabolical.” 
“It’s not diabolical at all,” an- 
swered the Oracle. “When you be- 
come capable of civilization, we 
can do you no further harm at all. 
We will cease to be a weapon at 
that time.” 

“You mean you’ll stop telling 



the truth at that time?” asked 
Bates. 

“We will continue to function in 
accordance with our design,” an- 
swered the voice, “but it will no 
longer do you harm. Incidentally, 
your phrase ‘telling the truth’ is 
almost meaningless. We answer all 
questions in the manner most com- 
pletely understandable to you, 
within the framework of your lan- 
guage and your understanding, and 
of the understanding and knowl- 
edge of our Makers. In the objec- 
tive sense, what we answer is not 
necessarily the Truth; it is merely 
the truest form of the answer that 
we can state in a manner that you 
can understand.” 

“And you’ll answer any ques- 
tion at all?” asked Bates in some 
excitement. 

“With one or two exceptions. 
We will not, for example, tell you 
how we may be destroyed.” 

Bates stood up and began pac- 
ing the floor. “Then whoever pos- 
sesses you can be the most power- 
ful man in the Universe!” 

“No. Only in this galaxy.” 
“That’s good enough for me!” 
“Jack,” said Farnum urgently, 
“let’s get out of here. I want to 
talk to you.” 

“In a minute, in a minute,” 
said Bates impatiently. “I’ve got 
one more question.” He turned to 
face the wall from which the dis- 
embodied voice appeared to 
emanate. “Is it possible to arrange

109 



it so that you would answer only 
one man’s questions — mine, for 
example?” 

“I can tell you how to arrange 
it so that I will respond to only 
your questions— for so long as you 
are alive.” 

“Come on,” pleaded Farnum. 
“I’ve got to talk to you right now.” 
“Okay,” said Bates, smiling. 
“Let’s go.” 

HEN they were back in their 
ship, Farnum turned desper- 
ately to Bates. “Can’t you see what 
a deadly danger that machine is to 
us all? We’ve got to warn Earth 
as fast as we can and get them to 
quarantine this planet — and any 
other planets we find that have 
Oracles.” 

“Oh, no, you don’t,” said Bates. 
“You aren’t getting the chance to 
have the Oracle all to yourself. 
With that machine, we can rule 
the whole galaxy. We’ll be the 
most powerful people who ever 
lived! It’s sure lucky for us that 
you won the toss of the coin and 
we stopped here.” 

“But don’t you see that the 
Oracle will destroy Earth?” 
“Bushwah. You heard it say it 
can only destroy people who aren’t 
civilized. It said that it’s a space- 
ship, so I’ll bet we can get it to 
come back to Earth with us, and 
tell us how we can be the only 
ones who can use it.” 

“We’ve got to leave here right 



away— without asking it any more 
questions.” 

Bates shook his head. “Quit 
clowning.” 

“I never meant anything more 
in my life. Once we start using that 
machine— if we ask it even one 
question to gain advantage for our- 
selves — Earth’s civilization is 
doomed. Can’t you see that’s what 
happened to those other planets 
we visited? Can’t you see what is 
happening to this planet we’re on 
now?” 

“No, I can’t,” answered Bates 
stubbornly. “The Oracle said there 
are only a few thousand like him. 
You could travel through space for 
hundreds of years and never be 
lucky enough to find one. There 
can’t be an Oracle on every planet 
we visited.” 

“There wouldn’t have to be,” 
said Farnum. “There must be hun- 
dreds of possible patterns — all of 
them destructive in the presence 
of greed and laziness and lust for 
power. For example, a planet— 
maybe this one — gets space travel. 
It sets up colonies on several 
worlds. It’s expanding and dy- 
namic. Then it finds an Oracle 
and takes it back to its own world. 
With all questions answered for 
it, the civilization stops being 
dynamic and starts to stagnate. It 
stops visiting its colonies and they 
drift toward barbarism. 

“Later,” Farnum went on ur- 
gently, “somebody else reaches the 




110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stars, finds the planet with the 
Oracle — and takes the thing back 
home. Can you imagine what will 
happen to these people on this 
world if they lose their Oracle? 
Their own learning and traditions 
and way of life have been de- 
stroyed — just take a look at their 
anarchic clothing and architecture. 
The Oracle is the only thing that 
keeps them going — downhill — 
and makes sure they don’t start 
back again.” 

“It won’t happen that way to 
us,” Bates argued. “We won’t let 
the Oracle get into general use, 
so Earth won’t ever learn to de- 
pend on it. I’m going to find out 
from it how to make it work for 
the two of us alone. You can come 
along and share the gravy or not, 
as you choose. I don’t care. But 
you aren’t going to stop me.” 

Bates turned and strode out of 
the ship. 

T^ARNUM pounded his fist into 
*- his palm in despair, and then 
ran to a locker. Taking out a high- 
power express rifle, he loaded it 
carefully and stepped out through 
the airlock. Bates showed clearly 
in his telescopic sights, still walk- 
ing toward the Hall of the Oracle. 
Famum fired at the legs, but he 



wasn’t that good a shot; the bul- 
let went through the back. 

Famum jittered between bring- 
ing Bates back and taking off as 
fast as the ship could go. The body 
still lay there, motionless; there 
was nothing he could do for the 
Oracle’s first Earth victim — the 
first and the last, he swore grimly. 
He had to speed home and make 
them understand the danger before 
they found another planet with 
an Oracle, so that they could keep 
clear of its deadly temptatoins. 
The Magellanic race could be out- 
witted yet, in spite of their lethal 
cleverness. 

Then he felt a sudden icy chill 
along his spine. Alone, he could 
never operate the spaceship — and 
Bates was dead. He was trapped 
on the planet. 

For hours, he tried to think of 
some way of warning Earth. It was 
imperative that he get back. There 
had to be a way. 

He realized finally that there 
was only one solution to his prob- 
lem. He sighed shudderingly and 
walked slowly from the space- 
ship toward the Hall of the Oracle, 
past Bates’ body. 

“One question, though,” he mut- 
tered to himself. “Only one.”

E verybody has his song, 

thought Anton Perceveral. 
A pretty girl is like a melo- 
dy, and a brave spaceman like a 
flurry of trumpets. Wise old men on 
the Interplanetary Council make 
one think of richly blended wood- 
winds. There are geniuses whose 
lives are an intricate counterpoint 
endlessly embellished, and scum of 
the planets whose existence seems 
nothing more than the wail of an 
oboe against the inexorable pound- 
ing of a brass drum. 

Perceval thought about this, 
loosely gripping a razor blade and 
contemplating the faint blue veins 
in his wrist. 

For if everybody has his song, 
his could be likened to a poorly 
conceived and miserably executed 
symphony of errors. 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



113 



There had been muted horns 
of gladness at his birth. Bravely, 
to the sound of muffled drums, 
young Perceval had ventured into 
school. He had excelled and been 
promoted to a small workshop 
class of five hundred pupils, where 
he could receive a measure of in- 
dividual attention. The future had 
looked promising. 

But he was congenitally un- 
lucky. There was a constant series 
of small accidents with overturned 
inkwells, lost books and misplaced 
papers. Things had a damnable 
propensity for breaking under his 
fingers; or sometimes his fingers 
broke under things. To make mat- 
ters worse, he caught every pos- 
sible childhood disease, including 
proto-Measles, Algerian Mumps, 
Impetigo, Foxpox, Green Fever 
and Orange Fever. 

These things in no way reflected 
upon Perceval’s native ability; but 
one needs more than ability in a 
crowded and competitive world. 
One needs considerable luck, and 
Perceval had none. He was trans- 
ferred to an ordinary class of ten 
thousand students, where his prob- 
lems were intensified and his op- 
portunities for catching disease ex- 
panded. 

TTE was a tall, thin, bespec- 
tacled, good-hearted, hard- 
working young man whom the 
doctors early diagnosed as acci- 
dent-prone, for reasons which de- 



fied their analysis. But whatever 
the reasons, the facts remained. 
Perceveral was one of those un- 
happy people for whom life is dif- 
ficult to the point of impossibility. 

Most people slip through the 
jungle of human existence with the 
facility of prowling panthers. But, 
for the Perceverals, the jungle is 
continually beset with traps, snares 
and devices, sudden precipices and 
unfordable streams, deadly fungus 
and deadlier beasts. No way is safe. 
All roads lead to disaster. 

Young Perceveral won his way 
through college in spite of his re- 
markable talent for breaking his 
leg on winding staircases, twist- 
ing his ankle on curbstones, frac- 
turing his elbow in revolving doors, 
smashing his glasses against plate- 
glass windows, and all the rest of 
the sad, ludicrous, painful events 
which beset the accident-prone. 
Manfully he resisted the solace of 
hypochondria and kept trying. 

Upon graduation from college, 
Perceveral took himself firmly in 
hand and tried to reassert the early 
clear theme of hope set by his stal- 
wart father and gentle mother. 
With a ruffle of drums and a thrill- 
ing of chords, Perceveral entered 
the island of Manhattan, to forge 
his destiny. He worked hard to 
conquer his unhappy predisposi- 
tion, and to stay cheerful and 
optimistic in spite of everything. 

But his predisposition caught up 
with him. The noble chords dis- 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



solved into vague mutterings, and 
the symphony of his life degener- 
ated to the level of opera-bouffe. 
Perceveral lost job after job in a 
snarl of broken voxwriters and 
smeared contracts, forgotten file 
cards and misplaced data sheets; 
in a mounting crescendo of ribs 
wrenched in the subway rush, 
ankles sprained on gratings, glasses 
smashed against unseen projec- 
tions, and in a bout of illnesses 
which included Hepatitis Type J, 
Martian Flu, Venusian Flu, Wak- 
ing Sickness and Giggling Fever. 

Perceveral still resisted the lure 
of hypochondria. He dreamed of 
space, of the iron-jawed adven- 
turers advancing Man’s frontier, of 
the new settlements on distant 
planets, of vast expanses of open 
land where, far from the hectic 
plastic jungles of Earth, a man 
could really find himself. He ap- 
plied to the Planetary Exploration 
& Settlement Board, and was 
turned down. Reluctantly he 
pushed the dream aside and tried 
a variety of jobs. He underwent 
Analysis, Hypnotic Suggestion, 
Hypnotic Hypersuggestion and 
Countersuggestion Removal — all 
to no avail. 

Every man has his limits and 
every symphony has its end. Per- 
ceveral gave up hope at the age 
of thirty-four when he was fired, 
after three days, from a job he 
had sought for two months. That, 
as far as he was concerned, pro- 



vided the final humorous off-key 
cymbal clash to something which 
probably shouldn’t have been 
started in the first place. 

RIMLY he took his meager 
'J paycheck, accepted a last 
wary handshake from his former 
employer, and rode the elevator to 
the lobby. Already vague thoughts 
of suicide were crossing his mind 
in the form of truck wheels, gas 
pipes, tall buildings and swift 
rivers. 

The elevator reached the great 
marble lobby with its uniformed 
riot policemen and its crowds wait- 
ing admittance to the midtown 
streets. Perceveral waited on line, 
idly watching the Population Den- 
sity Meter fluctuate below the 
panic line, until his turn came. 
Outside, he joined a compact body 
of people moving westward in the 
direction of his housing project. 

Suicidal thoughts continued to 
flow through his mind, more slow- 
ly now, taking more definite forms. 
He considered methods and means 
until he reached home. There he. 
disengaged himself from the crowd 
and slipped in through an entry 
port. 

He struggled against a flood of 
children pouring through corridors, 
and reached his city-provided 
cubicle. He entered, closed and 
locked the door, and took a razor 
blade from his shaving kit. He lay 
down on the bed, propping his 



THE MINIMUM MAN

feet against the opposite wall, and 
contemplated the faint blue veins 
of his wrist. 

Could he do it? Could he do it 
cleanly and quickly, without error 
and without regret? Or would he 
bungle this job, too, and be 
dragged screaming to a hospital, 
a ludicrous sight for the interns 
to snicker about? 

As he was thinking, a yellow 
envelope was slipped under his 
door. It was a telegram, arriving 
pat on the hour of decision, with a 
melodramatic suddenness which 
Perceveral considered quite sus- 
pect. Still, he put down the razor 
blade and picked up the envelope. 

It was from the Planetary Ex- 
ploration & Settlement Board, the 
great organization that controlled 
every Earthman’s movements in 
space. With trembling fingers, Per- 
ceveral opened the envelope and 
read: 

Mr. Anton Perceveral 
Temporary Housing Project 1993 
District 43825, Manhattan 212, N.Y. 
Dear Mr. Perceveral: 

Three years ago you applied to 
us for a position in any off-Earth 
capacity. Regretfully we had to turn 
you down at that time. Your records 
have been kept on file, however, and 
have recently been brought up to 
date. I am happy to inform you that 
a position is immediately available 
for you, one which I consider well 
suited to your particular talents and 
qualifications. I believe this job will 



meet with your approval, carrying, 
as it does, a salary of $20,000 a 
year, all government fringe benefits, 
and an unexcelled opportunity for 
advancement 

Could you come in and discuss 
it with me? 

Sincerely, 

William Haskell 
Asst Placement Director 
WH/ibm3dc 

Perceveral folded the telegram 
carefully and put it back in its 
envelope. His first feeling of in- 
tense joy vanished, to be replaced 
by a sense of apprehension. 

What talents and qualifications 
did he have for a job commanding 
twenty thousand a year and bene- 
fits? Could they be confusing him 
with a different Anton Perceveral? 

It seemed unlikely. The Board 
just didn’t do that sort of thing. 
And presuming that they knew 
him and his ill-starred past— what 
could they possibly want from 
him? What could he do that prac- 
tically any man, woman or child 
couldn’t do better? 

Perceveral put the telegram in 
his pocket and replaced the razor 
blade in his shaving kit. Suicide 
seemed a little premature now. 
First he would find out what Has- 
kell wanted. 

A T the headquarters of the Plan- 
etary Exploration & Settle- 
ment Board, Perceveral was 
admitted at once to William Has- 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



kell’s private office. The Assistant 
Placement Director was a large, 
blunt-featured, white-haired man 
who radiated a geniality which 
Perceveral found suspicious. 

“Sit down, sit down, Mr. Per- 
ceveral,” Haskell said. “Cigarette? 
Care for a drink? Awfully glad you 
could make it” 

“Are you sure you have the right 
man?” Perceveral asked. 

Haskell glanced through a dos- 
sier on his desk. “Let’s see. Anton 
Perceveral; age thirty-four; par- 
ents, Gregory James Perceveral 
and Anita Swaans Perceveral, 
Laketown, New Jersey. Is that 
right?” 

“Yes,” Perceveral said. “And 
you have a job for me?” 

“We have indeed.” 

“Paying twenty thousand a year 
and benefits?” 

“Perfectly correct.” 

“Could you tell me what the 
job is?” 

“That’s what we’re here for,” 
Haskell said cheerfully. “The job 
I have in mind for you, Mr. Per- 
ceveral, is listed in our catalogue 
as Extraterrestrial Explorer.” 

“I beg your pardon?” 
“Extraterrestrial or alien-planet 
explorer,” Haskell said. “The ex- 
plorers, you know, are the men 
who make the first contacts on 
alien planets, the primary settlers 
who gather our essential data. I 
think of them as the Drakes and 
Magellans of this century. It is, I 



think you’ll agree, an excellent op- 
portunity.” 

Perceveral stood up, his face a 
dull red. “If you’re finished with 
the joke. I’ll leave.” 

“Eh?” 

“Me an extraterrestrial ex- 
plorer?” Perceveral said with a bit- 
ter laugh. “Don’t try to kid me. I 
read the papers. I know what the 
explorers are like.” 

“What are they like?” 

“They’re Earth’s finest,” Per- 
ceveral said. “The very best brains 
in the very best bodies. Men with 
trigger-quick reactions, able to 
tackle any problems, cope with 
any situation, adjust to any en- 
vironment. Isn’t that true?” 

“Well,” Haskell said, “it was 
true back in the early days of 
planetary exploration. And we 
have allowed that stereotype to 
remain in the public eye, to instill 
confidence. But that type of ex- 
plorer is now obsolete. There are 
plenty of other jobs for men such 
as you describe. But not planetary 
exploration.” 

W /WOULDN’T your supermen 
make the grade?” Per- 
ceveral asked with a faint sneer. 

“Of course they could,” Haskell 
said. “No paradox is involved here. 
The record of our early explorers 
is unsurpassed. Those men man- 
aged to survive on every planet 
where human survival was even 
remotely possible, against over-

whelming odds, by sheer grit and 
tenacity. The planets called for 
their every resource and they rose 
to meet the challenge. They stand 
as an eternal monument to the 
toughness and adaptability of 
Homo sapiens.” 

“Then why did you stop using 
them?” 

“Because our problems on Earth 
changed,” Haskell told him. “In 
the early days, the exploration of 
space was an adventure, a scien- 
tific achievement, a defense meas- 
ure, a symbol. But that passed. 
Earth’s overpopulation trend con- 
tinued — explosively. Millions 
spilled into relatively empty lands 
like Brazil, New Guinea and Aus- 
tralia. But the population explo- 
sion quickly filled them. In major 
cities, the population-panic-point 
was reached and produced the 
Weekend Riots. And the popula- 
tion, bolstered by geriatrics and a 
further sharp decrease in infant 
mortality, continued to grow.” 

Haskell rubbed his forehead. “It 
was a mess. But the ethics of 
population increase aren’t my busi- 
ness. All we at the Board knew 
was, we had to have new land 
fast We needed planets which— 
unlike Mars and Venus — would 
be rapidly self-supporting. Places 
to which we could siphon millions, 
while the scientists and politicians 
on Earth tried to straighten things 
out. We had to open these planets 
to colonization as rapidly as pos- 



sible. And that meant speeding up 
the initial exploratory process.” 

“I know all that,” Perceveral 
said. “But I still don’t see why 
you stopped using the optimum ex- 
plorer type.” 

“Isn’t it obvious? We were look- 
ing for places where ordinary peo- 
ple could settle and survive. Our 
optimum explorer type was not 
ordinary. Quite the contrary, he 
almost approximated a new spe- 
cies. And he was no judge of 
ordinary survival conditions. For 
example, there are bleak, dreary, 
rain-swept little planets that the 
average colonist finds depressing 
to the point of insanity; but our 
optimum explorer is too sound to 
be disturbed by climatic monotony. 
Germs which devastate thousands 
give him, at most, a bad time 
for a while. Dangers which can 
push a colony to the brink of 
disaster, our optimum explorer 
simply evades. He can’t assess 
these things in everyday terms. 
They simply don’t touch him.” 

“I’m beginning to see,” Percev- 
eral said. 

“Now the best way,” Haskell 
said, “would have been to attack 
these planets in stages. First an 
explorer, then a basic research 
team, then a trial colony composed 
largely of psychologists and so- 
ciologists, then a research group to 
interpret the findings of the other 
groups, and so forth. But there’s 
never enough time or money for

all that. We need those colonies 
right now, not in fifty years.” 

1%/f R. Haskell paused and looked 
hard at Perceveral. “So, you 
see, we must have immediate 
knowledge as to whether a group 
of ordinary people could live and 
thrive on any new planet. That’s 
why we changed our qualifications 
for explorers.” 

Perceveral nodded. “Ordinary 
explorers for ordinary people. 
There’s just one thing, however.” 
“Yes?” 

“I don’t know how well you 
know my background . .” 

“Quite well,” Haskell assured 
him. 

“Then you might have noticed 
that I have certain tendencies 
toward — well, a certain accident- 
proneness. To tell you the honest 
truth, I have a hard time surviv- 
ing right here on Earth.” 

“I know,” Mr. Haskell said 
pleasantly. 

“Then how would I make out 
on an alien planet? And why 
would you want me?” 

Mr. Haskell looked slightly ill 
at ease. “Well, you stated our po- 
sition wrongly when you said ‘or- 
dinary explorers for ordinary peo- 
ple.’ It isn’t that simple. A colony 
is composed of thousands, often 
millions of people, who vary con- 
siderably in their survival poten- 
tialities. Humanity and the law 
state that all of them must have 



a fighting chance. The people 
themselves must be reassured be- 
fore they’ll leave Earth. We must 
convince them — and the law — 
and ourselves— that even the weak- 
est will have a chance for sur- 
vival.” 

“Go on,” Perceveral said. 

“Therefore,” Haskell said quick- 
ly, “some years ago we stopped 
using the optimum-survival ex- 
plorer, and began using the mini- 
mum-survival explorer.” 

Perceveral sat for a while di- 
gesting this information. “So you 
want me because any place 1 can 
live in, anyone can live in.” 

“That more or less sums up our 
thinking on the problem,” Haskell 
said, smiling genially. 

“But what would my chances 
be?” 

“Some of our minimum-survival 
explorers have done very well.” 

“And others?” 

“There are hazards, of course,” 
Haskell admitted. “And aside from 
the potential dangers of the planet 
itself, there are other risks involved 
in the very nature of the >, experi- 
ment I can’t even tell you what 
they are, since that would destroy 
our only control element on the 
minimum-survival test. I simply 
tell you that they are present.” 

“Not a very good outlook,” Per- 
ceveral said. 

“Perhaps not. But think of the 
rewards if you won through! You 
would, in effect, be the founding 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



119 



father of a colony! Your value as 
an expert would be immeasurable. 
You would have a permanent 
place in the life of the community. 
And equally important, you might 
be able to dispel certain insidious 
self-doubts concerning your place 
in the scheme of things.” 

Perceveral nodded reluctantly. 
“Tell me one thing. Your telegram 
arrived today at a particularly 
crucial moment. It seemed al- 
most—” 

“Yes, it was planned,” Haskell 
said. “We’ve found that the peo- 
ple we want are most receptive 
when they’ve reached a certain 
psychological state. We keep close 
watch over the few who fit our re- 
quirements, waiting for the right 
moment to make our presentation.” 

“It might have been embar- 
rassing if you’d been an hour 
later,” Perceveral said. 

“Or unfruitful if we’d been a 
day earlier.” Haskell arose from 
behind his desk. “Would you join 
me for lunch, Mr. Perceveral? We 
can discuss final details over a 
bottle of wine.” 

“All right,” Perceveral said. 
“But I’m not making any promises 
yet” 

“Of course not,” Haskell said, 
opening the door for him. 

A FTER lunch, Perceveral did 
some hard thinking. The ex- 
plorer’s job appealed to him 
strongly in spite of the risks. It 



was, after all, no more dangerous 
than suicide, and much better pay- 
ing. The rewards were great if he 
won; the penalty for failure was 
no more than the price he had 
been about to pay for failure on 
Earth. 

He hadn’t done well in thirty- 
four years on Earth. The best he 
had shown were flashes of ability 
marred by a strong affinity for ill- 
ness, accident and blunder. But 
Earth was crowded, cluttered and 
confused. Perhaps his accident- 
proneness had been not some 
structural flaw in him but the 
product of intolerable conditions. 

Exploration Would give him a 
new environment. He would be 
alone, dependent only on himself, 
answerable only to himself. It 
would be tremendously dangerous 
— but what could be more dan- 
gerous than a glittering razor blade 
held in his own hand? 

This would be the supreme ef- 
fort of his life, the ultimate test 
He would fight as he had never 
fought before to conquer his fatal 
tendencies. And this time he would 
throw every ounce of strength and 
determination into the struggle. 

He accepted the job. In the 
next weeks of preparation, he ate 
and drank and slept determination, 
hammered it into his brain and 
wove it between his nerves, mum- 
bled it to himself like a Buddhist 
prayer, dreamed about it, brushed 
his teeth and washed his hands 



120

with it, meditated upon it until 
the monotonous refrain buzzed in 
his head waking and sleeping, and 
began slowly to act as a check 
and restraint upon action. 

The day arrived when he was 
assigned a year’s tour of duty 
upon a promising planet in the 
East Star Ridge. Haskell wished 
him luck and promised to stay in 
touch by L-phase radio. Percev- 
eral and his equipment were put 
aboard the picket ship Queen of 
Glasgow, and the adventure was 
begun. 

During the months in space, 
Perceveral continued to think ob- 
sessively of his resolve. He han- 
dled himself carefully in no-weight, 
watched his every movement and 
cross-checked his every motive. 
This continuous inspection slowed 
him down considerably; but grad- 
ually it became habitual. A set of 
new reflexes began to form, strug- 
gling to conquer the old reflex 
system. 

But progress was spasmodic. In 
spite of his efforts, Perceveral 
caught a minor skin irritation from 
the ship’s purification system, 
broke one of his ten pairs of 
glasses against a bulkhead, and 
suffered numerous headaches, 
backaches, skinned knuckles and 
stubbed toes. 

Still, he felt he had made 
progress, and his resolution hard- 
ened accordingly. And at last his 
planet came into view. 



r | ''HE planet was named Theta. 

Perceveral and his equipment 
were set down on a grassy, forested 
upland near a mountain range. The 
area had been pre-selected by air 
survey for its promising qualities. 
Water, wood, local fruits and min- 
eral-bearing ores were all nearby. 
The area could make an excellent 
colony site. 

The ship’s officers wished him 
luck, and departed. Perceveral 
watched until the ship vanished 
into a bank of clouds. Then he 
went to work. 

First he activated his robot. It 
was a tall, gleaming, black multi- 
purpose machine, standard equip- 
ment for explorers and settlers. It 
couldn’t talk, sing, recite or play 
cards like the more expensive 
models. Its only response was a 
headshake or a nod; dull compan- 
ionship for the year ahead. But it 
was programmed to handle verbal 
work-commands of a considerable 
degree of complexity, to perform 
the heaviest labor, and to show a 
degree of foresight in problem 
situations. 

With the robot’s help, Percev- 
eral set up his camp on the plain, 
keeping a careful check on the 
horizon for signs of trouble. The 
air survey had detected no signs 
of an alien culture, but you could 
never tell. And the nature of 
Theta’s animal life was still unin- 
vestigated. 

He worked slowly and carefully, 



THE MINIMUM MAN

and the silent robot worked be- 
side him. By evening, he had set 
up a temporary camp. He ac- 
tivated the radar alarm and went 
to bed. 

He awoke just after dawn to the 
shrilling of the radar alarm bell. 
He dressed and hurried outside. 
There was an angry humming in 
the air, like the sound of a locust 
horde. 

“Get two beamers,” he told the 
robot, “and hurry back. Bring the 
binoculars, too.” 

The robot nodded and lurched 
off. Perceveral turned slowly, shiv- 
ering in the gray dawn, trying to 
locate the direction of the sound. 
He scanned the damp plain, the 
green edge of forest, the cliffs be- 
yond. Nothing moved. Then he 
saw, outlined against the sunrise, 
something that looked like a low 
dark cloud. The cloud was fly- 
ing toward his camp, moving very 
quickly against the wind. 

The robot returned with the 
beamers. Perceveral took one and 
directed the robot to hold the 
other, awaiting orders to fire. The 
robot nodded, his eyecells gleam- 
ing dully as he turned toward the 
sunrise. 

VW/’HEN the cloud swept nearer, 
it resolved into a gigantic 
flock of birds. Perceveral studied 
them through his binoculars. They 
were about the size of Terran 
hawks, but their darting, erratic 



flight resembled the flight of bats. 
They were heavily taloned and 
their long beaks were edged with 
sharp teeth. With all that lethal 
armament, they had to be car- 
nivorous. 

The flock circled them, hum- 
ming loudly. Then, from all direc- 
tions, with wings swept back and 
talons spread, they began to dive. 
Perceveral directed the robot to 
begin firing. 

He and the robot stood back to 
back, blasting into the onslaught 
of birds. There was a whirling con- 
fusion of blood and feathers as 
battalions of birds were scythed 
out of the sky. Perceveral and 
the robot were holding their own, 
keeping the aerial wolf pack at a 
distance, even beating it back. 
Then Perceveral’s beamer failed. 

The beamers were supposed to 
be fully charged and guaranteed 
for seventy-five hours at full auto- 
matic. A beamer couldn’t fail! He 
stood for a moment, stupidly click- 
ing the trigger. Then he flung 
down the weapon and hurried to 
the supplies tent, leaving the robot 
to continue the fight alone. 

He located his two spares and 
came out. When he rejoined the 
battle, he saw that the robot’s 
beamer had stopped functioning. 
The robot stood erect, beating off 
the swarm of birds with his arms. 
Drops of oil sprayed from his 
joints as he flailed at the dense 
flock. He swayed, dangerously 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



close to losing his balance, and 
Perceveral saw that some birds 
had evaded his swinging arms and 
were perched on his shoulders, 
pecking at his eyecells and kines- 
thetic antenna. 

Perceveral swung up both beam- 
ers and began to cut into the 
swarm. One weapon failed almost 
immediately. He continued chop- 
ping with the last, praying it would 
retain its charge. 

The flock, finally alarmed by 
its losses, rose and wheeled away, 
screaming and hooting. Miracu- 
lously unhurt, Perceveral and the 
robot stood knee-deep in scattered 
feathers and charred bodies. 

Perceveral looked at the four 
beamers, three of which had failed 
him entirely. Then he marched 
angrily to the communications 
tent. 

TTE contacted Haskell and told 
him about the attack of the 
birds and the failure of three beam- 
ers out of four. Red-faced with 
outrage, he denounced the men 
who were supposed to check an 
explorer's equipment. Then, out 
of breath, he waited for Haskell’s 
apology and explanation. 

“That,” Haskell said, “was one 
of the control elements.” 

“Huh?” 

“I explained it to you months 
ago,” Haskell said. “We are test- 
ing for minimum-survival condi- 
tions. Minimum, remember? We 



have to know what will happen 
to a colony composed of people of 
varying degrees of proficiency. 
Therefore, we look for the lowest 
denominator.” 

“I know all that. But the beam- 
ers—” 

“Mr. Perceveral, setting up a 
colony, even on an absolute mini- 
mum basis, is a fantastically ex- 
pensive operation. We supply our 
colonists with the newest and best 
in guns and equipment, but we 
can’t replace things that stop func- 
tioning or are used up. The colo- 
nists have to use irreplaceable 
ammunition, equipment that breaks 
and wears out, food stores that be- 
come exhausted or spoiled—” 

“And that’s what you’ve given 
me?” Perceveral asked. 

“Of course. As a control, we 
have equipped you with the mini- 
mum of survival equipment. That’s 
the only way we’ll be able to pre- 
dict how the colonists will make 
out on Theta.” 

“But it isn’t fair! Explorers al- 
ways get the best equipment!” 

“No,” Haskell said. “The old- 
style optimum-survival explorers 
did, of course. But we’re testing for 
least potential, which must extend 
to equipment as well as to per- 
sonality. I told you there would be 
risks.” 

“Yes, you did,” Perceveral said. 
“But . All right. Do you have 
any other little secrets in store 
for me?” 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



123 



“Not really,” Haskell said, after 
a momentary pause. “Both you 
and your equipment are of mini- 
mum-survival quality. That about 
sums it up.” 

Perceveral detected something 
evasive in this answer, but Haskell 
refused to be more specfiic. They 
signed off and Perceveral returned 
to the chaos of his camp. 

"DERCEVERAL and the robot 
moved their camp to the shel- 
ter of the forest for protection 
against further assaults by the 
birds. In setting up again, Per- 
ceveral noted that fully half of 
his ropes were badly worn, his 
electrical fixtures were beginning 
to burn out, and the canvas of his 
tents showed mildew. Laboriously 
he repaired everything, bruising his 
knuckles and skinning his palms. 
Then his generator broke down. 

He sweated over it for three 
days, trying to figure out the 
trouble from the badly printed in- 
struction book, written in German, 
that had been sent with the ma- 
chine. Nothing seemed to be set 
up right in the generator and 
nothing worked. At last he dis- 
covered, by pure accident, that 
the book was meant for an entire- 
ly different model. He lost his tem- 
per at this and kicked the gen- 
erator, almost breaking the little 
toe of his right foot. 

Then he took himself firmly in 
hand and worked for another four 



days, figuring out the differences 
between his model and the model 
described, until he had the gener- 
ator working again. 

The birds found that they could 
plummet through the trees into 
Perceveral’s camp, snatch food and 
be gone before the beamer could 
be leveled at them. Their attacks 
cost Perceveral a pair of glasses 
and a nasty wound on the neck. 
Laboriously he wove nets, and, 
with the robot’s help, strung them 
in the branches above his camp. 

The birds were baffled. Percev- 
eral finally had time to check his 
food stores, and to discover that 
many of his dehydrated staples 
had been poorly processed, and 
others had become a host to an 
ugly airborne fungus. Either way, 
it added up to spoilage. Unless he 
took measures now, he would be 
short of food during the Thetan 
winter. 

He ran a series of tests on local 
fruits, grains, berries and vege- 
tables. They showed several vari- 
eties to be safe and nourishing. He 
ate these, and broke into a spec- 
tacular allergy rash. Painstaking 
work with his medical kit gave him 
a cure for the allergy, and he set 
up a test to discover the guilty 
plant. But just as he was check- 
ing final results, the robot stamped 
in, upsetting test tubes and spill- 
ing irreplaceable chemicals. 

Perceveral had to continue the 
allergy tests on himself, and to 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



exclude one berry and two vege- 
tables as unfit for his consumption. 

But the fruits were excellent 
and the local grains made a fine 
bread. Perceveral collected seed, 
and, late in the Thetan spring, di- 
rected the robot to the tasks of 
plowing and planting. 

r I "'HE robot worked tirelessly in 
the new fields, while Percev- 
eral did some exploring. He found 
pieces of smooth rock upon which 
characters had been scratched, and 
what looked like numbers, and 
even little stick-pictures of trees 
and clouds and mountains. Intel- 
ligent beings must have lived on 
Theta, he decided. Quite probably 
they still inhabited some parts of 
the planet. But he had no time 
to search for them. 

When Perceveral checked his 
fields, he found that the robot had 
planted the seed inches too deep, 
in spite of his programmed in- 
structions. That crop was lost, 
and Perceveral planted the next 
by himself. 

He built a wooden shack and 
replaced the rotting tents with 
storage sheds. Slowly he made his 
preparations for survival through 
the winter. And slowly he began 
to suspect that his robot was wear- 
ing out. 

The great black all-purpose ma- 
chine performed its tasks as be- 
fore. But the robot’s movements 
were growing increasingly jerky 



and his use of strength was in- 
discriminate. Heavy jars splintered 
in his grip and farming implements 
broke when he used them. Percev- 
eral programmed him for weed- 
ing the fields, but the robot’s broad 
splay feet trampled the grain 
sprouts as his fingers plucked the 
weeds. When the robot went out 
to chop firewood, he usually suc- 
ceeded in breaking the axe handle. 
The cabin shook when the robot 
entered, and the door sometimes 
left its hinges. 

Perceveral wondered and wor- 
ried about the robot’s deteriora- 
tion. There was no way he could 
repair it, for the robot was a fac- 
tory-sealed unit, meant to be re- 
paired only by factory technicians 
with special tools, parts and knowl- 
edge. All Perceveral could do was 
retire the robot from service. But 
that would leave him completely 
alone. 

TIE programmed increasingly 
simple tasks into the robot 
and took more work upon himself. 
Still the robot continued to de- 
teriorate. Then one evening, when 
Perceveral was eating his dinner, 
the robot lurched against the stove 
and sent a pot of boiling rice fly- 
ing. 

With his new-found survival 
talents, Perceveral flung himself 
out of the way and the boiling 
mess landed on his left shoulder 
instead of his face. 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



125 



That was too much. The robot 
was dangerous to have around. 
After dressing his burn, Perceveral 
decided to turn the robot off and 
continue the work of survival 
alone. In a firm voice, he gave 
the Dormancy Command. 

The robot simply glared at him 
and moved restlessly around the 
cabin, not responding to a robot’s 
most basic command. 

Perceveral gave the order again. 
The robot shook his head and be- 
gan to stack firewood. 

Something had gone wrong. He 
would have to turn the robot off 
manually. But there was no sign 
of the usual cut-out switch any- 
where on the machine’s gleaming 
black surface. Nevertheless, Per- 
ceveral took out his tool kit and 
approached the robot. 

Amazingly, the robot backed 
away from him, arms raised de- 
fensively. 

“Stand still!” Perceveral shouted. 

The robot moved away until his 
back was against the wall. 

Perceveral hesitated, wondering 
what was going wrong. Machines 
weren’t permitted to disobey or- 
ders. And the willingness to give 
up life had been carefully struc- 
tured into all robotic devices. 

He advanced on the robot, de- 
termined to turn him off somehow. 
The robot waited until he was 
close, then swung an armored fist 
at him. Perceveral dodged out of 
the way and flung a wrench at 

126 



the robot’s kinesthetic antenna. 
The robot quickly retracted it and 
swung again. This time his ar- 
mored fist caught Perceveral in 
the ribs. 

Perceveral fell to the floor and 
the robot stood over him, his eye- 
cells flaring red and his iron fin- 
gers opening and closing. Percev- 
eral shut his eyes and waited for 
the coup de grace. But the ma- 
chine turned and left the shack, 
smashing the lock as he went. 

In a few minutes, Perceveral 
heard the sound of firewood being 
cut and stacked — as usual. 

With the aid of his medical kit, 
Perceveral taped up his side. The 
robot finished work and came back 
for further instructions. Shakily, 
Perceveral ordered him to a dis- 
tant spring for water. The robot 
left, showing no further signs of 
aggression. Perceveral dragged 
himself to the radio shack. 

^ V7" OU shouldn’t have tried to 
turn him off,” Haskell said, 
when he heard what had hap- 
pened. “He isn’t designed to be 
turned off. Wasn’t that apparent? 
For your own safety, don’t try it 
again.” 

“But what’s the reason?” 

“Because — as you’ve probably 
guessed by now — the robot acts 
as our quality-control over you.” 

“I don’t understand,” Perceveral 
said. “Why do you need a quality- 
control?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Must I go through it all again?” 
Haskell asked wearily. “You were 
hired as a minimum-survival ex- 
plorer. Not average. Not superior. 
Minimum.” 

“Yes, but 

ET me continue. Do you re- 
■“ call how you were during 
your thirty-four years on Earth? 
You were continually beset by acci- 
dent, disease and general misfor- 
tune. That is what we wanted on 
Theta. But you’ve changed, Mr. 
Perceveral.” 

“I’ve certainly tried to change.” 
“Of course,” Haskell said. “We 
expected it. Most of our minimum- 
survival explorers change. Faced 
with a new environment and a 
fresh start, they get a grip on 
themselves such as they’ve never 
had before. But it’s not what we’re 
testing for, so we have to compen- 
sate for the change. Colonists, you 
see, don’t always come to a planet 
in a spirit of self-improvement. 
And any colony has its careless 
ones, to say nothing of the aged, 
the infirm, the feeble-minded, the 
foolhardy, the inexperienced chil- 
dren, and so forth. Our minimum- 
survival standards are a guaran- 
tee that all of them will have a 
chance. Now are you beginning to 
understand?” 

“I think so,” Perceveral said. 
“That’s why we need a quality- 
control over you— to keep you 
from acquiring the average or su- 



perior survival qualities which we 
are not testing for.” 

“Therefore the robot,” Percev- 
eral said bleakly. 

“Correct. The robot has been 
programmed to act as a check, 
a final control over your survival 
tendencies. He reacts to you, Per- 
ceveral. As long as you stay within 
a pre-selected range of general in- 
competence, the robot operates at 
par. But when you improve, be- 
come more skillful at survival, less 
accident-prone, the robot’s be- 
havior deteriorates. He begins to 
break the things that you should 
be breaking, to form the wrong 
decisions you should be forming—” 
“That isn’t fair!” 

“Perceveral, you seem to feel 
that we’re running some kind of 
sanitarium or self-aid program for 
your benefit. Well, we’re not. We’re 
interested only in getting the job 
that we bought and paid for. The 
job, let me add, which you chose 
as an alternative to suicide.” 

“All right!” Perceveral shouted. 
“I’m doing the job. But is there 
any rule that says I can’t dis- 
mantle that damned robot?” 

“No rule at all,” Haskell said 
in a quieter voice, “if you can do 
it. But I earnestly advise you not 
to try. It’s too dangerous. The 
robot will not allow himself to be 
deactivated.” 

“That’s for me to decide, not 
him,” Perceveral said, and signed 
off. 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



127 



SPRING passed on Theta, and 
^ Perceveral learned how to 
live with his robot. He ordered 
him to scout a distant mountain 
range, but the robot refused to 
leave him. He tried giving him 
no orders, but the black monster 
wouldn’t stay idle. If no work was 
assigned, the robot assigned work 
to himself, suddenly bursting into 
action and creating havoc in Per- 
ceveral’s field and sheds. 

In self-defense, Perceveral gave 
him the most harmless task he 
could think of. He ordered the ro- 
bot to dig a well, hoping he would 
bury himself in it. But, grimy and 
triumphant, the robot emerged 
every evening and entered the 
cabin, showering dirt into Percev- 
eral’s food, transmitting allergies, 
and breaking dishware and win- 
dows. 

Grimly, Perceveral accepted the 
status quo. The robot now seemed 
the embodiment of that other, 
darker side of himself, the inept 
and accident-prone Perceveral. 
Watching the robot on his destruc- 
tive rounds, he felt as though he 
were watching a misshapen por- 
tion of himself, a sickness cast 
into solid, living form. 

He tried to shake free of this 
fantasy. But more and more the 
robot came to represent his own 
destructive urges cut loose from 
the life impulse and allowed to 
run rampant. 

Perceveral worked, and his neu- 



rosis stalked . behind him, eternal- 
ly destructive, yet — in the man- 
ner of neuroses — protective of 
itself. His self-perpetuating malady 
lived with him, watched him while 
he ate and stayed close while he 
slept. 

Perceveral did his work and be- 
came increasingly competent at 
it. He took what enjoyment he 
could from the days, regretted the 
setting of the sun, and lived 
through the horror of the nights 
when the robot stood beside his 
bed and seemed to wonder if now 
were the time for a summing-up. 
And in the morning, still alive, 
Perceveral tried to think of ways 
of disposing of his staggering, lurch- 
ing, destructive neurosis. 

But the deadlock remained un- 
til a new factor appeared to com- 
plicate matters. 

I T had rained heavily for sev- 
eral days. When the weather 
cleared, Perceveral walked out to 
his fields. The robot lumbered be- 
hind him, carrying the farming 
tools. 

Suddenly a crack appeared in 
the moist ground under his feet. 
It widened, and the whole sec- 
tion he was standing on collapsed. 
Perceveral leaped for firm ground. 
He made it to the slope, and the 
robot pulled him up the rest of the 
way, almost yanking his arm from 
his socket. 

When he examined the col- 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lapsed section of field, he saw that 
a tunnel had run under it. Dig- 
ging marks were still visible. One 
side was blocked by the fall. On 
the other side, the tunnel continued 
deep into the ground. 

Perceveral went back for his 
beamer and his flashlight. He 
climbed down one side of the hole 
and flashed his light into the tun- 
nel. He saw a great furry shape re- 
treat hastily around a bend. It 
looked like a giant mole. 

At last he had met another spe- 
cies of life on Theta. 

For the next few days, he cau- 
tiously probed the tunnels. Several 
times he glimpsed gray molelike 
shapes, but they fled from him into 
a labyrinth of passageways. 

He changed his tactics. He went 
only a few hundred feet into the 
main tunnel and left a gift of fruit. 
When he returned the next day, 
the fruit was gone. In its place 
were two lumps of lead. 

The exchange of gifts continued 
for a week. Then, one day when 
Perceveral was bringing more 
fruit and berries, a giant mole ap- 
peared, approaching slowly and 
with evident nervousness. He mo- 
tioned at Perceveral’s flashlight, 
and Perceveral covered the lens 
so that it wouldn’t hurt the mole’s 
eyes. 

He waited. The mole advanced 
slowly on two legs, his nose wrin- 
kling, his small wrinkled hands 
clasped to his chest. He stopped 



and looked at Perceveral with 
bulging eyes. Then he bent down 
and scratched a symbol in the dirt 
of the passageway. 

Perceveral had no idea what the 
symbol meant. But the act itself 
implied language, intelligence and 
a grasp of abstractions. He 
scratched a symbol beside the 
mole’s, to imply the same things. 

An act of communication be- 
tween alien races had begun. The 
robot stood behind Perceveral, his 
eyecells glowing, watching while 
the man and the mole searched for 
something in common. 

i^ONTACT meant more labor 
^ for Perceveral. The fields and 
gardens still had to be tended, 
the repairs on equipment made 
and the robot watched; in his spare 
time, Perceveral worked hard to 
learn the mole’s language. And the 
moles worked equally hard to 
teach him. 

Perceveral and the moles slow- 
ly grew to understand each other, 
to enjoy each other’s company, 
to become friends. Perceveral 
learned about their daily lives, 
their abhorrence of the light, their 
journeys through the underground 
caverns, their quest for knowledge 
and enlightenment. And he taught 
them what he could about Man. 

“But what is the metal thing?” 
the moles wanted to know. 

“A servant of Man,” Percev- 
eral told them. 



THE MINIMUM MAN

“But it stands behind you and 
glares. It hates you, the metal 
thing. Do all metal things hate 
men?” 

“Certainly not,” Perceveral said. 
“This is a special case.” 

“It frightens us. Do all metal 
things frighten?” 

“Some do. Not all.” 

“And it is hard to think when 
the metal thing stares at us, hard 
to understand you. Is it always like 
that with metal things?” 

“Sometimes they do interfere,” 
Perceveral admitted. “But don’t 
worry, the robot won’t hurt you.” 

r I '’HE mole people weren’t so sure. 

Perceveral made what ex- 
cuses he could for the heavy, lurch- 
ing, boorish machine, spoke of 
machinery’s service to Man and 
the graciousness of life that it 
made possible. But the mole peo- 
ple weren’t convinced and shrank 
from the robot’s dismaying pres- 
ence. 

Nevertheless, after lengthy ne- 
gotiations, Perceveral made a 
treaty with the mole people. In re- 
turn for supplies of fresh fruits 
and berries, which the moles 
coveted but could rarely obtain, 
they agreed to locate metals for 
future colonists and find sources of 
water and oil. Furthermore, the 
colonists were granted possession 
of all the surface land of Theta 
and the moles were confirmed in 
their lordship of the underground. 



This seemed an equitable dis- 
tribution to both parties, and Per- 
ceveral and the mole chief signed 
the stone document with as much 
of a flourish as an incising tool 
would allow. 

To seal the treaty, Perceveral 
gave a feast. He and the robot 
brought a great gift of assorted 
fruits and berries to the mole 
people. The gray-furred, soft-eyed 
moles clustered around, squeak- 
ing eagerly to each other. 

The robot set down his baskets 
of fruit and stepped back. He 
slipped on a patch of smooth rock, 
flailed for balance, and came 
crashing down across one of the 
moles. Immediately he regained 
his balance and tried, with his 
clumsy iron hands, to help the 
mole up. But he had broken the 
creature’s back. 

The rest of the moles fled, car- 
rying their dead companion with 
them. And Perceveral and the ro- 
bot were left alone in the tunnel, 
surrounded by great piles of fruit 

That night Perceveral thought 
long and hard. He was able to see 
the damnable logic of the event. 
Minimum-survival contacts with 
aliens should have an element of 
uncertainty, distrust, misunder- 
standing, and even a few deaths. 
His dealings with the mole people 
had gone altogether too smoothly 
for minimum requirements. 

The robot had simply corrected 
the situation and had performed 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



131 



the errors which Perceveral should 
have made on his own. 

But although he understood the 
logic of the event, he couldn’t ac- 
cept it. The mole people were his 
friends and he had betrayed them. 
There could be no more trust be- 
tween them, no hope of coopera- 
tion for future colonists. Not while 
the robot clumped and stumbled 
down the tunnels. 

Perceveral decided that the ro- 
bot must be destroyed. Once and 
for all, he determined to test his 
painfully acquired skill against the 
destructive neurosis that walked 
continually beside him. And if it 
cost his life — well, Perceveral re- 
minded himself, he had been will- 
ing to lose it less than a year ago, 
for much poorer reasons. 

XTE re-established contact with 
the moles and discussed the 
problem with them. They agreed 
to help him, for even these gentle 
people had the concept of venge- 
ance. They supplied some ideas 
which were surprisingly human, 
since the moles also possessed a 
form of warfare. They explained it 
to Perceveral and he agreed to try 
their way. 

In a week, the moles were ready. 
Perceveral loaded the robot with 
baskets of fruit and led him into 
the tunnels, as though he were at- 
tempting another treaty. 

The mole people weren’t to be 
found. Perceveral and the robot 



journeyed deeper into the passage- 
ways, their flashlights probing 
ahead into the darkness. The ro- 
bot’s eyecells glowed red and he 
towered close behind Perceveral, 
almost at his back. 

They came to an underground 
cavern. There was a faint whistle 
and Perceveral sprinted out of 
the way. 

The robot sensed danger and 
tried to follow. But he stumbled, 
thwarted by his own programmed 
ineptness, and fruit scattered 
across the cavern floor. Then ropes 
dropped from the blackness of the 
cavern’s roof and settled around 
the robot’s head and shoulders. 

He ripped at the tough fiber. 
More ropes settled around him, 
hissing in swift flight down from 
the roof. The robot’s eyecells flared 
as he ripped the cords from his 
arms. 

Mole people emerged from the 
passageways by the dozens. More 
lines snaked around the robot, 
whose joints spurted oil as he 
strained to break the strands. For 
minutes, the only sounds in the 
cavern were the hiss of flying 
ropes, the creak of the robot’s 
joints, and the dry crack of break- 
ing line. 

TJERCEVERAL ran back to 
join the fight They bound the 
robot closer and closer until his 
limbs had no room to gain a pur- 
chase. And still the ropes hissed 



132 



GA LAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



through the air until the robot 
toppled over, bound in a great 
cocoon of rope with only his head 
and feet showing. 

Then the mole people squeaked 
in triumph and tried to gouge out 
the robot’s eyes with their blunt 
digging claws. But steel shutters 
slid over the robot’s eyes. So they 
poured sand into his joints until 
Perceveral pushed them aside and 
attempted to melt the robot with 
his last beamer. 

The beamer failed before the 
metal even grew hot. They fas- 
tened ropes to the robot’s feet and 
dragged him down a passageway 
that ended in a deep chasm. They 
levered him over the side and 
listened while he bounced off the 
granite sides of the precipice, and 
cheered when he struck bottom. 

The mole people held a cele- 
bration. But Perceveral felt sick. 
He returned to his shack and lay 
in bed for two days, telling him- 
self over and over that he had not 
killed a man, or even a thinking 
being. He had simply destroyed 
a dangerous machine. 

But he couldn’t help remember- 
ing the silent companion who had 
stood with him against the birds, 
and had weeded his fields and 
gathered wood for him. Even 
though the robot had been clumsy 
and destructive, he had been clum- 
sy and destructive in Perceveral’s 
own personal way — a way that 
he, above all people, could under- 



stand and sympathize with. 

For a while, he felt as though 
a part of himself had died. But the 
mole people came to him in the 
evenings and consoled him, and 
there was work to be done in the 
fields and sheds. 

TT was autumn, time for har- 
vesting and storing his crops. 
Perceveral went to work. With the 
robot’s removal, his own chronic 
propensity for accident returned 
briefly. He fought it back with 
fresh confidence. By the first 
snows, his work of storage and 
food preservation was done. And 
his year on Theta was coming to 
an end. 

He radioed a full report to Has- 
kell on the planet’s risks, promises 
and potentialities, reported his 
treaty with the mole people, and 
recommended the planet for colon- 
ization. In two weeks, Haskell 
radioed back. 

“Good work,” he told Percev- 
eral. “The Board detided that 
Theta definitely fits our minimum- 
survival requirements. We’re send- 
ing out a colony ship at once.” 

“Then the test is over?” Per- 
ceveral asked. 

“Right. The ship should be 
there in about three months. I’ll 
probably take this batch out. My 
congratulations, Mr. Perceveral. 
You’re going to be the founding 
father of a brand-new colony!” 

Perceveral said, “Mr. Haskell, 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



133 



I don’t know how to thank you—” 

“Nothing to thank me for,” Has- 
kell said. “Quite the contrary. By 
the way, how did you make out 
with the robot?” 

“I destroyed him,” Perceveral 
said. He described the killing of 
the mole and the subsequent 
events. 

“Hmm,” Haskell said. 

“You told me there was no rule 
against it.” 

“There isn’t. The robot was part 
of your equipment, just like the 
beamers and tents and food sup- 
plies. Like them, he was also part 
of your survival problems. You 
had a right to do anything you 
could about him.” 

“Then what’s wrong?” 

“Well, I just hope you really 
destroyed him. Those quality-con- 
trol models are built to last, you 
know. They’ve got self-repair units 
and a strong sense of self-preser- 
vation. It’s damned hard to really 
knock one out.” 

“I think I succeeded,” Percev- 
eral said. 

“I hope so. It would be embar- 
rassing if the robot survived.” 

“Why? Would it come back for 
revenge?” 

“Certainly not. A robot has no 
emotions.” 

“Well?” 

“The trouble is this. The robot’s 
purpose was to cancel out any 
gains you made in survival-quality. 
It did, in various destructive ways.” 



“Sure. So, if it comes back, I’ll 
have to go through the whole busi- 
ness again.” 

“More. You’ve been separated 
from the robot for a few months 
now. If it’s still functioning, it’s 
been accumulating a backlog of 
accidents for you. All the destruc- 
tive duties that it should have per- 
formed during those months — 
they’ll all have to be discharged 
before the robot can return to 
normal duties. See what I mean?” 

■pERCEVERAL cleared his 
throat nervously. “And of 
course he would discharge them as 
quickly as possible in order to get 
back to regular operation.” 

“Of course. Now look, the ship 
will be there in about three months. 
That’s the quickest we can make 
it. I suggest you make sure that 
robot is immobilized. We wouldn’t 
want to lose you now.” 

“No, we wouldn’t,” Perceveral 
said. “I’ll take care of it at once.” 
He equipped himself and hur- 
ried to the tunnels. The mole peo- 
ple guided him to the chasm after 
he explained the problem. Armed 
with blow torch, hacksaw, sledge 
hammer and cold chisel, Percev- 
eral began a slow descent down 
the side of the precipice. 

At the bottom, he quickly lo- 
cated the spot where the robot 
had landed. There, wedged be- 
tween two boulders, was a com- 
plete robotic arm, wrenched loose 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from the shoulder. Further on, he 
found fragments of a shattered 
eyecell. And he came across an 
empty cocoon of ripped and 
shredded rope. 

But the robot wasn’t there. 

Perceveral climbed back up the 
precipice, warned the moles and 
began to make what preparations 
he could. 

Nothing happened for twelve 
days. Then news was brought to 
him in the evening by a frightened 
mole. The robot had appeared 
again in the tunnels, stalking the 
dark passageways with a single 
eyecell glowing, expertly thread- 
ing the maze into the main branch. 

The moles had prepared for his 
coming with ropes. But the robot 
had learned. He had avoided the 
silent dropping nooses and charged 
into the mole forces. He had killed 
six moles and sent the rest into 
flight. 

Perceveral nodded briefly at the 
news, dismissed the mole and con- 
tinued working. He had set up his 
defenses in the tunnels. Now he 
had his four dead beamers dis- 
assembled on the table in front 
of him. Working without a manual, 
he was trying to interchange parts 
to produce one usable weapon. 

He worked late into the night, 
testing each component carefully 
before fitting it back into the cas- 
ing. The tiny parts seemed to float 
before his eyes and his fingers felt 
like sausages. Very carefully, work- 



ing with tweezers and a magnify- 
ing glass, he began reassembling 
the weapon. 

T HE radio suddenly blared into 
life. 

“Anton?” Haskell asked. “What 
about the robot?” 

“He’s coming,” said Perceveral. 
“I was afraid so. Now listen, I 
rushed through a priority call to 
the robot’s manufacturers. I had a 
hell of a fight with them, but I 
got their permission for you to 
deactivate the robot, and full in- 
structions on how to do it.” 
“Thanks,” Perceveral said. “Hur- 
ry up, how’s it done?” 

“You’ll need the following equip- 
ment. A power source of two hun- 
dred volts delivered at twenty-five 
amps. Can your generator handle 
that?” 

“Yes. Go on.” 

“You’ll need a bar of copper, 
some silver wire and a probe made 
of some non-conductor such as 
wood. You set the stuff up in the 
following—” 

“I’ll never have time,” Percev- 
eral said, “but tell me quickly.” 
His radio hummed loudly. 
“Haskell!” Perceveral cried. 

His radio went dead. Perceveral 
heard the sounds of breakage com- 
ing from the radio shack. Then the 
robot appeared in the doorway. 

The robot’s left arm and right 
eyecell were missing, but his self- 
repair units had sealed the dam- 



THE MINIMUM MAN

aged spots. He was colored a dull 
black now, with rust-streaks down 
his chest and flanks. 

Perceveral glanced down at the 
almost-completed beamer. He be- 
gan fitting the final pieces into 
place. 

The robot walked toward him. 

“Go cut firewood,” Perceveral 
said, in as normal a tone as he 
could manage. 

The robot stopped, turned, 
picked up the axe, hesitated, and 
started out the door. 

Perceveral fitted in the final 
component, slid the cover into 
place and began screwing it down. 

The robot dropped the axe and 
turned again, struggling with con- 
tradictory commands. Perceveral 
hoped he might fuse some cir- 
cuits in the conflict. But the robot 
made his decision and launched 
himself at Perceveral. 

Perceveral raised the beamer 
and pressed the trigger. The blast 
stopped the robot in mid-stride. 
His metallic skin began to glow a 
faint red. 

Then the beamer failed again. 

Perceveral cursed, hefted the 
heavy weapon and threw it at the 
robot’s remaining eyecell. It just 
missed, bouncing off his forehead. 

Dazed, the robot groped for 
him. Perceveral dodged his arm 
and fled from the cabin, toward 
the black mouth of the tunnel. As 
he entered, he looked back and 
saw the robot following. 



TTE walked several hundred 
yards down the tunnel. Then 
he turned on a flashlight and 
waited for the robot. 

He had thought the problem out 
carefully when he’d discovered 
that the robot had not been de- 
stroyed. 

His first idea naturally was 
flight. But the robot, traveling 
night and day, would easily over- 
take him. Nor could he dodge aim- 
lessly in and out of the maze of 
tunnels. He would have to stop 
and eat, drink and sleep. The 
robot wouldn’t have to stop for 
anything. 

Therefore he had arranged a 
series of traps in the tunnels and 
had staked everything on them. 
One of them was bound to work. 
He was sure of it. 

But even as he told himself this, 
Perceveral shivered, thinking of 
the accumulation of accidents that 
the robot had for him— the months 
of broken arms and fractured ribs, 
wrenched ankles, slashes, cuts, 
bites, infections and diseases. All 
of which the robot would hound 
him into as rapidly as possible, in 
order to get back to normal 
routine. 

He would never survive the 
robot’s backlog. His traps had to 
work! 

Soon he heard the robot’s thun- 
dering footsteps. Then the robot 
appeared, saw him, and lumbered 
forward. 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Perceveral sprinted down a tun- 
nel, then turned into a smaller tun- 
nel. The robot followed, gaining 
slightly. 

When Perceveral reached a dis- 
tinctive outcropping of rock, he 
looked back to gauge the robot’s 
position. Then he tugged a cord 
he had concealed behind the rock. 

The roof of the tunnel collapsed, 
releasing tons of dirt and rock 
over the robot. 

If the robot had continued for 
another step, he would have been 
buried. But appraising the situa- 
tion instantly, he whirled and 
leaped back. Dirt showered him, 
and small rocks bounced off his 
head and shoulders. But the main 
fall missed him. 

When the last pebble had fal- 
len, the robot climbed over the 
mound of debris and continued the 
pursuit. 

Perceveral was growing short of 
wind. He was disappointed at the 
failure of the trap. But, he re- 
minded himself, he had a better 
one ahead. The next would surely 
finish off the implacable machine. 

’ I ' HEY ran down a winding tun- 
nel lit only by occasional 
flashes from Perceveral’s flashlight. 
The robot began gaining again. 
Perceveral reached a straight 
stretch and put on a burst of speed. 

He crossed a patch of ground 
that looked exactly like any other 
patch. But as the robot thundered 



over it, the ground gave way. Per- 
ceveral had calculated it carefully. 
The trap, which held under his 
weight, yielded at once under the 
robot’s bulk. 

The robot thrashed for a hand- 
hold. Dirt trickled through his fin- 
gers and he slid into the trap that 
Perceveral had dug — a pit with 
sloping sides that came together 
like a great funnel, designed to 
keep the robot immovably wedged 
at the bottom. 

The robot, however, flung both 
his legs wide, almost at. right 
angles to his body. His joints 
creaked as his heels bit into the 
sloping sides; they sagged under 
his weight, but held. He was able 
to stop himself before reaching 
the bottom, with both legs stiffly 
outspread and pressed into the 
soft dirt. 

The robot’s hand gouged deep 
handholds in the dirt. One leg re- 
tracted and found a foothold; then 
the other. Slowly the robot ex- 
tricated himself, and Perceveral 
started running again. 

His breath came short and hard 
now and he was getting a stitch in 
his side. The robot gained more 
easily, and Perceveral had to strain 
to stay ahead. 

He had counted on those two 
traps. Now there was just one 
more left. A very good one, but 
risky to use. 

Perceveral forced himself to con- 
centrate in spite of a growing diz- 



THE MINIMUM MAN 



137 




ziness. The last trap had to be cal- 
culated carefully. He passed a 
stone marked in white and switched 
off his flashlight He began count- 
ing strides, slowing until the robot 
was directly behind him, his fin- 
gers inches from his neck. 

Eighteen — nineteen — twenty! 

On the twentieth step, Percev- 
eral flung himself head-first into 
the darkness. For seconds, he 
seemed to be floating in the air. 



Then he struck water in a flat, 
shallow dive, surfaced and waited. 

The robot had been too close 
behind to stop. There was a tre- 
mendous splash as he hit the sur- 
face of the underground lake; a 
sound of furious splashing; and, 
finally, the sound of bubbles as 
the heavy robot sank beneath the 
surface. 

When he heard that, Perceveral 
struck out for the opposite shore. 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He made it and pulled himself out 
of the icy water. For minutes, he 
lay shuddering on the slimy rocks. 
Then he forced himself to climb 
further ashore on hands and knees, 
to a cache where he had stored 
firewood, matches, whiskey, blan- 
kets and clothes. 

T'kURING the next hours, Per- 
ceveral dried himself, changed 
clothes and built a small fire. He 



ate and drank and watched the 
still surface of the underground 
lake. Days ago, he had tested with 
a hundred-foot line and had found 
no bottom. Perhaps the lake was 
bottomless. More likely it fed into 
a swift-flowing underwater river 
that would pull the robot along for 
weeks and months. Perhaps . 

He heard a faint sound in the 
water and trained his flashlight in 
its direction. The robot’s head ap- 



THE MINIMUM MAN

peared, and then his shoulders and 
torso emerged. 

The lake was very evidently not 
bottomless. The robot must have 
walked across the bottom and 
climbed the steep slope on the op- 
posite side. 

The robot began to climb the 
slimy rocks near shore. Perceveral 
wearily pulled himself to his feet 
and broke into a run. 

His last trap had failed him and 
his neurosis was closing in for the 
kill. Perceveral headed toward a 
tunnel exit. He wanted the end 
to come in sunlight 

At a jolting dog-trot, Perceveral 
led the robot out of the tunnels 
toward a steep mountain slope. 
His breath felt like fire in his 
throat and his stomach muscles 
were knotted painfully. He ran 
with his eyes half-closed, dizzy 
from fatigue. 

His traps had failed. Why hadn’t 
he realized the certainty of their 
failure earlier? The robot was part 
of himself, his own neurosis mov- 
ing to destroy him. And how can 
a man trick the trickiest part of 
himself? The right hand always 
finds out what the left hand is do- 
ing, and the cleverest of devices 
never fools the supreme fooler 
for long. 

He had gone about the thing in 
the wrong way, Perceveral thought, 
as he began to climb the mountain 
slope. The way to freedom is not 
through deception. It is . 

140 



The robot clutched at his heel, 
reminding Perceveral of the dif- 
ference between theoretical and 
practical knowledge. He pulled 
himself out of the way and bom- 
barded the robot with stones. The 
robot brushed them aside and con- 
tinued climbing. 

P ERCEVERAL cut diagonally 
across the steep rock face. 
The way to freedom, he told him- 
self, is not through deception. That 
was bound to fail. The way out is 
through change! The way out is 
through conquest, not of the robot, 
but of what the robot represented. 
Himself! 

He was feeling light-headed and 
his thoughts poured on unchecked. 
If, he insisted to himself, he could 
conquer his sense of kinship with 
the robot — then obviously the 
robot would no longer be his neu- 
rosis! It would simply be a neu- 
rosis, with no power over him. 

All he had to do was lose his 
neurosis — even for ten minutes — 
and the robot couldn’t harm him! 

All sense of fatigue left him and 
he was flooded with a supreme 
and intoxicating confidence. Bold- 
ly, he ran across a mass of jum- 
bled rocks, a perfect place for a 
twisted ankle or a broken leg. A 
year ago, even a month ago, he 
would infallibly have had an ac- 
cident. But the changed Percev- 
eral, striding like a demigod, trav- 
ersed the rocks without error. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The robot, one-armed and one- 
eyed, doggedly took the accident 
upon himself. He tripped and 
sprawled at full length across the 
sharp rocks. When he picked him- 
self up and resumed the chase, he 
was limping. 

Completely intoxicated but mi- 
nutely watchful, Perceveral came 
to a granite wall, and leaped for a 
fingerhold that was no more than 
a gray shadow above him. For a 
heart-stopping second, he dangled 
in the air. Then, as his fingers be- 
gan to slip, his foot found a hold. 
Without hesitation, he pulled him- 
self up. 

The robot followed, his dry 
joints creaking loudly. He bent a 
finger out of commission making 
the climb that Perceveral should 
have failed. 

Perceveral leaped from boulder 
to boulder. The robot came after 
him, slipping and straining, draw- 
ing near. Perceveral didn’t care. 
The thought struck him that all 
his years of accident-proneness had 
gone into the making of this mo- 
ment. The tide had turned now. 
He was at last what nature had 
intended him to be all along— 
an accident-proof man! 

The robot crawled after him 
up a dazzling surface of white 
rock. Perceveral, drunk with su- 
preme confidence, pushed boulders 
into motion and shouted to create 
an avalanche. 

The rocks began to slide, and 



above him he heard a deep rumble. 
He dodged around a boulder, 
evaded the robot’s outflung arm 
and came to a dead end. 

He was in a small, shallow cave. 
The robot loomed in front of him, 
blocking the entrance, his iron fist 
pulled back. 

Perceveral burst into laughter at 
the sight of the poor, clumsy, ac- 
cident-prone robot. Then the ro- 
bot’s fist, driven by the full force 
of his body, shot out. 

Perceveral ducked, but it wasn’t 
necessary. The clumsy robot 
missed him anyhow, by at least 
half an inch. It was just the sort 
of mistake Perceveral had ex- 
pected of the ridiculous accident- 
prone creature. 

The force of the swing carried 
the robot outward. He fought hard 
to regain his balance, poised on the 
lip of the cliff. Any normal man or 
robot would have regained it But 
not the accident-prone robot. He 
fell on his face, smashing his last 
eyecell, and began to roll. 

Perceveral leaned out to accel- 
erate the roll, then quickly 
crouched back inside the shallow 
cave. The avalanche completed the 
job for him, rolling a diminishing 
black dot down the dusty white 
mountainside and burying it un- 
der tons of stone. 

Perceveral watched it all, chuck- 
ling to himself. Then he began to 
ask himself what, exactly, he had 
been doing. 



THE MINIMUM MAN

And that was when he started 
to shake. 

jV/f ONTHS later, Perceveral 
-L” stood by the gangplank of 
the colony ship Cuchulain, watch- 
ing the colonists step down into 
Theta’s midwinter sunshine. There 
were all types and kinds. 

They had all come to Theta for 
a chance at a new life. Each of 
them was vitally important at least 
to himself, and each deserved a 
fighting chance at survival, no 
matter what his potentialities. 

And he, Anton Perceveral, had 
scouted the minimum-survival re- 
quirements on Theta for these 
people; and had, in some measure, 
given hope and promise to the 
least capable among them — the 
incompetents who also wanted to 
live. 

He turned away from the 
stream of pioneers and entered the 
ship by a rear ladder. He walked 
down a corridor and entered Has- 
kell’s cabin. 

“Well, Anton,” Haskell said, 
“how do they look to you?” 

“They seem like a nice group,” 
Perceveral said. 

“They are. Those people con- 
sider you their founding father, 
Anton. They want you here. Will 
you stay?” 

Perceveral said, “I consider 
Theta my home.” 

“Then it’s settled. I’ll just-” 

“Wait,” Perceveral said. “I’m not 



finished. I consider Theta my 
home. I want to settle here, mar- 
ry, raise kids. But not yet.” 

“Eh?” 

“I’ve grown pretty fond of ex- 
ploring,” Perceveral said. “I’d like 
to do some more of it. Maybe one 
or two more planets. Then I’ll 
settle down on Theta.” 

“I was afraid you might want 
that,” Haskell said unhappily. 
“What’s wrong with it?” 
“Nothing. But I’m afraid we 
can’t use you again as an explorer, 
Anton.” 

“Why not?” 

“You know what we need. Mini- 
mum-survival personalities for 
staking out future colonies. You 
cannot by any stretch of the imagi- 
nation be considered a minimum- 
survival personality any longer.” 
“But I’m the same man I al- 
ways was!” Perceveral said. “Oh, 
sure, I improved on the planet 
But you expected that and had 
the robot to compensate for it 
And at the end—” 

“Yes, what about that?” 

“Well, at the end I just got car- 
ried away. I think I was drunk 
or something. I can’t imagine how 
I acted that way.” 

“Still, that’s how you did act” 
“Yes. But look! Even with that, 
I barely survived the experience — 
the total experience on Theta! 
Barely! Doesn’t that prove I’m 
still a minimum-survival person- 
ality?”

TTASKELL pursed his lips and 
looked thoughtful. “Anton, 
you almost convince me. But I’m 
afraid you’re indulging in a bit 
of word-juggling. In all honesty, I 
can’t view you as minimum any 
longer. I’m afraid you’ll just have 
to put up with your lot on Theta.” 

Perceveral’s shoulders slumped. 
He nodded wearily, shook hands 
with Haskell and turned to go. 

As he turned, the edge of his 
sleeve caught Haskell’s inkstand, 
brushing it off the table. Percev- 
eral lunged to catch it and banged 
his hand against the desk. Ink 
splattered over him. He fumbled 
again, tripped over a chair, fell. 

“Anton,” Haskell asked, “was 
that an act?” 

“No,” Perceveral said. “It wasn’t, 
damn it” 

“Hmm. Interesting. Now, Anton, 
don’t raise your hopes too high, 
but maybe — I say just maybe—" 

Haskell stared hard at Percev- 
eral’s flushed face, then burst into 
laughter. 

“What a devil you are, Anton! 
You almost had me fooled. Now 
will you kindly get the hell out 
of here and join the colonists? 
They’re dedicating a statue to 
you and I think they’d like to have 
you present.” 

Shamefaced, but grinning in 
spite of it, Anton Perceveral 
walked out to meet his new 
destiny.
