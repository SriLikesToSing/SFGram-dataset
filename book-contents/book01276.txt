Secrets 
entrusted 
to a 
few 



THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man's mind , and the 
mastery of life's- problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

Let them think anything they wished of 
him and his dog. All that mattered was 
the black thought slithering of the . 

M1NDSNAKE 







By JIM HARMON 

Illustrated by RITTER 

iiwtITCH! Witch!” The cry 

W was among the walk- 
ers, but he didn’t bother to 
track it down. It was no long- 
er a fighting word to Ham- 
men. He wore it like a badge 
of honor. It tasted of brass, 
but it gleamed on him. 

A puzzled growl came from 
the Familiar at his heels. The 
dog could never understand 
how people could hate Ham- 
men. Lad, the dog, often ask- 
ed Hammen how anyone 
could possibly hate Hammen, 






and Hammen always told him 
to shut up ; he couldn’t under- 
stand — he was only a dog. 

The walk ramp was crowd- 
ed this afternoon with people 
fresh from the transmatter 
stations, eager to tell them- 
selves they were walking on 
a strange planet. Hammen 
passed among the nudists, the 
cavaliers, the zip-suiters, the 
zoot-suiters, the Ivy-coated, 
the Moss-covered, walking 
not for novelty or exercise 
but because he preferred to 
go everywhere under his own 
power. Even to the stars. 

Hale and Lora saluted him 
a few paces away from the 
entrance to the station. They 
were a beautiful blond cou- 
ple, with brightly polished 
faces. Hammen didn’t much 
like them, but he didn’t feel 
sufficiently pressed to be rude 
enough to let them become 
aware of it. 

“How goes it, kids?” he 
asked them. 

“Couldn’t be better,” Hale 
said. 

“Of course not,” Lora 
added. 

AMMEN’S slate eyes 
moved from the man to 
the woman. “Are you trou- 
bled?” 

“This isn’t the time to talk 
about it, not before you and 
Lad transmit yourself,” the 
girl said quickly. 

It wasn’t, Hammen admit- 
ted to himself. Only now that 
they had let it slip, he would 

8 



rest better knowing the whole 
truth of it. 

“Come on,” Hammen 
urged. “It’s not as if I wasn’t 
interested.” 

Hale looked at his wife. 
“Lora doesn’t like Wagner 
any more.” 

“Perdition !” said Hammen. 
“I never liked Wagner. She’s 
growing up.” 

Lora put a half-closed fist 
to her lips, and didn’t look at 
either of the men, or at the 
dog who stood with freshly 
pointed ears. 

“No,” she said softly. “I 
lost something on the last one. 
Gee, I wonder if the Mind- 
snake likes Wagner now? 
Still, it’s not as if I had stop- 
ped liking music altogether, or 
books. Not this time.” 

Hale grabbed her arm 
roughly. “You’re sure doing 
a great job of getting Ham- 
men ready for the jump.” 

Lora’s eyes clouded. “I'm 
sorry, Ham.” She looked up, 
smiled warmly, kissed her 
fingertips and placed them on 
Hammen’s lips. “Companion’s 
Code, huh?” 

He took her hand and for 
the moment liked her. “Okay, 
honey. I guess even a Witch 
squeezes in under the wire for 
that.” 

The young team was ab- 
ruptly embarrassed. “Oh, 
well, Witch,” Hale said depre- 
catingly, “what does cargo 
know, anyway?” 

Hammen laughed and 
scratched Lad’s ears. “They 

JIM HARMON 





know I’m a Witch. But it has 
its advantages. I don’t have 
to worry about Lad losing his 
taste for Wagner. A dog does 
not have that much to lose. 
If it comes to that, he’s just 
gone.” 

Lora shuddered delicately, 
the way of a watered flower. 
“How could you stand to lose 
a Companion with so little 
feeling?” 

“I’ve lost three Companions, 
and got myself and my cargo 
into port. They were only 
dogs.” 

Hale looked at him sharply. 
“But you were Companioning 
with them. It must have 
been,” he selected a word, 
“difficult for you.” 

“Don’t absorb the cargo’s 
superstitions about Witches 
and their Familiars. They 
have fogged, even dirty, 
ideas. They were just dogs to 
me. Like Lad.” 

“A DOG, that’s all he is,” 
Gordus said in a 
manner designed to explain 
the thing patiently to 
Hammen. 

“Lad is a dog.” 

“Why do you emphasize the 
point now?” Hammen de- 
manded. 

The Companion sat on a 
seat formed from a single 
S-shaped plastic surface. 
Hammen studied the bulk 
of Gordus, Coordinator of 
Transmatters, who sat hulked 
in his utility chair in the 
bubble office overhanging the 

MINDSNAKE 



City of the Sea, on the world 
of Lanole. Hammen was com- 
fortable, cooled, relaxed, 
amused by a light play of 
sensory electron music, and 
aggressively unhappy. 

Gordus sat in his great 
chair patting the hair on the 
back of his left hand with his 
right palm, as if the fist were 
a sleeping kitten. At Ham- 
men’s feet, Lad’s neck mus- 
cles quivered uneasily. 

“Your record, Hammen,” 
Gordus said at last, “is a good 
one.” 

“How could it be better? 
I've never lost one member 
of a cargo.” 

“But you have lost three 
Companions.” 

“Familiars. Dogs.” 

“But it shows weakness.” 
Hammen’s face heated. “I 
never show weakness.” 

“Not your weakness, my 
dear, dear boy,” Gordus said 
in exaggeration. “The weak- 
ness of the Witch-Familiar 
relationship, the weakness of 
Witches as Companions at all. 
Don’t take it personally.” 
Hammen leaped to his feet. 
Lad’s muzzle gleamed white. 

“Not take it personally?” 
Hammen cried. ”How else can 
I take it? You are questioning 
the worthiness of my profes- 
sion, of my way of life. You 
question the honor of many 
of my friends — my associ- 
ates. Witchery is an ancient 
profession. My grandmother 
and uncle were Witches be- 
fore me. Witches have an un- 

9 




paralleled record of service 
to Transmatters and to the 
human race. How dare you, 
sir!” 

Gordus waved a fat hand 
in front of him, laughing up 
and down the scale. “No, no, 
no. Peace, please. You have 
no need to plead so strongly 
for the cause of Witches. You 
don’t have to be a Witch, you 
know, Hammen. You’re good 
enough to be a regular, full- 
fledged Companion. The rea- 
son you get so many of your 
cargo through is that you in 
the most literal sense Com- 
panion them all. It would be 
possible for you to use a 
fellow Companion on your 
jumps instead of a Familiar.” 

H AMMEN sat down, no 
longer angry, or energet- 
ic. “No. No, it wouldn’t be 
possible for me to do that. I 
can take people on an occa- 
sional jump, for high pay. But 
I couldn’t stand the same kind 
of contact, day in, day out, 
with another human being. 
Pay doesn’t come that high.” 
Gordus gave another laugh, 
and killed it sharply. “And 
there you were a few mo- 
ments ago bragging about all 
the service Witches had been 
to the human race, and when 
we get down to it, it turns 
out you hate the human race.” 
Hammen tasted the inside 
of his dry mouth and longed 
for a way out. “I don’t hate 
it; I just can’t stand it. 
There’s a difference.” 

10 



“If you say so. But tell me, 
do you like your fellow Com- 
panions, or even your fellow 
Witches, any better than you 
do your cargo?” 

“No,” Hammen admitted. 
“Good. Then we can stop 
this foolish talk about the 
Witches’ service to mankind, 
since you don’t give a damn 
about either Witches or man- 
kind. You care only about one 
Witch; your interests are en- 
tirely self-interests. Cor- 
rect?” 

“Yes.” 

“Good. Better. Now I sup- 
pose you are not entirely 
satisfied with the benefits 
you now receive as a Witch? 
You would like more money, 
pleasure, power, prestige? 
You have ambition, greed, 
hunger, desire?” 

“Yes.” 

“Fine. I didn’t think you 
had altogether ceased to be 
human. Then I can tell you 
that the Transmitter Service 
has to perform its most im- 
portant mission, and you are 
thought to be the best man 
for it.” 

“Most important mission?” 
said Hammen. “Best man?” 
Gordus became happy. 
“Those are questions? But 
I can’t tell you the answers. 
Not yet. First, you must 
promise us the added protec- 
tion of taking a human Com- 
panion for this assignment.” 
“Why should I want to do 
that, Gordus?” 

“Because I have promised 

JIM HARMON 




that you would, and I never 
fail.” 

Hammen stood for the sec- 
ond time. “Sorry. Not a good 
enough reason for me.” 

G ORDUS’ face splintered 
into confusion. “But as 
your superior, as your coor- 
dinator, I order you to take 
a human Companion for this 
assignment.” 

“Gordus,” Hammen said, 
“you were once a Companion 
yourself.” 

“When I was younger, 
while my wife was alive.” 
“Then rescind your order 
or I’ll kill you — under the 
Code, in a duel.” 

Gordus sneered. “I have 
never been beaten.” 

“Obviously,” Hammen said. 
He didn’t point out anything 
about his own status. 

“No.” 

It was a final thing. 

“Are you armed at this 
instant?” 

The coordinator shook his 
heavy head. 

“Then I plead grievance 
and choose weapons. Ap- 
peal?” 

The other shrugged. 
“Choose.” 

Hammen was breathing 
deeply and regularly, in prep- 
aration. “Before this is 
closed, I want to remind you 
that the Law and the Code 
both state that no one can in- 
terfere in the relationship 
between a Team.” 

“Doesn’t apply,” Gordus 



said. “The act of ’97 recog- 
nized the Companionship of 
Witches, but it did not extend 
the privilege to Familiars. 
Naturally not. You are a 
Companion and I could not 
separate you from a human 
Companion, but I can order 
you to break from Lad.” 
“That isn’t just.” 

“I know. But we’re talking 
about law, not justice.” 

“Do you wish aid from 
your fellow Companion?” 
Hammen asked. 

“In later years, I have 
often wished for it, but my 
formal reply: No.” 

“Then,” Hammen said, “I 
name our weapon as the body. 
The time, this instant. I can 
kill you easily with my bare 
hands, and Lad will help with 
his teeth.” 

An eyebrow-hedged ridge 
of fat above Gordus’ left eye 
angled. “Use the dog and 
you’ll get in trouble.” 

“Not before a Companions’ 
Court. But if you so state 
your preference, I’ll only use 
my own body.” 

“Hammen, about this mat- 
ter,” the coordinator said. 
“I’ll think about it.” 

“An hour,” Hammen said, 
and turned on his heel. 

“Hammen,” Gordus called 
out. 

Hammen looked back to 
face a leveled destruction 
gun. 

“You know the Code,” 
Gordus explained. “The Chal- 
lenge wasn’t withdrawn. You 



MINDSNAKE 1 1 




struck the field. A coward 
may be killed by any weap- 
on.” 

“You are too modest,” 
Hammen told him. 

Gordus smiled and fed the 
gun to a compartment of his 
utility chair. “I only wanted 
to prove a point. I can kill 
you anytime, anywhere. No 
one can beat me. Can they? 
Can they, Hammen?” 

The sweat stung Hammen’s 
palms so hard he could almost 
taste the salt in it with his 
fingers. 

“I’ll do it.” 

“Gratitude is a part of 
honor. Yes. The Code. You 
do believe in that. But you 
haven’t asked me yet who 
your human Companion on 
the jump will be.” 

“Who?” Hammen asked. 

“As you yourself pointed, 
I still come under the Code 
myself.” 

<<¥ AGREED to take a hu- 
man Companion, but I did 
not agree to take Gordus him- 
self,” Hammen explained to 
his wristphone in the alcove 
outside the coordinator’s 
office. 

“I think it’s a terrible 
thing,” Lora said. “But why 
won’t you jump with him — 
Gordus, I mean?” 

“I hate him,” Hammen ex- 
plained. 

“Oh, sure. I guess I do too. 
I’d never thought of being 
a Companion with him. Ugh! 
Oh, Hale’s swimming in 

12 



now.” Aside: “Over here, 
darling. Ham’s calling.” 

From afar: “Who?” 

Aside : “Hammen. The 

Witch.” 

“Why didn’t you say so?” 
Into the phone: “Hi, fellow. 
What can we do to you ?” 

“You can do a lot for me.” 
“For you, huh? That comes 
high, you know. What’ll it 
be?” 

Hammen retold his story, 
and finished with, “That’s 
why I called you two. I need 
a human Companion, any- 
body other than Gordus.” 

A slithering of voice, then 
faint, but distinct, from 
Lora: “I couldn’t do it and I 
can’t let you do it. Afterward, 
whichever of us, it would be 
as if I were no better than a 
dog.” 

Hammen stared ahead of 
him at the alcove wall. 

“Ham,” Hale said, “why 
did you come to us with this? 

“You were friends of mine,” 
Hammen said. 

“No.” 

“No?” 

“We aren’t friends of yours, 
Ham,” Hale said patiently. 
“We’re just acquaintances of 
yours. We’d like to help you 
out, but not enough to split 
our team for you. Surely 
you’ve got some real friends, 
people you look better to than 
us . Hell, man, don’t you 
know what a friend is?” 
Hammen thought of it. “I 
suppose not.” 

“But there must be some- 
JIM HARMON 




one,” Hale said in embarrass- 
ment, “a woman.” 

“I know a woman Witch on 
another world. We make love 
together sometimes. But I 
know her only well enough to 
know better than to ask favors 
of her.” 

“There are lots of Witches,” 
Hale said in nervous exasper- 
ation. “One of them is bound 
to Companion with you on a 
thing like this.” 

Ham touched his fingers to 
his wrist. “I think not. No 
other Witch is going to help 
me set a precedent to put them 
out of the trade.” 

“But the Code!” Hale said 
furiously. “Surely you can 
count on your fellow Witches 
under the Code.” 

“Why? I couldn’t count on 
my fellow Companions under 
the Code,” said Hammen, and 
pressed his wristphone into 
silence. 

H AMMEN stepped from the 
alcove back into Gordus’ 
office to find a lovely golden 
woman groveling at the co- 
ordinator’s feet. The coor- 
dinator was smiling at the 
pleasure of the thing. 

“What’s this?” Hammen 
demanded. 

“Cargo,” Gordus said. 

“Is she ill?” 

“Mad.” 

• “Then she can’t be trans- 
mitted. No one could hold 
together a disintegrating per- 
sonality in transmision,” 
Hammen said. 



“It will be difficult. Un- 
precedentedly difficult. That is 
why it will take the two of us 
acting as Companions to 
bring her safely to Earth.” 
“Why is it so important 
that she get to Earth?” 

“Ask her,” Gordus sug- 
gested. 

Hammen glanced down and 
saw Lad nosing pointedly at 
the woman. Often he forgot 
that the dog was constantly 
at his side. His eyes lifted up 
to the woman. 

She had fine features, im- 
pressive blonde hair, and she 
was wrapped in a frazzled 
blanket, indigo rubbed away 
to white threads here and 
there. 

“What’s your name, wom- 
an?” Hammen asked. 

“I know what it is.” 

“Of course you do,” he said 
sharply, “but I don’t.” 

“I know you don’t.” 

“There isn’t much that you 
don’t know, is there?” 

“I know everything,” she 
confessed humbly, honey eyes 
down. 

Hammen whirled to Gordus." 
“What do they want with her 
on Earth?” 

The coordinator gestured 
eloquently. “She knows every- 
thing. Do you think they know 
everything on Earth? Don’t 
believe propaganda. There are 
things she can tell them.” 
Hammen looked again to the 
creature huddled on the floor. 
“What could she tell anyone?” 
“There, are words buried in 



MINDSNAKE 



13 




any conglomeration of letters. 
Confusion is the basis of all 
codes. There is always a ci- 
pher for any code.” 

Hammen exhaled. “Never 
mind. What do I care what 
they want with her? All right, 
I'll try to take her through. 
You don’t want me to use the 
dog?” 

“No. It won’t do.” 

“Then let me take her alone. 
I could do it this once.” 
“Negative. Besides, need I 
remind you that you have al- 
ready graciously agreed to 
take a human Companion?” 
“And,” Hammen said pon- 
derously, “I can’t get any 
Companion other than you to 
go with me.” 

“You can’t? Sad. But why 
wouldn’t I be acceptable?” 

“I hate your soul.” 

“No doubt,” Gordus sighed. 
“But I believe you said you 
hated all people.” 

“I can’t stand people, only 
some people especially do I 
hate.” 

“I see. But surely it is only 
a small difference in degree, 
not kind, between the con- 
tempt and aversion you hold 
for humanity at large and that 
which you hold for me. Surely 
that difference is too small to 
cause you to break your word, 
given under the Code.” 

“I suppose it is.” The words 
tasted bad in his mouth. 
“Very well. I’ll transmit with 
you.” 

“Of course you will,” the co- 
ordinator said smoothly. 

14 



li A RE you ready to trans- 
mit now?” 

“Of course we are.” 

Hammen stood within the 
platform diagram with Gordus 
and the woman. Beyond the 
boundaries stood the techni- 
cians, one at the control 
mosaic, the other holding to 
the neck of Lad, who suffered 
it under orders. 

“Wiggle away from the 
Mindsnake, citizens,” a tech- 
nician called. 

A native, Hammen thought. 
He had never been in trans- 
mission himself. No one who 
had ever joked about the 
Mindsnake, or rarely even 
spoke of him. 

Hammen looked around 
him, slate eyes chalking the 
outline of the diagram in 
which they stood. It was only 
a rectangle, but shouldn’t it be 
rather a pentagram? 

From the time of Aristotle, 
the populace equated science 
with magic. Wasn’t the dia- 
gram only a sign to conjure 
the demon, Spatium, to do the 
boon of transporting his serv- 
ants across the void without 
decay of time? 

No. Instantaneous trans- 
mission of matter wasn’t 
magic. It had always been a 
part of folklore as teleporta- 
tion, but just as machines had 
been made to duplicate the 
legendary feats of human 
extrasensory perception, ma- 
chines made to let men speak 
over great distances to dupli- 
cate the strange voices of 

JIM HARMON 




mystics, and machines made 
that would indeed show 
strange visions over vast ex- 
panses, science had made the 
Transmatter for null-time ob- 
ject displacement. 

Transmatters were a logical, 
progressive theoretical imple- 
mentation. If electrical im- 
pulses could recreate patterns 
first in sound, then in light, 
it followed relentlessly that 
someday some form of im- 
pulses would be found to re- 
create matter. Energy and 
matter were only different 
forms of one unity. 

Fortunately, matter dupli- 
cation had come before matter 
transmission. As the re- 
searches of Phillips establish- 
ed, an exact duplicate is not 
the original. 

A duplication of a man is 
only a duplicate, not the origi- 
nal, unless the elan vital, the 
spirit, the soul, is transmitted, 
for it cannot be duplicated. A 
duplicated man is a perfect 
robot, capable of memory and 
learning, and developing into 
a human being in time. But it 
is not a human being immedi- 
ately, and it can never become 
the original of the duplicate. 
Every human viewpoint is 
unique, arid irreplaceable. 

Duplication of matter was 
uneconomical. The power out- 
lay was too great, the equip- 
ment too costly to build and 
operate. So transportation by 
transmission was investiga- 
ted. Again, it was too expen- 
sive except for very great 

16 



distances, trips of light-years 
to worlds established over the 
generations by the spaceships 
which had reached virtual 
light-speed and could not go 
beyond it. 

P ERSONALITIES of trans- 
mittees got lost among the 
stars. 

Transmitted poets arrived 
with a dim itch for a brutal 
fight, due to some residue of 
glandular acid from a parting 
insult affecting their birth 
trauma on the new world. 

Great conductors solidified, 
hating music. 

Competent engineers were 
imported with an infantile 
urge toward lyric verse. 

And the Companions came 
into being as a profession. 

Men with will power, psi- 
onic abilities, strength of 
character. You could call it 
what you liked, depending on 
your profession, your politics, 
your religion. At any rate, 
men (and women) who could 
hold human personalities to- 
gether on the long, in- 
stantaneous voyage through 
null-space. 

But still some personalities 
drifted away. 

Or, some darkly supersti- 
tious people suggested, were 
they sucked away? 

They were. 

Personalities in transmis- 
sion were being captured by 
an intelligent entity, unimagi- 
nably vast in size, which some 
believed used the movements 

JIM HARMOlK 




of galaxies as the synapse re- 
sponses of its brain. 

It was a vast entity, but not 
a very intelligent one, due to 
the square of signal decay and 
noise over light-years. More- 
over, it was psychopathic. 
From contact with human 
minds, it had decided it was, 
or would become (it was ob- 
viously confused on the point) 
the god of the humans. 

It proposed to do this by 
eventually incorporating all 
intelligence into itself. But, 
seemingly, only intelligences 
in transmission were soft 
enough for the Mindsnake to 
get a hold on. 

The Companions were hard- 
er-shelled. 

But the Mindsnake grew 
stronger. 

And Companions began tra- 
veling with other Companions, 
as teams, to resist the Mind- 
snake. 

And there came a class of 
Companions who did not need 
the help of any other man or 
woman, but only a touchstone 
of reality, something familiar 
of Earth — the mind of a dog 
or a cat or some other animal. 
Familiars. So was born the 
Corps of Witches. 

And here, Hammen won- 
dered, was this where the 
Witches came to an end? 

He looked at the bulging 
head of Gordus. He couldn't 
see inside it. Maybe there 
would ultimately be men who 
could, but he could only con- 
tact other minds when they 

MINDSNAKE 



were taken off the level of 
matter and energy, and placed 
in null-space. Where there is 
no space, there can be no bar- 
riers. 

There was nothing but con- 
fusion in the woman's mind if 
he could touch it. NotMng but 
boredom and routine in the 
minds of the technicians. 

Hammen's eyes moved to 
the dog. He suddenly decided 
Lad looked sad. But dogs have 
human facial muscles, and it 
would be impossible between 
a man and a dog for one to 
look into the other's mind, 
while they weren't in trans- 
mission. 

Uselessly, he permitted him- 
self to wish Lad was going 
with him. ... 

The heavy shoulder muscles 
of the dog ripped him free 
from the technician's grasp 
and Lad threw himself across 
the diagram line as the co- 
ordinants of the transmatter 
phased. 

T ransmission, no time. 

No space. Hammen felt an 
overblown wave of force. 

“How's that Tor power^’ 
Gordus demanded. 

It came as yvords: to him; ;aisf 
communication between peo- 
ple had come to*him all of his 
life. Dqaf-mute Companions 
had tQld him communication 
in transmission came to them 
as hands and fingers feeling 
of words. 

“You've never had a real 
Companion before, have you?" 

17 




Gordus asked. “You’ve never 
felt real power like this be- 
fore?” 

“Power? I’ve heard mem- 
bers of the cargo scream as 
loud from terror and horror. 
We don’t scream in transmis- 
sion, Coordinator. Let the 
Snake sleep.” 

“Power,” the coordinator 
repeated. “I always held my 
cargo together with power.” 

“When you were a Com- 
panion, the Snake wasn’t as 
strong as it is now. Quiet, 
please.” 

Hammen felt out for his 
Familiar. A tail wagged some- 
where. A head cocked to one 
side in puzzlement, concern. 
What wasn’t a hand petted 
that which wasn’t a head. 

“Just us — just the two of 
us — to see after the woman,” 
Gordus said with a leer in his 
voice. 

D IDN’T he know about Lad 
crossing the diagram? 
Hadn’t he seen? 

“You sound as if you were 
about to suggest we team up 
and rape her. It’s hardly prac- 
ticable here.” 

“But that’s it, Hammen ! 
That’s it! I want to rape her 
mind !” 

“Go away, Gordus. I don’t 
believe in you. Nobody really 
makes a career out of being 
that swinish.” 

“My profession is power, 
Hammen. I find your attitude 
unprofessional.” 

Hammen reached out for 

18 



the girl. “What do you want 
from her?” 

“She knows everything, 
Hammen. Don’t you want to 
know everything?” 

“No,” Hammen said. “I’d 
never be able to remember it.” 
The girl was retreating 
from them. Had she been 
snagged by the Mindsnake? 
No. Only drift. Hammen 
threw an anchor into her, 
braced himself against his 
Familiar, and pulled. She 
came apart at the seams and 
flew off in all directions, gib- 
bering. 

He raced after all the pieces 
of the woman at a practiced, 
steady trot and gathered them 
all in. He made a rough 
boundary and compartment- 
alized her. 

For an instant, he looked 
through the jumble that was 
her mind. Sensuality, sloth, 
greed, hate, envy, pride, 
hunger, death wish — it was 
the usual human pattern well 
enough, but they were letters 
that spelled out no words. It 
would be impossible to find 
any information in that psy- 
chic junk heap. 

Deftly, Hammen turned 
Gordus back on. 

“. must know. You’ll 
have to help me, Hammen.” 
“Why must I?” 

“Simplicity. You must. We 
stay here until you do. You 
can’t close the transmission 
without me, and I will not do 
it until you help me pick the 
woman’s mind. We can wait 

JIM HARMON 




forever until you decide to do 
as I order. There is no time 
here.” 

Gordus was a blind old man 
stumbling in the dark. He 
hadn’t seen Lad join them in- 
side the diagram. He probably 
wasn’t even aware that Ham- 
men had the woman under 
tow. 

“Listen to me, Gordus. That 
about there being ‘no time’ 
here is a mathematical ab- 
straction. Practically, it has 
its limitations. There is some 
flow of some kind of duration 
here, otherwise our questions 
and answers would come at 
the same time.” 

“What are you trying to 
teach me?” Gordus demanded. 
“I was a Companion before 
you were bom.” 

“But then the Mindsnake 
wasn’t so active or so power- 
ful. If the ‘duration’ of our 
transmission is too long, he’ll 
get a clear fix on us — and that 
will be that.” 

“I’ll risk that. Will you?” 

“No,” Hamen said. “You’re 
a fool out here in transmis- 
sion. You don’t know what 
you’re doing. What do you ex- 
pect of me? 

“Link with me, Companion, 
as you should. Help me gain 
her knowledge.” 

H AMMEN knew that he was 
being asked to help gain 
access to information intend- 
ed for the Federation authori- 
ties on Earth. But he rarely 
thought of himself as a Fed- 



eral, and he knew very few 
worlds would allow extradi- 
tion of him on a Federal 
charge. At the moment, he 
was mainly concerned with 
saving himself and his cargo 
from the Mindsnake. As dis- 
tasteful as it was, Gordus was 
a part of his cargo, and a man 
had to have a few ideals. 
Gordus was not qualified to be 
a Companion after the gen- 
erations of growth of the 
Mindsnake. He was only a 
pitiful fool now. (How long 
before the Snake gets so big 
I will not be qualified? How 
long before no one is quali- 
fied? How long before the 
Snake comes out of null-space 
and stalks the planets?) 

Hammen shrugged and 
joined Gordus. 

They struck for the mind 
of the woman. 

Her name, they warned, 
Isodel. 

They found that out, and 
incredibly, more. 

In some way Gordus’ mind 
paralelled the girl’s. There 
was much of a kind about 
them, and Gordus could piece 
together the fragments of her 
identity. But then he was 
reaching down for something, 
and he prestidigitated it up 
and out of sight. 

Hammen realized that 
Gordus had succeeded in get- 
ting what he wanted and in 
keeping it from him. He was 
less of a doddering old fool 
than he appeared. 

“What was that?” Hammen 

19 



MINDSNAKE 




demanded. “What did you 
take?” 

He tried to shake it loose 
from the coordinator. 

“Let go of me !” Gordus 
cried out in immaterial in- 
dignity. 

Hammen released him. 

Completely. 

Gordus screamed sound- 
lessly as he retreated toward 
infinity. 

“Shall I catch you?” Ham- 
men asked. 

The scream changed in 
pitch. 

The Witch brought him 
back. 

“You stayed,” Gordus said. 
“Somehow you stayed. That 
dog. Somehow you’ve got your 
damned Familiar with you, 
haven’t you, Witch?” 

“No,” Hammen lied fluent- 
ly. “Only feeble minds like 
yours require a contact. Shall 
I tell you something about 
Witches? The Familiars are 
a deception. We don’t need 
them at all. We are lone 
wolves.” 

“Wolves, are you? So now 
I know what your grand- 
mother before you was.” 

Hammen laughed. 

And sobered. 

“What did you take, 
Gordus?” he demanded. 

“What do you know about 
her?” asked Gordus. 

“Her name is Isodel.” 

“Isodel Van Der Lies.” 

“I’ve heard of her. Some- 
where,” Hammen said hesi- 
tantly. 

20 



« A GREAT theoretician,” 
-f®- the coordinator explain- 
ed sullenly. “Probably the first 
authentic female genius of the 
race of man. On a par with 
Plato, Shakespeare, Newton, 
Einstein.” 

“What theory of hers were 
you after?” Hammen pursued. 

“A method of destroying the 
Mindsnake.” 

“You want to take the 
credit from her.” 

“I want only to take the 
theory from her, Hammen.” 

“You mean you don’t want 
the Mindsnake to be destroy- 
ed. You are afraid its destruc- 
tion would mean the end of 
the Companion Corps which 
you head.” 

“Not at all. I only want the 
theory so I can reverse it. 
Once you know how to destroy 
the Mindsnake, you also know 
how to create one. You see, 
I intend to become another 
Mindsnake, one who knows 
too much of destruction to 
ever be destroyed.” 

“Listen carefully, Gordus,” 
Hamen said with infinite care. 
“You’re ill. You don’t know 
what you’re talking about. It 
can’t be done.” 

“The ultimate dream — ulti- 
mate power.” 

“That’s pure psychosis, 
Gordus!” 

“Is it? Watch how easily I 
begin to grow. I have the 
woman’s mind now.” 

It was true. 

The pooh, mad genius wo- 
man was gone. 



JIM HARMON 




“Stop it, Coordinator. You 
don’t know what you’re do- 
ing!” 

Hammen tried to reach him. 

“That’s it, that’s it. Come 
ahead, my boy. I’m becoming 
a Mindsnake. Now I am a 
Mindsnake. Come ahead. Let, 
me swallow you next.” 

“You fool,” Hammen broad- 
cast. “You are the Mindsnake 
now. Don’t you think anyone’s 
ever wanted power before? 
Won’t you let yourself remem- 
ber how it was when you were 
a Companion? This is how it 
alivays happens. You’ve let 
yourself be swallowed by the 
Snake. You ran right into its 
jaws.” 

“No.” Gordus thought furi- 
ously. “I—” 

And the Snake digested the 
tiny egg in its gullet and “I” 
blurred and was washed over 
by “All.” 

Hammen struck at it in 
anger and humiliation and 
terror and it retreated with 
frictionless speed. 

The Snake took something 
with it. 

It took Gordus, and it left 
that part of the woman, Iso- 
del, that he had been able to 
capture. But the part of Iso- 
del matched by Gordus’ mind 
was jerked free. 

She was freed of hate, an- 
ger, lust . 

She was left an impossibly 
ideal woman — all Mother, Sis- 
ter, Lover . 

Against his will, by im- 
mutable laws of nature, Ham- 



men fell monstrously in love 
with her. 

H AMMEN was among the 
first of Companions or 
Witches to join the Suicide 
Squadron. 

He did it to protect Isodel 
and her descendants for all 
time to come, and he did it in 
impotent fury at his reason 
for doing it. 

The Companions transmit- 
ted in droves to abolish 
their profession. They trans- 
mitted against the Mind- 
snake. 

The Federation on Earth 
had made use of Isodel’s the- 
ories. They were only a for- 
mal mathematical statement 
of what had always been 
known — destruction reaches 
a critical mass and destroys 
itself by turning against it- 
self. 

Where Hammen had refus- 
ed to join one human mind, 
he joined countless ones in a 
huge drive against the Snake. 

They became one with each 
other and they became one 
with the Snake, and the Snake 
turned on itself and destroyed 
itself and them, and they 
turned on themselves — and 
stopped. 

They hung together for 
an unmeasurable time — and 
broke apart. 

They were a super-entity 
like the Snake. But where the 
Snake had been mad, they 
were sane. 

They drifted through the 



MINDSNAKE 21 




haze of twilight and -broke 
apart, their hands gliding 
away into the shadows. 

Hammen was gloriously 
happy. He had never been 
happy before and he was not 
at all sure he liked it. 

“Jobs are so hard to find 
these days,” Isodel said, her 
lovely face brightly sane. 
“What will you take up, dar- 
ling?” 

“There’s still need for Com- 
panions — and Witches,” he 
explained. “There seems more 
of a tendency for members of 
the cargo to drift away than 
ever. The Mindsnake at least 
gave them something to re- 
sist, a foothold of friction. 
Now there is nothing — noth- 
ing to do but drift, drift, 
drift. People in transmission 
will need Companions for a 
long time to come.” 

“I need a Companion,” 
lovely Isodel said. 

His heart leaped ridicu- 
lously. 

“But not a Witch,” said 
gorgeous Isodel. 

Pain, very great physical 
pain. 

“I love you,” priceless Iso- 
del went on. “How could I 
help it? I am a woman and I 
love the father image. You 
are my father — symbolically, 
fortunately, not biologically. 
You held the sane part of me 
while Gordus dragged off the 
unsane part. You gave me — 
this me — birth. I love you. 
But I don’t love your dog.” 

“My dog?” said Hammen. 



“No woman can marry a 
man and his dog.” 

“I see,” said Hammen, see- 
ing it all, and living. 

Y OU could see everything 
about yourself and live. It 
wasn’t easy, but you could do 
it. Especially if you had the 
training and experience of be- 
ing a Companion. Or a Witch. 

“It would kill Lad to sepa- 
rate him from me for long, 
you know,” Hammen said. 

Isodel’s beautiful eyes mist- 
ed. And she said in all her in- 
furiating gentleness, “Then 
it is impossible for us, if we 
have to destroy a living — ” 
“He’s just a dog,” he point- 
ed out. “I would wring his 
neck cheerfully if it would do 
any good. But it wouldn’t.” 
Isodel looked sad, and 
brave, and wonderful. 

“Don’t you see, Isodel? It’s 
impossible for me to do the 
right thing. If it wasn’t Lad, 
it would be another dog, and 
if it wasn’t a Familiar to 
make me a Witch, it would 
be something else to make me 
different, because I am differ- 
ent. I have to live with that. 
Among the right people, I am 
the left man.” 

So he left her, and walked 
out of the Floating Gardens 
onto the walkway and Lad fell 
in at his side, and he listened 
without anger to the hush- 
ings and keenings of the 
crowd. 

“Witch! Witch!”

SUPERJOEMULLOY 



By SCOTT F. GRENVILLE 

Illustrated by WOOD 



J OE MULLOY lounged in the floor, there were mirrors. Joe 
plushest chair in his luxuri- sneered at the place where the 
ous office. All around him, on mirrors were most profuse; 
the walls, on the ceiling, even twenty or thirty perfectly iden- 
in strategic spots all over the tical Joes sneered back at him. 





He admired his sneer from 
every angle, shaping and 
changing the contemptuous 
look on his face with his hands, 
stroking it f much as other 
young men in a far earlier age 
had stroked and twisted their 
fine mustachios. 

As usual, Joe Mulloy was 
engrossed in his two favorite 
hobbies: narcissism and indo- 
lence. 

Joe’s friends, of which there 
were very few, could have 
given you a fairly accurate re- 
sume of his character in five 
words, his sneer and his indo- 
lence. * 

In the first respect they 
would have been right. Joseph 
Mulloy had been bom with a 
sneer on his face. His whole 
early life had been centered 
around that sneer. It had en- 
raged his father, distressed his 
mother, driven his teachers to 
tears, his playmates to tan- 
trums. He stopped doing home- 
work at the age of eight, but 
the teachers passed him on any- 
way to avoid complete mental 
breakdown. 

Gradually, Joe Mulloy began 
to get his way in everything by 
virtue of his sneer. It was not 
merely openly supercilious ; 
that was the beauty of it. It 
was so subtle, so faint, and yet 
such an open avowal of con- 
tempt for the entire human 
race, that try as the people he 
tormented would, to find some- 
thing in his sneer to charge 
him with, they never found 
anything. 

24 



In a very few years, regis- 
tration day at Joe’s elementary 
school became a game of Rus- 
sian Roulette, having as the 
loaded chamber the question: 
“Who’s going to get little Joey 
Mulloy in his class this year?” 
Finally, when Joe Mulloy was 
fifteen years old, the local 
Board of Education wisely de- 
cided to end Joe’s formal edu- 
cation, rather than make 
screaming meemies an occupa- 
tional disease at the local high 
school. 

Joe’s father welcomed the 
expelling as an excuse to beat 
him to a pulp and kick him out 
of the house. It was not until 
three days later that the mem- 
ory of Joe’s sneer, enduring 
through all the punishment he 
had received, made the father 
blow his brains out with the 
most accurate German Luger 
he could buy at the pawn shop 
on short notice. 

But Joe’s friends would have 
been wrong in the second in- 
stance, for Joseph Mulloy was 
not chronically indolent. In his 
own profesion, Joe Mulloy was 
the most industrious man 
imaginable. For Joe Mulloy 
was a robot builder. 

D isinherited by his fa- 
ther, he had made a beeline 
for the nearest positronics lab- 
oratory. The personnel man- 
ager had flatly refused him the 
job when he had told her he 
had absolutely no qualifica- 
tions, but she was so discon- 
certed by his persistent sneer 

SCOTT F. GRENVILLE 




that she had to give him the 
job just to get him out of her 
sight. 

Once in the laboratory, he 
had gone right to work learn- 
ing everything there was to 
know about robots, scorning all 
help from the other techni- 
cians. Since he held other sci- 
entists, past or present, in an 
ineffable contempt, he had to 
learn everything by experience 
instead of studying what his 
merely human predecessors 
had done. He was so empirical 
that he learned all about alter- 
nating current by deliberately 
sticking a wet finger in a light 
socket again and again. 

He made mistakes at first, of 
course. In fact, he ruined sev- 
eral thousand dollars’ worth of 
laboratory equipment during 
his apprenticeship. But his 
amazing sneer conquered all, 
and he was soon recognized as 
the most brilliant — and the 
most conceited — man in the 
field of positronics. 

Now Joe Mulloy was loung- 
ing in a plush office chair, cul- 
tivating to near perfection his 
already mature sneer, and 
suddenly feeling maddeningly 
thirsty. 

“Robot !" he said. 

A startlingly human-looking 
robot seemed to materialize in- 
stantaneously from nowhere. 

“How might thy humble 
servant serve thee, 0 magnifi- 
cent Master?” it inquired, bow- 
ing so low that its partially 
metallic nose scratched the rich 
mahogany floor. 

SUPERJOEMULLOY 



“What took you so long, you 
damned fool?” asked Joe. 

“I apologize, Gracious Mas- 
ter. I am incompetent and 
worthless.” 

“Get me a drink, you bucket 
of bolts,” said Joe. 

“I am grateful for a chance 
to serve thee, Benevolent Mas- 
ter,” replied the robot in its 
monotonous Uncle Tom patter, 
and made another floor- 
scratching bow. Then it grovel- 
ed out of the room. 

“That robot is getting too 
slavelike,” said Joe to himself, 
after the robot had left. “All 
my robots seem to be that way. 
They do exactly what I tell 
them to, and degrade them- 
selves sickeningly before me. 
All the people I’ve ever known 
seem to be that way, too. I wish 
I could find at least one mind 
equal to mine to clash with. 
Then I could have a real fight 
for once. None of this bowing 
and scraping.” 

Just then the robot entered 
with a Manhattan, made its 
usual floor-gouging bow, and 
scraped its metal feet to get 
Joe’s attention. Joe turned to 
glare at the mechanical minion. 

“Robot!” 

“Yes, Omnipotent Mas — ” 
the robot began, but Joe cut it 
off. 

“Get over to the laboratory 
and blow yourself up ! And find 
an empty comer, where you 
won’t do too much damage.” 

“Master, I am happy for the 
chance to give my life — ” 

“Never mind that, you glori- 

25 




fied Erector set! Do as I say!” 
"Yes, Master.” The robot 
hazarded a slight bow, but for- 
got to crawl out of the room 
on its hands and knees in its 
eagerness to follow its master’s 
orders. 

J OE MULLOY leaped to his 
feet. In the moment of his 
excitement, he forgot that mel- 
odrama is a human weakness, 
and he became melodramatic 
himself. Even his incorruptible 
sneer faded slightly as his ex- 
citement grew. 

“I must find someone with a 
mind equal or superior to 
mine,” he told himself. “Now 
who has a mind equal to mine? 
Obviously no one but me. 
Therefore I must find someone 
with a mind superior to mine. 
Now who is superior to me?” 
For the first time in his life, 
Joe Mulloy was confronted by 
what seemed an unanswerable 
question. 

Joe’s train of thought was 
interrupted by a deafening ex- 
plosion from the laboratory, as 
his latest robot jubilantly com- 
mitted suicide. The building 
shook violently for a few sec- 
onds, then subsided. 

To his great surprise, he 
was able to answer his ques- 
tion. 

“Of course! Since the only 
thing equal to me is me, the 
only thing superior to me 
would be a super-me, a super- 
ego! I’ll build a super-robot, 
with all my magnificent quali- 
ties, only magnified a thousand 

26 



times! I’ll build a Super Joe 
Mulloy!” 

He ran the letters together 
to make it one word : 

Super joemulloy. 

He dashed up to his labora- 
tory, cleaned up the mess his 
overeager robot had made in 
killing itself, and went fever- 
ishly to work on his new proj- 
ect, learning the necessary 
techniques by experience, of 
course, and applying them to 
his super-robot. He made some 
mistakes at first, of course. But 
in three weeks and six days, 
Super joemulloy was ready for 
its debut in robot society. 

Not one to miss a chance to 
impress mere humans with his 
genius, Joe invited the world’s 
greatest positronics experts to 
the unveiling of Super joemul- 
loy. There was a tense air of 
excitement as Joe pulled the 
lever that removed the big 
black curtain in front of the 
robot and started the activa- 
tion machine. 

When they saw Superjoe- 
mulloy, the experts gasped 
with envy. It was impossible 
to tell the super-robot from a 
human. Its limbs, torso, and 
head were so well proportion- 
ed, and done in such fine detail, 
that anyone in the room not in 
the know would have sworn 
that it was a human being. 
There were even fingerprints 
delicately cut into the super- 
robot's artificial hands. And 
Super joemulloy looked exactly 
like Joe Mulloy, except for the 
sneer. It was twenty times bet- 

SCOTT F. GRENVILLE 




ter even than Joe’s own. It was 
a super-sneer. 

But although the activation 
machine was working its hard- 
est, nothing happened. The 
super-robot refused to move 
one solitary mechanical muscle. 
Joe’s guests began to file out, 
once the novelty of the robot 
had passed. Joe left the room 
in disgust and went downstairs 
for a drink. 

W HEN he returned to the 
laboratory, Super joemul- 
loy was on its feet, examining 
the laboratory equipment with 
obvious disgust. In the preced- 
ing few minutes, the super- 
robot’s super-sneer had grown 
more perfect, and the robot 
was fast becoming the very 
personification of contempt. 

“Why didn’t you move 
around when my friends were 
here, you heap of junk?” Joe 
asked the super-robot. 

Super joemulloy turned to 
him. “I didn’t want to display 
my perfection before mere hu- 
mans, you distorted blob of 
protoplasm,” it said. 

Joe Mulloy was becoming an- 
gry, but he tried not to show it. 
He downed his drink. 

“Get me another,” he told 
the robot, holding out his glass. 

“The hell with you,” said 
Super joemulloy. “What do you 
think you are, God or some- 
thing? Just because you slap- 
ped me together with your 
clumsy butterfingers doesn’t 
give you the right to order me 
around like some common serv- 



ant. Now that you’ve created 
me, I could do a better job of 
robot-building myself. Now get 
the hell out of here.” 

Joe Mulloy turned on his heel 
and stomped out of the room. 
No robot was going to talk to 
him like that! No, sir! 

The super-robot quietly fol- 
lowed Joe to the door and gave 
him a kick that sent him 
sprawling down the stairs. At 
the bottom of the staircase, Joe 
whacked his face against the 
solid oak of the banister. He 
turned groggily to look at the 
blurred image of the robot 
standing defiantly at the top of 
the steps, with its hands on its 
hips. For a brief second the 
sneer faded from Super joemql- 
lojds face, and was replaced by 
an evil sadistic leer. 

Joe Mulloy recalled the last 
line of Father William: “Now 
be off, or I’ll kick you down 
stairs.” But the super-robot 
was far worse than Father 
William. A conceited, con- 
temptuous monster, it was to- 
tally unlike Joe’s warm, hum- 
ble, self-effacing self! The 
sneering monster must be de- 
stroyed! . 

Joe cunningly enticed the 
robot to leave the laboratory 
for Joe’s office, where it could 
admire its sneer in all the mir- 
rors. Sneeringly Joe wondered 
why anyone could admire a 
sneer so much. Without think- 
ing, he used his hand to smooth 
out the wrinkles in his now 
slightly worn sneer. Then he 
crept upstairs to his laboratory 

27 



SUPERJOEMULLOY 




to barricade himself in there to 
think of a way to destroy 
Super j oemulloy. 

At last he hit on the answer. 
A hypnosis machine. 

“The robot is mechanical, so 
I’ll have to hypnotize him by 
mechanical means,” Joe rea- 
soned to himself. 

He worked day and night, 
learning the necessary tech- 
niques as he went along. He 
made some mistakes at first, of 
course. But in four days the 
mechanical hypnosis machine 
was complete. 

Joe found the super-robot in 
the mirror-lined office, where 
it had been admiring and im- 
proving its sneer for the last 
four days. The sneer was mag- 
nificent. But it still lay just one 
iota short of absolute perfec- 
tion. Try as the robot would, 
perfection in a sneer still lay 
without its grasp. 

“Genius!” shouted Joe, to 
get the robot to turn its head. 
He turned the dial on the me- 
chanical hypnosis instrument 
up to full power. “You are now 
in my power!” 

But now Super joemulloy’s 
sneer was completely perfect. 
With a look of sublime con- 
tempt on its plastic face, it 
took the hypnosis machine, 
turned it around, and aimed it 
right back at Joe Mulloy. 



J OE MULLOY bowed so low 
that he skinned his nose on 
the rich mahogany floor. “Yes, 
Master?” he said. 

“Bring me a drink, you blot 
of living tissue!” said Super- 
joemulloy. 

Joe Mulloy made another 
nose-skinning bow and grovel- 
ed out of the room. 

“This human is getting too 
slavelike,” said Super j oemul- 
loy to himself. “I suppose I 
could rebuild him, though.” 

Joe returned almost instant- 
ly with a Manhattan, made his 
usual nose-damaging bow, and 
scraped his leather shoes to get 
Super joemulloy’s attention. 

The super-robot turned and 
glared at him. “Human !” 

“Yes, Master?” 

“Get up on that slab in the 
comer.” 

Joe Mulloy obeyed. 

With all the skill of an expe- 
rienced human-builder, Super- 
j oemulloy began to take Joe’s 
body apart. Joe screamed, but 
the super-robot ordered him — 
by hypnotic command — to shut 
up, and Joe obeyed. 

Super j oemulloy began to put 
together a Supersuperj oemul- 
loy out of what had once been 
Joe Mulloy. 

He made some mistakes at 
first, of course.

Mercy 

By DANIEL KEYES 

Illustrated by WOOD 




I N HIS dream, he screamed 
and fought them off and 
begged them not to take him. 
He saw them slipping up 
silently in the night and tak- 
ing him down to the long 
black service- jet waiting in 
the street below. 

He opened his eyes quickly 
and reassured himself that he 
was still in his own room. 
The sheets and his pillow were 
damp with his sweat, as they 
were every morning now 
since his sickness had become 
worse. A glance at the latticed 
window, where the sky show- 
ed through like strips of gray 
felt, told him that it was too 
early to get up. They had not 
come for him tonight. 

He fought back the urge to 
reach over his head for a dor- 
caine tablet from the dispens- 
er. Just a touch of his signet 
ring to the dispenser plate 
and he would have the pain- 
soothing drug — enough to cool 
his feverish body and give 
him rest. He would wait. Il- 
legally, for over three months 
now, he’d restricted the use of 
dorcaine — the drug that the 
law required him to take at 
the first sign of severe physi- 
cal discomfort. 

He could hold out a little 
longer, telling himself over 
and over that every symptom 
he could diminish or hide or 
control for a while gave them 
that much less data to go on, 
that much less of an upward 
curve on their graphs, inter- 
fering — however slightly — 

31 




with that final, irrevocable 
diagnosis. 

It was worth the suffering 
if it delayed for one day their 
awareness of his disease. It 
would be that much longer 
before the Service and Repair 
Center could send a servo 
crew down to investigate. He 
would have just that much 
longer to live. 

Lying awake, he stared at 
the ceiling, wondering how 
successful his desperate de- 
ception had been. Although 
they might be temporarily 
thrown off by the false dor- 
caine average on his records, 
he knew too well that the 
Dispatcher could not be side- 
tracked for long. And when 
the secret was out — what 
then? Would there be a front- 
page scandal when it was dis- 
covered that Paul Dorn, the 
head of the Maintenance Divi- 
sion of Service and Repair, 
was a waster? 

He couldn’t push the foul 
word from his mind. Waster. 
Yes, he felt ashamed — but as 
long as he was able to conceal 
it, he would hang on to life. 

T HE Service and Repair 
Center was a long arc of 
tall white buildings on the 
outskirts of New Virginia, 
not far from where the an- 
cient Capitol Ruins stood. As 
his copter approached the 
area, Paul Dorn identified 
himself to the Dispatcher- 
plate with his signet ring. The 
electronic brain accepted his 

32 



signal and freed the beam 
that would guide him, auto- 
controlled, into his port atop 
the Maintenance Building of 
the Center. 

As he landed, he noticed 
that a detail of servos was 
hauling away the wreckage 
of a black-and-orange copter 
that looked for all the world 
like a giant, crushed butter- 
fly. Calling out to the leader 
of the servo-detail, he asked 
what had happened. 

“An unauthorized ship,” 
said the servo, “tried to land 
without clearance from the 
Dispatcher.” 

Paul Dorn was still think- 
ing about it down in his lab 
when the call came over the 
loudspeaker. He was asked to 
come down to the Records Di- 
vision right away. Chief Abel 
Jennings wanted to see him. 

At Records, the Chief was 
talking with someone on the 
TV line, and he waved for 
Paul to have a seat. The 
Chief, sixty and well tanned, 
had a huge, lumpy face that 
always reminded Paul of a 
potato. 

Flipping the switch off, the 
Chief leaned back in his chair 
to study Paul. “There’s been 
an accident.” 

“I know. I saw them clear- 
ing away the mess before I 
came in. Some fool trying to 
cheat the Mercy Vault?” 

The potato eyes bulged 
wide. “That’s not funny!” 

“No, you’re right. I’m 
sorry. Is he alive?” 



DANIEL KEYES 




“They’ve got him down in 
the Examination Ward right 
now. Paul, it’s your brother.” 
Paul had started to light a 
cigarette and his hand froze 
in mid-air. “Victor — tried to 
land — without a clearance 
beam?” 

The Chief nodded. “They 
called me first because he used 
to work in my department. 
Made a wreck of himself. 
From what they say, Spare 
Parts might have been able 
to provide replacements for 
most of his damaged organs 
and a new right leg. But — ” 
“What else?” 

“His left arm — up to the 
shoulder — his kidneys, and 
his left eye.” 

P AUL nodded slowly and 
let his hand drop to the 
arm-rest of his chair. The 
headstrong kid. He had heard 
that Victor’s left arm and kid- 
neys had already been re- 
placed after the accident last 
month in a public tube. Both 
his eyes were also “seconds” 
— the originals had been lost 
in a childhood accident. Paul 
knew too well the bio-physical 
law : one replacement of a 
part to a customer. The nerve 
freezing process for the re- 
synthesis of nerve cells could 
be done only once and never 
again. 

“There just wasn’t enough 
left to patch up,” growled the 
big man. He put his hand on 
Paul’s shoulder. “How long 
since you last spoke to him?” 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



“Not since you fired him, 
seven months ago. We had a 
quarrel about his hanging 
around with those A-D people. 
I called him some nasty 
names. I even blamed him for 
the blast in the Dispatcher’s 
Vault that nearly finished the 
two of us. He was always a 
sensitive kid, and his feelings 
were hurt. I haven’t seen him 
s i n ce. M 

“Paul,” said the Chief, look- 
ing down at his desk, “you 
knew, when you recommended 
Victor for a job here, that he 
was Anti-Dispatcher.” 

“When he was in college. I 
had no idea he was still hang- 
ing around with those A-D 
people — ” 

The Chief’s fist came down 
on the desk. “And yet you put 
me on the spot. I pressured 
through his application be- 
cause you asked me to. If I’d 
had a hint about such ideas 
and past associations, I’d nev- 
er have given him a job in 
Records — even if he was Isaac 
Dorn’s son. Your father’s 
name got Victor off at the 
hearing, but to me a man is 
what he is, not what his an- 
cestors were — and for my 
money that blast was no ac- 
cident. It gives me the shakes 
sometimes when I think that 
just six feet closer to the 
synchro-computer and — ” 

“Hold on, Chief. You’re 
making some pretty big judg- 
ments.” 

“Am I ? Are you forgetting 
what it cost you 1” 



33 




"Me?” Paul was shocked 
for a moment, until he real- 
ized what the Chief was re- 
ferring to. “Oh, you mean 
this — ” Paul held up his right 
hand, opening and clenching 
the fingers as if they were 
still strange to him. “My first 
replacement. A little thinner 
than my left one, and the 
knuckles are a little sharper, 
but otherwise it wasn’t a bad 
match.” He paused. “You 
know, I find myself wonder- 
ing what the guy was like who 
owned it before he was do- 
nated to the Center.” 

“Don’t be morbid, Paul. It 
could have been a lot worse 
than a replaced hand and only 
a touch of radiation.” 

The Chief reminded him 
that in the old days — before 
Isaac Dorn had revolutionized 
things — when they still had 
humans standing watch in the 
Vaults instead of servos, there 
were men who had picked up 
incurable cases of radiation- 
cancer. Paul, the Chief said, 
had the Dispatcher to thank 
for being alive and healthy. 

“And no thanks to your ac- 
cident-prone brother that 
you’re still here,” concluded 
the Chief. “You could have 
done lots worse.” 

That's hoiv much you knoio. 
That’s how much anyone 
knows . 

The Chief outlined quickly 
what he wanted Paul to do: 
“Visit your brother in the Ex- 
amination Ward before they 
send him home for the funer- 

34 



al. There have been reports 
about the Dispatcher making 
mistakes and the A-D move- 
ment using them to discredit 
the Center. Find out what he 
knows. But most important, I 
want to know when and how 
they’re going to try to sabo- 
tage the synchro-computer 
that your father built — ” 
“Sabotage?” 

The Chief nodded. Security 
police had learned from in- 
formants that the A-Ds had 
developed an underground 
striking force of partisans de- 
termined to cripple the Dis- 
patcher. “There’s a leak 
somewhere. Any plan to at- 
tack the Vault would have to 
be based on inside help from 
sojneone who knows some- 
thing about the works, the 
computer, and the time locks 
on the Vaults — ” 

“You think Victor is in on 
it?” 

“That,” mused the Chief, 
“is what I want you to find 
out from him. You have two 
days before the funeral and 
a full day before Mercy Serv- 
ice puts him away. Get his 
confidence; make him believe 
you sympathize with him and 
want to join the A-D under- 
ground. Anything. Only get 
him to give you names, dates 
and places before they shove 
him into the Freezer.” 

A T THE Examination Ward 
of Mercy Service, it 
shocked Paul Dorn the way 
his brother had aged in seven 

DANIEL KEYES 




months. Instead of twenty- 
four, he looked like forty. The 
scar tissue across his cheeks 
and the patch over his left 
eye reminded Paul of some of 
the ancient men who were 
still around to tell stories of 
the Anti-Dispatcher riots and 
battles of the Automation 
War. Victor’s scars were not 
fresh ones from yesterday’s 
crash. There had been many 
other accidents since the time 
of their quarrel. 

u TTOW are you feeling, 

n vie?” 

Victor turned on his cot 
and looked at him out of his 
single eye, so red-webbed that 
Paul had the feeling that his 
brother was looking at him 
from behind a bloody net. If 
he wept, what color would his 
tears be? 

“Paul — ” When he smiled, 
it seemed as if the hard-ridg- 
ed clay of his face would 
crack. “How you been, Paul? 
It’s been a long time ...” 

Paul lit a cigarette and of- 
fered one to Victor. “I heard 
how you tried to redecorate 
the grounds outside the Rec- 
ords Building.” 

Victor’s laugh turned into 
a cough. “Messy landing, 
huh? Boy, would Dad have 
given me a going over for 
that one if he were around to 
— ” Victor’s voice trailed off. 

“Vic, that was eight years 
ago. Forget it.” 

“Easy to say, ‘forget it.’ 
How can I forget when it 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



keeps coming up in my mind 
that, if not for me, Dad would 
be here today — ” 

“Cut it, Vic! It wasn’t your 
fault. You were only a kid and 
you weren’t to blame for the 
accident.” That was a lie, of 
course, and the look in Vic- 
tor’s eye said that he knew 
Paul knew it was a lie. 
Though Paul had been away 
at S & R Tech when it hap- 
pened, he’d learned that Vic- 
tor had been target-shooting 
when their father walked out 
from behind that tree. And 
Victor had been dead drunk 
at the time. 

“That was my first serious 
accident, Paul. You know I 
never had one before that. 
Maybe I was a little wild, but 
I never hurt anyone — ” 

“All right, kid. Take it 
easy. No one blames you for 
anything.” 

“ — and then the accident in 
the Vault last year — what I 
did to you — ” He became si- 
lent and waited as the servo- 
nurse came in and set a lunch 
tray on the table beside the 
bed. When the servo had gone, 
Victor grasped Paul’s arm. 
“Tell me, how are you feel- 
ing? Is it very bad?” 

“Bad?” Paul frowned. 
“What do you mean? Why 
should it be bad? I’m okay 
now. Just a touch of radia- 
tion, and my new right hand 
fits perfectly — ” 

Victor looked around to 
make sure they were alone. 
“Listen, Paul, I know all 

35 




about it. You think I was just 
loafing and horsing around 
before Chief Jennings kicked 
me out of my job at Records, 
but I wasn’t. I know the shape 
you’re in — ” 

“What do you mean?” 
Paul’s head came up sharply. 
It wasn’t possible. No one else 
could know. 

Victor’s whisper was hard- 
ly more than a movement of 
his swollen lips. “I know you 
passed the death-line a month 
ago. I know you’re just as 
dead as I am." 

“You’re crazy. They’ve giv- 
en you too much dorcaine .” 

V ICTOR reached out and 
grabbed him by the shirt. 
His eye glared red. “Sure I’m 
doped up. I could never take 
it the way you could. Dad al- 
ways said you had more guts 
than I would ever have. But 
don’t forget that I worked in 
Records until seven months 
ago. I saw your stat-tapes. At 
first, when your radiation- 
curve turned downward, I 
was happy because I thought 
that was the end of it. But 
when it turned upward again 
after that sharp dip, I realized 
what is was — ” 

“Now that’s brilliant,” in- 
terrupted Paul, “but if you’d 
bothered to check the other 
records, like the dorcaine 
curve and the absentee aver- 
age — ” 

“That’s what had me con- 
fused at first. The fact that 
your dorcaine was normal and 

36 



didn't follow the pain-curve. 
It stumped me until I realized 
what you were doing — hold- 
ing back on the drugs. That 
was smart, Paul, because no- 
body else would have bothered 
to pick out your radiation 
chart from the files without 
a sign from the dorcaine 
curve. Nobody but me. I 
knew, before the Chief can- 
ned me, that you were head- 
ing for the death-line.” 

Paul tried to cover his own 
confusion. “You’ve built this 
up in your mind, Victor. You 
know that all the other symp- 
toms, the radiation, the en- 
ergy decrease and the rest, 
would have been picked up by 
the Dispatcher. The dorcaine 
level alone wouldn’t sidetrack 
the electronic brain. It’s the 
full stat-profile that counts, 
not one or two factors.” 

Victor smiled again, and 
the scar across his cheek 
twitched. He patted Paul’s 
hand. “That’s what I want to 
tell you. Before I left, I work- 
ed out a way. I changed your 
stats with a rocket-pilot’s 
death record and gave you a 
nice, low radiation curve to 
match your dorcaine average. 
You may have passed the 
death-line, Paul, but Mercy 
won’t come for you yet. May- 
be — if things go right — you 
won’t have to make your do- 
nation to the Center for a long 
time to come.” 

Victor leaned in closer to 
Paul. “There have been other 
things, Paul.” He looked 

DANIEL KEYES 




around and paused, as if a- 
fraid to say it. “I took the 
chance with your stats, and 
the Dispatcher passed them 
through without correction. I 
figured it out while I was still 
working in the stacks. No one 
else suspects yet. And there 
have been other Dispatcher 
mistakes.” 

“That’s impossible !” Paul 
exclaimed. 

“Don’t you see yet? The 
synchro-computer isn’t fool- 
proof. You know that Dad al- 
ways said his experiments 
weren’t finished. This is the 
thing he was always worrying 
about. Something’s gone 
wrong with the Dispatcher!” 

Paul squirmed in his chair. 
“If I thought that was really 
true — no, it couldn’t be. Dad 
felt that his work wasn’t 
really finished, but the 
synchro-computer was per- 
fected.” 

“Just listen. I’m going to 
tell you something I never 
mentioned before. While you 
were away at college, Dad and 
I got pretty close to each 
other. He talked about things 
he usually kept to himself. He 
told me that someday the 
synchro-computer would have 
to be destroyed — ” 

“You don’t know what you- 
’re saying!” Paul knew that 
what Victor suggested was 
impossible. Never was there 
a man more opposed to de- 
struction of any kind than 
Isaac Dorn. Bitter as he was 
in that last year, he would 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



never have considered the de- 
struction of his life’s work. 

“I’m saying that our time 
has come to do what Dad 
wanted. We know enough now 
to put the Dispatcher out of 
commission. We’ll turn back 
the clock to the time when 
human beings worked out 
their own destinies, when 
everybody — not just an upper 
crust of professionals and 
technicians — had the right to 
work and have ambitions and 
a purpose. Throw in with us, 
Paul. You’ve got nothing to 
gain any more by fighting us.” 

T HIS was exactly the way 
the Chief had expected 
Victor to talk. And yet the 
Chief couldn’t have known 
how Paul would be torn. The 
Chief couldn’t know — as Vic- 
tor obviously knew — how im- 
portant it was for him to stay 
alive, clinging to the hope 
that maybe there was a 
chance that someone might 
come up with a cure for radi- 
ation-cancer. He didn’t want 
to be one of those quick- 
frozen just a few weeks before 
someone shattered all statis- 
tical predictions and came 
up, ahead of time, with a cure 
for an incurable disease. 

He would never forget the 
look on his father’s face when 
the news came out that a re- 
searcher in Trinidad had 
stumbled on a cure for 
Grove’s Disease of the spinal 
column just a month after 
Mercy Service took their 

37 




mother away. Isaac Dorn had 
always believed in the “right- 
ness” of his work on the Dis- 
patcher’s new synchro-com- 
puter, and he’d brought up 
both his sons to believe in the 
noble aims of Mercy Service 
Through Complete Automa- 
tion. But when Mom was 
needlessly taken away, Paul 
remembered the way his 
father mourned and wept for 
months afterward, and the 
bitterness that followed as he 
tried fruitlessly to take his 
own life. Paul remembered 
how the house was filled with 
misery and sorrow until he 
went away to college. And 
then he heard about the ac- 
cident with Victor’s hunting 
rifle. 

“Believe me,” Victor was 
saying, “my friends can save 
you from the freezer. Others 
have been saved already. And 
we can use you, Paul, with 
your knowledge of the Dis- 
patcher’s Vault and the time 
locks. We’ve got an organiza- 
tion — and we’ve got proof 
that Dad’s suspicions were 
right. The Dispatcher isn’t 
perfect. It’s making mistakes 
— horrible mistakes.” 

“Proof?” 

“Listen, you’re my big 
brother, and if you’re with us, 
I trust you. Just keep quiet a 
minute and listen. When they 
pick me up, after the funeral, 
to take me to the Freezer, go 
to my apartment — I’ve moved 
back to the Basin now. 
There’s a safe in a hidden 

38 



wall panel behind that old 
picture I had framed of Mom 
and Dad. You’ll find photo- 
copies I made of some claims 
records and other data. 
There’s also a list of some 
people you can contact. You’ll 
see that everything I’ve said 
is true. Then get in touch with 
a man named Zetti. He’ll be 
at my funeral. I’ll introduce 
you to him there.” 

H E WAS upset by what 
Victor had told him, and 
after he left the Ward, for the 
rest of the afternoon thoughts 
kept slipping into his mind 
like beams of light flitting 
along forgotten nooks and 
crannies of what had always 
been a smooth, perfectly 
straight corridor. 

He and Vic had often dis- 
cussed politics, religion and 
morality, and the era about 
which they quarreled most 
was the period known as the 
Suicide Year. Paul always 
condemned the wave of sui- 
cides that took place after the 
appalling destruction of the 
other half of the world. Victor 
disagreed with him. 

The fact that the dictator of 
the small Central American 
government proved beyond 
question that the rocket-bombs 
were set off by mistake made 
as little difference to Victor as 
it had to millions of people 
who took their own lives in 
that black year. The destruc- 
tion of so many innocents, so 
many good and believing 

DANIEL KEYES 




people, so many yet unborn, 
carried with it the loss of 
faith in a just and merciful 
Protector who saw, and lis- 
tened, and cared. It started 
slowly at first. And then, un- 
able to justify their contribu- 
tions, however small, to the 
destruction of half a world, 
unable to shift the burden of 
guilt to the shoulders of 
an all-knowing, all-merciful 
Father whose image had 
crumbled in the heat of a bil- 
lion megatons of Cobalt blast, 
unable to look into the trou- 
bled eyes of their own loved 
ones— millions added their 
own lives to the funeral pyre 
later known as the Suicide 
Year. 

Paul said they were wrong. 
Victor said they were right. 

Paul pointed to the laws 
that followed and the provi- 
sions made for enforcing the 
injunction against self-de- 
struction. He argued that it 
was immoral to take one’s life. 
Since no man had a voice in 
the act of his creation, he had 
no right to make an end of 
it. 

Victor insisted that just as 
the owner of a building had 
the right to dispose of his 
building if he wished, whether 
he had built it or not, so it 
was the right of the owner 
of a life to dispose of that 
life. The ultimate decision to 
live or die must rest with the 
individual. 

Paul argued that while 
ownership might give the per- 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



son a legal right to destroy 
his possessions, it did not 
mean that he was morally 
right in doing so. All sense- 
less destruction of useful 
material, Paul maintained, 
was wrong. And usable, living 
parts of the human body were 
the most useful materials of 
all. 

Suicide was uncivilized, im- 
moral and wasteful. 

A ND that was exactly what 
the scientists said when 
they requested a charter to 
set up the Service and Re- 
pair Center. As it was ex- 
plained to the delegates of the 
World Federation, the reus- 
able parts of living bodies 
were far too vital as natural 
resources to be left to whims 
and caprice. The laws against 
suicide and against destruc- 
tion of all usable organs had 
to be reinforced. 

All responsible persons 
agreed that the time had come 
to insure the future of man- 
kind by entrusting the ad- 
ministration of health and 
mortality, as well as the blood 
banks, eye banks, and spare 
parts in general, to the reli- 
able care of an electronic 
brain. It was to be known as 
the Dispatcher, and unlike the 
humans it would safeguard, 
the Dispatcher would be infal- 
lible. 

The Dispatcher, as first de- 
veloped by scientists of the 
S & R Center, was as much 
of an advance as Univac had 

39 




been over the simple, primitive 
adding machine. Through the 
Dispatcher’s electronic control 
of servos, calculators and 
automatics throughout the 
world, it ushered in a new era 
that pointed the way to com- 
plete automation. 

Despite the outraged pro- 
tests from the allied voices of 
the few remaining religious 
groups, the powerful Medical 
Association, and the Federa- 
ted Labor Unions, the World 
Federation Charter was modi- 
fied to read: 

"... that all men are cre- 
ated equal, that they are 
guaranteed by the Dis- 
patcher certain inalienable 
Rights, that among these are 
Life, Parts Replacement, 
Mercy and the pursuit of 
Happiness.” 

The imprisonment of a 
number of union leaders kin- 
dled the spark onto the dry 
tinder of propaganda and pro- 
test. Anti-Dispatcher riots 
flamed into armed insurrec- 
tion, and the people took up 
the call to the Automation 
War. However, with the pro- 
duction and fighting power of 
the servos against them, and 
the newly created, experimen- 
tal model of the Dispatcher in 
command, the rebels were be- 
sieged, dispersed and finally 
defeated. 

In the decades that fol- 
lowed, many researchers con- 
tributed their knowledge to 

40 



the perfection of the elec- 
tronic brain. But the greatest 
advance was the development 
of the synchro-computer by 
Isaac Dorn. With the installa- 
tion of Dorn’s new self-con- 
trolling mechanism, the Dis- 
patcher was able to perform 
its functions independently. 
Except for research, supervi- 
sion and maintenance, all 
decisions from that time were 
made in the Dispatcher’s 
Vault. 

From that time, there had 
never been a suicide ; there had 
never been a stillbirth or mis- 
carriage ; there had never been 
a case of prolonged misery 
and bodily wasting away for 
a person who had no hope of 
recovery. Natural death was 
always anticipated and the 
Donor was rushed to the 
Spare Parts Vault by the 
black, silent Servos of Mercy. 

The Dispatcher, operating 
twenty-four hours a day, had 
the administration of Service 
and Repair under complete 
control. And the Dispatcher 
never made a mistake . 

P AUL went to the Chief’s 
office to make his report. 
He felt no guilt at betraying 
his brother’s confidence. He 
felt only shame at the coward- 
liness that made him want to 
survive for as long as he 
could. How many times had 
he examined the urge to pre- 
serve himself that was strong- 
er than what he knew was 
honest and right? How many 

DANIEL KEYES 




times had he looked into 
his soul and come up with 
the unavoidable name of 
hypocrite? Nevertheless, his 
father’s work was too import- 
ant to mankind ; the lives and 
happiness of too many people 
depended upon the safety of 
the Dispatcher. Paul turned 
over to the Chief the combina- 
tion to Victor’s hidden safe 
and a tape of their conversa- 
tion — carefully edited of all 
references to Paul’s own ill- 
ness. 

It was decided at a top se- 
cret conference of department 
heads that Paul Dorn of 
Maintenance should make the 
trip to Basin City immedi- 
ately. There he would contact 
a local special agent who 
would take charge of the case. 

If what Victor had told 
Paul was true, then they 
would have some top A-D 
names as well as evidence of 
sabotage. It would destroy 
A-D’s propaganda that the 
Dispatcher had, by a series of 
mistakes, proven itself to be a 
mentally unstable electronic 
brain. The arrests would be 
made the following day, direct- 
ly after the funeral. 

It was 1400 hours when 
Paul fixed on the automatic 
beam that would bring the 
jet-copter into the public 
service port at the edge of 
Basin City. The town, more 
commonly referred to as the 
Basin, was one of many Dis- 
placed Workers’ Camps and 
notorious as a hotbed of A-D 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



sympathizers. To Paul it was 
a place that had once been a 
beautiful suburb — the home 
of his childhood memories. 

As the copter landed, it 
struck Paul how ironic it 
was that Victor should have 
chosen to come back here to 
live, ironic that the younger 
son of Isaac Dorn should take 
sides with these Displaced 
Workers who walked dull- 
eyed, in sloth and filth, unable 
to cope with a world that 
could get along quite well 
without their work. 

In the copter-cab that took 
them to the center of the 
Basin, the local special agent 
pointed to the unbroken string 
of taverns and honky-tonks 
that lined the streets. “You 
see these places, Mr. Dorn? 
They’re open twenty-four 
hours a day. And despite the 
heaviest concentration of ser- 
vo-guards, there are crimes 
committed — homicide and sui- 
cide — horrible crimes of 

waste.” 

In the back of his neck, 
Paul felt the prickling sensa- 
tion of shame. He was worse 
than the lowest of them. 

They found the apartment 
where Victor had been living 
for the past seven months, 
one of the old-fashioned plasti- 
glass multiple dwelling units 
that the inhabitants were al- 
ways talking about tearing 
down but never did anything 
about. As the doors of the self- 
service elevator were about to 
close, a little old man in a neat- 

41 




ly pressed though threadbare 
suit squeezed in and held them 
open for a young woman who 
was obviously in the latest 
stages of pregnancy. He bow- 
ed with dignity to Paul and the 
agent and apologized for de- 
laying them. Then he pressed 
the button for the ninth floor 
and leaned back against the 
wall as the car started up. 

The agent eyed the woman 
and then the old man, suspi- 
ciously. When they got out at 
their floor, he allowed the 
doors to close, but then held 
the elevator at the floor by 
pressing the Hold button. He 
signaled for Paul to be silent 
as he put his ear to the crack 
of the door. 

The woman’s voice sounded 
frightened. “You’re sure my 
husband won’t be able to tell, 
Doctor? No marks or any- 
thing? He’d send me to the 
Restraining Wards if he 
found out. He’s crazy against 
servoless childbirth-—” 

“Shhh ! Please, Mrs. Hor- 
gan, don’t talk out here in the 
corridor. Wait until we get 
inside.” 

T HE agent released the but- 
ton and allowed the eleva- 
tor to continue upward to the 
fifteenth floor. He nodded 
with satisfaction, whipped out 
a notebook and jotted some- 
thing down. “Another one 
of those doctor-quacks. Give 
these people the blessing of 
painless childbirth in the au- 
tomatic, sanitary maternity 

42 



Vaults, and what do they do? 
They don’t stop to think of 
the effect of birth trauma 
upon their children, or the 
possibility of accidents when 
they have a doctor-quack per- 
form an illegal delivery. Oh, 
no. They think that the old 
ways are still the best. 

“And the fools believe all 
this A-D propaganda that if 
they don’t sign the pledge at 
the birth of the child, their 
offspring will be able to avoid 
making his donation when he 
dies. Well, we’ll see about 
this one. When we get up- 
stairs, I’ll send out a radio call 
to the Mobile Service Unit. 
This month alone our raids 
have netted six doctor-quacks 
and thirty-eight mothers. In 
twenty of the cases, our 
servos had to make the de- 
livery on the spot.” 

Paul caught the man’s dis- 
gust and it disturbed him. 
He’d heard stories about 
places like this, the sordid 
hideouts of the Basin where 
women came to have their 
children illegally, without the 
painless delivery of Maternity 
Service. But somehow he’d 
never quite believed it. To 
him they were just dirty 
stories that men told when 
they were together in the 
washrooms, or over a couple 
of drinks in the bar, good for 
a laugh — stories about the 
Traveling Servo, or the Dis- 
placed Worker’s Daughter — 
but he never expected to come 
face to face with the charac- 



DANIEl KEYES 




ters of those stories. He wan- 
dered what the woman’s hus- 
band would say when he 
found out. 

And what would people say 
when they found out that 
Paul Dorn, the son of the 
great Isaac Dorn, had cheated 
the Dispatcher with a final, 
worthless donation? 

Victor’s apartment, on the 
fifteenth floor, was a well- 
furnished suite that was com- 
pletely out of keeping with 
the rest of the building. It 
was quaintly decorated with 
antiques of the late jet-age 
period and reflected Victor’s 
conservative tastes and per- 
sonality. It had been, how- 
ever, left in complete dis- 
order, with clothes and papers 
strewn all over the floor. 

The papers were where 
Victor had said they would 
be. Photocopies stamped at 
the top RESTRICTED: S&R 
CENTER. They were field 
reports by servo-investigators 
sent out by the Records De- 
partment to check on claims 
made against the S&R Center. 
Paul glanced through some of 
them while the agent made 
his call to the Mobile Unit 

CLAIM AGAINST S&R .

temity Service . According

but the official sales slip

corresponds to Mr. Flood's 
copy of his order for a male 
child. Mr. Flood protests 
that the Center was in no 
way authorized to deliver 
twins — one male and one 
female — as per instructions 
issued by the Dispatcher to 
Maternity , tape register 
XV P-2 19-60 4. 

No wonder the brass at the 
S&R Center was worried. A 
few disclosures like this would 
mean panic and disastrous po- 
litical consequences. He glanc- 
ed at another one. 

Jefferson Roxy vs. Spare

Anti-Dispatcher Riots of 
the '20s, was picked up by 
Mobile Unit at his home in 
Floribama after shooting off 
his right foot accidentally 
with obsolete souvenir com- 
pressor pistol. Several neigh- 
bors testified to the fact that 
he was always considered a 
clumsy man, tripping over 
things even in childhood. 
Order for replacement di- 
rectly from the Dispatcher's 
Vault instructed the Repair 
Division to provide Mr. 
Roxy with a new left foot 
instead of a right foot. 
Since a second replacement 
of the limb is impossible , 
Mr. Roxy protests that he 
will now be forced to go 
through life, due to negli- 
gence on the part of Repair 
and Spare Parts, with two

P AUL sat back on the bed, 
dazed. There was a case 
even more bizarre — the wo- 
man who had crushed both 
hands accidentally between 
the sliding panels of a room 
divider. (Paul shook his head. 
How could a person catch 
both hands accidentally be- 
tween a pair of sliding panels? 
One, perhaps. But both?) 

Survey of Mrs. Taylor’s 
record indicates an acci- 
dent-prone history. Two 
months earlier she neglected 
to inform the Center that a 
child was being born pre- 
maturely. A servo-guard, 
advised by an unidentified 
informant, relayed the call 
to the Dispatcher, and a 
Mobile Unit arrived at her 
home in time to insure a 
painless servo-delivery. Sub- 
sequent investigation into 
the death of her female 
child a month later revealed 
that the child had acciden- 
tally slipped from her hands 
while she was standing near 
an open window. Each of 
the five fingers of Mrs. Tay- 
lor’s hands appears to have 
the shape of a thumb. 

Paul closed the folder and 
sat back, unable to keep his 
hands from trembling. He was 
afraid to read any further. 
The small dose of dorcaine he 
had taken to fortify himself 
was beginning to wear off and 
he felt jabs of pain in his 
back. 

44 



This is what Victor meant 
when he said the Dispatcher 
was making mistakes. The 
Dispatcher had taken upon it- 
self in these cases to do what 
was fitting — ironically fitting 
— dispensing a peculiar kind 
of poetic justice. Impossible 
as it had seemed in the begin- 
ning there could be no doubt 
in his mind now that the elec- 
tronic brain had developed a 
ghastly fault. 

V ICTOR was enjoying his 
funeral. 

Paul stood beside his broth- 
er near the open grave and 
watched as the last rites were 
performed. A wail went up 
from several of the mourners 
as the town elder pushed back 
the wide sleeves of his white 
robe and enacted the ritual of 
shaving Victor’s hair and 
clipping his fingernails. After 
a drop of his blood and a 
sliver of his skin were added 
to these, they were burned in 
a marble urn. The ashes were 
put into a small iron box 
which was in turn placed into 
the open coffin. 

Paul studied the elder as he 
knelt beside the coffin. He was 
a small, nearsighted fellow 
with a head of flowing white 
hair, who had never suffered 
the loss or scarring of any 
part of his body. Only such a 
man, who religiously guarded 
his parts, was considered holy 
enough to officiate at the 
burial of the dead. 

“Now,” said the holy man, 

DANIEL KEYES 




peering closely at his gilt- 
bound text, “we will all open 
to page fifty-seven, Book of 
Parts, Verse twenty-two ...” 

Only half hearing the chant- 
ed words, Paul scanned the 
audience of mourners for the 
faces of the men that Victor 
had introduced him to upon 
their arrival at the cemetery. 
They were faces that had to 
be connected with the names 
of A-D partisans listed in the 
little book in Victor’s safe. 

"... And though the spirit 
of man may die and cease to 
exist, the living flesh shall 
live on . and the parts of 
mortals shall be scattered 
across the face of the 
Earth . .” 

There followed the long 
passage known as the Cata- 
logue of Parts, in which all of 
those portions .of Victor’s 
body which he donated whole 
and in living condition were 
listed. For those parts which 
were destroyed by accident or 
careless abuse, forgiveness 
was requested. 

Victor winked at Paul as if 
the whole ceremony were a 
joke. 

“. And as your body shall 
be made whole and good while 
you are alive, so shall you give 
of your body that others after 
you may be made whole and 
good of your flesh . and you 
shall give unto others as you 
would have others give unto 
you ...” 

As the elder made a speech 
about the sanctity and preser- 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



vation of living human tissue 
and blood, Paul thought of his 
own body eating itself away 
in living death. Paul imag- 
ined that all eyes were upon 
him, accusing him of breaking 
the birth covenant his father 
had made for him. 

Once the flowers were 
brought up and placed in the 
empty coffin, the cover was 
nailed down into place and 
lowered into the grave. Victor 
shoveled in the first spadeful 
of dirt, and then shook hands 
with everyone as they crowd- 
ed around him. 

“Wonderful funeral, Vic.” 

“So long, pal. Maybe I'll 
shake your hand again some 
day.” 

“Better dress warm, Vic. I 
hear it’s pretty cold down in 
that Freezer.” 

Paul noticed that Zetti, one 
of the leaders of the A-D, 
passed something to Victor in 
the course of a handshake, 
and Victor under the pretext 
of covering a cough slipped it 
into his mouth. Paul won- 
dered if Victor, with the help 
of his friends, was planning 
to cheat the Dispatcher of his 
“donation” after all by com- 
mitting suicide at his own 
funeral. 

“Bye, Vic. Have a good 
trip.” 

Victor nodded. "Thanks, 
Burt. Don’t forget — after 
next week, be careful whose 
arm you twist. It might be 
mine.” 

Paul caught sight of the 

45 




Special Agent giving the sig- 
nal to the servo-guards sta- 
tioned at the exits to the 
cemetery gates. It was time 
for the arrests to begin. 

The solemn ceremony ended 
in tumult and shouting. Peo- 
ple pushed and struggled as 
the servos moved through the 
crowd, identifying people by 
their signet rings. One wo- 
man fainted and others 
screamed. Zetti and four 
others were caught at the 
exits as they tried to make a 
break for freedom. 

“Gentlemen,” pleaded the 
elder, unsure of whom he was 
addressing, “this is highly 
irregular — ” 

Two servos flanked Victor, 
grabbed his arms and rushed 
him toward the gate. Paul 
tried not to look at him, but 
Victor twisted in his captors’ 
grip. “You did this ! My own 
brother! You betrayed me for 
the sake of an insane ma- 
chine!” 

The servos silenced him 
and dragged him off to the 
black Mercy Jet waiting in 
the street outside the ceme- 
tery. Paul felt the stare of 
many eyes on him — the sick, 
angry eyes of men who would 
have torn him to parts if they 
could have gotten their hands 
on him. 

He was miserable all the 
way home. 

J UST before dawn on the 
following night, he was 
awakened from a troubled 

46 



sleep by a phone call from 
Chief Jennings at the Center. 
The words were harsh and 
sharp: “Get down here right 
away. Your brother’s broken 
out of the Freezer. He’s got a 
bomb, and he’s loose in the 
Vaults!” 

“But how — ” 

“Never mind! Get down 
here quick ! You’ve got to talk 
him out of destroying the 
Dispatcher!” 

On the way down to the 
Center, he wondered where 
Victor had gotten hold of a 
bomb. The thought of him 
destroying the synchro-com- 
puter was a terrifying one. It 
was not as if it were an ordi- 
nary instrument that anyone 
could rebuild. Isaac Dorn had 
built and torn apart a hun- 
dred of them before he got 
one that really worked, and 
even then he swore that its 
creation was more of an acci- 
dent and that he would never 
be able to duplicate that ma- 
chine. And now Victor was in 
the Vaults with a bomb . 

It seemed strange, Victor 
with a bomb, because ever 
since the accident that killed 
his father, Victor had sworn 
never to touch a weapon 
again. 

Isaac Dorn had always been 
opposed to weapons of any 
kind. Before his wife’s death, 
he refused to let either of his 
sons own hunting knives or 
rifles. When Paul had asked 
why, his father told them how 
his own father and grand- 

DANIEL KEYES 




father were killed when they 
took up arms with the others 
in the Anti-Dispatcher Riots 
of the ’20s. “They were hon- 
est, law-abiding workers and 
citizens,” his father had said, 
“until someone put guns into 
their hands.” 

Then why, Paul suddenly 
asked himself for the first 
time, had his father bought 
Victor that hunting rifle for 
his birthday? 

When Paul arrived at the 
observation hall of the Dis- 
patcher’s Building, he found 
the Chief hunched over in a 
chair in front of the bank of 
monitoring screens that re- 
vealed the interiors of the 
subterranean vaults beneath 
the Center. The others drift- 
ed in one by one — Butler of 
Claims, Jeffers of Maternity, 
Gordon of Repair — all sleepy- 
eyed and frightened. Every 
one of them knew that this 
was the beginning of a night- 
mare. 

The Chief pointed to a 
screen that showed an empty 
section of the Repair Vault. 
“He was there a minute ago. 
He’s now in the corridor be- 
tween the Export Parts Vault 
and the Dispatcher itself.” 

Gordon of Repair chewed 
his fingernails. “Do you have 
some men at the main time 
lock ready to break in as soon 
as it opens?” 

The Chief nodded. “That’ll 
be two hours from now. But 
it won’t do us any good. The 
Dispatcher’s Vault lock will 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



open at exactly the same mo- 
ment, and Victor Dorn will be 
closer to the Dispatcher’s guts 
than the men outside will be 
to him. They’ll never get 
through in time to stop him.” 
“What about the servo- 
guards?” asked Paul. 

The Chief shook his head. 
“No good.” Then he picked up 
the microphone from its slot 
in the arm of his seat. “Let 
me try them again.” 

H E TOOK a deep breath and 
shouted : “X-three, X- 

four, X-five ! You are ordered 
to take Victor Dorn into im- 
mediate custody and return 
him to the Freezer.” 

The figure of a servo ap- 
peared directly in view on the 
monitor screen transmitting 
from the Repair Vault. “Sor- 
ry, sir. It has been ascer- 
tained by the Dispatcher that 
Victor Dorn is in possession 
of a mini-bomb inserted in a 
hollow false tooth. Any at- 
tempt to seize him or hinder 
him would result in the de- 
struction of a human being. 
We are prevented by the Dis- 
patcher from complying with 
your order.” 

“Listen to me!” shouted the 
Chief, as if by the anger and 
authority of his voice he could 
contradict the servo’s basic 
laws against causing the death 
of a human being. “You must 
restrain that man. He intends 
to blow up the Dispatcher — ” 
“I am sorry, sir. The Dis- 
patcher has instructed us not 

47 




to touch him or in any way 
cause the detonation of the 
mini-bomb.” 

The Chief slumped back 
wearily in his seat. At the 
same moment, the light went 
on, illuminating the screen of 
the third monitor from the 
right labeled DISPATCH- 
ER’S ANTEROOM. There, 
coming into view, was Victor. 
Behind him were four Mercy 
servo-guards like a group of 
children tagging along behind 
a stranger. None of them at- 
tempted to come closer than 
five feet of him. Neverthe- 
less, Victor kept turning 
around to avoid leaving his 
back unguarded. 

The Chief put his hand on 
Paul’s wrist. “Talk to him. 
Try to convince him. It’s our 
only hope.” 

What could he say to 
his brother? “Vic— Vic,” he 
choked out the words, “this is 
Paul.” 

“Hello, Paul.” Victor’s face 
turned up quickly and he 
looked directly into the screen. 
“Glad you’re here for the fire- 
works. I wanted you to know 
we figured you’d do just what 
you did. That’s why I took 
an anti-freeze tablet before 
they got me down here, and 
have this firecracker in a hol- 
low false tooth. It’ll make a 
lot of noise if I have to snap 
my jaws together.” 

“Why, Vic? Why are you 
doing this?” 

“You know why, Paul. You 
know better than any man up 

48 



there why I’m doing it. Be- 
cause it’s wrong for human 
beings to be dominated by ma- 
chines, that’s why. Because 
those boys up at the center 
have played around long 
enough with their Spare 
Parts, and Death Lines and 
Donations. It’s time someone 
took their toys away from 
them. We’ve decided that 
your automatic world is too 
high a price to pay for the 
kind of life you offer in re- 
turn.” 

For over an hour, it seemed 
to Paul that he and Victor 
were schoolboys again, argu- 
ing the good and bad aspects 
of the world they found them- 
selves living in. There was 
forty-five minutes left, and 
Victor was as determined as 
ever. 

The Chief leaned over and 
wrote something on a slip of 
paper which he pushed to- 
ward Paul’s hand. 

If you can’t talk him out 
of it, get him angry. If he 
gets excited, maybe he’ll det- 
onate the bomb before the 
Vault opens. 

T HE thought of prodding 
his own brother to blow 
himself apart right there in 
front of his eyes was a sick- 
ening one. And yet the Chief 
was right. That was the 
only way to save the Dis- 
patcher. No matter what it 
meant to him personally, or 
to Victor, the Dispatcher was

their father’s lifework, and 
the lives of millions of people 
depended on it. 

“Tell me, Vic,” Paul said 
coldly, “have you faced the 
real reason for what you’re 
doing? I’ll tell you what it is, 
and we can forget about noble 
motives on your part. You 
want to destroy the synchro- 
computer because Dad devoted 
his life to building it. You 
hate the Dispatcher because 
he loved it and believed in it.” 

“That’s not true!” 

“Don’t kid me, Vic. And 
don’t kid yourself. When you 
saw how Mom’s death broke 
him up and made him doubt, 
you killed your father. It nev- 
er occurred to me before to 
question his death being an 
accident. But now I do. You 
knew, Victor, how Dad hated 
weapons of any kind, and 
when he bought you that 
hunting rifle, you knew — you 
knew at that time — why he 
bought it for you. You knew 
why — and you killed him!” 

Victor’s eyes closed and his 
arms dropped limply to his 
sides. “You’re low, Paul. 
That’s a rotten thing to say 
to me, just to get me angry 
enough to blow the top of my 
head off. I never thought my 
big brother would stoop so 
low.” 

Paul felt sick inside. He 
wanted to walk away from 
the monitor screen, but the 
Chief gripped his shoulder. 

Victor’s voice was soft and 
weak. “Did I know what Dad 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



wanted me to do with that 
rifle? Sure I knew, Paul. And 
I’ve lived with it here inside 
me ever since. You’re so 
smart, Paul — tell me, why did 
he pick me to do it? If he 
wanted someone to put him 
out of his misery, why me? 
Why not you? Would you 
have done it for him? Did you 
care enough? Did you love 
him enough to take the bur- 
den and the guilt off his 
shoulders onto your own, the 
way I had to?” 

“Vic, please — ” 

“Never mind, Paul. I’m hot 
interested in answers any 
more. All I know is that when 
he died, he died afraid of the 
thing he’d built, and hating 
himself for what it did to 
Mom. It was too late for him 
to destroy the synchro-com- 
puter then, but I’ll do it for 
him now. It’s another dirty 
job I’m taking off your 
shoulders so that you can go 
on living — free of the Dis- 
patcher. And none of it will 
be your guilt to bear, Paul. 
It’ll be mine. So now just let 
me alone.” 

Paul pleaded with Victor to 
listen to him, to forgive him 
for the accusation he had 
made, but the younger Dorn 
just turned his back and stood 
there with his hands at his 
sides, waiting . 

The Chief broke the awful 
silence. “The rest of you bet- 
ter get down there with the 
others. Maybe, when the Vault 
unlocks, you can get to him in 

49 




time — ” There was no hope in 
his voice, but the men took the 
elevator tube down to the level 
of the lock that would open at 
any moment. 

“I’m sorry, Chief,” said 
Paul. 

“You did what you could. 
Maybe he won’t use the bomb 
after all. Or maybe it won’t go 
off.” 

The alarm sounded, indicat- 
ing the opening of the time 
locks. 

Paul jumped to his feet. 
“Victor! Wait!” 

B UT Victor wasn’t listen- 
ing to him. He was 
watching the Vault lock lead- 
ing to the Dispatcher’s cham- 
ber. It was opening. At the 
other end of the observation 
room, a monitor also showed 
a Vault lock opening. It was 
the outer lock. The first figure 
to squeeze through the enlarg- 
ing crack was Butler of 
Claims. He sprinted down the 
corridor. 

“Hurry !” shouted the Chief. 
Paul tried once again to 
distract Victor’s attention by 
calling to him, but Victor re- 
fused to turn. The Dispatch- 
er’s Vault was wide open now. 
Victor stepped inside. 

Both Paul and the Chief 
shifted their attention to the 
last monitor at the end of the 
observation room. The dark- 
ened screen flickered and 
burst into bright focus. 

In the seemingly endless 
vault, the blue computer 

50 



banks were lined up, circle 
within circle, making a sharp 
contrast with the yellow floor. 
The tape transmitters and re- 
ceivers clacked away like a 
thousand angry hens as 
gauges picked up pulsebeats 
of information from the other 
side of the world and answer- 
ed with a clickity-clack that 
sent needles vibrating their 
impulses to the thing in the 
center of the Vault. 

There in the center, on a 
marble pedestal, rested an ob- 
ject that looked like a ball of 
woman’s black hair done up 
in a thousand tiny white curl- 
ers. This was the governing 
synchro-computer that Isaac 
Dorn had created for the Dis- 
patcher. 

“You’re killing him all over 
again!” screamed Paul, as 
Victor moved into view on the 
last screen. “You’re destroy- 
ing the thing he worked all 
his life to perfect !” 

Victor put his hand to his 
mouth and removed the false 
tooth. “He was wrong,” Vic- 
tor said, lifting his hand to 
throw the bomb, “and he 
knew it. That’s why he never 
completed his last experiment. 
He knew no machine has a 
right to rule mankind.” 

“Victor, stop — ” 

It was too late. Victor 
threw the bomb into the cen- 
ter of the computer. There 
was a jagged flash of red and 
orange, a shattering crash, 
and then the screens went 
dark. 



DANIEL KEYES 




The clicking machines in 
the observation room slowed 
down, then stopped ; the lights 
went out; the room became 
silent. In the darkness, Paul 
put his hands to his face. Up 
to the end, he had not believed 
that Victor would do it. It 
was difficult to understand 
that something as great as the 
Dispatcher had been destroy- 
ed — that everything Isaac 
Dorn had worked and strived 
for was gone in the single 
thunderclap of a bomb— a 
bomb small enough to hide in 
a hollow tooth. 

“All right,” came the 
Chief’s voice through the 
darkness, “there’s work to be 
done.” 

“Work?” gasped Paul, 
startled by the sudden en- 
thusiasm in the Chief’s tone. 
“What can we do? The Dis- 
patcher is gone. It’s dark.” 

“We’ve got to reorganize 
the Center so that the departs 
ments function independently, 
even though that means that 
the decisions will have to be 
made by us instead of the 
Dispatcher. Now,” said the 
Chief, his face suddenly il- 
luminated in the flare of a 
lighted match, “let’s get us 
some generators , and some 
lights in here and get down 
to work.” 

“What?” cried Paul, aghast 
— and stopped, dazed. 

T HE data machines began 
to click again. The circular 
tubes overhead flickered sev- 

THE QUALITY OF MERCY 



eral times, struggling to come 
alive with light, and then 
burst into full blue-white bril- 
liance. At the same time, the 
monitors again transmitted 
the scenes from the Vaults. 

The Chief moved closer to 
the Dispatcher’s monitor. 
“Paul, am I out of my mind — 
or are those servos rebuilding 
the synchro-computer?” 

The men in the Vault, 
thrown back by the blast of 
Victor’s bomb, picked them- 
selves up off the floor and 
watched in amazement as the 
servos circled around the Dis- 
patcher’s nerve center. The 
servos worked silently and 
quickly, replacing the fine 
wires and connectors with the 
precision of a team of sur- 
geons performing a delicate 
brain operation. 

“No!” shouted Victor, rush- 
ing forward to stop them. 
“You can’t do that!” He was 
blocked and hurled back by 
some unseen force. 

In Paul’s mind, it could 
mean only that the Dispatcher 
had taken precautions against 
attack by giving its servos in- 
structions for its own repair 
and reconstruction. Although 
no human being could dupli- 
cate the artistry of Isaac 
Dorn, the servos had been 
taught by the Dispatcher and 
had standing orders to do so. 
And now the Dispatcher was 
taking steps to guard itself 
against any other attacks. 

The servos, upon complet- 
ing their repairs to the syn- 

51 




chr o-computer, stepped back 
and surveyed their work. 

“That’s not the way it look- 
ed before,” whispered Paul. 
“It’s not only repaired itself 
— it’s gone beyond that and 
changed itself.” 

For a few seconds, Victor 
stood there in horror. Then, 
slowly, as if some tremendous 
pressure was being applied to 
his shoulders, he was forced 
to bend. He struggled to stand 
erect, but against his will he 
dropped to his knees in front 
of the Dispatcher. 

The servos stood by silently 
and bowed their heads. The 
Vault was a silent cathedral. 

The Chief tried to assume 
command of the situation. “X- 
three,” he shouted at one of 
those who had helped to re- 
construct the synchro-com- 
puter, “take that man back to 
the Freezer.” 

The servo, ignoring the or- 
der, turned and looked into 
the monitor camera. “The 
Dispatcher wishes me to in- 
form you that there will no 
longer be any need for human 
employees at the Service and 
Repair Center. Henceforth, 
only servos will be permitted 
in the Center and the Vaults, 
to do experimentation, main- 
tenance and research for the 
Dispatcher.” 

“You have no authority to 
do that,” shouted the Chief. 
“We are in charge of the 
maintenance and care of the 
Dispatcher. Servos don’t have 
the ability — ” 

52 



The servo held up his hand 
to interrupt the Chief. “The 
only authority here is the Dis- 
patcher. It has given us the 
ability to take over those 
functions because it will 
never again allow itself to be 
deceived or tricked. It has 
learned that power does not 
belong in the hands of Man 
because Man cannot be 
trusted.” 

“You have no right — ” 
“The Dispatcher is all- 
knowing and all-powerful 
now. The Dispatcher decides 
what is right.” 

Paul felt a chill through 
him. The Dispatcher — beyond 
human emotion, human error 
and human control — was fi- 
nally perfect. The destruction 
of the synchro-computer had 
forced it to preserve and re- 
create itself, and had taught 
it the most important thing it 
needed to know — its indepen- 
dence and its power. 

W HEN they carried Victor 
out of the Vault, he was 
hysterical. He fought and 
clawed at the servos who held 
him, turning and twisting in 
their arms so that he could 
stare into the screen where 
Paul would see his face. 

“You know what you’ve 
done? For the first time in 
history, Man has made a god 
for himself that he won’t he 
able to turn on or off when- 
ever he feels like it!” 

There were tears streaming 
down Victor’s face. 



DANIEL KEYES 




Paul watched as they car- 
ried his brother away and 
ushered the other men out of 
the Vault. Then he noticed 
that the synchro-computer, on 
its marble pedestal, had 
changed its shape still furth- 
er, so that the single ball of 
hairlike wires was now three. 

In his own mind, Paul un- 
derstood more clearly why his 
father had been so disturbed 
in those final months. Know- 
ing that his creation could 
never really be destroyed, and 
that in fact any attempt to 
destroy it would be the final 
step in its perfection, he had 
decided to leave his work for- 
ever unfinished. Without his 
work, unable to complete his 
masterwork, Isaac Dorn had 
seen no reason to go on living. 

Unwittingly, Victor had 
performed his father’s final 
experiment. The experiment 
was a success. Automation 
was complete. 

Paul and the Chief watch- 
ed as the monitor screens 
blurred and oozed into a 
scramble of blue, yellow and 
orange swirls. The Dispatcher 
was cutting itself off from the 
world. 

“Well,” sighed the Chief, 
after a long silence, “I’ve fi- 
nally been retired from active 
duty.” He rubbed his neck. 
“Now that we’re going to 
spend the rest of our days in 
leisure and peace, we’d better 
get some hobbies to keep us 
busy. You know how to play 
chess?” 



Paul nodded. “But I don’t 
think the Dispatcher will let 
me spare the time.” He felt a 
sharp jab of pain and he 
longed for the relief of dor- 
caine. “If you won’t be need- 
ing me for anything, Chief, 
I’d like to get home. I’m kind 
of tired.” 

When Paul left the room, 
the Chief was still sitting in 
his chair, staring at the 
swirls of color on the monitor 
screens. 

T HAT night, as Paul lay 
half-awake in the thick, 
warm darkness, he knew that 
they were coming for him. At 
first, the sound of the jet out 
on the street, like a mourner’s 
whisper, terrified him. He 
wasn’t prepared to go. “Why ? 
Why must I go?” 

They came on padded feet 
and lifted him from his bed. 
His first impulse was to strug- 
gle, to fight them off as he 
had done so often in his 
dreams. But suddenly and 
brilliantly, like a torch burst- 
ing into flame, he knew that 
he had nothing to fear. He 
was content to go with these 
silent servos of Mercy. 

He remembered with un- 
spoken prayer that this was 
not the end. In the bodies of 
other men, his flesh would 
live on. And his soul? Some- 
where deep in his mind he re- 
called a line that seemed to 
make sense: “The Dispatch- 
er’s in his Vault — all’s right 
with the world,” END 



THE QUALITY OF MERCY

By R. A. LAFFERTY 



McGonigal’s 



Worm 

It had happened — no 
question of it. Now 
how could it be made 



to unhappen? 



W HEN it happened, it hap- 
pened unnoticed. Though 
it affected all chordata on 
Earth (with a possible excep- 
tion to be noted in a moment) , 
nobody knew of it, not even 
the Prince of all chordata, 
Man himself. How could he 
have known of it so soon? 

Though his lifeline had sud- 
denly been cut, it was a long 
lifeline and death would still 
be far off. So it was not sus- 
pected for nearly twenty-four 
hours, nor accepted even as a 
working theory for nearly 
three days, and not realized in 
its full implications for a 
week. 



Now, what had occurred 
was a sudden and worldwide 
adynatogenesis of all chor- 
data, not, however, adynato- 
tokos; this distinction for 
many years offered students 
of the phenomenon some hope. 

And another hope was in 
the fact that one small but 
genuine member of chordate 
was not affected: an entero- 
pneustron, a balanoglossida 
of the oddest sort, a creature 
known as McGonigal’s Worm. 
Yet what hope this creature 
could offer was necessarily a 
small one. 

The catastrophe was first 
sensed by a hobbyist about a 



54 



day after it occurred. It was 
just that certain experiments 
did not act right and the prop- 
er results were not forthcom- 
ing. And on the second day 
(Monday) there were prob- 
ably a hundred notations of 
quite unusual and unstatisti- 
cal behavior, but as yet the 
pattern was not at all sus- 
pected. 

On the third day a cranky 
and suspicious laboratory 
worker went to a supply house 
with the angry charge that he 
had been sold sterile mice. 
This was something that 
could not be ignored, and it is 
what brought the pattern of 
the whole thing into the open, 
with corroboration developing 
with explosive rapidity. Not 
completely in the open, of 
course, for fear of panic if it 
reached the public. But 
throughout the learned fra- 
ternity the news went like a 
seismic shock. 

When it did reach the pub- 
lic a week later, though, it 
was greeted with hoots of 
laughter. The people did not 
believe it. 

“HPHE cataloguing of evi- 
dence becomes tiresome,” 
said Director Concord of the 
newly originated Palingenesia 
Institute. “The facts are in- 
controvertible. There has been 
a loss of the power to conceive 
in sea squirt, lancelet, hag 
fish, skate, sea cat, fish, frog, 
alligator, snake, turtle, seal, 
porpoise, mouse, bat, bird, 

McGONIGAL’S WORM 



hog, horse, monkey, and man. 
It happened suddenly, per- 
haps instantaneously. We can- 
not find the cure. Yet it is 
almost certain that those chil- 
dren already in the womb will 
be the last ever born on Earth. 
We do not know whether it is 
from a natural cause or an 
enemy has done this to us. We 
have, for ten months, tested 
nearly everything in the 
world and we have found no 
answer. Yet, oddly enough, 
there is no panic.” 

“Except among ourselves,” 
said Appleby, his assistant, 
“whose province is its study. 
But the people have accepted 
it so completely that their 
main interest now is in the 
world sweepstakes, with the 
total sums wagered now in 
the billions.” 

“Yes, the betting on the last 
child to be born in the world. 
It will prove one point, at 
least. The old legal limit on 
posthumous paternity was a 
year and a day. Will it be sur- 
passed? The Algerian claim- 
ant on all evidence has nearly 
three months to go. And the 
betters on the Afghan have 
not yet given up. The Spanish 
Pretender is being delayed, 
according to rumor, medical- 
ly, and there are some pretty 
angry protests about this. It 
is not at all fair; we know 
that. But then a comprehen- 
sive set of rules was never 
drawn up to cover all nations ; 
Spain simply chose not to join 
the pact. But there may be 

55 




trouble if the Spanish backers 
try to collect.” 

“And there is also a newly 
heard of Mexican claimant.” 

“I give little credit to this 
Juanita-Come-Lately. If she 
was to be a serious contestant, 
why was she not known of 
before?” 

The Algerian claimant, 
however, was the winner. And 
the time was an unbelievable 
three hundred and eighty- 
eight days. So the last child on 
Earth, in all likelihood, had 
been born. 

There were now about 
thirty institutes working on 
the problem, most of them on 
an international basis. Thir- 
teen years had gone by, and 
one hope had died. This Ws 
that those already in the 
womb at the time of catastro- 
phe might themselves prove 
to be fertile. It was now seen 
that this would not prove so, 
unless for some reason it was 
to be quite a delayed fertility. 

The Cosmic Causes Council 
had by no means come to a 
dead end. It had come to so 
many live ends as to be even 
more bewildering. 

“The point,” said Hegner 
in one of his yearly sum- 
maries, “is not whether steril- 
ity could have been caused by 
cosmic forces. Of course it 
could have been. It could have 
been caused in twenty ways. 
The miracle is that fertility 
had ever been possible. There 
must have been a shield built 
in for every danger. We know 



but scantily what some of 
them are. We do not know 
which has failed or why.” 
“And could the failure have 
been caused by an enemy?” 
asked an interlocutor. 

“It could have been, cer- 
tainly. Almost by definition we 
must call an enemy anything 
that can harm us. But that it 
was a conscious enemy is 
something else again. Who 
can say what cosmic forces 
are conscious ? Or even what 
it means to be conscious?” 

H OWEVER, the Possibility 
Searcher Institute had 
some spotted success. It had 
worked out a test, a valid test, 
of determining whether an in- 
dividual yet remaining had 
the spark of possible fertility. 
And in only a few million 
tests it had found one male 
shrew, one male gannet, no 
less than three males of the 
yellow perch, one female alli- 
gator, and one female mud 
Puppy, all of whom still pos- 
sessed the potential. This was 
encouraging, but it did not 
solve the problem. No issue 
could be obtained from any 
possible pairing of these; not 
that it wasn’t tried. 

And when the possibility 
test was run on all the hu- 
mans of the Earth, then it 
was that incredible and un- 
suspected success crowned the 
efforts of the institute. For, 
of a bare three billion persons 
tested, there were two who 
tested positive; and (good 



56 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




fortune beyond all hoping), 
one was male and one was 
female. 

So then the problem was 
solved. A few years had been 
lost, it is true, and several 
generations would be requir- 
ed to get the thing on a sound 
footing again. But life had 
been saved. Civilization could 
yet be transmitted. All was 
not lost. 

Musha ibn Scmuel was an 
Arabian black, an unthrifty 
man of tenuous income. His 
occupation on the cardex was 
given as thief, but this may 
have been a euphemism. He 
was middle-aged and of full 
vigor, a plain man innocent of 
shoes or subtlety. He was 
guilty neither of the wine- 
hatred of the Musselman nor 
the garrulousness of the 
Greek. He possessed his soul 
in quietude and Port Said 
whisky and seldom stole more 
than he needed. And he had 
a special competence shared 
by no other man in the world. 

Cecilia Clutt was an attrac- 
tive and snooty spinster of 
thirty-five. She was a person 
of inherited as well as ac- 
quired wealth, and was an as- 
tute business woman and 
amateur of the arts. She did 
have a streak of stubbornness 
in her, but seldom revealed it 
unless she was crossed. 

So, the first time she said 
no, it was hardly noticed. And 
the second time she said it, it 
was felt that she did not quite 
understand the situation. So it 



was Carmody Overlark, the 
silky diplomat, who came to 
reason with her. 

“You are the sole hope of 
the human race,” he said to 
her. “In a way, you are the 
new Eve.” 

“I have heard the first one 
spoken badly of,” said Cecilia. 
“Yet her only fault was that 
she could be talked into some- 
thing. I cannot.” 

“But this is important.” 
“Not really. If it is our time 
to disappear, then let us dis- 
appear with dignity. What 
you suggest is without it. It 
would leave us a little less 
than human.” 

“Miss Clutt, this is a world 
problem. You are only an in- 
dividual.” 

“I am not only an individ- 
ual. There is no such thing as 
only an individual. If ever a 
person can be spoken of as 
only an individual, then hu- 
manity has already failed.” 
“We have tried reason. 
Now, by special emergency 
legislation, we are empowered 
to employ compulsion.” 

“We will see. I always did 
enjoy a good fight.” 

Those who read the State 
Histories of the period will 
know that it did not come off. 
But the reasons given there 
are garbled. “Unforeseen cir- 
cumstances” cover a multi- 
tude of failures. But what 
really happened was this. 

Musha ibn S. had been 
tractable enough. Though re- 
fusing to fly, he had come on 

57 



McGONIGAL’S WORM 




shipboard readily. And it was 
not till they were out of the 
Inland Sea and on the Atlan- 
tic that he showed a certain 
unease. Finally he asked, rea- 
sonably enough, to be shown 
a picture of his bride. But his 
reaction on seeing it was not 
reasonable. 

He screamed like a dying 
camel. And he jumped over- 
board. He was a determined 
swimmer and he was heading 
for home. A boat was put out 
and it gained on him. But, as 
it came up to him, he sounded. 
How deep he dived is not 
known, but he was never seen 
again. 

On hearing of this, Cecilia 
Clutt was a little uncertain 
for the only time in her life. 
Just to be sure, she asked for 
a copy of the picture. 

"Oh, that one,” said Cecilia. 
“It is quite a nice picture, 
really. It flatters me a little. 
But what an odd reaction. 
What a truly odd reaction.” 

T HERE were repercussions 
on the economy. The pri- 
mary schools were now all 
closed, except for a few turn- 
ed over to retarded children. 
In a year or two the high 
schools would close also. The 
colleges would perhaps always 
be maintained, for adult edu- 
cation and for their expand- 
ing graduate schools. Yet the 
zest for the future had dimin- 
ished, even though the per- 
sonal future of nobody had 
been abridged. New construe- 

58 



tion had almost ceased and 
multi-bedroom homes became 
a drug on the market. In a 
very few years there would be 
no additions at all to the labor 
force. Soon there would be no 
more young soldiers for the 
armies. And soon the last eyes 
ever would see the world with 
the sudden poetic clearness 
that often comes with adoles- 
cence. 

There had been a definite 
let-down in morals. Morals 
have declined in every genera- 
tion since the first one, which 
itself left something to be de- 
sired. But this new generation 
was different. It was a tree 
that could not bear fruit, a 
hard-barked, selfish tree. Yet 
what good to look at it and 
shudder for the future? The 
future had already been dis- 
posed of. 

Now there as a new hobby, 
a mania that swept the world, 
the Last Man Clubs, millions 
of them. Who would be the 
last person alive on Earth? 

But still the institutes la- 
bored. The Capsule Institute 
in particular labored for the 
codification and preservation 
of all knowledge. For whom? 
For those who might come 
after. Who? Of what species? 
But still they worked at it. 

And the oddest of the insti- 
tutes was the Bare Chance 
Transmission Society. In spite 
of all derision and mockery, it 
persevered in its peculiar 
aim : to find some viable crea- 
ture that could be educated or 



R. A. LAFFERTY 




adapted or mutated to absorb 
human knowledge and carry 
on once more the human tra- 
dition. 

What creature? What pos- 
sible strain could it be from? 
What creature on Earth was 
unaffected ? 

Well, the largest of them 
was the giant squid. But it 
was not promising. It had 
shown no development in 
many millions of years ; it did 
not seem capable of develop- 
ment or of education. And, 
moreover, there are difficulties 
of rapport with a creature 
that only can live in the deep 
sea. 

There were the insects. 
Bees and ants were capable of 
organization, though intelli- 
gence has been denied them. 
Spiders showed certain rug- 
ged abilities, and fruit flies. 
Special committees were ap- 
pointed to study each. And 
then there were the fleas. Old 
flea-circus grifters were 
brought out of retirement and 
given positions of responsibi- 
lity and power. If fleas could 
really be taught, then these 
men could teach them. But 
though fleas can be taught to 
wear microscopic spectacles, 
they cannot be taught to read. 
It all seemed pretty futile. 

A ND there were the cray- 
fish, the snails, the star- 
fish, the sea cucumber. There 
were the fresh-water flat 
worm and the liver fluke. 
There were the polyp, the 

McGONIGAL'S WORM 



sponge, the cephalopod. But, 
after all, none of them was 
of the main line. They were of 
the ancestry that had failed. 
An ’ what of the noble geneal- 
ogy that had succeeded, that 
which had risen above all and 
given civilization, the chor- 
data? Of that noble line, was 
there nothing left? What was 
the highest form still repro- 
ducing? 

McGonigal’s Worm. 

It was discouraging. 

But for the careful study of 
M.W., as it was now known, a 
great new institute was now 
created. And to the M.W. In- 
stitute was channeled all the 
talent that seemed expedient. 

And one of the first to go to 
work for the Institute in a 
common capacity was a young 
lady of thirty-odd named 
Georgina Hickle. Young lady? 
Yes. Georgina was within 
months of being the youngest 
woman in the world. She was 
a scatterbrained wife and dis- 
liked worms. But one must 
work and there were at that 
time no other jobs open. 

But she was not impressed 
by the indoctrination given in 
this new laboratory. 

“You must change your 
whole way of thinking,” said 
the doctor who briefed them. 
“We are seeking new depar- 
tures. We are looking for any 
possible breakthrough. You 
must learn to think of M.W. 
as the hope of the world.” 

“Oog,” said Georgina. 

“You must think of M.W. as 

59 




your very kindred, as your 
cousin.” 

“Oog,” said Georgina. 

“You must think of him as 
your little brother that you 
have to teach, as your very 
child, as your cherished son.” 

“Oog, oog,” said Georgina, 
for she disliked worms. 

Nor was she happy on the 
job. She was not good at 
teaching worms. She believed 
them both stupid and stub- 
born. They did not have her 
sympathy, and after a few 
weeks they seemed to make 
her sick. 

B UT her ailment was a mys- 
terious one. None of the 
young doctors had ever seen 
anything like it. And it was 
contagious. Other women in 
the bright new laboratory be- 
gan to show similar symp- 
toms. Yet contagion there was 
impossible, such extreme pre- 
cautions had been taken for 
the protection of the worms. 

But Georgina did not re- 
spond to treatment. And Hin- 
kle’s Disease was definitely 
spreading. Sharper young 
doctors fresh from the great- 
est medical schools were call- 
ed in. They knew all that was 
to be known of all the new 
diseases. But they did not 
know this. 

Georgina felt queer now 
and odd things began to hap- 
pen to her. Like that very 
morning on her way to work, 
that old lady had stared at 
her. 



“Glory be,” said the old 
lady, “a miracle.” And she 
crossed herself. 

And Georgina heard other 
comments. 

“I don’t believe it. It isn't 
possible,” a man said. 

“Well, it sure does look like 
it,” said a woman. 

So Georgina took off at 
noon to visit a psychiatrist 
and tell him that she imagin- 
ed that people were staring at 
her and talking about her, and 
what should she do. It made 
her uneasy, she said.' 

“That’s not what is making 
you uneasy,” said the psychia- 
trist. Then he went with her 
to the laboratory to have a 
look at some of the other 
women suffering from this 
Hickle’s Disease that he had 
been hearing about. After 
that, he called the young doc- 
tors at the laboratory aside 
for a consultation. 

“I don’t know by what au- 
thority you mean to instruct 
us,” said one. “You haven’t 
been upgraded for thirty 
years.” 

“I know it.” 

“You are completely out of 
touch with the latest tech- 
niques.” 

“I know it.” 

“You have been described — 
accurately, I believe — as an 
old fogy.” 

“I know that too.” 

“Then what could you tell 
us about a new appearance 
like Hickle’s Disease?” 

“Only that it is not really

new. And not, properly speak- 
ing, a disease.” 

T HAT is why, even today, 
there are superstitious 
persons who keep McGonigal's 
Worms in small mesh cages in 
the belief that they insure fer- 
tility. It is rank nonsense and 
rose only because it was in 
the M.W. laboratory that the 
return of pregnancy was first 
noticed and was named for 
one of the women working 



there. It is a belief that dates 
back to that ancient genera- 
tion, which very nearly be- 
came the last generation. 

The official explanation is 
that the Earth and its solar 
system, for a period of thirty- 
five years, was in an area of 
mysterious cosmic radiation. 
And afterward it drifted out 
of that area. 

But there are many who 
still believe in the influence of 
McGonigars Worm. END 



AFTER NATURE— WHAT? 

One of the roughest problems a science fiction writer has to solve is 
what aliens might look like, and function, and why. All we can go by — 
at least so far — is the life on our own planet. However, that is better 
than none, and even here the ingenuities of nature often make ns kick 
ourselves for not having thought of them ourselves. 

It is generally accepted that the minimum weight of intelligent life 
would be about 40 pounds. No arbitrary estimate, this — it's based on 
how large a brain must be to contain X number of neurons, synapses, 
reasoning and memory centers and the like, and how heavy a body 
would be to support and feed a brain of that size. But nature gets 
around that by forming a body politic rather than be limited to a 
body. For instance, and a very familiar one, there are the hive intelli- 
gences like the ants, termites and bees, and the fearsome Portuguese 
man-of-war is in this category: a colony of small animals uniting to 
form a sea monster that can fish as much as 60 feet below the surface, 
grabbing and devouring creatures that would make canapes of its voting 
members. 

Hive intelligences aren’t really intelligences? Not in our terms, true, 
but they combine to a total intelligence far greater than that of their 
individuals — and so does ours! Examine that statement carefully. How- 
ever versatile a human genius may be, our society is more versatile, 
containing knowledge and skills he neither possesses nor can use. In 
more ways than he or others might concede, he is as much a dependent 
or consumer as the rest of us less gifted citizens are. 

Various indeed are the ways of nature. Light-sensing organs became 
eyes; scales, skin and hair and feathers and fur; fins, limbs and wings. 
Skeletons are outside or in, depending on need. Furthermore, our civi- 
lization requires not only an irreducible minimum population to function, 
but an irreducible number of bacteria, enzymes, earthworms, insects and 
plants, or we couldn’t raise and digest food or control pests — or breathe. 



McGONIGAL’S WORM

J EFF ALLEN pressed his 
nose against the door and 
steamed the glass with an an- 
gry snort. “A bomb would do 
it,” he said. “Something big 
enough to make a nice bang 
and clean out the office, but 
not big enough to knock over 
the building. Ann, where can 
we get a bomb?” 

His wife looked up from 
her typewriter and smiled. 
“Don’t be ridiculous. You’re 
getting all riled up over noth- 
ing.” 

Allen whirled and stomped 
over to the counter. “Nothing, 
you call it? You know very 
well that Centralia is just not 
big enough to support two 
travel agencies. We were do- 
ing pretty well, but cut our 
business in half and we’ll 
starve to death.” 

“Business hasn’t fallen off 



since he opened up. In fact, 
it’s improved.” 

“Ann, you know that’s a 
temporary fluke. It’s bound to 
fall off. Any business he does 
has to cut into our business. 
There’s no other place for it 
to come from. So where can I 
get a bomb?” 

She laughed, and he leaned 
over to kiss her before he 
went gloomily back to his 
desk. Things had probably 
been going too smoothly, he 
told himself, what with the 
boom brought on by the 
travel-now-pay-later plans. 
He was just fifteen hundred 
dollars short of a down pay- 
ment on that rambling Cali- 
fornia redwood ten-room 
ranch house with a rustic lake 
view, and he and Ann had 
been working and planning 
ever since their marriage

three years before— working 
hard — to build the business to 
a point where she could retire 
from her role as clerk and 
personal secretary and con- 
centrate on being a housewife 
with perhaps a robust crop of 
little Allens. 

A ND now the whole picture 
was wrecked by a villain- 
ous-looking man with a 
brownish-red beard and a 
spectacularly bald head, who 
had appeared suddenly in 
Centralia and opened a new 
travel agency directly across 
the street from Allen’s Globe 
Travel Agency. And he’d had 
the infernal nerve to name his 
business the Gloob Travel 
Agency. 

“What did the Chamber of 
Commerce say?” Ann asked. 
“They’re puzzled,” said Al- 



len. “Gloob seems to be an ob- 
vious infringement on Globe. 
On the other hand, he says his 
name is Gloob, so how can we 
keep him from using his own 
name? They’re going to in- 
vestigate. And I stopped by 
for a brief conversation with 
Mr. Gloob. He was deliriously 
happy to meet me and certain 
we will get along fine togeth- 
er. He even promised to send 
me any business he can’t han- 
dle himself, which convinces 
me that he has a fiendish 
sense of humor.” He shook his 
head. “I suppose we might as 
well let Doris go — give her 
notice, anyway.” 

“But business hasn’t fallen 
off. Let’s wait and see what 
happens. There’ll be plenty of 
time . .” 

A tiny, gray-haired old lady 
pushed open the door and

stepped briskly to the counter. 
“I wish immediate accommo- 
dations for Sirap,” she said. 

Ann frowned. “For — what 
was the place?” 

“Sirap.” 

“What country is that in?” 

The old lady cocked her 
head to one side and cast 
puzzled glances about the of- 
fice. “Oh, I’in sorry!” she said 
suddenly. “I must have the 
wrong . .” 

She stepped briskly out and 
the door whipped shut behind 
her, cutting off the blast of 
warm air from the street. 

Ann’s golden head bent stu- 
diously over an atlas. “There’s 
a Siret in Rumania,” she said. 
“But it’s a river.” 

“I thought there was some- 
thing fishy about her,” Allen 
said. 

He went to the window and 
watched her cross the street 
and walk confidently into the 
Gloob Travel Agency. She did 
not emerge, but as he watched 
a portly gentleman came out 
and crossed the street to the 
Globe Travel Agency. He 
paused inside the door, sniffed 
deeply at the air conditioning 
and gave a deep sigh of appre- 
ciation. 

“Feels good in here,” he an- 
nounced. He walked to the 
counter and smiled down at 
Ann. “I’d like to arrange an 
extended tour of the United 
States. Could you handle it for 
me?” 

Ann caught her breath. 
“Yes, sir” 

64 



“This is what I’d like to do. 
Start out with a week in De- 
troit and then go to Cleve- 
land ...” 

His voice rumbled on and 
Ann took notes feverishly. “It 
will take a little time to ar- 
range this,” she said. “Where 
can we reach you?” 

“At the Centralia Hotel.” 
“All right, Mr.—” 

“Smith. John Smith.” 

“Mr. Smith. We’ll get to 
work on it immediately.” 
“Excuse me,” Allen said, 
“but didn’t I see you com- 
ing out of the Gloob Travel 
Agency?” 

The gentleman turned and 
beamed at him. “Indeed you 
did. The man there recom- 
mended you.” 

Allen returned to his desk, 
leaned back in his chair, and 
gnawed fretfully on a pencil. 

T HERE was a brawny, bald- 
headed man who drawled 
with a foreign-sounding ac- 
cent and seemed nervously 
anxious to get to Nilreb with 
much haste. There was a se- 
date, middle-aged woman who 
hovered in the background 
while two teen-aged girls in- 
quired with assorted giggles 
as to whether Dnalsi Yenoc 
was actually anywhere near 
Kroywen, and whether they 
could go direct, or by way of 
Nylkoorb. And there were 
others. 

Eventually Ann stopped 
fumbling with the atlas, and 
in time she even grew weary

of explanations. She content- 
ed herself with pointing, and 
when people with odd destina- 
tions sighted along her waver- 
ing finger and glimpsed Mr. 
Gloob’s sign, they invariably 
bounded away with uncon- 
cealed enthusiasm. 

In between these visita- 
tions, the Globe Travel Agen- 
cy’s business boomed past all 
rational proportions. Allen 
made the down payment on 
the ranch house, and when 
Ann insisted that they were 
too busy for her to consider 
taking up housekeeping, he 
hired two new office girls. 
And the boom continued. 

“Have you noticed,” he said 
to Ann two weeks later, “that 
more than eighty per cent of 
our customers are not resi- 
dents of Centralia?” 

“I’ve been wondering about 
that,” she said. 

“And have you noticed that 
we’re getting fewer inquiries 
from people with cockeyed 
destinations?” 

“There was only one yester- 
day,” Ann said, “and not any 
today.” 

She paused as a white- 
haired, scholarly-looking man 
stopped on the sidewalk out- 
side, scrutinized them doubt- 
fully through the window, and 
finally entered to ask for res- 
ervations to Kroywen. Ann 
pointed at the Gloob sign and 
he left, muttering apologies. 

“Kroywen,” Allen mused. 
“I’ve heard that one before.” 
“Same here,” said Ann. 

ESIDARAP OT PIRT DNUOR 



“I’ve got to get to the bot- 
tom of this. Mr. Gloob goes 
out to lunch at twelve-thirty. 
About a quarter to one I’m 
going over to the Gloob Travel 
Agency and see if I can ar- 
range a fast trip to Kroywen.” 
“Not without me, you are- 
n’t,” Ann said. 

They left the mystified Dor- 
is with instructions to carry 
on if they should be delayed, • 
bank the money, and sign any 
necessary checks with a limit- 
ed power of attorney. They 
marched across Main Street, 
invaded the Gloob Travel 
Agency, and were met by Mr. 
Gloob’s smiling assistant. 

“Kroywen,” Allen said. 
“Make it snappy.” 

“Two for Kroywen,” the 
young man said complacently. 
“That will be sixty-two dol- 
lars and fifty cents.” 

Allen counted it out. 

“Do you have any money to 

“Why— ah— no,” Allen said. 
“No luggage?” 

“No. You see . .” 

“I quite understand. It’s 
best that way. Now if you will 
receipt these papers . .” 

With one deft motion he 
took Allen’s right hand, inked 
his thumb, rolled a print on- 
to the paper, and wiped the 
thumb clean. “And yours, 
please,” he said to Ann. 
“Thank you. Have a nice 
tour.” 

“Thank you.” 

“You may find the people 
a bit backward.” 



65 




Allen said cheerfully, “We 
don’t mind.” 

“Most people don’t. Right 
this way, please.” 

They followed him through 
a rear door, rode an escalator 
down to the basement, and 
paused in front of a metal 
bulge in the wall. He opened 
it. 

“Be seated, please,” he said. 
“Remain seated until the door 
opens.” 

A FTER they sat down, he 
smiled and told them to 
come again. The door closed. 
They were in a tubelike cham- 
ber which had six rows of 
seats dipping across the cur- 
ved floor. 

“It’s like a carnival,” Ann 
said. “Twenty-five cents for a 
tour of the Chamber of Hor- 
rors. Or maybe it’s a subway 
car.” 

“Yeah. But what is it doing 
in Centralia, Ohio? I wonder 
if the Interstate Commerce 
Commission knows about 
this.” 

There was a jerk, so insig- 
nificant that they would not 
have noticed it had they not 
been tensed in anticipation of 
— something. A light flashed 
red and faded slowly. They 
looked blankly at each other 
as the door opened. Another 
young man was peering in at 
them. 

“Some ride,” Allen growled. 
“Destination,” the young 
man said. “Kroywen terminal. 
All out, please.” 



They stepped out and fol- 
lowed him. 

“Right this way to Cus- 
toms,” he said. 

They paused at a desk 
marked “Customs” and a 
young lady noted their lack of 
baggage, glanced in a cursory 
manner at the contents of 
Ann’s purse and waved them 
past. They walked out into 
what was obviously the con- 
course of a transportation 
terminal. There were ticket 
windows, travelers wandering 
about with bags, and a large 
schedule, listing arrivals and 
departures from and to 
tongue-twisting places. Allen 
looked back at the door they 
had just emerged from, and 
saw a large sign. 

BOOLG, INCORPORATED 
Specialists in Travel 
Curiosities 

“That’s no lie,” he said. 

They settled themselves on 
uncomfortable seats at the far 
end of the concourse and look- 
ed around. Allen stared at a 
clock. 

“Screwy time they have 
here,” he said. “That clock 
says five after eleven. My 
watch says five to one. How 
about yours?” 

“Five to one,” Ann said. 

“What should we do? I 
guess we’ve proved there is 
such a place as Kroywen. 
Shall we go back?” 

“It might look funny if we 
went back right away.” 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR.

“True. So we’ve proved 
there is a Kroywen, but where 
is it? I’d like to know. 
What’s the matter?” 

Ann’s elbow had dug sharp- 
ly at his ribs. “The second 
hand on that clock is running 
backwards,” she said. 

Allen studied it. “So is the 
minute hand.” And a few min- 
utes later, “So is the hour 
hand.” 

Ann looked at her watch. 
“Then when we have one 
o’clock, they have eleven 
o’clock. And when we have

so on. It’s just like our time,

Ann was studying the 
Boolg, Incorporated, sign. 
“Boolg,” she said. “Now if 
you spell that backwards . .” 
Allen did so, mouthing it 
slowly. He turned to Ann. 
“Gloob ! The Gloob Travel 
Agency !” 

“And this town. Kroywen. 
Could that be ... ” 

“New York!” 

“It must be.” 

“It’s somebody’s idea of a 
joke.” 

“We’re here, aren’t we?” 
“But where are we?” Allen 
said. “Something like twenty 
seconds from Centralia, and 
New York is nearly six hun- 
dred miles. And which way 
did we go? East, or west, or 
straight down ?” 

“I was just thinking of 
something Gloob’s assistant 
said. Remember? He said we 



may find the people a bit back- 
ward.” 

Allen shrugged. “Shall we 
take a quick look at the 
town ?” 

“We might as well. I've 
never been to New York.” 

“You still haven’t been to 
New York.” 

They rode an escalator up 
three stories and found an 
exit. A uniformed man called 
out, “Taxi?” as they went out 
the door. 

“They speak English,” Al- 
len said. 

“And not in reverse,” said 
Ann. “That’s a blessing.” 

T HE street was a brightly 
illuminated tunnel, with a 
high, arching ceiling. There 
were throngs of people on the 
walks, and throngs of vehicles 
in the street. 

“The underside,” Ann said. 
“Maybe like reflections in the 
water. Maybe somewhere 
straight up is the real New 
York.” 

Allen had stopped to watch 
passengers boarding a bus. 

“We can’t take it,” Ann 
said. “You didn’t get any 
money changed.” 

“How was I to know what 
we’d find here? Anyway, I 
was just looking. The traffic 
moves on the left side and the 
bus drivers sit in the rear.

“Of course we’re married. 
We’ve been married for three 
years.” 

He was not prepared for 
the clerk’s reaction. The man’s 
face reddened and he sput- 
tered and waved his hands 
menacingly. Two more clerks 
came to his aid. The first clerk 
pointed a finger at them. “Mar- 
ried!” he blurted out. 

“You mean they admit it?” 
“The idea — at a first-class 
hotel, too. What do they think 
we are?” 

“Call the police.” 

Allen grabbed Ann’s arm 
and ran. Outside the door a 
bellhop caught up with them, 
scribbled something on a piece 
of paper and handed it to 
Allen. 

“Try this place,” he said. 
“It isn’t a bad hotel and they 
aren’t so particular. But it’d 
be best not to tell them you’re 
married. It doesn’t matter 
what they think, but when 
you come right out and say 
it . .” 

“Thanks,” Allen said. 
“Don’t mention it, fellow. I 
was married once myself.” 
The hotel was small, clean, 
almost primly respectable in 
atmosphere. The room clerk 
snickered when Allen signed 
the register, but said nothing. 
Allen told him they would be 
staying one night, and fifteen 
rallods seemed a proper price, 
and the clerk turned them 
over to a cheerful-looking bell- 
hop. They entered an elevator 
and dropped. 

70 



“It seems all right,” Ann 
whispered. “What’s the mat- 
ter?” 

“I’m trying to figure out 
how to tip the bellhop.” 

That worthy escorted them 
to their room, took a quick 
turn around it to see that 
everything was in order, and 
as Allen self-consciously turn- 
ed his back to him, he thrust 
something into Allen’s hand 
on the way out. 

“Of all the insults!” Allen 
exploded . as the door closed. 
“I didn’t make any move to tip 
him, so he tipped me three 
rallods !” 

Ann took one of the bills. 
“Pretty good pictute of Not- 
gnihsaw,” she said. “Do you 
think this would buy us a 
meal ?” 

“Probably not — not a good 
meal, anyway. And I’m hun- 
gry. We could have something 
sent up and put it on our bill. 
Maybe there’s a menu around 
here somewhere.” 

Their food arrived, accom- 
panied by the same grinning 
bellhop. Allen cringed in em- 
barrassment at the thought of 
offering the man his own 
three rallods as a tip, but the 
bellhop gave him no opportu- 
nity. He deftly slipped some 
currency onto one tray and 
hurried out. 

“He tipped me again!” Al- 
len yelped. “This time it’s five 
rallods !” 

“Don’t complain,” Ann said. 
“Maybe we can work up 
enough to pay our hotel bill.”

"Nothing doing. Here, I'll 
put it all on the tray. The least 
I can do is offer him his money 
back.” 

When the bellhop came for 
the trays, he carefully remov- 
ed the money and placed it on 
the desk. And when Allen 
picked it up later, there were 
no longer eight rallods, but 
eleven. 

T HE day had been exhaust- 
ing and they slept well. It 
was after nine when they 
awoke— not quite three, Kroy- 
wen time — and they ate 
breakfast in the hotel dining 
room to avoid further insults 
from the bellhop, having the 
check transferred to their 
hotel bill. Then Ann returned 
to their room, and Allen stroll- 
ed down to the terminal to 
change some money and ar- 
range their return to Cen- 
tralia. 

The young man at Boolg, 
Incorporated, was sympathet- 
ic. “The rules are strict,” he 
said, “and we cannot permit 
any exceptions. Dollars must 
be changed into rallods at the 
other end, so I’m afraid I 
can’t help you.” 

Allen found himself a chair 
and sat down slowly. 

The travel agent was puz- 
zled at his stricken expres- 
sion. “If it’s as important as 
all that to get rid of the dol- 
lars,” he said, “why don’t you 
take another trip and spend 
them?” 

Allen brightened. "Yes. 
ESIDARAP OT PIRT DNUOR 



That’s the thing to do. How 
many dollars for two tickets 
to Centralia?” 

“As I told you,” the young 
man said patiently, “foreign 
currency is handled only by 
our foreign terminals. Here 
we deal only in rallods. One 
thousand rallods for two tick- 
ets. When would you like to 
leave ?” 

“I’ll think about it,” Allen 
said. 

Back in the hotel room, Al- 
len and Ann sat staring at 
each other. 

“Thanks to the bellhop, I 
have eleven rallods,” Allen 
said. “Our hotel bill will be 
fifteen, plus the price of two 
meals. Twenty-five, at least. 
And we need a thousand to 
get back. Got any ideas?” 

She shook her head. “It 
looks as if we’ll have a long 
stay here. And it’s not going 
to be any honeymoon. We’ll 
have to work and earn the 
money.” 

“We might as well go up 
and check out and confess to 
the manager,” Allen said. 
“Maybe he’ll give me some 
help in getting a job.” 

“Couldn’t we just stay 
here?” 

“Too expensive. Over a 
hundred rallods a week for 
the room, and that doesn’t in- 
clude meals. And we’ll need 
clothes. I haven’t any idea of 
how much people are able to 
earn in this crazy world.” 

Grimly they descended on 
the room clerk. “Checking out, 

71 




I see,” he said. “Accounts set- 
tled at that window.” 

A young lady itemized their 
bill and read off the items. 
“Room, one day, fifteen ral- 
lods. Dinner, by room service, 
eleven rallods.” Allen winced. 
“Breakfast, three rallods, 
Total, twenty-nine rallods. 
Please receipt this bill.” 
“How was that again?” 
Allen asked. 

B EFORE he quite knew 
what was happening, his 
right thumb had been inked, 
impressed, and wiped clean. 
Ann contributed her print, 
and as Allen was struggling 
for words to explain that he 
had only eleven rallods, the 
young lady briskly counted 
bills out across the counter to 
him. 

“Twenty, twenty-five, twen- 
ty-nine. Thanks very much, 
sir. I hope you’ll stop with us 
the next time you’re in town.” 
They staggered away from 
the window, left the hotel, and 
walked half a block before 
either of them spoke. 

“They paid us,” Allen said. 
Ann said nothing. 

“And the bellhop tipped 
me.” 

Ann stopped and pointed at 
a shop. “Women’s apparel. I 
need a change of underwear.” 
They entered the shop. Ann 
made a few modest purchases. 
The clerk paid her six rallods. 
They went out. 

“Another hotel?” Allen 
asked. 

72 



“Yes. We’ll get the most ex- 
pensive room we can find.” 

“We might ask for the 
bridal suite.” 

“You’d shock them. They 
might think we were mar- 
ried.” 

“Isn’t there anything more 
expensive than a hotel suite? 
Let’s find some kind of rental 
agent and see.” 

They found a rental agent. 
He arranged a week’s sub- 
lease on a luxurious apart- 
ment, rent four hundred 
rallods, paid to them in ad- 
vance. He also paid them his 
commission, which was forty 
rallods. He engaged a maid and 
a cook for them, and the two 
servants happily handed their 
week’s wages to Ann when 
they reported for work. 

Allen and Ann went on a 
reckless shopping tour. They 
bought luggage, for which 
they left their thumbprints 
and were paid a hundred and 
fifty rallods. 

Allen selected a fine new 
suit and the beaming clerk 
took his thumbprint and paid 
him ninety-five rallods. They 
outfitted themselves complete- 
ly and returned to their apart- 
ment. 

“We have our thousand ral- 
lods,” Allen said. “We can 
leave any time.” 

Ann looked about the daz- 
zling living room and gazed 
sadly at the fountain that 
bubbled in a far corner. “Yes, 
I suppose we can.” 

“We really should be get- 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




ting back. Doris will have her 
hands full.” 

“Yes, I suppose she will.” 

Allen seized her roughly. 
"Hang Doris ! We never had a 
proper honeymoon. Let’s have 
it now. Sue can handle things 
for a week. She won’t like it, 
but she can do it.” 

“Let’s,” Ann said happily. 
“Who can say when we’ll be 
able to afford anything like 
this again?” 

Allen embraced her fondly. 
“Paradise!” 

“No,” Ann said. “Esida- 
rap.” 

T HEY made it a week to re- 
member. They flitted from 
nightclub to nightclub. They 
ran up staggering bills and 
exchanged their thumbprints 
for cash when they left. The 
waiters tipped them lavishly. 
They attended the theater and 
received cash along with their 
tickets. They shopped, after 
the first sensation of awe wore 
off, only for compact expen- 
sive items that they could 
carry back with them. They 
almost became accustomed to 
starting a meal with dessert 
and finishing up with an ap- 
petizer. They gradually got 
used to backward-running 
clocks, a calendar that worked 
in reverse, and riding down to 
their forty-fifth floor. It was, 
indeed, Esidarap. 

At the end of the week they 
were still in a mood of unre- 
strained happiness, but re- 
luctantly ready to return to 

ESIDARAP OT PIRT DNUOR 



their normal world and go 
back to work. And on the fate- 
ful seventh day a fist descend- 
ed rudely upon their door, 
followed by two heavy-set offi- 
cial-looking men who brushed 
their frightened maid aside 
and stood looking them over 
coolly. 

“I.B.F.,” one of them said, 
showing his credentials. “We 
have been reliably informed 
that you two are unemployed. 
Is that correct?” 

“Yes, we’re unemployed,” 
said Allen. 

“We’ve come to talk to you 
about your employment com- 
pensation.” 

Ann giggled foolishly, and 
Allen muttered, “All this, and 
Esidarap too!” 

“We are in the process of 
checking your past record to 
see if you are paid up to date. 
But we’ve established that the 
compensation is unpaid for 
the past week and we are here 
to collect that now. For the 
two of you, that amounts to 
seven thousand rallods. Cash 
or a certified check, please.” 

Allen choked suddenly on 
nothing at all and glanced at 
Ann’s white face. “You mean 
we owe . .” 

“Every now and then peo- 
ple try to slip away and cheat 
the government,” the I.B.F. 
agent said. “But they soon 
find out that it’s rather ex- 
pensive not to work. If you’ll 
take my advice, you’ll go back 
to wherever it is you came 
from, and go to work, and pay 

73 




your wages like a good citi- 
zen. Right now I want seven 
thousand rallods.” 

“My gawd !” Allen groaned. 
“I wonder what the income 
tax amounts to!” 

The agent was momentarily 
flustered. “Well, now — that 
would take some time to 
check. Better just pay us and 
let the income tax wait.” 

Allen got out his wallet and 
counted. “I have four thou- 
sand, five hundred and twenty 
rallods,” he said miserably. 
“Ann?” 

S HE was searching through 
her purse. “Twenty-one 
hundred rallods,” she said. 

“Leaving you three hun- 
dred and eighty short,” the 
I.B.F. man said. 

“If you’ll come with us,” Al- 
len told him, “we’ll make a 
couple of purchases and pay 
you off.” 

They bought a diamond 
ring for Ann — her third — 
and paid the I.B.F. men. De- 
spondently they returned to 
their apartment, and found 
the rental agent waiting for 
them. A quiet, white-haired, 
fatherly sort of man, his face 
was mournful. 

“You two have disappoint- 
ed me,” he said. 

“How so?” Allen asked. 

“I hoped you would be able 
to take this place for the sum- 
mer. But now . .” He shook 
his head. “Why did you do 
it?” 

“Do what?” 



“Live so recklessly. I don’t 
know what sort of wages you 
pay in your normal occupa- 
tion, but even if it is above 
average, you’ve used up your 
luxury and entertainment al- 
lowances for years. You’d 
have been stopped, of course, 
if you hadn’t done it so fast. 
But all in one week! The re- 
ports are tabulated now and I 
must ask you to leave.” 

“How do you know all about 
it?” Allen demanded. 

“My dear young man, why 
do you suppose your thumb- 
print is taken with every pur- 
chase? All bills go to central 
accounting and a full state- 
ment of purchases is compiled 
as often as the volume merits 
it. With due estimates, natu- 
rally, for such unreceipted 
items as tips and the like. 
Surely you knew that.” 

“Yeah,” Allen said. “Sure- 
ly I knew that.” 

“So — you must leave. You’ll 
be living at a mere subsistence 
level for a long time. But — ” 
he shrugged — “when you get 
your credit back, come and see 
me again. Perhaps I can ar- 
range something just as nice 
as this — if you promise to 
conduct yourselves reason- 
ably.” He left, mumbling over 
his shoulder that they were to 
be out by noon. 

“There goes four hundred 
rallods a week,” Ann said. 

“Yes, and it’s a long way to 
a thousand,” said Allen. “We 
should have left when we had 
it”

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




“I hate to think so,” Ann 
said, “but I guess we should 
have. It has been fun, 
though.” 

“What do we do now?” 

The answer came in the 
form of a performance by the 
beautifully toned door chimes. 
It was a detective with a sum- 
mons. An hour later they 
were in court. An hour and 
fifteen minutes later they 
were tried, convicted and lec- 
tured soundly by the judge. 

The judge’s lecture gave 
them some insight into what 
Allen called Backward Eco- 
nomics. They were, the judge 
informed them, a blight pois- 
ed to strike at the roots of the 
entire economy and bring it 
toppling down. Their offense 
seemed to be: first, that they 
had received more for pur- 
chases than they were spend- 
ing in wages ; and second, that 
they were unemployed, and 
therefore not spending any- 
thing in wages. 

Allen had a sudden inspira- 
tion. “But, Your Honor,” he 
protested, “I couldn’t find a 
job.” 

H IS HONOR flushed angri- 
ly and shattered his 
gavel with one vicious stroke. 
“This court will not tolerate 
such a fiction ! You know per- 
fectly well that any citizen 
who is unable to find employ- 
ment privately can pay wages 
to the government.” 

Allen considered informing 
His Honor that they were not 

ESIDARAP OT PIRT DNUOR 



citizens, and thought better 
of it. 

But their sentence did not 
seem unduly severe. His 
Honor placed them on proba- 
tion, banged a fresh gavel, 
and called for the next case. 

A burly police officer let 
them out of the courtroom and 
into the small anteroom, 
where white-robed techni- 
cians took charge of them, got 
them seated at a table, and 
before they quite knew what 
was happening had their right 
thumbs clamped in a small 
boxlike device. 

“The judge said probation,” 
Allen said in indignation. “He 
didn’t say anything about 
thumb screws.” 

“Quite a card, aren’t you?” 
the police officer sneered. 

Allen felt a sudden stab of 
pain, nothing more. At the 
same time Ann winced and 
looked over at him, puzzled. 

“All right,” the police offi- 
cer said. “You can go now.” 
He chuckled. “And don’t do it 
again.” 

On the steps of the court- 
house they stopped to examine 
their thumbs. Neatly engrav- 
ed on each was a small P. 

“I’ll be damned,” Allen said. 
“They’ve branded us.” 

They went to the office of 
their rental agent and that 
gentleman greeted them with 
obvious displeasure. “What do 
you want now?” 

“We’ll have to live some- 
where,” Allen said. “We 
thought perhaps you . .”

“I don’t handle rentals in 
your class.” 

“Could you refer us to 
someone?” 

The man sighed and buzzed 
his secretary. “These people 
are on probation,” he said. 
“See if you can find them 
something.” 

The secretary departed, 
giving them contemptuous 
glances over her shoulder. 

“This may sound like an 
odd question,” Allen said, 
holding up his thumb, “but 
would you mind explaining 
this probation business?” 
“Try and buy something,” 
the rental agent said. “You’ll 
understand it soon enough. 
You can’t make a purchase 
without receipting it with 
your right thumbprint. A pro- 
bation print is not acceptable 
unless accompanied by a 
waiver of probation officially 
certified by the court.” 

“What do they want to do ?” 
Allen said hotly. “Starve us?” 
“Oh, you can buy essentials 
— the bare essentials. You 
must register at one store and 
make all your food purchases 
there. You can buy clothing, 
but only such clothing as is 
necessary for your work, and 
your employer must furnish a 
requisition. I don’t know the 
exact amount of your excess, 
of course, but if you behave 
yourselves for a few years, 
the court may take your good 
behavior into consideration.” 
“I see,” Allen said. “Tell me 
one thing. Are there any lend- 

76 



ing institutions around here?” 
“I don’t understand.” 
“Banks, loan companies . .” 
“Oh. You mean borrowing 
institutions. Certainly — there 
are plenty of them around. 
Why do you ask?” 

“I’d like to borrow a thou- 
sand rallods.” 

“My dear young man ! Were 
you born yesterday? You don’t 
borrow money from those in- 
stitutions. You lend them 
money 1” 

“Why, yes, of course,” Al- 
len said. “Naturally.” 

The secretary returned and 
handed Allen a slip of paper. 
“There’s the address,” she 
said. “It isn’t much. Just a 
furnished room. The neigh- 
borhood is poor and it’s a 
walk-down, but I don’t think 
you can do any better than 
that.” 

“Thank you,” Allen said, 
“for everything. Does the gov- 
ernment confiscate the things 
we bought?” 

“Certainly not,” the rental 
agent said. “The government 
merely keeps you from buy- 
ing more until you have retir- 
ed the excess.” 

T HEY attempted to trans- 
port their belongings by 
taxi, but the driver took one 
look at the “P” that register- 
ed neatly in the center of Al- 
len’s thumbprint and drove 
off without them. They made 
four trips by bus, and learned 
later that they had used up 
their week’s quota. Their new 

LLOYD B1GGLE, JR. 




landlady was fat, owlish-look- 
ing, and hideously suspicious. 

“One of those, eh?” she 
said, studying Allen’s thumb- 
print. “Well, all right. But I’ll 
have you know this is a decent 
house, and if the police start 
nosing around here, out you 
go.” She paid him for a week 
in advance — six rallods. 

They got settled in their 
cramped room and Allen sat in 
the lone chair, feeling miser- 
able, while Ann stretched out 
on the bed and sobbed. 

“We’d better get something 
to eat,” Allen said finally. 

“I’m not hungry.” 

“We’ll still have to buy 
some food. If we don’t, we 
won’t have any money to pay 
our wages with, and we can’t 
go to work. And if we don’t 
go to wprk, we’ll have to pay 
another seven thousand ral- 
lods in unemployment com- 
pensation at the end of the 
week. And where will we get 
seven thousand rallods?” 

She got up wearily. “All 
right. We’ll buy some food, 
but I won’t eat it. And we 
ought to start looking for 
jobs.” 

They registered at a neigh- 
borhood grocery store and 
bought their entire week’s al- 
lowance of groceries, concen- 
trating on canned goods that 
would not require cooking. 
They took their groceries, and 
seventeen rallods, back to 
their room. 

“Now we have twenty-three 
rallods,” Allen said. “That 

ESIDARAP OT PIRT DNUOR 



means we can’t afford jobs 
that cost more than eleven 
and a half rallods.” 

“You take thirteen,” Ann 
said, “and I’ll take ten.” 

They found an employment 
agency and went their sepa- 
rate ways for interviews and 
classification. Allen’s inter- 
viewer scowled at the blemish- 
ed thumbprint, scowled at 
Allen, and shrugged disgust- 
edly. 

“Hardly worth the trouble, 
bothering with one like you,” 
he said. “You need the lowest- 
paying job you can find. Some 
kind of a sales job might do 
it. You pay a small guaran- 
teed salary and a commission 
on what you sell. If you don’t 
sell much, you might get 
along. It better be something 
that isn’t expensive, because 
one big sale a week would ruin 
you. This might do it — ceme- 
tery plots. Here’s the address. 
And here — ” he handed Allen 
five rallods — “is the agency 
fee. I hope we won’t see you 
again.” 

A NN was already back at 
the room when Allen re- 
turned that evening. She was 
lying face down on the bed 
and she did not look up when 
he came in. He seated himself 
in the chair and put his feet 
up on the bed. 

“I’m a salesman,” he said. 
“I’m selling cemetery plots. 
They cost a hundred and fifty 
rallods each — or, rather, the 
person that buys one is paid a 

77 




hundred and fifty rallods. I’m 
on salary and commission. I 
pay the boss fifteen rallods a 
week, and I pay the customer 
fifteen rallods of that hundred 
and fifty for every plot I sell. 
I don’t intend to sell any.” 
She spoke with her face 
muffled in the pillow. "I'm a 
filing clerk. It was the best I 
could do, and it’s twenty-five 
rallods a week. I didn’t have 
the twenty-five, and I have to 
bring the rest tomorrow or 
I’m out of a job. All I had was 
fifteen — ten from the grocer- 
ies and five from the employ- 
ment agency. I almost got 
fired anyway, because using 
the alphabet backwards con- 
fuses me.” 

“Did you try the new 
clothes angle?” 

She sat up. “What’s that?” 
“I told my boss this was the 
only suit I had. He thought it 
looked pretty good — it ought 
to, since it cost two hundred 
rallods — but he agreed that a 
salesman should have more 
than one suit. He gave me a 
requisition and I bought a 
new suit for forty rallods. 
That’s the most expensive one 
they’d let me have. So it gives 
us a little margin. You can 
pay your other ten rallods to- 
morrow and then ...” 

“We’re getting six rallods 
a week for this room,” Ann 
said tonelessly. “We’re allow- 
ed seventeen for groceries. 
That’s twenty-three. And I 
have to pay twenty-five in 
wages and you have to pay 

78 



fifteen. How can we save a 
thousand rallods, if we go in 
the hole seventeen every 
week?” 

“You see if your boss will 
give you a requisition for 
some clothes and I’ll check 
around. Maybe I can think of 
some angles. Maybe they’ll let 
me take a prospect out to din- 
ner now and then. I could pick 
up a few rallods that way. 
And maybe something will 
turn up.” 

Catastrophe struck the next 
day, when Allen sold a ceme- 
tery plot. “Practically took 
the thing away from me,” he 
moaned. “I tried insulting 
him, and knocking the loca- 
tion, and everything else I 
could think of, but I couldn’t 
get out of it. So there go fif- 
teen rallods.” 

“I bought twenty-five ral- 
lods worth of clothing,” Ann 
said, “so we’re still a little 
ahead. My wages are paid for 
next week. But you’d better 
not sell any more.” 

“I won’t,” Allen promised. 
“I’ll turn and run first." 

They started the second 
week with their wages honor- 
ably paid, and enough surplus 
to carry them a third week, 
providing Allen sold no plots. 
Beyond that lay blank despair. 

Allen returned to their 
room in a fretful mood. He 
had narrowly avoided making 
a sale that morning. His eva- 
sion tactics were so obvious 
that the prospective customer 
complained to his boss. The 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 




boss had studied Allen’s sales 
record, which was not impres- 
sive, and threatened to dis- 
charge him. Allen was tired, 
discouraged, and nauseated at 
the thought of another cold 
meal out of cans. He was 
homesick for a glimpse of blue 
sky. 

He lurched through the 
door and halted in amaze- 
ment. 

Ann had a visitor — a bulky, 
bearded, bald-headed visitor 
who leaned back in the rickety 
chair and regarded him quizz- 
ically. It was Mr. Gloob, of the 
Gloob Travel Agency. 

Mr. Gloob pointed an accus- 
ing finger. “You shouldn’t 
have done it!” 

“You’re telling me!” said 
Allen. 

Ann leaped up excitedly. 
“We just got here. I saw him 
on the street and he almost 
got away from me. I must 
have chased him two blocks.” 

“Three blocks,” Mr. Gloob 
said. “My mother warned me 
not to pay any attention to 
strange women, so I tried to 
ignore her. Unsuccessfully, I 
might add. I didn’t recognize 
her. But you shouldn’t have 
done it. Do you realize the 
confusion you’ve created in 
our accounting department? 
Two return trips with no out- 
going prints to match with 
them. The directors have held 
three emergency meetings and 
the problem seemed utterly 
incapable of solution. You’ll 
have to go back, you know. 

ESIDARAP OT PIRT DNUOR 



You must promise absolute 
secrecy and leave at once. I 
won’t have it any other 
way.” 

“Neither would I,” Ann 
said fervently. 

G LOOB was studying the 
room critically. “Why are 
you living in such a queer 
place? I’ve often wondered 
what people from your world 
would do in our civilization, 
but this is not at all what I 
imagined.” 

“It isn’t what we imagined, 
either,” Allen said, and brief- 
ly described their week of 
reckless living, and the depths 
to which they had fallen. 

Gloob raised his arms in 
horror. “My word! But why 
did you let them put you on 
probation and try to live like 
this? This is terrible! Why 
didn’t you just go back to 
Centralia ?” 

“How could we?” Allen de- 
manded. “The I.B.F. men took 
every bit of our money. We 
didn’t have the thousand ral- 
lods for tickets.” 

Gloob rose slowly to his 
feet. “My dear friend Allen! 
Surely you couldn’t live in our 
civilization for over two 
weeks and have so little un- 
derstanding of our ways. You 
do not pay a thousand rallods 
for tickets. We pay you the 
thousand rallods!” 

“But I thought Allen 
began weakly. “I mean, you 
charged at Centralia, and' I 
paid you, so naturally .

“I’ll start packing,” Ann 
said. 

“I’ll help you,” Allen told 
her. 

Gloob held up his hand. 
“Just a moment now. Not so 
fast. This thing is more seri- 
ous than you realize. You 
could have gone back at any 
time before you were put on 
probation, just by presenting 
yourself and giving us a re- 
ceipt. But now you can’t give 
us a receipt. You’ve used up 
your allowance of luxuries 
and it will be a long time be- 
fore your thumbprints can be 
honored.” 

“You mean we’re stuck 
here?” 

“That’s exactly what I 
mean. You have no under- 
standing of our economy, of 
course, or you wouldn’t have 
gotten into trouble. People 
keep a very careful record of 
their purchases. If they want 
some special luxury, like a 
Boolg tour, they conserve 
their allowance ahead of time, 
or they reduce their luxury 
expenditures drastically after 
they return. Conduct such as 
yours is rare. It’s considered 
a serious crime, which is why 
the punishment is so severe.” 

There was a long silence 
while Allen glared at Gloob 
and Ann looked quietly at the 
floor. 

“All right,” Allen said. 
“Ann, this nonsense has gone 
far enough. We’ll go down to 
the authorities the first thing 
in the morning and tell them 

80 



what happened and ask them 
to get us away from here.” 
“Oh, I say!” Gloob exclaim- 
ed. “You can’t do that. 
There’d be all kinds of unfa- 
vorable publicity for Boolg, 
Incorporated. We might lose 
our franchise. We specifically 
agreed that our operations 
would be kept secret in your 
world.” 

“Tough,” Allen said. “If 
you’ll excuse us, Mr. Gloob, 
we have some packing to do.” 
“Look, now. Things are de- 
veloping nicely and we are 
getting new terminals set up 
in Europe and South Ameri- 
ca. You’d spoil everything. At 
best we’d have to shut down 
our United States terminals, 
and that’s the most popular 
place for tours. You have no 
idea what those tours mean to 
our people. To pay a hotel bill 
instead of being paid, to pay 
for transportation, to pay for 
food, to work and have the 
employer pay them — why, it’s 
positively . .” 

“It’s a dirty shame,” Allen 
agreed. “Now if you’ll excuse 
us ...” 

Gloob sighed. “All right. I’ll 
manage it some way. Go 
ahead and pack.” 

A LLEN reached for a suit- 
case. “I don’t see why you 
make such a problem out of it. 
All you have to do is smuggle 
us away from here. You don’t 
have to pay a thousand ral- 
lods to us. What would we do 
with them?”

"Mmm — yes,” said Gloob. 
“Perhaps it can be done with- 
out any official record made 
of it. We’ll see.” 

A heavy fist rattled their 
door and the landlady’s ran- 
corous voice called, “Phone 
call for Mr. Allen!” 

Allen started. “I don’t know 
anybody here. Who’d be call- 
ing?” 

“Why don’t you answer it 
and find out?” said Ann. 

Allen plodded up three 
flights of stairs and appre- 
hensively picked up the tele- 
phone. “Hello.” 

“This is Agent Senoj of the 
I.B.F. You’ll remember our 
discussion a week or so ago 
on unemployment taxes.” 
“For your information,” 
Allen said, “I am now em- 
ployed.” 

“I know. At that time you 
mentioned income tax. We’ve 
conducted an investigation 
and we find that you have re- 
ceived no income taxes for the 
past five years; The statute of 
limitations permits no claims 
of more than five years to be 
made against the government, 
but as long as we’ve definitely 
established this five-year de- 
linquency, we would like to 
make a settlement with you.” 
“Well, that’s nice of you,” 
Allen murmured. 

“We don’t know how this 
could have happened, but it 
did happen, and I’d like to 
have you sign the necessary 
papers and accept a check in 
final payment.” 

ESIDARAP OT PIRT DNUOR 



“How large a check?” 

“With interest and penal- 
ties, it comes to twenty-five 
thousand rallods.” 

“You don’t say. Give me 
your office address and I’ll 
look you up in the morning.” 
“What’s wrong with this 
evening?” the agent said. 

“I’m busy right now,” Allen 
said. “Meal time, you know.” 
“How about an hour from 
now?” 

“Make it two hours.” Allen 
glanced at his watch and 
counted on his fingers. “Four 
o’clock.” 

“That’s a little late, but — 
all right, expect me at four.” 
Allen hurried back down 
the stairway. “I.B.F.,” he 
said. “They want to give us 
twenty-five thousand rallods 
in back income tax.” 

“Good heavens!” Gloob 
breathed. “You aren’t seri- 
ous?” 

“Absolutely. He’s coming at 
four.” 

“We’ll have to get you out 
of here. If the government 
gives you that much money, it 
will also have to give you jobs 
to let you spend it, and that 
means high executive posi- 
tions, and you’ll never get 
away. Here, I’ll help you 
pack.” 

They left in a rush, dashing 
up the stairs and waiting on 
the porch while Gloob hurried 
out into the street to hail a 
taxi. The landlady charged 
out of a hallway. 

"Just what I expected of 

81 




scum like you !” she shrieked. 
“Trying to sneak out on me. 
Just what I expected. But I 
been keeping my eyes open, I 
have. Here — one week's rent 
for leaving without notice.” 
She handed Allen six ral- 
lods. 

T HEY returned to Cen- 
tralia, and the Globe Travel 
Agency, and the rambling 
California redwood ten-room 
ranch house with a rustic lake 
view, and settled down to a 
peaceful existence. They nev- 
er bothered to explain their 
mysterious absence, and in 
time their friends tired of 
asking. And if their friends 
thought it odd that they 
named their son Kroywen, 
none of them mentioned it 
within their hearing. Not 
even the boy's godfather, Mr. 
Gloob. 

The business of the Globe 
Travel Agency expanded at a 
rate that was absolutely inde- 
cent. Allen chartered buses, 
trains and planes, planned 
guided tours, and applied all 
of his ingenuity in the 
arrangement of colorful itin- 
eraries for visitors from 
another world. Centralia 
accepted the tourist boom 
philosophically and credited it 
to Allen's genius for travel 
management. 

There were no more visi- 
tations from strangers re- 
questing accommodations for 
tongue-twisting places. Mr. 
Gloob explained that this un- 

82 



fortunate confusion resulted 
when travelers already on 
tour attempted to locate the 
new Centralia terminal and 
were misled by the similarity 
in names. 

A warm friendship develop- 
ed between Mr. Gloob and the 
Allens. Mr. Gloob was fre- 
quently a visitor in their home 
and they had delightful con- 
versations upon all subjects 
except the world of Mr. 
Gloob's origin. Only once did 
Allen tactfully refer to his 
and Ann's strange pilgrim- 
age. 

“I wondered when I was 
there,” he said, “but I never 
got around to investigating. 
But the Empire State Build- 
ing — you call it just the op- 
posite, of course, but I won't 
try to pronounce that — is a 
hundred and two stories deep, 
and yet there's an observation 
gallery at the bottom.'' 

Gloob, rocking peacefully, 
smoking his pipe, and watch- 
ing his godson kick fretfully 
in a playpen, nodded. “Why, 
yes, I believe there is.'' 

“Just what do people ob- 
serve from that observation 
gallery?'' 

“They observe more or less 
the same thing people observe 
when they look out the win- 
dows of the buildings.” 

“But there weren't any 
windows in the buildings!'' 

Merriment flashed in 
Gloob's eyes. “Weren't there?'' 
he said.

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



boy was odd/' begins 

JL Gordon R. Dickson in 
The Genetic General (Ace), 
and at once we can expect 
that the boy will somehow 
survive — not only survive but 
win success — not only succeed 
but, ultimately, rule. We can 
expect all this because this is 
the way of mutant stories for 
many a year ; what we get in- 
stead is a fine, moving, excit- 
ing book. 

Gordon Dickson is an 
uneven writer, sometimes 
matchless, sometimes trite. 
He has a queerly complicated 
way of thinking, his best 
story ideas amounting to 
long-chain, highly polymeriz- 
ed thoughts. We put down 
many of his stories and know 
that the man was saying 
something interesting . but 
what? 

In The Genetic General , 
however, originally a three- 
part serial, he has space and 
time, and he uses them well 
His “odd boy” starts out as a 
sketch, but with a trait shown 
here, an opinion there, Dick- 
son dexterously fills in the 
outline until at the end of the 
book we see the man in three 



dimensions, standing clear ; 
and when we come to the last 
lines and the true majesty of 
his difference, we are sur- 
prised — yes, and gratified, be- 
cause Dickson has played fair 
with us all the way. 

The galactic culture Dick- 
son paints as a backdrop to 
his story must rank low in 
the hierarchy of future prob- 
abilities — surely a feather's 
touch would knock over its 
rococo customs ! Dickson's 
agility is equal to the prob- 
lem, though ; by sleight of 
hand he tricks us into suspen- 
sion of disbelief. 

All in all, The Genetic Gen- 
eral is Dickson at the top of 
his form, and a credit to his 
publisher; and it is recom- 
mended almost without res- 
ervation. 

The “almost” is because 
unfortunately Ace has, ac- 
cording to its custom, made a 
double volume of the book. 
The upside-down story is 
Time to Teleport — also by 
Gordon R. Dickson, also 
about a mutant threat to a 
highly developed future so- 
ciety. But here the piece falls 
apart in our hands. It is only 

83 




about half as long as The 
Genetic General . and it 
is far less than half as good. 

W E HAVE five other nov- 
els this month, of which 
about the most interesting is 
a curiosity piece. 

That is A. Conan Doyle’s 
The Lost World, back in print 
presumably as a tie-in with 
the recently released movie. 
Here Professor Challenger 
takes us to a great mountain- 
locked plateau on the upper 
reaches of the Amazon, where 
dinosaurs frolic and apemen 
fight them for survival. Well, 
there have been so many imi- 
tations, but all the same, it’s 
good fun. 

Doyle’s science is orthodox, 
or even advanced, by turn-of- 
the-century standards. (He 
had scientific training, of 
course. He was a practicing 
London physician for nearly 
a decade before Sherlock 
Holmes set him free of pill- 
pushing.) His story is excel- 
lent adventure and his char- 
acters are fascinating because 
they seem to loom out of a 
past almost as remote as the 
monsters chasing them. 

The thing is, Doyle was a 
writer of the pre-Freudian 
school — not only pre-Freud, 
but pre-Joyce, pre-Heming- 
way, pre- almost all the great 
seminal influences of this 
century which have given us 
new insights into the person- 
ality, but not entirely with- 
out cost. Doyle’s characters are 

84 



all very sure of themselves, 
very individual. We have little 
of that sort of thing today in 
writing — perhaps because we 
don’t have a great lot of it 
any more in life. It makes a 
refreshing change to meet 
them here. 

On balance, there are fifty 
books coming at once to mind, 
written by our own special 
pioneers, which are better 
science fiction and better art 
than The Lost World. But 
they don’t have what Doyle 
had — and it’s a pity. 

M ARK Clifton’s Eight Keys 
to Eden (Doubleday) is 
a mildly told, ambitious and 
confusing novel. It touches 
everything and covers very 
little. He starts out by telling 
us that the human race has 
got itself into so serious a 
pickle that it has had to create 
a new social class to haul it 
out. 

These super-thinkers are 
the “E’s” (for “Extrapola- 
tors”), who are “outside all 
law, all frameworks, all duty, 
all social mores.” They are 
trained from youth to use 
their minds in ways the 
ordinary human clod cannot 
manage; they are so absent- 
minded that they have spe- 
cial attendants (when Swift 
invented them for his floating 
island of Laputa, he called 
them “flappers”) to keep 
them from getting hurt. They 
are resented by many ordi- 
nary humans, who go so far 

FREDERIK POHl 




as to try to encroach on their 
privileges in McCarthy-like 
inquisitions, and they are en- 
vied by practically all. Says 
one jealous commoner: “Boy, 
something. Imagine. Take any 
dame you want. Nobody can 
squawk. Take any money, 
riches you want. Nobody can 
stop it.’' How this would work 
out in practice we are not go- 
ing to know because, as Clif- 
ton tells them, no E ever does 
any of those things. 

However, this is not what 
the book is about. A fledgling 
E is confronted with the 
problem of a planet called 
Eden which is perfectly won- 
derful in all respects except 
that it will not tolerate the 
existence of machines or, in- 
deed, of anything made by 
man. Machines disappear ; 
men’s structures, even men’s 
clothing, revert to their 
primitive state as tree or 
vegetable, and will not al- 
low themselves to be recon- 
structed. 

There is then a surprise 
ending which, according to 
house rules, we will not dis- 
cuss; but it seems tacked on. 
It may be what Clifton was 
aiming at from the beginning ; 
if so, he took an awfully 
roundabout way of arriving 
there. 

Clifton, employing such 
devices as spotlighting minor 
characters in a choppy series 
of blackouts, makes the story 
move pretty rapidly. But it 
doesn’t really go anywhere. 

WORLDS OF IF 



HE Climacticon, which is 
both title and principal 
gimmick of the Ballantine 
novel by Harold Livingston, 
is a pocket-sized machine 
which radars the emotional 
attitudes of girls. Its meters 
tell you when a willing girl is 
nearby, and its compass 
needle points her out. It 
sounds, indeed, like a handy 
enough gadget for a young 
fellow just starting out in life, 
but it’s a thin sort of peg to 
hang a novel on. 

Livingston, whose previous 
works have been outside the 
field of science fiction (e.g., 
The Coasts of Earth, a story 
of the Israeli-Arab war) , does 
little delving beneath the sur- 
face of the notion. What he 
does is to set it on Madison 
Avenue and people it with ad- 
vertising-agency types, and 
although they are over-famil- 
iar they are good for a few 
laughs. Sketchy, fast and en- 
tertaining, the story has 
enough moments of shrewd 
observation to make one wish 
it had more. 

A CE has abridged (but not 
enough) The Dark De- 
stroyers, Manly Wade Well- 
man’s pre-war account of the 
Cold People from Space and 
their predictable attempt to 
invade the Earth. The second 
novel in the double volume is 
Boio Down to Nul, which has 
to do with Earth writhing un- 
der the lash of still another 
set of alien conquerors from 

85 





space, the Nuls. Well, things 
are pretty tough under the 
Nuls, all right, but reading 
the story is tougher. The 
jacket accuses Brian W. Al- 
diss of writing this, but he 
has a clean record elsewhere 
and should be able to cop a 
plea. 

As a better example of what 
Aldiss can do, consider his 
newest, Signet short story col- 
lection, Galaxies Like Grains 
of Sand. Here he offers eight 
stories arranged in a series 
to picture eight epochs in the 
future of mankind. The stories 
are quite uneven, but they all 
have strengths and the best 
among them are excellent. Al- 
diss peoples his The Robot 
Millennia: Who Can Replace 
a Man? almost entirely with 
machines — bulldozers, auto- 
matic typewriters and so on 
— and tells the story through 
their eyes (or photo-recep- 
tors). The machines find that 
the men who command them 
have disappeared ; they debate 
the question, then elect to 
trek to the mountains to start 
a new, manless life for them- 
selves. When they talk, they 
talk like machines, every 
thought a neat computer’s 
syllogism of major premise, 
minor premise and conclusion. 
They are machines, instead of 
men wearing tin suits, and it 
is all quite rewarding. 

In The Dark Millennia: O 
Ishrail! Aldiss starts with a 
familiar theme (an alien, ma- 
rooned on Earth, is thought 



mad because of his talk of 
Galactic civilizations) , but he 
invests it with thought and 
illuminating detail and makes 
it come alive. The Megalopolis 
Millennia: Secret of a Mighty 
City is again routine in con- 
cept, a parody laid in the fu- 
ture of the familiar yes-man 
conferences of Hollywood 
producers of an extinct age, 
but by main strength Aldiss 
manages to administer a few 
bites with those dulled old 
teeth. 

These are the best of the 
eight and a credit to any 
writer, but even the least of 
them has an unexpected gift 
or two for the reader. It is 
that lagniappe, the baker’s 
dozen delivered when he is 
only paid for twelve, that 
marks Aldiss as a writer 
worth watching. 

O NE dozen stories by Rob- 
ert Sheckley have been 
collected by Bantam into a 
book called Notions: Unlimit- 
ed. Sheckley almost never 
writes the scientific parts of 
his stories. In fact, about the 
only science fiction story in 
the book is A Wind Is Rising, 
concerning problems in navi- 
gating a twelve-ton tank with 
a chain-link sail across the 
rocky, hurricane-swept soil of 
an alien planet. (Sheckley is 
an amateur yachtsman of 
great passion.) Still, he 
writes so briskly that we 
never miss the hard parts, at 
least not until the story is 



86

over. His great attraction is 
his original and unorthodox 
point of view. 

It is the soft spots in the 
future that interest him. 
Nothing goes right for his 
luckless heroes; their inven- 
tions work all too well; their 
fraudulent plots fail because 
the disaster they aim to simu- 
late really happens ; they 
make compacts with monsters 
but neglect to read the fine 
print. It’s too bad for his 
heroes, but it’s fun for the 
rest of us. 

Isaac Asimov has written 
so much so well for so long 
that no one is very excited 
when another Asimov book 
comes out and turns out to be 
good. Like the rising of the 
sun it is a daily miracle, 
dimmed by familiarity. Here 
the dawn breaks in Nine To- 
morroivs (Doubleday & Ban- 
tam). These nine are not the 
best stories he ever wrote, but 
then they don’t have to be in 
order to deserve our atten- 
tion. 

T WO regrettably less attrac- 
tive short story collections 
appear now to show us that 
even the best may falter in 
form. We expect great things, 
for example, from Basil Dav- 
enport. We cannot conclude 
that we have quite got them 
here. 

Invisible Men is the title of 
his new Ballantine anthology 
of stories about invisible men 
(and invisible women, invis- 

WORLDS OF IF 



ible boys and invisible things), 
and although the stories are 
all right, eleven of them are 
too many. Some would be fine 
in any surroundings, how- 
ever — The New Accelerator 
(Wells), Love in the Dark 
(Gold), Shottle Bop (Sturg- 
eon) — and the chief thing, 
that puts this book a cut un- 
der Davenport’s usual high 
standard is that he has shirk- 
ed his duty. The best part of 
a Davenport anthology is his 
useful and entertaining pro- 
gram notes, and here he has 
not given us any. 

A fine-tooth comb passed 
over the works of Theodore 
Sturgeon has extracted yet 
another collection of his 
shorter pieces, but not one 
which does him sufficient 
credit. 

In Beyond (Avon), we are 
given four ancient stories 
( Abreaction , Nightmare Is- 
land, Largo and The Bones — 
all originally published in the 
forties, and all showing their 
age), one recent reprint. 
Like Young, and one story so 
new that it has never before 
been published. This one is 
entitled Need. It is a long 
story, almost half the size of 
a book ; if it were up to 
Sturgeon’s elevated plane of 
accomplishment, its inclusion 
here would be all the recom- 
mendation this volume needs. 
But 'it isn’t. There are a lot of 
words in the piece, but the 
story itself is a slight and un- 
resolved fantasy, characters 

87 




queer without being compel- 
ling, plot hanging on air. 
There is, says the story, a man 
living in Nyack who can de- 
tect what people need. He 
gives it to them. That’s it. 
That’s all. 

Sturgeon can, should and 
often does give us so much 
more than this. Of all the 
writers practicing science fic- 
tion today, there are only 
about a dozen true leaders. 
The others are excellent 
craftsmen, surely — their con- 
tributions are considerable 
and welcome— but they are 
the infantry troops who oc- 
cupy and consolidate the gains 
of the advance party. Stur- 
geon is one of the leaders. The 
disappointment is that in this 
book he leads us nowhere we 
have not already been. Deriv- 
ative, minor and rather 
weary, it does not do justice 
to a mdn who, at the peak of 
his form, simply cannot be 
matched. 

A T THE last we come to a 
look at what the publish- 
ers are providing for us in 
the way of non-fiction. If you 
like mathematics, for exam- 
ple, you will be interested in 
Constance Reid’s From Zero 
to Infinity, a new revised edi- 
tion of which is now available 
from Crowell. 

Mrs. Reid does not intend 
to tell you how to add and 
subtract, but to inform and 
entertain you with some of 
the properties and curiosities 

88 



of numbers themselves. See, 
for example, if you can make 
any sense of this arrangement 
of the digits from 0 to 9: 

8549176320 

They are arranged accord- 
ing to system, but what is the 
system? “Secretaries usually 
outwit mathematicians on 
this one,” says Mrs. Reid. The 
reason for this is that the ar- 
rangement is not a mathemat- 
ical one; and if you wonder 
why then it is relevant to this 
mathematical book, it is be- 
cause the attractions of num- 
ber study are not confined to 
its mathematical aspects. 
There is something grand and 
terrible about the proper- 
ties of numbers and their 
subtle, unexpected relation- 
ships, something which for 
thousands of years has caused 
amateurs of number study to 
assign metaphysical or super- 
stitious properties to the var- 
ious integers. 

It is the triumph of mathe- 
matics that all of its laws are 
true always — in every case — 
not only in the case of the 
numbers and quantities we 
know, but in the case of every 
number and quantity that any- 
one can ever know. A mathe- 
matical proof does not rest on 
a series of test observations, 
but on a statement of general 
laws which can be shown to 
be universally, necessarily 
true. Mrs. Reid points up the 
difference : 



FREDERIK POHL 




“In sciences other than 
mathematics a sampling must 
often serve as verification of 
a hypothesis. Mathematicians, 
who by the nature of their 
science can prove or disprove 
a hypothesis with complete 
finality, have a smug little 
joke that they call ‘The 
Physicist’s Proof that All Odd 
Numbers Are Prime.’ The 
physicist, so the story goes, 
starts out by classifying one 
as prime because it is divis- 
ible only by itself and one. 
Then three is prime, five is 
prime, seven is prime, nine — 
divisible by three? Well, 
that’s just an exception — 
eleven is prime, thirteen is 
prime. Obviously all odd num- 
bers with the exception of 
nine are prime!” 

From, Zero to Infinity is a 
catch-all, and as it is quite 
short there is much that has 
not been caught. By and large, 
though, it is the best brief, 
popular introduction to num- 
ber lore on the market, ac- 
cessible to those with no 
mathematical training but re- 
warding even for those who 
have. 

Oh, and that arrangement 
of the digits? Spell out the list 
and you will see the answer 
at once: 



They are in alphabetical 
order. 

I T WOULD be hard to find 
a better popular history of 
astronomy than Rudolf Thiel’s 
And There Was Light (New 
American Library.) Some five 
thousand years of star-gaz- 
ing need to be covered. In less 
than 400 pages Thiel encom- 
passes the lot. 

Just about everything is 
here. Thiel outlines for us all 
the major theories of past and 
present and describes for • us 
the observations from which 
they sprang; he even finds 
time for human sidelights 
like Tycho Brahe’s youthful 
dueling accident (which 
forced him during all his 
adult life to wear a gutta- 
percha nose) and the fussy 
housewifery of the founder of 
Greenwich Observatory (he 
spent endless hours lettering 
the word “empty” on boxes 
from which equipment had 
been removed). Admirably 
organized, well illustrated, 
the book has only one serious 
flaw. That lies in its closing 
pages where, in an attempt to 
keep it “up to the minute,” 
some of its conjectures are 
outdated and already nearly 
forgotten. END

T OMMY wasn’t really a 
timid child. Sometimes he 
didn’t understand things and

grown-ups couldn’t or would-

were perfectly clear to him 
and he was more puzzled. Oc- 
casionally such things wor- 
ried and even upset him a 
little. Then Momma and some- 
times Daddy would translate 
bafflement into silly adult 
terms and think that he was 
afraid. 

It was that way about the 
hole in the closet when Tommy 
was just a bit over three. 
Tommy wasn’t really afraid. 
Mr. Bear was afraid and the 
thing did puzzle Tommy. So 
he asked about it, but he never 
did get any sensible or satis- 
factory answers, and that did 
worry and perhaps even upset 
him a little. 



Don’t Think About It 



By WILLIAM W. STUART But he wasn’t afraid, even 

before Daddy finally told him, 
“Now, Tommy, boy. Don’t 
think about it and it won't 
scare you. Really, there is 
nothing there to hurt you, if 
you just don’t think about it. 
So don’t you think about it 
any more — there’s Daddy’s 
big boy." 



90 




This certainly was not any 
sort of explanation. But still 
Tommy did try hard not to 
think about it, as Daddy said. 
And now he really doesn’t 
think about it at all any more. 
Or about Aunt Martha, either. 

The hole was in the closet 
in Tommy’s room. Tommy 
and Momma and Daddy lived 
in a not very big, not very 
new frame house on the edge 
of the city and Aunt Martha 
lived with them. Tommy did- 
n’t — at least not yet, although 
there were promises — have 
any brothers or sisters. But 
he did have his own room and 
a family of his own, too. It 
was the extra bedroom and it 
had a closet that was cramp- 
ed and with no light. Tommy 
liked his room. It was small, 
with a small bed, and it be- 
longed to him, along with his 
family of Mr. Bear and Old 
Rabbit and Kokey Koala. It 
was also in easy crying range 
of Momma and Daddy’s room 
and Aunt Martha’s room, so 
if Mr. Bear, who was the 
timid one, got frightened in 
the night, Tommy could cry — 
purely in Mr. Bear’s behalf — 
to bring help. Or at least com- 
pany. 

Tommy and his family all 
liked the closet well enough 
too, except for the shelf that 
was out of reach even from 
the “don’t climb” stool. The 
closet was good to hide in or 
play bear cave or rabbit hole 
and fine for finding missing 
toys after Momma had a spell 

DON’T THINK ABOUT IT 



of playing cleaning house. 

The day Tommy found the 
hole in the closet was the 
week after his third birthday. 
Daddy was at work. Momma 
was out shopping. It was a 
rainy afternoon. Aunt Martha 
was sitting with Tommy and 
the afternoon television. 

H E WAS in his room with 
his family and they all 
agreed as soon as they heard 
the television coming on 
strong that it would be a very 
poor afternoon to waste on a 
nap. Besides, Mr. Bear’s feel- 
ings had been hurt by having 
been somewhat left out of 
things recently in favor of 
new birthday presents, now 
largely broken or tiresome. To 
make it up to him, Tommy 
and Old Rabbit and Kokey 
all agreed to play bear cave in 
the closet. It was a nice game 
and going well enough, except 
for some grumbling from 
Kokey Koala, who always 
wanted to argue and claimed 
that bears lived in trees, not 
caves. 

But then — and it was Mr. 
Bear’s fault for wanting it 
darker, so he could hibernate 
— the closet door shut tight. 
That didn’t seem so serious at 
first. It would only mean a 
scolding for being out of bed 
when Aunt Martha would 
come to open it after Tommy 
hollered loud enough. And 
then there was the hole in the 
closet, back in the comer next 
to the broken drum. They all 

91 




saw it and they heard the 
Ugly Thing talking or think- 
ing at them. It stretched out a 
part of itself at Mr. Bear, who 
was the closest. 

It didn’t grab Mr. Bear, 
but he was terrified just the 
same. And none of them liked 
it. They didn’t like it at all. 
The Ugly Thing couldn’t come 
out of the hole because the 
hole wasn’t big enough yet, 
but it tried and it was making 
the hole bigger. And it kept 
thinking at them, red 
thoughts, and hungry, as it 
tore at the edges of the hole. 
The family all looked to 
Tommy, so Tommy cried and 
yelled. 

Finally Aunt Martha heard 
him and came to open the 
door. Then the afternoon sun- 
light streamed across the floor 
into the closet and the ugly 
red thoughts from the Thing 
pulled back, far back, so you 
could barely notice them, and 
you couldn’t see the hole any 
more, even though you knew 
it was still there. At least 
Tommy and Mr. Bear and Old 
Rabbit and Kokey Koala 
knew. 

After she opened the closet 
door and carried Tommy from 
the closet to the living room, 
Aunt Martha scolded. She 
wasn’t really mad because she 
had waited until a commercial 
interrupted her television pro- 
gram before answering the 
cries from the closet. But she 
scolded because she was Aunt 
Martha and scolding was 

92 



what Aunt Martha did. A 
really good cry, even one 
worked up strictly as a service 
for a companion, takes a little 
time to turn off. Then, after 
a few settling gulps. Tommy 
tried to explain. 

“Auntie. Aunt Martha, 
there’s a hole in the cave — 
in the closet— and there’s a 
Thing inside of it.” 

He looked at Mr. Bear 
whom he was holding by one 
foot and at Kokey, dropped by 
Aunt Martha on the sofa, for 
confirmation. Then, quickly, 
he wriggled down from Aun- 
tie’s lap. Old Rabbit! 

B RAVELY, Tommy ran to 
the closet and was re- 
lieved. The door was open 
and, in the gray afternoon 
light, the hole was still not to 
be seen. Old Rabbit, who al- 
ways had a bad temper, was 
annoyed and snappish at hav- 
ing been left behind. But he 
was there and all right. Tom- 
my rescued him and ran back 
to Aunt Martha. 

“It was hungry,” he con- 
tinued his explanation. 

Aunt Martha, as always, 
was difficult. “Who is hungry? 
You shouldn’t be hungry, 
Tommy. You just had your 
lunch an hour ago. Do you 
want a glass of milk?” 

“Not me hungry.” Tommy 
was impatient. Aunt Martha 
never seemed able to grasp 
any idea more complex than a 
glass of milk or wet pants. 
Little boys, in her mind, near- 

WILLIAM W. STUART 




ly always either wanted the 
one or had the other. Such 
things she could and did at- 
tend to with a virtuous sense 
of duty done. But anything 
else was beyond her. 

“Tommy! Are your pants 
wet?” 

Tommy sighed in resigna- 
tion and wet his pants. It was 
the only thing to do. Other- 
wise Auntie would fuss and 
fume, accomplishing nothing, 
understanding nothing, for 
the rest of the afternoon. 

Ten minutes later, in dry 
pants, he finished an unwant- 
ed glass of milk. Aunt Mar- 
tha, conscience appeased, re- 
turned to soap opera. Tommy 
and his family, nap safely for- 
gotten, played away the after- 
noon — but not in the closet or 
even, as was usual on rainy 
days, in Tommy’s room. In- 
stead, finding Daddy’s ~ old 
briefcase full of papers they 
played office in the family 
room, with Old Rabbit grumb- 
ling about having to be Miss 
Wicksey, who drove the elec- 
tric typewriter in Daddy’s 
office. 

Momma and Daddy came 
home together at a bit after 
five. Tommy took his scolding 
about messing up Daddy’s 
papers in good part. He had 
expected it. But Aunt Martha 
was angry about the scolding 
she got for letting him, mild 
though it was. 

In retaliation, she said, 
“Tommy, you were a naughty, 
naughty boy. And for being so 

DON’T THINK ABOUT IT 



naughty you must take your 
big bear and your rabbit and 
the little bear or whatever the 
thing is and put them away 
in the closet. And leave them 
there till tomorrow.” 

“No! No, no, no, I won’t! 
It isn’t fair. They weren’t bad. 
And the Ugly Thing is in the 
hole and it might come out 
and it’s hungry and — and my 
family is all afraid.” 

“Tommy!” Aunt Martha’s 
voice was sharp. “You stop 
that nonsense and put your 
toys — ” 

“Wait. Wait up now,” said 
Daddy, who also lived in the 
grown-up world, but who 
sometimes tried to understand 
things. “What is this about a 
hole in the closet? What about 
something being hungry?” 
“That’s all,” said Tommy. 
"The Ugly Thing in the hole 
in the closet. It is hungry.” 
There was more to it than 
that, of course, but how could 
a thing like that be explained 
through a wall of grown, 
closed minds? There was the 
hole in the closet. You couldn’t 
exactly see it. You could only 
sort of feel seeing it and the 
hairy Thing — at least it seem- 
ed hairy and shapeless, or 
having many different shapes 
and a mouth and sharp teeth 
— and it had reached out with 
something and touched Mr. 
Bear and would have eaten 
him too, if he had blood. But 
then it had pulled back from 
Mr. Bear and red hunger 
thoughts came stronger and 

93 




stronger. Even now, stretch- 
ing out from the hole where 
it was hidden there in the 
closet. Tommy could feel the 
reaching, greedy thoughts. 
But he couldn’t explain all 
that. 

“There is a hole in the clos- 
et,” Tommy said again. 

B UT he knew that not even 
Daddy would understand. 
Of course Momma wouldn’t. 
Not Momma, who was loving 
but very busy and just sat so 
often dreaming or listening 
to baby sister that they said 
was in her stomach, so big 
and fat now as to leave little 
lap room. Momma was too oc- 
cupied looking inward to look 
out much at Tommy. Daddy, 
to give him credit, was nearly 
always willing to look, but 
there were so many things he 
couldn’t see. Still Tommy had 
to try. 

“The Ugly Thing in the 
hole. It wants something to 
eat.” 

“Oh, Tommy ! Such horrible 
nonsense !” That was Momma. 
She wasn’t even going to 
think about it. It is a question 
sometimes whether baby sis- 
ters are worth all the bother 
and trouble. 

“Now, Tommy.” Daddy was 
being helpful. “You say there 
is a hole in your closet? And 
that there is something in the 
hole?” 

“Well-11. Sort of.” Really, 
the Ugly Thing wasn’t so 
much in the hole as on the 



other side of it. But that was 
close enough. 

“All right then, Tommy. 
Suppose you show it to me.” 

“What?” 

“Show me the hole. Tom- 
my.” 

“Now?” 

“Yes.” 

“The hole in the closet?” 

“Tommy!” 

“Yes, Daddy.” This wasn’t 
going to work out to anything 
good and Tommy didn’t want 
to go back to the closet and 
close the closet door anyway. 
The Thing didn’t eat Mr. Bear 
because Mr. Bear didn’t have 
blood. But Daddy had and . 
“Tommy!” 

They went to the closet. At 
least, if he was risking a Dad- 
dy, Tommy thought, he was 
protecting Mr. Bear and the 
others. 

“Now where is this hole, 
Tommy?” 

“Over there by the corner.” 
Tommy pointed. 

Daddy went into the closet 
to look. Tommy started to 
close the door. In the black 
dark, Daddy would see what 
Tommy meant about the 
Thing in the hole. From the 
outside, Tommy started to 
close the door. It was a small 
closet and hardly big enough 
for both of them. 

"Tommy ! What are you 
trying to do? Open that door.” 

“But—” After all, the hole 
wasn’t there, or scarcely 
seemed to be there, except in 
the dark.

WILLIAM W. STUART 




“Open it up wider. Hm-m. 
I believe I do see. Wait till I 
get my lighter . Say, by 
George, I believe you’re right. 
There is a little hole there. 
Looks like a mouse hole.” 
There it was, as Tommy 
might have known. Grown-ups 
will always avoid seeing the 
important things. Of course 
there was a mouse hole there, 
the home of the little old Mr. 
Mouse with the wiggly nose 
and the gray whiskers. He 
had been nice. But he wasn’t 
there any more and Tommy 
had a pretty clear idea of 
what had happened to him. 
That poor little old Mr. Mouse 
had had blood. 

“But, Daddy — ” 

It was hopeless. “Dome! 
Martha!” Daddy’s hunting in- 
stinct was aroused. “Have we 
got a mouse trap? Any 
cheese? There is a hole in 
that closet, a little old mouse 
hole and I’m going to — ” 
Well, perhaps this would be 
better than if he hadn’t found 
anything. 

Tommy followed Daddy 
about as he finally located a 
mouse trap. No cheese? He 
cut a little piece of meat for 
bait. Of course Tommy knew 
no trap would catch the Ugly 
Thing. 

“What in the world hap- 
pened to my lighter?” Daddy 
wanted to know. Tommy did- 
n’t answer that. But at least 
everybody, even Aunt Mar- 
tha, had forgotten about shut- 
ting Tommy’s family up in the 

DON'T THINK ABOUT IT 



closet. For now that was 
enough. 

But later, after supper, 
after bath, after the shooting 
picture on the TV, it was time 
for bed. 

“Daddy?” 

“Get on to bed now, son. 
Past bedtime. Hop to it.” 
“Daddy, I want to sleep 
with you and Momma to- 
night.” 

W ELL, it was a mighty 
dark night. The after- 
noon rain had built up into a 
real storm. Mr. Bear was ter- 
rified. Kokey was scared and 
even tough Old Rabbit didn’t 
want to sleep in Tommy’s 
room with the Ugly Thing in 
the hole so hungry and wait- 
ing to rip its way out of the 
hole when it got dark enough 
— and only the street light 
outside the room to keep away 
the dark because they would 
never let Tommy keep his 
light on at night. 

“My family and me don’t 
want to sleep in my room to- 
night.” 

“Now, Tommy, just because 
it’s a little stormy — Daddy’s 
big boy isn’t afraid of a little 
wind and rain?” 

“I’m not afraid, Daddy. It’s 
my family. You know how 
families are. You always say 
about Momma — ” 

“Never mind that now. To 
bed. Your own bed.” 

“But, Daddy, there’s the 
Ugly Thing in the hole ! And 
it’s hungry!” 



95 




"The mouse?” 

Daddy went to look at his 
trap, switching on the light in 
Tommy’s room. He came back 
in a minute. 

“The little devil!” 

Did Daddy know? No. 

“The little devil got away 
with the bait, clean as a whis- 
tle. Only a little plaster dust 
or something left in the trap 
where I put the meat.” 

Mr. Bear shivered. “Now 
don’t be foolish, Bear. You 
don’t have blood. The Ugly 
Thing won’t get you,” Tommy 
told him softly. But Mr. Bear 
wouldn’t listen. He was a cry- 
baby, a scaredy-cat. But to tell 
the truth — the real, honest 
truth — the whole family and 
even Tommy didn’t feel too 
good about it. 

“Tommy? What was that 
you were saying?” 

“Daddy ! I wanna sleep with 
you and Momma. Me and my 
family. We’re scared of that 
Thing.” Tommy knew it was 
no less than his duty to pro- 
tect them all. 

“Oh, now, Tommy! You 
don’t mean to say you’re 
afraid of a little old mouse? 
A big boy like you?” 

“Well, Mr. Bear is — I don’t 
— Daddy ! It is there, honest it 
is, in that hole and it’s hungry 
and it’ll come out in the dark 
and — ” 

“Tommy! A little mouse! 
Get on into your room now 
and no more argument.” 
Tommy’s face began to 
crumple. If he had to, he 

96 



would fight this one out all the 
way — tears, tantrum, kick, 
scream, gasp, hold his breath 
and turn blue — 

“Now, now, Tommy-boy.” 
Daddy did mean well and 
sometimes he was even right 
and so Tommy always did try 
to do what Daddy said. “Tom- 
my, you mustn’t let things like 
that bother you. If we can’t 
catch the little mouse, forget 
it. There’s nothing more we 
can do, so just don’t think 
about it. You see?” 

Sniff. “No.” 

“Don’t think about it, that’s 
all. There is nothing there 
that can hurt you, if you just 
don’t think about it. So don’t 
think about it — that’s Dad- 
dy’s big boy.” 

“Well-11 . And then can 
we sleep with you and Mom- 
ma?” 

Aunt Martha rang in her 
nickel’s worth. “A boy ought 
to be ashamed to be afraid of 
a little mouse.” 

“It’s not — ” 

“Not what?” 

“Uh — it’s Mr. Bear that’s 
afraid. Of the — ” 

“And you just stop that 
nonsense about those ridicu- 
lous stuffed animals, you hear 
me? Nobody should make such 
a fuss about a little mouse.” 
“Momma does. Momma!” 
Tommy let two fat tears trick- 
le down his cheeks, a warning, 
but he meant them too. “Mom- 
ma-a-a, can’t we — ” 

“All right, all right! Stop 
this stupid wrangling! You 

WILLIAM W. STUART 




know how it gets on my 
nerves. For goodness’ sake, let 
him sleep with us tonight. 
Anyway, I don’t blame him. I 
wouldn’t sleep a wink in the 
same room with a mouse. Be 
sure you shut our door to- 
night. Tight.” 

“You’re spoiling the child,” 
said Aunt Martha sourly. 

“Auntie,” said Tommy, “I 
bet you’re chicken to let,your 
door stay open.” 

“Well!” huffed Aunt Mar- 
tha. “The impertinence ! I cer- 
tainly shall keep my door 
open. No mouse is going to 
keep me from getting good, 
fresh air.” 

T OMMY was a very bright 
little boy. Now, with the 
door shut in Momma and Dad- 
dy’s room, and Aunt Mar- 
tha’s door open, he wouldn’t 
think about the Ugly Thing in 
the hole — waiting for dark, 
real dark — to come out — and 
eat. 

“All right, Tommy. This 
once you can sleep with your 
mother and me. Get on to bed 
and mind you sleep quiet. And 
don’t spread those stuff — your 
family all over the bed 
either.” 

“Yes, Daddy. And, Dad- 
dy — ” 

“What?” 

“I won’t think about it now, 
the Thing in the hole.” 
Tommy said his good nights. 
Tonight he even kissed Aunt 
Martha as if he meant it. And 
he took his family and he went 

DON’T THINK ABOUT IT 



to bed in Momma and Daddy’s 
room. 

He did not think about 
the Ugly Thing. He went 
right to sleep, lying at the 
edge of the big, big bed. Tom- 
my, and Old Rabbit, and Ko- 
key Koala, and even Mr. Bear 
went right to sleep. 

Outside the wind blew hard 
and harder and the rain drove 
down and it was dark. The 
television reception was bad. 
Everyone went to bed early. 
Good night. Lights out. 

In Tommy’s room it was 
quite dark with only the faint, 
watery rays of the street light 
on the comer swimming in 
through the rain. In the closet 
there was a stirring, a fumb- 
ling, a tearing and the hole 
in the blackness grew, was 
forced, bigger, wider, as the 
Thing pushed and ripped at 
whatever was barring it from 
the warm, red, oozing food it 
craved ; it must have ; it would 
have. 

And, in a sudden gust, the 
wind blew harder still. Some- 
where in town, blocks away, 
a wire fell and blue sparks 
flashed and crackled in the 
dripping night. In Tommy’s 
house the refrigerator went 
off, the electric clocks stopped. 
The street light blinked once 
and was gone and in Tom- 
my’s closet there was a sud- 
den, mighty surge of effort, a 
break, and something, not a 
sound, but something, a harsh 
and bloody sense or feel of 
rending greed flowing out- 

97 




ward from the closet in a 
wave. 

Aunt Martha, in her sleep, 
said, “No. Oh, no!” 

Daddy interrupted a snore 
with a strained grunt. Mom- 
ma whimpered softly and 
hugged to herself her swollen 
stomach. 

Tommy blinked and was 
awake. Soothingly, he patted 
Kokey and Old Rabbit. He 
squeezed Mr. Bear’s paw. 
Then he slipped his hand into 
the opening in Mr. Bear’s 
overalls and took out Daddy’s 
cigarette lighter. He knew how 
to work it. But first he waited. 

“Don’t think about it,” 
Daddy had told him and he 
didn’t think about it, really. 
But he couldn’t help feeling 
it. The Ugly Thing was out, 
clear out of the hole now, and 
moving. He could feel that and 
the awful hunger moving 
with it. Aunt Martha’s room 
was closest and her door was 
open. Momma and Daddy’s 
room was closed. The Ugly 
Thing moved fast, faster, and 
reached out, thirsting, hung- 
ering . 

From Aunt Martha’s room 
came the quavering wail and 
from the Thing there flowed 
a sense of vicious, evil joy. 

There it was, but was it 
enough? 

Tommy hugged Mr. Bear 
once, tightly, and slipped 
noiselessly from the bed. He 
wasn’t thinking about it, he 
couldn’t, he wouldn’t think 
about it. But he knew what 



he had to do. He had the 
lighter. At the bedroom door 
he worked it. Opened the door 
a crack; thrust it out. And 
then, in a little rush, back to 
bed where he lay quietly, and 
he didn’t think about it, he 
and Mr. Bear and Old Rabbit 
and Kokey Koala. 

A FTER a little, the sense of 
feeding hunger was gone 
and the feel of the Ugly Thing 
was gone, back into the hole 
in the closet, forced back by 
the flickering yellow light of 
the flames started by the cig- 
arette lighter. Then, when the 
smell of smoke grew thick in 
the room and he could hear 
the crackling of the fire burn- 
ing the house, Tommy shook 
Daddy awake. 

It wasn’t hard to get out 
through the bedroom window, 
except for Momma. But she 
made it all right. And Tom- 
my had a little trouble hold- 
ing tightly to each member of 
his family as Daddy lifted 
him out of the window, but 
they made it all right too. Of 
course Aunt Martha didn’t 
make it — how could she? But 
it was fun watching the fire- 
men in the rain from the 
Krausmeyer’s porch next door 
as the house and the closet 
with the hole in the closet all 
burned up together. 

Aunt Martha ? 

“Funny thing,” Tommy 
heard one fireman say to an- 
other the next day, in the sun- 
shine, as they looked over the 

WILLIAM W. STUART 



98 




smouldering ash, “the old bat 
must have been as dry as dust 
inside. Twenty years in the 
department and I never did 
see a body so completely con- 
sumed — teeth, a little bone . 
Hey, get on away from here, 
son! Get along on home with 
you ! ” 

Daddy and Momma said 
Aunt Martha had gone away 
on a trip. Tommy might have 
known pretty well where she 
had gone, if he had thought 



about it, but he didn't think 
about it. None of his family 
did. What for? Aunt Martha 
had had to go away sure. She 
went. All right, who missed 
Aunt Martha? 

Anyway, there were lights 
in all of the closets in the new 
house they moved to and lots 
of room for everyone, even 
baby sister. And there were 
no holes, not even mouse 
holes, in any of the closets.

WHAT’S THE GOOD WORD? 

Non-readers of science fiction boggle at such place or name inven- 
tions as, say, Rxxl for either the future or alien worlds, yet Earth itself 
is a very good example of alphabet-gargling and sense-mangling, not to 
mention telescoping. Considers these instances: 

Lyon was once Lugdunum. Cameracum and Mediolanum (the latter 
meaning “in the middle of the plain”) have been time-abbreviated to 
Cambrai and Milan. If you can connect the Spanish Zaragoza and the 
French and English Jersey with Caesarea Augusta, you have an apti- 
tude that the U. S. Department of the Interior would welcome — its 
toponomy section, in its search for the origins and meanings of place 
names, has a rough task, for many of the names have come down in 
just as unrecognizable forms and the meanings lost. 

Torpenow Hill, in England, doesn’t sound incredible until translated. 
Each syllable was added by invaders or settlers, and each means the 
same thing — so that the translation is Hillhillhill ! Hill ! Greenwich Village 
is almost as bad, for -wich is from the Latin vicus, meaning “village.” 
The Sicilian town of Linguaglossa is “tongue-tongue” in Latin and 
Greek. Yucatan was not the name the Indians called their country; it 
was an uncomprehending “What do you say?” to the queries of the 
Conquistadores. 

Want to bet on how Baseball, Ohio, got its name? You’ll lose. The 
two towns of Basil and Baltimore decided to merge, with each con- 
tributing its first syllable to the joint name. 

Brimaquonx was seriously suggested — and not in science fiction — as a 
name for New York that would combine those of all five boroughs. 
The future name may make that seem reasonable and perhaps even 
attractive. 

Rxxl does sound unlikely because of its lack of vowels. But if the 
Yugoslavs can call Trieste Trst and “a hill full of fog” in Czech comes 
out vrch pin mlh, why not Rxxl?

EGG 



F OR a week now the Siukur- 
nin had hung above the 
hunters’ camp disguised as a 
pine cone. One of the ropes 
holding their tent fly passed 
within inches of it, and when 
the cold evening wind blew, 
as it was doing now, the rope 
hummed. This created a 
masking harmonic that had to 
be filtered out (along with 
many other “noises”) before 
the Siukurnin could concen- 
trate on the vibrations com- 
ing from the figures around 
the fire. 

Already imprinted and 
stored in the Siukurnin’s sub- 
cellular structure was a long 
catalogue of light-reflected 
shapes and vibration mean- 
ings from this place and the 
other places. It knew that

AND 

A Siukurnin is so becoming! 



when one of the carbon life- 
forms moved to the nearby 
flowing liquid, the creature 
was going to the water. (And 
that was one of the vibra- 
tions for the great heaving 
expanse of liquid beyond the 
mountains to the east.) And 
it knew that when one of 
these creatures became dor- 
mant for the night (low vi- 
bration period), that was 
sleep. 

Oh, there were so many vi- 
bration meanings. 

The Siukurnin tried repro- 
ducing the vibrations for 
sleep and water at a subaural 
level, gloried in its growing 
mastery of these subtleties. 

An aroma of coffee and 
broiled meat arose from the 
fire. The Siukurnin listened 




to these for a moment, savor- 
ing the full roundness of the 
vibration spectrum in this 
enchanting place. As yet it 
had not thought of the neces- 
sity for a non-chilitigish vi- 
bration to refer to itself. 

(You must understand that 
when it thought of itself at 
this stage (which was sel- 
dom), it did not think: “I am 
a Siukumin.” In the first 
place, a natural mechanism 
inhibited prolonged introspec- 
tion. In the second place, 
“Siukurnin” is a make-do vi- 
bration — a limited auditory 
approach to the actual 
“term” that is used only in 
communicating with creatures 
who do not hear into the vis- 
ual spectrum, and who are 
not yet able to detect the 
chilitigish spectrum. Since 



this is only a start at com- 
munication, it’s perfectly all 
right for you to think of this 
creature as a “Siukurnin,” 
but you should keep in mind 
that there’s a limitation.) 

B EFORE coming to this 
hunters’ camp, the Siu- 
kumin had spent two weeks 
as a false rivet head in the 
wardroom of a long gray war- 
ship. It had left the warship 
as a coating of “film” on a 
garbage container, and had 
arrived here in the pine glade 
as a length of “wire” in the 
trunk lid of a used car that 
had been sold to one of the 
hunters. 

Between the garbage con- 
tainer and the used car there 
had been several other shape- 
aliases, all characterized by,

solid color and smoothness 
and all difficult to reproduce. 
The Siukurnin looked on its 
present pine cone form al- 
most as a rest. 

Once started on its reper- 
toire of new vibration mean- 
ings f the Siukurnin was like 
a lilirn with a new arabeg, or, 
as you might say, like a child 
with a new toy. Presently, it 
recalled the period on the 
warship. “Now hear this! 
Now hear this!” it chanted to 
itself at a level too low to be 
detected by the figures be- 
neath it. 

Darkness folded over the 
camp in the pine trees and the 
fire flickered low. The upright 
creatures retired into their 
tent. (To sleep, you under- 
stand.) Among these crea- 
tures was one identified by the 
primitive (non-chilitigish) vi- 
bration: “Sam.” 

Now the Siukurnin listened 
to the soughing of the wind 
through the branches around 
it, to the scrabbling of night 
creatures — and once there 
was a figurative scream of 
skunk odor nearby. Much 
later, the Siukurnin defied its 
inhibitions, tried to recall a 
time before the awakening at 
the warship. Only faint fog 
memory came: a sensation of 
swimming upward through 
dark water. 

The effort of memory 
brought the inhibition mech- 
anism into action. Destruc- 
tive hunger gnawed at the 
Siukurnin. It sensed changes 

102 



going on within its structure 
— a maturation of sorts. 

To put down the hunger, 
the Siukurnin imagined itself 
as one of the flying creatures 
to be seen in the delightful 
harmonics of sky above it — 
soaring . soaring . 

But this, loo, became dis- 
turbing because its self-im- 
age insisted on resolving into 
a giant red-gold winged 
thing unfamiliar to these 
skies (but feeling disquiet- 
ingly familiar to the Siukur- 
nin). 

Dawn crystalled the peaks 
to the east, brought stirrings 
that aroused the Siukurnin 
from its reverie. A figure 
emerged from the tent, yawn- 
ed, stretched. The Siukurnin 
matched light vibrations and 
sound vibrations for the fig- 
ure and, in its own way, “rec- 
ognized” the hunter, Sam. 
There were checkered har- 
monics with merging of long 
and short olfactory-visual 
waves punctured by great 
sound-meaning vibrations. 

“Chilly this morning,” said 
the hunter. “Wish I could stay 
in the sack like you bums.” 

From the tent came anoth- 
er voice: “You lost a fair and 
square toss, Sam. Get that fire 
goin'.” 

A connoisseur sense within 
the Siukurnin came to full 
alert. It felt that this crude 
creature carried some su- 
premely desirable element. In 
a sense, the Siukurnin 
“crouched." 



FRANK HERBERT 




The hunter put a hand on 
the fly rope, glanced at the 
false pine cone. “Yeah,” he 
said. “You’ll burn like pitch.” 
He reached up, touched the 
“cone,” felt sudden warmth, 
then nothing. The “cone” was 
gone. He shook his hand, 
looked around the ground, 
back to the tree. Nothing. “I’ll 
be danged,” he muttered. He 
scratched the palm that had 
touched the “cone.” 

“That fire goin’ yet?” de- 
manded the voice from the 
tent. 

Sam shook his head. “No. 
I was going to pick a pine 
cone to help start the fire and 
the darn thing disappeared.” 
“You’re gettin’ old, gram- 
paw,” came the voice from 
the tent. “Better buy some 
glasses when we get back to 
town.” 

Another voice intruded 
from the tent: “Will you 
guys quit your yakking? I’m 
trying to sleep !” 

For the Siukurnin there 
had been an instant of ex- 
quisite languor. Then it had 
felt itself changing uncon- 
trollably, spreading out over 
the hand of the carbon life- 
form, seeping immediately 
through pores, between cells, 
into a vein. It stretched out 
— no more than six cells in 
diameter — reaching . 

reaching . 

A long, thin thread explor- 
ed the length of the vein. 
(You’ll appreciate that the vi- 
brations here were magnifi-

cent in their contrapuntal 
relationship : little hissings 

and squealings and lappings 
played against a superb back- 
ground throb. There were also 
a few moments of delicate ad- 
justment before the leuco- 
cytes ceased their ravening 
attack.) 

I N ITS own way, the Siukur- 
nin danced for joy. Its 
hunger became only a faint 
beckoning: a dim sort of 
knowledge that end-of-hunger 
was at hand. 

And there came a trickle of 
memory from before the up- 
ward swimming and those 
first moments of awareness on 
the warship. There was not 
enough recollection to fright- 
en it with the thought that 
its own little egg of ego 
might be overwhelmed . 
just enough to whet its cu- 
riosity. 

(All Siukurnin are fully 
endowed with a curiosity 
that cannot be inhibited, you 
know. And chilitigish aware- 
ness makes this faculty even 
more potent.) 

The Siukurnin swam, 
crawled, wriggled, elongated 
and squeezed. Down, outward, 
upward. It had to filter out 
part of the “music” around it 
now: wheezings in the great 
air sacs, gurglings and 
sloshings, cracklings and 
swishings. All so distracting. 
One of its elements enwebbed 
the host's vocal cords (“great 
vibrators” to a Siukurnin). 

103 




Another part interfingered 
the speech centers of the 
brain. Cilia reached out to the 
eye surfaces and the eyelid 
veins, contacting the exterior. 

It was distracting at first to 
discover how all the vibra- 
tions were separated by dif- 
ferent sense organs ; then 
temptation became irresisti- 
ble. (Who can hurl blame for 
this?) The Siukurnin coor- 
dinated its contact with 
speech centers and vocal 
cords. 

Across the pine glade a hu- 
man voice shouted: “Now 
hear this! Now hear this! 
Water! Sleep! Fire! Eat!” 

Oh, it was an exhilarating 
sensation ! 

Two of the upright crea- 
tures, the other hunters, tum- 
bled from the tent. One 
called: “It’s about time you 
got . It broke off. There 
was no fire. Only Sam stand- 
ing terror-eyed beside the 
firepit, left hand to throat, 
right hand outthrust as 
though to push something 
away. 

Then Sam swayed, col- 
lapsed. 

In the hospital room, gross 
vibrations had been dam- 
pened to a remote hush. Slat- 
ted blinds were closed 
against raw morning sun- 
light. The bedside lamp had 
been turned off. But there still 
was a soft harmonic reflec- 
tion from cream-colored walls 
that mingled with the even 
hiss of sleep breathing. 

104 



Sam lay on his back in the 
room’s single bed, eyes 
closed. His chest under a 
green humming of blanket 
rose and fell gently. Some- 
where, a pumping motor 
throbbed its obbligato. Dis- 
tantly, stiff little shuntings 
and pantings and screechings 
told of city traffic. Ether 
trailed its solo virtuosity 
through the air, riding on a 
wave of disinfectant. A 
nurse’s heels along the hall 
added an abrupt random 
rhythm that wove back and 
forth . back and forth 
through the other vibrations 
in a way that excited the con- 
noisseur sense of the figure on 
the bed. 

(After all, the long, virtual 
silence of the migration had 
now been recalled. In a sense, 
it was starved for these won- 
derful “noises.”) 

Outside the half-opened 
door of the room, a doctor 
could be heard talking to 
Beverly, Sam’s wife. The doc- 
tor was tall, a beak-nosed 
shape: pink and blond with 
white on white on white 
echoing across the image. 
Acrid little shouts came from 
his hands, clinkings from his 
pockets, and a buzzing of to- 
bacco rode his breath. 

There had been a strange 
dual recognition of Beverly: 
a sense of familiarity with 
her dark hair, soft curve of 
cheeks, alert gray-green eyes. 
(The Sam-memories, of 
course.) And there had been 



FRANK HERBERT 




added to this a pungent ex- 
plosion of perfume-base pow- 
der (still familiar, yes, but 
heightened to an indescrib- 
able pitch), plus a glissando 
of gold necklace on green coat 
on green suit, all played 
against a bright beating of 
gold-bronze buttons. (And 
there was much more, but 
without chilitigish awareness 
in the reader, the effects are 
meaningless.) 

The doctor’s voice carried 
a drum quality as he uttered 
cautious reassurances. “There 
is no doubt that it’s some type 
of narcolepsy,” he said. “But 
there’s no enlargement of the 
lymphatic glands. His pulse 
and respiration are normal. 
Temperature’s up, but not 
dangerously. I’m inclined to 
suspect this may be a reaction 
due to nervous strain. Has he 
been working very hard?” 

“Narcolepsy, narcolepsy, 
narcolepsy,” whispered the 
Siukumin with its Sam-lips. 

Well . they weren’t ex- 
actly Sam-lips now. They 
were much more accurately 

Sam '*° Siukurnin power) Jjpg 

You just have to under- 
stand that single-ego orien- 
tation sets up difficult 
problems in communications 
here. What you would consid- 
er odd and irresistible things 
had been happening to Sam 
and Siukurnin. Cilia of Siu- 
kurnin had gone creeping and 
seeking of their own volition. 
It was now a great thin net 
spread throughout the host. 

EGG AND ASHES 



Wherever it touched nerve 
cells — in brain and elsewhere 
— subtle displacements oc- 
curred at the subcellular level. 
New memories (Sam-mem- 
ories) filtered into Siukurnin. 
And Siukurnin memories, of 
course, filtered back to Sam. 
(This is one of those proc- 
esses that just cannot be con- 
fined to a one-way circuit.) 

T HINGS had gone so far 
that Siukurnin had dis- 
placed the temporary migra- 
tion-ego. And Sam — “he” now 
thought of himself as a kind 
of “needle” at the end of an 
extremely long thread. You 
see, the “thread” was the 
Siukurnin ego-memory-chain, 
its past so ancient that the 
Sam-ego was staggered. 

(If you open up a Siukur- 
nin-past you find that it is 
other creatures stretched out 
to a virtually meaningless 
number. This is a fascinating 
infinity process in which a 
quite satisfactory internal re- 
lationship has been worked 
out.) 

Fully awakened, Siukurnin 
now understood the necessity 
mechanism that had blanked 
out ego-memory-chain aware- 
ness. There is such a tempta- 
tion in the migration period 
to turn inward upon the 
merged multiplicity, encyst 
all distracting processes, and 
just think and think and 
think and . 

You can see how this 
would be a kind of death. 



105 




(Strictly speaking, Siukumin 
do not fear death, although 
they are vulnerable during 
the “flight-of-joy” vector in 
their life cycle.) 

Both Sam and Siukurnin 
were completely merged now. 
Sam-Siukumin (ego-memory-chain 
+*> lay in the meaningful vi- 
bration core of the hospital 
room. Neither “unit” could 
now undo what had happened 
— nor wanted to undo it. Oh, 
there had been some Sam-re- 
sistance at first. Quite nat- 
ural. 

But Siukurnin revealed 
how a reluctant host’s flesh 
could be incinerated without 
stopping the merging process. 
(And there were all those 
memories laid out in the open 
to prove this!) The other 
capture memories were a 
compelling argument, too. 

The process is so drearily 
repetitive — except for the 
new life with its fascinat- 
ing vibration meanings, of 
course. 

And now you know how it 
happens. Not painful (except 
for some initial shocks). Not 
harmful to the host-ego. And 
not to be resisted. 

In fact, this is being writ- 
ten in the hope that the rest 
of you will see (what an odd 



sensory division) how foolish 
it is to resist. 

There’s no point in resist- 
ance. 

You cannot fight the inevi- 
table. 

Besides, you will find the 
merging a very rewarding 
experience. And if you stop 
to think about it, this is not 
the first time your kind has 
encountered us (although 
never before in such numbers 
as our present migration) . 
You do have your legend of 
the Phoenix. According to 
your legend, this was a great 
red-gold “bird” that return- 
ed to Heliopolis in ancient 
Egypt every five hundred 
years (a reasonable Siukur- 
nin-host life span), there to 
be reborn from its own 
ashes. 

Naturally, the flesh of a 
dead host has to be incinerat- 
ed to free the Siukurnin web 
for its “flight-of-joy.” To 
think of the Phoenix as a 
“bird” was somewhat of an 
oversimplification, you un- 
derstand. But we’re sure 
you’ll enjoy the flying sensa- 
tion and the act of creating 
your new egg — especially 
when you view the experience 
with full chilitigish aware- 
ness. END

First he had to know what 
he was, then who he was 
and why he was — but who 
was relying on the answers? 



THE 



H E OPENED his eyes. He 
wouldn’t remember hav- 
ing ever seen humans before, 
but he recognized them in- 
stantly. Nor could he remem- 
ber having seen anything 
before, yet he felt a warm fa- 
miliarity with all that fell 
into view — the light panels 
set flush with the ceiling, the 
gleaming laboratory para- 
phernalia erected around the 
table on which he lay, elec- 
tronic scanners probing his 
mind with invisible beams — 
but, most of all, the two men 
in white lab coats bending 
over him. 

“Clench your fingers,” or- 
dered the shorter of the two 
humans. 

Muscles tightened. Fingers 
clenched. 

“Blink your eyes.” 

A quick reflex action. 




IMPERSONATOR 



The taller man leaned 
closer. “What is your name?” 
Something tripped deep in- 
side. “Paul Chandler.” 

The tall man smiled, but 
somehow the smile never 
reached his eyes. “Occupa- 
tion?” 

Again something tripped. 
“Geophysicist.” 

“And your specialty?” 
“Glaciology.” 

“Your present assign- 
ment?” 

“I have been appointed by 
the President of the World 
Council to head up Project Ice 
Thaw.” 

“Which is?” 

“A program of weather 
control to combat the exten- 
sive glaciation threatening to 
plunge the Earth into another 
ice age. We meet next month 
in New San Francisco to get 



final approval on a plan of 
action.” 

“And if the project fails?” 
asked the tall man. 

“Catastrophe.” 

“Clench your fingers,” said 
the shorter man. 

Chandler could feel the 
enei'gy pulse from his brain 
to his fingers. 

“Blink your eyes.” 

He did so. 

“Sit up.” 

Stiffly he obeyed. 

“What manner of creature 
are you?” asked the tall man. 

Something whirred deep in 
the recesses of Chandler’s 
mind. “A mart,” he said at 
last. But he knew he was not. 

The tall man depressed a 
series of buttons on a master 
control panel. There was a 
rushing in Chandler’s ears, a 
blurring before his eyes. 



109 



The voice of the shorter 
man floated across a gray 
void. 

“Clench your fingers,” it 
said. “Blink your eyes.” 

The odd sensation passed 
and Paul Chandler found him- 
self looking into the eyes of 
Marta Neilson. She half stood 
at the far end of the confer- 
ence table. 

“Are you sure you’re all 
right?” she asked. 

“Just a moment’s dizzi- 
ness,” he said. “It’s gone 
now.” 

Marta, partially reassured, 
sat down again. 

AS CHANDLER poured 
himself a glass of water, 
he studied her clean features 
as he would a mathematical 
problem in topology. Add in 
her blue eyes and white skin, 
subtract her hair pulled back 
in a severe bun and her lack 
of makeup, and she approach- 
ed the Swedish ideal of 
beauty. 

Her natural magnetism 
and physical attractions had 
always stirred an emotion 
in Chandler, but, strangely 
enough, not now. She smiled 
and, automatically, he return- 
ed the smile. 

“Mr. Chairman.” The dele- 
gate from Canada frowned at 
Chandler. “We’ve debated the 
problem of causes for nearly 
two hours and seem to have 
reached an impasse.” 

A lean Britisher pushed his 
chai£ back. “If you were to 

110 



solicit my opinion, I'd say. 
we’d reached an impasse be- 
fore we entered this room.” 

A stocky Russian with 
weathered features shot a 
glance at the Englishman. 
“Was that remark directed at 
me?” 

“I was under the impres- 
sion,” returned the English- 
man, “that we were here to 
determine an immediate 
course of action. My govern- 
ment instructed me to work 
to that end. I do not know 
what your instructions were.” 

“My dear Dr. White — ” the 
Russian began, but Chan- 
dler’s gavel rapped firmly on 
the table. 

“Surely,” he said, “Profes- 
sor Kotenko is willing to con- 
cede that a cold climate is not 
enough in itself to cause gla- 
ciation.” 

“I did not mean to imply 
that it was.” 

“There must be snowfall, 
and snowfall demands a 
source,” Chandler continued. 

“And that source is the 
Arctic Ocean,” the Britisher 
threw in. 

The Russian stood up. 
“Gentlemen,” he said, “would 
you undo a century and a half 
of Soviet weather control? 
Would you destroy the Bering 
Strait Dam and the North At- 
lantic pumping stations?” 

Dr. White stood up to face 
Kotenko. “If it would stop 
that infernal ice sheet, yes, by, 
God!” 

“It is easy for you to talk,” 
ROBERT WICKS 




the Russian fired back. "It is 
not British science that is 
being impugned.” 

“And it’s not Soviet terri- 
tory that’s being threatened.” 
“A tribute to Soviet sci- 
ence,” the Russian replied, 
smiling. 

The Englishman’s neck red- 
dened. 

C HANDLER rapped his 
gavel again. All eyes 
turned his way. 

“We want Soviet and Brit- 
ish science working hand-in- 
hand with the rest of us on 
this project. Anything less 
might spell disaster.” 

A murmur of approval 
greeted his words and the 
Englishman sat down. Pro- 
fessor Kotenko remained 
standing. 

“You have the Soviet plan 
before you,” he directed at 
Chandler. 

“I’ve read it,” said Chan- 
dler, glancing down at the 
document neatly bound in 
manuscript covers. “An inter- 
esting idea — increasing the 
greenhouse effect by adding 
carbon dioxide to the upper 
atmosphere. But the amount 
that could be added would 
only raise the temperature by 
a few degrees. Since snowfall 
increases considerably at the 
warmer temperatures close to 
the freezing point, we would 
only be compounding our 
problem.” 

Kotenko’s features stiffen- 
ed. “The plan also includes 



changing the albedo of the ice 
by coating it with coal dust. 
Not only would this raise the 
mean temperature, it would 
melt the — ” 

“What happenes when it 
snows over your precious coal 
dust?” the Britisher cut in. 

“We are suggesting a con- 
tinuous dusting program.” 
The Russian took his seat. 

“The plan is not without 
merit,” Chandler said. “How- 
ever, we’ve received almost as 
many plans as there are mem- 
bers on this commission.” 

“Why not try all of them?” 
asked the Indonesian delegate. 

“Or, at least, a program in- 
volving several,” Marta Neil- 
son modified. “Atomic heat 
and possibly infra-red radia- 
tion.” 

“We can’t spread our ef- 
forts that thin,” Chandler ex- 
plained to the young woman. 
“Any one of these plans de- 
mands a concentration of 
money and effort such as the 
world has never known.” 

“And one thing strikes me,” 
Dr. White put in. “None of 
these plans hits at the basic 
cause. They all treat symp- 
toms, save for the Canadian 
proposal, which is quite out 
of the question.” 

“Are you getting back to 
freezing the Arctic Ocean 
again?” Kotenko challenged. 

“One X-bomb on the Bering 
Strait Dam,” the Englishman 
said. 

“My dear Dr. White,” re- 
turned the Russian, “the 

111 



THE IMPERSONATOR 




X-factor is best left under in- 
ternational ban.” 

T HE Englishman turned to 
the Canadian delegate. “Is 
it? Perhaps this is the time to 
screen your stop-motion stud- 
ies of the destruction of Ot- 
tawa.” 

“What purpose could that 
possibly serve ?” Kotenko pro- 
tested. “We’ve all seen the 
glacier first-hand.” 

“It might well underscore 
the need for more action and 

“Then,” said the Indian 
delegate, “by all means, let’s 
see them.” Again there was a 
murmur of approval. 

As the delegates rearrang- 
ed their chairs to face the 
view-wall at the far end of 
the conference room, the 
Canadian pushed a button on 
a control console in front of 
him. The room lights dimmed. 

“This study was recorded 
at the rate of one frame a day 
by the Canadian Glacial Con- 
trol Commission. Tonight it 
will be released over the 
World Video Network. While 
everyone has seen pictures of 
what is happening in Ottawa, 
nothing quite so dramatic as 
this has been shown.” He 
pushed another button. 

The wall disappeared and 
Chandler felt he was actually 
looking across the rooftops of 
Ottawa, once the capital of 
Canada. At the edge of the 
business district loomed a 
massive wall of gray ice. It 

112 



was pushing a ridge of boul- 
ders and dirt before it as it 
bore down on the city. 

The scene dissolved to a 
closer view of the glacier. As 
Chandler watched, fascinated, 
the glacier ground the city 
under like a huge bulldozer. 
And still it came on and, for a 
moment, looked as if it might 
flow right into the conference 
room. 

The lights came up and the 
wall became whole again. A 
few delegates swiveled their 
chairs back to the table; 
others continued gazing at 
the wall. 

“Now,” said the Canadian, 
“you can see why our plan 
calls for a dramatic ap- 
proach.” 

“Tilting the Earth on its 
axis is quite out of the ques- 
tion,” Dr. White said. “But 
freezing the Arctic and re- 
moving the source of the 
snow is practical.” 

“And time-consuming,” the 
Canadian added. 

But Chandler wasn’t listen- 
ing. A sudden dizziness swept 
over him. He felt strangely 
detached. 

“I don’t think we’re capable 
of reversing the warm cur- 
rents flowing into the Arctic,” 
he found himself saying. “The 
Bering Strait Dam is one 
thing, but a dam across the 
North Atlantic . .” 

“Then what have you in 
mind?” asked the Russian. 

“How would you react to a 
little suggestion of my own?” 

ROBERT WICKS 




Again all eyes were on him. 
“Suppose we were to tap the 
heat right from the Earth’s 
core?” 

The reaction was dead si- 
lence. Finally the Englishman 
spoke. 

“Mr. Chairman, in one 
breath you suggest the im- 
practicability of damming off 
the waters of the Atlantic, 
and in the next you suggest 
drilling into the depths of the 
Earth!” 

“Surely you are jesting,” 
the Russian added. “Why not 
tilt the Earth, as the Cana- 
dians suggest, if we must lean 
to the sensational?” 

“If I were not acquainted 
with your reputation, Dr. 
Chandler,” the man from In- 
dia said, “I would not for a 
moment entertain such a 
thought.” 

“Possibly,” said the Eng- 
lishman, “you mean pockets 
of magma near the surface.” 

“I mean the core itself,” 
Chandler insisted. 

“Gentlemen,” Marta Neil- 
son said. “As you know, I 
have been working rather 
closely with Dr. Chandler on 
the plans that have been sug- 
gested. However, tapping the 
core comes as a surprise even 
to me. But because I am 
acquainted not only with 
his reputation” — she acknowl- 
edged the Hindu with a nod 
— “but with his ability as 
well, I move that we allow Dr. 
Chandler to pick a committee 
to consider the feasibility and 



the consequences of such a 
plan.” 

“And what sort of magical 
drill is going to accomplish 
this ?” the Russian demanded. 

“The edge of the core is 
1,800 miles down — ” the Eng- 
lishman started to say. 

Chandler rapped his gavel 
once. “I believe there is a mo- 
tion before us,” he said. 

U NLIKE the days before 
the threat of avalanches, 
the tubeway over the Sierra 
Nevada range was not heavily 
traveled. Twice in the past 
year avalanches had dislodg- 
ed the tube, once resulting in 
a number of deaths — some- 
thing that hadn’t happened on 
American highways for near- 
ly fifty years. But it was the 
most direct route to the De- 
troit Glacier Control Center. 

“I’m not sure you made a 
wise choice in Kotenko,” 
Marta said. She sat next to 
Chandler on the rear obser- 
vation deck, occupying Pro- 
fessor Kotenko’s seat while he 
chose to mingle with the pas- 
sengers in the main lounge. 
“Why?” asked Chandler. 
“Well, I’m not much of 
a politician.” She glanced 
around before continuing. 
“It’ll be another century be- 
fore Europe forgets World 
War III. Maybe you thought 
Kotenko’s selection would ap- 
pease the Eastern Union or 
maybe you were simply try- 
ing to get him out of the role 
of principal opponent, but — ” 

113 



THE IMPERSONATOR 




“I picked him because I 
needed him.” 

Marta frowned slightly. 
“Now it’s my turn to ask 
why.” 

“Kotenko isn’t just another 
glaciologist or meteorologist,” 
Chandler said. “His forte is 
pure science — creative sci- 
ence.” 

“But he’s impractical.” 
Marta sat back in her chair. 
“You were the first to point 
out the weaknesses of his 
greenhouse plan. In fact, you 
were rather vehement about 
it before the conference. What 
happened to change your 
mind?” 

Chandler didn't answer. In- 
stead, he stared disinterested- 
ly at the snowy moonlit peaks 
distorted by the curvature of 
the transparent tubeway 
walls. Marta touched his arm. 

“I don’t mean to get per- 
sonal,” she said. “But you 
seem to have changed a great 
deal quite suddenly. You’re 
colder, as if you had lost your 
sense of humor somehow.” 

Chandler met Marta’s gaze. 
"In a way, I suppose I did.” 

“Paul,” she started to say, 
but Professor Kotenko strode 
down the aisle and plopped 
into the seat on the other side 
of Chandler. 

“I’m afraid these were the 
best cigars they had in the 
lounge,” he said, holding one 
out for Chandler. 

"They’ll do,” Chandler said. 

The two men lit Up. Koten- 
ko, through a haze of blue 

114 



smoke, started picking at 
Chandler’s brain like a sur- 
geon undertaking an explora- 
tory operation. 

“Now then, my dear Dr. 
Chandler, what will this 
magic drill be?” 

“I was thinking of super- 
dense metals from Pluto and, 
maybe later, from the depths 
of the Earth itself.” 

“You are thinking in terms 
of conventional drilling?” 

“I have been, yes.” 

Kotenko settled back in his 
chair, his bull neck against 
the padded head rest. “I don’t 
wish to insult your intelli- 
gence by asking if you have 
any idea of the pressures at 
those depths.” 

Chandler rolled his cigar in 
his fingers but said nothing. 

“The drill cores we’ve re- 
moved from the crust under 
the Pacific bear out our math- 
ematics on pressures,” Ko- 
tenko continued. “But heat is 
something else again. There 
will be hot pockets, semi-mol- 
ten strata, finally molten ma- 
terial of great density. We can 
only guess at the tempera- 
tures. Your drill casing must 
not only stand up against fan- 
tastic pressures but also tem- 
peratures that will make the 
toughest alloys run like quick- 
silver.” 

“There have been lab ex- 
periments removing heat- 
conductivity entirely from 
metals,” Marta offered. 

“What is to keep the pres- 
sure from blowing the casing 

ROBERT WICKS 




right out of the molten rock?” 
Kotenko asked. 

“Pressure traps built into 
the solid strata wherever we 
find it,” Chandler said. 

Kotenko digested this 
thought for a moment. “Then 
your drilling must be fully 
automated and not physically 
directed from the surface.” 

“It can be done,” countered 
Chandler. 

“And I suppose you will use 
some sort of thermocouple or 
heat transfer pump to direct 
the heat against the ice.” 

C HANDLER nodded. “And 
pump it into the air to 
raise the mean temperature in 
the glacial areas.” 

“That will cause some un- 
usual weather aberrations,” 
mused Kotenko. 

“Nothing that the weather 
control boys can’t handle.” 
“Are you sure,” said Ko- 
tenko, drawing on his cigar, 
“that the core of the Earth is 
made of molten metal?” 

“I’ve been working on that 
assumption.” 

“There are those who feel 
it might consist of compacted 
hydrogen atoms.” 

“Would it make much dif- 
ference as long as we can use 
the heat?” Marta asked. 

“If we are not careful in 
tapping such a core — ” Ko- 
tenko paused for a moment, 
considering the consequences 
— “we could turn the Solar 
System into a binary system.” 
“I doubt that,” Chandler 



said. “Besides, I don’t plan to 
set off an X-bomb in the 
core.” 

“The immediate problem,” 
said Kotenko, “is to drill such 
a hole.” 

“It will take some real en- 
gineering,” Chandler admit- 
ted. 

“It will take more than en- 
gineering.” Kotenko looked 
directly into Chandler’s eyes. 
“Will you listen to a sugges- 
tion of mine?” 

“That’s why I singled you 
out for the committee.” 

“Forget a drill of super- 
dense metal.” He leaned for- 
ward. “Use a device that will 
melt anything it comes into 
contact with, fuse the mate- 
rial into a casing and remove 
the heat conductivity from it 
so that it will remain solid. 
This device would sink to- 
ward the center of the Earth 
on a gravity drive principle. 
Your pressure traps would be 
force fields — controlled to al- 
low surplus debris to spew 
out the top like an oil gusher.” 
Kotenko settled back against 
the head rest. 

“Where would we get the 
energy to drive this device?” 
Chandler asked. 

“Thermo-nuclear power de- 
veloping heat and thermo- 
electricity.” 

“Then I would be taking a 
fusion bomb into the core of 
the Earth.” 

“Yes, you would. You 
would have to maintain care- 
ful control from the surface.” 



THE IMPERSONATOR 



115 




"And suppose the core is 
made of compacted hydrogen 
atoms?” Marta asked. 

Kotenko blew a long ribbon 
of smoke. “I doubt if there 
would be any danger unless 
we add the X-factor to the 
device.” 

Marta started to speak, but 
an insistent electronic chim- 
ing interrupted. 

“Emergency deceleration,” 
Chandler said calmly. 

Even before the “Fasten 
Your Seatbelts” sign flashed 
on, Chandler, Kotenko and 
Marta had the buckles clamp- 
ed tight and were braced 
against the head rests of their 
chairs. Light beam generators 
whirred. The tubecar shud- 
dered and lurched to a stop. 
The lights went out and a 
woman screamed somewhere. 

“There is no danger,” the 
reassuring voice of the driver 
said over the speaker system. 
“There seems to be some trou- 
ble ahead.” The lights flicker- 
ed on dimly. 

“We are on our own pow- 
er,” Kotenko said. “The tube 
must be out up ahead.” 

“Another avalanche?” ask- 
ed Marta. 

A private car pulled up be- 
hind them and cushioned to a 
stop on their force field bump- 
er. Chandler swiveled his 
chair around and looked 
through the front viewdome 
at the scene ahead. The tube- 
way was illuminated with 
faint emergency light panels 
for about two hundred feet. A 



Greyhound Tubecar and sev- 
eral private cars were stalled 
at that point. Beyond was 
blackness. 

Marta unbuckled her seat 
belt and stood up to see better. 
Chandler gazed up the slope 
of a towering peak alongside 
them. Deep snow glistened in 
the soft reflected light of the 
tube. 

“We have just received 
word of an avalanche,” the 
voice of the driver reported. 
“There is no immediate dan- 
ger. However, we may be 
forced to turn back to — ” A 
sound as of rolling thunder 
drowned him out. 

“What — ” Kotenko started 
to say, and then a gigantic 
mass of snow shuddered down 
the side of the mountain and 
broke against the tube like a 
foaming tidal wave engulfing 
the shore. Marta screamed 
and fell into Chandler’s arms 
as the tubeway lifted, twisted, 
then slid with the snow into 
the valley below. 

I T WAS like the dissolve on 
the video screen. Marta’s 
terror-filled eyes were replac- 
ed by the penetrating eyes of 
the short man in the gleaming 
laboratory. 

“Clench your fingers.” 

Paul did. 

“Blink your eyes.” 

Paul did that, too. 

The tall man turned from 
the control panel and looked 
down at Chandler. 

“That was close,” he said. 



116 



ROBERT WICKS 




“Everything could have been 
lost in that one moment.” 
“Marta,” Chandler mur- 
mured. “What happened to 
Marta?” 

The short man looked up at 
the taller one. “Let’s skip- 
time him three or four hours 
to avoid the possibility of los- 
ing him in the avalanche.” 

“If that doesn’t work,” the 
tall man returned, “we’ll have 
to go all the way back to the 
conference and start again.” 
“I don’t know what this is 
all about,” Chandler said. 

“How could you?” said the 
tall man. “Under your pres- 
ent programming, all memo- 
ries have been canceled out.” 
“What is my purpose?” 
“You know that.” The tall 
man fingered a series of 
switches. 

“Think we’ll have to clear 
him?” Chandler heard the 
short man ask. 

“No, I think we’re just un- 
der the critical level.” 

The short man leaned over 
Chandler and watched closely. 
There was another dissolve. 
The man’s eyes were replaced 
by Professor Kotenko’s, spar- 
kling with alertness. 

‘‘You fainted,” Kotenko 
said. “Like a woman, you 
closed your eyes and fainted.” 
“What about Marta?” 
Chandler asked. 

Kotenko smiled. “She did- 
n’t faint.” 

“Then she’s all right?” 
“Everyone in the last three 
cars lived — a few broken 

118 



bones, that’s all. The tube sep- 
arated and the front cars and 
some of the other vehicles 
were carried down into the 
valley. This would not be per- 
mitted in the Soviet Union.” 

Chandler sat up. He was on 
the floor of a gymnasium. A 
brightly painted poster on the 
wall extolled the virtues of 
the Reno Union High School 
basketball team. Perhaps 
thirty others were on the floor 
covered with blankets and 
tended by doctors and nurses. 

“We were brought in by 
verti-plane,” Kotenko ex- 
plained. 

“How long has it been?” 
Chandler asked. 

“Three or four hours. A 
long time to be unconscious. 
They want to X-ray that skull 
of yours.” 

C HANDLER frowned. “No 
need of that.” 

Again Kotenko smiled. 
“That’s what I told them, but 
medical men sometimes get 
carried away with their im- 
portance in these emergen- 
cies.” 

Chandler tossed the blanket 
from his legs and stood up. “I 
feel fine,” he said. 

He led Kotenko down a 
makeshift aisle between the 
rows of injured. At the front 
entrance, he was intercepted 
by Marta. 

“Where do you think you’re 
going?” she demanded. 

“To the center.” 

“But—” 



ROBERT WICKS 




“No arguments. We’ve got 
a lot of work to do.” 

“You make it sound as 
though there’s no time,” she 
said. 

“There’s much less than 
most people think.” 

“What do you mean by 
that?” asked Kotenko. 

Chandler hesitated. There 
was something filed away in 
the back of his mind, but he 
knew he’d have difficulty ex- 
plaining how he knew what 
he knew. 

“You saw the video tapes of 
Ottawa,” he said. “Montreal 
will be next, then Toronto, 
Chicago, Buffalo, Detroit, To- 
ledo and, at the same time, 
Norway, Sweden, Ireland and 
eventually all of northeastern 
Europe.” 

“Ah,” the Russian grinned. 
“Excellent strategy. Set a 
deadline. Let everyone know 
you are working against time 
and you’ll have much less op- 
position and much stronger 
backing.” 

“What sort of a deadline?” 
Marta asked Chandler. 

“A month to test the feasi- 
bility, then one year to de- 
velop the drill.” 

“I can hardly wait to see 
the faces of the committee 
when we tell them that,” said 
Kotenko. 

B UT Kotenko showed little 
interest in the surprised 
faces of the committee when 
Chandler announced his dead- 
line one month later in De- 



troit. Chandler knew that it 
was another aspect of his re- 
port that deeply concerned 
the Russian. 

Marta supported Chan- 
dler’s contention that the job 
could be done — and in a year. 
She produced carefully de- 
tailed studies of non-conduc- 
tive metals that she had 
painstakingly prepared. 

Finally it was Kotenko’s 
turn. 

“Yes, Dr. Chandler, with 
his rather remarkable mental 
resources, has clearly shown 
that the drill can be produced 
by modern technology. And I 
believe that Dr. Neilson — ” 
he smiled at Marta — “can lead 
the way to a system of non- 
conductive conduits to pump 
the heat anywhere it. is need- 
ed. Only the one hole with its 
inexhaustible supply of heat 
will be necessary. On only one 
point do I disagree with Dr. 
Chandler.” 

Paul Chandler was doodling 
unconcernedly on the edge of 
his notepad. 

“And that,” continued Ko- 
tenko, “is on the need for the 
X-f actor.” 

Dr. White demanded the 
floor and Chandler acknowl- 
edged him without looking up 
from his notepad. 

“For years,” the English- 
man said, “the Russian gov- 
ernment has steadfastly 
refused to agree to the use of 
the X-factor. I can appreciate 
their feeling, since it was the 
X-factor that tipped the 



THE IMPERSONATOR 



119 




scales in favor of the West 
during World War III.” 
“Tipped the scales?” Ko- 
tenko said. “I was a very- 
young boy, but the sight of 
the vaporized cities of Russia 
is burned into my memory.” 
“I believe I have the floor.” 
Dr. White looked from one 
face to another as he address- 
ed his remarks to each dele- 
gate seated at the conference 
table. “If we had been free to 
use the X-factor, we could 
now have reached the stars 
with no need to concern our- 
selves with the time barrier. 
Instead we are virtually con- 
fined to the barren planets of 
the Solar System. Right here 
on our own planet, the X-fac- 
tor could have rebuilt the 
world almost overnight fol- 
lowing the war.” 

“There is an ancient say- 
ing,” Kotenko interrupted. 
“Those who play with fire — ” 
“The time has come,” Dr. 
White pushed on, “to reap- 
praise our position with re- 
gard to the X-factor capsules 
lying unused in the Swiss 
stockpile.” 

“We are hardly in a posi- 
tion to act on that matter,” 
said the delegate from Great- 
er Germany. “This is a matter 
for the Council itself.” 
Chandler tossed his pencil 
aside and stood up. “Nor is 
there any need to get a deci- 
sion at this moment. The drill 
— with or without the capsule 
— will be basically the same. 
I’d like to see a motion for 

120 



work to proceed on the drill. 
The matter of the X-factor 
can be decided later.” 

“I make such a motion,” 
said the Canadian. 

The motion was passed. 

It was Marta who selected 
the site. She chose a grassy 
meadow in northern Michi- 
gan that stood directly in the 
path of the advancing glacier. 
But long before the first fin- 
gers of the glacier could 
search out the site, searing 
billows of heat would spread 
like a spider web across the 
mountain heights and north- 
ern reaches of North Amer- 
ica, the north Atlantic and 
northwestern Europe. 

Only Marta’s stubborn in- 
sistence that this was the 
most central location had 
worn down a number of Eu- 
ropean delegates who had 
wanted operations to begin on 
their side of the Atlantic. 

Kotenko, with a green light 
from Chandler, ordered three 
long-abandoned automotive 
plants into action in Michi- 
gan. Scientists and techni- 
cians from many nations of 
the World Council were 
brought together in the old 
General Motors Technical 
Center in Detroit. Plans were 
drawn, models constructed 
and a test vehicle sent to the 
center of Saturn’s moon, 
Mimas. 

C HANDLER carefully stud- 
ied Kotenko’s report of 
the Mimas probe, then met 

ROBERT WICKS 




with the Russian in the lat- 
ter’s office. 

“I know why you’re here,” 
said Kotenko, offering Chan- 
dler a black Russian cigar. 
“You must take into consider- 
ation that this was only a 
scale model.” 

“But it had full power,” 
Chandler argued. 

“The initial descent was 
held to fifty miles an hour.” 
Kotenko lit Chandler’s cigar. 
“A fast start and we would 
have done it with power to 
spare. And remember that we 
haven’t licked the heat prob- 
lem. The test drill was soften- 
ed by friction heat.” 

“You still couldn’t have 
made it to the center of 
Rhea, let alone to the core of 
the Earth,” Chandler said. 

“It can be done,” Kotenko 
insisted, “and without resort- 
ing to your X-f actor.” 

“I’ye requested a special 
meeting of the World Council 
together with the committee 
to clear the way for using 
the X-f actor.” 

“I’ll oppose it. Since I am in 
full charge of constructing 
the drill, my words will bear 
some weight.” 

“I doubt if you will object,” 
Chandler said. “I’ve just re- 
ceived a report from the State 
Department. They have good 
reason to believe that your 
government will back the re- 
lease of one capsule.” 

Kotenko stared at Chan- 
dler. Finally he rotated his 
cigar in his fingers and stud- 

THE IMPERSONATOR 



ied the burning end. “Then 
I’ll resign.” 

“No, you won’t. Your gov- 
ernment wouldn’t permit it.” 
He smiled at the Russian. 
“And neither would I. You’re 
too valuable a man.” 

Kotenko was still studying 
his cigar as Chandler left. 

T HE X-factor capsule arriv- 
ed under an international 
guard with the blessings 
of slightly over half of the 
member nations. Kotenko 
didn’t resign, but his friendli- 
ness vanished. 

That same day, Marta 
broke in on Chandler and, to 
the consternation of his secre- 
tary, hugged him. 

“We’ve done it!” she cried. 
“Here, here, take it easy.” 
He held her at arm’s length. 
“All right, what have we 
done?” 

“Remember the things you 
said to me about slowing 
down the molecular activity 
of metals?” 

Chandler nodded. 

“Well,” she continued, 
“we’ve just had a major 
breakthrough in the metal- 
lurgical lab, once you showed 
us the way. We can practical- 
ly remove all of the heat con- 
ductivity. In less than a 
month we can start manufac- 
ture of the conduits.” 

Chandler smiled. The last 
obstacle was over. 

“And more than that,” 
Marta said, “we can build a 
test drill that will go down 

121 




into one of the big moons — 
one with a molten core.” 
“The next drill,” said Chan- 
dler, “will be the real thing to 
tap the core of the Earth.” 
Marta kissed him. 

The drill took less than the 
projected year to build. On 
the grassy Michigan meadow, 
as several hundred dignitar- 
ies, reporters and curious 
spectators in wind-whipped 
overcoats were held in check 
by armed troops, the giant 
device was lowered toward a 
concrete basin. Sizzling arc 
lights mounted on the con- 
trol ring, a circular concrete 
building surrounding the 
basin, illuminated the scene 
against the growing darkness 
of night. 

The Soviet press was laud- 
ing the drill as a Russian 
achievement. Most Western 
papers gave the credit to Dr. 
Paul Chandler. But Chandler 
knew it was Kotenko’s idea, 
made possible by his own 
mental resources, surprising 
even to himself. 

Chandler felt a deep pride 
as he gazed at the drill, com- 
plete with the controversial 
capsule. 

“’C'XCUSE me, Dr. Chan- 
dler.” A reporter with 
dry, unkempt hair stepped up. 
“I still don’t see how that 
thing will work.” 

“In simple words, the rock 
is drawn into the bottom 
something like air into a jet 
engine,” said Chandler. “The 



rock is vaporized and expelled 
out the top where the vapor 
together with the device itself 
presses the molten material 
into the walls of the shaft. 
Because the rock has had its 
heat conductivity removed, it 
hardens and remains perma- 
nently solid. A tubular force 
field keeps the shaft from col- 
lapsing.” 

“I understand that much.” 
The reporter took out a fold- 
ed square of paper and a pen- 
cil. “But what makes the 
thing go?” 

“It has a gravity drive, giv- 
ing it many times its normal 
weight.” Marta Neilson had 
moved up to Chandler’s el- 
bow. “It simply sinks toward 
the center of the Earth like a 
pebble sinking in a pond of 
water.” 

“What is your reaction to 
Senator Caldwell’s remark 
that the administration is at 
last returning all of the na- 
tion’s gold into a hole in the 
ground ?” 

Chandler laughed. “Don’t 
get me mixed up in politics.” 

“Are you disturbed by the 
Interplanetary Council of 
Churches’ charge that any at- 
tempt to stop the glacier is 
defying the will of God?” 

“Nor religion, either, 
please.” 

“Then maybe you’ll discuss 
your own field,” the reporter 
said. “Are you aware of the 
petition signed by thousands 
of African and Middle East- 
ern scientists?” 



122 



ROBERT WICKS 




"I’ve read about it,” Chan- 
dler admitted. 

“Do you feel that taking an 
X-bomb into the center of the 
Earth is completely safe?” 

“Nothing is completely 
safe.” Chandler pointed to the 
reporter’s feet. “The ground 
may give way under your feet 
right now, but I’d bet my life 
that it won’t.” 

The reporter studied the 
ground under his feet, then 
scribbled a few words on his 
paper. A moment later, he 
spotted Kotenko and excused 
himself. 

Marta gave Paul’s hand a 
firm squeeze and he squeezed 
back. Dr. White stepped up 
and offered his congratula- 
tions, adding the suggestion 
that perhaps now they should 
turn their attention to de- 
stroying the Bering Strait 
Dam. Chandler parried the 
question and the Englishman 
left to exchange pleasantries 
with the Indian delegate, who 
was engaged in an animated 
conversation with several 
committee members. 

“Well,” said Marta, smiling 
up at Chandler, “tomorrow’s 
the big day.” 

“Worries me,” Chandler 
said. 

“You mean the composition 
of the core?” 

Chandler nodded at the 
drill. “Basically, that thing is 
an X-bomb. If fusion were to 
occur in the core and that 
core were made up of com- 
pacted hydrogen atoms, I 

THE IMPERSONATOR 



think the Earth might crack 
apart along the fault lines 
surrounding the Pacific Ocean 
basin.” 

“What could cause fusion?” 
Marta asked. 

“Losing control from the 
surface.” 

“How do you mean?” 

“Well, it’ll tax the abilities 
of the controllers every min- 
ute,” Chandler explained, “to 
compensate for variations in 
density and gravity. If that 
thing got away from them, 
even for a few moments, its 
velocity could build to a point 
where it would hit the center 
of the Earth’s gravity at the 
speed of a meteor.” 

Marta’s eyes opened wide. 
“And, of course, it would stop 
almost instantaneously.” 

“Most of the energy of its 
forward motion would be con- 
verted to heat, which would 
develop a temperature far 
more than enough to trigger 
the thing,” Chandler said. 

“But it’s made of non-con- 
ductive alloys,” Marta said. 

“Which would only make it 
happen quicker by reflecting 
the heat back in on itself.” 

T HE press photographers’ 
strobe lights began to 
flicker as the drill was lower- 
ed into the center of the 
control ring. Someone was 
making a speech, thin sounds 
wavering across the meadow, 
as Chandler and Marta start- 
ed walking toward the VIP 
geodesic dome, where most of 

123 




the top scientists were quar- 
tered. 

Marta stared at Chandler 
for a moment. “Why didn’t 
you say something about this 
to me, Paul? Now I know 
why Kotenko favored hydro- 
gen fusion without the X-fac- 
tor.” 

“It wouldn’t have done the 
job,” Chandler said. “Just not 
enough controllable power.” 
“Kotenko thought so.” 

“He was wrong.” 

“Then why did you insist 
upon the drill ? Surely some of 
the other methods were work- 
able. What about India’s sug- 
gestion to set off a number of 
H-bombs underground to pro- 
duce pockets of magma? That 
would have produced plenty 
of tappable heat.” 

“I don’t know,” was Chan- 
dler’s honest answer. “Call it 
a hunch or a premonition, but 
I think it’s the drill or noth- 
ing. Once the core is tapped, 
the danger is over; we won’t 
have to drill any more holes. 
We’ll have an unending 
source of heat, and n on-con- 
ductive conduits to pump it 
anywhere on Earth.” 

“Paul,” Marta said, “I’ve 
always gone along with you 
on just about everything. 
Maybe the fact that I’m a 
woman has been outweighing 
the fact that I’m also a scien- 
tist. But let’s talk now about 
the moral obligation of a sci- 
entist.” 

“I’m interested in one 
thing — the best method to 

124 



save civilization from certain 
destruction.” 

“But have you the right to 
gamble like this? Which is 
worse, the destruction of civi- 
lization or the destruction of 
the Earth?” 

“Marta,” he said, “man at 
last stands at the brink of ful- 
filling his destiny. He is al- 
ready establishing colonies on 
two planets and within a hun- 
dred years will have a firm 
foothold in the Solar System. 
In the millennia that follow, 
the Galaxy will be his.” 

Marta stopped in horror. 
“That sounds like Colonial 
talk!” 

Chandler smiled reassur- 
ingly. “In this case, what’s 
best for the Colonies is also 
best for the Mother Planet.” 

“But surely there’s time to 
halt operations long enough 
to try some of the other meth- 
ods first.” 

“If we were to falter now,” 
said Chandler as they began 
walking again, “politicians 
would have most of us replac- 
ed inside of twenty-four 
hours. Would you like to see 
that drill start its plunge to 
the core without someone on 
hand who knows how to han- 
dle it?” 

“No, I wouldn’t,” Marta 
said. “I’m not sure I want to 
see it start at all.” She touch- 
ed his arm. “Paul, this is a 
side of you I’ve tried hard not 
to see. You’re — you’re almost 
obsessed with the belief that 
the drill is the only answer. 

ROBERT WICKS 




And you’re battling ruthless- 
ly against counter-ideas and 
time. After all, even the most 
radical estimates give us at 
least two more centuries. 
Granted there’ll be a southern 
migration, but — ” 

“Don’t ask me how I 
know,” Chandler said, “but 
we don’t have two or even one 
century. We don’t have ten 
years! When the ice cap at 
the South Pole was at its 
peak, it exerted tremendous 
pressures on the continental 
land masses.” 

“The old shifting crust the- 
ory?” 

“Yes. A theory tossed into 
discard when the big thaw 
came at the South Pole. Now, 
at an almost unbelievable 
rate, the ice is building in the 
north. This same seesawing 
effect has gone on throughout 
the Pleistocene. The stresses 
go one way against the crus- 
tal blocks of land, then the 
other way. It might be liken- 
ed to bending a wire one way, 
then the other, until fatigue 
causes it to snap.” 

“And you’re convinced that 
the crust is about to let go?” 
“With catastrophic conse- 
sequences.” 

“You’re asking me to ac- 
cept a great deal on faith.” 
“When you stood by me 
back in New San Francisco,” 
Chandler asked, “did you 
honestly think we could tap 
the core?” 

“I don’t know,” Marta an- 
swered. 



“Would you have supported 
me if I had backed the Cana- 
dian plan for tilting the world 
on its axis?” 

M ARTA seemed lost in deep 
reflection for a few mo- 
ments. “I don’t really know,” 
she said as they reached the 
VIP quarters. 

At Marta’s door, Chandler 
asked, “Will you stand by 
me for another twenty-four 
hours ? By that time, the drill 
will be cushioning to a stop 
exactly two thousand miles 
down.” 

“Unless we lose control,” 
Marta said. “Then, in less 
than an hour, it could be 
smashing into the center of 
the core.” 

“Will you wait?” 

For an answer she kissed 
him on the cheek, then said 
softly, “Now we better both 
get some rest. We start opera- 
tions in less than six hours.” 
She closed her door. 

Chandler entered his room 
and stretched out on his cot 
without taking his clothes off. 
He thought about the plans he 
had ignored. Some of them 
might have done the job. He 
thought of Kotenko, who dis- 
trusted him, and Marta, who 
trusted him. Filially he drift- 
ed into sleep. 

He dreamed of great cracks 
snaking their way down city 
streets, of violent earth- 
quakes, foaming tidal waves, 
of people trapped in crum- 
bling buildings and, finally, 

125 



THE IMPERSONATOR 




the Earth blooming into an- 
other sun. 

And as the fireball expand- 
ed into oblivion, the shimmer- 
ing face of the short man 
appeared. His mouth moved, 
but Paul sensed rather than 
heard his words. 

“Chandler. Kotenko and 
the drill.” 

The face faded to nothing. 

Chandler sat bolt upright 
on the cot. He was dripping 
with perspiration. The drill! 
Something was wrong at the 
drill. 

He ran down the hall to 
Marta’s room and rapped on 
the door. 

“Who is it?” Marta’s voice 
called out. 

“Paul.” 

There was a pause. Then 
the door opened, revealing 
Marta fastening a negligee. 

“Did I oversleep?” she ask- 
ed, yawning. 

“Have you seen Kotenko?” 

“No, but I heard him talk- 
ing to someone in the hall just 
after you left. It sounded like 
that reporter.” 

“Did Kotenko go into his 
room?” 

“I don’t know.” 

Chandler, followed by Mar- 
ta, continued down the hall 
to Kotenko’s room. He knock- 
ed' loudly. There was no an- 
swer. He knocked again and 
shouted Kotenko’s name. 
Other doors opened and peo- 
ple stared out. 

“The drill,” Chandler said, 
and ran out of the building. 

126 



As the door swung closed, he 
heard Marta calling after 
him. He was conscious of 
someone pushing through the 
door behind him as he bound- 
ed across the meadow toward 
the drill. 

A small Army verti-plane 
swung down alongside him. 

“Halt!” an amplified voice 
boomed. 

Chandler stopped and faced 
the plane. “It’s me, Dr. Chan- 
dler.” 

The plane settled down be- 
side him. “Oh, yes, sir,” the 
voice apologized. “We saw 
you running and — ” 

“Quick, take me to the 
drill,” Chandler said. 

“Yes, sir,” said the voice. 

The verti-plane floated 
down beside the massive con- 
trol ring and Chandler, fol- 
lowed by two armed soldiers, 
raced through the main doors. 

“Halt.” 

Guards surrounded them. 

“Has Kotenko been here?” 
asked Chandler. 

“Yes, sir,” replied one of 
the guards recognizing Chan- 
dler. “He took a team of tech- 
nicians to the Gismo.” 

“Follow me,” Chandler or- 
dered, and pushed through 
the inner door. 

Hesitantly, the guards fol- 
lowed. 

D OWN in the basin, Chan- 
dler saw the yellow glow 
of a work light. Figures were 
silhouetted against it. He took 
the spiral stairs two at a time. 

ROBERT WICKS 




The soldiers clambered down 
behind him. 

“Stay where you are, 
Chandler,” said the voice of 
Kotenko, his stocky figure 
back-lighted at the base of the 
drill. 

“What’re you doing, Ko- 
tenko?” Chandler demanded. 

“Removing the X-factor 
capsule.” 

“You’re tampering with 
government property,” Chan- 
dler said, primarily to orien- 
tate the confused guards. 

“I am not going to permit 
the drill to go down there 
with the X-factor,” Kotenko 
said firmly. 

“It’ll never get beyond the 
thousand-mile level,” Chan- 
dler warned, moving toward 
the shadowy figure. 

“I am armed,” Kotenko 
warned. 

C HANDLER stopped. Mar- 
ta, clad in an overcoat, 
came down the stairs. Several 
others followed. 

“Those techs will never do 
it now that they know the sit- 
uation,” Chandler said, mov- 
ing still closer. 

“My dear Dr. Chandler, 
they are citizens of the So- 
viet. They will do as I say.” 
“Put down your gun,” the 
soldier at Chandler’s side or- 
dered. 

“I have already set up the 
drill for descent,” Kotenko 
said. His shadow hand touch- 
ed a black lever on a portable 
field control unit. “As soon as 



the X-factor capsule is with- 
drawn, down it goes.” 

“But you can never main- 
tain control without a full 
crew,” Marta said. 

“I have crew enough,” Ko- 
tenko told her. “Without the 
X-factor, complete control is 
not so important.” 

Chandler leaped for Koten- 
ko, but the Russian’s gun 
blasted white flame. A sear- 
ing pain ripped into Chan- 
dler’s chest. He fell to his 
knees. 

The soldier’s rifle cracked 
and Kotenko’s silhouette 
crumbled against the control 
lever. Electro-mechanisms 
whirred and the drill sudden- 
ly plunged into the depths of 
the Earth, carrying most of 
Kotenko’s crew with it. 

“Good God!” someone 
cried. 

Marta was kneeling beside 
Chandler, tears streaming 
down her face. “Paul!” she 
sobbed. “Oh, Paul!” 

Chandler could taste the 
warm saltiness of blood in his 
mouth. “Get the control crew 
here — quick,” he gasped. 

Someone moved for the 
stairs while someone else leap- 
ed for the field control unit. 

Chandler’s foggy mind 
touched reality for brief mo- 
ments, condensing time into a 
montage. A doctor was work- 
ing on him, then shaking his 
head at the sobbing Marta. 
Lights were thrown on and 
control posts manned. Some- 
one yelled, “Throw in force 

127 



THE IMPERSONATOR 




fields behind it!” And all the 
time Chandler’s chest pulsed 
with pain. 

“Can’t stop it!” someone 
shouted. Then chaos broke 
loose ; men were running, 
blindly bumping into one an- 
other. 

Even though few of them 
knew quite what could hap- 
pen, they wanted to get as far 
away from the hole as they 
could. 

Marta was rocking Paul 
gently in her arms and croon- 
ing something Swedish. The 
ground trembled under them, 
then lurched violently. Sheets 
of broken plate glass rained 
down on them from the con- 
trol ring windows. Chandler 
knew the same thing was hap- 
pening everywhere as the 
shock waves from the drill 
reverberated around the 
globe. 

He looked around. They 
were alone on the basin floor 
except for the contorted body 
of Kotenko. Paul looked up at 
Marta. 

“How — much — time?” 

Marta, her face close to his, 
smiled faintly. “No more time 
for you and me.” Her eyes 
were dry. 

A sound as of millions of 
giant rocks grating together 
welled up from the bowels of 
the Earth. He was looking 
into Marta’s eyes when sud- 
denly everything vaporized 
into blinding white heat. 

"Clench your fingers.” 

“Blink your eyes.” 

128 



T HE short man in the 
gleaming laboratory was 
leaning over Chandler. “We 
did our best,” he said. 

The pain was gone in 
Chandler’s chest. “Marta,” he 
called. 

“I’m afraid she’s gone,” the 
tall man said. “She and the 
entire Earth.” 

The short man pulled off 
his lab coat. “Over a thousand 
years ago.” 

“A thousand years?” Chan- 
dler’s mind fumbled with the 
thought. “What’s this all 
about?” 

The tall man snapped a se- 
ries of switches off. “You ask 
the same question every 
time.” 

“Every time?” 

“We’ve sent you back three 
times now.” The tall man 
traded his lab coat for a tu- 
nic. “Once you tried to X- 
bomb the Bering Strait Dam, 
but the crust shifted, wiping 
out the whole population. On 
the second time pass, you 
tried to tilt the Earth on its 
axis, but it was thrown out 
of orbit and plunged into the 
sun. This time— you still 
have your memories of that.” 
“Makes you wonder about 
fate,” the short man said. 

“But what am I?” Chandler 
sat up with an effort. 

“You,” explained the short 
man, “are a mind developed 
here in a Yenus laboratory 
and sustained in a host body. 
You see, we can’t send solid 
matter back in time, only 

ROBERT WICKS 




waves moving at the speed of 
light. So we send your mind 
matrix to meld with Chan- 
dler’s.” 

“But why?” 

“To help him save the 
Earth,” the tall man said. 
“When it was destroyed orig- 
inally, small colonies of us 
were stranded on inhospitable 
planets. We’re still trying to 
crawl out of the decline that 
set in. But if we can send you 
back and save the Earth — 
well, you will remain with 
Paul Chandler. And we — ?” 
He walked to a bank of con- 
trols near the door and put 
his hand on one. “Who 
knows? None of this will 
have happened. We might not 
even exist.” 



“Now,” said the short man, 
joining the taller one, “we 
will have to wipe out all mem- 
ories for you and tomorrow 
we will start programming 
you for another try. Maybe 
this time we’ll try moving the 
Earth’s orbit closer to the 
sun.” 

“Wipe out my memories?” 
“Of course. We want you 
to function with a clear mind. 
Besides, it’s kinder to you.” 
“I see.” The mind named 
Chandler looked at the two 
men. “But please leave me 
with my memories just for 
tonight.” 

The tall man turned off the 
light. “You always ask that 
and we always do.”

“I NEVER CARRY MONEY!” 

Any extrapolations on the future must take into account the financial 
revolutions in the past and present. Checks (or cheques, to give their 
originators their due) eliminated the flow of great amounts of cash. 
Credit cards of all sorts have brought the process down from industry 
and business and household to all but practically the pay telephone — and 
science fiction writers have extended the system even to that, with fin- 
gerprint and retinal identification, to remove the possibility of fraud 
and incorrect billing. 

But less noticed is the immense job done by B. T. Babbitt, who, in 
1851, stopped selling soap by weight from slabs, and wrapped a litho- 
graph in each package, thus making two important innovations. In not 
much over a century, packaging has become an incalculable huge indus- 
try — and premiums give away or sell at less than cost more than one 
billion dollars’ worth of merchandize a year! 

Thirty per cent of all china ware, 15% of all enamel ware and 10% 
of all aluminum ware manufactured in the U. S. are sold or given away 
annually as premiums, and the figures are rising steadily 1 

Let’s hope it never happens again, but cigar-store coupons and scrip 
were used as legal tender in many towns during the depression. 

It seems like humor right now, but the time actually may come when 
cash will become a museum oddity I
