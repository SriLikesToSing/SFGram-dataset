The history of space -flight 
begins before man. While 
our planet still lay wrapped 
in its dream of isolation , 
other intelligences watched 
from above — minds pure , 
undying, noble — and pa- 
thetically vulnerable . 



“Oh, he is dead!” my mind cried out 



PURE OBSERVERS 

BY B. J. ROGERS 



N OVNA, MY DEAR, I am writ- 
ing this as a release for my 
conscience. Those things which 
trouble me are not such as one ex- 
changes with vigil companions, or 
indeed with anyone not bound by 
ties like ours. 

If I were at home with you I 
would exchange with your soul in a 
moment the feeling of my own, but 
distance permits no such consola- 
tion and it is not suitable for me to 
exchange so familiarly with my 
colleagues. 

I find myself questioning the 
value of our customary refusal to 
communicate thoughts of a delicate 
and sensitive nature. The Earth 
people, who speak their thoughts, 
perhaps are less primitive than we 
like to imagine. They seem to have 
no sense of the danger of over- 
whelming the soul of another with 
unwanted confidences. The purely 
vocal nature of their communi- 
cation does not admit an excessive 
degree of emotion to their relation- 
ships. They do not have to erect 
any artificial barriers between each 
other, as we must who exchange on 
a. mental level. 

These doubts of mine never 
could have arisen if we men of 
Hainos had not presumed to ob- 



serve the alien ways of those crea- 
tures on the third Earth, so like 
ourselves and yet so remote, though 
we have hovered above them, lis- 
tening and watching, for twelve of 
their generations. 

This vigil, though it is to last but 
one journey around the sun, has 
seemed longer and less fruitful 
than all the others. I think I shall 
not come again, but leave such 
work to those who can remain 
efficient and disinterested Observ- 
ers, unmoved by doubt and anxiety. 
Novna, you must begin to think 
what we two shall do with the rest 
of our eternity, for now that I have 
spent some small portion of mine in 
fifty vigils, I find they have be- 
come distasteful. We might go to 
the Palace of Art and study to be 
poet-priests. My last vigil has con- 
vinced me that I am more fitted for 
that life than this. 

When our mission left Hainos for 
the third Earth, there was aboard 
our ship the poet-priest Gven. You 
must remember the many nights we 
sat beneath the rocks by the ocean, 
listening as his soul gave ours his 
songs. Innocent they were, and 
filled with talk of purity and light, 
though Gven is as old as the rest 
of us, even if he is as different from 



3 




you and me as the Earth child is 
from its parents. 

“You have never seen him, I 
think. He is smaller than I, slight 
of build and tender-faced. How 
out of place he looked among the 
ship’s sturdy men of science, with 
their ages of discipline and austerity 
written indelibly into their features. 
They did not want him. They told 
the commissioner that they did not 
want him. 

“Let him stay at home,” they 
said, “and sing his songs to those 
who wish to listen.” 

But the commissioner himself, 
and, I suspect, the commissioner’s 
wife, was as fond as any of Gven 
and his songs, so he said Gven was 
to come if he liked. 

Poor Gven tried hard enough to 
make us like him. He offered us 
the only gift he had, that of his 
songs, but no one cared to hear 
them except me, and I was 
ashamed to say so. In the end he 
was reduced to sitting for hours, 
looking out into the night through 
which the ship bore us, saying noth- 
ing to anyone, for fear of our scorn. 
He would have liked us to tell 
him about the Earth people, for his 
studies at the Palace fitted him 
sadly for a scientific expedition. 

Of the Earth people, however, 
we hesitated to speak freely, even 
among ourselves, for all of us feel 
strongly about them, in one way or 
another. Our exchanges on the mat- 
ter have always been burdened 
with emotion ; and we find we can- 
not share easily our thoughts about 
Earth people, unless we banter 
lightly and say little of what we 
really feel. 

4 



When our long-ship drew near 
the third Earth, we were trans- 
ferred into the round-ship in which 
we were to carry on our observa- 
tions. I could see Gven was limp 
with excitement, but as always. I 
would not exchange with him for 
fear of the others, not even to drain 
off that excess of feeling which was 
to prove so dangerous to him. 

Perhaps he thought it would be 
different, once we had established 
ourselves in our designated area of 
observation. Then we might warm 
toward him, giving him the com- 
forts of our experience. If such were 
his expectations, he was disap- 
pointed. Whatever he gathered 
from us was purely accidental, in- 
formation that we exchanged 
among ourselves as we worked. 
Only in this way did he learn of 
those few bonds we had forged 
with the Earth people. 

It is our custom, as you know, 
for each man to select one of the 
Earth people as his subject. This 
is not part of our work, it is only 
a device to drive away the tedium 
that descends upon men far from 
home and bound to exacting work 
in a confined place. We begin to 
feel quite passionately concerned 
with our subjects, and occasionally 
find it difficult to return to our pri- 
mary concerns. 

For some time I had been spend- 
ing my free hours in the world of 
a gentle old merchant named 
Jacobs. I lived his life with him 
briefly, seeing his wife and children 
as he saw them, going with him to 
his store. His memories were good 
ones, filled with hard work and 
simple pleasures. One day, when I 

B. J. ROGERS 




had left the computing tables to 
prepare for dinner, I sought the 
mind of Jacobs. He was crossing 
the street and as he turned his 
head, he saw the shining lights of 
an automobile just before it struck 
him. I withdrew from his mind in 
a shower of pain and darkness. 

“Oh, he is dead,” my mind cried 
out to my vigil companions before 
I could smother the shock and 
emotion in it. They looked up at 
me, questioning. Then I exchanged 
with them more coolly, “My man 
Jacobs has been killed crossing the 
street.” 

Kcven, the fuel technician, 
reached my mind first. “A pity, I 
lost a subject myself that way not 
long ago. It is a bad death for 
them, poor things. They might 
build overpasses, mightn’t they? 
A pity.” 

It has never failed to unsettle 
me, the way my companions have 
come to accept the idea of death so 
easily. To me it is always a horror, 
unnatural and alien. You cannot 
quite see how it is, Novna, for you 
have never been in the mind of one 
who dies. 

I withdrew for a little while to 
mourn my man Jacobs, for my 
sorrow was not to be shared with 
the others. It was while I sat think- 
ing of the dead Jacobs that Gven 
approached hesitantly and sat near 
me. 

“Is it possible,” he asked, “that 
one can read the soul of an Earth 
man? Could I? Or perhaps that 
would not be permitted to me?” 

His eagerness made me ashamed 
of the silence I had maintained be- 
tween us. “It is certainly possible 

A.D. 1950: THE PURE OBSERVERS 



for you to try, though it cannot al- 
ways be done. You need ask no one 
for permission.” 

The delight in his eyes made me 
forget Jacobs a little. “I may try 
anyone at all?” 

“I advise you to search about a 
little. Don’t seize on the first one 
you contact as a subject. You have 
less time than the rest of us for this 
sort of thing.” 

Gven thanked me shyly and went 
away. Later I saw him sitting at 
the open panels, looking down at 
the cloud-topped mountains and 
sandy valleys over which we circled. 
His face was still and pale as he 
concentrated. 

The next day at dinner, Gven sat 
playing with his food, looking up at 
the rest of us frequently, as if his 
fear of our coldness were contend- 
ing with his wish to open his mind 
to us. I was not the only one to no- 
tice his excitement, but the rest sat 
looking at their plates stonily. They 
liked Gven even less than they had 
at first, and preferred to ignore his 
presence altogether. At last I lifted 
my head defiantly and my thought 
streamed across the table into the 
mind of Gven with such energy and 
violence that the others raised their 
eyes from their food in quick sur- 
prise. 

“It must be that you have found 
a subject. I should like to hear 
about it.” 

At once Gven let his thoughts 
explode in undisciplined profusion. 
The men drew back a little, 
shocked by the unfamiliar impact 
of another’s passion on their 
minds. 

“The very first mind I sought 



5 




was that of a girl who calls herself 
Maria Dolores. Often her mind 
turns in upon itself and she reflects 
like this, ‘Maria Dolores, you have 
behaved badly to your papa today. 
Now you must go and ask him to 
forgive you and give him a kiss . 9 In 
this way she scolds herself for 
small misdemeanors. Her world is 
composed of happy, innocent triv- 
ialities, though as her purity touches 
on them and causes them to glow 
briefly before they are left behind, 
it seems that there are no more 
divine and lovely things in existence 
than those in the world of my 
Maria Dolores . 99 

Gven blushed and paused for a 
moment, then rushed on. “I sense 
that her father and mother have 
barricaded her from everyone else. 
They are strict with Maria Dolores 
and sometimes she wishes she could 
go out to dances as the other girls 
do. But she is not sad for long, and 
goes to gather flowers for the din- 
ner table. She sets them in long 
silver dishes, that reflect the pink 
and red glow of the sunset slanting 
through the window. This pleases 
Maria Dolores and she stands 
watching for a long time.” 

Gven would have said more, but 
all at once Corven, the cultural re- 
searcher, interrupted, looking at 
me. “Noven, what have you 
brought upon us by your curiosity? 
We are being buried in an ava- 
lanche of poetic fancies.” 

After this, Gven sat silent, his 
face burning, and the rest of us 
began to talk of the relation be- 
tween the sites of mines and the lo- 
cations of proving grounds. 

For many days, I watched Gven 



covertly. He no longer seemed to 
care about our rebuffs, nor did he 
show any desire to ask us questions. 
He only sat by the panels, his ex- 
pression withdrawn and intent, 
while the rest of us hustled busily 
and a little self-consciously around 
him. I came to notice a certain per- 
plexity in his face after a time, and 
felt that I should ask if he needed 
any assistance. But I was awkward 
and unsure of myself, so I only 
watched him and said nothing. At 
last he came to me, having built up 
a powerful reserve of feeling that 
overflowed with the more violence 
for having been repressed so long. 

“There is something that is to 
happen in the life of my Maria 
Dolores,” Gven began directly. 

Unaccountably, I tensed and 
tried to suppress the warmth I felt 
toward him. “Well, what is it 
then?” I answered. 

He seemed not to notice the 
strain I was under. “They have 
told her she is to be married to a 
young man whom they have chosen 
for her. She is unhappy, but can- 
not tell them. Now they are making 
many preparations. Maria Dolores 
spends her time with her mother, 
sewing dresses and packing them 
away. Then her mother speaks to 
her of things that frighten her and 
me, things that seem to happen 
when men and women are alone at 
night. She does not understand and 
lies awake when her mother has 
gone, afraid and wondering. We 
are uneasy, Maria Dolores and I.” 

Here, Novna, I must attempt to 
explain the marriage of Earth 
people. While with us marriage is 
the spiritualized union of masculine 

B. J. ROGERS

and feminine natures in one soul, it 
is to them a more concrete thing. 
Their junction is not only one of 
minds, but one of bodies as well. 

The union seems not to be un- 
pleasant for those who take part in 
it, but for us, who so jealously 
guard our bodies from another’s 
touch, the marriage of Earth people 
is difficult to contemplate without 
revulsion. 

I was rescued from having to 
answer Gven by the laughter of 
Corven, who had overheard the last 
of the poet’s words. “Well then, 
poet, if she is unhappy, you must 
take her away, mustn’t you? That’s 
what you want, it seems, to take 
her away to Hainos and make her 
your Gvna.” 

Gven stood up and glared an- 
grily at Corven. “Would it be so 
bad a thing to carry back one per- 
son of Earth? Why shouldn’t we?” 
he flung at the other man. 

Corven turned away in disgust. 
“You know we have no authority 
to intervene in their affairs. This 
is what comes of letting a poet- 
priest meddle in the concerns of 
science.” 

A sullenness came over Gven’s 
face, and he withdrew from us 
again, turning back to the panels. 
I knew he was with Maria Do- 
lores. Though I was uneasy over 
his ignorance, I could not help feel- 
ing relieved that I had not been 
forced to enlighten him. 

My anxiety proved to be well- 
founded. It was only a few weeks 
later that we reaped the results of 
our long-cultivated conspiracy of 
silence against the poet-priest. We 
were deeply engrossed in our work 

A.D. 1950: THE PURE OBSERVERS 



at the computing tables when our 
nerves were shattered by a cry of 
anguish from the mind of Gven. 
In a moment we were standing 
around him, avoiding each other’s 
eyes and scarcely daring to look at 
the man shuddering before us, his 
face in his hands. 

“It is done.” Gven cast his anger 
at us like a stone. “It is as though 
she had been killed. Why couldn’t 
you tell me? You, Noven, I asked 
you. Why couldn’t you have spared 
me this?” 

The men looked uneasily at me 
and back at Gven. Shaken, they 
drifted away, back to their work, 
still ashamed to meet each other’s 
eyes. Gven sat there, grinding his 
fist into his palm, staring straight 
ahead. 

He has been gone for some time 
now. At his request, a long-ship 
stopped for him on its homeward 
cruise. I have not tried to reach 
another subject, nor have any of 
the others. At least, if they have, 
they do not speak of it. We are 
reluctant to attempt any com- 
munion with these creatures whose 
alien nature has been so strikingly 
demonstrated to us. The game of 
Observation itself has become less 
a game, and we go about our work 
with a vague sense of unrest, as 
though the descent of catastrophe 
upon us were imminent. 

Gven gave us one last gift be- 
fore he left. He sang us a song 
that made us want to bend our 
heads to the ground in shame. If 
his songs are bitter now, and if 
there is no innocence in them, one 
needs not look far to find the 
reason. END

ALBATROSS 



He had hunted mud worms 
on Venus, and lions in the 
jungles of Earth. Now he was 
after bigger game — the shin- 
ing beast that flies between 
the worlds. 



BY A. BERTRAM 
CHANDLER 

44nO YOU KNOW what it re- 
\J minds me of?” asked Wilkins 
abruptly. 

“No,” said Layton. “What?” 
“An albatross,” said the passen- 
ger. “A great albatross, following 



8 



the ship for day after day, week 
after week. I made a voyage, once, 
in one of the windjammers owned 
by that crazy squarehead, Lar- 
sen ...” 

“He’s not so crazy,” said the 
mate. “My last long leave. I did 
the same — signed on as ordinary 
seaman — and it cost me plenty for 
the privilege. I never finished that 
voyage either — the ship was weeks 
behind schedule and the Commis- 
sion had to send a long range 
copter to locate me and take me 
off, otherwise I’d have missed my 
own ship. As it was, they were al- 
ready warming up the venturis 
when I scrambled aboard, nattily 
attired in dungarees, jersey and 
seaboots. That’s how I got my nick- 
name — you’ve probably heard it — 
‘Sailor’ Layton.” 

“I was talking about albatros- 
ses,” said Wilkins as Layton paused 
for breath. 

“You were talking about Larsen’s 
windjammers,” said the mate. “But 
never mind — I still have the rest 
of my watch to get through and 
nothing to do bu,t look at the stars 
and that thing out there. And when 
you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them 
all. Still, as you say, there is some- 
thing of the albatross about them. 
Funny, isn’t it, how so many people 
before the turn of the century 
used to think they were spaceships 
from Mars or Venus, or from out- 
side the solar system altogether. It 
wasn’t till we got out into space 
ourselves that we found they were 
life fonns, attracted down into 
Earth’s atmosphere by the release 
of certain kinds of energy. That’s 
why our friend is following us 



now — he’s hoping we’ll fire the 
rockets (as we must, sooner or 
later) so that he can enjoy a free, 
radio-active meal . 

“Just as an albatross follows a 
surface ship, hoping for a free meal 
of garbage,” said Wilkins. 

“The story I heard was differ- 
ent,” objected Layton. “I was told 
they followed surface ships to take 
advantage of the wind eddies 
around the hull, and the super- 
structure and sails; that way they 
can cover thousands of miles with 
no more than an occasional flick 
of their wingtips.” 

“They have to eat.” 

“Fish,” said Layton. 

“Garbage,” insisted Wilkins. 

“Or sailors’ eyes,” said Layton. 
“One of the seamen — one of the 
real seamen — aboard that wind- 
jammer told me a rather horrid 
story. A few voyages back a friend 
of his had fallen overboard. They 
were able to throw him a lifebuoy, 
get the way off the ship and lower 
a boat. It didn’t take them long 
to get to the man in the water — 
but the albatrosses had got there 
first. They’d plucked out his eyes 
and torn his face to ribbons with 
their sharp beaks. Anyhow, this 
sailor, this A.B., had declared war 
on albatrosses from then on. He 
used to fish for them — a strong 
line, a stout hook baited with meat. 
But he never dared do it if the 
Old Man were on deck — the cap- 
tain believed in every sailors’ super- 
stition going, as well as one or two 
of his own. According to him , kill- 
ing an albatross brought bad luck.” 
“What rubbish!” said Wilkins. 
“Yes, isn’t it? As a matter of fact 



9 




that ship — Greta Andersen was her 
name — was lost with all hands a 
week or so after I left her . 

“Coincidence,” said Wilkins. 

“Of course,” agreed Layton. 

They both turned, then, to look 
out through the wide viewport. 
From this angle the sun was not 
visible — only the blackness of 
space, the cold, unwinking gleam 
of a myriad stars. Wilkins had no 
interest in the stars, no interest in 
the yellow planet among them, al- 
ready showing an appreciable disc, 
that was Jupiter, to the satellites 
of which world the ship was bound. 

Wilkins was a hunter. He loved 
the trade, and he made it pay. He 
had killed, or captured — accord- 
ing to the wishes of his clients — 
the giant mud worms of the Ven- 
erian swamps, the vicious sand 
tigers of the Martian desert. He 
had gone as far afield as Pluto to 
bring back to the Museum of the 
Institute of Extra-Terran Biology 
the only specimen of the dominant 
life form of that frigid world — one 
of the so-called “glass scorpions” 
— ever to be seen in captivity. That 
it did not live for long in its tank 
at the museum was not Wilkins’ 
fault — he had warned the curator 
that light would kill the beast just 
as surely as would heat, and the 
curator had been fool enough to al- 
low the press all the light they 
wanted for their cameras. 

But here, he thought, as he 
looked out through the viewport, 
is something that can take all the 
radiation we care to throw at it 
and thrive. But what is it? (I sup- 
pose they’ll find out after I get 
this specimen back . .) A swirl, 

10 



an eddy of charged gas — or a 
vortex of pure energy? And how 
did they ever come to call a thing 
like that a saucer ? 

“He must be hungry,” said Lay- 
ton, breaking into his thoughts. 
“That’s all of six days, ship’s time, 
that he’s followed us now. When 
do you intend to try to capture 
him?” 

“There’s no point in delaying 
much longer,” Wilkins said. “He 
might sheer off. I’ve been studying 
him, as you know, trying to decide 
what makes him tick. I’m no closer 
now than ever I was, and there’s 
nothing in the books as a guide. 
When there is, it’ll be I who’ve 
written it.” 

“What weapon will you use?” 
asked the Mate. 

“The one I showed you. The 
energy pump gun.” 

“You’re going to pump energy 
into the beast? I should think it 
would like that.” 

“No, no. The pump gun draws 
energy out of whatever the beam 
hits. I’m going to stun him by 
draining his energy.” 

“Hm. It does seem odd, enough, 
doesn’t it? A weapon generally 
kills, or stuns, by pumping energy 
into the victim — kinetic energy of 
a bullet, or chemical energy re- 
leased by one kind of explosion, or 
the binding energy released by an- 
other kind.” 

“But suppose your target lives 
on energy?” asked Wilkins. 

“Don’t we all,” countered the 
mate, “directly or indirectly?” 
“Indirectly. We don’t take our 
energy neat. We use solar power, 
it is true, but it’s been well proc- 

A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




essed by the time that it gets into 
our mouths and bellies.” 

“Talking of solar power,” said 
Layton, “why doesn’t that thing 
out there live on it? It — or its an- 
cestors — must have done so before 
we started throwing energy away 
on such a lavish scale.” 

“Reverting to sea voyages,” re- 
plied Wilkins, “consider the shark 
and the albatross. Both of them 
managed to subsist quite well be- 
fore man started crossing the ocean 
in his ships. Neither of them 
starved — and yet each of them ac- 
quired the taste for ship’s garbage. 
Then, getting away from the sea, 
there’s the clothes moth. Its an- 
cestors must have been carrion 
caters at one time, living on the fur 
of dead animals.” 

“Could be,” agreed Layton after 
a few seconds’ reflection. “Could 
be . The energy that we throw 
out has been . processed, and 
in the processing has acquired a 
new and attractive flavor . .” 
“That’s the way of it,” said Wil- 
kins. “At least — that’s what I 
think.” He stared out of the port at 
the thing that could have been, 
save for its fluctuating outline and 
shifting colors, a miniature spiral 
nebula. “Well, Layton, there’s my 
tiger. All that remains now is to 
stake out the goat, wait until he 
comes in to take the bait — and 
then get him.” 

“He was an albatross,” said Lay- 
ton, “and now he’s a tiger . But 
you’re the expert. What are you 
going to use for bait?” 

“The obvious thing. Energy. I’ve 
already talked it over with Cap- 
tain Jones. I’m going out in a

will sense it and come in to feed — 
and I get him. I hope. I don’t know 
what will be left after my gun has 
drained him.” 

“When do you intend to use it?” 
“I’ll make it tonight,” said Wil- 
kins. “Faithful Freddy might get 
tired of hanging around — and it 
could be weeks, at least, before the 
next one picks us up. I’ll see the 
captain right after dinner.” 

“As long as somebody lets me 
know. I’m only the mate, but I like 
to be kept informed of what’s going 
on. Ah, here’s the second. Must be 
almost dinner time now.” 

“Relieve the watch, sir?” asked 
the second officer. 

“The pleasure,” replied Layton, 
“is all mine.” He waved a hand 
vaguely at the instrument board. 
“As you see, falling free. One sau- 
cer keeping station at three o’clock 
ahead — and little he knows what 
is going to happen to him within a 
couple of hours. Tonight’s the 
night that Mr. Wilkins uses his 
fancy cannon.” 

“That should be worth watch- 
ing,” said the second. 

“I hope so,” the hunter said. 
“Come on down,” said the mate. 
“We’ve time for a blue gin before 
dinner — and as it’s been the sur- 
geon’s turn in the galley today wc 
shall probably need it!” 

ILKINS CARRIED his own 
spacesuit — it was lighter and 
less rugged than the standard mod- 

11 





el, and the sacrifice of armor was 
more than compensated for by the 
increased ease of movement. He 
put it on in the privacy of his cab- 
in, all but the gloves and helmet, 
and then, as was his habit, re- 
garded himself carefully in the full- 
length mirror. All seemed to be in 
order. 

His eyes strayed from the in- 
spection of his suited body to that 
of his face. 

He thought, You carry your 
years well, Hugh my boy. You look 
hardly older than you did when 
you went out for your first lion — 
and that was all of twenty years 
ago. There’s a touch of gray in 
that carroty thatch of yours, and 
the plastic surgeons weren’t able 
to do much about that scar down 
the left side of your face — but 
you’ve worn remarkably well, con- 
sidering. And the best part of it 
is that you get as much kick out 
of every new hunt as you did from 
the first. 

He opened the locker beside his 
bunk, took out, one by one, the 
three cartridges, handling them 
with a slowness that was not al- 
together due to the great care that 
he was exercising. Each cartridge 
was no bigger than a table tennis 
ball — but each was enormously 
massive. He packed them into the 
pouch at his belt, then fastened on 
the tightly rolled electronic net in 
which he hoped to catch the 
stunned beast, and draw it into the 
specially prepared room aft. 

He pulled himself out of his 
cabin and along the alleyway to 
the airlock. The captain was there, 
and the mate, and a half dozen of 



the other officers. They were look- 
ing curiously at the gun, which one 
of the cadets was holding. 

It was not large. It was no longer 
than the high-powered rifle that 
Wilkins had used on the Venerian 
mudworms. But it was bulky and 
cumbersome around the stock, and 
its barrel flared out to a bell. 

“He’s still there,” said Captain 
Jones. “I’ve just come from control. 
He’s still there. Will you helmet 
up? You can test your suit radio 
with the officer of the watch.” 

“We’d better get back to control 
ourselves, sir,” suggested Layton. 
“The second officer can look after 
the door.” 

“Yes, Mr. Layton. It’d be a pity 
to miss anything.” Jones took Wil- 
kins’ hand in his. “Good luck.” 

“Thank you, captain,” replied 
the hunter. 

He shook hands with the mate, 
but did not trouble to watch the 
two officers depart for the con- 
trol room. He put on his helmet, 
then his gloves. He tested his suit 
radio. Assisted by the cadet, he 
slung the energy pump gun over 
his shoulder. 

It was rather cramped in the 
airlock — it had never been designed 
for the use of men carrying large 
and clumsy weapons. Wilkins had 
foreseen this — that was why he was 
deferring the loading of the gun 
until he got outboard; there was 
always the chance that a sudden 
jar might set it ofT. Wilkins stood 
there patiently, the magnetic soles 
of his boots holding him to the 
deck, watching the needle of the 
gauge creeping back against the il- 
luminated dial. As the pressure 



12 



A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




dropped he flexed his arms and 
legs — found, as he had expected, 
that the joints of his suit were in 
perfect order. When the outer door 
opened he was ready. 

Cautiously, he made his way out 
of the ship. He stooped and clipped 
the end of his lifeline to the ring- 
bolt just outside the airlock. He 
straightened, and looked forward. 
The space beast was still there, still 
keeping station on the ship abeam 
of the control room. 

He was not happy as he made 
his slow, careful way aft. The ship 
was so small — a mere silver needle 
floating in immensity. He was so 
small — a microbe on the surface 
of the needle. He told himself that 
he was exposed to far less risk than 
he had been during his last hunt, 
the expedition to capture a Plu- 
tonian glass scorpion. He told him- 
self that then he had been really 
alone, that if anything had gone 
wrong it would have taken the 
other members of the expedition 
days to find him, and that help, 
inevitably, would have come too 
late. Here, crawling along the outer 
skin of the ship, help was only 
minutes away. 

“Wilkins,” crackled Captain 
Jones’ voice from the helmet 
speaker, “how does it go?” 

“Fine, captain,” replied Wilkins. 
“I’m almost at the tail now. I’ll let 
you know when to fire the rockets.” 

The huge fin loomed before 
him — gleaming, yet dark against 
the stars, the shrunken sun. Wil- 
kins found another eyebolt without 
any difficulty — at his suggestion 
these fittings had been painted 
white — and snapped the spring 

A.D. 2050: ALBATROSS 



hook at the end of his second life- 
line to it. He looked forward. The 
energy being was still there. 

“Will you fire the rockets now, 
sir?” asked Wilkins. 

“Are you secure?” 

“All secure, captain.” 

“Good. Stand by for firing. I 
shall fire on the count of ten.” 
“Thank you.” 

“One . two . .” 

I hope the thing doesn’t come 
aft too fast, thought Wilkins. But I 
should have time. I’ve practiced un- 
slinging, loading and aiming this 
gun enough times, and I’d be a fool 
to have it unslung and in my hands 
when the ship starts accelerat- 
ing. 

“Five ... six . .” 

I hope the lifeline holds, he 
thought. But there’s no danger. All 
the acceleration will do is press 
me back against the fin. 

“Eight . nine . ten ! 33 
The acceleration was gentle, no 
more than a nudge. Wilkins felt 
the reassuring pressure of the base 
of the fin against his back as he 
unslung the gun with deft hands, 
took a cartridge from its pouch 
and slipped it into the breech. He 
did not look behind him — his at- 
tention was focused on the target. 
If he had looked behind he would 
have seen that the bight of his 
second lifeline — he had allowed far 
too much slack — had sagged direct- 
ly into the incandescent exhaust. 

Swiftly, hungrily, the glowing 
disc swept aft. Wilkins’ gun fol- 
lowed it. There was no need for 
him to use the sights — the target 
was too near, too big. Wilkins 
pressed the trigger. 

13 




T HE RECOIL took him by sur- 
prise. He had expected to be 
knocked backwards — and the vi- 
cious, forward tug of the gun pulled 
him off balance. He did not let 
go the weapon, but clung to it 
grimly. The magnetized soles of 
his boots broke contact with the 
hull and he found himself spinning 
out into emptiness. 

He heard Jones’ shout, “Wilkins! 
Your second lifeline has parted! 
You let it get into the exhaust!” 
“How’s my first one?” he de- 
manded. 

“It’ll hold!” 

“It’d better. What’s happened to 
the target? I can’t see a thing the 
way I’m spinning round!” 

“It’s still there — b u t you 
wounded it, I think. The colors 
are fading, the light is dying . 
But it’s still alive.” 

I have to get it, thought the 
hunter. I have to finish it. I can’t 
let it go drifting off into the dark- 
ness, maimed and suffering. 

He ignored the dizzying whirl 
of ship and sun and stars, concen- 
trated on ejecting the used cart- 
ridge. The scientists at the Institute 
had been insistent that he bring 
back all expended ammunition. 
The spent charge he put back into 
the pouch. He reloaded the gun. 

A jerk told him that he had 
reached the end of the first life- 
line. Holding the gun in his right 
hand, he grasped the line with his 
left, tried to check his motion. He 
was only partially successful. 

Even so, the stars were now 
stars — points and not undulant rib- 
bons of light. The ship swam into 
his field of view — the ship and, 

14 



close alongside her. the slowly 
pulsating, waning disc of pallid 
flame. 

The hunter put the gun to his 
shoulder, fired again. He was ready, 
this time, for the reversed recoil, 
but not for the vibration, for the 
sudden heat that burned his hands 
even through the gloves of his suit. 
He threw the gun from him, 
towards the ship. It was the best 
thing he could have done, as it 
happened — the reaction slowed 
him down just sufficiently to allow 
him to fall against the metal hull 
without breaking every bone in his 
body. He was stunned and badly 
bruised, and it was all of ten 
minutes before he had recovered 
sufficiently to whisper into his hel- 
met microphone; but he was alive. 

“Captain Jones,” he said shakily. 
“Captain Jones!” 

There was no reply. 

“Layton!” he cried. “Layton! 
Can you hear me?” 

The helmet speaker was dead. 

And so is the set, he thought. 
It’s robust — but not robust enough 
to stand a battering like the one it 
just got. Even so — they must have 
seen what happened. They might 
have sent somebody out to fetch 
me in. 

He got both hands on the life- 
line, pulled in the slack. Hand 
over hand he hauled himself over 
the smooth surface of the hull until 
he had reached the airlock door. 
There was something wrong — the 
light had been burning in the little 
compartment when he left the ship; 
it was out now. 

He pulled himself into the air- 
lock. He waited patiently for the 

A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




outer door to close. He shouted in- 
to his useless helmet microphone. 
He managed to wedge his back 
against the frame of the outer door, 
and kicked the inner door with his 
heavy boots. 

Fear he had known before — but 
no fear like the dread that para- 
lyzed him now. He knew what he 
would find when he got inside the 
ship. 

Almost he decided to kick him- 
self out through the open door. It 
was stubbornness rather than hope 
that set him, at last, to the awk- 
ward task of manually closing the 
outer airlock door. 

He managed it by making the 
end of his lifeline fast to the wheel 
that controlled the great disc, by 
making himself fast to the cor- 
responding wheel on the inner 
door. When at last he got the door 
shut, the inside of his suit was 
streaming with perspiration. He 
cast off the lashings, turned the 
wheel — it was reluctant under his 
gloved hands — and sealed the 
outer hull of the ship. 

By the light of the lantern built 
into the breastplate of his suit, he 
located the manually operated air 
valve. He opened it, looked at the 
intakes for the puffs of frozen 
moisture and gas that would tell 
him that the little compartment 
was being flooded. Nothing hap- 
pened. He turned his attention to 
the pressure gauge. The needle was 
on zero — and it stayed there. 

Wilkins doubted that he would 
have the strength to force open the 
inner door against the pressure of 
the air inside the ship — but he had 
to try it. The wheel turned easily 

A.D. 2050: ALBATROSS 



enough, and the door opened 
through about twenty-five degrees, 
then jammed on something. 

The hunter braced his back 
against the outer door, lifted his 
legs and pushed with his feet. Slow- 
ly the door moved — through an- 
other ten degrees. There was space 
enough for the man to squeeze 
through. 

He saw what had jammed the 
door. It looked like a mass of icy 
snow. It was snow — but a snow 
whose constituents were solid oxy- 
gen and nitrogen and carbon di- 
oxide as well as frozen water vapor. 

Wilkins knew that in his eager- 
ness to shoot the space beast, he 
had swept the ship with the beam 
of the energy pump gun. He knew 
what he would find — the bodies of 
the crew at their stations, the dead 
machines. He was not prepared, 
even so, for the absolute deadness 
of the ship. He had seen dead 
men before — but none so dead as 
these. It was not that corruption 
had set in (but a putrefying corpse 
is literally crawling with life) — 
that would be absolutely impos- 
sible unless the interior of the ship 
were warmed and the air thawed 
and the bacteria of decay released 
from his own body. It was that all 
the dead men were . drained. 
More had gone from them than 
life. More had gone from them 
than heat. More had gone from 
poor Layton (Wilkins was now in 
the control room) than his verbosi- 
ty, than his hopes of a ferryman’s 
job in the Martian system. More 
had gone from Captain Jones than 
the cock-sparrow jauntiness of the 
little man. They were like wax 

15 




dummies, and not very convincing 
ones at that. It was as though they 
had never been alive. 



W ILKINS WONDERED what 
had happened to the gun 
that he had thrown from him, to 
the weapon that now contained in 
its expended cartridge all the en- 
ergy that had been in the ship — 
the lives of pile and storage bat- 
teries, of men and micro-organ- 
isms, of the algae in their tanks, 
of the yeasts in their vats, of the 
surgeon’s Siamese cat and the chief 
engineer’s aquarium of Venerian 
rainbow fish. 

He reproached himself for his 
almost instinctive action in throw- 
ing away the gun — had he kept it 
he might, somehow, have restored 
life to the ship, to his shipmates — 
or, more possibly, the scientists of 
the Institute might have done so. 

Perhaps the gun was not irre- 
trievably lost. 

It was this forlorn hope, the slim 
chance that the results of his own 
criminal carelessness might be un- 
done, that stirred in him thoughts 
on the subject of his own survival, 
his own rescue. 

He knew of the life-saving serv- 
ice maintained by the Terran 
Space Navy, he had been told of 
the little ships swinging in their 
lonely orbits around the sun, ready 
to respond instantly to a call for 
help. He had been shown the 
emergency transmitter by Layton 
and had been taught how to oper- 
ate it. 

He left the control room. He 
pulled himself through the alley- 

16 



ways— the beam of his lamp falling 
upon the crystals of frozen air, the 
dead men — and into the axial 
shaft. The transmitter was amid- 
ships, in the safest part of the ship. 
All that Wilkins had to do was to 
press the starting button. He 
pressed it — then cursed as he re- 
alized that the batteries were dead. 

He thought again of the gun, 
with its load of precious energy, 
tumbling through the emptiness of 
space. He thought, suddenly, of the 
used cartridge in the pouch at his 
waist. With unsteady fingers he 
brought it out, stared at the little, 
gleaming ball. Power was there, the 
life-force of the thing that he had 
likened to an albatross. Power was 
there, energy that, if released, 
might save his life He pushed the 
cartridge into a mass of frozen air 
that bulged, like some grotesque 
stalagmitic formation, from the 
wall of the shaft. He pulled from 
his belt the axe that he always 
carried. 

His first blow ruptured the cas- 
ing, and the reaction slammed him 
back against the wall of the shaft. 
His second blow broke the shell. 
Nothing happened. Desperately, he 
beat at the little sphere until it 
was no more than a crumpled, 
shapeless mass. 

Suddenly the cartridge came 
alive and the ice around it melted, 
puffing into a cloud of vapor. Sud- 
denly it glowed, expanded' into a 
whirling disc of pale fire. Sudden- 
ly there was life again in the ship 
— an alien life, not hostile yet, 
somehow, frightening. Wilkins tried 
to throw himself backwards as 
tendrils of cold flame brushed his 

A. BERTRAM CHANDLER 




helmet. He shouted. 

The space-thing swirled and ed- 
died in the narrow confines of the 
axial shaft, like a huge butterfly 
beating itself against the hard 
transparency of a window. And 
then, suddenly, it was gone — and 
with its going the emergency lights 
came on, and the pilot lights on 
the panel of the emergency trans- 
mitter. Even through his helmet 
Wilkins could hear the hiss and 
crackle of thawing air. 

I’ve done all I can do, thought 
the hunter. But have I? No. I must 
go to the control room and turn 
off the lights, the heaters. I must 
stay in my suit. I must regard the 
ship as a giant deep freeze, the 
contents of which must be saved 
from decay until such time as they 
can be restored to life. 

But it might well be, he knew, 
weeks before the arrival of the 
rescue ship, and to attempt to live 
in a suit for such a length of time 
would be a protracted, filthy and 
miserable means of suicide. 

In the end he decided on a com- 
promise; he was able to operate 
the manual controls of the air- 
tight doors and seal off a short 
section of alleyway, with cabins 
and a bathroom. The cabins, 
luckily, were empty — their oc- 



cupants had been watching his last 
hunt from the big viewports in the 
lounge. 

Here, then, was his litde oasis 
of light and relative warmth and 
atmosphere that grew fouler with 
every passing day, in spite of the 
efficient little air purifier that he 
had taken from his suit. 

Here was the place where he lay, 
strapped to his bunk, and brooded. 
Here was where he tried to read — 
he had never been a reading man 
— the books that had belonged to 
the owner of one of the cabins. 

He had never been a reading 
man, although he had, now and 
again, usually during periods in 
hospital whilst recovering from a 
mauling, read novels of the trashier 
kind. Poetry was new to him — and 
there was nothing but poetry for 
him to read. Some of it, he had to 
admit, had a message for him — 
one poem in particular, one by a 
man called Coleridge, had a mes- 
sage. 

He was reading the poem for 
the fourteenth time when he heard 
the clang of magnetic grapples on 
the hull.

The ship went out safely, came back safely. The pilot was un- 
aware of anything wrong. Somewhere in the depths of his brain 
was locked the secret that made him 



MAN ALONE 



HOENIX I belled out smooth- 
ly in the region of a G-type 
star. There was a bright flare as 
a few random hydrogen atoms 
were destroyed by the ship’s sud- 



den appearance. One moment 
space had been empty except for 
the few drifting atoms, and the 
next — the ship was there, squat 
and ugly. 




18 




Inside, a bell chimed sweetly, 
signalling the return to a universe 
of mass and gravitation and a 
limiting velocity called C. , Colonel 
Richard Harkins glanced briefly 
out his forward port, and saw no 
more than he had expected to see. 

At this distance the G-type star 
was no brighter or yellower than 
many another he had seen. For 
a man it might have been hard to 
tell which star it was. But the ship 
knew. 

Within one of the ungainly bulges 
that sprouted along the length of 
Phoenix 1, a score of instruments 
mindlessly swung to focus their re- 
ceptors on the nearest body of star- 
mass. 

Harkins leaned contentedly back 
in the padded control seat and 



watched while the needles gradual- 
ly found their final position on 
dials. A few scattered lights 
bloomed on the console ahead of 
him. He grunted once with satisfac- 
tion as the thermoneedle steadied 
at 6,000° C. After that he was 
silent. 

He leaned forward and flipped 
up two switches, and a faint sound 
of a woodpecker came into the con- 
trol room as the spectrograph 
punched its data on a tape. The 
end of the tape began to come out 
of a slot. Harkins tore it off when 
the spectrograph was finished with 
it, threaded it on the feeder spool 
of the ship’s calculator, and in- 
serted the free end in the input 
slot. 

The calculator blinked once at 



19 



him, as if surprised, and spat out 
a little card with the single word 
SOL neatly printed in the center. 

Harkins whistled softly to him- 
self, happily. / had d true wife but 
I left her , he whistled. Old song. 
Old when he first heard it. Had a 
true . 

He wondered vaguely what a 
‘wife” was, but decided it prob- 
ably didn’t matter. Had a true 
wife but 1 left her , he whistled. 

He was glad to be home. 

The direction finder gave him a 
fix on Earth and he tried to iso- 
late the unimportant star from the 
others in the same general direc- 
tion, but he couldn’t do it, visual- 
ly. The ship would do it, though, 
he wasn’t worried about that. He 
wished he could use the Skipdrive 
to get a little closer. It would take 
a long time to get in close on the 
atomic rockets. Several days, may- 
be. 

Well, he had to do it. The Skip- 
drive wasn’t dependable in mass- 
space. You couldn’t tell what it 
was goipg to do when you got it 
too close to a large mass. He’d 
have to go in on the chemical. 

Mass-space , he thought. Molas- 
ses-space, I call it. 

Too slow, everything too slow, 
that was the trouble. 

Reluctantly he switched off the 
Skipdrive’s complacent purr. The 
sudden lack of noise in the cabin 
made him squint his eyes, and he 
thought he was going to get a 
headache for some reason. Abrupt- 
ly, all the cabin furniture seemed 
very harsh and angular, distorted 
in some strange way so as to be 
distinctly irritating to him. He 

20 



brushed his foot across the deck 
and the sound of his boot was 
rasping and annoying. 

He didn’t like this space much. 
It wasn’t soft, it wasn’t restful, it 
was all full of clutter and junk. He 
grimaced with distaste at the sud- 
denly ugly console. 

He looked down at the floor, 
frowning, pinching his nose be- 
tween thumb and forefinger, flirt- 
ing with the idea of turning the 
drive back on. 

But for some reason he couldn’t 
quite think of at the moment, he 
couldn’t do that. He frowned more 
severely, but it didn’t help; he still 
couldn’t think of the reason he 
couldn’t do it. That headache was 
coming on strong, now. He’d have 
to take something for it. 

Well, well, he thought resignedly. 
Home again, home again. 

He was sure he was glad to be 
home. 

Home is the hunter, home from 
something something . 

He couldn’t remember any of 
the rest. What the hell was a 
hunter, anyway? They irritated 
him, these nonsense songs. He 
didn’t know why he kept thinking 
about them. Hunters and wifes. 
Nonsense. Babble. 

He keyed the directional instru- 
ments into the course-control and 
armed the starting charge for the 
chemical motors. When he had 
checked everything carefully, as he 
had been taught, he strapped him- 
self into the control chair with his 
hand on the arm-rest over the fir- 
ing button. He knew it was going 
to hurt him. 

He fired, and it did hurt him, 
DON BERRY 




the sense of explosive pressure, the 
abrupt thundering vibration. It was 
not the same as the soft, enfolding 
purr of the Skipdrive, comforting, 
assuring, loving . 

What’s that? Loving? 

A wife is a Martha , he thought. 
A Martha is a wife. 

It seemed to mean something, 
but he didn’t have time to decipher 
it before he passed out. 

W HEN HE GAME TO he im- 
mediately switched off the 
chemical drive. It had given him 
a good shove in the right direc- 
tion, and that was all that was 
necessary. He would coast in now, 
and he had to save his fuel for 
maneuvering in atmosphere. 

After that, he rested, trying to 
accustom himself to the harshness 
of things in mass-space. 

His time-to-destination indicator 
gave him ten hours, when he began 
to feel uneasy. He couldn’t pin- 
point the source of unease at first. 
He was fidgety, impatient. Or 
something that resembled those 
feelings. It was like when he 
couldn’t remember why he wasn’t 
supposed to turn the Skipdrive 
back on. It occurred to him that he 
wasn’t thinking clearly, somehow. 

He noticed to his surprise he had 
switched on his transmitter. Prob- 
ably while he was drumming his 
fingers or something. He switched it 
off. 

Thirty minutes later he found 
himself toying with the same 
switch. He had turned it on again. 
This was getting ridiculous. He 
shouldn’t be so nervous. 



He grinned wryly to himself. 
The transmitter switch, indeed. If 
ever a useless piece of junk had been 
put in Phoenix /, that was it. 
Transmitter switch! 

He laughed aloud. And left 
the switch open. 

He found himself staring with 
fascination at the microphone. It 
was pretty interesting, he had to 
admit that. It was mounted on the 
back of the control chair, on swivel 
arms. It could easily be pulled into 
position right in front of his face. 
Just as if it had been meant to. 
He fiddled with it interestedly, 
swinging it back and forth, seeing 
how it moved on the swivel arms. 

He was interested in the way it 
moved so smoothly, that was all. 
By coincidence, when he let go of 
it, it was directly in front of him. 

There was something picking at 
him, something was nagging at the 
back of his mind. He whistled un- 
der his breath and knuckled his 
eyes. He scrubbed at the top of his 
head with his right hand, as if he 
could rub the annoying thought. 
Suddenly he heard his own voice 
saying : 

“Earth Control this is Phoenix I. 
Come in please.” 

He looked up, startled. Now 
why would he say a thing like 
that? 

And then, in the midst of his 
surprise, he repeated it! 

“Earth Control this is Phoenix /. 
Come in please.” 

He flipped the Receive switch 
without volition. His hands had 
suddenly developed a life of 
their own. He began to breathe 
more rapidly, and his forehead felt

cool. He swallowed twice, quickly. 

There was no answer on the re- 
ceiver. 

No what? Answer? What is “an- 
swer”? 

“Estimate arrival four hundred 
seventy- two minutes,” he said 
loudly, looking at the time-to-desti- 
nation indicator. 

There was a sudden flood of re- 
lief, washing away the irritation 
that had been picking away at the 
back of his mind. He felt at ease 
again. He turned off both transmit- 
ter and receiver and stood out of 
the control chair. He felt better 
now, but he was a little worried 
about what had happened. 

He couldn’t understand it. Sud- 
denly he had lost control of him- 
self, of his voice and his hands. He 
was doing meaningless things, say- 
ing things, making motions stu- 
pidly. Every movement he made, 
every act, was without pattern or 
sense. 

He had a sudden thought, and it 
made his whole body grow cold and 
prickly, and he almost choked. 

Maybe I’m going Nova . 

He was near the edge of panic 
for a minute. Nova Nova Nova 
Nova. 

Brightly flaring, burning out, 
lighting space around for billions 
of light years . 

That was how it started, he 
knew. Unpredictability, variation 
without explanation . He sat 
back down in the control chair, 
feeling shaky and weak and fright- 
ened. 

By the time he had regained his 
balance, time-to-destination told 
him 453 minutes. 



H E GUIDED Phoenix 1 into an 
orbit around Earth. He circled 
three times, braking steadily with 
his forward rockets until he entered 
atmosphere. 

On his fifth pass he spotted his 
landing place. How he knew, he 
didn’t quite understand, but he 
knew it when he saw it. There was 
a sense of satisfaction somewhere in 
him that told him, “That’s it. 
That’s the right place.” 

Each succeeding pass was lower 
and slower, until finally he was 
maneuvering the ungainly bulk of 
the ship like a plane, wholly in at- 
mosphere. 

Like a what? 

But he was too busy to worry 
about it. Fighting the Phoenix I 
down in atmosphere required all 
his attention. Absently he noted 
the amazingly regular formations 
of rock surrounding his landing 
place. 

His hands flew over the console 
automatically, a skilled performer 
playing a well-learned fugue with- 
out conscious attention to detail. 
The overall .pattern was clear in his 
mind, and he knew with absolute 
confidence he could depend on his 
hands to take care of the necessary 
small motions that went to make up 
the large pattern. 

He did not think: Upper left 
button third from end right bank 
rockets three-quarters correct de- 
viation. 

He thought: Straight . And his 
hand darted out. 

The ground was near below him, 
now. He could see parts of the land- 
scape through the port, wavering 
uncertainly in the heat waves from 

DON BERRY

his landing blast. 

Slower . slower . slower . 
The roar was reflected loud off the 
flat below . 

Touch. 

Perfect , he thought happily. Per - 
feet perfect perfect . 

He leaned contentedly back in 
the control chair and watched the 
needles of the console gauges fall 
lifeless back to the pins. 

He whistled a little tune under 
his breath and smiled. 

Now what? 

Get out. 

He couldn’t think of the reason 
for it, but he would do it. While he 
waited for the hull to cool, he 
dropped the exit ladder, listened to 
the whine of the servomotors. 

He opened the port and stood at 
the edge, looking out. His headache 
had come back again, worse than 
ever, and he grimaced at the sud- 
den p^in. 

Before him stretched the flat 
black plane of the landing pad, end- 
ing abruptly in the regular forma- 
tions he had noted before. They 
were mostly white, and contrasted 
strongly with the black of the pad. 
They weren’t, he realized, rock 
formations at all, they were — 

They were — buildings, they — 

His mind shied away from the 
thought. 

It was silent. His headache 
seemed to be affecting his vision, 
somehow. Either that or the land- 
ing pad wasn’t cool yet. When he 
looked toward the — toward the 
white formations at the edge of the 
pad, they seemed to waver slightly 
near the ground. Heat waves still, 
he decided. 



Nimbly, and with a pleasant 
sense of being home again, he 
scrambled down the ladder and 
stood on the ground, tiny beneath 
the clumsy shape of Phoenix L 

About halfway between the edge 
of the pad and his ship stood a tiny 
cluster of thin, upright poles. From 
their bases he could see black, 
snakelike cables twisting off toward 
the edge, shifting in his uncertain 
vision. He walked toward them. 

The silence was so complete it 
was unnatural. It was almost as if 
his ears were plugged, rather than 
the simple absence of sound. Well, 
he supposed that was natural, after 
all. He had lived with the buzzing 
purr of the Skipdrive and the thun- 
der of the rockets so long, any si- 
lence would seem abnormal. 

As he drew closer to the upright 
rods, he saw each one was topped 
with a bulge, a vaguely familiar . 

They were microphones! They 
were just like the microphone in 
Phoenix 1, the one he had fooled 
with. 

He was sincerely puzzled. All 
that transmit-receive gadgetry in 
the ship had been foolish, but what 
was he to think of finding it here 
on his landing pad? It didn’t make 
any sense. He was getting the un- 
easy sense of confusion again. The 
headache was becoming almost un- 
bearable. 

He walked over to the cluster of 
microphones. That was probably 
the place to start. He took the neck 
of one in his hand and pulled it, 
but it didn’t move smoothly, as the 
one on his control chair had. It 
simply tipped awkwardly toward 
him. 



A.O. 2110: MAN ALONE 



23 




Suddenly he felt something on 
his shoulder, and looked around 
quickly, but could see nothing. 
The pressure on his shoulder re- 
mained, and he vaguely brushed at 
it with his hand. It went away. 

He set the microphone back up- 
right and looked back at his ship. 
There was another pressure on his 
opposite shoulder, sudden and 
harder than the first had been. He 
slapped at it, and stepped back, un- 
certainly. 

One of the microphones tipped 
toward him, but he hadn’t touched 
it. He took another step backwards, 
and felt something close tightly 
around his left arm. He snapped his 
head to the left, but there was no- 
thing there. 

He twisted sharply away to the 
right, and the motion freed him, 
but his shoulder hit something 
solid. He gasped, and his throat 
tightened again. He raised his 
hand to his head. The headache 
was getting worse all the time. 

Something touched him on the 
back. 

He spun, crouching. 

Nothing. 

He stood straight again, his eyes 
wide, panting from the fear that 
was beginning to choke him. His 
fists clenched and unclenched as he 
tried to puzzle out what was hap- 
pening to him. 

The air closed abruptly around 
both arms simultaneously, gripping 
so tightly it hurt. 

He shouted and twisted loose and 
started to run back toward the 
ship. He stumbled against an in- 
visible something, fell against an- 
other, but it kept him upright and 



prevented his falling. Several times 
as he ran, things he could not see 
brushed him, touched him on the 
shoulders and back. 

By the time he scrambled up the 
ladder, his breath was short, and 
coming in little whimpers. The 
headache was the greatest pain he 
thought he could ever have known, 
and he wondered if he were dying. 

He had to kick at invisible things 
that clutched at his feet on the lad- 
der, and when he reached the 
edge of the port he stood kicking 
and flailing at nothing until he was 
certain none of the — creatures, 
things were there. 

He shut the port swiftly and ran 
breathlessly up to the control room. 
He threw himself into the padded 
chair. 

Finally he lowered his head into 
his hands and began to weep.

IGHT. 

The land turned gray and 
silver and white under the chill 
light of the rising moon. The build- 
ings of Gila Lake Base IV were 
sharp and distinct, glowing faintly 
in the moonlight as if lit somehow 
inside the concrete walls. 

On the landing pad, Phoenix 1 
squatted darkly, clumsily. The 
moon washed its bulbous flanks 
with cascading light that flowed 
down the long surfaces of the hull 
and disappeared into the absorbent 
blackness without trace. Tiny prick- 
ling reflections of stars glinted from 
the once-polished metal. 

At the edges of the Base, where 

DON BERRY

wire meshes stretched up out of 
the desert dividing the things of 
the desert from the things of men, 
nervous patrols paced forlornly in 
the night. 

One of the blockhouses at the 
inner edge of the landing area 
presented two yellow rectangles of 
windows to the night. Inside the 
blockhouse were two men, talking. 

One of the men was in uniform, 
and his collar held the discreet star- 
and-comet of a staff officer, Spa- 
Serv. He was young for his rank, 
perhaps in his early forties, with 
gray eyes that now were harried. 
He sat on the edge of his desk re- 
garding the other man. 

The second of the two was a 
civilian. He was slumped in an 
oddly incongruous overstuffed 
chair, with his legs stretched out 
straight before him. He held the 
bowl of an unlit pipe in both hands 
and sucked morosely on the stem as 
the SpaServ brigadier talked. He 
was slightly younger than the other, 
but his hair was beginning to thin 
at the temples. He had sharp blue 
eyes that regarded the tips of his 
shoes without apparent interest. 
Colin Meany was his name, and he 
was a psychiatrist. 

Finally General Banning finished 
his account of the afternoon, raised 
his hands in a shrug, and said, 
“That’s it. That’s all we have. 55 

Colin Meany took his pipe out 
of his mouth and regarded the 
tooth-marked bit curiously. He 
shoved it in his coat pocket and 
walked over to the window, look- 
ing out across the moon-flooded 
flat to the looming, ominous shape 
of Phoenix 1. He stood with his 

A.D. 2110: MAN ALONE 



hands clasped behind him, rocking 
gently back and forth on his toes. 

“Ugly thing, 55 he said casually. 

Banning shrugged. The psychi- 
atrist turned away from the win- 
dow and sat down again. He be- 
gan to fill his pipe. 

“Where is he now? 55 he asked. 

“In the ship, 55 the general told 
him. 

“What’s he doing? 59 

Banning laughed bitterly. 
“Broadcasting a distress signal. 55 

“Voice?” 

“Does it matter?” the general 
asked. 

“I don’t know.” 

“No, it’s code. It’s an automatic 
tape. The kind all passenger ves- 
sels carry.” 

Colin considered this for a mo- 
ment. “And he didn’t say any- 
thing.” 

“Absolutely nothing,” said Gen- 
eral Banning. “He got out of the 
ship, walked over to the reception 
committee, slapped a few people 
and ran back to the ship and locked 
himself in.” 

“It doesn’t make any sense.” 

“You’re telling me?” After a 
second the general added almost 
wistfully, “He knocked Senator 
Gilroy down.” 

Colin laughed. “Good for him.” 

“Yeah,” the general agreed. 
“That bastard fought us tooth and 
nail all the way down the line, cut- 
ting appropriations, taking our best 
men . Then when we get a ship 
back, he’s the first in line for the 
newsreels.” 

Colin looked up. “You have 

newsreels?” 

“Sure, but I don’t think they’re 

25 




processed yet. 5 ’ 

“Why didn’t you tell me that in 
the first place? Check them, will 
you?” 

The general made a short phone 
call. When he hung up he looked 
embarrassed. “You want to see 
them?” 

“Very much.” 

‘There’s a viewing room in Build- 
ing Three,” Banning said. “We can 
walk.” 

When the lights had come on 
again, Colin sat staring at the 
blank screen for a long time. Fi- 
nally he sighed, stood and stretched. 

“Well,” Bannnig said. “What do 
you think?” 

“I’ll want to see it again. But it’s 
pretty clear, I think.” 

The general looked up in sur- 
prise. “Clear? It’s just the same 
thing I told you.” 

“Oh, no,” Colin said. “You left 
out the most important part.” 
“What was that?” 

“Your boy is blind and deaf.” 
“Blind and deaf! You’re crazy. 
The ship, he looked at the ship, and 
the microphone, and . 

“Oh, it’s pretty selective blind- 
ness,” Colin said. He filled his pipe 
with maddening slowness and lit it 
before he spoke again. 

“People,” he said finally. “He 
doesn’t see people. At all.” 



ARKINS FELL asleep leaning 
forward in -the control chair 
with his head on his arms. When he 
wakened, the sky outside the view- 
port was turning dark. With a 
sense of sudden danger, he clamped 



down the metal shutters over the 
port. Methodically he climbed 
down catwalks the length of the 
ship, making certain all ports were 
secured both from entry and from 
sight. He didn’t want to see out- 
side. 

When he had done this, he felt 
easier. Walking to the galley, he 
put a can of soup in the heater, and 
took it back up to the control room 
with him. 

He sat there, absently eating his 
soup and staring ahead at the con- 
sole. He noted he was beginning to 
get used to the harsh outlines it 
presented in this space. Suddenly 
he realized there was a red light on 
the board. He put the bowl of soup 
carefully on the deck and went over 
to the transmitter where a loop of 
tape was endlessly repeating itself, 
apparently broadcasting. He could 
not remember having inserted it. 
The empty spool lying beside the 
transmitter read AUTOMATIC 
DISTRESS CODE. 

He understood all the words, all 
right, but put together they didn’t 
seem to make any sense. AUTO- 
MATIC DISTRESS CODE. What 
would it be for? Why would such a 
thing be broadcast? If you were in 
distress, you surely knew it without 
transmitting it. 

He shook his head. Things were 
very bad with him. He was pro- 
foundly disturbed by his loss of 
control. Performing all sorts of 
meaningless actions without voli- 
tion . And now, with this tape, 
he had not even been conscious of 
the act, could not remember it. 

He went back to the control chair 
and finished his bowl of soup.

Thinking about it, his meaning- 
less activities had all been centered 
around one thing, this odd trans- 
mit-receive apparatus, this radio. 
He had looked at it before, and he 
realized it was very carefully con- 
structed, and complicated. The 
wiring itself confused him. And 
more than that, he could not de- 
termine any possible use such a 
thing might have. 

Thinking about it gave him the 
same prickly sensation at the back 
of his neck as when he thought 
about the nonsense words in the 
songs he knew. “Wife/’ Things like 
that. 

He rubbed the back of his neck 
hard, until it hurt. He realized his 
headache had almost gone away 
when he secured the ports, but now 
it was coming back again. 

Another light flashed on the con- 
sole, and a melodic “beep — beep” 
began to sound from somewhere 
behind the panel. 

Automatically he reached for- 
ward a*id flipped a switch, and the 
“beep— beep” stopped. Without 
surprise, he noticed it was the 
switch marked Receive. 

So. When the light flashed and 
the “beep — beep” sounded he was 
supposed to throw that Receive 
switch. Presumably, then, he should 
receive something. Was that right? 

He looked around the control 
room, but nothing happened. 

Just on the edge of his conscious- 
ness there was a faint sussuration, 
but when he turned his attention 
to it, it disappeared. There was no 
sound. But when he thought of 
something else, it came back again. 

It was like an image caught in 

A.D. 2110: MAN ALONE 



the corner of his eye. There was 
nothing there, but sometimes you 
thought you caught just a flash of 
something out of the comer of 
your eye. Like this afternoon . 

He shuddered at the recollection. 

In all his life, he could not re- 
member anything that had driven 
him into such pure panic as the 
loathsome invisible touches he had 
felt. What kind of creatures were 
these? 

This was Earth. This was his 
home, it was where he belonged, 
and he couldn’t remember any- 
thing about invisible . 

Yes! Yes, he did remember! But 
there was still something wrong be- 
cause — he couldn’t think why. 

He remembered walking on a 
grassy meadow on a spring day. The 
grass was rich and luxuriant and 
the sun was hot copper in the sky. 
He was walking toward the top of 
a hill. Right at the top there was 
a single small, green tree. He was 
going to go up and lie down under 
that tree and look down in the 
valley at the meadow. And beside 
him there was — a presence. He re- 
membered turning to look, and — 
nothing. There was nothing there. 

But the feeling of the presence 
next to him made him pleased, 
somehow. It was right. It was not 
menacing, like this afternoon, it 
was more — comforting. As the 
sound the Skipdrive made was 
comforting. It made him feel fine. 
But when he turned to look, there 
was nothing. 

He could not remember. 

What kind of presence? Like the 
ship? No, much smaller. Smaller 
even than himself. Compared to 

27 




the ship, he was small, quite small. 
He was infinitely smaller than even 
planetary mass. And there were 
things on the ship that were smaller 
than he. 

But he couldn’t quite place him- 
self with assurance on the scale of 
of size. He was larger than some 
things, like the bowl of soup, and 
he was smaller than other things, 
like planets. He must be of a sort 
of medium size. But closer to the 
bowl of soup than the planet. 

A wife is a Martha. 

He remembered thinking that 
just as the rockets had fired. It was 
in the song . He whistled a few 
bars. 1 had a good wife but 1 left 
her, oh, oh, oh, oh. 

And it had something to do with 
the remembered — presence, when 
he was walking in the meadow. 

But what was a Martha? You 
can’t define a nonsense word in 
terms of another nonsense word. 
Or perhaps, he thought ruefully, 
you can’t define it any other way. 

A wife is a Martha. A wife is a 
Martha. A Martha is a wife. 

Nothing. 

But he felt the headache coming 
on again. 

He went down to the galley 
again, and took the soup bowl with 
him. He put it in the washer, and 
rummaged around in the cabinets 
until he found the little white pills 
that helped his headaches. He took 
three of them before he went back 
up to the control room. 

He had to make some kind of 
plans for — for what? Escape? He 
didn’t want to escape. He was 
home. He wanted tb stay here. 
But he had to deal with the — 



things, somehow. He wondered if 
they could be killed. There was no 
way to tell. If you killed one you 
couldn’t see its body. 

And he didn’t have any weap- 
ons, at any rate. He would simply 
have to outsmart them. He won- 
dered how smart they were. And 
how large. That would make a 
good deal of difference, how large 
they were. 

He went to the viewport and 
cracked the shutter, just a little. It 
was dark. He didn’t want to go out 
in the dark, that was too much. It 
would be too much risk. He would 
wait until morning. 

In spite of the pills, the headac he 
was getting worse, almost to the 
insane level it had been in the after- 
noon. He decided he’d better try 
to sleep. 



3 . 

C OLIN AND General Banning 
stood at the shoulder of the 
radio operator in Gila Base IV 
Central Control. It was just past 
midnight. Banning’s fatigue was 
evident ; Colin, having been in- 
volved a shorter time, still looked 
reasonably fresh. 

Monotonously the radio tech 
droned: “Gila Control to Phoenix 
I come in please. Gila Control to 
Phoenix I come in please. Gila 
Control to Phoenix 1 come in 
please.” After every third repetition 
of the chant, he switched to Re- 
ceive and briefly listened to the 
buzz and crackle from the over- 
head speakers. 

“Gila Control to Phoenix 1 . 



28 



DON BERRY 




“Is he still transmitting the dis- 
tress code?” Colin asked. 

“Yes, sir,” the tech said. “But he 
could sti^reply if he wanted to. 
Distress dperates from a separate 
transmitter on a single fixed fre- 
quency. The ordinary transmitter 
isn’t tied up.” 

“I§ he receiving?” 

“I think so. When we gave him 
the ‘Message coming’ impulse, he 
switched to receive. That was hours 
ago. 

“Maybe he’s tuned to the wrong 
frequency,” Banning suggested. 

The tech looked up in surprise, 
then resumed his respectful atti- 
tude toward the brass. “No, sir. His 
rig is a self-tuner. The signal auto- 
matically tunes the receiver to the 
right frequency. He’s getting it, all 
right.” 

“In other words,” Colin said, 
“your voice is being broadcast on 
the ship’s speakers.” 

“As far as I can tell.” 

“Mm.” 

Colin leaned back against a 
chart table and pulled on his pipe 
for a few moments. 

“Please go on, sergeant,” he said 
finally. “Keep trying. But change 
the patter to ‘please reply,’ would 
you?” 

“What difference does that 
make?” Banning asked. “That’s 
what ‘come in’ means, anyway. 
Same thing.” 

“Just an idea,” Colin said. “Why 
don’t you get some rest? You look 
beat.” 

“What kind of an idea?” Ban- 
ning said, rubbing his forehead. 

“Can you get a couple of cots 
brought to your office?” 

A.D. 2110: MAN ALONE 



“Yes, but what’s your idea?” 

“Come on along and I’ll tell you 
about it,” Colin said. 

They left Central Control, with 
the voice of the sergeant sound- 
ing behind them, “ Gila Control to 
Phoenix 1 please reply. Gila Con- 
trol . .” 

Reaching Banning’s office, Colin 
sent one of the ubiquitous armed 
guards after two cots. 

“You can’t shoot all your energy 
at once,” he pointed out, when 
Banning protested he didn’t need 
the sleep. “If we’re going to get 
Harkins out of that ship, we’re go- 
ing to have to stay in pretty good 
shape ourselves.” 

“All right,” Banning grumbled. 
He made coffee on the hot plate 
from the bottom drawer of his desk, 
grinning at Colin like a small boy 
caught stealing cookies. “I like a 
little coffee once in a while,” he 
explained unnecessarily. 

When they had settled them- 
selves with the coffee, Banning 
asked, “All right, now. Why’d you 
change ‘come in please’ to ‘please 
reply’?” 

“It’s less ambiguous,” Colin said. 
“ ‘Come in please’ could mean 
several things.” 

“So? Anybody with as much 
radio experience as Harkins knows 
what ‘Come in please’ means.” 

“You’re going to have to get used 
to the idea you’re not dealing with 
Harkins in this. Take the point of 
view, this is somebody you’ve never 
seen before. Somebody you have to 
figure out from scratch.” 

' “Mm. I suppose so. Okay, why 
the change?” 

“Well—” Colin hesitated. “First 

29 




of all, this — blindness is purely a 
functional block of some kind. 
There’s nothing organically wrong 
with his vision.” 

“I’m still not sure I go along 
with your blind-deaf idea,” the 
General said dubiously. 

“I’m virtually certain, after see- 
ing the film strip again. Your 
Colonel Harkins behaves exactly 
like a man being molested by 
something he can’t see.” 

“For the sake of argument, then 
. Banning nodded. 

“All right. Presupposing he 
does not want to see human be- 
ings — for whatever reason — there 
are several mechanisms he could 
use.” 

“He didn’t even have to come 
back,” Banning pointed out. 

“That’s one of the mechanisms. 
But he did come back. Why? Prob- 
lem one, for the future. Mechanism 
two: Catalepsy. Suspension of all 
sensation and consciousness.” 
“Obviously not the case.” 
“Right. Mechanism three,” Col- 
in went on, ticking the points off 
on his fingers, “ partial disorien- 
tation. Loss of perception of ^ single 
class of objects, human beings.” 
“Even that isn’t entirely true,” 
Banning said. “He felt people.” 
“That’s right. And I think this is 
our opening wedge. Of the pos- 
sible means of avoidance I named, 
partial disorientation is the least 
successful of all. It involves too 
many contradictions. He was dis- 
turbed by the microphones, for ex- 
ample. Why? Because they are 
meaningful only in a context of hu- 
man beings. Communication. He 
would have to do some fancy twist- 



ing to avoid the notion of human 
beings. The same goes for any other r 
human artifact. Somehow, in order 
to make the world ‘reasonable’ in 
his own terms, he has to explain the 
existence of these things, without 
admitting the existence of people 
who made and use them.” 

“Impossible.” 

“Very nearly. It means that some 
facet of his personality must be 
continually making decisions about 
what can be recognized and what 
cannot. His censoring mechanism is 
in a constant scramble to prevent 
certain data from reaching his con- 
scious mind. It has to justify and 
explain away all data which would 
eventually point to the existence of 
human beings.” 

“What the hell does he think he 
is?” Banning asked angrily. 

“I have no idea. Maybe that’s 
problem two for the future. At any 
rate, as you pointed out, this is an 
impossible job. It must be infinitely 
more difficult now that he’;s on 
Earth, where there are so many 
more things to explain away. This 
is going to set up a terrific strain 
inside. It may break him.” 

“What would do that to a man?” 

“I don’t know that, either,” 
Colin admitted. “Our first prob- 
lem now is to get him out of the 
ship. And to do that, we have to 
contact him.” 

“This is why you changed to 
‘please reply’? What good is it 
going to do if he can’t hear it, any- 
way?” 

“That’s the point. I think he can 
hear it. He can’t recognize it, but 
that isn’t quite the same thing. His 
eardrums still vibrate, the data gets

in, all r^it. But it doesn’t reach 
the congous level. Fortunately, it 
isn’t always necessary to be con- 
sciously aware of a stimulus before 
you can respond to it. Frequently 
a persistent stimulation just below 
the threshold of awareness will pro- 
duce a response in the organism. 
Sub-threshold stimulation, it’s 
called.” 

“Yeah,” Banning said, “I’ve 
heard of it. Used it in advertising, 
didn’t they?” 

“For a while. Before Congress 
passed the Privacy Amendment.” 
“Okay. Now what?” 

“Now we wait and see if it works. 
I’m going to take a nap. Wake me 
up if anything happens.” 

Colin stretched out on one of 
the cots, put his hands behind his 
head and soon was breathing deep- 
ly in an excellent imitation of sleep. 

T HE CLOCK on Banning’s desk 
said 4:33 when his communi- 
cator chimed. Banning was off his 
cot and at the desk before the first 
soft echoes faded. 

“Banning. Yes . yes ... all 
right, right away.” 

“What is it?” Colin asked. 
“They’ve got something from the 
Phoenix at Control.” 

When they reached the radio 
room again, a different technician 
was on shift. He was intently 
watching an oscilloscope face on 
the board in front of him. 

“What happened, did he an- 
swer?” the general asked. 

“No, sir. But a few minutes ago 
we started getting a carrier wave 
on his transmission frequency.” 

A.D. 2110: MAN ALONE 



Banning sighed disgustedly. “Is 
that all? Dammit!” 

“What does that mean?” Colin 
asked. 

“Not a damned thing,” Banning 
said angrily. “He just threw the 
transmission switch, is all.” 

“Look, sir.” The radioman 
pointed to the oscilloscope. The 
smooth sine of the carrier was 
slightly modulated now, uneven 
dips and jogs appearing rhythmi- 
cally. “There’s something coming 
through, but it’s awfully damned 
faint. ..Sir.” 

“Run your sensitivity up,” Ban- 
ning ordered. 

The radioman slowly twisted a 
knob, and the hiss-and-crackle 
coming through the speakers in- 
creased in volume until each snap 
was like a gunshot in the radio 
room. Colin winced at the noise. 
“Maximum, sir.” 

“Increase your gain, then.” 
The technician did. The speakers 
were roaring now, filling the room. 
Very faintly behind the torrent of 
sound another sound could be 
heard, more regular. The rhythm 
corresponded with the jogging of 
the oscilloscope. 

“That’s it,” Banning said. “But 
what the hell is it?” 

“I don’t — wait a minute,” said 
Colin. “He’s whistling! It’s a tune.” 
“You recognize it?” 

“No — no, it’s vaguely familiar, 
but—” 

“I know it, sir,” the radioman 
said. “It’s an old folksong, The 
Quaker’s Wooing.” 

“Why is it so faint?” asked Colin. 
“He must be a hell of a ways 
off-mike,” said the tech. “Clear at 



31 




the other end of the control room, 
I’d say.” 

‘ Turn down that damned noise/’ 
said Banning. The radioman 
twisted his controls back to medium 
range, and the thunderous hissing 
roar of the speakers died away. 

“Well,” said Banning, “nothing. 
We shoulda stood in bed.” 

“I’m not so sure,” Colin an- 
swered. “After all, he did start to 
transmit, and that’s more than 
we’ve had since he landed. I think 
we’d better keep it up.” 

“All right. Keep at it, sergeant.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

As Colin afnd Banning turned 
away, the psychiatrist heard the 
sergeant begin to sing softly to him- 
self. Suddenly Colin stopped and 
turned back to the man. 

“What’d you say?” he de- 
manded. 

“Nothing, sir.” 

“What you were singing, that 
song.” 

“Oh, it was the one the colonel 
was whistling, sir. It gets to run- 
ning around in your head. I’m 
sorry, it won’t happen again.” 
“No, I want to know what the 
words are. What you just said.” 
“Well, it goes, I mean it starts 
out, I can’t remember the whole — ” 
“Come on, man! Sing it!” 

In an uncertain voice the radio- 
man began to sing: 

“I had a true wife but I left her, 
oh, oh, oh, oh. 

And now I’m broken hearted, 
oh, oh, oh, oh. 

Well, if she’s gone, I wouldn’t 
mind her, 

Foldy roldy hey ding di do. 
Soon find one — " 



“That’s enough, sergeant,” Colin 
said, relaxing. He turned to Ban- 
ning. “Well, General, that’s it. The 
wedge goes in a little deeper.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Is Harkins married?” 

“Yes, yes, I think so. She lives 
in the officer’s quarters on base.” 

“Get her,” Colin said. 

“Now? My God man, it isn’t 
even five — ” 

“Get her,” Colin repeated. “Har- 
kins has her on his mind. Maybe 
we can get to him through her.” 

Martha Harkins was a small 
brunette, too plain ever to be called 
pretty. Almost mousy, Colin 
thought. But intelligent, and quick 
to understand the situation, in spite 
of her nervousness. She sat on the 
opposite side of Banning’s desk, 
her hands folded quietly in her lap, 
fingers twined, while Colin ex- 
plained what they wanted her to 
do. Her still-sleepy eyes were fixed 
on her fingers while the psychia- 
trist talked. 

“I — I think I see,” she said 
hesitantly. “What it comes down to 
is that you want me to try to talk 
Dick out of Phoenix I.” 

Colin nodded. “It may not be 
easy. I’ve told you as much as .we 
know about the condition of his 
mind. He will not consciously hear 
you, in all likelihood. We hope to 
appeal to deep-seated emotions be- 
low the conscious level. Are you 
willing to try?” 

“Of course,” she said with real 
surprise, looking up at him for the 
first time. 

“Good,” Colin said warmly. He 
stood from behind the desk. “We’ll

DON BERRY 




take yoj4fever to radio, now” 
Bamnng was waiting for them 
in Central Control. 

“Any change?” Colin asked. 
“No. Same thing. Sometimes he 
comes closer to the mike. We can 
hear his footsteps. He seems to be 
wandering around the control 
room pretty aimlessly. Or maybe 
he’s just carrying on the in-flight 
routine, we can’t tell.” 

•'This is Mrs. Harkins,” Colin 
said. “General Banning.” 

“Thank you for coming, Mrs. 
Harkins,” the general said. “I hope 
this isn’t too difficult for you.” 
He took her small hand in his own. 

Martha Harkins smiled faintly. 
“A service wife gets used to just 
about everything, general.” 

“Unfortunately true. If you’ll 
come with me, I’ll introduce you to 
your technician. Has Dr. Meany 
explained what we want vou to 
do?” 

“Yes, I think so.” 

“Good.” 

“Just one thing, Mrs. Harkins,” 
Colin put in. “This may take some 
time. It may be we’ll want you to 
cut a tape with a request to leave 
the ship, if we can’t get any re- 
sponse from live voice. Repetition 
is the important thing, and the 
sound of your voice.” 

“All right. I’ll do whatever you 
say.” She turned away briefly, but 
not before Colin saw the beginnings 
of tears in her eyes. 

Banning led her over to the 
radio console, saw her seated and 
instructed in the use of the equip- 
ment, and returned to Colin. 
“What do you think?” he said. 
“She’ll do.” 



“Will it work?” 

“How the hell do I know?” the 
psychiatrist answered roughly. 

They were silent for a moment, 
watching the small figure of the 
woman leaning forward tensely 
over the microphone, as if by her 
nearness she might make her hus- 
band hear. 

“You know,” Banning said mus- 
ingly, “I get the feeling this is all 
the fault of SpaServ, somehow. 
Some little thing we overlooked. A 
little more training, maybe.” 

The woman’s soft voice droned 
on, not quite carrying distinctly to 
the two men, though the warmth 
and urgency of it was evident in 
her tone. 

“I think you did all right with 
your training,” Colin said finally. 
“He came back, didn’t he 0 ” 



4 . 

H arkins slept only lightly, 

turning restlessly in the large 
control chair. Finally the pain of 
his headache increased td the point 
he could no longer sleep at all, even 
lightly. Just before he wakened, 
he thought he heard a sound at 
once intolerably loud and some- 
how soothing. Which was impos- 
sible, of course. 

Opening the viewport shutter a 
crack, he found the land outside 
lit ambiguously by the false dawn 
that was beginning to spread 
against the eastern hills. 

He took several more of the 
white pills for his headache. Briefly 
he considered eating something, but 
abandoned the idea. The pain was 

33 



A.D. 2110: MAN ALONE 




so intense, he didn’t think he could 
keep anything down. 

He found the illusion he had 
noted yesterday — the whispering 
sound he could not hear when he 
tried — was still there. It was even 
worse now. 

All about him was the flickering 
shadow of a sound, demanding his 
attention, requesting. And still — 
when he tried to hear it, it was 
gone. 

He pressed his knuckles against 
his forehead and clenched his eyes 
tightly shut. 

If only he had something to do 
to take his mind off the headache 
and the elusive sound . But 
there was nothing to do. With 
neither the Skipdrive nor the 
atomics operating, he had not even 
the routine powerchecks to keep 
him occupied. 

Then why am I here? 

His function was to operate the 
ship. That much he knew without 
doubt. And he was well suited to 
operate it. His hands were proper- 
ly shaped to manipulate the con- 
trols, and he could do it automa- 
tically, without thinking about it. 
He was Ship-Operator. 

But the ship was not operat- 
ing .. 

What was his function then, 
when the ship was not operating? 

The other control devices, when 
not controlling, automatically shut 
off. Perhaps something had gone 
wrong in his shut-off relay. 

That was not it, either. He was 
not the same as the other control- 
ling mechanisms. He was different. 
Different materials, different po- 
tential functions in his structure, 

34 



all kinds of differences. 

But even if it were true that he 
was not intended to switch off when 
not functioning as Ship-Operator, 
what was he to do? 

Think it out. Think this thing 
out very carefully. 

Pain was a signal of improper 
functioning. All right. He was not 
functioning properly, then, and he 
knew it because of the level of pain 
in his head. If he could get rid of 
the headache, he would at the 
same time be finding his proper 
function. 

Step one, then: Get rid of the 
headache. And he had to do that 
anyway, because he was unable to 
think clearly while he had li. 

The headache had alleviated 
several times, then come back 
again. That meant he had per- 
formed properly, then drifted away 
into — into — Wrong was the word 
that came to his mind. Wrong. He 
had drifted into improper function- 
ing, and the word for that was 
Wrong, and his headache had come 
back as a result. 

All right. When had the head- 
ache alleviated? 

He tried to think back. The 
first time, the first time was when 
he had found himself speaking the 
meaningless words into the micro- 
phone, announcing his estimated 
time-to-destination. And then, 
when he had closed the viewports. 
And throwing that Receive 
switch . 

What did these actions have in 
common? What factor did they 
share? 

Only one thing. Two, really. 
First, they had some connection 

DON BERRY 




with the transmit-receive apparatus. 
Or two of the three did, at any 
rate. The other factor, shared by 
all three acts, was that they were 
done almost without his conscious 
will. 

This, then, might be the critical 
factor. That he act without voli- 
tion. 

Relax. Completely. Allow your- 
self to act. 

He leaned back in the control 
chair and tried to blank his mind, 
tried not to give his body any com- 
mands. 

Without volition, without will - 
ing. 

He closed his eyes. 

For a long while there was noth- 
ing. Then he heard the whir of 
servomotors. He opened his eyes, 
delicately probed with his mind . 
and the headache had lessened. 

He glanced up at the console, 
to see what he had done. A red 
bulb glowed over the label AIR- 
LOCK. He had thrown the airlock 
switch, then. And it had been the 
“proper function” for him, because 
the headache had lessened. But the 
out-of-range whispering had not 
diminished. 

The airlock? He shook his head 
in puzzlement. But the technique 
seemed to be working. What now? 

He closed his eyes again, and 
this time the delay was shorter. He 
knew before he looked what had 
happened. He had lowered the 
landing ladder. 

Well, this began to be obvious. 
He was to leave the ship. 

And yet, the headache had been 
worst when he had left the ship. 
What did that mean? It seemed to 



mean leaving the ship was a W rong 
function. But it was certainly in- 
dicated this time, from his open- 
ing of the airlock and lowering 
the ladder. 

Well, what was Wrong function 
at one time might well be Right 
function another time. That could 
happen. 

Leave the ship . 

There was an edge of pleasant- 
ness and warmth to that thought, 
and the headache diminished. 

fC Please leave the ship , Dick . 

It was almost as if he could hear 
a warmth in the air saying that to 
him. 

Try the alternative. Deliberately 
he thought: Stay in the ship . 

A flash of pain soared up the 
back of his head and across the 
top to settle swirling and agonizing- 
ly in his temples. 

Leave the ship , he thought 
quickly, and the pain abated. 

Clear enough. 

He got to his feet and carefully 
made his way out of the control 
room down the catwalk toward 
the airlock that stood open and 
waiting to let him out of Phoenix 
1 ... 

An excited non-com slammed 
open the door to the radio room 
and shouted, “The airlock’s open- 
ing!” 

Banning and Colin dashed to 
the broad window and stared out 
at the bulky shape of Phoenix 1, 
resting monolithic on the landing 
pad. Banning took the proffered 
binoculars from the non-com, 
focussed them on the broad flank 
of the ship. 



A.D. 2110: MAN ALONE 



35 




“It’s open, all right,” he said. 
“Here.” He handed the binoculars 
to Colin. 

After a long delay, the landing 
ladder slid down the side of the 
ship. 

“I think he’s going to come out.” 
“There he is.” 

“What’s he doing?” 

“Standing in the airlock, look- 
ing around. Now he’s starting to 
come down. Now he’s at the bot- 
tom of the ladder, looking around 
again . Now he’s walking this 
way.” 

“Give me the glasses,” Banning 
said. He looked for a long mo- 
ment, making sure the colonel’s 
direction did not change. “Still 
coming this way,” he said, putting 
the glasses carefully on the table 
by the window. He turned to look 
at the psychiatrist. “What now?” 
Colin shrugged. “Get him.” 
“Sergeant!” Banning called. 
“Sergeant, take five men . .” 

T HE ROOM in which they put 
him was comfortable and 
secure. Very secure. The bed was 
firmly welded to the wall, the table 
bolted to the floor. There was noth- 
ing movable or detachable in the 
room. 

The three microphones picked 
up little but the shuffle of feet; 
cameras dutifully imprinted on 
film the image of a man pacing 
restlessly back and forth, examin- 
ing the fixtures of the room with- 
out apparent anxiety or curiosity. 

“No trouble at all,” Banning 
answered Colin’s question. “He 
didn’t even see the patrol. Spray 

36 



shot of Somnol in the arm and that 
was it.” 

“He doesn’t seem particularly 
upset,” Colin mused, watching the 
screen on which the lean figure of 
Colonel Harkins paced. 

“Nervous,” Banning said. 

“Not as badly as the situation 
would warrant. I don’t think it’s 
getting through to him. He’s apa- 
thetic.” 

“How did he react to seeing 
his wife?” Banning asked. 

“Bewildered him. Gave him a 
hell of a headache.” 

“That all?” 

“That’s all.” 

“What now?” 

Colin sighed. “Get through to 
him some way.” He tamped tobac- 
co in his pipe, his eyes still on the 
spyscreen. Harkins was now sit- 
ting on the bed, his hands im- 
mobile on his knees, staring straight 
ahead. 

“How do you intend to do that?” 

Colin reached for a pad of paper 
and began scribbling, talking as 
he wrote. “How are you feeding 
him?” 

“Double door compartment. Put 
the food in, close the outside door, 
open the inside.” 

“Put this on his tray next time, 
will you?” Colin handed the gen- 
eral a slip of paper. On it was 
written a single sentence: Richard 
Harkins , I want to talk to you. 

“All right,” Banning said, read- 
ing it. “He’s due for lunch in about 
an hour.” 

On the screen, Colin could see 
the light come on over the food 
compartment, and the microphones 

DON BERRY 




picked up the sound of a bell. 
Harkins, who had not moved from 
the bed since his initial examina- 
tion of the cubicle, looked up. The 
inner door of the compartment 
opened, revealing a tray with 
several steaming dishes, a pitcher 
of milk and a pot of coffee on a 
self-warm pad. 

Harkins stood up. He looked at 
the food, walked over to the tiny 
open door and picked up the tray. 
Calmly he carried it over to the 
table, sat down, unfolded the nap- 
kin and put it in his lap. 

“My God,” Banning whispered, 
“you’d think he’d eaten this way 
all his life.” 

“Apathetic,” Colin said shortly. 
“He refuses to admit anything un- 
usual.” 

“How the hell could he rational- 
ize losing consciousness and wak- 
ing up in a windowless room?” 

Colin shrugged. “Brain’s a funny 
thing,” was his only comment. His 
eyes were fixed intently on the 
screen. Suddenly Harkins noticed 
the slip of paper tucked under the 
corner of one of the dishes. 

Colin leaned forward, took his 
pipe out of his mouth. 

Harkins withdrew the paper and 
looked at it. Even on the screen, 
Colin could see the writing, almost 
make out the words. 

Harkins stared briefly at the 
paper, turned it over and looked 
at the other side in puzzlement. He 
rubbed the back of his neck and 
frowned. 

Finally he gave a little shrug, 
put the message back on the tray 
and resumed eating. 

Colin sat heavily back in his 

A.D. 2110: MAN ALONE 



chair. He sighed. 

“He didn’t even see it,” Ban- 
ning said disgustedly. 

“He saw the paper, not the 
message.” 

“Why?” 

“Personal communication. It 
implies the existence of another 
communicating — entity. He won’t 
admit it.” Cojin re-lit his pipe. 

“Ah, hell!” 

“I guess we’ll' *have to take the 
direct approach,” Colin said 
thoughtfully. 

He lay relaxed on the bed in the 
little room, his eyes closed, his 
face calm and quiet. Pulse normal, 
temperature normal. Above and 
in the walls recorders and cameras 
purred almost silently with the 
bland indifference of omniscience. 

Harkins . 

Yes. 

Can you hear me? 

. no . The strain of the 
question twisted the man’s face in- 
to a grimace of pain. 

Pause. Then: 

You are Richard Harkins. 

Yes. 

Colonel . 

Yes. 

Can you hear me? 

I ... No. Anxious contortion. 
All right. It's all right. 

The man’s face returned to re- 
laxation. 

How old are you? 

Thirty-two. 

Have you always been thirty- 
two? 

Have you always been thirty- 
two? 



37 




. no . Hesitantly. 

You were once younger. 

Yes. 

You were once a child and grew 
to be a young man and grew to be 
thirty-two. 

. yes . 

Why do you hesitate? 

1 don’t understand all the words 
you say . 

What words don’t you under- 
stand ? 

Well — Man . The expression of 
pain and anxiety flitted across bis 
relaxed features. 

1 will explain the words later . 
Don’t worry about them now. 

All right. 

Richard Harkins , we are going 
to move back to a time when you 
were nineteen . You are nineteen 
years old. You are nineteen. 

How old are you? 

Nineteen. 

What are you doing? 

1 — I’m a cadet, I — 

What kind of cadet? 

. SpaServ . 

All right, now we’ll move ahead 
two years. You are twenty-one 
years old. Twenty-one. How old 
are you? 

Gradually Colin brought Harkins 
forward in time, carefully, feeling 
his way gingerly along the dark 
corridors of his mind. He brought 
him through cadets, graduation, his 
marriage to Martha (touchy: gen- 
tly, gently) — his service in the 
planetary fleet. 

Then: a mysterious phrase; 

rumors — Phoenix Project. 

— nobody seems to know . Some- 



thing secret , but no telling. Every- 
thing’s secret this year. Testing of- 
ficers right and left and up and 
down. But nobody knows what 
for .. 

. card waiting for me at 
breakfast . 

Months of testing. Still nobody 
knows, but the rumors are running 
fast and heavy. Whole base pre- 
occupied with the misty Phoenix 
Project. Secret construction hangar, 
security precautions to the point of 
absurdity . 

. I’m it! . 

. it’s f aster -than-light drive, 
that’s what Phoenix Project is. 
F aster -than-light. The big dream, 
the dream of the stars . 

Training. Slower through the 
two years of intensive training. This 
may be a critical phase. Two years, 
endless repetitive drill, drill prac- 
tice drill drill drill . Colin’s fore- 
head feels cool as he sits beside the 
bed. Perspiration. A glance at his 
watch shows him two hours since 
they began. 

How did you take to this inten- 
sive training? 

All right. It was all right. Dull, 
you know, but it was all right gen- 
erally. After the first year it was 
pretty automatic. Conditioned re- 
sponse, 1 didn’t have to think. If 
and when such and such happens, 
press this button, throw that 
switch. Automatic. 

Automatic, Colin thought. That’s 
why he came back then. Without 
volition, responding to given sig- 
nals according to training.

Harkins grunted as the re-lived 
acceleration slammed him back in 
the control chair with a relentless 
and unabating pressure. He was 
silent for thirty seconds.

port in to Gila Base , launching

Time then on atomic rockets, 
almost a full day. Colin brushed 
over this phase, which was routine. 
As far as he could tell, Harkins 5 
duties had been designed principal- 
ly to keep him from getting bored 
before it was time to cut in the 
Skipdrive, and this corresponded 
with what General Banning had 
told him. 

As he approached the time of 
the Skip, he moved more slowly, 
taking in detail. 

. three minute bell. The bell 
is a pretty sound. 1 am checking 
the controls again . Everything is 
fine. I am sitting down in the con- 
trol chair with my hands relaxed 
over the ends of the arms. When 
my fingers brush against the but- 
tons, they tingle , or seem to. We’re 
all ready. There’s the two minute 
bell . 

Pause. 

One minute bell . 

Suddenly Harkins sat stiffly up- 
right on the bed. His eyes snapped 
open, staring with fear and dis- 
belief at something Colin could not 
see. 



Oh , my God, he whispered. 

What is it? 

But there was no direct answer. 
Harkins repeated: 

Oh, my God, my God , my 
God . 

What do you see? What is there? 

Oh Jesus the stars the stars the 
stars God in heaven 1 can’t Jesus 
make them go make them go make 
them go .. 

His voice had risen almost to a 
scream, his eyes open wide and 
staring, his body rigid. 

With a whimper, he clenched 
his eyes shut and fell back on the 
bed. He drew his knees slowly and 
jerkily up to his chest, as if resisting 
the movement, clasped his arms 
around his legs tightly. 

He began to rock back and forth, 
gently, gently, as if immersed in 
water, his breath making an in- 
voluntary whining sound as it 
passed his constricted throat. 

Move forward in time. Move 
ahead. You are coming out of the 
Skip. You are coming out of the 
Skip. You are returning to normal 
space. 

Colin’s voice was steady and calm 
over the high-pitched whines com- 
ing from the throat of the man on 
the bed. Suddenly his face relaxed. 
The eyes remained closed, but 
closed as if in sleep, rather than 
anguish. His arms and shoulder 
released their clenched grip around 
his knees. 

Evenly, smoothly, his legs 
straightened on the bed, his feet 
digging into the covers and pushing 
them into a roll at the bottom. He 
finally lay as he had begun, 
stretched straight with his hands

beside his thighs and his face re- 
laxed. When he spoke, it was in a 
normal, almost conversational tone. 

. belled out. 1 like the sound 
of that bell, it is relaxing. It's a 
good signal and I'm glad it hap - 
pens that way. I stand up from the 
control chair and stretch. 1 have 
the strong notion something very 
pleasant has happened. 

How do you feel? Do you feel 
strange ? 

No, I feel fine. Everything is 
fine. I check the instruments, and 
they show that a Skip has been 
completed. That 3 s good. I don't — 
I don't — somehow I can't remem- 
ber why 1 wanted to . 

His voice broke off, puzzled. 
Colin waited, and in a minute 
Harkins began to speak again. 

. hear the sound of the Skip- 
drive. It comforts me. Funny, 1 
don't remember ever hearing it be- 
fore . 

Go back before. Go back. You 
hear the one minute bell. You can 
hear the one minute bell and you 
are ready to make your Skip. You 
are getting ready to make your 
Skip. 

Harkins snapped upright again 
and repeated his actions. He 
shouted and screamed, his body 
was forced into the foetal position 
jerkily . 

OH GOD THE STARS THE 
STARS THE STARS 

Whimpering. 

Go forward. You arc returning 
to normal space . 

I feel fine, everything is fine. 1 
check the instruments . 

Go back . 

There was no lessening. 



Colin’s shirt was slick on his 
body with sweat, his*' face looked 
old, older, his breath came in al- 
most imperceptible quaverings, but 
his voice remained calm and as- 
sured, in violent and distinct con- 
trast to the strain that showed 
plainly as age in his face — 

Move ahead . 

Move back . 

Twenty- three minutes later, Col- 
in closed his eyes and said: 

In ten minutes from this time 
you will waken feeling refreshed 
and relaxed, as after a good sleep. 
You will be alert and fresh when 
you waken. You will feel as if you 
have just had a pleasant nap. You 
will remember nothing of what has 
happened while you were asleep, 
but you will feel fresh and relaxed 
when you waken ten minutes from 
this time. 

He finished the waking-formula 
mechanically and left the little 
room. He walked slowly and de- 
liberately to his quarters on the 
base, as though holding himself 
rigidly in control. He did not an- 
swer Banning’s excited questions 
except to say, “I can’t talk about 
it now.” 

Reaching his room he fell full 
length on the bed and was asleep 
nearly before the swaying of the 
bed had quieted.

EVERAL HOURS later he was 
again in General Banning’s of- 
fice. 

“Look,” Banning said, “I’m sor- 
ry to press this, and I know you

took a hell of a beating in there. 
But we’ve got to know.” 

Colin nodded morosely. “I know. 
I’m sorry about the delay.” 

“You looked more dead than 
alive when you came out.” 

“I’m afraid I’m too long on 
empathy and too short on objectivi- 
ty to fool with that kind of thing. 
One of the reasons I don’t often 
trigger these big discharges in my 
own practice. I get — inside, I guess, 
somehow. No detachment, or not 
enough.” 

“What was there? Inside, if 
that’s the way you want to put it.” 
Colin sighed, absently pulled his 
pipe from his jacket pocket. “Spe- 
cifically, I don’t think I can tell you. 
He saw — or experienced as seeing 
— something when he went into 
the Skip. It was something so 
damned big it stripped him of his 
orientation as a human being.” 
“The films show him assuming a 
foetal position. That what you 
mean?” 

“Well — basically this kind of 
regression is a denial of responsi- 
bility. ‘I’m not a man,’ he says. 
‘I’m just an unborn child. Take 
care of me.’ The individual wants 
no part of the problems and re- 
sponsibilities of adulthood. Har- 
kins came out of that, or he never 
could have got the ship back. But 
he couldn’t face being a man. The 
only way he could carry out his 
responsibilities, and survive, was to 
abolish the category, man.” 

Colin leaned back and sighed. 
“You know,” he said thoughtfully, 
“Harkins must be the loneliest hu- 
man being that ever lived. God!” 
After a moment he looked up. 

AD. 2110: MAN ALONE 



“Ever read any Emerson?” 

“The philosopher Emerson? No, 
not much. Some maybe, when I 
was in college. Why?” 

“Nothing in particular. I was 
just thinking of an essay of his on 
Nature.” 

“No, haven’t read it. Well,” he 
continued, standing, “where do we 
go from here?” 

“More of the same, I’m afraid. 
We have to find out what he saw. 
What was so — immense, that it 
could make a man deny the ex- 
istence of other men.” 

Night came to Gila Base IV ; the 
second night after the Phoenix Ps 
landing. Darkness climbed out of 
the eastern hills and spread itself 
upward into the sky and across the 
plane of the desert. Phoenix 1 was 
still on the landing pad, but its 
sides were hidden by a webwork of 
ganties and scaffolding as base tech- 
nicians clambered over it, testing, 
checking, examining. 

Colin insisted on leaving the 
base, making the twenty-mile drive 
into town and his home. Banning 
was too tired to argue about it. He 
gave the psychiatrist a security gate- 
pass and went to bed in his own 
office. 

Colin’s car buzzed down the wide 
concrete toward the little cluster of 
lights that marked Gila City. He 
slowed when he reached the out- 
skirts, watching the blue glare of 
the overhead sodium lamps slide 
along the hood and up over the 
windshield. 

Reaching his apartment, he 
flicked on the lights and went in. It 
was a single room, two walls covered 



41 




with floor- to-ceiling bookcases; 
there was a desk, one overstuffed 
chair. Automatically his eyes swept 
the room with the questioning 
glance of a man returning home; 
they lingered apprehensively on the 
neat stack of unopened mail the 
cleaning woman had put on the 
exact corner of the desk. He sighed. 
No matter how preoccupied a man 
got, the rest of the world went on 
just the same. 

He went into the little kitchen- 
ette and made himself a cup of in- 
stant coffee, returned to the main 
room stirring it absently. He seated 
himself heavily in the overstuffed 
chair. 

Struck by a sudden thought, he 
put the coffee down on the edge of 
his desk and went over to one 
book-wall. He scanned the multi- 
colored spines until he found the 
thin paperback he was looking for. 
He took it down and went back to 
the chair. “Nature,” the cover 
said, “by Ralph Waldo Emerson.” 

Laying the little pamphlet open 
in his lap, he pulled pipe and to- 
bacco out of his jacket pocket, 
tamped the bowl full and lit it. He 
shifted himself easily in the chair, 
settling himself. 

Our Age is retrospective, the in- 
troduction began. It builds the 
sepulchers of the fathers . 

He read on, gliding over the fa- 
miliar words with a pleasant sense 
of acquaintanceship, the sense of 
sharing an idea with a respected 
friend. 

To go into solitude, a man needs 
to retire as much from his cham- 
ber as from society. 1 am not sol- 
itary whilst 1 read and write, 



though nobody is with me. 

The next line of the essay made 
him sit up straight in the chair. He 
read it over twice, then closed the 
pamphlet and carefully put it back 
in the bookcase with a vague feel- 
ing of having been either betrayed 
or helped, he couldn’t tell which. 

As he was turning out the lights 
to go to bed, his com buzzed. An- 
swering it, he recognized the voice 
of Banning’s secretary. 

“Mr. Meany, can you get back to 
the base right away? Something’s 
happened.” 

“What is it?” Colin snapped. 

“The Colonel has gotten back 
into Phoenix I” 

“. understand exactly how 
it happened,” Banning said. “He 
seemed to be sleeping peacefully, 
and one of the men vyent in the 
room to take out his garbage, for 
Christ’s sake. When the door 
opened, he made a dash for it.” 

The two men stood in the con- 
trol room before the wide window- 
wall looking out on the landing 
pad. Phoenix 1 , still surrounded by 
scaffolding, was brightly lit in the 
glaring beams of a dozen search- 
lights playing from the Gila Base 
buildings and trucks on the field. 

“Can he take it off?” Colin 
asked. 

“I don’t think so,” Banning said. 
“Sergeant, is there fuel in those 
tanks?” 

“Yes, sir,” said one of the men 
in the group that crowded in front 
of the window. “But the feed valve 
is off. It can’t get into the firing 
chambers.” 

“What would happen if he

42 




tried?” Colin asked. 

“Nothing,” Banning said. “It 
wouldn’t fire. Unless — unless he 
didn’t pay any attention to the 
board, and left his hotpoints on 
after he saw it wouldn’t fire.” 
“What are hotpoints?” 

“The ignition elements. They’d 
melt down under continuous heat- 
ing and — well, then we wouldn’t 
have any more problem. The tanks 
would go.” 

“You’d better clear the field,” 
Colin said quietly after a minute. 
“Sergeant,” he said to the radio- 
man, “would you give the Phoenix 
a ‘message coming’ beep?” 

The radioman did. then said to 
Colin, “Go ahead.” 

“Is he receiving?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Colonel Harkins,” Colin said. 
“Colonel Harkins, can you hear 
me?” 

The loudspeakers buzzed. 
“Colonel Harkins, please reply.” 
The speakers snapped once. The 
sound of Harkins’ whistle came 
over, loud at first, then drifting 
away. He was whisding the same 
tune as before. 

. had a true wife but 1 left 
her , oh, oh, oh, oh . .” 

“Do you want her back again?” 
Banning asked, recognizing the 
melody. 

“Colonel Harkins, please reply,” 
Colin said. Switching the mike off, 
he turned to Banning. “Better get 
her,” he said. “We may have to go 
through the whole thing again.” 

It took twelve minutes by the 
control clock before they heard the 
door of the room open, and the

light tapping of Martha Harkins’ 
feet. Banning and Colin turned 
away from the window to greet 
her. 

Suddenly their shadows were 
thrown violently ahead of them, 
leaping across the floor and up the 
opposite wall like frightened an- 
imals trying to escape. 

They swung back to the window, 
their words of greeting still unspok- 
en. For perhaps a half second they 
could make out the upper part of 
Phoenix I, standing above the ugly 
glare like the nose of a whale 
thrusting up through a sea of boil- 
ing flame. Then it disappeared, and 
the fire-ball climbed suddenly into 
the night sky, rolling and twisting 
in on itself. A gantry tipped and 
fell out of the flame with ponderous 
slowness, twisted and melted before 
it crashed to the pad. Then the un- 
bearable glare died, and the search- 
lights played on an opaque black 
column of smoke, redly lit from 
within, standing where Phoenix 1 
had stood. 

The roar that shook the building 
seemed to come much too late. 



C OLIN SLUMPED disconso- 
lately in the control room, 
staring blankly out at the clusters 
of beetle-like trucks clustered 
around the landing pad, with their 
feathery antennae caressing the 
stack of still-burning wreckage. 
Washed down by the foam trucks, 
the fire would soon be out. But 
there would be little advantage to 
it, except to clear the pad. 

“How’s Mrs. Harkins?” he asked 
without turning as he heard foot- 



43 




steps behind him. 

“Under sedation/ 5 General Ban- 
ning said. He came to stand beside 
the psychiatrist, looked with him at 
the firecrew’s activity, so disorgan- 
ized and insect-like at a distance. 

“They’ll have it out pretty soon,” 
he said unnecessarily. 

“Mm.” 

Both men were silent. After a 
while, Colin tamped in fresh to- 
bacco and lit his pipe, sending up 
cottony puffs of smoke. 

“What do we do now?” he said 
absently. 

General Banning sighed. 

“See that hangar?” he asked, ges- 
turing to a tall building perhaps a 
quarter mile away down the edge of 
the field. 

Colin nodded. 

“Phoenix 11” the General said, 
and his voice was flat and expres- 
sionless. 

“Send another man into it, know- 
ing no more than we know?” 

“We have to know,” Banning 
said. “Men have died before with- 



out* as good reason.” 

“I’m going home. Call me if you 
need me.” 

Colin stood, and the general 
made a silent gesture of helpless- 
ness. They wouldn’t need him. Not 
until Phoenix 11 came home. Then 
they would need him. 

Colin spoke, quietly, as if think- 
ing of something else. 

“I didn’t hear you,” Banning 
said. 

“Quoting Emerson. The essay on 
Nature I mentioned.” 

“What did he say?” 

“ ‘But if a man would be alone/ ” 
Colin quoted, “ ‘let him look at the 
stars/ Good night, General.” 
“Good night.” 

- Colin walked outside into the 
cold desert air. The night was clear 
and crisp, and the Milky Way 
hurled itself like a mass of vapor 
across the sky. 

. if a man would be alone , let 
him look at the stars . 

He looked up, and was alone in 
the night. END

“Is this a trick?” 



A TOOTHACHE ON ZENOB 



By BOYD ELLANBEE 



Strange to think that from T>EHN KARN sat in the signal 

JL dome, idly waiting while his 
twenty-odd light-years away y friend adjusted the dials of the 

receiver. The recording tape spilled 
other eyes see our own Sun over the table in loops of alumi- 
num. 

blazing in the middle of a “Doesn’t this job get dull?” he 

inquired. 

familiar constellation . Nautunal turned the fifth dial 





a few degrees, and glanced up. 
“Depends on your interest. It’s true 
this is just routine space-sweep, 
but noise from space is amazingly 
variegated. Just one more sector 
to scan tonight, and I’ll be through. 
What’s matter with you, Pehn? 
Your face looks little lopsided.” 

Pehn tried to grin, and fingered 
the slight swelling on his cheek. 
“My face will never be my fortune, 
I guess. I don’t know what’s matter. 
Just ache.” 

Even at his best, as Pehn’s fami- 
ly loved to remind him, he was 
an ugly young man; he had none 
of the rounded placidity of feature 
which was the ideal of his race. 
His oHve skin stretched too tight- 
ly over his cheekbones, and his 
black eyes peered too intensely from 
their deep sockets. It helped very 
little that he happened to be ex- 
tremely intelligent. 

Pehn covered the aching place 
with his hand, and tried to con- 
centrate on the emerging spills of 
tape. As a matter of fact, he had 
been having severe periodic tooth- 
aches for six months now, but had 
never spoken of it. 

Suddenly he bent forward. “Hold 
it! Just minute. Let me see that.” 

Nautunal raised one eyebrow. 
“Don’t let it get you, lad. Listen- 
ing to space is apt to make you 
jumpy. Your friends over at 
Atomics wouldn’t like that. More 
than once I’ve thought I was find- 
ing some sort of sense in all this 
chatter, but it never pans out. It’s 
just noise. There may be other in- 
habited planets besides Zenob, just 
as Bidagha claims, but if so, they 
aren’t talking.” 

46 



“Stop, watch tape,” said Pehn. 
Nautunal shrugged his shoulders, 
but he picked up the tape and 
watched as it trickled through his 
fingers. 

The machine was recording short 
bursts of energy, separated by dis- 
tinct pauses: “ 



» 

“Two and two,” remarked Pehn, 
“are four. Three and three are six. 
Four — ” 

“I know. I’ve been to kindergar- 
ten too. Four and four are eight. 
Has your aching face affected your 
mind? You ought to submit your- 
self for treatment.” 

He reached to shift the scanner, 
but Pehn grabbed his hand. 

“Can’t you see? Somebody is 
trying to show us they know how 
to add. Someone out in space. Keep 
watching. I wonder if they use 
duodecimal system, or what? 
Where is it coming from?” 

Nautunal dropped his skeptical 
pose, and watched the emerging 
tape in silence. The growing table 
of symbols built all the simple ad- 
ditions up to 10 plus 10, by the 
laborious accumulation of dots. 
Then it began again, systematical- 
ly, “One and one are two, two and 
two — ” 

Pehn turned his wondering eyes 
on his friend. “Is this trick? Joke 
you rigged up for my benefit?” 

Nautunal shook his head, and 
his voice was hardly a whisper. 
“No. That stuff is really coming 
through space — through phase 
space.” 

Twice more, the table of ad- 
ditions appeared. Then, after a 

BOYD ELLANBEE 




brief pause, came simple multipli- 
cations. Hour after hour the sig- 
nals continued, endlessly repeated, 
and shortly after midnight the two 
could recognize the periodic table 
of chemical elements, with atomic 
weights and numbers of isotopes. 

“If those numbers which follow 
atomic weights are abundances,” 
said Pehn, “composition of their 
planet is not quite same as ours. 
Look how rare 235 is. Where do 
you suppose this is coming from?” 

“You guess,” said Nautunal. He 
waved his arm towards the trans- 
parent dome through which the 
stars shone, and grinned. “From 
little data I have so far, signals 
might be coming from somewhere 
in Weaver, perhaps from neighbor- 
hood of Topaz, but it’s too early 
to be sure of anything.” 

Suddenly a marked change oc- 
curred in the pattern of the signals. 
The clear symmetry of mathematics 
ended and was replaced by a form- 
less jumble, but a jumble whose 
repetition suggested that it, too, 
contained a pattern if it could once 
be glimpsed. Meters and meters 
of tape piled up, and the young 
men stared at it in frustration. 

Nautunal stood up in sudden de- 
cision. “Bidagha is right. There 
must be intelligent life in another 
part of galaxy. We need help, 
Pehn. We can’t decipher this stuff, 
and yet it may be key to basic vo- 
cabulary. We need mathematicians, 
linguists, semanticists. I’ll put out 
call to director.” He lifted a finger 
to activate the visiphone in his 
wrist band, but before touching it 
he glanced at his friend in some 
concern. 



“But you don’t look well. Per- 
haps you ought to go home and 
get some sleep?” 

Pehn shook his head. “No, pain 
will probably be gone by morning, 
and at time like this sleep would 
be only gift from Evil Ones. I’m 
going to get Bidagha. He’ll be more 
use to us than dozen semanticists.” 
“Call him on visiphone.” 

“You know he can’t wear one. 
He’s at Cave tonight, holding 
Ceremony. I’ll go after him.” 
“All right, Pehn. But remember, 
government will probably disap- 
prove of this business. Whatever 
you do — don’t tell your father!” 
Pehn grounded his copter at the 
outskirts of the city, then turned 
his back to the glowing lights and 
walked north across the darkened 
fields towards Cave. The early 
morning sky blazed with stars, and 
ahead of him, low on the northern 
horizon, gleamed the sprawling 
constellation of Weaver. He had 
never been able to force his ima- 
gination to see many of the con- 
stellations in their completeness, 
and in the patterns of stars which 
his pastoral ancestors had con- 
ceived as Weaver, Sower, Homed 
Toth, he could see only random 
clusters of suns. He watched it 
now, as he walked over the rutted 
earth, and suddenly the pattern 
took shape, so that he could dis- 
cern the old lady’s Shuttle, and at 
its tip that brilliant yellow star, 
Topaz, which might that very mo- 
ment be sending its signals through 
the galaxy. How many planets re- 
volved around Topaz? 

He stopped, for the field ended 
in a sharp bluff which descended 

47 



A.D. 2120: A TOOTHACHE ON ZENOB 




to a narrow valley. Across the val- 
ley’s floor was the entrance to Cave. 
He could see the bobbing lights 
of candles, down there, and hear 
a muffled chant of many voices. He 
hoped Ceremony would end, soon, 
so that he could consult his friend. 
Once again he felt impatient that 
Bidagha should have to be met in 
person just because, as a Healer, 
he could not wear a visiphone in- 
to Cave. Bidagha was really more 
progressive than many scientists. 
But the culture of Zenob still had 
a strongly anti-materialistic, one 
might almost say anti-scientific 
tinge, and no machine of any kind 
could ever be brought into any of 
Sacred Places. Cave had been the 
ehief place for the ceremonies of 
those living in Lahzen area for so 
many thousands of years, that even 
the historians did not know of a 
time when it was not in use. It 
was so old, some heretics said, that 
it had outlived its usefulness, and 
was not even a safe place to be in. 

The stars were fading, and the 
northern sky was paling when the 
chanting stopped in Cave below. 
People filed out silently, extinguish- 
ing their candles as they reached 
the opening, and last of all came 
the Healer. 

“Bidagha!” Pehn called softly. 
“Up here!” 

The tall figure paused, then ran 
lightly up the steps out in the 
sloping hill. 

“Has something happened?” 

“Hurry. My copter is waiting 
back there, and I’ll take you to 
signal dome. Then I’ll have to go 
home. If I’m not there for break- 
fast, my father will begin another 

48 



lecture on depravity of youth.” 
Bidagha’s eyes twinkled. “Pre- 
mier Karn is pretty conscious of 
his responsibilities to nation, Pehn, 
but perhaps eighteen years ought 
to be more respectful of fifty. I am 
nearly lafter myself, you know. But 
what has happened?” 

Pehn raised his arm and pointed 
towards Weaver. “We’re getting 
signals. We think maybe they come 
from some planet of Topaz.” 
Bidagha clasped his strong hands 
on his breast. His black hair, curl- 
ing over a high, olive forehead, 
was held in place by the narrow 
green band of his calling. Under 
his little mustache his mouth was 
firm and serene, and his gray eyes 
were exalted as he stared at the 
fading yellow star. 

“At last!” he said. 



HE BLUISH SUN of Zenob 
had risen by the time Pehn 
got home. He sat through the 
family breakfast with his parents 
and his sister, thankful that his 
night’s absence had apparently not 
been noticed. 

Pehn’s father, old Premier Kam, 
represented, the old man liked to 
think, the ideal of Zenobian ma- 
turity. The placidity of his mind 
was reflected in the soft roundness 
of his unlined face, and his full 
lips curved at the corners in per- 
petual contentment. Like most of 
his countrymen, he had never felt 
any conflict between his own im- 
pulses and the customs of his 
society, and never in his life had 
he needed the ministrations of a 
Healer. 




BOYD ELLANBEE 




In his usual benevolent mood 1 
this morning, Premier Kam enter- ) 
tained his family with his medita- a 
tions on his favorite theme, the 
glories of Zenob’s history and the s 
perfection of her knowledge. They s 
listened to his remarks in patient t 
silence. As he sipped at his last c 
cup of fragrant akhlai , he tried to $ 
make a kindly remark to his son. i 
“And what progress is your in- 
stitute making towards practical i 
atomic power, Pehn? Foundations < 
of this work were laid down more 1 
than two hundred years ago, and 1 
government would be glad to have \ 
demonstration at any time. 55 ] 

“We’re little uncertain, sir, when 1 
that will be. We want to be sure, s 
before our first trial, that we have i 
checked against even vaguest pos- i 
sibility of starting widespread chain i 
reaction.” \ 

The Premier frowned, set down < 
his cup, and touched his napkin 1 
to his lips. “But how could this i 
occur?” < 

“It is not at all likely. But if, for j 
example, as has been suggested, j 
crust of our planet should contain J 
large quantities of some heavy ele- 1 
ment with properties we don’t 1 

know about, something related to s 
235 or 238 for instance, and easily i 
fissionable, our very first trial might i 
prove disastrous.” 1 

“Nonsense, nonsense!” said the i 
Premier. “Complete chemistry of 1 
our planet was worked out and 1 
tabulated more than three hundred 1 
years ago. There were great chem- ] 
istr in those days, and since then i 
no further research has ever been 
necessary. There could not possibly j 
be any elements which we don’t

know about. It is not seemly for 
you young men to be questioning 
work of great geniuses of past.” 

Pehn’s sister, Soma, had been 
silent, as befitted a woman. Now 
she said, “Father, I have been told 
that long time ago, Sarkar Talat, 
after life spent in philosophical re- 
search, gave Warning to govern- 
ment — ” 

“Trouble with you, my dear,” 
and the Premier patted his pretty 
daughter’s arm, “is that you don’t 
realize women usually lack spirit- 
ual insight necessary to interpret 
veiled words of Ancients. Of course 
I admit our Healers can foresee 
future, but they don’t always de- 
scribe it in unambiguous language. 
Actually, Sarkar issued two Warn- 
ings, but they obviously did not 
mean what they seem to at first 
glance. First was, that we are in 
danger because we only think we 
have mastered all basic knowledge. 
Second was, that there are un- 
doubtedly other worlds in universe, 
and one of them will one day af- 
fect destiny of Zenob. Taken at 
face value, these are obviously 
both false. As to first, no new 
knowledge has been added to our 
sciences for generations, in spite of 
fact that Ainta ages ago showed 
us how to use faculty of precogni- 
tion. As to second, it is clearly 
foolish to think Sarkar meant other 
worlds in physical sense. He must 
have meant spiritual worlds.” He 
turned again to Pehn, who had 
risen from the table and was wait- 
ing politely. 

“When can we have that demon- 
stration? Within month?” 

“I’ll speak to director today, 



49 




sir.” The throbbing in his cheek was 
becoming evident again, and he 
touched his face gently. 

“What’s matter, Pehn?” said his 
mother. 

“Nothing. My face hurts, little.” 

“Ignore it!” his father ordered. 
“I won’t have any maladjustment 
in Lord Karn’s family!” He picked 
up the gold-headed cane which 
was his badge of office, and strode 
out of the room. 

Pehn managed to spend a second 
night with the sleepless group of 
experts at the signal dome, but 
fatigue, and the growing pain in 
his cheek sent him home again 
just before dawn. Softly he ran up 
the ramp to the second floor and 
into his bathroom, to the medicine 
closet 

In Pehn’s family, a transient ill- 
ness was an embarrassment, a per- 
sistent illness a disgrace. It had al- 
ways been his mother’s pride, and 
his father’s boast, that in the Karn 
household the contents of the medi- 
cine shelves were never needed, 
and that the doors of the cupboard 
remained closed from one year to 
the next. 

It was with a sense of guilt, then, 
that Pehn pressed a spot on the 
green-tiled wall to slide back the 
cupboard doors, and picked up an 
ivory box, from which he took a 
bolus of pain-killing plant extract. 

He swallowed the huge pill, 
then took another. A double dose, 
this time, for he knew the pain 
would never yield to anything less. 
He stood shivering for a few mo- 
ments, waiting for the drug to 
take effect. He looked up, and 
realized that his sister was stand- 

50 



ing at the open door, watching 
him sympathetically. 

“Pehn,” she said, “you’re ill. 
Won’t you talk it over with me?” 

“I would talk it over with one 
of Evil Ones if I thought it would 
help this pain. It grows worse and 
worse.” 

“Have you told Father yet? He 
could arrange for Healer — ” 

“No!” he shouted. “I don’t want 
him to know. He’d only begin 
lecture on his shame, his gray hairs, 
how all pain comes from unruly 
mind, why don’t I put myself in 
tune with group — old familiar 
story. But I know this is something 
different.” 

“But Pehn! You know yourself, 
surely, that since you’ve got into 
Atomics Institute, you have 
changed. You aren’t perfectly ad- 
justed, any more. You worry about 
things.” 

He touched his swollen face 
and smiled at her placatingly. 

“Don’t worry, Soma, or you’ll 
get lines in your forehead, and 
Father could never bear shame of 
having two maladjusted children 
in family. I’m stronger than you 
think. Last year when I passed Fire 
Test, I stood flames longer than 
any of boys in my class, longer 
even than Nautunal. But this is dif- 
ferent. Trouble with Zenob is that 
we don’t have any biology or any 
real medicine.” 

“Pehn! How can you say such 
things? Your best friend is Healer.” 

“You know I haven’t anything 
against Healers. But only ailments 
they can cure are those that origi- 
nate in mind, and they can’t really 
do anything for purely physical 

BOYD ELLANBEE 




ailments. Bidagha has admitted as 
much to me. He wants to change all 
that — he thinks time is ripe.” 

“But Pehn, our Healers can fore- 
see future. You know that Ainta 
Penab proved that, five centuries 
ago.” 

“Ainta was worst disaster that 
ever befell Zenob,” shouted Pehn. 

He put out his hand to restrain his 
sister, who was attempting to strug- 
gle to her feet in horror. 

“Oh, Soma, I guess I’m just 
heretic. But listen to me. Sure 
Ainta Penab proved conclusively 
that such phenomena as telepathy 
and precognition are real. And 
what was result? Members of Cult 
used it as argument and launched 
campaign to stop scientific research 
completely. They nearly succeeded, 
too. Medical research has never 
been resumed on any large scale, 
and chemistry and physics only in 
last century.” 

Soma sighed. “You shouldn’t 
get all excited, Pehn. Come down 
into living room, and stretch out 
on couch. I’ll rub your forehead. 
You may be ugly old atavism but 
you’re only brother I have, and I 
want to keep you.” 

In the big living room, Soma 
drew the curtains from the lucite 
walls that looked over the white 
city. The early sunlight came in, 
warm and faintly blue, soothing. 
She put foam pillows under his 
aching head, and drew up a foot- 
stool beside him. She stroked his 
forehead and he was beginning to 
doze, lightly, when a muted chime 
roused him. 

He activated his wrist dial, to 
find Nautunal’s grave face looldng 

A.D. 2120: A TOOTHACHE ON ZENOB 



at him. Pehn sat up. 

“What have you found?” 
“Something. Can you come here, 
now?” 

Pehn struggled to his feet. “Just 
give me minute to clear my head.” 
“Don’t go, Pehn!” cried Soma. 
“You’re not well! It’s nearly break- 
fast time, too. Don’t go. What will 
I tell father?” 

But the door had closed, and 
from the window Soma watched 
Pehn’s copter rise above the roof- 
tops and glide out of sight. 

I N THE SIGNAL DOME Pehn 
found the specialists still at 
work, pale and tense from lack of 
sleep. Some still conferred over 
pages of mathematical equations, 
some watched the tape which mo- 
notonously continued to record the 
symbols. 

Bidagha strode forward to meet 
him. 

“We’ve finally found key to vo- 
cabulary, Pehn, and others are at 
work now on main body of message. 
Signals are undoubtedly coming 
from one of planets of sun we call 
Topaz. It has system of nine plan- 
ets, and waves are being sent from 
third. All my life I’ve believed that 
there were other planet systems like 
ours, and other intelligences in 
galaxy, but now that one of them 
is signalling us, I can hardly make 
myself believe it!” 

From the top gallery, high in 
the dome, Nautunal ran down the 
spiral ramp. 

“We’re getting it now, Bidagha! 
Planet of Topaz, is signalling this 
entire sector of galaxy, hoping to 

51 




find planets with intelligent life on 
them. They wish to communicate, 
to exchange information, and they 
offer to visit any planet which 
would welcome them.” 

“Then they can travel through 
space?” 

“Yes. They say they are only 
twenty-seven light-years away.” 
Bidagha’s shoulders drooped in 
disappointment. “But if these sig- 
nals have been twenty-seven years 
on way, it would take us another 
twenty-seven years to answer them. 
I shall never live to see their visit!” 
“But you don’t understand, 
Bidagha. I forgot this isn’t your 
field. These waves are coming 
through phase space, and they go 
much faster than speed of light. 
They reach us almost instanta- 
neously.” 

Pehn began to laugh. He felt 
light-headed, and for some reason 
amused. “I suppose you all re- 
member my father’s Jarlu lecture, 
in which he demonstrated mathe- 
matically that life or intelligence on 
any planet except Zenob was im- 
possible. He pointed out that 
unique properties of carbon com- 
pounds of which we are composed 
could never be duplicated on an- 
other planet. And how remarkable 
circumstance of our having Ice I, 
only form of solid water that can 
float, had allowed life to evolve on 
Zenob, alone. Poor father! This 
will be hard on him. Of course, 
you are not going to send answer?” 
Bidagha had seemed to be in 
meditation, but now he spoke in a 
commanding tone. “Of course we 
must reply!” 

Nautunal gasped, and stepped 

52 



away. “But we haven’t right! That 
would be heresy!” 

“I claim right. Centuries ago, 
Healers dreamed of this day, and 
as Healer I dare to claim right. We 
will reply to these signals and tell 
people of Topaz planet that intel- 
ligent men do exist on our own 
world.” 

Nautunal’s eyes had become 
dreamy and speculative. “I am not 
certain that we could reply, even if 
we dared,” he said. He looked un- 
certainly at the other microwave 
technicians, to see fear looking 
from their faces, too. 

At last one spoke. “/ think we 
could change over to transmission 
through phase space in about half 
hour — if we had orders.” He hast- 
ily turned away, afraid of his own 
thoughts. 

“Responsibility is mine,” said 
Bidagha. “I speak with authority 
of my calling. We will send same 
set of mathematical tables we have 
received, and then periodic table 
of elements as they exist here.” 

Pehn felt confused, battered with 
warring emotions, and too tired to 
think or speak. But Nautunal 
moved with abrupt decision. 

“If you order it, Bidagha, we will 
try.” He turned to his technicians. 
“We’ll start work immediately.” 

Nearly an hour had passed be- 
fore the wave modulator was re- 
ported ready. In the highest level 
of the dome, they watched nerv- 
ously as Nautunal turned up the 
power and worried the dials. 

“All set?” he said. 

There was no reply. In a dead 
silence he touched the button, and 
started an impulse driving towards 

BOYD ELLANBEE 




the star Topaz. 

The door behind them opened 
with a crash and Premier Karn 
strode in, his face contorted with 
an anger he had never shown be- 
fore in his life. 

“Despicable traitors!” he shout- 
ed. “Turn off that instrument!” 

White-faced, one of the techni- 
cians obeyed, and the power indi- 
cators dropped. 

“Can it be true, what has come 
to my ears — what I see now with 
my own eyes — that you would 
dare to reply to message that comes 
from foreign planet?” 

Bidagha’s commanding figure 
grew even taller. 

“Premier, I speak now, not as 
Bidagha man, but as Bidagha 
Healer, and I must give you my 
Warning: Zenob cannot escape 

contacts with other worlds! 

“In my opinion, Zenob has 
reached fateful turning point in its 
history. We must face fact that 
our knowledge of physical science 
is not adequate. Our fossil fuels 
are nearly gone, and we must have 
atomic power. But frankly, our 
physicists don’t know enough to 
design safe atomic reactors. And at 
rate science progresses on Zenob, 
they won’t know enough for cen- 
turies. All of this could be remedied 
by exchange of information with 
this other world.” 

As he faced Bidagha, the Pre- 
mier trembled with rage, and his 
usually placid face was contorted. 
“Bidagha, you could be unfrocked 
for that! Zenob would be better off 
if Healers would confine their opin- 
ions and activities to healing, and 
leave politics to those whose busi- 



ness it is. Government will not base 
its decisions upon visions of dream- 
ers who have dwelt too long in 
Cave.” 

Pehn closed his eyes as a wave of 
agony broke over him. The voices 
receded; dimly he was aware that 
he was falling. Pain and shouting 
together faded away into darkness. 



O N EARTH, at the listening 
post on Long Island, Joe 
Weber sat before his recorder, in- 
tent on the noise from space. 

The chief anthropologist studied 
the star map on the wall as he 
asked his question. “Have you got 
anything at all, Joe?” 

The technician shook his head. 
“Nothing but noise. I’ve only been 
beaming them for four days, and 
our schedule calls for a week on 
each sector. I’ll keep on as planned, 
but I’m positive that the star sys- 
tems in the Lyra sector are not in- 
habited in any sense we would 
recognize, or, if there is life there, 
it hasn’t developed enough of a 
science for them to know they’re 
being signalled.” 

The anthropologist sighed. “It 
may be a hopeless task. It may be 
several lifetimes before we locate 
systems similar to ours. I had hoped 
to find some in my day.” 

“Don’t be discouraged, profes- 
sor. I’ll start hitting Cygnus for 
you, and maybe we can find some- 
thing there. Yesterday, for a min- 
ute, I thought had something in 
Lyra. In the middle of the random 
noise, suddenly I came across what 
looked like ‘dot dot, dot dot, dot- 
dot- dot- dot, dot dot dot, dot dot 



A D. 2120: A TOOTHACHE ON ZENOB 



53 




dot — ’ It was clear as crystal, and 
much louder than the noise, but 
then it lapsed into the usual non- 
sense. Pure chance at work, of 
course, but for a minute there, my 
hair stood on end. Well, it’s all in 
the day’s work. I’ll just keep send- 
ing our stuff — ” 

“Of course,” said the anthro- 
pologist, “there might be intelligent 
people in the sector you’re working 
right now, but they might be like 
the Zuni.” 

“The Zuni?” asked Weber. 

“The Zuni are a large village of 
American Indians who live in New 
Mexico. Right next to what used 
to be a big Indian reservation for 
the Navahos. A typical inward- 
looking culture. Now the Navahos, 
although they still keep their own 
language and religion, are an out- 
ward-looking culture, interested in 
the rest of the world. The Zuni are 
not. For them the boundaries of 
the world are the walls of Zuni vil- 
lage. They wouldn’t bother to 
listen to a message from outer 
space, much less reply.” 

“Can’t be very bright.” said Joe. 

“On the contrary. Some of them 
have made the highest scores on the 
Tromovich intelligence test that 
have ever been recorded. It’s not a 
matter of intelligence, but the at- 
titude of the culture.” 

“Well,” said Joe, “let’s hope 
most of the worlds of space have 
outward-looking cultures.” He 
turned back to his transmitter. 



P EHN FOUND himself lying 
on a couch. He tried to get up, 
and felt his father’s hands at his 

54 



shoulders restraining him. 

“Don’t move, Pehn,” said his 
mother. “You fainted, and they 
brought you home.” She lifted his 
head, and let him sip a cup of the 
hot akhlai. 

After a time his father addressed 
him with unusual kindness. 

“We cannot 'delay any longer, 
Pehn. Your mother and sister and 
I are all agreed. You must under- 
go Ceremony. What is proper thing 
to do for you, I don’t know, but 
Bidagha believes he can help you. 
This crisis in our world is making 
us all ill, and it is no wonder that 
you, being young, should suffer 
more acutely than rest of us.” 
Pehn tried to laugh. “Would 
you trust me to Bidagha?” 

“Yes, I would. Although his 
views on world affairs are perverse 
and dangerous he is good Healer, 
and he has your best interests at 
heart.” 

“Your son is very ill, Lord Karn. 
If I am able to help him, would 
you be willing to consider possibili- 
ty, at least, that wisdom of Healer 
is not confined to human body 
alone?” * 

Premier Karn brushed his hand 
across his eyes. In the last few days 
he had suddenly become an old 
man, and his mouth was drawn 
and tense. “I cannot tell, Bidagha. 
I am tired, and confused. I no 
longer seem to be sure what is 
true, and what is right.” 

Pehn opened his eyes to speak 
to Bidagha. “Do you think you 
can cure me, by Ceremony alone?” 
“I have cured people who were 
much more ill than you are, but 
your case is serious because you 

BOYD ELLANBEE 




have delayed so long. It may be 
that we should not rely on ritual 
alone, and that it would be wiser 
to use knife.” 

Lord Karn gasped with horror. 
“Never! Have you lost faith in your 
own art?” 

“Of course none of us like to 
use knife, since very few minds are 
skilled enough to control infection 
likely to follow. No, first we shall 
hold Ceremony just as our tradi- 
tions counsel us. Tonight.” 

The muted chime of the visi- 
phone interrupted them. The Pre- 
mier touched his wrist and the 
gaunt face of Nautunal appeared 
in the dial. 

“ 'Signals have entered new stage, 
sir. Message coming at present 
states that Topaz planet wishes to 
visit any planet inhabited by in- 
telligent race. They say they have 
phase space drive for spaceships, 
but in all their searching have not 
found even one inhabited world. 
They say they want to know that 
they are not alone in universe.” 

The Premier’s face worked. “I 
cannot say what is right. Later. I 
will decide after Ceremony. Are 
you ready, Pehn?” 

Pehn covered his face with his 
folded arms. 

“All right,” he whispered. “Soon- 
er, better.” 

Deep in the valley north of the 
city. Cave yawned. For thousands 
of years its narrow mouth had been 
open to the Healers and the par- 
ticipants in the ceremonial ritual. 
The age of Cave was unknown, 
some said as old as the planet it- 
self. Great rocks formed the inner 



walls, which ascended to a low 
domed ceiling, and occasionally a 
handful of gravel trickled down 
the walls to the bottom where a 
small stream still worked at hollow- 
ing out the stone. 

At the back of Cave was the 
hearth, and across the floor were 
ancient stone benches waiting for 
the friends and family of the pa- 
tient, for by tradition, only patient 
and Healer approached the hearth 
itself. The others, whose wills and 
hearts were to unite, for one brief 
night, to heal the sickness, sat apart 
in a broad circle, where they could 
see the ceremony, and the chant of 
their voices could float back to the 
ears of the sufferer. 

As the sun set, Pehn was car- 
ried into Cave on a litter. 

His father and mother, his sister, 
his father’s collaborators in the 
government, and representatives of 
the whole community filed down 
the valley to the entrance where 
Bidagha stood, and each person, 
clad for this occasion only in a robe 
of animal fur, as he approached 
the opening extended his hands to 
show that he had removed his 
wrist band, and lifted his arms to 
show that no material product of 
modem technology was being taken 
inside to profane Cave. They all 
respected the ancient proverb, 
“What Immortals want new, they 
make new.” Each one lit his candle 
at Bidagha’s flame, and silently 
took his place in the circle. 

Pehn had not been inside Cave 
since his early childhood, but it 
seemed a familiar place, since its 
description formed a part of many 
of Zenob’s myths, and was part of 



A.D. 2120: A TOOTHACHE ON ZENOB 



55 




all her history. 

The age-old figures scratched on 
the walls and filled in with colored 
earths, had been made by his re- 
mote ancestors at a time when their 
only weapons were the bows and 
arrows pictured there, and the 
stone-tipped spears with which 
they hunted their game. In the 
flickering light of the fi^ he could 
recognize the lithe toda, and the 
great-tusked khalmat, animals 
which had been extinct for many 
ages. How vividly Old Ones had 
portrayed these animals, and the 
ritual of their hunts! The wood 
fire, which Bidagha had kindled 
with a primitive wooden drill, 
burned on the hearth, and above 
his head through a rift in the ceil- 
ing, Pehn could see a narrow band 
of sky and a sprinkling of stars. 

“Keep your head pointed 
towards fire,” said Bidagha, “and 
lie quiet. Ritual has no value un- 
less we observe it strictly.” He gave 
Pehn a warm potion from an earth- 
enware cup, which made him feel 
sleepy. 

Bidagha began to chant, his 
bass voice reverberating from wall 
to wall, each syllable a sonorous 
musical note which was answered 
at intervals by the watching group 
of well-wishers. 

A wooden bowl filled with coarse- 
ly ground grain was passed from 
one person to another, and each 
one placed a few grains on his 
tongue, some on his forehead, and 
threw a token punch of the flour 
over his left shoulder. 

An hour passed, two; the stars 
above shifted their position, and 
still Bidagha chanted, never hesi- 

56 



tating, never stumbling over the 
archaic words. Midnight passed and 
the stars grew pale. 

Through the roaring in his ears, 
Pehn heard the Healer kneel on the 
rock floor beside him; then he felt 
Bidagha’s strong fingers on his 
shoulder. 

“How is it with you, my son?” 
Pehn groaned, unable to speak. 
The pain was not alleviated — 
it was greater then ever. 

The soles of Bidagha’s sandals 
scraped as he stood up again. 
“Bring knife!” he called. 

In his roaring darkness, Pehn 
stirred. Vaguely he sensed the mur- 
muring of the watchers. Then 
someone else came near, and 
Bidagha’s voice rose again. “Im- 
mortals, bless knife!” 

Fingers pried open his jaw, 
probed at the misshapen gum, 
sending fiery flashes of agony into 
his brain. Then a hard edge of pain 
struck, cutting, releasing a flood of 
warm wetness in his mouth. Yet 
it all seemed to be happening far 
away. 

He sensed Bidagha bending near 
once more. “Boy is going fast. In- 
fection is deep.” 

Another voice: “Move him to 
experimental hospital?” 

“He would not live to get there.” 
A pause. “Go, bring forceps and 
bone knives. Hurry.” 

A long roaring darkness. Then 
new movement around where he 
lay: and a sudden voice that he 
dimly recognized as his father’s. 

“Stop! What is that tool in your 
hand?” 

“A new device for extracting 
teeth,” came Bidagha’s calm, reso- 

BOYD ELLANBEE 




nant voice: “with which we may 
save your son’s life.” 

Shocked murmurs all over the 
hall, topped by his father’s shout 
of outrage, “In Cave — in hands of 
Healer?” 

Bidagha replied, “What Im- 
mortals want new, they make new! 
Here and now, in my hands, they 
end our years of darkness! Let 
Immortals confound me if I lie!” 



HE MULTITUDE in Cave 
roared their approval, and 
Premier Kam hesitated. He ap- 
peared to be struggling within him- 
self. As the echoes died away, a 
pebble rolled from a ledge, dis- 
lodged by the sound, and fell at 
Bidagha’s feet. A second pebble 
fell, and a boulder which had 
rested above the hearth for un- 
told centuries shifted its position. 

With a shout, Bidagha flung 
himself over Pehn’s body as the 
boulder trembled and fell, crush- 
ing the life from the bodies of both 
men. 

Dust rose, and a rumble began 
near the ceiling. 

“Run!” cried Premier Kam. 
“Run for your lives!” 

As the others ran from Cave, 
Lord Karn rushed to the huge rock 
lying upon his son, but he had no 
hope. Neither Pehn nor Bidagha 
would ever move again. 

A trickle of sand pattered to 
the floor, and with a last back- 
ward glance Lord Kam ran from 
Cave. Boulders rained from the 
ceiling. The Premier had just 
reached the outside when a huge 
slab of rock crashed to the floor 



against the entrance. On the slope 
nearby, Pehn’s mother and sister 
wept silently. 

Lord Karn stood motionless a 
long while. At last he spoke. 

“Cave is sealed,” he said. “Let 
it never be opened again. Im- 
mortals have willed that my son 
should rest here forever, with im- 
pious Bidagha.” Turning his face 
to the sky, he shook his fist at the 
bright spark of Topaz in the paling 
north. “So much for new things 
and foreign stars!” he said between 
his teeth. “This day’s evil is 
enough.” 

They extinguished their candles 
and went slowly up the valley path 
towards the city. 

Twenty-eight years later, on 
Earth, an astronomer comparing 
recent plates taken of the constella- 
tion Lyra noticed that Vega, its 
brightest star, had increased in 
brightness by a slight amount. The 
event was not especially remark- 
able — there are on the average, 
twenty-five novas reported every 
year in our galaxy — but Vega was 
one of the stars to be visited during 
the next decade by one of the 
Survey ships now in mid-voyage. 

“There’s one place they won’t 
have to stop, now,” he said to a 
colleague, showing him the plates. 

“I don’t suppose it matters. 
What’s one star, more or less, when 
they all turn out to be the same — 
no planets, or barren ones — no 
stopping place for man.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” said 
the astronomer, staring glumly at 
the waste immensity of the photo- 
graph in front of him. END

A.D. 2150: 




SHANDY 



By 

RON GOULART 



Shandy was a teddy bear, 
a lion, an ape, a rival for 
Nancy Tanner’s affections 
. But what else was he? 



H olman came down out of 

the forest of giant orange- 
woods and trudged across the plain 
toward the place where Nancy Tan- 
ner lived. It was late afternoon and 
the woods beyond Nancy’s home 
were already growing dark and 
dim. 

The door of the old spaceship 
was open and a dark flowered rug 
hung over the rail of the gangway. 
Late sun glazed the round window 
near the door, but Holman thought

he had seen Nancy behind the 
strawberry-patterned curtains. 

Wearing a pale blue cotton dress, 
tan and slender, Nancy came out of 
the ship and into the low-trimmed 
grass. She held up one arm and 
waved once, smiling. “Ken,” she 
said and turned to roll up the rug. 

Holman said, “How you been?” 
as he came near, walking at his 
usual pace. 

Setting the rug carefully on the 
bottom step, Nancy looked up at 
him. “Fine. Yourself?” 

“Not bad. Had a cold last week.” 
Holman put his suitcase down next 
to the neatly rolled rug. 

Nancy frowned. “You still don’t 
eat enough greens. That’s Wffy.” 

Holman kissed her, his hands 
gentle on her back. “Well, here I 
am,” he said. 

“Well, come in and we’ll talk.” 
She stepped slowly away from him 
and went up into the ship. 

Holman gathered up his suit- 
case and the rolled rug and fol- 
lowed her. 

He looked in and all around the 
kitchen before he entered. 

Nancy watched him over her 
shoulder while she got two china 
cups. She grinned at him as he 
stepped into the room. 

“I left the rug and my grip in the 
hall,” Holman said and sat down in 
a straight-backed chair. Stooping to 
retie his hiking shoes, he glanced 
under the table. “Made it from the 
settlement in under four hours. Of 
course, I took big steps.” 

“Would you like rum or whisky 
or something like that in your 
coffee?” Nancy asked, touching the 
handle of the coffee pot. 



“School teachers don’t drink be- 
fore sundown.” 

“You’re on vacation.” 

“I’ll wait. You go ahead, 
though.” 

Nancy set a cup in front of him 
and backed away. “You really have 
a tent in that little suitcase? You’re 
not trying to get me to put you up 
here?” 

“It’s one of those monofilm 
ones.” He pulled the cup closer to 
him and it rattled in the saucer. “I 
told you my intentions in my letter. 
And you said okay. So here I am to 
court you.” Holman started to rise. 

Nancy nodded him down. “I 
supposed it will be all right. I don’t 
know.” She went back to the stove. 

Holman stood and started toward 
Nancy. He was distracted by a 
clicking sound in the hallway out- 
side. As he turned to the entrance- 
way, a large tan lion came in, its 
black-tipped tail swishing slowly. 

Holman stopped as the lion 
crossed the kitchen between him 
and Nancy. “Don’t panic, Nancy,” 
he said in a calm voice. “If nobody 
moves, it’ll go away.” 

Nancy smiled. “Why should he 
go away? It’s only Shandy.” 

The lion nuzzled his head over 
the backs of Nancy’s knees and 
made a growling, purring sound. 
The tip of his tail flipped against 
the smooth white stove. 

Holman frowned at the lion and 
dropped back into his chair. 
“Shandy? The last time I saw him 
he was a St. Bernard dog.” 

Nancy rumpled the lion’s mane. 
“Well, you know how Shandy is. 
He doesn’t stay one thing for long. 
He saw a picture of a lion on a 



59 




sack of meal last week and off he 
went.” 

“When you’re through fondling 
him I’d like my coffee. And 
where’s the rum?” 

Gently pushing the leaning lion 
away from her legs, Nancy said, 
“I’ll get it, Ken.” She patted 
Shandy on the back. “Go outside 
and play, Shandy. That’s a nice 
boy.” 

Without looking at Holman, the 
lion left the kitchen. 

“That’s ridiculous,” Holman said, 
turning from the empty doorway. 

“Damn it, Ken. He’s my pet and 
I like him.” The rum bottle made 
a hard flat sound as she put it in 
front of Holman. “You might try 
to accept him. He’s a very nice 
pet.” 

Holman unscrewed the botde 
cap. “Love me, love my whatever 
the hell he is.” 

“For somebody who came by to 
court me you’re not being very 
pleasant.” She poured out two cups 
of coffee. 

Looking at the red bottle cap, 
Holman said, “Okay. I’m sorry.” 

“You know Shandy’s been with 
me since I was just ten or so. And 
since dad died, Shandy’s been a 
real help.” 

“You don’t have to live out 
here.” Holman poured some rum 
into his coffee. “Just because your 
father was a naturalist and all.” 

“We don’t have to talk about my 
father. I like living here. We’ve al- 
ways lived here. Since we came out 
to Enoch.” 

“All right.” He paused to look 
across the table at her. “You want 
to keep arguing or will you let me 

60 



propose now?” 

Nancy shook her head. “Don’t 
now, Ken. Later sometime.” 

“You do know, though, that I 
want you. And you know I want 
you with me at the settlement.” 
Nancy folded her hands on the 
white tablecloth. “Oh, yes.” 

Holman drank the hot coffee 
fast. “And, really, Nancy, I don’t 
see how we could keep something 
like Shandy in the settlement.” 
“Come and have dinner with me 
tonight and we’ll talk then.” 
Putting down his empty cup, 
Holman said, “I’ll go set up my 
tent at a safe distance.” 

Outside it was nearly night. A 
few yards from the ship, the lion 
was rolling on his back in a patch 
of yellow flowers and growling to 
himself. 

Holman kept his back to the lion 
while he assembled his tent. And 
when he had it finished he went in- 
side and didn’t come out until 
Nancy called him for dinner. 

The sky, up through the yellow- 
green leaves, was clear. The after- 
noon was warm, with a slight feel 
of coming rain. Holman locked his 
hands behind his head and half- 
closed his eyes. “And living alone 
by the woods is dangerous,” he said. 

Nancy laughed. “You’ve just 
eaten lunch in it.” 

Holman closed his eyes. “And 
how do you know what Shandy is? 
Maybe he’s why this place got a 
bad name in the first place.” 

“He’s a harmless pet. I’m very 
fond of him.” 

“Didn’t your father have any 
ideas about him?” 



RON GOULART 




“Dad couldn’t figure Shandy 
out. He made all kinds of tests. 
Shandy’s the only one of his kind 
we ever saw. But, see, dad wasn’t 
sure what he was originally. He’s 
a mimic, an over-done chameleon. 
I don’t know. I like him.” 

Sitting up, Holman said, “Okay.” 
He touched Nancy’s shoulder. 
“Look, we’ve known each other, 
what? over a year now.” 

“Since you made that ridiculous 
field trip with your pupils and 
trampled all over everything.” She 
tucked her legs under her and 
leaned toward him. 

“Yeah. So let’s not argue or any- 
thing. But, really, Nancy, I would 
sort of like to marry you.” 

“I know.” 

“Have you any idea if you’re 
nearing a decision?” 

“Oh, yes.” 

“And?” 

“Well, I think we can." 
“Marry?” 

“Uh huh.” 

“Fine.” After he’d kissed Nancy, 
Holman became aware of a sham- 
bling off in the trees beyond their 
picnic spot. 

Twigs crackled and a medium- 
sized gorilla crashed into the open. 

Holman let go of Nancy and 
asked her, “Shandy?” 

The gorilla was carrying a large 
book in one paw. 

“Yes,” Nancy said, smiling. “He’s 
been nosing through the storeroom 
again. Must have been in one of 
my old picture books.” 

The gorilla came up near their 
picnic basket and held out the 
book. 

“He wants me to read to him, 
A.D. 2150: SHANDY 



Ken. He gets that way now and 
then.” Nancy took the book and 
opened it to the title page. “Earth 
fairy tales. This is one of your fa- 
vorites, huh, Shandy?” 

Bobbing his gorilla head, Shandy 
squatted down among the fallen 
leaves and smacked his paws to- 
gether. 

“Is he intelligent?” Ken asked 
incredulously. His scalp began to 
crawl. 

“Oh, no . Well, let’s start at 
the very beginning again,” Nancy 
said. 

Shandy rested his head on one 
clenched paw. 

“Once upon a time,” Nancy 
started. 

Holman stood and grabbed up 
his windbreaker. “I’ve heard this 
one before. I’ll drop by your place 
in the evening. Be finished by 
then?” 

Nancy half closed the book with 
her finger as a marker. “You’re 
angry?” 

His coat seam jammed and Hol- 
man decided to wear the coat open. 
“No.” He walked away into the 
woods. He was only a few steps 
into the trees when Nancy started 
the story again. 



T he fire flared up , 

brightening the ground around 
Holman’s tent. Nancy hugged her 
knees up close to her and rested 
her head on them. “He would be 
out of place at the settlement,” she 
said. 

Holman dropped a log on the 
campfire and came back to sit be- 
side the girl. “He’d probably be 



61 




happier running around out here 
in the woods.” 

Nancy nodded slowly. “Prob- 
ably.” 

The stairs out of the old ship 
rattled once off in the darkness. 
Holman looked away from the fire 
and toward the ship. 

Coming across the grass toward 
them was a giant teddy bear. 

Laughing, Nancy rose. “It’s 
Shandy.” She glanced at Holman. 
“Be nice to him.” 

Holman watched Shandy ap- 
proach and didn’t answer. 

The teddy bear sat down, like a 
dropped rag doll, next to Nancy. 
He rubbed his fuzzy brown paws 
over his black nose and blinked his 
button eyes at her. 

“Nice old Shandy,” said Nancy, 
pulling one of Shandy’s round ears. 
She smiled at Holman. “This is 
what he was being when dad and 
I first found him.” 

Holman, tilting forward, flipped 
a flat stone into the fire and scat- 
tered sparks. “That’s a coinci- 
dence.” 

“I was just, you know, about 
ten,” Nancy said, patting Shandy’s 
head. “What had happened was 
I’d been playing in the woods. And, 
anyway, I left my own teddy bear 
out there. Lost it. And I told dad, 
because it was almost night when 
I remembered. Well, he found it 
and right beside it there was big 
old Shandy. Dad and I both de- 
cided after looking at him for 
awhile that his name should be 
Shandy.” 

Shandy blinked his eyes and 
clapped his paws. 

Holman’s left heel jammed hard 



against the ground as he shot up. 
“God damn, Nancy, will you knock 
off all this maudlin, banal, boy and 
his dog stuff. We’re not taking that 
monster away anywhere.” 

“I know, I know, Ken. Don’t 
talk about it now.” She kept 
patdng the teddy bear gently. 
“Nice Shandy.” 

“And you, Shandy,” Holman 
shouted. “I’m doing the courting 
around here. Go hibernate or 
something, dammit.” 

Shandy’s eyes stopped blinking. 
Nancy’s hand slipped from his 
head and trailed down his woolly 
back as he rolled over and away. 
Without turning Shandy started off 
for the ship, slowly, on all fours. 

Finally Nancy looked at Holman. 
“That wasn’t nice, Ken.” 

Holman knew that. He could 
find nothing to say back to Nancy. 
He frowned and went into his tent, 
slamming the flap behind him. 

After closing the storeroom door, 
Holman carried the two old suit- 
cases down the bright corridor to 
Nancy’s kitchen. 

Nancy smiled at him and then 
at the brown, scuffed luggage. “Oh, 
sure, those will do,” she said. “I 
guess the movers will be able to 
take care of the heavy stuff.” 
Holman agreed and picked up 
his half -finished cup of coffee. 
“And we can leave lots of the stuff 
here. If we’re going to use this as 
sort of a summer place. I don’t 
think we’ll have to worry about 
vandals.” 

From the doorway Nancy said, 
“Not many girls bring a spaceship 
as a dowry.” 



62 



RON GOULART 




Holman took her shoulders and 
turned her back into the room. “We 
can make Shandy sort of a watch- 
dog.” 

“If he ever comes back.” 

“It’s only little more than a day 
he’s been gone.” 

“You were unkind to him.” 

“I know. I’m sorry.” 

Nancy edged around him and 
went to stand by the stove. “More 
coffee?” 

“Okay.” Holman was halfway to 
her when the knock sounded on the 
spaceship door. 

“Maybe it’s Shandy,” Nancy 
said, partly surprised, partly re- 
lieved. 

“Maybe. I’ll get it.” 

When Holman opened the door 
a tall, slender young man, wearing a 
conservative suit, stepped out of 
the darkness and into the light of 
the corridor. He had a neat black 
mustache and was carrying a big 
bunch of red and gold forest flow- 
ers. “Is Miss Nancy at home?” 
“Who are you?” The young man 
was standing close to him but Hol- 
man didn’t move back. 

The young man bowed slightly 
and smiled. “Tell Miss Nancy it’s 
Shandy. Or better, Mr. Shandy.” 
“Christ,” said Holman, backing 
now. 

Shandy bowed again politely and 
walked to the door of the kitchen, 
knocking on the wall before he en- 
tered. 

Holman jerked himself together 
when he heard Nancy gasp, and 
ran back to her. 

Shandy was sitting in a kitchen 
chair, his legs crossed. “It’s a rather 
interesting story, Miss Nancy,” he 

A.D. 2150: SHANDY 



said, smiling evenly. 

Nancy reached out and turned 
off the stove. “I imagine.” 

Shandy brushed each side of his 
mustache. “Well, to begin then. I 
was in the wood and suddenly I 
tripped, carelessly, over a fallen log 
and was knocked unconscious. 
When I recovered I found myself 
in this state.” He paused to rub 
his head. “And, of course, I re- 
membered.” 

Looking straight at him, Nancy 
said, “You’d had amnesia.” 

“Yes. You see, Miss Nancy, 
many years ago, I’m not sure how 
many, my people lived here and I 
was quite a prominent member of 
the ruling class. But I incurred, un- 
fortunately, the wrath of an evil 
scientist.” 

“And?” asked Holman. For 
somebody who’d recently been a 
teddy bear, Shandy looked pretty 
dapper. 

Shandy smiled. “She put a spell 
on me which caused me to change 
shape, and also made me forget 
what I had originally been.” 
Nancy laughed softly. “Well, it’s 
good to have you back.” 

With a faint flourish Shandy 
held out the wild flowers. “For you, 
Miss Nancy.” 

“Why, thank you, Shandy.” 
Holman leaned against the wall 
under the clock and eyed Shandy. 
“You back to stay?” 

“Well,” Shandy said. “I’ve 
known Miss Nancy quite a while. 
And am really quite fond of her. I 
hate to see her go.” He looked at 
the flowers Nancy held against her 
chest. “I have come to ask

FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 

BY R. M. MCKENNA

With more courage than prudence, the ensign followed his star 
to the final ( and delectably feminine ) test of a young officer’s 
honor ... A tender, ironic and funny story, by a new name

“Five past, sir.” 

“Very well.” 

Ensign Welnicki brought his 
slight form erect and strode across 
to the subspace voder, hardening 
his lips. Forestalling him, the light 
blinked on and the neutral ma- 
chine-voice said, “ . Carlyle. S.S. 
Rubberjack calling G.P.S. Carlyle .

The ensign pressed his trans- 
mitter bar and snapped, <e Carlyle 
here. Go ahead, Rubberjack 33 

Too bad there was no visual 
transmission in subspace, to carry 
his hawklike stare to that sloppy 
merchant officer. Too bad his crisp 
voice would be wasted in the neu- 
trality of Rubberjack 3 s voder. 

“This is Wendrew Fishdollar, 
President of the Republic of Fish- 
dollar Five,” the voder said. “Our 
forces now control S.S. Rubber- 
jack. We wish to negotiate a stand- 
ard treaty with the Galactic Pa- 
trol.” 

Welnicki’s long, thin nose 
twitched in dismay. “What . , . 
where is Fishdollar Five?” he 
gasped. Are they human? his 
thoughts ran. 

“Our present seat of government 
is in S.S. Rubberjack's tender,” 
the neutral voice replied. “We have 
seceded from the main body of set- 

66 



tiers. We wish to arrange for settle- 
ment on a different planet.” 

“Oh! Oh. Mutinous settlers?” 
Welnicki’s eyes narrowed. He 
smiled grimly. He glanced down 
at his blue and gold tunic and 
punched on the photo-recorder. 
Best have a record for the histo- 
rians. 

“Fishdollar, this is mutiny in 
subspace. In the name of the Ga- 
lactic Patrol, I command you to 
surrender yourself and your ac- 
complices to Captain Glover at 
once!” 

“I am chief of state of a sover- 
eign nation and I will not be spoken 
to like that,” the voder said. “If 
necessary, we will cast loose the 
tender and enter space to find our 
own planet. We are holding the 
tender crew at their stations, even 
as I speak.” 

“I forbid it absolutely!” the en- 
sign barked. “If you inspace at 
random, you will likely be far be- 
yond the sphere of permitted ex- 
ploration. You may betray human- 
ity to an unknown enemy. More- 
over, you will all be pirates and 
slavers. President Fishdollar, con- 
sider what you do!” 

“National survival is at stake. 
My first loyalty is to my nation.” 
Ensign Welnicki arched his neck. 
“I warn you, President Fishdollar,” 
he said vibrantly, “if you take those 
Rubberjack crewmen into space, I 
will follow and free them if I must 
pursue you to the uttermost ends of 
the galaxy!” 

“We will defend our sovereignty 
to our last drop of blood,” the 
voder replied pleasantly. “We had 
hoped for Patrol cooperation, but 

R. M. McKENNA 




we are prepared to carry on in the 
teeth of Patrol hostility. Our de- 
termination, Captain Kravitz, is 
unshakable. Goodbye, sir!” 

The light blinked off. That part- 
ing speech must have been sono- 
rous and magnificent in old Fish- 
dollar’s natural voice, the ensign 
thought. Then an echo of it nagged 
at him and he jumped. 

“Oh my,” he said, and punched 
the captain’s emergency signal. 

Captain Kravitz played back the 
photo-record and cocked a grizzled 
eyebrow at Welnicki. He sounded 
the general alarm and snapped 
orders: ready Scout Vessel Two 
and boarding party. Sleepy men 
manned battle stations. Captain 
Glover came on the voder to re- 
port his tender gone and trouble 
with lost-mass aberration. He was 
almost inaudible at full gain. “Pre- 
pare to regress,” Captain Kravitz 
ordered. 

“Proceed to destination and wait 
in orbit for me,” he shouted into 
the voder. “I will regress and send 
a party after your tender. Give me 
the break coordinates.” 

Whispered data passed until 
Kravitz said abruptly, “That’s 
enough, captain. I want a short 
regress. Good luck.” 

Welnicki thought about regres- 
sion. The nine canonical threes 
vary independently in subspace; 
when a ship inspaces between the 
initial and terminal points set up in 
her computer, she may be any- 
where. To find the Fishdollars, 
Carlyle would have to regress to 
the tender’s breakaway point with- 
out changing computer settings. It 

A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



is a mode of living backwards, and 
indescribably unpleasant. 

“Stand by to regress!” 

Howls of dismay arose. Ensign 
Welnicki stood at attention and 
raised his chin. 



P ALE WITH nausea, Ensign 
Welnicki faced Captain Kravitz 
after Carlyle inspaced. The tall, 
graying captain looked shaken also, 
but his eyes burned. His voice was 
ironically gentle. 

“Given the chance, I might have 
persuaded Fishdollar to take an- 
other Carina planet, avoided all 
this . four thousand parsecs be- 
yond the frontier of exploration 
. dangerous security breach . 
you command the search party, 
Ensign Welnicki . field-search 
each system in turn, buoy each as 
you leave ... I know I can count 
on you for the last full measure of 
devotion, Ensign Welnicki. .” 
Welnicki opened his eyes wide. 
“I shall not fail you, sir,” he said 
as firmly as he could. 

The captain stroked his clipped 
gray mustache with two fingers. “I 
expect you to pursue the Fishdol- 
lars to the uttermost ends of the 
galaxy, Ensign Welnicki,” he said 
solemnly. 

G.P.S. Carlyle had ghosted back 
into subspace. Welnicki in blue and 
gold faced his subordinates across 
a green table in the tiny wardroom 
of Scout Vessel Two. They wore 
gray coveralls. Sergeant Chong, 
dark, stocky, impassive. Chief 
Quartermaster Rutledge, plump, 
florid, voluble. Chief Drive Tech 



67 




Kihara, small, dark, reserved. The 
ensign cleared his throat. 

“This is a council of war, gentle- 
men. Here is our situation. .” 

Five Sol-type stars lay within 
the tender’s range. They would 
visit and field-search each system 
in turn, regain control of the tender 
and its crew when found, then wait 
for Carlyle. Under the treaty they 
were agents of the settlers’ parent 
system, Sigma-3 Velorum, and 
bound by its constitution. 

“So, gentlemen, it is really inter- 
systemic war. Now the enemy pop- 
ulation is about fifty — Captain 
Glover’s estimate, he hadn’t time 
to muster the settlers before we re- 
gressed. We have twenty marines 
and nine spacers. We are outnum- 
bered and must attack prepared 
positions, but courage and imagina- 
tion — ” 

“Won’t some setders be women?” 
Chong broke in gruffly. “We may 
not be so overmatched. How are 
they armed?” 

“Body weapons only, sergeant. 
Nothing heavy. We mustn’t hurt 
women, of course.” 

Chong coughed and subsided. 

“One thing more. Our inspace 
separation from Carlyle is great 
enough so that, under article four- 
teen of Patrol Regulations, our 
scout is an independent ship. I now 
declare this ship in full commis- 
sion.” 

He took glasses and a bottle of 
Earth whisky from a bag at his 
feet and poured drinks all around. 

“Stand, gentlemen,” he bade 
them. “To our ship and her chris- 
tening: gentlemen, I give you G.P. 
S. Fish dollar's Bane 

68 



The men choked a little on the 
fiery liquor. Ensign Welnicki wiped 
moisture from his eyds and looked 
on them with kindly gravity. 

“Hereafter you may address me 
as 'Captain Welnicki,’ ” he said. 
“And now stand by to outspace.” 

Arrowing through the fourth 
system like a hundred-foot rapier 
probing enemy vitals, G.P.S. Fish- 
dollar's Bane finally sniffed out the 
tender’s ID pattern on an inner 
planet. 

“Pinpoint the enemy and orbit 
his horizon. Compute physical data 
and report,” Captain Welnicki 
ordered Rutledge. 

Next ship-day he briefed his 
subordinates. A single continent 
lay athwart the planet’s equator, 
with major volcanic activity in its 
galactic north. The enemy base was 
on the southwest coast. Gravity 
was point nine, the day twenty-six 
standard hours, and the season 
spring in the southern hemisphere. 
They would achieve surprise by 
landing in the north and staging 
the landing party south in the at- 
mospheric flyer. What did they 
think? 

“It’s a laugh, the way we outgun 
them Fishdollars, Mr. — I mean 
Captain Welnicki,” Chong growled. 
“Why not take — this ship — right 
over ’em and call on ’em to sur- 
render?” 

“They’d defy us, sergeant. 
They’re ready to die to the last 
man — oh, you should have heard 
old Wendrew Fishdollar’s parting 
speech! And remember, they have 
hostages.” 

“Oughta be some way we could 
R. M. McKENNA 




use the ship’s armament.” 

“You’re a tough fighter, sergeant, 
but you lack creative imagination. 
No, my decision stands. Have your 
marines roll field packs.” 

Spiralling in, Captain Welnicki 
thought the continent spectacular. 
Volcanoes and fissure flows welled 
forth seas of molten rock. Seas of 
rain slashed into them and roared 
skyward again as atmospheres of 
steam. The shrewdest enemy would 
never expect attack from this 
quarter. 

G.P.S. F i s h d o liar’s Bane 
grounded at dusk in a wooded re- 
gion of low hills. The air was 
sulfurous but good, the sky a smok- 
ing glory. Occasionally the ground 
trembled. Singing birds in the strap- 
leaf foliage and furry ground rats 
were curious and unafraid. Cap- 
tain Welnicki walked apart and 
listened to the shouts of his marines 
getting groundworthy. 

Kihara and the spacers were as- 
sembling the flyer. The marines 
were playing grabtail, except two 
armed sentries. Keen fighting men 
all, spoiling for a fight or a foot- 
race. The captain winced when he 
heard one refer to his ship as 
G.P.S. Fishbait. But then, enlisted 
men were that way, hiding their 
nobler sentiments under such rough 
endearments. Underneath, how- 
ever, hearts of oak. 

Early in the flaming dawn 
Kihara flew the marines south. He 
returned in midaftemoon from the 
four-thousand-mile round trip. 
Then Captain Welnicki and the 
spacers flew south with equipment 
to complete the camp. There 

A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



seemed to be no large animal life, 
so he left the ship closed but un- 
guarded. 

Chong’s position lay behind a 
hill fifty miles north of the enemy. 
Great strap-leaf trees concealed 
tents and sentries. The captain, 
wearing the gray working uniform 
for the first time, called a council 
of war in his command tent. 

Eve of battle, gentlemen. Stout 
hearts, now. Chong, Crespi and 
Swenson would be landed in dark- 
ness to scout for the attack. They 
would plant a guide beacon and 
hide until the full party joined 
them the next night. Tomorrow 
the flyer would move reserve ra- 
tions and the heavy blaster ammo 
down from the ship. 

Sgt. Chong, in accordance with 
Patrol Regulations, would direct 
the actual fighting. He, Captain 
Welnicki, would resume command 
when the diplomatic phase opened, 
that is, when President Fishdollar 
offered to surrender. Questions? 

No questions. When Kihara re- 
turned from dropping Chong, he 
came again to the dark command 
tent and brushed past the orderly. 

“Captain, wake up. The ship’s 
guide beam don’t register on the 
flyer’s screen. Noticed it coming 
back just now. Something’s wrong.” 

“Do you suppose the Fishdollars 
— ” Captain Welnicki came full 
awake. Never betray doubt to a 
subordinate . the lonely 
leader. 

“Locate it visually tomorrow, 
then,” he said calmly. “Take Rut- 
ledge to help. But you can’t miss 
that big T-shaped lake.” 

“Oh, I guess we’ll find it, if — ” 



69 




“Of course you will. Turn in 
now, Kihara. Get some rest.” 

The captain did not sleep. He 
paced uneasily next day until the 
flyer returned, then almost forgot 
himself and ran to meet it. 

“Gone forever,” Rutledge said 
excitedly. “One of them fissure 
flows, must’ve been . miles of 
boiling rock right where we was 
. updrafts like to tore us apart 
and fried us too . now what, 
captain?” 

Captain Welnicki stood very 
erect and lifted his chin. 



ARKNESS UNDER the two 
small moons. Captain Wel- 
nicki stood apart and thought. 
Nothing but hand weapons and 
pack rations for two days. A fanatic 
enemy sitting with enormous re- 
serves in a prepared position. So 
. attack, of course . always 
the audacity . out of this nettle 
danger I pluck this flower . 

Kihara landed the party, minus 
the useless blasters, by Chong’s 
beacon. Chong, sulfurous in disgust, 
drew his corporals aside to im- 
provise a new plan. Captain Wel- 
nicki hovered near, saying nothing. 
He heard Chong tell Swenson to 
use the spacers for support fire. 

“Soon’s it’s light enough I’ll pass 
the word,” Chong finished. “Scat- 
ter now.” 

“Come on, you spacers,” Corpo- 
ral Swenson growled. 

He moved off, followed by the 
spacers. After a moment Captain 
Welnicki trailed along. 

The enemy base lay on high 
ground across a small stream. One 

70 



large unfinished building of slagged 
earth stood near the tender. The 
land was uneven and wooded. The 
roar of the sea came faintly through 
night air as Swenson briefed his 
spacers. 

“Sleep if you can,” he ended. 
“I’ll watch.” 

“I want to scout in closer, cor- 
poral,” the captain said. 

“Not past the stream, if you 
please, captain. We spotted infra- 
pickups over there. That’s why 
Chong wants daylight and cover 
fire.” 

Minutes after he crossed the 
stream the captain’s throat com- 
municator prickled. It was Chong. 

“Swenson tells me you’re prowl- 
ing, captain. Don’t tell me where 
you are cause I’m scared to know. 
But freeze there. That’s a military 
order in the field.” 

“Aye aye, sergeant,” the captain 
said glumly. 

He slept fitfully on the hard 
ground. Long time until dawn like 
thunder . Corporal Swenson 
stunned, command of the spacers 
devolving upon Captain Welnicki 
. ask no quarter, give none . 
red dawn streaks now, an omen 
. LISTEN: footsteps in the 
brush! 

Over his flame pistol Captain 
Welnicki saw a tall man appear. 
He wore a merchant spacer’s 
leather jumper and carried a small 
shovel. At the captain’s terse com- 
mand he dropped the shovel and 
faced the leveled pistol, hands at 
shoulder height. 

“Quiet now! Who are you?” 
Welnicki whispered. 

Eyes squinted above the loose 

R. M. McKENNA 





mouth. “I’m Jonas Cobb, that was 
third officer in Rubberjack. Are 
you a Patroler?” 

“Captain Stephen Welnicki, 
commanding G.P.S. Fishdollar 3 s 
Bane. I have come to liberate you.” 
“Well now, cap’n, that’s right 
good of you. I’d be pleased to 
help.” The hands dropped. 

“You can, Cobb. I can use help. 
I’ve lost my ship, you see. I have 
only twenty-eight men with noth- 
ing but body weapons and two 
days’ rations. I must win on my 
first assault.” 

“Here’s an idea, cap’n. Them 
Fishdollars are still sleeping aboard. 
Suppose I sneak back, close the 
bunkroom collision doors and pull 
the fuses? I’ll jam the hull doors 
too, so the guards can’t close ’em.” 
“Good man, Cobb! Would you 
dare try?” 

“I would, cap’n. Suppose they 
closed up the tender on you? All 
the chow’s still aboard, and you 
can’t eat native protein here with- 
out it’s bio-fielded. Them Fish- 
dollars could just sit and guzzle 
while you poor Patrolers all 
starved, and then who’d liberate 
us? Handguns won’t noways touch 
that plating.” 

Chong came on the communica- 
tor. “Military order, captain. Stay 
put and keep your head down. We 
attack in one minute.” 

“No! Oh no, sergeant,” the cap- 
tain protested. “I’ve taken a Rub- 
berjack prisoner . he’ll jam the 
hull doors for us — ” 

“Don’t trust him nor you neither. 
The both of you stay put. Here 
goes — ” 

“No, Sergeant Chong! I relieve 
A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



you of command. Article thirty- 
seven, Patrol Regulations. Stand 
fast, now!” 

He smiled apologetically. “My 
field commander is impatient. But 
hurry, Cobb. My marines are strain- 
ing at the leash.” 

Cobb moved off hastily. Mo- 
ments later came a subdued clamor 
of voices, scurrying feet, grating 
noises. Captain Welnicki peeped 
through the screening shrubbery 
just in time to see the ramp pull 
in and the ponderous cargo doors 
swing shut. 

He called Chong: “Enemy 

alerted . fortunes of war . 
stiff upper lip . resume com- 
mand, Sgt. Chong.” 

Chong exploded. Situation mil- 
itarily hopeless . stop playacting 
and surrender . your baby, cap- 
tain, and look to its napkin. 

Captain Welnicki stood stiffly 
erect and raised his chin. 



T hat darkest hour . 

inexorable hunger on this star- 
lost planet . guile now . keen 
intelligence of the spaceways. 
Captain Welnicki called his sub- 
ordinates to a council of war. 

They had one idea — to sur- 
render. “Somebody, you, captain, 
go bang on that personnel port,” 
Rutledge urged. 

“Never! Death before dishonor!” 
“Hey! They’re sending out a 
flag,” Chong said. 

The tender’s personnel valves 
were ajar and between them a 
white cloth dangled. 

“I’ll go in and parley,” Captain 
Welnicki said crisply. “Deploy and 

71 




cover me, sergeant. If they try to 
overpower me, blast us all down.” 

Sgt. Chong snorted nervously. 
The captain walked toward the 
ship . lonely, gallant . ashes of 
defeat . guile now. The ramp 
poked out and a lanky figure, bear- 
ing the flag, descended. It was 
Cobb. 

“Cobb! What happened? Did 
they—” 

“General Cobb to you, cap’n. 
General of the Army of Fishdollar 
Five. I come out to take your sur- 
render.” 

The captain stared. 

“President Fishdollar says tell 
you we’ll treat you real good if the 
marines’ll help with the settlement. 
If so be you’ve a mind to, the 
foreign minister will work out a 
Patrol treaty.” 

The hangdog features gloated in 
mean triumph. Degrading . 
proud wings drooping . unless 
. yes . restructure the ge- 
stalit. 

“I come not in war but in peace, 
general. Commanding a Patrol 
vessel empowers me to act as Pa- 
trol ambassador. My men will aid 
you, in accordance with standard 
Patrol policy. Tell President Fish- 
dollar I will make my official entry 
shortly after noon.” 

“I’ll do that, cap’n. Say, you’re 
a slippery one too, ain’t you?” the 
general asked admiringly. 

He turned away. Ambassador 
Welnicki rejoined his aides in state- 
ly dignity. Rutledge was secretary, 
Kihara chauffeur and Chong com- 
mander of the honor guard, he 
told them. Then he ordered a re- 
treat to the flyer. 



In the flyer he donned his blue 
and gold uniform. He had meant 
to wear it when he took President 
Fishdollar’s surrender. Oh well, 
he had not disgraced that ancient, 
mystic bird-and-anchor symbol . 
diplomatic triumphs, now. 

Kihara landed the flyer before 
the large single building. No one 
was about. Eight marines got out 
and lined up. Ambassador Welnicki 
watched while a pretty young wom- 
an came out of the building and 
looked doubtfully at the flyer. 

She was small, dark haired and 
wore a high-girded chlamys of 
clinging white cloth. Squinting, he 
saw above her left breast an em- 
blem worked in red. It was an out- 
lined fish with the ancient, mystic 
dollar symbol inscribed. She ap- 
proached the marines hesitantly. 

“Here now, young woman, those 
men are on duty,” the ambassador 
warned. “You mustn’t molest them. 
Please inform the foreign min- 
ister — ” 

She smiled. “I am the foreign 
minister,” she said, bobbing a curt- 
sy. “Lindrew Fishdollar, at your 
service, Mr. Ambassador, and wel- 
come to Fishdollar Five. The presi- 
dent is waiting in the state recep- 
tion hall.” 

“Thank you, Madame Minister.” 
He stepped down with dignity, 
saluting, and followed her into the 
building. She danced ahead with 
vivacity unbecoming a foreign 
minister. 

The hall was large, with bare 
slag walls and rough wooden 
furniture. Coming to meet him 
was another pretty young woman 



72 



R. M. McKENNA 




in another white chlamys that 
molded itself to her walking. He 
stopped short. 

She was smiling . milk white 
skin and jet black hair . thick 
eyebrows, black eyes . small, 
sweetly curvesome . holding out 
a hand. 

“Oh my God!” he said shakily 
“You! You are Wendrew Fish- 
dollar!” 

“Wendy to my friends, Captain 
Wennocky, and I hope you will be 
one. We do so want a Patrol treaty. 
Won’t you sit down?” 

The ambassador sat down, head 
whirling. 

“How many of your officers of 
state are women, may I ask, Ma- 
dame President?” 

“All of us,” she said brightly. 
“Our charter population, fifty- 
two in all, is entirely feminine. 
Since our founding vye have nat- 
uralized eleven men.” 

“Well, Madame President . 
you must realize . most unusu- 
al. .” 

“I understand, Captain Wen- 
nocky. Perhaps you’re tired. Quar- 
ters are ready for you upstairs and 
the minister of the interior will 
show you to them if you wish. 
General Cobb will berth your men 
in the tender.” 

“My name is Welnicki,” the am- 
bassador said, rising. “Captain 
Stephen Wel-nicki.” 

“Oh, forgive me, Captain Wel- 
nicki. General Cobb — but there, 
poor man, you’re tired and I won’t 
keep you. Will you and your aides 
attend an informal dinner tonight 
with my cabinet officers?” 

“Yes . delighted . .” 

A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



The minister of the interior 
skipped along apologizing prettily 
for the crude furniture. She was 
Wandrew Fishdollar, call her Wan- 
da, and she would see him again 
at dinner. His bedroom was also 
the Fishdollar National Library. 

The ambassador called a council 
of state. His aides were equally 
overcome. Who’da thought it? . 
all women, all named Fishdollar 
. cute as crystals, too . always 
liked them Sigma Velorum planets 
. hey, Chong, you old goat? . 

Dinner . elfin faces with white 
skin and black eyes . short, kilted 
skirts, sleeveless blouses . Cin- 
drew, Rondrew, Sandrew, Dun- 
drew . minister of this, minister 
of that . the ambassador was 
still dazed. 

His aides did well. Kihara talked 
slaggers and nuclear furnaces to 
the minister of public works — Cin- 
dy, was she? Rutledge, expansive, 
held a group bright eyed and 
breathless with his account of the 
volcanic north. Chong was saying, 
“No offense, General Cobb, but in 
a fight the marines. .” Defense 
Minister Bondrew listened admir- 
ingly. 

The ambassador felt better. Born 
diplomats, these men. That came of 
roaming the starways ... a cos- 
moplanetary polish . charm no 
provincial could resist — “What did 
you say, Madame President? My 
mind wandered.” 

“Let’s take our teacups into the 
next room where it’s quiet. I want 
to tell you the story of the Fish- 
dollars.” 

“Of course.” The ambassador 

73 




rose with courtly, cosmoplanetary 
grace. 

She sat beside him on the single 
cloth draped bench, and smoothed 
her short red skirt. 

“In the second century After 
Space, Stephen — may I call you 
Stephen?” she began. He nodded 
indulgently. 

The eighty-fourth planet colo- 
nized from Earth, she told him, was 
Fishdollar One, so named for An- 
drew Fishdollar, who founded the 
settlement and brought along many 
kinsmen. The settlement prospered 
but the planet had a strong Rho 
effect. Did he understand? 

“Yes, Madame President. An ex- 
cess of female over male births 
until a certain population density 
is reached.” 

“It may take centuries. It’s ter- 
rible. Stevie, I 5 ve actually heard 
the Patrol sometimes sends 
ships . .” She blushed prettily and 
looked down at the teacup on her 
rounded knee. 

“Yes. Yes, Wendrew. There is 
a special clause — oh, most delicate- 
ly worded — in the standard Patrol 
treaty with Rho effect planets. 
Spacers call them good liberty 
planets.” He felt warm, tugged at 
his tight collar and kept his gaze 
on the president’s teacup. 

She took up her story. Genetic 
strains varied in susceptibility to 
the Rho effect, of course he knew, 
and it was terribly severe on Fish- 
dollars. The clan became immense- 
ly wealthy through pioneer land 
holdings, but the name was dying 
out. Male Fishdollars were re- 
cruited from Earth and the other 
planets until the name was extinct 



elsewhere, but it was no use. Sex 
control was no good — bad psychic 
effects in the resultant males. Final- 
ly, in the fourth century, the Fish- 
dollars settled a new planet, seek- 
ing a reduced Rho effect. 

“But Wendy, why not adopt 
boys, change names and so on?” 

“Against the laws, Stevie. People 
with low-Rho names believed the 
effect worked through the name 
and not the gene pattern. Silly su- 
perstition of course, but they had 
the votes.” 

It was the same story on Planets 
Fishdollar Two and Three. Fish- 
dollar wealth grew and Fishdollar 
males dwindled in inverse ratio. On 
Fishdollar Four, in the Sigma-3 
Velorum system, they vanished al- 
together. A few hundred women 
still bore the name. 

“It’s pitiful, Stevie, when a name 
dies after thousands of years,” she 
said softly. She put down her tea- 
cup and smoothed nervously at her 
brief skirt. 

“I can imagine. Ten generations 
of Welnickis have served the Pa- 
trol.” 

“We tried hard to keep the name 
alive,” she went on, vainly tug- 
ging the pleated skirt lower on the 
smooth white legs. “Stevie, some of 
us here are haploid and some are 
illegitimate.” 

Her head drooped. Wordless, he 
watched her hands. She raised a 
rosy face to him impulsively. 

“You mustn’t think I’m one,” 
she said rapidly. “My father was 
the last Andrew Fishdollar, the 
last man. He died two years ago.” 

The younger Fishdollars, she con- 
tinued, planned one last effort to 



74 



R. M. MaKENNA 




settle a new planet, to be named 
Fishdollar Five. They recruited a 
group meeting Patrol standards 
and got sponsorship. It cost them 
a great deal of money. Their 
constitution and legal codes were 
those of the parent system, with 
minor changes correcting the un- 
fair laws against high-Rho names. 

“And then — oh Stevie, those 
superstitious, ungrateful, low-Rho 
settlers! While we were still in sub- 
space they began amending the 
laws and the constitution. They 
even changed our planet’s name to 
Rewbobbin, the ugliest, lowest-Rho 
name among them!” 

“Rewbobbin!” He shuddered. 
“We were just frantic, Stevie. 
We wanted to scratch their eyes 
out and we wanted to die. Then 
we thought about seceding. We 
learned that Rubber jack 3 s tender 
was preloaded to care for an ad- 
vance party of two hundred. We 
talked to General Cobb — you know 
the rest.” 

“Yes, Wendy. How imaginative 
... a random inspacing into un- 
explored vastness . Wendy, I 
salute your courage!” 

“We weren’t really so brave. The 
tender was a last resort, to force 
Captain Kravitz to settle us on 
another Carina planet. But when 
he reacted so violently — oh, Stevie, 
you should have heard the lan- 
guage he used to me — we knew we 
must go. We really had no choice, 
now did we?” 

The ambassador coughed and 
licked his lips. “No, I suppose not, 
Wendy. Captain Kravitz is un- 
imaginative. aging. .” 
“Stevie, did we do wrong? Do 

A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



you think we did?” 

“No, Wendy. Not you, who- 
ever else may have. You were mag- 
nificent. I will use all my influence 
to see that your setdement lives.” 
“I’m so happy, Stevie. I feel safe 
now. Tomorrow Linda can work 
out a treaty with you. Shall we 
join the others?” 

The smooth white legs stood up. 

The ambassador could not sleep. 
His own copy of Patrol Regulations 
was lost, but providentially he 
found a copy in the Fishdollar 
National Library beside his bed. 
He thumbed it. 

He was, indeed, still captain 
and therefore ambassador while his 
crew was intact. But that other 
article . here it was: 

“In exceptional circumstances 
involving galactic security the com- 
mander of a ship or squadron may 
assume plenipotentiary status and 
execute finally rather than provi- 
sionally binding agreements ... as 
soon thereafter as practicable he 
shall report to Prime Reference 
for plenary court martial.” 

So. If he dared. He remem- 
bered old Borthwick’s lectures in 
Patrol Jurisprudence at the aca- 
demy. Only two men, both squad- 
ron commanders, had ever used 
that article. One had been shot, 
one cashiered. The ambassador 
slept. 

Over coffee next morning the 
foreign minister produced copies 
of the Patrol treaty with Sigma-3 
Velorum, with appropriate name 
changes, and proposed thev sign 
-them. 



75 




“These won’t do, Madame Min- 
ister,” he protested. 

“Why not, Stephen? We have al- 
most the same constitution.” 
“Your planet, Lindrew. Almost 
four thousand parsecs beyond the 
sphere of settlement. Do you know 
why we have a frontier?” 

“Oh, Patrol policy ... no, why?” 
“Other intelligent beings may be 
settling the galaxy just like we are. 
We’re afraid to meet them too 
soon.” 

“Why?” 

“Maybe hostile. Lindrew, just 
because the Patrol prevents inter- 
planetary wars, it’s the only deep 
space fighting force humanity has. 
But with no wars, and support of 
the Patrol voluntary, it isn’t very 
big. Not big enough for galactic 
war.” 

“Will it ever be?” 

“We hope so. We add a new 
ship for each new planet. We in- 
crease as the cube of the radius 
and our frontier only as the square, 
as long as we enforce the sphere 
of settlement concept.” 

“The Patrol enforces it?” 

“Yes, by denying sponsorship 
and protection to non-treaty settle- 
ments. We can’t actually use force 
against a sovereign planet, except 
blockade under certain conditions.” 
“Do settlements ever defy you?” 
“Not for long. They give up and 
we move them to a settled planet 
that wants them, wiping out all 
traces of their stay.” 

“Oh. Stephen, do you approve 
of that policy?” 

“No, Lindrew, I never have. It’s 
— it’s unimaginative. But they’ll 
tear their beards at Prime Refer- 



ence about your planet.” 

“But you’ll help us, won’t you 
Stephen? How must we change the 
standard treaty?” 

“This is an outpost planet and the 
aliens, if they exist, will surely find 
it first. We’ll need a Class I base. 
You must in time support extra- 
planetary defenses.” 

“You make the changes, Ste- 
phen. Whatever you say. Then we’ll 
sign.” 

He shuffled his feet. “I’m afraid 
I can only initial it, Madame Min- 
ister. Prime Reference must ratify. 
I will urge most strongly — ” 

“Oh Stephen,” she interrupted, 
pretty face stricken, “might we lose 
our treaty after all?” 

“There’s a chance, I can’t deny 
it.” 

“Oh dear! I haven’t the heart to 
tell Wendy.” 

“I need to think,” the ambas- 
sador said. He excused himself un- 
happily. 



D AYS PASSED and the settle- 
ment grew. The ambassador 
put away his blue and gold and 
worked with his hands. The native 
strap-leaf vegetation flowered riot- 
ously through long, warm days, and 
so did Earth plants in the test plots. 
The shapely Fishdollars became 
golden-tan and more charming 
than ever. 

The Patrolers worked like fiends 
erecting buildings and plants, striv- 
ing to outdo the merchant spacers. 
The girls helped where they could 
and bubbled admiringly at the 
prodigies of labor. The minister of 
public works told Chong privately 

R. M. McKENNA 



76 




that one marine equalled two mer- 
chant spacers. The latter, as if un- 
ware of their lesser worth, worked 
like fiends too. 

Kihara and his two petty officers 
were the engineers. Corporal Cres- 
pi, with a gang of marines and 
Fishdollars, milled fragrant lum- 
ber from native hardwoods. Houses 
went up and were filled with furni- 
ture rough-styled by General Cobb. 
The ambassador worked on the 
power plant, the materials con- 
verter, and then the air condition- 
ing. The men became hard, deeply 
bronzed, strongly alive as the native 
trees. 

With his aides, the ambassador 
worked out treaty revisions. 

“PR will never ratify,” Rutledge 
said. 

“Look. Maybe the aliens don’t 
exist,” the ambassador argued. “If 
they do exist, they may respect 
boundaries. Then Fishdollar Five 
stakes a huge claim for humanity. 
If it’s war, we make our fight 
around an outpost planet, far from 
settled regions.” 

“We ain’t Prime Reference,” 
Chong growled. “Who you trying 
to convince?” 

Fishdollar Five ratified the 
treaty. Ambassador Welnicki looked 
unhappily at his initials and told 
the foreign minister, “I’m sorry, 
Linda.” 

“We understand, Stephen. We 
know you’re doing all you dare for 
us.” 

Resting one day from pipefitting, 
the ambassador asked Kihara, 
“You know math, chief. Isn’t it 



true this damned, sacred ‘sphere of 
settlement’ really takes in the whole 
galaxy in subspace?” 

“Yes, in a way.” 

“It’s fossilized, Einsteinian 
thinking. Damn the admirals!” 

“The admirals think Einstein is 
God. You better think the admirals 
are God,” Kihara warned. 

The ambassador thought. The 
outpost planet . last, loneliest, 
loveliest, exquisite, apart . one 
man with imagination . serve 
humanity and be damned for it 
now, canonized later . 

One afternoon he walked with 
Wendy to their favorite spot on a 
headland above the sea. She 
climbed before him up the steep, 
narrow way, and the sea wind flut- 
tered her skirt. The outpost planet 
. democracy . daughter planets 
teeming with pretty girls like 
Wendy and stalwart young men 
like . really imaginative galactic 
ecology. 

Sunset neared and half the sky, 
as usual, flamed gorgeously. The 
sea sent back the color and beat 
hypnotically against the cliff base. 
Wendy stood on tiptoe, arms raised, 
skirt wind-molded, sweetly rounded 
form outlined against the sky. 

“Stevie, Stevie,” she whispered, 
“isn’t our planet beautiful? I would 
rather die than leave it. I feel . 
fulfilled, somehow.” 

“Wendy, I haven’t told you, but 

99 

She came to him in quick con- 
cern, her hand on his arm. Then it 
came out of him in a rush. 

“Regulations permit me to as- 
sume plenipotentiary status. If I 



A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



77 




do and then sign that treaty, it will 
bind the Patrol absolutely. Wendy, 
I’m going to do it!” 

“Can you really, Stephen? Won’t 
they find a way . Her face was 
grave. 

“I can, for sure. I’ll undergo 
court martial after. But the treaty 
will stand. The pledged word of the 
Galactic Patrol is sacred. Only the 
Patrol binds humanity into any 
kind of unity, and its very existence 
depends upon planetary trust in 
Patrol good faith.” 

“It’s so much power for one 
man.” 

“Not every man is made a Patrol 
captain. Believe me, Wendy, your 
planet will live. And I’m glad.” 
Then she was in his arms and 
they were kissing, and Captain- 
Ambassador Welnicki trod on air 
back to the settlement feeling that 
the game was worth the candle if 
they took his head for it. He signed 
with a flourish, Stephen Welnicki, 
Captain, GP, subscribed Ambas- 
sador Plenipotentiary. Then he 
called his aides into council and 
assumed the status formally, just 
for the record. 



D AYS PASSED, shorter and 
warmer, fruits forming on the 
native plants. Basic installations 
were complete. Exploring and 
mapping teams brought in mineral 
and biotic specimens for testing. It 
was midsummer of the four-hun- 
dred-two-day year. President Fish- 
dollar brought up a delicate sub- 
ject with the ambassador plenipo- 
tentiary. 

Four of her citizens were, well, 



you know, and they wanted to 
marry four of his marines. Could 
he authorize it? 

“Of course, Wendy. Enlisted 
men may marry on any treaty 
planet.” 

He spoke to Chong. 

“I told ’em hell no,” the sergeant 
said. “Us marines depend on high- 
er authority to protect us from that. 
You’re gonna back me up, ain’t 
you, captain?” 

“No I’m not! What’s so terrible 
about marriage?” 

“Ask Corporal Hodges that, cap- 
tain. He’s married and the Fish- 
dollars know it.” 

Chief Justice Sandrew married 
the four couples in a mass cere- 
mony. President Fishdollar wept 
and the ambassador plenipotentiary 
comforted her. 

She was distrait and melancholy 
in the days that followed, and the 
ambassador plenipotentiary was 
himself obscurely troubled. Eight 
more couples married. Then one 
evening they were again on the 
headland in a flaming sunset and 
she began crying softly. She didn’t 
know why, unless it was because 
the sunset was so beautiful. 

So he held her and they talked in 
low voices until, as the sun’s red 
disk touched the sea rim, he had to 
tell her that no Galactic Patrol of- 
ficer could marry until he reached 
the rank of commander. 

“But you’re a captain already, 
Stevie.” 

“Only in a special, temporary 
way — ” 

“But your heroism, finding us, 
losing your ship — surely they’ll 



78 



R. M. McKENNA 




make it permanent.” 

“Wendy, they’ll want my head 
for all that. I . I’ve tried to think 
that way myself, but I can’t. I do 
believe, in the far future the name 
Welnicki will be honored by what 
I have done, but now — when 
Captain Kravitz comes — I have no 
right—” 

“Every man has a right to hap- 
piness, Stevie. What if you married 
anyway?” 

“Cashiered, automatically. Ten 
generations of Welnickis have given 
their lives to the Patrol with not 
one dishonorable action — ” 

“Stevie, you make me furious! 
How can marriage be dishonor- 
able? We’ll keep it secret and you 
can command the base here until 
you make commander. It’s all so 
simple, really.” 

“I need to think,” he said sadly. 
She laid her dark head on his 
shoulder and cried. 

He thought: make her happy 
. secret . impassioned speech 
before the admirals . galaxy to 
fill . creative imagination con- 
firms me now, gentlemen, time will 
vindicate me ... so tearfully 
anxious ... in for a copper, in for 
a solar . make her happy . 

“Wendy,” he said in a low, halt- 
ing voice, “let’s do get married.” 

“Oh yes , Stevie! Yes, yes, yes!” 
She melted into his arms. 

The crimson sun dropped below 
the sea rim and the sky faded to 
somber red. They walked back 
hand in hand, the president chat- 
tering gaily, the ambassador pleni- 
potentiary oppressed under the 
cumulative enormity of his com- 
mand decisions. 

A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



The wedding was beautiful. The 
bride wore her chlamys of state and 
the groom stood very erect in blue 
and gold. Chief Justice Sandrew 
wept but managed to get the words 
out clearly enough through tears 
and sniffs. All the Fishdollars wept. 
Even hard, unsentimental Sgt. 
Chong snorted nervously. 

Married life was wonderful. 
The president melted with affec- 
tion and the ambassador pleni- 
potentiary loved it. Never had dip- 
lomatic relations between the Pa- 
trol and any planetary government 
been so cordial. 

Even the weather reflected it. 
The days, cold and rainy as winter 
came on, turned clear and warm 
again. The native trees were de- 
ciduous and their long strap-leaves 
became a blaze of color carrying 
the dawn glory through softly 
bright days, carpeting the ground 
with sunset. Thinking and worry 
were fantastically unnecessary. 

Then one beautiful morning after 
an intimate breakfast, the ambas- 
sador plenipotentiary learned that 
maybe, just maybe now, darling, he 
was going to be a father. A few 
tearful moments later an excited 
quartermaster called him to his 
door. G.P.S. Carlyle was in orbit 
and would ground next day. Cap- 
tain Kravitz instructed Ensign Wel- 
nicki to report aboard as soon as 
grounding was secured. 

All along her six-hundred-foot 
length, ground shores probed out 
to equalize tensions as G.P.S. 
Carlyle eased her lift. The shriek 
died with the slowing generators, 
and the starboard personnel port 

79 




swung open. Beyond the zone 
markers Ensign Welnicki looked 
into his wife’s face, then marched 
toward the ship. He wore his blue 
and gold. 

Carlyle's passageways seemed 
more cramped than he remem- 
bered. He felt foolish in his dress 
uniform, exchanging greetings with 
coverall-clad shipmates. He ducked 
past the saluting orderly into the 
captain’s office almost with relief. 

Captain Kravitz, behind his gray 
desk, had never looked more aus- 
terely forbidding. As the ensign 
made his report, the grizzled eye- 
brows raised, then two fingers 
stroked the gray mustache. When 
the ensign reported his binding 
signature of the treaty, the captain 
raised his hand. 

“Very well, Ensign Welnicki. Re- 
main in your room incommunicado 
until further notice.” 

Ensign Welnicki stood very 
erect and raised his chin. Then he 
walked directly to his stateroom in 
the bow, ignoring greetings from 
former shipmates. He clanged the 
door shut, and never before had the 
tiny room seemed so microscopic. 

A long week’s pacing, three steps 
each way. Thoughts . defense at 
Prime Reference . first the grave 
statement of facts, for the record 
and for unborn historians . for 
some future Welnicki burning to 
vindicate his triple-great grand- 
father . then the exhortation to 
courage and imagination, power- 
fully restrained emotion almost 
breaking through . deep, ringing 
sincerity . then the gray court- 
yard and the firing squad ... I 



die without resentment ... my 
short life justified, its me anin g 
found in action . 

Thoughts about his planet . 
his planet? . Wendy, the child 
. a boy, of course, the Welnickis 
were quite low-Rho . never to 
see his son . knowing that in the 
gray courtyard. He wanted to 
cry. 



E NSIGN SOTERO, armed and 
brassarded, came to conduct 
him to the captain on the eighth 
day. 

“Damn orders, Steve,” Sotero 
said, standing in the door. “We 
know most of the story and we’re 
all for you. Your wife and the 
skipper have been going round and 
round for days, beating each other 
over the head with that treaty, 
Patrol Regulations and the consti- 
tution of Sigma-3 Velorum. Some- 
body heard him say she’s the smart- 
est space lawyer this side of Earth. 
Don’t let him stampede you, 
Steve!” 

“Thanks, Juan, I won’t.” Ensign 
Welnicki’s own voice sounded 
strange to him after the silence. 

The captain was disconcertingly 
un-fierce. He looked tired and sad 
i behind the gray desk. 

“Sit down, Stephen,” he said 
dully. “Let’s talk about this mess 
we’re in.” 

Ensign Welnicki sat down gin- 
gerly, his back stiff. 

“My head falls too, of course,” 
the captain went on. “You’re too 
little a goat. They may even chop 
down Sector Admiral Carruthers.” 
He sighed and looked at the 



80 R. M. McKENNA 




overhead. The ensign opened his 
mouth. 

“I see my error now,” the 
captain forestalled him. “You are 
not mature enough for command. 
But I was ensign under your grand- 
father Welnicki in the old Ashbur- 
ton before you were bom. I 
thought I sensed in you the same 
intangible that made him great. 
Well, spilt milk, Stephen. What 
can we do?” 

Ensign Welnicki suggested un- 
steadily that the Fishdollars might 
consent to removal to an approved 
planet. 

“First offer I made, Stephen. 
They voted it down unanimously. 
Bluster was no good, pleading no 
good. With that treaty they’ve got 
us cold and they know it.” 

Ensign Welnicki wished he were 
dead but did not see how that 
would help. After a long silence the 
captain spoke again. 

“I have one last hope, Stephen. 
Something you’ve overlooked. I got 
it from Rutledge.” 

The ensign looked his question. 
“You didn’t formally assume 
plenipotentiary status until after 
you signed, so technically your sig- 
nature is not binding. Now if it 
was a forced subterfuge to counter 
logistic pressure, your ship being 
lost and all, we can repudiate the 
treaty without breaching faith. 
Only you can really know.” 

Ensign Welnicki breathed deep- 
ly. “The Fishdollars with no treaty, 
how they can survive, I don’t 
know, captain . .” 

“We’ll leave message capsules. 
When they call for help we’ll dump 
’em on Rewbobbin.” 



“I ... I don’t know, captain.” 

“We can fix everything else, save 
your career.” 

“No, sir. The treaty stands.” 

“You signed falsely and you 
know it.” 

“I can say — I hereby do say that 
I signed second copies afterward. 
The treaty stands, sir!” 

Ensign Welnicki stood up, sud- 
denly feeling good. 

Captain Kravitz stood up too, 
face tautly impersonal. 

“All right,” he said, shuffling 
papers on his desk. “I want to lift 
out as soon as possible.” He pulled 
out a paper and looked coldly at 
the ensign. 

“As you may or many not know, 
your marriage makes you a citizen 
of Fishdollar Five,” he went on. 
“As you may or may not know, 
your precious treaty forbids re- 
moval of a citizen to another planet 
without governmental consent. I 
doubt the admirals at Prime Ref- 
erence would choose to come all 
the way out here just to court- 
martial one small ensign. But as 
you certainly know, your marriage 
means the automatic revocation of 
your commission. You will save me 
trouble and delay by signing this 
resignation.” 

He shoved the paper across the 
desk. Ensign Welnicki looked at it 
stupidly. His inner song was muted. 

“Sgt. Chong will stay to com- 
mand the temporary base force,” 
the captain was saying. “Within a 
year you may expect a Patrol con- 
struction fleet to open your com- 
munications and start work on the 
base. Your pay accounts can be 
settled then. There! Sign it!” 



A.D. 2170: THE FISHDOLLAR AFFAIR 



81 




Ensign Welnicki bent and signed. 
The captain looked at the paper 
and handed it back. 

“Use your right name,” he said. 

Ensign Welnicki looked blank. 

“Stephen Fishdollar!” the cap- 
tain roared. 

The ensign looked blanker still. 

“Ensign Fishdollar, some day 
you really must read through the 
legal codes of your adopted planet,” 
the captain said mock-earnestly. 
“One of the changes made by the 
Fishdollars in the Sigma-3 Velor- 
um codes was to make marriage 
and descent ma trilineal. That way 
their name escapes Rho-death.” 

Ensign Fishdollar sagged. His 
inner song faded to a whisper. 

“Very, very clever of the Fish- 
dollars,” the captain said musingly. 
“To link their name with the X- 
chromosome rather than with the 
Y. So it becomes as low-Rho as it 
was high before. Very clever in- 
deed. 

“Ensign Fishdollar, you utter 
lamb, did you honestly not know 
that?” he finished with roar. 

Ensign Fishdollar swung his 
head dumbly. 

“You know, Ensign Fishdollar, 
that the Patrol regards as null any 
marriage with a citizen of a non- 
treaty planet,” the captain said 
softly. 

The savage self-biting of his 
autonomic nervous system almost 
made him grimace as he bent word- 
lessly to the paper and signed 
“Stephen Fishdollar.” The inner 
song was dead. 

“You may go home now, Mr. 
Fishdollar,” the captain said. “I 
will send your personal effects, less 

82 



uniforms, ashore before I lift out.” 

Mr. Fishdollar turned away. 
Captain Kravitz came around the 
desk and laid an arm across his 
shoulders. 

“Sit down again, Stephen,” he 
said soberly. “I had to play it out 
to the end, but I don’t want you 
leaving on that note, lad.” 

They sat down, on the same side 
of the desk. 

“Stephen,” the captain said 
gently, “all youngsters worth their 
salt chafe at the policy of restricted 
settlement and exploration. I did 
and I still do, but I never had the 
courage to act directly.” 

He paused and closed his eyes, 
then continued. 

“Graybeards in conclave never 
make the important decisions for 
our species. They are always 
afraid. The decisions well up from 
the four-dimensional life-con- 
tinuum that is our species, and the 
graybeards accept, with what 
grace they can muster.” He tilted 
back his head, eyes still closed. 

“The decisions always come 
through crooked, unmapped chan- 
nels, through poets and prophets 
and dreamers, to enter the con- 
sciousness of man. Dreamers drove 
man to be free when he feared 
freedom. A few centuries later 
they drove him into space, shrink- 
ing and trembling. Now this. 
Dreamers, giving vent to that will 
of our species which no graybeard 
can gainsay.” 

The captain opened his eyes and 
looked again at his companion. 

“There is an old saying, Ste- 
phen : ‘Beware of the dreamer who 
dreams concretely.’ Perhaps the 

R. M. McKENNA 




Patrol version should be ‘Never put 
a dreamer in the way of dreaming 
concretely.’ I will never know for 
certain how much I have really 
had to do with this. I will be in 
grave trouble before it ends. But I 
know, as you have just learned, 
that dreams can be merciless.” 

Mr. Fishdollar smiled weakly. 
Captain Kravitz stood up and so 
did Mr. Fishdollar. The captain 
held out his hand. 

“Goodbye, Stephen,” he said. 
“Good luck, lad, and I’m proud of 
you.” 

They shook hands and Mr. Fish- 
dollar turned to the door. He 
rather thought that, just as he 
turned, the captain snapped him 
a salute. 



M R. TISHDOLLAR stumbled 
toward the settlement. People 
passed and he did not see them. 
He was not thinking. Someone ran 
squealing. Then Wendy was run- 
ning toward him, crying. 

“Stevie, Stevie, I’m so glad!” 
she sobbed against his shoulder. 
“They tried to browbeat us into 
taking another planet, but we re- 
membered and fought for your 
dream of an outpost planet. We’ve 
won, haven’t we won, Stevie?” 
“Yes, Wendy, we’ve won,” Mr. 
Fishdollar said slowly. 

She pressed closer and he hugged 
her convulsively. 



“Let’s celebrate tonight,” she 
cried. “A Thanksgiving — ” 

“All right, but let me go now, 
sweetheart. I need to think.” He 
hugged her convulsively again and 
released himself. 

Alone on the headland, he looked 
out over the sea for a long time. 
He took off his blue and gold 
tunic, folded it neatly, and thrust 
it deep into a crevice of the rock. 
The day was gray-chilly and he 
shivered in his undershirt. 

Evening drew on, red-gray over 
the water. He stood very erect with 
his chin up. He heard the signal 
gun and then the roar as Carlyle 
lifted out, and his chin rose higher. 
Finally thoughts began coming 
through the hurt. Thoughts were 
still to be had for the thinking.

snowflakes toward the settlement

The Burning of the Brain 

BY CORDWAINER SMITH 



As the ship's power failed , 
coldness and blackness and 
death would crush in on 
them . And that would be all , 
all of the Wu-Feinstein, all of 
Dolores Oh . 



1. Dolores Oh 

1 TELL YOU, it is sad, it is 
more than sad, it is fearful — 
it is a dreadful thing to go into 
the Up and Out, to fly without 
flying, to move between the stars 
as a moth may drift among the 
leaves on a summer night. 

Of all the men who took the 



84 



great ships into planoform none 
was braver, none stronger, than 
Captain Magno Taliano. 

Scanners had been gone for 
centuries and the jonasoidal effect 
had become so simple, so manage- 
able, that the traversing of light- 
years was no more difficult to most 
of the passengers of the great ships 
than to go from one room to the 
other. 

Passengers moved easily. 

Not the crew. 

Least of all the captain. 

The captaincy of a jonasoidal 
ship which embarked on an inter- 
stellar journey was a man subject 
to rare and overwhelming strains. 
The art of getting past all the 
complications of space was far more 
like the piloting of turbulent waters 
in ancient days than like the smooth 
seas which legendary men once 
traversed with sails alone. 

Go-Captain on the Wu-Feinstein , 
finest ship of its class, was Magno 
Taliano. 

Of him it was said, “He could 
sail through hell with the muscles 
of his left eye alone. He could 
plow space with his living brain if 
the instruments failed. .” 

Wife to the Go-Captain was 
Dolores Oh. The name was Ja- 
ponical, from some nation of the 
ancient days. Dolores Oh had been 
once beautiful, so beautiful that 
she took men’s breath away, made 
wise men into fools, made young 
men into nightmares of lust and 
yearning. Wherever she went men 
had quarreled and fought over her. 

But Dolores Oh was proud be- 
yond all common limits of pride. 
She refused to go through the 

85 



ordinary rejuvenescence. A terrible 
yearning a hundred or so years 
back must have come over her. Per- 
haps she said to herself, before 
that hope and terror which a 
mirror in a quiet room becomes to 
anyone, 

“Surely I am me. There must 
be a me more than the beauty of 
my face, there must be a something 
other than the delicacy of skin 
and the accidental lines of my jaw 
and my cheekbone. 

“What have men loved if it 
wasn’t me? Can I ever find out 
who I am or what I am if I don’t 
let beauty perish and live on in 
whatever flesh age gives me?” 

She had met the Go-Captain 
and ‘had married him in a romance 
that left forty planets talking and 
half the ship lines stunned. 

Magno Taliano was at the very 
beginning of his genius. Space, we 
can tell you, is rough — rough like 
the wildest of storm-driven waters, 
filled with perils which only the 
most sensitive, the quickest, the 
most daring of men can surmount. 

Best of them all, class for class, 
age for age, out of class, beating 
the best of his seniors, was Magno 
Taliano. 

For him to marry the most 
beautiful beauty of forty worlds 
was a wedding like Eloise and 
Abelard’s, or like the unforgettable 
romance of Helen America and Mr. 
Grey-no-more. 

The ships of the Go-Captain 
Magno Taliano became more beau- 
tiful year by year, century by cen- 
tury. 

As ships became better he always 
obtained the best. He maintained 




his lead over the other Go-Captains 
so overwhelmingly that it was un- 
thinkable for the finest ship of man- 
kind to sail out amid the rough- 
nesses and uncertainties of two- 
dimensional space without him- 
self at the helm. 

Stop-Captains were proud to sail 
space beside him. (Though the 
Stop-Captains had nothing more 
to do than to check the mainte- 
nance of the ship, its loading and 
unloading when it was in normal 
space, they were still more than 
ordinary men in their own kind of 
world, a world far below the more 
majestic and adventurous universe 
of the Go- Cap tains.) 

Magno Taliano had a niece who 
in the modern style used a place in- 
stead of a name: she was called 
“Dita from the Great South 
House.” 

When Dita came aboard the Wu- 
Feinstein she had heard much of 
Dolores Oh, her aunt by marriage 
who had once captivated the men 
in many worlds. Dita was wholly 
unprepared for what she found. 

Dolores greeted her civilly 
enough, but the civility was a suck- 
ing pump of hideous anxiety, the 
friendliness was the driest of mock- 
eries, the greeting itself an attack. 

“What’s the matter with the 
woman?” thought Dita. 

As if to answer her thought, 
Dolores said aloud and in words: 
“It’s nice to meet a woman who’s 
not trying to take Taliano from 
me. I love him. Can you believe 
that? Can you?” 

“Of course,” said Dita. She 
looked at the ruined face of Dolores 
Oh, at the dreaming terror in 

86 



Dolores’ eyes, and she realized that 
Dolores had passed all limits of 
nightmare and had become a verit- 
able demon of regret, a possessive 
ghost who sucked the vitality from 
her husband, who dreaded com- 
panionship, hated friendship, re- 
jected even the most casual of ac- 
quaintances, because she feared 
forever and without limit that 
there was really nothing to her- 
self, and feared that without Mag- 
no Taliano she would be more lost 
than the blackest of whirlpools in 
the nothing between the stars. 

Magno Taliano came in. 

He saw his wife and niece to- 
gether. 

He must have been used to 
Dolores Oh. In Dita’s eyes Dolores 
was more frightening than a mud- 
caked reptile raising its wounded 
and venomous head with blind 
hunger and blind rage. To Magno 
Taliano the ghastly woman who 
stood like a witch beside him was 
somehow the beautiful girl he had 
wooed and had married one 
hundred sixty-four years before. 

He kissed the withered cheek, he 
stroked the dried and stringy hair, 
he looked into the greedy terror- 
haunted eyes as though they were 
the eyes of a child he loved. He 
said, lightly and gently, 

“Be good to Dita, my dear.” 

He went on through the lobby 
of the ship to the inner sanctum 
of the pianoforming room. 

The Stop-Captain waited for 
him. Outside on the world of Sher- 
man the scented breezes of that 
pleasant planet blew in through 
the open windows of the ship. 

Wu-Feinstein , finest ship of its 

CORDWAINER SMITH 




class, had no need for metal walls. 
It was built to resemble an ancient, 
pre-historic estate named Mount 
Vernon, and when it sailed between 
the stars it was encased in its own 
rigid and self-renewing field of 
force. 

The passengers went through a 
few pleasant hours of strolling on 
the grass, enjoying the spacious 
rooms, chatting beneath a mar- 
velous simulacrum of an atmos- 
phere-filled sky. 

Only in the pianoforming room 
did the Go-Captain know what 
happened. The Go-Captain, his 
Pinlighters sitting beside him, took 
the ship from one compression to 
another, leaping hotly and franti- 
cally through space, sometimes one 
light year, sometimes a hundred 
light years, jump, jump, jump, 
jump until the ship, the light 
touches of the captain’s mind guid- 
ing it, passed the perils of millions 
upon millions of worlds, came out 
at its appointed destination and 
settled as lightly as one feather 
resting upon others, settled into an 
embroidered and decorated coun- 
tryside where the passengers could 
move as easily away from their 
journey as if they had done noth- 
ing more than to pass an afternoon 
in a pleasant old house by the side 
of a river. 



2 . The Lost Locksheet 

M AGNO TALIANO nodded to 
his Pinlighters. The Stop- 
Captain bowed obsequiously from 
the doorway of the pianoforming 
room. Taliano looked at him stern- 



ly, but with robust friendliness. 
With formal and austere courtesy 
he asked, 

“Sir and colleague, is everything 
ready for the jonasoidal effect?” 

The Stop-Captain bowed even 
more formally. “Truly ready, sir 
and master.” 

“The Locksheet in place?” 

“Truly in place, sir and master.” 

“The passengers secure?” 

“The passengers are secure, 
numbered, happy and ready, sir 
and master.” 

Then came the last and the most 
serious of questions. “Are my Pin- 
lighters warmed with their pinsets 
and ready for combat?” 

“Ready for combat, sir and 
master.” With these words the 
Stop-Captain withdrew. Magno 
Taliano smiled to his Pinlighters. 
All Pinlighters were telepathic. 
Through the minds of all of them 
there passed the same thought. 

“How could a man that pleasant 
stay married all those years to a 
hag like Dolores Oh? How could 
that witch, that horror, have ever 
been a beauty? How could that 
beast have ever been a woman, 
particularly the divine and glamor- 
ous Dolores Oh whose image we 
still see in four-di every now and 
then?” 

Yet pleasant he was, though long 
he may have been married to 
Dolores Oh. Her loneliness and 
greed might suck at him like a 
nightmare, but his strength was 
more than enough strength for two. 

Was he not the captain of the 
greatest ship to sail between the 
stars? 

Even as the Pinlighters smiled 

87 



A.D. 2500: THE BURNING OF THE BRAIN 




their greetings back to him, his 
right hand depressed the golden 
ceremonial lever of the ship. This 
instrument alone was mechanical. 
All other controls in the ship had 
long since been formed telepathical- 
ly or electronically. 

Within the pianoforming room 
the black skies became visible and 
the tissue of space shot up around 
them like boiling water at the base 
of a waterfall. Outside that one 
room the passengers still walked 
sedately on scented lawns. 

From the wall facing him, as 
he sat rigid in his Go-Captain’s 
chair, Magno Taliano sensed the 
forming of a pattern which in three 
or four hundred milliseconds would 
tell him where he was and would 
give him the next clue as to how 
to move. 

He moved the ship with the 
impulses of his own brain, to which 
the wall was a superlative comple- 
ment. 

The wall was a living brickwork 
of locksheets, laminated charts, one 
hundred thousand charts to the 
inch, the wall pre-selected and pre- 
assembled for all imaginable con- 
tingencies of the journey which, 
each time afresh, took the ship 
across half unknown immensities 
of time and space. The ship leapt, 
as it had before. 

The new star focused. 

Magno Taliano waited for the 
wall to show him where he was, 
expecting (in partnership with the 
wall) to flick the ship back into 
the pattern of stellar space, moving 
it by immense skips from source to 
destination. 

This time nothing happened. 



“Nothing?” 

For the first time in a hundred 
years his mind knew panic. 

It couldn’t be nothing. Not noth - 
ing. Something had to focus. The 
locksheets always focused. 

His mind reached into the lock- 
sheets and he realized with a devas- 
tation beyond all limits of ordinary 
human grief that they were lost 
as no ship had ever been lost be- 
fore. By some error never before 
committed in the history of man- 
kind, the entire wall was made of 
duplicates of the same locksheet. 

Worst of all, the Emergency Re- 
turn Sheet was lost. There were 
midstars none of them had ever 
seen before, perhaps as little as five 
hundred million miles, perhaps as 
far as forty parsecs. 

And the locksheet was lost. 

And they would die. 

As the ship’s power failed cold- 
ness and blackness and death 
would crush in on them in a few 
hours at the most. That then would 
be all, all of the Wu-Feinstein , all 
of Dolores Oh. 



3 . The Secret of the 
Old Dark Brain 

O UTSIDE of the pianoforming 
room of the Wu-Feinstein the 
passengers had no reason to under- 
stand that they were marooned in 
the nothing-at-all. 

Dolores Oh rocked back and 
forth in an ancient rocking chair. 
Her haggard face looked without 
pleasure at the imaginary river 
that ran past the edge of the lawn. 
Dita from the Great South House 



88 



CORDWAINER SMITH 




sat on a hassock by her aunt’s 
knees. 

Dolores was talking about a trip 
she had made when she was young 
and vibrant with beauty, a beauty 
which brought trouble and hate 
wherever it went. 

“. so the guardsman killed 
the captain and then came to my 
cabin and said to me, ‘You’ve got 
to marry me now. I’ve given up 
everything for your sake,’ and I 
said to him, ‘I never said that I 
loved you. It was sweet of you to 
get into a fight, and in a way I 
suppose it is a compliment to my 
beauty, but it doesn’t mean that I 
belong to you the rest of my life. 
What do you think I am, any- 
how?’ ” 

Dolores Oh sighed a dry, ugly 
sigh, like the crackling of subzero 
winds through frozen twigs. “So 
you see, Dita, being beautiful the 
way you are is no answer to any- 
thing. A woman has got to be her- 
self before she finds out what she is. 
I know that my lord and husband, 
the Go-Captain, loves me because 
my beauty is gone, and with my 
beauty gone there is nothing but 
me to love, is there?” 

An odd figure came out on the 
verandah. It was a Pinlighter in 
full fighting costume. Pinlighters 
were never supposed to leave the 
pianoforming room, and it was 
most extraordinary for one of them 
to appear among the passengers 
when the ship was in flight. 

He bowed to the two ladies and 
said with the utmost courtesy, 

“Ladies, will you please come 
into the pianoforming room? We 
have need that you should see the 



Go-Captain now.” 

Dolores’ hand leapt to her 
mouth. Her gesture of grief was 
as automatic as the striking of a 
snake. Dita sensed that her aunt 
had been waiting a hundred years 
and more for disaster, that her 
aunt had craved ruin for her hus- 
band the way that some people 
crave love and others crave death. 

Dita said nothing. Neither did 
Dolores, apparently at second 
thought, utter a word. 

They followed the Pinlighter 
silently into the pianoforming 
room. 

The heavy door closed behind 
them. 

Magno Taliano was still rigid 
in his Captain’s chair. 

He spoke very slowly, his voice 
sounding like a record played too 
slowly on an ancient parlophone. 

“We are lost in space , my dear,” 
said the frigid, ghostly voice of the 
Captain, still in his Go-Captain’s 
trance. “We are lost in space and 
1 thought that perhaps if your 
mind aided mine we might think of 
a way back ” 

Dita started to speak. 

A Pinlighter told her: “Go ahead 
and speak, my dear. Do you have 
any suggestion?” 

“Why don’t we just go back? It 
would be humiliating, wouldn’t it? 
Still it would be better than dying. 
Let’s use the Emergency Return 
Locksheet and go on right back. 
The world will forgive Magno 
Taliano for a single failure after 
thousands of brilliant and success- 
ful trips.” 

The Pinlighter, a pleasant enough 
young man, was as friendly and 

89 



A.D. 2500: THE BURNING OF THE BRAIN 




calm as a doctor informing some- 
one of a death or of a mutilation. 
“The impossible has happened, 
Dita from the Great South House. 
All the Locksheets are wrong. They 
are all the same one. And not one 
of them is good for emergency re- 
turn.” 

With that the two women knew 
where they were. They knew that 
space would tear into them like 
threads being pulled out of a fiber 
so that they would either die bit by 
bit as the hours passed and as the 
material of their bodies faded away 
a few molecules here and a few 
there. Or, alternatively, they could 
die all at once in a flash if the Go- 
Captain chose to kill himself and 
the ship rather than to wait for a 
slow death. Or, if they believed in 
religion, they could pray. 

The Pinlighter said, “We think 
we see a familiar pattern at the 
edge of your own brain. May we 
look in?” 

Taliano nodded very slowly, very 
gravely. 

The Pinlighter stood still. 

The two women watched. Noth- 
ing visible happened, but they 
knew that beyond the limits of vi- 
sion and yet before their eyes a great 
drama was being played out. The 
minds of the Pinlighters probed 
deep into the mind of the frozen 
Go-Captain, searching amid the 
synapses for the secret of the faint- 
est clue to their possible rescue. 

Minutes passed. They seemed 
like hours. 

At last the Pinlighter spoke. “We 
can see into your midbrain, Cap- 
tain. At the edge of your paleo- 
cortex there is a star pattern which 

90 



resembles the upper left rear of our 
present location.” 

The Pinlighter laughed nerv- 
ously. “We want to know can you 
fly the ship home on your brain?” 
Magno Taliano looked with 
deep tragic eyes at the inquirer. 
His slow voice came out at them 
once again since he dared not leave 
the half-trance which held the en- 
tire ship in stasis. “Do you mean 
can 1 fly the ship on a brain alone? 
It would burn out my brain and 
the ship would be lost anyhow. 

“But we’re lost, lost, lost,” 
screamed Dolores Oh. Her face was 
alive with hideous hope, with a 
hunger for ruin, with a greedy wel- 
come of disaster. She screamed at 
her husband, “Wake up, my dar- 
ling, and let us die together. At 
least we can belong to each other 
that much, that long, forever!” 
“Why die?” said the Pinlighter 
softly. “You tell him, Dita.” 

Said Dita, “Why not try, sir and 
uncle?” 

Slowly Magno Taliano turned his 
face toward his knees. Again his 
hollow voice sounded. “If I do this 
I shall be a fool or a child or a dead 
man, but I will do it for you ” 
Dita had studied the work of the 
Go-Captains and she knew well 
enough that if the paleocortex was 
lost the personality became intel- 
lectually sane, but emotionally 
crazed. With the most ancient part 
of the brain gone the fundamental 
controls of hostility, hunger and 
sex disappeared. The most fero- 
cious of animals and the most bril- 
liant of men were reduced to a 
common level — a level of infantile 
friendliness in which lust and play- 

CORDWAINER SMITH 




fulness and gentle, unappeasable 
hunger became the eternity of their 
days. 

Magno Taliano did not wait. 

He reached out a slow hand and 
squeezed the hand of Dolores Oh. 
“As I die you shall at last be sure 
1 love you” 

Once again the women saw noth- 
ing. They realized they had been 
called in simply to give Magno 
Taliano a last glimpse of his own 
life. 

A quiet Pinlighter thrust a 
beam-electrode so that it reaohed 
square into the paleocortex of Cap- 
tain Magno Taliano. 

The pianoforming room came to 
life. Strange heavens swirled about 
them like milk being churned in a 
bowl. 

Dita realized that her partial 
capacity of telepathy was function- 
ing even without the aid of a ma- 
chine. With her mind she could 
feel the dead wall of the locksheets. 
She was aware of the rocking of 
the Wu-Feinstein as it leapt from 
space to space, as uncertain as a 
man crossing a river by leaping 
from one ice-covered rock to the 
other. 

In a strange way she even knew 
that the paleocortical part of her 
uncle’s brain was burning out at 
last and forever, that the star pat- 
terns which had been frozen in the 
locksheets lived on in the infinitely 
complex pattern of his own mem- 
ories, and that with the help of his 
own telepathic Pinlighters he was 
burning out his brain cell by cell 
in order for them to find a way to 
the ship’s destination. This indeed 
was his last trip. 



Dolores Oh watched her husband 
with a hungry greed surpassing all 
expression. 

Little by little his face became re- 
laxed and stupid. 

Dita could see the midbrain be- 
ing burned blank, as the ship’s con- 
trols with the help of the Pinlight- 
ers searched through the most mag- 
nificent intellect of its time for a 
last course into harbor. 

Suddenly Dolores Oh was on her 
knees, sobbing by the hand of her 
husband. 

A Pinlighter took Dita by the 
arm. 

“We have reached destination,” 
he said. 

“And my uncle?” 

The Pinlighter looked at her 
strangely. 

She realized he was speaking to 
her without moving his lips — speak- 
ing mind-to-mind with pure telep- 
athy. 

“Can’t you see it?” 

She shook her head dazedly. 

The Pinlighter thought his em- 
phatic statement at her once again. 

“As your uncle burned out his 
brain, you picked up his skills. 
Can’t you sense it? You are a Go- 
Captain yourself and one of the 
greatest of us.” 

“And he?” 

The Pinlighter thought a merci- 
ful comment at her. 

Magno Taliano had risen from 
his chair and was being led from 
the room by his wife and consort, 
Dolores Oh. He had the amiable 
smile of an idiot, and his face for 
the first time in more than a hun- 
dred years trembled with shy and 
silly love. END

A.D. 2500: THE BURNING OF THE BRAIN 




When the planets die , when the friendly stars grow cold, man 
the ephemeral will still be searching for new habitations, 
and new adventures of the spirit . Then comes the 
day when he stands at the edge of the darkened 
Milky Way, and looks across the million- 
year gulf between galaxies . ♦ 



BY DEAN MCLAUGHLIN 



O LIVING MAN remembered 
the beginning of the cataclysm. 
It had lasted a million years — far 
too long even for a people whose 
science had extended the average 
life span to three thousand years. 
But of all the living things in the 
galaxy, only men and those crea- 
tures protected by men survived. 

The invader galaxy had ap- 
proached the home galaxy in the 
plane of its spiral arms. It was ob- 
scured from men’s early civiliza- 
tions by the clouds of dust and 
hydrogen that clogged the spiral 
arms. Its coming was unheralded. 

It struck like the blast of a thou- 
sand supernovae. Yet, strangely, 
not one star of the invader crashed 
into a star of the home galaxy. 
Even in the crowded central globe, 
a galaxy is mosdy empty space. The 
two star systems interpenetrated. 



Their stars slipped past each other 
— rarely close — deflected each 
other’s motions into new paths, and 
went blindly on. 

But the gas and dust clouds of 
the two colliding galaxies — which 
comprised fully half their mass — 
did meet. Carried on by the mo- 
mentum which they shared with 
their respective galaxies, they 
smashed into each other and 
erupted with incandescent fury. 
Fearful radiations were generated. 
Everything died within a hundred 
light years of the impact. 

And, as the invader plunged un- 
opposed through the galaxy in 
macroscopic slow motion, its inter- 
stellar clouds came with it. Im- 
peded by the home galaxy’s own 
interstellar clouds, the wave front 
of impact fell behind the invader. 
But it drove on irresistibly across the 




CREATION 




galaxy, radiating death ahead of it 
— leaving behind it worlds stripped 
of life, and the tragic artifacts and 
cities of a million civilizations never 
known by men. 

The human race was luckier 
than most. The invader was almost 
a million years crossing the galaxy, 
and the sight of its forward- leaning 
spiral arm arched up over the 
Milky Way like a scorpion’s fang 
was sufficient forewarning to allow 
a fraction of humanity to escape. 

Necessity and human ingenuity 
have been the parents of progress 
since the first protohuman — phys- 
ically puny and beset by enemies — 
discovered a use for tree limbs not 
anticipated by the laws of natural 
selection. So it was that again hu- 
man genius found a way to salva- 
tion. 

It would have done no good to 
flee ahead of the advancing con- 
flagration. The edge of the galaxy 
was only ten thousand light years 
away, and when the invader closed 
in they could go no further. There 
would be no place to go. 

Nor could they plunge through 
the bath of deadly radiation. 

So men invented transposition, 
by which they could arrive at any 
point without the need of passing 
through the space between. It fell 
short of the lost ideal of travel 
faster than light — for a ship moved 
by transposition could not arrive 
any sooner than light from the 
same point and instant of origin — 
but it was enough to meet the needs 
of the time. 

It allowed the survivors to pass 
beyond the deadly wave front 
without passing through it. 

94 



In arks — some well equipped 
and some equipped not at all — a 
small part of the human race 
escaped to the already devastated 
parts of the galaxy. There, on plan- 
ets void of life — but full of the 
relics and leavings of life — they 
found refuge. Some did not sur- 
vive, for men are dependent for 
life on many other living things, 
and all the living things they had 
at their disposal were the ones they 
brought with them. Some — in the 
effort of staying alive — retreated 
into savagery, even cannibalism. 
Many forgot their heritage, their 
history, their science, and their 
gods. Some chose the wrong 
worlds, and were carried back into 
the conflagration by the galaxy’s 
slow rotation. 

But some did survive, and a few 
even kept their knowledge of the 
transposition way of travel. In time, 
there arose a loosely- joined con- 
federation among the stars. And 
commerce. And the exchange of 
ideas and knowledge. 

By then, the invader was long 
since gone on its blundering flight 
through the cosmos — and men 
looking up at the night sky saw 
the same disaster overtake the An- 
dromeda galaxy — saw a cataclysm 
that had happened a million and 
a half years before, the sight of 
which was only now 7 coming to 
them. 

For the invader was only one 
rogue of a cluster of rogues. Men 
traced the incredibly slow passage 
of the cluster through the sky — 
knowing that although they were 
seeing them now, by light that had 
left them millions of years before, 

dean McLaughlin 




the galaxies themselves had already c 
passed and gone on — perhaps to- r 

ward other cataclysms which, for r 

all they knew, might have already I 
happened. t 

I 

But that was not all the disaster, a 
although men went a long time be- i< 
fore they discovered it. And when 
they discovered it, they were slow to 
realize it was a disaster — for it 
seemed a very unimportant thing, c 
Not for almost a hundred thousand 
years did they realize how fatal it c 
was. t 

It was a simple thing: the dust 1 
and gas clouds were gone from the f 
sky. In smashing its way across the c 
galaxy, the invader’s gas and dust r 
clouds had imparted to the clouds 1: 
of the home galaxy a new proper 
motion. The two sets of clouds c 
merged — became a single mass 
which coasted through the home t 
galaxy, gobbling up all the clouds t 
in its path. And carried on by in- i 
ertia, the great cloud — having s 

swept the home galaxy clean — z 

drifted onward into intergalactic t 

space. < 

It was possible, with the gas and i 
dust gone, for men to see from one c 
edge of the galaxy to the other, 
even through the central globe, t 

They found it difficult to imagine i 
a time when that had not been t 
possible. So they did not realize it < 
was a disaster. 1 

But astronomers rediscovered 
that the universe was expanding — i 

as though from an explosion which i 
was finally calculated to have taken > 
place six billion years before. They t 

discovered that, while the stars of ( 

the central globe and of globular \ 

A.D. 32,000,000: BRINK OF CREATION 



clusters might be nearly as ancient, 
many stars of the spiral arms could 
not possibly have burned for that 
long — long since, they would have 
used up their hydrogen, and their 
helium . would have transmuted 
all their available atoms into heav- 
ier elements, and died. 

But instead they burned fiercely 
— the brightest stars in the night. 

Therefore, they were of a later 
creation. 

Loose clusters of stars were dis- 
covered — stars whose proper mo- 
tions, traced back, showed them to 
have come almost simultaneously 
from the same region. Many were 
obviously young stars, only a few 
million years old. They must have 
been created in those regions. 

But there was nothing there that 
could have created them. 

With that, the matter rested un- 
til study of extragalactic nebulae — 
the only kind known any more — 
revealed that other galaxies pos- 
sessed thick clouds of black dust, 
and astronomers were reminded 
that the home galaxy, also, had 
once had such clouds. And those 
nebulae which did not have these 
clouds, did not have spiral arms. 

The lesson was plain. The home 
galaxy would never bear another 
new star. And, with the passage of 
time, the existing stars would burn 
out. Men would have no place to 
live — not one world fit to live on. 

That fate was still a hundred 
million years in the future. But 
now, men with foresight argued, 
was the time to make provision for 
that time. For the only hope of 
escaping the fate of the galaxy 
was to move to a galaxy which — 



95 




with hydrogen and dust clouds — 
was replacing its burnt-out stars 
just as a living body replaces dy- 
ing cells. 

Since the nearest promising gal- 
axy was millions of light years 
away, and because there would be, 
in addition, the problem of locat- 
ing its present position — an explor- 
atory ship would certainly use up 
tens of millions of years in the 
course of scouting a galaxy and 
returning with a report. 

The nearest galaxies were stud- 
ied. Some — the small ones and 
the ones void of dust — were re- 
jected at once. The others were 
marked for close-hand study. 

Ships were built, equipped, and 
staffed. They were sent out, each 
to its assigned galaxy. The men 
aboard them went, knowing that 
before they returned even planets 
and stars they had known would 
have vanished — that they could 
not come back to anything they 
had left behind. 



G RIFF HAD LEFT behind ev- 
erything — the homes he had 
known, the friends, and family, and 
property, and every small familiar 
thing. Before he returned, the most 
lasting of these would have rotted 
and crumbled and mixed with the 
dust of tens of millions of years. 
Even the stars would have changed. 

And — though he steadfastly 
doubted it — the human race might 
be gone from the universe. 

It was the starjumper’s fate, of 
course. A little of it happened ev- 
ery time he transpositioned stellar 
distances. But the leaps were short 



— rarely more than a dozen or a 
score of light years, and when he 
returned not much had really 
changed. 

But this time, in one great leap, 
Fikret Griff had forever separated 
himself from all his former life. By 
his own choice, he was here aboard 
the Royan , storming the brink of 
eternity itself. 

In the telescope blister, strapped 
in a chair in darkness, Griff moni- 
tored the Royan ’ s slow, deliberate, 
spiralling needle sweep of the en- 
tire celestial sphere. Before him, 
the large globe-chart slowly turned, 
and on its face, always toward him, 
a flickering small square of light 
gradually crept downward from 
pole to equator. Now and then 
a faint, shrill peep announced the 
end of a film reel. The chart 
stopped turning, and the square of 
light steadied and held its position. 

Griff twisted around to the tele- 
scope camera and refilled its mag- 
azine with a new spool of film. 
Slotting the exposed reel in the 
storage rack, he touched a control. 
The globe began to turn again. The 
bright square edged toward the 
equator. 

It was like' looking at the uni- 
serse from the outside. But, to his 
eyes, it was a very poor universe — 
blackness broken by only the fee- 
blest of gleams. Only one galaxy 
was near enough to be even a smear 
of misty, cold light. A few more 
were flecks of pale luminescence. 
All the rest — nor were there many 
— were tiny, faint sparks. 

The illuminated square crossed 
the equator and continued down- 
ward. At each revolution of the 



96 



dean McLaughlin 




globe, it descended not quite its 
own width. Griff watched, and 
changed reels, and watched again. 

To see the universe this way — 
seemingly outside looking in — was 
not the fearful thing that seeing it 
the other way had been. Just after 
the Royan emerged in this region 
of space, he had climbed the lad- 
der to the observation bubble. 
There, breathlessly frozen, he had 
found himself in the presence of a 
vast, blotting blackness which 
seemed so near and solid that, if 
he reached out, its hard, reflection- 
less surface would stop his hand. 
Nowhere in that blackness was 
there anything his eyes could fix on. 

He was a mote in the wastes of 
endlessness. 

Numb and tranced, he had come 
back down the ladder. Where he 
wandered in the ship, or how long 
he walked, he afterwards could not 
remember. But for hours, only the 
hard deck underfoot assured him 
that anything was real. 

The globe was different. It was 
a size his mind could comprehend, 
and it was a thing he looked into 
from the outside. It did not bear 
down on him the knowledge of his 
infinite smallness. 

It continued to turn. The lighted 
square continued downward. Fi- 
nally, it reached the pole. The 
globe stopped turning. Griff re- 
moved the film spool from the 
telescope camera. Taking the other 
reels from their rack, he sealed 
them in a lightproof case. Then he 
allowed the lights to come on. 

The first step of the job was 
begun. 



Back in his quarters, he put the 
film through the treatment ma- 
chine. He checked it for flaws, but 
it was flawless. Then he rested. 

The next day he gave Ship- 
master Amiro a set of guidance 
chits, and the Royan transposi- 
tioned to its second station, a hun- 
dred light years away. There, Griff 
again recorded the celestial sphere. 

Another day passed before he 
made his report to the shipmaster, 
and it was with a feeling of in- 
adequacy — of bewilderment in the 
face of unanticipated difficulties — 
that he opened the door to the 
shipmaster’s quarters. 

He stopped on the threshold, 
cold. Standing there, waiting with 
the shipmaster — his broad back to 
the computer console — was Bron 
Klystro, the survey captain. 

“Well, have you found it, young 
man?” the survey captain de- 
manded. 

Full of misgivings, Griff made 
himself walk over to the study desk. 
He unclipped a pack of photo 
plates from his board and laid them 
in a row. Shipmaster Det Amiro 
and the survey captain bent to 
examine them. 

“It is one of these seven,” Griff 
said, swallowing uncomfortably. 

Each plate showed a galaxy. 
Three were normal spirals, but all 
of them crude — their sprawling, 
tentacular arms like misshapen 
swastikas. Two more were ellipti- 
cal, with totally featureless, egg- 
shaped bodies. Of the remaining 
two, one had no shape; the other 
was a barred spiral whose fat-el- 
bowed, thin, threadlike arms trailed 
clockwise from its knob-centered. 



A.D. 32,000,000: BRINK OF CREATION 



97 




rod-like nucleus. 

Klystro straightened up. “It is 
none of these,” he said evenly. 
“Young man . .” 

“The parallax check showed all 
the others are more than fifteen mil- 
lion light years away,” Griff said. 

“Have you a plate of Likert’s 
Nebula?” Amiro asked. 

Griff unclipped it from his 
board and laid it on the desk. The 
galaxy was a beautiful, symmetrical 
whorl of snowy light. It looked not 
at all like any of the seven. 

“In thirty million years, it could 
have changed,” Griff said without 
conviction. 

“Not this much,” Klystro said. 
“In fact, it could never have 
evolved into any of these. Never in 
all the time since the universe be- 
gan.” 

He gestured do,wn the row' of 
photo plates. “Young man, y Qtf 
have made a mistake.” 

Griff had checked and re- 
checked, but the comparitor 'had 
doggedly shown only the seven a£ 
having parallaxes which placed 
them less than fifteen million light 
years away. Finally, he had reset 
the machine to select all the gal- 
axies within thirty million, light 
years, and had winnowed through 
the dozens that came out. 

The conclusion was the same. 
Likert’s Nebula had to be one of 
the seven. 

Doubting everything, Griff had 
rechecked the Royan's position. He 
identified the home galaxy, a not 
very difficult task, because the 
Royan still shared the home gal- 
axy’s proper motion. Careful study 
of fixed galaxies showed that the 



Roy art's position was along a line 
drawn between the home galaxy 
and the place where Likert’s Neb- 
ula had been thirty million years 
ago. Examination of the fixed gal- 
axies in the opposite direction hacj 
confirmed that the Royan was on 
that direction line, and a parallax 
reading on the home galaxy had 
shown that the Royan was fifteen 
million light years away. 

The* conclusion was inescapable. 
The Royan was exactly where it 
was supposed tor be. Likert’s Neb- 
ula, therefore, had to be one of 
the seven. 

“Either it has disappeared en- 
tirely, or it is moving faster than 
light,” Griff argued. “Or else — 
it is one of these seven.” 

“Impossible,” Klystro said, and 
shut his jaw hard. 

“I disagree,” Shipmaster Amiro 
said. “It is one of those seven.” 
“Nevertheless, it is* not,” Klystro 
insisted. “Perhaps, young man, you 
would care to explain how Likert’s 
Nebula — a third stage symmetrical 
galaxy — could have evolved into 
agy one of these seven.” 

Griff stiffened speechlessly. He 
had no answer. 

Amiro said, “You, Survey Cap- 
tain, are the authority on galactic 
Structure here. If anyone must make 
an explanation, you are he. The fact 
is, Survey Captain, that Likert’s 
Nebula was here thirty million 
years ago. These seven, by reason 
of their positions, are the only ones 
that could have been here then. All 
others are too far away. Therefore, 
one of these is Likert’s Nebula.” He 
turned to Griff. “Can you decide 
which one?”

"I think I can, Shipmaster,” c 

Griff said. “But not without mov^ 
ing ship.” s 

“Then we shall move it,” Amiro b 

said. “What displacement?” r 

“We need a second set of paral- b 

lax sightings,” Griff told him. f 

“From the same positions, but after e 

a thousand-year lapse.” 

“How do you propose to do s 

that?” Klystro demanded. ; 

Griff explained. By transposition- t 

ing away in any direction five r 

hundred light years, and then re- s 

turning, they would arrive one f 

thousand years later. r 

With the second set of parallax 's 

sightings, it would be possible to c 

compute the proper motions of the j 

seven galaxies. Knowing both the 
direction and speed of each — and r 

making allowance for the time t 

elapsed since the light now seen 1 

had left them — Griff could deter- i 

mine which of them had been 1 

Likert’s Nebula thirty million years c 

before. 

It should have been simple.

I T WAS A GOOD thing the 1 

shipmaster was on his side, be- ) 

cause when he reported his analysis 
of the two sets of parallax sightings, t 
Survey Captain Klystro nearly > 

kicked a hole in the deck. ] 

The results maddeningly indi- 
cated that none of the seven gal- s 
axies had passed through the re- } 
gion where Likert’s Nebula had i 

been. But two had passed close — ) 

both within a million years of the c 
proper date. Griff laid photo plates ( 

of the two galaxies on the study ] 
desk. One was an elliptical; the f

other was the barred spiral. 

That was as far as he got. Kly- 
stro turned his narrow face and 
burning eyes to him. “Young 
man,” he said bitterly, “your 
bungling has now lost us com- 
pletely. We will be lucky if we 
ever find our way home.” 

Griff’s mouth opened, but Kly- 
stro went on without a pause. 
“Shipmaster, I suggest you assign 
the duties of your guidance depart- 
ment to my staff — since your own 
staff has proven incompetent. I 
further suggest that, as we now have 
no hope of finding Likert’s Nebula, 
we should select the nearest of the 
crude spirals as an alternate ob- 
jective.” 

Amiro listened patiently. He 
rubbed his jaw and strolled over 
to the plotting sphere. The colored 
lights that represented the seven 
galaxies gleamed steadily. He 
leaned his weight on the broad, 
concave pedestal, peering down. 
Then he turned. 

“It was my understanding,” he 
said slowly, “that crude-form gal- 
axies such as those would not have 
livable planets for another billion 
years.” 

“That is so, according to a 
theory of galactic evolution to 
which I have never subscribed,” 
Klystro said acidly. 

Amiro nodded. “My charter,” he 
said patiently, “directs me to deliver 
you and your staff to Likert’s Neb- 
ula, and to cooperate with you in 
your survey. I will not violate that 
charter. Furthermore, I am not 
convinced that we cannot find 
Likert’s Nebula. My guidance of- 
ficer has already limited it to one 



99 




of two possibilities.” 

“Those two?” Klystro demanded. 
“The elliptical is worthless, and the 
other is almost as bad.” He ges- 
tured to the photo plates. “Look at 
them — practically no dust clouds in 
either.” 

“If it is either one, it has changed 
considerably in thirty million years,” 
Amiro pointed out. “Can you pre- 
dict how they will change in an- 
other few million?” 

“Hardly at all,” Klystro said. 
“With no dust clouds, they can- 
not form planets. A few stars might 
condense out of gas clouds, but it 
is doubtful, and any planets would 
be large, sub-stellar bodies with 
low density. Completely unlivable.” 
Amiro nodded patiently. “We 
were assigned to survey Likert’s 
Nebula,” he repeated. “We will 
find it and go there.” He glanced at 
Griff significantly. “Can you de- 
termine which one was Likert’s?” 
“I think I can, shipmaster,” 
Griff said. “I believe it’s the barred 
spiral.” 

He wished he could speak with 
more certainty; but the facts were 
not entirely conclusive. 

The factor that cast doubt on 
everything was that the two gal- 
axies must have passed close to 
each other. Griff could not be sure 
exactly how close, because that de- 
pended on their masses — which he 
did not know. Certainly, though, 
they had passed each other close 
enough to warp their flight paths, 
and to temporarily increase their 
velocities. The degree of these al- 
terations would depend on the 
closeness of the encounter, on the 
distribution of their masses, and 

100 



the rate of propagation of a gravi- 
tational field. 

Moreover, the tidal forces of the 
two galaxies, acting on each other, 
could have changed their structure 
and their mass distribution, fur- 
ther complicating the analysis. 

But, Griff pointed out, the close- 
ness of the encounter might ex- 
plain how Likert’s Nebula had 
changed so radically. And, of the 
two possible galaxies, only the 
barred spiral bore any resemblance 
to Likert’s. 

Amiro listened and nodded. 
“Your judgement is sound. Pre- 
pare a set of chits to place us twen- 
ty-five thousand light years from 
the center of its nucleus, perpen- 
dicular to its plane.” He said to 
Klystro, “We will begin our sur- 
vey there.” 

“That galaxy is not Likert’s 
Nebula,” Klystro repeated. 

“I believe that it is.” Amiro said. 
“And we shall go there.” 

“Shipmaster, I protest.” Kly- 
stro squared his shoulders and 
looked up at Amiro venomously. 
“Let that be in the record.” 

From eighteen thousand light 
years above its roundly bulging 
crown, the barred spiral galaxy 
filled almost a whole hemisphere of 
the sky. The close-packed stars of 
its nucleus blended into each other, 
seemed a solid mass of glowing 
matter, grained and blotched with 
a dull ruddy light. From that 
center, the bar arms tapered out- 
ward, arched backward like scimi- 
tar blades, then bent sharply to 
become the trailing spiral arms. 
Out there, bright stars clustered

neighboring galaxies — immeasur- 
able and, because of their move- 
ments, constantly changing — tended 
to warp the flight paths of the two 
galaxies he was studying. 

But he had to keep at it. It was 
his only hope now, for he had failed 
miserably in his attempt to study 
the bar spiral galaxy’s present 
structure as a clue to its metamor- 
phosis. 

The trouble was, he did not know 
enough — he could not interpret 
with confidence the puzzling data 
the films revealed. 

He had expected the galaxy’s 
nucleus to show the same general 
mixture of star types as the nu- 
cleus of the home galaxy. For, ac- 
cording to theory, the primary 
origin stars of all galaxies came in- 
to being at nearly the same time — 
not quite six billion years in the 
past. 

But the stars of the nucleus did 
not conform to that pattern. There 
were too many red giants not yet 
expanded to maximum size, and 
too many variable stars, just begin- 
ning their climb from the main 
sequence. The older, declining red 
giants were not present in anything 
like their proper numbers, nor was 
Griff able to find as many as he 
had expected of the white, cooling 
corpses of stars. 

As if the galaxy was inexplicably 
younger than it had any right to 
be. 

That was nonsense. Everyone 
knew that all galaxies must have 
originated at about the same time 
— that the vast gas clouds must 
have condensed almost simultane- 
ously. For in that ancient, unknow- 

102 



able time, the universe had been 
much more closely packed than 
now, and those clouds which failed 
to contract at once would have 
been tom apart by the conflicting 
tidal forces of galaxies already 
formed. 

Griff frowned at the graph he 
had made, shrugged, and g^ve up. 
He did not know enough to fathom 
its meaning. Or perhaps he had 
made a mistake — some tyro blunder 
— and the graph was ludicrously 
wrong. 

So it had to be analysis of the 
galaxies’ flight paths. And, as the 
weeks passed, even that hope faded, 
wilted, and finally died. 

“I have absolute proof,” Klystro 
said precisely, “that this is not 
Likert’s Nebula.” 

They were in the shipmaster’s 
quarters. The big plotting sphere 
blazed with swarming brightness of 
thousands of infinitesimal star- 
sparks, in replica of the heavens 
surrounding the Roy an. In the 
center of the sphere, a green spark 
denoted the Royan’s location, and 
near it — gigantic — a fist- like black 
mass poised in abeyance, its dark 
textures limned by the internal glo\v 
of stars in the torment of being 
born. 

“Give it,” Amiro told the sur- 
vey captain. He turned to Griff. 
“I want you to hear this.” 

Griff nodded woodenly. He had 
expected something like this ever 
since *his analysis of the galaxies’ 
flight paths had shown — impossi- 
bly — the gravitational influence of 
an invisible, galaxy-sized mass. 

“Yes,” Klystro said heartily. 

dean McLaughlin 




“Young man, before we set out 
from the home galaxy, we obtained * 
an estimate of the mass of Likert’s r 
Nebula. You did not know that, 
did you?” s 

Numhly, Griff shook *his head. 
Klystro smiled. “Granted, it was \ 
only an estimate. But the efrror 
could not have been more than s 
five percent. Now, young man — e 
now we have* measured this galaxy’s t 
mass to within one thousandth — i 
and it is only a little more than c 
half the original figure. Even grant- s 
ing that its structure has radically \ 
changed — which of course is im- 1 
possible — it could not have lost 
mass. Therefore, young man, this t 
is not Likert’s Nebula.” s 

It was a heavy indictment, and t 
Griff should have smarted under 2 
it. But something in the middle t 
of Klystro’s statement, some ran- ^ 
dom fragment of thought, sudden- c 
ly filled him with a stunned excite- t 
ment. 

He did not speak. He crossed the t 
room and sat down at the compu- s 
ter board. His hands darted over ) 
the keys. s 

“Young man, what are you 
doing?” Klystro demanded. Griff c 
scarcely heard. c 

“Do you hear me?” Griff made t 
no answer. He frowned over the 
report screen, his fingers poised 1 
tensely over the keys. Then he was t 
busy again, and the screen flashed s 
and trembled and changed. Griff 
watched, his lips pressed into a 1 
thin, bloodless line. At last he c 
nodded wordlessly, satisfied. 1 

Abruptly, he stopped. He stood f 
up — turned back to Klystro and t 
the shipmaster. \ 

A.D. 32,000,000: BRINK OF CREATION 



“Shipmaster,” he announced, 
“this is Likert’s Nebula — what re- 
mains of it.” 

“I did not doubt it,” Amiro 
said calmly. 

“I suppose you can justify this 
preposterous claim?” Klystro asked. 

“I think so, Survey Captain. You 
see, the two galaxies passed through 
each other — Likert’s Nebula and 
the elliptical galaxy we observed. 
And both of them lost almost all 
of their interstellar matter — it was 
swept right out of them. We . 
we. could expect Likert’s Nebula to 
have lost almost half its mass.” 

He paused, then went on. “And 
the elliptical galaxy was smaller, 
so it did not take the clouds in 
the outermost parts of the spiral 
arms — it left a little on each side. 
And the regions where the clouds 
were left had twice the mass density 
of the rest of the galaxy. That upset 
the galaxy’s gravitational stability. 
The arms drew the stars toward 
them, wrecking the original spiral 
structure. The result was . well, 
you have seen it, Shipmaster. A bar 
spiral.” 

“Interesting,” Klystro said. “And 
can you support with proof this 
odd conglomeration of assump- 
tions?” 

“I think I can,” Griff said. He 
bent over the computer and ex- 
tracted its tape, spread it on the 
study desk. 

“These are only approximations,” 
he said. “But I think a complete 
analysis will confirm them. When 
I tried to analyze the galaxies’ 
flight paths, I discovered that I had 
to assume the existence of an in- 
visible, galaxy-sized mass to account 



103 




for their motions. But, in the 
presence of that mass, neither of 
the galaxies could have passed 
through the region where Likert’s 
Nebula was.” 

“Neither is Likert’s Nebula,” 
Klystro put in. “I have said that 
from the beginning.” 

“This barred spiral is Likert’s 
Nebula, Survey Captain,” Griff an- 
swered deliberately. “You see, if I 
postulate that the two galaxies in- 
terpenetrated, and that their in- 
terstellar matter became a separate 
body as a result, all their motions 
can be accounted for — and if I 
trace this barred spiral backward 
to a time before the encounter, we 
find that it passed through the posi- 
tion Likert’s Nebula occupied, at 
the time we know Likert’s was 
there. And it is so unlikely that 
more than one set of conditions 
could place anything within a mil- 
lion light years of the place, we 
must conclude that this is what 
happened.” 

He was right and he knew he 
was right. His rightness was a 
blaze of pleasure and excitement in 
him. No longer was he intimidated 
by this man named Klystro — no 
more did he feel compelled to 
doubt everything he himself thought 
and said and did. 

And no longer did he have to 
think of the Royarf s expedition as 
a wasted effort or a failure. Be- 
cause . because . 

“You forget, young man,” Kly- 
stro said slowly, “that a gas cloud 
detached from a galaxy in this 
manner would be torn by violent 
turbulences. I very much doubt 
that any such cloud would remain 

104 



intact for long. It would disinte- 
grate from its own internal insta- 
bility.” 

“No, survey captain,” Griff re- 
plied. “A cloud like that can hold 
together.” 

“Young man, you are imper- 
tinent,” Klystro snapped. 

“Survey Captain,” Griff repeated, 
“It has happened.” 

“Nonsense.” 

“It has happened to this galaxy 
— to Likert’s Nebula, Survey Cap- 
tain,” Griff said. “To the dust and 
gas cloud out of which it evolved. 
You must know it yourself.” 

“I know nothing of the sort.” 

“But you must admit that the 
primary-origin stars of this galaxy 
are younger than those of our home 
galaxy by at least two billion years.” 

“Well, what if they are?” Kly- 
stro demanded. 

“Why, how else can you explain 
it?” Griff demanded. “If the uni- 
verse as we know it began as an 
exploding super-atom, then all the 
galaxies must have condensed at 
approximately the same time. 
Therefore, the cloud which became 
this galaxy did not exist at that 
time. So where did it come from? It 
must have been the gas and dust 
cloud separated from its parent 
galaxy by a collision. I can think 
of no other explanation.” 

Klystro smirked coldly. “A pretty 
theory. However, it does not affect 
our mission in the slightest. This 
galaxy is practically useless, which 
after all — ” 

“But it does mean something, 
survey captain,” Griff insisted. 
“Why, it means that right now 
there must be galaxies evolving out 

dean McLaughlin 




of dark clouds. The cloud from 
Likert’s Nebula will be a galaxy 
some day, and so will the cloud 
which the invader swept out of 
our own galaxy! And there will 
always be new galaxies. Always.” 

“A fabric of suppositions,” Kly- 
tro said angrily. 

“Can you prove this?” asked 
Amiro. 

“We can try, Shipmaster,” Griff 
said. “If this is a galaxy of second- 
ary origin, the planets of its pri- 
mary-population stars should be 
similar in composition to the 
planets of secondary-origin stars 
such as we are already familiar 
with. If I am wrong, they will be 
gaseous bodies, as we assumed un- 
til now. It should be simple to 
select a few solar systems in this 
galaxy’s nucleus. If we find that 
the planets are gaseous, I will be 
shown wrong.” 

Amiro nodded to Klystro. 
“Well?” 

“It is hardly worth investigat- 
ing,” the survey captain said con- 
temptuously. 

“Is your survey completed?” 

“Very nearly.” 

“If you have no objection, then,” 



Amiro said, “I will instruct my 
guidance officer to prepare us chits 
to place us in this galaxy’s nucleus, 
so we may conduct the survey he 
suggests.” 

He waited then, but Klystro, 
glowering, said nothing. The ship- 
master turned to Fikret Griff. 
“Prepare the chits.” 

“Yes, Shipmaster,” Griff said. 
“Yes. And thank you, Shipmaster.” 

“And I hope you are right,” the 
shipmaster said. 

Griff went back to his quarters. 
He felt good. He knew he was 
right and the survey would prove 
it. 

But it was more than that : much 
more. He saw, opening out before 
the vision of his mind, a truly in- 
finite future for the human race. 

For there would always be new 
galaxies. Always . Even if every gal- 
axy were gutted by collisions, men 
would still have always a place 
to go. 

That was the big thing, the im- 
portant thing. Creation was end- 
less. And deathless. And ceaseless. 
And forever. 

And Man? Man’s fate? END

Nancy laughed and put her arms

With her head against Shandy’s

followed her back into the kitchen. 

Shandy looked at the album for 
a moment and then smiled. “I

“I knew I recognized you,” 
Nancy said, turning a third 
through the book. “My Uncle

thought, he does just repeat things

Setting the book beside the flow-

chance to talk to you before, ex- 
cept in a one-sided sort of way.” 
Shandy folded his hands and un- 
crossed his legs. “I don’t remember 
just now, Miss Nancy. I used to 
know. I don’t think there are many 
of us left now.” He touched his 
mustache again, smoothing it. 
“Maybe in the mountains there are 
some more. I don’t remember.” 
Nancy patted his head. “I’m go-

“You’ll enjoy that.” 

“You think you’ll stay this way?” 
Holman asked. 

“I might. I don’t know.” 
Holman held out his hand to 
Shandy. “Anyway, we want you to 
stay here and keep watch over 
things.” 

Shandy hesitated and then shook 
hands. “I might as well.” 

Holman and Nancy left for the 
settlement the next morning, with 
the suitcases. 

Shandy, still in the shape of

front steps of the ship. He waved 
goodbye to them. When they were

IN THE BALANCE 

Book Reviews by the Editor 



F THE TWENTY stories in 
Mid-Century , edited by Or- 
ville Prescott (Pocket Books, 35$), 
only four are fantasy in the general 
sense, and of these only one super- 
ficially resembles science fiction — 
“The Hour of Letdown,” by E. B. 
White. But it is a distinguished 
collection of contemporary short 
stories, and I thought it might be 
fruitful to inquire why there is no 
science fiction in it. 

The immediate answer is, of 
course, that Prescott didn’t like any 
s-f story well enough. But this is 
begging the question: it could have 
been predicted that he wouldn’t 
like any s-f story enough, because 
he is a respectable critic, and re- 
spectable critics don’t. 

What I wanted to know is: why 
not? What are the deficiencies in 
science fiction, or in its critics, that 
make it the forgotten child of 
American letters? 

A representative story from this 
collection, and a very good one, is 
John P. Marquand’s “Lunch At 



Honolulu.” The five main charac- 
ters, casually sketched in, are a job 
lot assembled by chance at one 
luncheon — an OWI man just ar- 
rived from the States, two senior 
naval officers, a brash young naval 
aviator, and the host, an oldtimer 
in the islands. 

The background, on the other 
hand, is assembled with care, and 
drips with local color. Even the 
dialogue is largely devoted to build- 
ing up background information; 
the host is a local patriot, with a 
hobbyist’s enthusiasm for anything 
Hawaiian, and a bore’s persistence: 
This is a lanai, not a verandah. 
Those are kukui trees. This is one- 
finger poi. And so on, inexhausti- 
bly. 

The admiral, his aide, and the 
OWI man react to this politely; 
the young aviator is rude. He hums 
under his breath. He interrupts, 
with brutal reminiscences about ac- 
tion he has seen. ( “ ‘Now this first 
one that hit us — ... he came in 
from the port side. We gave him 




107 



everything we had. You could see 
the 40s going into him like red-hot 
rivets. That kid must have been 
dead, but he still kept coming in. 
. It was a very rugged feeling. 5 55 ) 
And he drinks too much. 

After he leaves, the host apol- 
ogizes for him; but the admiral 
says: “‘Every now and then they 
act that way. You and I would, 
too. It’s only that boy was glad 
— and that’s natural — just glad he 
is still alive. 5 55 

That’s all there is to the story. 
At first it seems like an awful lot 
of setting for one small pearl. 
Then, as it sinks in, you realize 
that Marquand has used the story 
as a device to contain something 
much larger than itself — the whole 
great tragedy of the war in the 
Pacific. 

This is one of the standard tricks 
of the short story; when it’s well 
done it’s enormously effective; the 
sudden widening of view at the 
end seems to satisfy some human 
hunger. 

In this story, and in Shirley Jack- 
son’s “The Lottery,” and half a 
dozen others in the volume, the 
author uses careful, elaborate, evoc- 
ative detail of setting, to prepare 
you for a sudden illumination 
about people. 

The setting is made to seem in- 
teresting in itself, like the motions 
of a magician’s hand, only to dis- 
tract your attention and catch you 
off guard. 

Now this is something that s-f 
can do. “The Lottery,” “Cyclist’s 
Raid,” by Frank Rooney, and 
Shirley Ann Grau’s “The Black 
Prince” are allegorical fantasies, 



with obvious parallels in such s-f 
stories as Harry Bates’ “Farewell 
to the Master,” “The Yehudi 
Principle,” by Fredric Brown, and 
George Orwell’s “1984.” The best 
s-f stories frequently depend on 
just this effect — producing out of 
a needle’s eye something vast and 
altogether astonishing. 

Because Prescott chose the four 
fantasies (and wrote an appropri- 
ately loving introduction to the 
1952 edition of The Worm Ou - 
roboros ) , we know he is not one of 
those who think a story must be 
naturalistic to be taken seriously. 
Whatever his standards are, they 
are fine enough to admit fantasy 
and yet exclude science fiction. 

It might be an instructive ex- 
ercise to rewrite “Lunch At Hon- 
olulu” as science fiction: at least 
it would be remarkably easy to do. 
Where the text reads “koa” or 
“poi,” substitute some equally 
exotic but invented word; for 
“Japanese” substitute “Barsoomi- 
an,” or what have you ; for “battle- 
ship,” “spaceship,” and there you 
are. 

The resulting copy, if carefully 
written, would have all the values 
of the original : and yet you can see 
immediately that such a story 
would never wind up in a collec- 
tion like this one. 

Why not? Because the Marquand 
original has a real background, 
whereas the copy would have an 
invented one? 

Nonsense. Every writer gives his 
characters names as if they were 
real people, and calls his setting 
“Kentucky” or “Hollywood” as if 
it were a real place; but one is as 

108 




much invented as the- other. 

But let’s not quibble: is it be- 
cause a place called Honolulu does 
actually exist? 

So does a place called Mars. 

Then is it because a story about 
Honolulu has to be carefully re- 
searched, whereas you can say any- 
thing you like about Mars? 

Neither half of this plausible 
formulation happens to be true. 
There is so much readily available 
material about Honolulu, that any 
writer with an hour to spare could 
dig out of a guidebook all the facts 
Marquand used in his story. 

Information about Mars exists, 
but is scantier and harder to come 
by; to write a logically consistent 
story about Mars, taking into ac- 
count all that is known about the 
planet, is not the easiest job imagi- 
nable. 

Now, as far as the average reader 
is concerned, the trouble may well 
be one of a lack of confidence in 
the authors. The backwoods South- 
ern landscape of “The Black 
Prince” is as much a fantasy of 
Miss Grau’s as the things she 
makes happen in it; but never 
mind, the reader knows Miss Grau 
is a Southerner, so there must be 
some fact in the mixture. 

Even though the Kentucky of 
“Land of Our Enemies” is a moody 
charcoal drawing, all shadows and 
moonlight; even though the bar, in 
“The Hour of Letdown,” is like 
no New York bar the reader was 
ever in, never mind: Stuart is a 
Kentuckian and White a New 
Yorker. 

We have no Martian writers. 
Hence, probably, the exaggerated 



respect paid to s-f writers who are 
also working scientists, even though 
it almost always turns out that the 
biochemists write space opera, and 
the astronomers write biochemical 
fantasy. 

Where the critics are concerned, 
however, I have a hunch that the 
trouble is something more resem- 
bling a lack of self-confidence. By 
and large, our literary critics are 
not educated in science; they grew 
up in a tradition that has made a 
physicist as alien to them as a 
plumber. I think they are embar- 
rassed to find themselves un- 
equipped to distinguish accurate 
science fiction from twaddle. And 
I think most of them have fallen 
back on the assumption that if the 
traditional critical standards won’t 
fit it, it can’t be art. 

T HE DIFFICULTY of defining 
science fiction is that, like the 
Indian Ocean, it has no natural 
boundaries. There is a central area 
which everyone agrees is science 
fiction; then as you go farther out 
you meet disturbing similarities to 
other forms of fiction; and finally, 
at the edges, the most puzzling 
things happen. 

Take time travel, one of the 
staples of science fiction since H. G. 
Wells wrote The Time Machine 
in 1895. It accounts for perhaps 
one out of fifty science fiction 
stories, year in and year out; more 
in the case of some writers. In 1951. 
I was rash enough to express a 
belief that the time travel story 
was dying out; since then, eight 
of the thirty-six stories I’ve written 




have been time travel stories. 

Time travel has also been a 
staple device of the historical fic- 
tion writer, certainly since Rud- 
yard Kipling’s Puck of Pook’s Hill 
(1906), and perhaps earlier. Two 
recent examples are delightfully 
hard to classify: Pawn of Time , by 
Robin Carson (Holt, $4.95) and 
Curtain of Mist , by M. Pardoe 
(Funk & Wagnalls, $2.95). 

Paivn of Time is a big, sprawl- 
ing, robust novel about a young 
New Yorker with the improbable 
name of Heitman Urban, who gets 
himself back into Renaissance Italy 
by the crudest sort of parlor hocus- 
pocus: “ ‘Simple,’ the Pernod 

drinker told him. ‘Concentrate on 
Venice in that period. Then clear 
the mind of every thought and 
image for about three minutes. 
Let the mind go blank, and then 

J 5) 

And then Urban finds himself 
in Venice, in his own physical 
body, but wearing Renaissance 
clothes, and carrying a whacking 
big pouch of gold. Carson’s ex- 
planation: “He thought he knew 
why he was in possession of a 
fortune. It represented the mecha- 
nized and collective services of his 
own age, which had been ex- 
changed for the all-embracing 
commodity of money.” 

Swallow this, and the rest fol- 
lows with logic enough, and with 
such vividness and good-humored 
impudence that you would for- 
give greater offenses. Carson ob- 
viously loves his period, and he 
makes it come alive — 16th century 
Venice and Rome, full of Spanish 
adventurers talking about their 



cojonesy virtuous whores and avail- 
able nuns, filth and velvet, piety, 
pillage and manslaughter. 

Carson is a Swede, and writes 
with occasional unidiomatic awk- 
wardness (the first sixty pages or 
so are full of blunders like “to 
ignore that” and “to really lose 
grip”; later they almost disappear, 
as if the author had perfected his 
English while writing this book). 
He is also a master of the telling 
phrase: “and the blood shot out 
like a black arm over the stones.” 

Urban (who, not unpredictably, 
turns out to be an accomplished 
fencer) saves a young Spaniard, 
Don Manuel Ordonez de Talavera, 
from armed attack; acquires a new 
name, and spins a wonderful C. 
S. Lewisish tale to account for his 
ignorance of local events and per- 
sonages: reared among the savage 
New World Indians by his mother 
(who taught’ him all the niceties of 
civilized conduct), he floated across 
to Europe on a tree. His hosts in- 
nocently take all this for gospel, 
and in fact the head of the house- 
hold, Don Isidro de Bahamonte 
Mendoza y de Beltran, puts a sec- 
retary to work at writing it down 
as an edifying chronicle: The 

Marvelous Life and Astonishing 
Adventures of the Most Excellent 
Sehor and Very Magnificent Cava- 
lier Don Jaiman Urban de Bique- 
man; How by Unwavering Faith 
and with God's Help He Escaped 
from the Land of the Heathen; 
With Special Maps and Explana- 
tions by the Author. (“ ‘I think we 
have hit on a very snappy title/ 
said Urban.”) 

The one really curious thing 



110 




about Urban is that he has no 
past history of his own ; beyond 
the fact that he lived on Beekman 
Place in New York, the author 
tells us nothing about him; and 
he is described so sparsely that it 
isn’t until nearly halfway through 
the book that we can even form 
any clear idea of what he looks 
like. 

In contrast, all the other charac- 
ters are drawn with loving clarity 
and precision. Nearly all of them 
are rogues of one degree or an- 
other, and the more rascally they 
are, the better the author makes 
us like them. 

What makes the book so absorb- 
ing to read is the author’s seem- 
ingly deep and genuine love for 
the people of the period — not the 
great personages, who do not ap- 
pear; but the ordinary, everyday 
men and women of the Renais- 
sance. 

Now Urban, being a time travel- 
er, has the virtues of both an ob- 
server and a participant. He is 
immersed in the story, but sees 
it freshly. To this extent, the time 
traveling element may be con- 
sidered a purely formal device ; but 
Carson has also made use of it in 
several unexpected ways for its own 
sake, with uneven success. 

The broad theme of the book is 
that of Urban’s slow cultural as- 
similation, until at the end he is 
completely a man of the time. The 
last vestige of his attachment to 
the 20th century takes the curious 
(and plausible) form of a dress fe- 
tishism, practiced with one of his 
mistress’s servant girls. In quirky 
episodes like this one, Carson plays 



the two cultures off against each 
other with brilliant effect; but his 
tentative efforts to use the time- 
traveling element in a more science- 
fictional way are clumsy and weak. 

The purchasing-power- to-gold 

transformation, already mentioned, 
is one example; another is Urban’s 
six-year pursuit of gold, under the 
persuasion that he has to earn as 
much as he came with, before he 
can go back. Again, the minor 
character who turns out to be an- 
other time-traveler is implausible 
throughout; this is in striking con- 
trast to the strength of the other 
minor characters. 

Although Carson has Urban in- 
troduce modem fencing a hundred 
years early, it doesn’t seem to occur 
to him to wonder what changes in 
the history of modern Europe and 
America this would inevitably 
cause. Finally, the metaphysical 
surprise with which he ends his 
story is a pure opportunism, a 
shocker without any structural link 
to the rest of the book. 

Let me add at once that these 
defects, which would no doubt be 
fatal in a pure science fiction story, 
are unimportant flaws here : the 
book is coherent, vital and satisfy- 
ing, with all its imperfections, from 
one end to the other. 

Curtain of Mist is an uncommon- 
ly good juvenile, about four 20th- 
century people set down in pre- 
Roman Britain. Like Carson, Miss 
Pardoe evidently knows and loves 
her subject; and like his, her nar- 
rative is written in a forthright, 
no-nonsense style. (As a rule, it’s 
the author trying to cover up his 
ignorance who writes with stuffy 




erudition.) Here again, there is 
no attempt to provide a scientific 
rationale for the time- travel ex- 
perience : in spite of some talk 
about Dunne’s An Experiment 
With Time (listed in the bibli- 
ography, along with twenty-odd 
scholarly works on ancient history 
and archaeology), it’s Polynesian 
magic that gets the four travelers 
into the past at the beginning of 
the story, and Celtic magic that 
returns them at the end. Now, 
clearly, this is nothing more than a 
convenient trick to get two other- 
wise incompatible things together 
— the modern protagonists, and 
the ancient setting. The time- 
traveling experience itself is not of 
the essence; Miss Pardoe has used 
it to get to the real heart of her 
story, just as Selma Lagerlof used 
the device of a miniature boy who 
traveled with the wild geese and 
spoke their language, to write a 
kind of story-geography of Sweden. 

But authors’ intentions often go 
astray. H. G. Wells was under the 
impression that in The Food of 
the Gods he had written an allegory 
of changing transportation systems 
in Britain, and he was quite put 
out that no one got the point. 
Authors’ intentions aside, The 
Food of the Gods is a science fiction 
novel in which the good story-tell- 
ing entirely overshadows the bad 
allegory; and The Wonderful Ad- 
ventures of Nils is surely more 
fantasy than geography. 

At any rate, Curtain of Mist is 
mostly an historical novel, but the 
elements of fantasy in it, even of 
science fiction — for instance, the 
very careful use of telepathy to get 



over the translation problem — 
make it impossible to exclude it 
from the field altogether. 

To meet the ancient Celts, some 
in their “wheelhouses” and brochs, 
some in Romanized villas with 
central heating — not just blue- 
painted savages, but people with a 
high culture of their own — is a 
fascinating experience in this novel. 
What’s the difference between that 
and reading a story about an im- 
aginary barbaric culture in the fu- 
ture, or on another planet? Tech- 
nical differences there certainly 
are, but the pleasure, it seems to 
me, is exactly the same. 



B ALLANTINE has been pub- 
licizing John Wyndham’s The 
Midwich Cuckoos ($3.50), for 
reasons I cannot fathom, as a comic 
novel. Certainly the plot sounds 
comic enough. Something like a 
flying saucer descends on a sleepy 
English village; there is a 24-hour 
blackout during which nobody 
from outside can get in, and the 
inhabitants slumber; and a few 
months later it becomes evident 
that every fertile woman in the 
village is pregnant. 

In the hands of a French writer, 
like the author of The Scandals 
of Clochemerle, I suppose this 
idea might actually have turned 
out to be funny; but Wyndham is 
nothing if not English, and his 
treatment is deadly serious, and 
I’m sorry to say, deadly dull. 

The book opens promisingly, 
with a phlegmatic parade of Brit- 
ons imperturbably vanishing into 
Midwich, and other Britons being 




sent to hunt for them. There are 
glimmers of humor later on, as 
when a character refers to “the 
Obstetrics Division of Military In- 
telligence.” But about page 90 the 
story begins to bog down under 
layers of polite restraint, sentimen- 
tality, lethargy and women’s-maga- 
zine masochism, and it never lifts 
its head long again. 

To begin with, the narrator is 
purely an observer; he continually 
gets in the way of the story, with- 
out contributing anything of his 
own. The central events of the 
story, partly for this reason, never 
emerge. The golden-eyed, hypnotic 
super-children grow up to a nasty 
teenhood and are then bombed to 
bits by a patriotic villager, which 
is just about what you would ex- 
pect to happen. (In 247 pages, the 
book reaches the point at which 
van Vogt’s Sian begins.) 

Who the “cuckoos” in the fly- 
ing saucer were, and what the hell 
they thought they were up to, we 
never learn. Presumably the author 
was at a loss, too. 

Wyndham’s unbearably leisure- 
ly preparation consumes 145 pages 
before we get our first first-hand 
glimpse of a super-child; we do 
not hear one speak more than a 
couple of syllables until page 210, 
and the effect then is one of fraud 
— .it’s too late to* convince us now 
that they can talk like anyone else. 

In Wyndham’s Out of the Sea , 
this same kind of arm’s-length 
treatment was highly effective, be- 
cause in that one, the invaders were 
at the bottom of the ocean, and 
we could only speculate about 
them. But in The Midwich Cuck- 



oos, the children are here; to keep 
them always half a mile in the 
background, as Wyndham does, is 
indefensible. 

Vanguard to Venus, by Jeffery 
Lloyd Castle (Dodd, Mead, $3.00) 
is another astonishing combination 
of brilliance and foolishness by the 
author of Satellite E One. 

The brilliance: a circumstantial 
description of the departure of the 
first Venus ship, which for vivid 
imagery and plausibility ranks 
with anything done in the field. 

The foolishness: Venerians, or, 
if you like, Venusians (Castle, 
alone in the entire world, calls 
them “Venutians”) descended from 
a space shipload of ancient Egyp- 
tians, and practicing black magic 
along with nuclear physics. 

The “Venutian” part of the 
story is nonsense, and thirty-year- 
old nonsense at that; but Castle’s 
handling of space travel is not only 
technically admirable, it is lyrical 
too. Here is a man who if he chose, 
and if he would get a few maggots 
out of his head, could write the 
Mob y Dick of space-flight: 

Less than a mile away the Satel- 
lite itself, permanent-seeming as 
the Moon, revolved about its cen- 
tral tower with majestic and un- 
varying smoothness, a mighty ring 
of gold suspended in space, half 
floodlit in the Sun’s strange unre- 
fracted light, half deeply shadowed 
and invisible against the equal 
black of the sky. Like those gro- 
tesque processions of saints that 
sometimes mark the striking of 
cathedral clocks, the assorted masts 
and antennae, telescopes and scan- 



113 




ners, marched round and round 
eternally, from light to darkness 
and from darkness into light. 

The Joy Wagon, by Arthur T. 
Hadley (Viking, $3.50) is a farci- 
cal novel about a political cam- 
paign. It gets enormous mileage 
out of one simple but blood-chill- 
ing device: substituting for the 

human candidate a Machiavellian 
computer named Microvac — and 
as far as possible, letting the plot 
proceed exactly as if he were hu- 
man. 

The first twenty pages of the 
book, for some odd reason, are 
written in primer-sized sentences, 
and as awkwardly put together as 
possible — a line of wooden dia- 
logue, then a paragraph of back- 
ground material, then another line 
of dialogue, like a man trying to 
start a balky Model T. On page 21, 
the engine catches when Hadley 
turns to the unorthodox love prob- 
lems of a young university professor 
and a night telephone operator. 
(“The room could be locked from 
the inside, but there were only two 
small swivel chairs with upright 
backs. Interruptions from the 
board, though infrequent, were of 
a disturbingly random pattern. Kay, 
hinting at some past experience, 
was nervous about cleaning men 
with pass keys . .”) And away 
we go. Hadley, who went through 
the 1956 Presidential campaign as 
a member of Stevenson’s staff, has 
met all the gorgeously varied fauna 
of a Presidential year — and here 
they are: Bryant W. Dangle, the 
egghead candidate, “who never 
split an infinitive or joined an 



issue”; Congressman Bates Hew- 
ball, “the sheep’s friend”; mad 
Nora Claggett (“In her hands she 
bore a nine-foot pole from whose 
top fluttered a gigantic green and 
blue pennant with a gold radio 
tube on it. Beneath the tube were 
embroidered in scarlet the words, 
‘Prepare for Doom.’”); TV 
camera crews everywhere (Two 
heaving roustabouts were snaking 
a heavy cable across the room. 
They flipped it over a line of chairs, 
fetching the ladies in the next row 
an oily smack. ‘Hands off dat 
cable!’ they yelled crossly.”) ; In- 
dians ( “ ‘See, Microvac got no 
head. All world know machine got 
no head. You give bonnet to ma- 
chine that got no head, you look 
silly to whole world, Chief.’”); 
hustlers, advance men, managers, 
and above all, Mike itself. 

Mike is a political manager’s 
dream. It works tirelessly, knows 
all the answers, has a dynamic 
handshake (engineered with “deli- 
cate electronic pads” in its hands), 
never loses its temper, never makes 
the same mistake twice. As thou- 
sands cheer, you cheer, too: the 
best part of the joke is that you 
find yourself wanting Microvac to 
win, because it’s a more likable 
guy, a greater American, a more 
forceful and intelligent leader 
than either of the two regular 
candidates. It ought to win, too, 
if logic means anything: instead, 
the book ends with a last-minute 
disaster which is clumsily contrived 
and abrupt; if, as I half suspect, 
this “happy” ending was forced on 
Hadley by an editor, the latter 
ought to be shot.

’ IF" anyone asks when science 
fiction, as a literary form, is going 
to attain maturity, I shall refer 
them to Frank Riley’s A Question 
of Identity (April ’58). Of course, 
craftsmanship and precision of de- 
tail make it a smooth-flowing, sus- 
penseful yarn, but standing proud 
and tall in front of all other such 
considerations is the concept 
around which the story technicali- 
ties form the body substance. 

It takes skill to treat dignified 
subjects in a dignified way. Too 
many of us take the easy way out, 
and hide behind the ubiquitous 
“light touch” when we have some- 
thing serious to say. All well and 
good, the light touch is a fine thing, 
but I wonder how often it is used 
as a shield for embarrassment at 
having something significant to say 
and no decent way to say it. Frank 
Riley has shown us that he can 
say something decent without em- 
barrassment.

A “Bravo” and also a “Tch-tch” 
to the housewife who authored the 



last letter in your April issue letter 
dept. I’ll bet that every sci-fi fan 
agrees with most of her letter, but 
bristles at the last part when she 
says she has to defend it when 
caught reading science fiction. 

“Defend it!” — she should be 
proud she can appreciate it! Most 
adults feel contemptuous of those 
who read “scandal, and/or love” 
type publications (and Nothing 
Else). One of the best ways to 
turn a scoffer into a “fan” is to 
loan him a few pre-selected books 
or magazines — it has never failed 
me yet in producing converts, but 
is a wee bit hard on the library — 
mine is practically a “circulating” 
library — but then I always seem 
to find a story which will really 
interest the doubter — possibly be- 
cause I belong to a book-club of 
science-fiction editions, and also 
buy every magazine on the market. 

By the way — there’s only one 
thing wrong with IF — I can’t put 
it down until I’ve read it cover to 
cover and am disappointed that 
there isn’t just one more story!

First, some statistics for your 
survey: I am 24, married, no chil- 
dren, and am an IBM operator of 
five years’ standing. Have been 
reading science fiction since 1950, 
and have managed to collect since 
that time some 4,000 science fiction 
books and magazines — and I’m just 
beginning! So much for the statis- 
tics. 

Now I have a most vehement 
and violent complaint against your 
change of type for the “IF” on the 
cover and contents page. I don’t 
like it! The old one was stylish, 
distinctive, and very pleasant to 
look at. But this new monstrosity 
is coarse, formless, and utterly un- 
distinguished. It doesn’t say any- 
thing, it's just— there. Very char- 
acterless. Please change back to the 
old style. I also think it was better 
when you had “World of” above 
the “IF,” in the little square. It 
gave your magazine a very dis- 
tinctive personality. How about it? 

I like your stories in general, 
though I notice a slight similarity 
in some of them, as if it were the 
same theme being treated slightly 
differently. But still, it ranks in the 
top few, and is usually well worth 
reading. 

In conclusion, keep up the good 
work — but please change that “IF”, 
it doesn’t become you!

1 am 24, B.A.Sc. in Chemical 
Engineering from University of 
Toronto, married. I have been 
reading science fiction since 1940. 
Currently I have to be extremely 
selective with regard to my read- 



ing matter, because of limited time. 
I read practically nothing else but 
ASF and occasional stories by my 
favorite authors (Asimov, Heinlein, 
Clement, and an assortment of 
lesser names) published elsewhere. 

So much for statistics for your 
survey. 

In spite of what I have stated 
above, I have always held IF to 
be one of the four best science 
fiction magazines. If I have 
neglected it recently, it is only be- 
cause of time demands. As your 
former steady and currently oc- 
casional reader, I want to protest 
most vehemently against the atroci- 
ty wrought upon the appearance 
of the cover of your magazine. I 
don’t know whose idea it was to 
change the cover to its present 
design, but only a soap commercial 
writer could have conceived it. 
From a distinctive and elegant 
design, you have changed to a com- 
mon, hackneyed, utterly uninspired 
one. There is nothing now to dis- 
tinguish your magazine from a 
dozen others with similar covers. 

Furthermore, while the present 
nearly square format of the color 
illustration on the cover no doubt 
costs considerably less than a full 
page illo, I would like to see IF 
return to the original full page 
color cover if at all possible. I 
would also like to point out here, 
that magazines with predominant- 
ly monochromatic covers have a 
much greater eye appeal than the 
ones whose covers are a jumble of 
colors light and dark. Especially 
predominantly black or predomi- 
nantly white covers with a simple

trast are most eyecatching. You 
might consider these points in 
choosing your illos and your cover 
design. Another point: I would 

like to see the lettering on the 
cover kept to a bare minimum, and 
placed in an unobtrusive place. 
In addition, each illustration should 
be purposely designed to form a 
balanced whole with the lettering, 
something that is seldom seen on 
the covers of s-f magazines these 
days. Some of your covers, I notice, 
are guilty in this respect too, e.g. 
the February issue.

prefers the new logotype please 
speak up, and balance the equa-

I had to write and tell you how 
much I enjoyed reading Arthur C. 
Clarke’s The Songs of Distant 
Earth. This is definitely the best 
science fiction story I have read in 
years. What I particularly liked 
about the story was the way the 
author made everything seem real 
and somehow ordinary, at the same 
time that it was all wonderful and 
strange. I don’t know if I am ex- 
pressing this right, but it seems to 
me that most writers don’t know 
how to do this. Either they are al- 
ways oh-ing and ah-ing over how 
wonderful their inventions, etc., are, 
or else they take everything for 
granted so that the reader is bored 
before he starts. 

I think people will go on living 
their ordinary day to day lives in 
the future, but that doesn’t mean 



they will lose their sense of won- 
der. The two things have to go to- 
gether, it seems, or else the story 
just is not believable. This is a pet 
gripe of mine, so I wanted to let 
you know you hit me just right with 
The Songs of Distant Earth. More! 

— Robert W. Grundy 
North Bend, Washington 

I have been a reader of science 
fiction for over twenty years, but 
this is the first time I have ever writ- 
ten a letter to a magazine. By pro- 
fession I am an Electrical Engineer, 
and enjoy reading science fiction 
for mental stimulation, even though 
the stories are frequently implausi- 
ble. 

The reason I am writing now is 
because my attention was caught by 
the method Arthur C. Clarke used, 
in his story The Songs of Distant 
Earth , for insulating the interstellar 
space ship from the heat released 
by contact with interstellar dust, 
etc. This certainly is a spectacular 
idea, carrying an iceberg a mile 
ahead of the space ship to act as a 
“bumper.” But let’s see how it 
would work out. 

To start with, we will take the 
case of the space ship moving at a 
comparatively modest speed — one 
thousand miles a second, or 1600 
km. /sec. This sounds like a lot, but 
is actually quite slow as cosmic 
speeds go. Now the mass of the ice- 
berg “bumper,” Clarke tells us, is 
about 1,000,000 tons. Converting 
this into metric tons for conven- 
ience, we have 907,441 m. tons. We 
don’t know what shape the “bump- 
er” is, but again for convenience 
will suppose it is a cube, about 97 



117 




meters on a side. (This gives a vol- 
ume of 912,673,000,000 c.c.’s, which 
is pretty close.) As the space ship 
travels in a forward direction, the 
leading face of the cube, with an 
area of 94,090,000 square centi- 
meters, will be contacting whatever 
cosmic dust is in the way (mostly 
hydrogen). Taking the distribution 
of hydrogen atoms in interstellar 
space at about one per c.c., we find 
that the “bumper” will be hitting 
some 15,040,000,000,000,000 (fif- 
teen quadrillion, forty trillion) 
atoms every second. The combined 
mass, at rest, of these atoms, will be 
in the neighborhood of .00000046 
grams. Figuring for kinetic energy, 
which equals one-half the mass 
times the velocity squared, we get 
the respectable sum of 5,888,000,- 
000 ergs. 

Now the amount of energy need- 
ed to raise one gram of water one 
degree G. is one joule, or 10,000,- 
000 ergs. In other words, to raise 
the whole mass of ice one degree G. 
would require roughly 900,000,000,- 
000 times 10,000,000 or 9,000,000,- 
000,000,000,000 (nine quintillion) 
ergs. Dividing this by our figure of 
5,888,000,000, we find that 1,500,- 
000,000 seconds — about 4,800 years 
— would be required to raise the 
mass of ice one degree C. (This is 
simplifying, of course; in actuality, 
the ice molecules would be heated 
to vapor point and would boil off 
into space along the leading face of 
the cube, gradually reducing its 
depth; however, this method gives 
us a good approximation of the 
problem.) 

So we see that at these moderate 
speeds, the “bumper” would work 



nicely. 

But now let’s examine the case of 
the space ship moving at speeds 
near the speed of light — which is 
what Clarke’s space ship does. That 
is a different case altogether. 

According to relativity theory, 
mass becomes infinite as velocity ap- 
proaches the speed of light. Sup- 
pose we assume the space ship is 
traveling at nine-tenths c y or about 
27,000,000,000 cm./sec. This is 
really moving! And I want to know 
how Clarke propels such a mass, 
but that is a different problem. 

At this speed, the leading face of 
the ice “bumper” would be con- 
tacting on the order of 2,000,000,- 
000,000,000,000 (two quintillion) 
hydrogen atoms every second. The 
“rest mass” of these atoms would 
be about .00006 grams : but their 
mass with reference to the moving 
space ship would be 37 grams! And 
the kinetic energy released by con- 
tact with the “bumper” works out 
to the astonishing figure of 33,000,- 
000,000,000,000,000,000 ( thirty- 

three sextillion!) ergs per second. 
That would be enough to blow the 
“bumper” to hell and gone in less 
than one-tenth of a second — and 
spread it around over a lot of inter- 
stellar space too! 

The oddest thing of all when you 
come to look at it is that this 
“bumper” of Mr. Clarke’s seems to 
be held in place by some kind of 
force beam or “gravity field,” such 
as was used to raise it from the 
planet Thalassa. Now if you have 
a convenient thing like that, why 
use a “bumper” at all? Presumably 
the field would be propagated at 
the speed of light, and so it could 

8 




push the H atoms out of the road 
quick enough for the space ship to 
get by. 

Anyhow, I enjoyed the story!

I am 22 years old, a housewife 
and the mother of a 10 month old 
girl who leaves me breathless from 
her constant bounce. I was a chem- 
istry major in college and worked 
for a year at an airplane plant in 
the design department. Both of 
these heightened my enjoyment of 
science fiction, but I have been 
reading it since I was 10. I’ll al- 
ways be grateful to the druggist 
who ignored the plump little girl 
eagerly devouring his magazines 
while picking at her sandwich so 
it would last a long time. I read 
each copy from cover to cover, 
week after week between my flute 
and piano lessons every Saturday. 
Since I arranged for a two-hour 
lunch period and because I was a 
very fast reader, I had no trouble 
finishing several a week. Occasion- 
ally I brought one home, but the 
lurid covers brought down my fa- 
ther’s wrath. He still doesn’t ap- 
preciate this type of literature, but 
restricts himself to an occasional 
headshake. 

My husband fortunately shares 
this enthusiasm for s-f. I had saved 
my copies from ’50 on, and he had 
a field day catching up. This left 
me twiddling my thumbs several 
times during our dating days, but 
I think now it was worth every 
minute. Now we sit and read maga- 
zines together and this cozy scene 
is broken only by a chuckle or some 



other approving or disappointed 
monosyllable and an occasional 
“Hey, did you read this one? If 
you’re done, I’ll trade.” We find 
ourselves discussing stories we es- 
pecially enjoyed months later. This 
has been handicapped somewhat 
for the last five months since he is 
working in an isolated spot in 
Alaska as a communications tech- 
nician. We expect to be reading If 
and all our other favorites together 
again in September. 

Arthur G. Clarke is one of my 
two favorite authors, Isaac Asimov 
being the other.

Imagine Yourclfttmglraled 
Into The 2rCenfury 




...AND WAKING UP 30 YEARS YOUNGER 
THAN YOUR SWttTHtARTI 



J UST put yourself in Daniel Davis’ 
place. It's the year 1970. You’re a 
young engineer, about to sell a million- 
dollar invention. You’re sitting pretty— 
until your passionate friend, Belle Dar- 
kin, upsets your apple cart. First she 
steals your invention. Then she slips you 
a hypo; puts you in a new kind of deep 
freeze called “The Long Sleep.” 

You wake up SO YEARS LATER , in 
the year 2000-and you’re still only 29 
years old! But time has passed 
while you were in “cold storage,” 
and Belle, your e#-sweetheart, is 
now 30 years older than you are ! 

Well, you’ve lost interest in her 
anyway, after the way she two- 
timed and future-timed you. 

The Fascinating World of 2000 A,D . 

But there are other attractions 
in that world of 2000 : its women 
in “sticktite” clothes they just 
throw away after wearing ... its 
honeymoon trips to the moon... 
its remarkable new conveniences 
...its brand new words of love 
and ways to live. No more menial 
labor. Robots take care of all that. 

Soon you’re enjoying life as never 
before! You’re glad to be out of 
that miserably backward world 
of the 20th century. 

But unfortunately you must get 
back to the year 1970, to take 
care of one last urgent mission. 

You only hope that you can come 
back to the 21st century by tak- 
ing “The Long Sleep” again. The 
big question is: Can it be done?
