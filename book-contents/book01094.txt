DRAMATIS 

O NE OF the good things about 
being a science-fiction editor 
is that you get to meet an outsize 
share of the most argumentative, 
most individualistic and most per- 
sonally rewarding humans alive: 
i.e., the science-fiction writers. 
There aren’t very many of them. 
Perhaps there are two or three 
hundred in the world, at least on 
this side of the Iron Curtain.

PERSONAE 

(We are told that there are at 
least ninety full-time sf writers 
in the U.S.S.R.; but none of them 
has as yet elected to offer his 
work to Galaxy.) 

What these men and women 
lack in numbers they make up in 
articulation. We recently had the 
pleasure of participating in a 
panel discussion sponsored by 
Playboy, in which we endeavored 



4 



GALAXY 



to make ourselves heard in a con- 
gregation comprising Theodore 
Sturgeon, Poul Anderson, Robert 
A. Heinlein, William Tenn, Algis 
Budrys and Arthur C. Clarke. 
Playboy had the idea its readers 
would relish listening in on a 
tape-recorded bull session of 
these mighty minds, talking the 
shop-talk of their trade: What’s 
next for the world? In its inno- 
cence Playboy provided a satchel 
full of tape on which to engrave 
the conversation that ensued; but 
when the talk stopped after four 
hours it was not because the sci- 
ence-fictionists had run out of 
conversation. Playboy had run 
out of tape. 

Science-fiction writers come in 
all shapes and sizes. Rich man, 
poor man, beggar man, th — no, 
pass that one; doctor, lawyer . 
again no. We cannot think of 
either felon or Indian chief who 
writes science fiction, but almost 
every other occupation has its 
representatives in the ranks, from 
sober university professor (ret.) 
to short-order cook in a ham- 
burger joint (also ret.) A doctor 
and a lawyer, come to think of 
it, are represented in the current 
issue. 

r | ’he good doctor is J. F. Bone. 

If he chances to be a D.V.M. 
instead of an M.D., why, so much 
the better for the Pacific North- 
west’s livestock, and so much the 



worse for its human sufferers. 
One of our best-preserved memo- 
ries of a Seattle visit a couple of 
years ago is of Jesse Bone ex- 
plaining some medical complexi- 
ties to a roomful of people, about 
half of whom were practicing 
M.D.s It may well be that a prac- 
tice comprising everything from 
toads to Angus bulls may lead 
to contemplative ways of thought 
on the part of the practicioner; 
and thus from a consideration of 
the manifold blueprints by which 
our Earthly vertebrates are con- 
structed to a guess at how Mar- 
tian livestock may be put to- 
gether ... as in On the Fourth 
Planet. 

The lawyer, then? Why, that 
is Theodore L. Thomas. Here’s 
a fellow with a flourishing patent 
practice in a big Eastern state. 
That’s his profession. For a 
hobby, he works at skin-diving; 
was one of the pioneers in the 
sport and has crept along the bot- 
tom of every body of water with- 
in range of his station wagon. In 
what category he places his sci- 
ence-fiction writing we cannot 
guess. The fact is that he writes 
a good deal of it, though, and he 
writes it very well. There was 
his The Watery Wonders of Cap- 
tain Nemo (which we were lucky 
enough to publish in Galaxy ) for 
one example; for another, there 
was his The Weather Man 
(which we weren’t.) 



DRAMATIC PERSONAE 



5 



Frankly, this sort of behavior 
surprises us. We have long cher- 
ished a theory that lawyers are 
tone-deaf to style. It’s against all 
their training, you see. A writer’s 
job is to evoke images and sug- 
gest moods; a lawyer’s is to nail 
down slippery facts, not merely 
so firmly that no one can mis- 
understand, but in such petti- 
fogging detail that not even a 
contumacious imbecile can pre- 
tend he misunderstands. All those 
painfully detailed stipulations, 
that lumbering contractese that 
mumbles its way through thickets 
of and/ors and bogs of herein- 
afters: these are the death of art. 
A lawyer is permitted to imply 
nothing and to evoke nothing. He 
has to put the whole business in 
dull black and arid white. 

Yet strangely we find that here 
a lawyer can throw off his occu- 
pational disease; for no one with 
a tin ear could have written The 
Lonely Man. Then there is Da- 
mon Knight, for whom a dozen 
pages like this one could hardly 
do justice. 

Damon Knight is that rather 
rare specimen, the science-fiction 
writer who makes that his princi- 
pal occupation. Of course, it is not 
always stories that he writes. His 
critical anthology, A Century of 
Science Fiction, is the closest 
thing to a handbook of the field 
that anyone has yet produced; 
and as a book reviewer, Knight 



has at least two distinctions — the 
only critic to be given an award 
for his work, and the only critic 
to have had his opinions gathered 
into book form. Both distinctions 
are well earned. 

Yet if we had to choose be- 
tween Knight the editor-critic 
and Knight the writer we would 
have no hesitation. Good as his 
first avatar is, it is as a writer that 
he triumphs. Everybody knows 
Damon Knight’s biting short 
stories — Not with a Bang, To 
Serve Man — and his brilliant 
novelettes, What Rough Beast 
and Cabin Boy ... to name only 
a pair of each out of dozens. 
Damon Knight’s great lack as a 
fiction writer has been in the 
novel; there haven’t been enough 
of them. But he is beginning to 
repair that deficiency. In the 
present issue we have the longest 
story he has ever had in Galaxy 
. and, we think, his best. It is 
called The Visitor at the Zoo. 

A nd we haven’t even mentioned 
that stocky and formidably 
talented Californian, Kris Neville, 
nor Magnus Ludens, who turns 
up at odd times, from odd parts 
of the world, with odd stories. An 
interesting and rewarding lot, 
science-fiction writers. We’re glad 
to know them. And we’re glad 
to be able to go on presenting 
the best part of them — their 
stories — to you. — THE EDITOR

GALAXY 




THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

THE VISITOR AT 

THE ZOO 




by Damon Knight 



A S THE Flugbahn car began 
to slide away from the land- 
ing platform, the biped Fritz 
clutched the arms of his seat and 
looked nervously down through 
the transparent wall. 

He was unused to travel. Ex- 
cept for the trip by spaceship to 
Earth, which he hardly remem- 
bered, he had lived all his life in 
the Hamburg Zoo. Now — al- 
though he was sure the sus- 
pended car would not fall — be- 
ing so high, and surrounded by 
nothing but glass, made him 
want to grip something for se- 
curity. 

In the seat beside him, his 
keeper, a stupid man named 
Alleks, was unfolding the crisp 
parchment sheets of the Berliner

GALAXY 



The biped's home was eighteen light 
years away — in space — but remoter 
still in the distances of the mind!

Zeitung. The breath whistled in 
his hairy nostrils as he gazed 
cow-eyed at the headlines. Down 
the aisle, the other passengers 
were all staring at Fritz, but be- 
ing used to this, the biped hardly 
noticed it. 

Below, Berlin was spread out 
in the morning sun like a richly 
faded quilt. Looking back, as the 
car began to fall with increasing 
speed, Fritz could see the high 
platform where the Hamburg 
rocket-copter had landed, and 
the long spidery cables of the 
other Flugbahnen radiating out- 
ward to the four quarters of the 
city. 

The car swooped, rose, checked 
at a station platform. The doors 
opened and closed again, then

they were falling once more. At 
the second stop, Alleks folded his 
paper and got up. “Come,” he 
said. 

Fritz followed him onto the 
platform, then into an elevator 
that dropped, in a dizzying fash- 
ion, through a transparent spiral 
tube, down, down and down, 
while the sunlit streets flowed 
massively upward. They got off 
into a bewildering crowd and a 
sharp chemical odor. Alleks, with 
a firm grip on the biped’s arm, 
propelled him down the street, 
through a tall open doorway, 
then into another elevator and 
finally into an office full of peo- 
ple. 

“My dear young sir,” said a 
red-faced fat man, advancing 
jovially, “come in, come in. Al- 
low me to introduce myself, I am 
Herr Doktor Griick. And you are 
our new biped? Welcome, wel- 
come!” He took the biped’s three- 
fingered hand and shook it warm- 
ly, showing no distaste at the 
fact that it was covered with soft, 
feathery-feeling spines. 

Other people were crowding 
around, some aiming cameras. 
“Sign,” said Alleks, holding out 
a dog-eared notebook. 

Dr. Griick took the notebook 
absently, scribbled, handed it 
back. Alleks turned indifferently 
and was gone. “Gentlemen and 
ladies,” said Griick in a rich 
tenor, “I have the honor to intro- 



duce to you our newest acquisi- 
tion, Fritz — our second Brecht 
Biped — and you see that he is 
a male!” 

The biped darted nervous 
glances around the oak-paneled 
room, at the whirring cameras, 
the bookshelves, the massive 
chandelier, the people with their 
naked pink faces. His body was 
slight and supple, like that of a 
cat or a rooster. The grayish- 
green, cactus-like spines covered 
him all over, except for the pink- 
ish sacs that swung between his 
thighs. His odd-shaped head was 
neither human, feline nor avian, 
but something like all three. 
Above the eyes, in the middle of 
his wide sloping forehead, was a 
round wrinkled organ of a dusty 
red-purple color, vaguely sugges- 
tive of a cock’s comb, in shape 
more like a withered fruit. 

“A word for the newscast!” 
called some of the people with 
cameras. 

/"kBEDIENTLY, as he had been 
taught, the biped recited, 
“How do you do, gentlemen and 
ladies? Fritz, the biped, at your 
service. I am happy to be here 
and I hope you will come to see 
me often at the Berlin Zoo.” He 
finished with a little bow. 

Three white-smocked men 
stepped forward; the first bowed, 
took the biped’s hand. “Wenzl, 
Head Keeper.” He was bony and 



10 



GALAXY 



pale, with a thin straight mouth. 
The next man advanced, bowed, 
shook hands. “Rausch, Dietitian.” 
He was blonder and ruddier than 
Griick, with eyelashes almost 
white in a round, serious face. 
The third: “Prinzmetal, our vet- 
erinary surgeon.” He was dark 
and had sunken cheeks. 

Dr. Griick beamed, his red 
face as stretched and shiny as 
if cooked in oil. His round 
skull was almost bald, but the 
blond hair, cut rather long, still 
curled crisply above his ears. His 
little blue eyes gleamed behind 
the rimless glasses. His body, 
round and firm as a rubber ball 
under the wide brown waistcoat 
and the gold watch-chain, radi- 
ated joy. “What a specimen!” he 
said, taking the biped’s jaw in 
one hand to open the mouth. 
“See the dentition!” The biped’s 
“teeth” were two solid pieces of 
cartilaginous tissue, with chisel- 
shaped cutting edges. He broke 
free nervously after a moment, 
clacking his wide jaws and shak- 
ing his head. 

“Halt, Fritz!” said Griick, seiz- 
ing him to turn him around. “See 
the musculature — perfect! The 
integument! The color! Never, I 
promise you, even on Brecht’s 
Planet, would you find such a 
biped. And he is already sexually 
mature,” said Griick, probing 
with his fat hand between Fritz’s 
legs. “Perfect! You would like to 



meet a female biped, would you 
not, Fritz?” 

The biped blinked and said 
haltingly, “My mother was a fe- 
male biped, honored sir.” 

“Ha ha!” said Griick, full of 
good humor. “So she was! Cor- 
rect, Fritz!” Rausch smiled; 
Prinzmetal smiled; even Wenzl 
almost smiled. “Come then, first 
we will show you your quarters, 
and afterward — perhaps a sur- 
prise!” 

Picking up his shiny new va- 
lise, the biped followed Griick 
and the others out of the office, 
along a high, glass- walled corri- 
dor that overlooked the grounds 
with their scattered cages. Peo- 
ple walking on the gravel paths 
looked up and began to point ex- 
citedly. Griick, in the lead, bow- 
ed and waved benignly down to 
them. 

Inside, they emerged in an 
empty hall. Wenzl produced a 
magnetic key to open a heavy 
door with a small pane of wired 
glass set into it. Inside, they 
found themselves in a small but 
conveniently arranged room, 
with walls and floor of distem- 
pered concrete, a couch which 
could be used for sitting or sleep- 
ing, a chair and table, some uten- 
sils, a washbowl and toilet. “Here 
is the bedroom,” said Dr. Griick 
with a sweeping gesture. “And 
here — ” he led the way through 
a doorless opening — “your per-

sonal living room.” The outer 
wall was of glass, through which, 
behind an iron railing, they saw 
a crowd of people. The room was 
larger and more nicely furnished 
than the one inside. The floor was 
tiled and polished. The walls 
were painted. There was a com- 
fortable relaxing chair, a televi- 
sion, a little table with some 
magazines and newspapers on it, 
a large potted plant, even a shelf 
full of books. 

“And now for the surprise!” 
cried Dr. Griick. Brushing the 
others aside, he led the way 
again through the bedroom, to 
another doorless opening in the 
far wall. The room beyond was 
much larger, with a concrete floor 
on which, however, some rubber 
mats had been laid, and two 
desks with business machines, 
filing cabinets, wire baskets, tele- 
phones, a pencil sharpener, a 
pneumatic conveyor and piles of 
documents. 

Across the room, beside one of 
the filing cabinets which had an 
open drawer, someone turned 
and looked at them in surprise. 
It was another biped, smaller 
and more faintly colored than 
Fritz. Of the other differences, 
the most notable was the organ 
in the middle of her forehead, 
which, unlike Fritz’s, was devel- 
oped into a large, egg-shaped red- 
purple ball or knob. “Now the 
surprise!” cried Dr. Griick. “Fritz, 



here stands Emma, your little 
wife!” 

With a faint shriek, the other 
biped clapped her hands over 
her head and scurried out of the 
room, leaving a storm of dropped 
papers to settle behind her. 

IT'RITZ sat in his relaxing chair, 
-*• staring disconsolately out 
through the glass at the darken- 
ing air of the Zoo grounds. It was 
late afternoon. The Zoo was 
about to close, and the paths 
were almost deserted. 

“That takes time,” Dr. Griick 
had said heartily, patting him on 
the shoulder. “Rest, get acquaint- 
ed, tomorrow is better. Fritz, 
good afternoon!” 

Left alone, curious and vague- 
ly excited, he had poked all 
around the work room, examin- 
ing papers and opening drawers, 
then had wandered over to the 
doorway of the room into which 
Emma had disappeared. But no 
sooner had he put his nose tim- 
idly inside than her voice piped, 
“Go away! Go away, go away, go 
away!" 

Since then there had been si- 
lence from the room next to his. 
At feeding time Wenzl had come 
in with a cart, had left one tray 
for him, another for Emma. But 
although he listened intently, he 
had not heard a sound of knife 
or fork, or a glass set down. 

It was exciting to think of 



12 



GALAXY 



having another biped to talk to. 
It was not right for her to refuse 
to talk to him. Why should she 
want to make him miserable? 

As he stared through the win- 
dow, his eye met that of a dark- 
haired young man who had 
paused outside. The man was 
carrying a camera and looked 
vaguely familiar. Perhaps he had 
been one of the reporters. He 
was slight and stooped, with very 
pale, clear skin and large, soft 
eyes. As they looked wordlessly 
at each other, Fritz felt an abrupt 
slipping and sliding; the room 
whirled arpund him. 

He struggled to get up from 
the floor. He could not under- 
stand what had happened to him, 
why it was suddenly so dark, 
why the room had grown so 
large. Then he squirmed up to 
hands and knees, and discovered 
that he was looking across an 
iron railing, through a window 
into a little lighted room in 
which a biped lay half sprawled 
in a chair, looking back at him 
with glazed eyes and making fee- 
ble motions with his arms. 

The afternoon breeze was crisp 
and sibilant along the path. There 
were smells of damp earth and 
of animals. Gravel crunched be- 
side him, and a courteous voice 
said, “Is anything wrong, good 
sir?” 

The biped in the lighted room 
was floundering across the floor. 



Now he was beating with both 
hands on the glass, and his 
mouth opened and shut, opened 
and shut. 

“You have dropped your cam- 
era,” said the same voice. “Allow 
me.” Someone’s hands were pat- 
ting him, with a curious muffled 
feeling, and he turned to glimpse 
a kindly, mustached face. Then 
something glittering was being 
thrust at him and he stared, with 
a kind of disbelieving wonder, as 
his hands closed automatically 
around the camera . his pink, 
hairy, five-fingered hands, with 
their pale fingernails. 

II 

T"kR. GRUCK was alone in his 
office, with some prelimi- 
nary budget figures spread out on 
his desk, and the greasy remains 
of a knackwurst dinner on a little 
table beside him. Wearing his 
reading spectacles, he looked like 
a rosy, good-humored old uncle 
out of Dickens. His little blue 
eyes blinked mildly behind the 
spectacles, and when he counted, 
his sausage-fat thumb and fingers 
went eins, zwei, drei. 

Humming, he turned a paper 
over. The melody he was hum- 
ming was I Lost My Sock in 
Lauterbach. 

The paneled room was warm, 
comfortable and silent. “And 
without my sock, I won’t go 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO

home,” hummed the Director. 

The little desk visiphone flick- 
ered to life suddenly, and the 
tiny face in the screen said, “Doc- 
tor, if you please — ” 

Griick frowned slightly, and 
pressed the stud. “Yes, Freda?” 
“Herr Wenzl wishes to speak 
with you, he says it is urgent.” 
“Well then, if it’s urgent, 
Freda, put him on.” 

“Thank you, Doctor.” 

The screen flickered again. 
Wenzl’s pale, fanatical face ap- 
peared. “Trouble with the new 
biped,” he began immediately. 

Griick took his glasses off, with 
fingers that fumbled. “The mis- 
chief!” he said. “What sort of 
trouble, Wenzl?” 

“Ten minutes ago,” said the 
head keeper precisely, “I was 
notified that Fritz was making a 
disturbance in his cage. I went 
there, and found he had been 
trying to break the window with 
a wooden chair.” 

“Terrible, but why?” cried Dr. 
Griick, his jowls wobbling. 

“I endeavored to calm Fritz,” 
continued Wenzl, “but he in- 
formed me that I was without 
authority over him, since he was 
not Fritz, but a journalist named 
Martin Naumchik.” 

Griick pursed his lips several 
times, unconsciously forming the 
syllable “Num.” He found some 
papers under his hand, looked at 
them in surprise, then pushed 



them aside with hasty, abstracted 
motions. 

“He also told me,” said Wenzl, 
“that Fritz had gone off in his 
body, with his camera and all his 
clothes.” 

Griick put both palms on his 
cheeks and stared at Wenzl’s im- 
age. In the little screen, Wenzl 
looked like a portrait doll made 
by someone with an unpleasant 
turn of fantasy. Full-sized, Wenzl 
was really not so bad. He had a 
mole, there were hairs in his 
nostrils, one saw his adam’s apple 
move when he spoke. But at the 
size of a doll, he was unbearable. 

“What steps have you taken?” 
Griick asked. 

“Restraint,” said Wenzl. 

“And your opinion?” 

“The animal is psychotic.” 
Griick closed his eyes, pinched 
the bridge of his nose between 
thumb and finger for a moment. 
He opened his eyes, settled him- 
self before the desk. “Wenzl,” he 
said, “the biped is not necessarily 
psychotic. In our ten years with 
Emma, we have also seen some 
little fits of nerves, not so? As 
for Fritz, possibly he is only 
frightened, being in a new Zoo. 
Perhaps he wants reassurance, to 
dramatize himself a little, who 
knows? Can you show me in the 
handbooks where it says a biped 
goes psychotic?” 

Wenzl was silent and did not 
change expression. 



14 



GALAXY 



“No,” said Griick. “So let’s not 
be hasty, Wenzl. Remember that 
Fritz at present is our most val- 
uable animal. Kindness, that does 
more than harsh words and beat- 
ings. A little sympathy, perhaps 
a smile — ” He smiled, showing 
his small, blunt teeth as far back 
as the molars. “So, Wenzl? Yes?” 

“You are always right, Doc- 
tor,” said the head keeper sourly. 

“Good, then we shall see. Go 
and talk to him reasonably, 
Wenzl; take off the jacket, and 
if he is calm, bring him to me.” 

UT WILL give you five reasons 
why I am Martin Naum- 
chik,” said the biped in a high, 
furious voice. His naked, green- 
spined body looked slender and 
fragile in the dark wooden chair. 
He leaned over the table toward 
Wenzl and Dr. Griick; his eyes 
were pink-rimmed, and the wide 
lipless mouth kept opening and 
closing. 

“First. I know Berlin, whereas 
your menagerie animal has never 
been here before, and certainly 
never had liberty to roam the 
streets. Ask me anything you 
like. Second. I can tell you the 
names of the editor, managing 
editor and all the rest of the staff 
of Paris-Soir, I can repeat my 
last dispatch to them word for 
word, or nearly. If you give me a 
typewriter I’ll even write it out. 
Third.” 



“But my dear Fritz — ” said 
Griick, spreading his fat pink 
hands, with an ingratiating smile. 

“Third,” repeated the biped 
angrily. “My girl-friend, Julia 
Schorr, will vouch for me, she 
lives at number forty-one, Hein- 
richstrasse, flat seventeen, her 
visi number is UNter den Linden 
8-7403, I can also tell you that 
she keeps a Siamese cat named 
Maggie and that she cooks very 
good spaghetti. My God, if it 
comes to that, I can tell you what 
kind of underclothing she wears. 
Fourth, you can examine me 
yourselves, I took a degree at the 
Sorbonne in 1999 — ask about 
literature, mathematics, history, 
whatever you like! Fifth and last, 
I am Martin Naumchik, I have 
always been Martin Naumchik, 
I never even saw this ridiculous 
biped of yours until today, and 
if you don’t help me, I promise 
you, I’ll make such a stench . .” 
He fell silent. “Well?” 

Griick and Wenzl exchanged 
glances. “My dear young sir,” 
said Griick, rumpling his untidy 
blond hair; his little eyes were 
squeezed together in a frown. 
“My dear young sir, you have 
convinced me, beyond any shad- 
ow of doubt — ” the biped started 
eagerly — “that you believe your- 
self to be one Martin Naumchik, 
a human being, and a corre- 
spondent for Paris-Soir, and so 
on, and so on.”

The biped said in a choked 
voice, “Believe! But I’ve told - 
you — ” 

“Please!” Griick held up his 
hand. “Have the politeness to 
listen. I say that there is no 
doubt, no possible doubt, that 
you believe in what you say. 
Very good! Now. Allow me to 
ask you this question.” He folded 
his hands over his paunch, and 
his rosy lips shaped themselves 
into a smile. 

“Suppose that you are Martin 
Naumchik.” He waved his hand 
generously. “Go on. Suppose it, 

I make no objection. Very well, 
now you are Martin Naumchik. 
What is the result?” 

He leaned forward and stared 
earnestly at the biped. Wenzl, be- 
side him, was grimly silent. 

“Why, you release me,” said 
the biped uncertainly. “You help 
me find that animal who has got 
into my body, and somehow — 
in some way — ■” 

“Yes?” said Dr. Griick encour- 
agingly. “Somehow — in some 
way — ” 

“There must be some way,” 
said the biped miserably. 

Griick leaned back, shaking 
his head. “To make you change 
around again? My dear young 
sir, reflect a moment on what 
you are saying. To put a man’s 
mind back in his body after it 
has gone into the body of an 
animal? Let’s not be children! 



The thing is impossible, to begin 
with! You know it as well as I 
do! Supposing that it has actual- 
ly happened once, still it’s just as 
impossible as before! My dear 
young sir! To put a man’s mind 
back in his body? How? With a 
funnel?” 

The biped was leaning his 
head on his green-spined hand. 
“If we could find out why it hap- 
pened — ” he muttered. 

“Good, yes,” said Griick sym- 
pathetically. “A very good sug- 
gestion: that is what we must do, 
by all means. Courage, Fritz, or 
Martin, as the case may be! This 
will take time, we must be pre- 
pared to wait. Patience and cour- 
age, eh, Fritz?” 

The biped nodded, looking ex- 
hausted. 

“Good, then it’s understood,” 
said Griick cheerfully, getting up. 
“We shall do everything we can, 
you may be quite sure of that, 
and in the meantime — ” he mo- 
tioned toward Wenzl, who had 
also risen — “a little cooperation, 
no trouble for poor Wenzl. 
Agreed, Fritz?” 

“You’re going to keep me 
here? On display?” cried the 
biped, stiffening again with in- 
dignation. 

“For the present,” said Griick 
soothingly. “After all, what choice 
have we got? To begin with, 
where would you go? How would 
you live? Slowly, we must go 



16 



GALAXY 



slowly, Fritz. Take an older 
man’s advice, haste can be the 
ruin of everything. Slowly, slow- 
ly, Fritz, patience and courage — ” 

Wenzl took the biped’s slender 
arm and began to guide him out 
of the room. “My name is Martin 
Naumchik,” he muttered weakly 
as he disappeared. 

f'T'HE dim gray light of early 
morning flooded the outer 
rooms, illuminating everything 
but emphasizing nothing. For 
some reason — the biped had 
noticed it before — it made you 
see the undersides of things more 
than usual, the loose dingy cloth 
hanging under the seat of a chair, 
the grime and dust in corners, 
the ordinarily inconspicuous 
streaks, smears, scratches. 

He prowled restlessly down 
the corridor, past the closed door- 
way of the next room — the fe- 
male had apparently up-ended a 
table against it — into the fluor- 
escent-lit office space with its 
hooded machines, then back 
again. In his own inner room he 
caught sight of an ugly face in 
the mirror — greenish and flat- 
muzzled, like an impossible hy- 
brid of dog and cock — and for a 
horrible instant did not realize 
it was his own. 

He clutched at the wall and 
began to weep. Strangled, inhu- 
man sounds came out of his 
throat. 



Ten hours, ten hours or more, 
it must be. Just around supper 
time it had happened, and now it 
was past dawn. Ten hours, and 
he still wasn’t used to it, it was 
harder to bear than ever. 

He had to get out. 

The biped’s little valise was 
standing on the floor of the inner 
room near the washbowl. He 
pounced on it, ripped it open, 
flung the contents around. Tooth- 
brush, chess set, some cheap writ- 
ing paper, a dog-eared paper- 
bound book called Brecht’s Plan- 
et: Riddle of the Universe; noth- 
ing useful. Weeping, he ran into 
the office room and snatched up 
the telephone receiver. The line 
was still dead. Probably it was 
not linked into the zoo switch- 
board this early in the morning. 
What else? 

He caught sight of one of the 
typewriters, stopped in surprise, 
then sat down before it and took 
the cover off. 

There was paper in a drawer. 
He rolled a sheet into the platen, 
switched the machine on, and sat 
for a moment anxiously gripping 
his three-fingered hands together. 

The words took shape in his 
mind: My name is Martin Naum- 
chik. I am being held prisoner 
in . 

His hands stabbed at the key- 
board, and the type bars piled 
up against the guide with a clat- 
ter and a snarl; the carriage

jumped over and the paper leap- 
ed up a space. 

The pain of realization was so 
great that he instinctively tried 
to bit his lip. He felt the stiff 
flesh move numbly, sliding 
against his teeth. Biting his lip 
was one of the things he could 
not do now. And typing was an- 
other. 

It was too much. He would 
never get used to it. He would al- 
ways forget, and be snubbed up 
like an animal at the end of a 
chain . 

After a moment, half-blinded 
by tears, he pried at the jammed 
keys until they fell back. Then, 
painfully, picking out the letters 
with one finger, he began again: 
“My name is M . .” 

In half an hour, he had fin- 
ished his account of the facts. 
Next it would be necessary to es- 
tablish his identity. Perhaps that 
should come first, or the story 
would never even be read. He 
took a fresh sheet, and wrote: 

M. Frederic Stein 

PARIS-SOIR 

98, rue de la Victoire 

Paris 9e (Seine) 

Dear Frederic: 

You will know the enclosed is 
really from me by the following: 
When I was last in Paris, you and 
I went to the Rocking Florse and 
got tanked on mint whistles. There 
were three greenies in the jug. You 
told me about certain troubles with 
your wife, and we discussed your 



taking a correspondent’s job in the 

Low Countries. 

This is not a joke; I need your 
help — in God’s name, do what- 
ever 

He paused, and over the ma- 
chine’s hum was lucky enough to 
hear the whisper of footsteps in 
the corridor. He had barely time 
to turn off the machine, cover it 
and hide the typed pages in a 
drawer. 

A young keeper with a sullen, 
pimpled face came in, wheeling 
a cart with two steaming trays. 
It was breakfast time. 

His first day as a caged animal 
was about to begin. 

Ill 

TTERE in the middle of the 
city, the streets were as 
bright as if it were day. Over the 
tesselated pavements people were 
wandering. Music drifted seduc- 
tively from an open doorway; all 
the scarlet blossoms of the An- 
tarean air-weed, clinging to the 
sides of the buildings, were open 
and exuding a fresh pungence. 

In one of the brilliant display 
windows, as he passed, the young 
man saw a row of green creatures 
in glass cages — sluggish globu- 
lar animals about the size of a 
tomato, with threads of limbs 
and great dull green eyes. They 
floated on the green-scummed 
surface of the shallow water in 



18

the cages, or climbed feebly on 
bits of wet bark. Over them was 
a streamer: TAKE A WOG 

HOME TO THE CHILDREN. 

He passed on. The people 
around him, moving in groups 
and couples for the most part, 
were a different sort than he was 
used to seeing at the Zoo in 
Hamburg. They were better 
dressed, better fed, their skins 
were clearer and redder and they 
laughed more. The women were 
confections of white-blonde hair 
and red cheeks, with sparkling 
white teeth and flashing nails, 
and they wore puffed, shining 
garments like the glittering paper 
around an expensive gift. The 
men were more austere in dark, 
dull reds and blues. Their feet 
were thinly shod in gleaming pat- 
ent leather, and their hair shone 
with pomade. Their talk, in the 



unfamiliar Berlin accent, eddied 
around him: confident tones, 

good humor, barks of laughter. 

Very faintly, beneath his feet, 
the star mosaic of the pavement 
shook to the passage of an ex- 
press car underneath. Here 
in the above-ground everyone 
was on foot. There was no wheel- 
ed vehicle in sight, not even an 
aircar: only the bright thread of 
one of the Flugbahnen visible in 
the distance. 

Around the corner, in a little 
square surrounding the heroic 
anodized aluminum figure of a 
man in spaceman’s dress, helmet 
off, an exultant expression on his 
metal face, the young man saw 
a tall illuminated panel on the 
side of a building. Luminous 
words were shuddering slowly 
down the panel, line by line. The 
young man moved closer, through

READ FULL DETAILS IN 
THE BERLINER ZEITUNG 

The letters drifted down, like 
tongues of cold flame, and were 
followed by an advertisement for 
Heineken’s beer. 

The young man turned away, 
having read all the headlines 
with appreciation but without 
any interest whatever; he walked 
further down the street and 
gazed in fascination at the mar- 
quee of a cinema, where through 
some illusion brightly-colored 



ten-foot figures of men and wom- 
en seemed to be dancing. Even 
here he could not give his full 
attention. He was bothered, and 
increasingly so, by certain de- 
mands of his, body. 

TTE HAD an insistent urge to 
tear off the muffling, un- 
familiar garments he was wear- 
ing, but realized it would attract 
attention to himself, and besides, 
this bald body would probably 
be cold. He had not realized that 
a simple thing like this could be- 
come so difficult. At home in the 
zoo he had had his own little w.c., 
and that was that. People must 
have theirs, but where? What 
did people do who were strangers 
in Berlin? He looked around. He 
did not see a policeman, but a 
woman who was passing with her 
escort paused, looking at him, 
and on an impulse he stepped 
forward and said politely, “Par- 
don me, madam, but can you 
direct me to the w.c.?” 

Her face registered first sur- 
prise, then shock, and she turned 
to her companion saying angrily, 
“Come on, he’s drunk.” They 
walked rapidly away, the man’s 
scowling face turned over his 
shoulder. The word “Disgrace- 
ful!” floated back. 

Surprised and hurt, the young 
man stood for a moment watch- 
ing them out of sight; then he 
turned in the opposite direction. 



20 



GALAXY 



The place he was passing now 
was called “Konstantin’s Cafe.” 
The sight of people sitting at 
table, visible through the big win- 
dow, reminded him that he was 
hungry and thirsty. After a mo- 
ment’s hesitation, he went in. 

A slender red-jacketed waiter 
met him alertly in the foyer. 
“Yes, sir? A table for one?” 

“Yes, if you like,” said the 
young man. The waiter hesitated, 
glancing at him oddly, then turn- 
ed through the archway. “Come 
this way, sir.” 

The young man gave his sur- 
coat and camera to a girl who 
asked for them. Inside, waiters in 
red jackets were moving like 
ants among the snowy tabletops; 
the room was crowded with rich 
silks and velvets of all colors, 
flushed clean faces, smiling 
mouths; unfamiliar smells of food 
swam in the air. The thick carpet 
muffled all footsteps, but there 
was a heavy burden of voices, 
clattering silverware, and music 
from some invisible source. 

A little intimidated by so much 
crowded luxury, the young man 
followed the waiter to a small 
table and sat down. 

The waiter opened a stiff 
pasteboard folder with a snap 
and presented it; the young man 
took it automatically, and in a 
moment perceived that it was a 
list of foods. 

“To begin with, an aperitif, 



sir?” asked the waiter. “Some 
hors-d’oeuvres? Or shall we say 
a salad?” 

The young man blinked at the 
menu, then set it down. “No,” he 
replied, “but — ” 

“Just the dinner, then, sir,” 
said the waiter briskly. “If the 
gentleman will permit, I recom- 
mend the truite au beurre cano- 
peen, with a Moselle, very good, 
sir.” 

“All right,” the young man said 
hesitantly, “but first — ” 

“Ah, an aperitif, after all?” 
asked the waiter, smiling with 
annoyance. “Some hors-d’oeuvres? 
Or—” 

“No, I don’t wish any of those, 
thank you,” said the young man, 
making a clumsy gesture and 
oversetting a goblet. 

“But then, what is it that the 
gentleman wishes?” The waiter 
righted the goblet, brushed at the 
tablecloth, stood back. 

The young man blinked slow- 
ly. “I wish for you to direct me 
to the w.c., if you would be so 
kind.” 

TTE half expected the waiter to 
react like the woman in the 
street, but the man’s keen face 
only closed expressionlessly, and 
he leaned down to murmur, “The 
doorway behind the curtain at 
the rear, sir.” 

“Thank you, you are very 
kind.” 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



21 



“Not at all, sir.” The waiter 
went away. The young man got 
up and went in the indicated di- 
rection. Although he tried to 
move carefully, he was still very 
clumsy in his body, and some- 
times would forget and pause be- 
tween steps to try and shake off 
one of his shoes. When he did 
this, he noticed that some of the 
diners l'ooked at him strangely. 
He determined to break the hab- 
as soon as possible. 

When he returned, after some 
trouble with the unfamiliar fast- 
enings, the waiter was just re- 
moving from a little silver cart 
a covered platter, which he 
placed on the table and unveiled 
with a flourish. The young man 
sat down. The waiter took a 
slender bottle from the cart, un- 
corked it, poured a pale liquid 
into the goblet and stood back 
expectantly. 

The young man looked at his 
plate. 

The food steamed gently; 
there were five or six different 
things, each of its own color, 
beautifully arranged on the plat- 
ter. He had never seen any of 
them before, except possibly in 
magazines, and all the smells 
were unfamiliar. Nevertheless, he 
picked up his fork and pried at 
the largest object, a roughly oval 
burnt-brown mass which came 
away flakily, running with juices. 
He put the fork in his mouth on 



the second try. The food was a 
moist, unpleasant lump on his 
tongue: the taste was so startling 
that he immediately turned his 
head and spat it out. 

The waiter looked down at the 
carpet, then at the young man. 
Then he went away. 

The young man was gingerly 
trying some light green strips, 
which he found unusual but pal- 
atable, when the waiter came 
back. “Sir, the manager would 
like to speak with you, if you 
please.” He gestured toward the 
foyer. 

“Oh? With me?” The young 
man stood up agreeably, overset- 
ting the goblet again. The pale 
liquid ran over the tablecloth 
and began to drip onto the car- 
pet. “I am so sorry,” he said, and 
began to mop at it with his 
napkin. 

“It’s of no consequence,” said 
the waiter grimly, and took the 
young man by the arm. “If you 
please, sir.” 

In the foyer they met another 
waiter, who took his other arm. 
Someone handed him his surcoat 
and camera. Together the two 
waiters began to propel him to- 
ward the exit. 

The young man craned his 
head around. “The manager?” he 
asked. 

“The manager,” said the first 
waiter, “wishes you to leave 
quietly, without disturbance, sir.” 



22 



GALAXY 



“But I haven’t yet paid for my 
food,” said the young man. 

“There is no charge, sir,” said 
the waiter, and they were at the 
door. The two gave him a last 
push. He was in the street. 

TN THE men’s room of a pfen- 
nig gallery, a little later (at 
least he was becoming adept at 
finding w.c.’s), the young man 
was examining the contents of 
his pockets. He discovered that 
he was Martin Naumchik, Euro- 
pean citizen, born Asnieres 
(Seine) 1976, complexion fair, 
eyes brown, hair brown, no arrest 
record, no curtailment of citizen- 
ship, no identifying marks or 
scars, employed by Paris-Soir, 98 
rue de la Victoire, Paris (9e); 
that he had a driver’s license, a 
Cordon Bleu diner’s card, a press 
card in five languages and a note- 
book full of penciled scribbling 
which he could not read. In his 
billfold were forty marks, and in 
the pockets of his trousers, jacket 
and surcoat some coins amount- 
ing to another two or three 
marks. That was all, except some 
ticket stubs, a key on a gold ring, 
tissues, pocket lint, a half-empty 
pack of cigarettes, and a 
crumpled envelope, addressed to 
Herr Martin Naumchik, 67, Gas- 
tnerstrasse, Berlin. 

The young man had partially 
satisfied his hunger with two 
sausages on rolls, bought at a 



stall near the gallery, but he was 
tired, lonely and bewildered. At 
that moment he would have been 
glad to go back to the Zoo, but 
he had lost his directions and did 
not know where it was. He left 
the gallery and moved on down 
the street. 

The cinema beckoned to him 
with the open wings of its lobby 
and the gigantic displays on 
either side: figures of men and 
women, glossy leaves, planets 
floating in a violet-gray sky. Il- 
luminated signs announced: 

Experience new sensations! 

Unprecedented excitement! 

UNDER SEVEN MOONS 
Stella Pain — Willem DeGroot 

“Indescribable!” — 

Tageblatt. 

The price was two marks ten. 
The young man paid, took his 
ticket and went in. A few people 
were standing about in the ante- 
room, talking and smoking. 
There were exotic fruits and con- 
fections for sale at a long counter, 
and rows of automatic machines 
for drinks, candy, tissues. The 
young man gave his ticket to 
the turnstile machine at the door, 
got a stub back and found him- 
self in a huge well of darkened 
seats, lit only by faint glimmers 
from the distant walls. Here and 
there around the vast bowl, 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



23 



clumps of people were sitting. 
Three-quarters of the seats were 
empty. There was very little 
noise, no one was talking or mov- 
ing, evidently the show had not 
yet begun. The young man 
groped his way down the aisle, 
chose a seat and unfolded it. The 
instant he settled down and put 
his hands on the armrests, sound 
and motion exploded around him. 

TTE sprang up convulsively, in- 
to darkness and silence. The 
huge almost empty bowl of the 
theater was just as it had been 
before: the flashing phantom 

shapes he had seen were nowhere. 

After a moment, cautiously, he 
touched one of the armrests 
again. Nothing happened. The 
other armrest. Still nothing. Gin- 
gerly and with trepidation, he 
unfolded the seat and lowered 
himself into it. 

Again the sudden blast of light 
and sound. This time he glimpsed 
figures, heard words spoken be- 
fore he leaped upright again. 

All around him, the people 
were sitting in eerie, intent sil- 
ence. Then this must be how one 
saw a movie — not projected on 
a wall, as he had always imag- 
ined, but somehow mysteriously 
existing when one sat in the 
chair. Shaking with nervousness, 
but determined not to be a cow- 
ard, he sat down one more and 
gripped the armrests hard. 



Light and sensation surrounded 
him. He was seeing the upper 
portions of two gigantic humans, 
a female and a male, against a 
violet sky in which two moons 
shone dimly. Simultaneously 
there was a grinding, insistent 
roar of wind and the man’s sten- 
torian voice bellowed out, “Ger- 
da, you are mine!” His face stared 
into hers, his strong brown hands 
gripped her bare arms while she 
replied, “I know it, Friedrich.” 
The words crashed into the young 
man’s eardrums like bombs. The 
two immense bodies were not far 
away, at the end of the theater, 
but loomed before him almost 
close enough to touch. They 
glowed with color, not a natural 
color but something altogether 
different and arresting, luminous 
pastel tones overlying shadows 
of glowing darkness, with a rath- 
er disturbing suggestion of dead 
black in all the outlines, almost 
like a colored engraving. They 
had depth but not reality, and 
yet they were incredibly more 
than mere pictures. The young 
man realized, with a shock of sur- 
prise, that he could smell the 
cold salt air, and that without 
knowing in the least how, he was 
aware of the very texture of the 
giant woman’s skin — smooth 
and waxy, like a soft artificial 
fruit — and of the cat-smelling 
tawny softness of her long blonde 
. hair whipping in the wind, and 



24 



GALAXY 



the hard-edged glossy stiffness of 
the green leaves in the near back- 
ground. 

“Gerda!” roared the man. 

“Friedrich!” she trumpeted sad- 
ly- 

Then without moving a muscle 
the two of them vertiginously re- 
ceded, as if an invisible car were 
drawing them rapidly away, and 
as they dwindled, standing and 
staring at one another, green- 
leaved shrubs gathered in to fill 
the space, and the sky somehow 
grew bigger — there were three 
moons drifting with a perceptible 
motion through the violet sky — 
and at that moment with a thun- 
derous rushing sound, the rain be- 
gan. Dry as he sat there, the 
young man could feel the stream- 
ing wetness pelting the leaves; it 
was lukewarm. Music skirled up 
in wild dissonances, lightning 
cracked the sky apart and thun- 
der boomed. 

It was too much. 

The young man stood up, 
trembling all over. Sight, touch 
and sound vanished instantly. He 
was alone in the vast theater 
with the silent, motionless people 
who sat in darkness. 

He moved shakily to the aisle 
and went out, grateful for the 
quiet and the sense of being alone 
in his skin again. He was sorry 
to have given up so quickly, but 
consoled himself with the thought 
that it was his first time. Later, 



perhaps, he would grow used to 
it. 

4 T A kiosk in the middle of 
the street, newspapers and 
magazines were on sale in metal 
dispensers. Beside this stood a 
dirty small boy and an old gray 
woman, with a portable teleset 
tuned to a popular singer. The 
little boy was singing harmony 
with him, badly, in a strained 
soprano. There were coins scat- 
tered on the little folding table 
in front of the teleset. Further 
along, two drunken and dishev- 
eled men were scuffing ineffec- 
tually, grabbing at each other’s 
surcoats for balance. A brightly 
painted woman giggled, but most 
people paid no attention. Three 
dark young men walked by a- 
breast, scowling, with identical 
dark long surcoats and oiled fore- 
locks. Tall cold-light signs over 
the buildings blinked, MOBIL. 
TELEFUNKEN, KRUPP-FAR- 
BEN. The young man moved 
through the crowd, listening to 
the voices and the snatches of 
music from open doorways, look- 
ing at faces, pausing to stare at 
the glittering merchandise in 
shop windows. 

When he had been walking in 
the same direction for some time, 
he came upon a store which 
seemed to fill an entire square 
of its own, with many busy en- 
trances and rows of brilliantly 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



25 



lighted display windows. The 
name, in tall cold-light letters 
over each entrance, was “ELEK- 
TRA.” For want of any other 
direction, the young man drifted 
in with the crowd. 

Inside, the store appeared to 
be one gigantic room, high-ceil- 
inged, echoing, glittering every- 
where with reflected lights. 
Banks of brightly illuminated 
display cases were ranged in par- 
allel lines, leaving aisles between. 
In open spaces were statues, 
great flowering plants, con- 
structions of golden and white 
metal. The murmuring of the 
crowd washed back from the dis- 
tant ceiling: up there, the young 
man noticed, were fiery trails of 
light, red, green, blue, amber, 
that pulsed and seemed to travel 
along the ceiling like the ex- 
hausts of rockets. The air was 
heavy with women’s mingled 
scents and with other, uniden- 
tifiable odors; there was quiet 
music in the background, and a 
faint, multiple clicking or clat- 
tering sound. 

The young man went in tenta- 
tively, listening and watching. A 
woman and an older man were 
standing by the entrance to one 
of the aisles, arguing vehemently 
in low, crisp voices; the young 
man caught the words, “Twenty 
millions at the minimum.” A 
child in a red coat was crying, 
being dragged along by an angry 



woman. A man in dark-blue uni- 
form went hurrying by, the 
trousers snapping about his 
ankles. 

There were signs in colored 
lights on the ceiling; one red one 
said “MEN’S WEAR” and a red 
trail went pulsing off from it; an- 
other, blue, said “WATCHES 
AND JEWELRY”; another, 
green, “CAMERAS.” 

The young man followed the 
green trail, fascinated. Lines of 
people, most of them women, 
were moving slowly along the 
row of showcases. Here and 
there, the young man saw some- 
one put money into one of the 
cases, open the glass front and 
take out a blouse or an under- 
garment, a pair of stockings, a 
scarf. 

The young man had never 
seen so many beautiful things in 
one place. Here he was now in a 
whole corridor lined with noth- 
ing but cameras, hundreds of 
cameras, all achingly polished 
and bright; the winking re- 
flections from their round eyes 
of metal and glass followed him 
as he walked. He actually saw a 
man buy one: a huge thing, big 
as the man’s head, with pale 
leather sides and a complexity 
of lens tubes, dials, meters. The 
man held- it reverently in his 
hands, staring at it as if at a 
loved one’s face. As the glass 
door closed, a mechanism slowly 



26 



GALAXY 







revolved and another camera, 
just like the first, descended to 
fill the empty case. As the cus- 
tomer walked away, the young 
man looked at the price on the 
chrome rim of the showcase: it 
was 700 marks. He looked again 
at the beautiful camera behind 
the glass door, then at the one 
which hung around his neck. It 
was smaller and the metal was 
not so bright; the black sides 
were worn in places, and it did 
not look so beautiful as it had 
before. The young man walked 
on, looking down at himself, and 
was aware that his dark surcoat 
was worn thin at the cuffs, his 
shoes needed polishing, there was 
lint and dust on his trousers. 

So, then, it was not enough to 
be a human being! One must also 
have money. The young man 
vaguely supposed that if he had 
700 marks, his head would not 
ache so, he would not have the 
uncomfortable feeling in his in- 
sides that was bothering him 
more and more, he would not be 
tired and irritable. 

But he had not the least idea 
how people got money. 

r T'0 make himself feel better, he 
stopped in the next section 
and bought a wristwatch with an 
expanding platinum band. He 
put a ten-mark bill into the slot. 
The mechanism hummed and 
gripped the ten marks, pulling 



it gradually inside until it was 
all gone; then ther was a clatter 
in the receptacle underneath, 
and the glass door swung open. 
The young man took out his 
watch and admired it. The mar- 
velous thing was already run- 
ning, the second hand sweeping 
silently around the black dial. 
He put it on his wrist, first the 
wrong way around, then the right 
way. In the receptacle were 
twenty-seven pfennigs in silver 
and copper. He scooped them up. 
Above, the mechanism was re- 
volving and another wristwatch 
came into view. The young man 
found that he could not resist it. 
He put another ten marks into 
the machine, receiving another 
wristwatch and another twenty- 
seven pfennigs in change. He put 
the second watch on his other 
wrist. Now he felt rich and hand- 
some. He held out his arms 
stiffly, to make the cuffs of his 
sleeves slide back so that he 
could admire his watches. Both 
showed the identical time: 20 
hours 13 minutes. Now he would 
always be sure what time it was, 
because if the two watches 
showed different times he would 
know one was wrong, but if the 
same time, then they must be 
right. 

Feeling pleased to have 
worked this out for himself, and 
to have made so sound a pur- 
chase, he went on. In an open 



28 



GALAXY 



space at the end of the aisle, he 
saw curved escalators rising in 
spirals past the ceiling, and be- 
yond them, banks of elevators 
with doors that constantly 
opened and shut: click, a door 
was open, someone stepped in, 
click, the door closed, and in an 
instant it had whisked its pas- 
senger off and was open again. 

Diagonally across the open 
space, he caught sight of another 
group of illuminated trails on the 
ceiling, and it seemed to him that 
one of them was labeled “Foods.” 
He went that way eagerly, and 
nearly knocked down a hatless 
man in blue uniform, who 
frowned at him and said, “I beg 
your pardon, sir.” 

“No, I beg your pardon.” 

“Not at all, sir.” 

“It’s very kind of you.” 

“An honor, sir.” 

They both bowed and went on 
their way. The young man found 
that the sign did say “Foods.” He 
followed its pink trail until he 
came to a sunken area full of 
people with metal carts, and the 
carts loaded with packages. He 
went down the five or six steps, 
sniffing the air, and found a new 
set of lighted trails that pointed 
to “Canned Goods,” “Perisha- 
bles,” “Meats” and so on. Passing 
through “Canned Goods,” he 
came upon a stout man in a plaid 
surcoat who was lifting a can out 
of an open case and putting it on 



top of three others just like it in 
a cart. 

The young man paused to 
watch. 

The mechanism inside the 
case slowly revolved; another 
large, odd-shaped can came 
down into view, and now the 
young man could see that it 
was labeled “COPENHAGEN 
SMOKED HAM,” with a picture 
of a slab of pink meat. The cover 
of the display case was still open. 
As soon as the mechanism 
stopped, the stout man reached 
in, took out the canned ham, and 
put it in his cart along with the 
other four. The mechanism be- 
gan to revolve again. The stout 
buyer glanced over his shoulder 
at the young man, hesitated, then 
took out a sixth ham and put it 
with the other five. The mechan- 
ism revolved again. As far as the 
young man could make out, the 
stout man had not put in any 
money. Each time he removed 
a ham, the door swung down but 
did not latch. Then the stout 
man lifted it up again and 
reached for the next ham. 

r i ''he buyer looked around again, 
glanced from side to side, 
and muttered, “Go on, get away, 
can’t you see I’m busy?” 

“I’m sorry,” said the young 
man politely, “but I only wanted 
to be next for the hams.” 

The stout customer growled 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



29 



something, trying to look at the 
next ham and at the young man 
simultaneously. 

“Pardon?” 

“I said devil’s dirt,” the stout 
man growled more distinctly. 
The mechanism stopped; he 
reached in and took the seventh 
ham. 

At that moment one of the 
blue-uniformed men appeared at 
the end of the aisle. The stout 
customer was holding the ham 
close to his chest. The blue-uni- 
formed man turned toward them. 

The stout customer wheeled 
abruptly, thrust the ham into the 
ypung man’s arms, said petu- 
lantly, “Here, then,” and walked 
rapidly away. 

“One moment, please!” called 
the approaching blue-uniformed 
map. 

Still moving rapidly away, and 
without turning his head, the 
stout man said something that 
sounded like, “Run, you fool!” 

The man in the blue uniform 
took something out of his pocket. 
It was an electric bell, which 
began to ring insistently and 
loudly. Inside the display case, 
the mechanism was revolving, 
presenting another canned ham. 
The young man looked at it, then 
at the one he held, and felt a 
vague alarm. The stout man was 
moving faster; the one in blue 
uniform was waving and shout- 
ing. The young man turned and 



began to run, although he did not 
know why. 

At the front of the food 
section, another blue-uniformed 
man was coming toward him 
from the left. The young man 
scrambled up the five steps, 
holding the canned ham awk- 
wardly to his chest. The stout 
man was nowhere in sight. 

“Stop!” called one of the blue- 
uniformed men. But the young 
man’s heart was beating in un- 
reasonable panic. He ran across 
the open space, dodging back 
and forth between shoppers’ 
carts, pursued by shouts and the 
ringing of the bell. Another bell 
began to ring, somewhere off to 
his right, then a third. Utterly 
terrified, unaware of what he was 
doing, the young man dropped 
the ham on the floor and ran at 
a woman with a full cart, who 
shrieked and pushed it into an- 
other cart, oversetting both and 
spilling oranges like quicksilver 
on the floor. The young man ran 
past her, nearly falling, and 
found himself between two ad- 
vancing men in blue, while be- 
fore him was only a decorative 
grille of arabesques in gold- 
plated metal, which reached all 
the way to ' a balcony on the 
second level. With a gasp of 
fright, the young man flung him- 
self at this grille and began to 
limb it. In spite of the clumsiness 
of his feet, which would not grip 



30 



GALAXY 



and could not even feel the 
metal, he was above the men’s 
heads in a moment, and they 
shook their fists at him, shouting, 
“Despicable ruffian, come down 
here!” 

The young man kept on climb- 
ing. Shortly, the people on the 
floor below were colorful dolls, 
many with faces turned to look 
up at him. One of the blue-uni- 
formed men had begun to climb 
the grille, but now the young 
man was almost at the top. 

He arrived at the top of the 
grille, and reaching up, found 
that he could grasp the railing of 
the balcony and swing himself 
up and over. Panting with ex- 
ertion, he found himself in a nar- 
row corridor, lined on the wall 
side with open doorways from 
which came the sounds of voices 
and the clicking of machines. A 
man stepped out of a doorway 
some distance down the corridor 
and craned his neck to listen to 
the sound of the bells. He turned, 
saw the young man. “Hi!” he 
called, starting forward. 

'T'HE young man ran again. 

Faces turned, startled, in- 
side the rooms as he passed; he 
caught glimpses of men and 
women in their blouse sleeves, of 
desks and office equipment. The 
next door was closed and was 
marked “Stair.” The young man 
opened it, hesitated briefly be- 



tween two narrow flights, then 
chose the up flight and went 
bounding up, three steps at a 
time, swinging around at each 
tiny landing until he grew dizzy. 
Below, voices echoed. He kept 
on going up past other landings 
and closed, dark doors, narrower 
and dingier, until he reached the 
top. The stairs ended at one last 
door, lit only by a grimy skylight 
through which filtered a dim vio- 
let glow. 

The young man paused to lis- 
ten. Deep down, there were tiny 
voices, like the chirping of insects 
under layer after layer of earth. 

He opened the door and went 
in. He was on a floor of empty 
rooms, dark and gray with dust. 
Everything was much older and 
shabbier-looking than the glitter- 
ing aisles downstairs. In the weak 
light from small pebble-glass win- 
dows, he saw goods piled in the 
corners of one room, a neglected 
huddle of filing cabinets in an- 
other. There was no one here. 
No one had come here for a long 
time. 

At the end of the hall, half 
hidden by an ancient wardrobe, 
was another door, another stair, 
the narrowest and darkest of all 
— plain bare wood, that creaked 
under his steps as he went up. It 
was only one short flight, and at 
the top he found himself in a 
tiny room with slanting walls. 

Bundles of papers lay piled on 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



31 



the floor, yellow and brittle un- 
der their coating of dust. There 
was a length of rope, an old light 
bulb or two, some shredded bits 
of paper that might have been 
gnawed by small animals. All 
this he saw in the dim, cool light 
from a triangular window under 
the peak of the roof. It was a 
wide window, framed in old or- 
nate moulding that filled almost 
the entire wall, and from it, when 
he had rubbed a clear space with 
his hand, he could see the city 
spread out below him. 

Silent and empty it lay under 
the violet sky, all the buildings 
peacefully ranked one beyond 
another out to the misty horizon. 
Some of the building faces were 
illuminated by the glow of the 
avenues, but no sound came up 
from those lower levels. It was 
like a deserted city, whose in- 
habitants had gone away leaving 
all the lights on. The luminous 
strand of a Flugbahn hung empty 
against the sky. In the twilight 
the letters of sky-signs stared 
coldly: MOBIL, URANIA, IBM, 
ALT WIEN. 

The young man looked around 
him with calm satisfaction. 

He was still hungry and in 
bodily distress, but here he was 
safe and sheltered. With those 
papers he could make a bed, 
here by the window. He would 
look out at the world all day, 
as long as he wished, and no one 



would know he was here at all. 

He sat down and let his mus- 
cles relax. After all, to be free 
and to have a place of one’s own 
were what mattered most. He 
had been terribly frightened, but 
now he could see that it was all 
coming right in the end. 

With a contented glance 
around at the dim, slanting walls, 
which already had the comforting 
familiarity of home, he lay down 
on the floor and let the slow 
waves of silence muffle him to 
sleep. 

IV 

nPHE food in the tray turned 
■*- out to be a steaming mess 
of something dark green and 
odorous, the consistency of mud, 
with chunks of fibrous substance 
mixed up in it. 

The biped was hungry, but re- 
pelled by the unappetizing ap- 
pearance and smell of the stuff, 
and did not touch any. Next door 
he heard the scrape of a spoon 
on the metal plate: the female 
was eating hers, anyhow. The 
keeper had removed the table 
from her doorway and lectured 
her severely. He had not heard 
what she replied, if anything. 
The biped tried to sip water 
from the bowl on his tray, found 
that his stiff mouth would not 
permit it, and dashed the bowl 
to the floor with a sudden howl 



32 



GALAXY 



of fury. Immediately afterward 
he grew thirsty, and filled the 
bowl again from the washbowl 
faucet. He tried lapping the 
water with his tongue, and got 
some relief that way, but not 
enough water to swallow. He 
ended by pouring water into his 
open mouth, half choking him- 
self before he discovered the 
trick of throwing his head back 
to swallow. 

His chest and legs were sod- 
den, the feathery spines clumped 
together with moisture. He felt 
acutely uncomfortable until he 
had dried himself with a towel. 
For some reason, the trivial inci- 
dent depressed him severely. He 
tried to cheer himself up by 
thinking of the unfinished letter 
hidden in the desk, but to his 
despair found that he no longer 
cared about it. He sat in the 
inner room and stared dully at 
the wall. 

He was roused from his torpor 
by footsteps in the office space, 
and Griick’s cheerful voice call- 
ing, “Fritz! Emma!” The pimpled 
young "keeper came in, looked at 
his untouched tray and removed 
it without comment. 

The biped got up, simply be- 
cause it would have required 
mpre resolution to stay where he 
was. He followed the keeper into 
the office space. 

The keeper was showing the 
tray to Griick and Wenzl, who 



stood side by side, Griick ample 
in brown broadcloth, Wenzl nar- 
row in his white smock. “Noth- 
ing eaten, sirs.” 

Wenzl glared, but Griick said 
expansively, “Never mind, never 
mind! Take it away, Rudi — 
this morning our guest is not so 
hungry, it’s natural! Now!” He 
rubbed his fat pink hands togeth- 
er, beaming. “But where is our 
beautiful Emma?” He turned. 
“Emma?” 

The female was in the door- 
way of her room, peeping out, 
only one side of her face visible. 
At Griick’s command she advan- 
ced a few steps, then hesitated. 
Her arms were raised, both 
hands clasped tightly over her 
forehead, hiding the knob. 

“But, Emma,” said Griick re- 
proachfully, “is this our hospital- 
ity? When were we ever so im- 
polite? And our friend’s first day, 
too!” 

She made a wordless sound, 
looking at the biped. 

“You are alarmed, Emma, he 
frightens you?” Griick asked, 
looking from one to another. “Ah, 
loveling, there is nothing to be 
frightened of. You are going to 
be great friends — yes, you will 
see! And besides, Emma, what 
about all the work that is here?” 

The female spoke up unexpect- 
edly, in a thin, absurdly human 
voice. “Take him away, please, 
and I’ll do it all myself, Herr 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



33 



Doktor.” She glanced toward the 
biped, then ducked her head. 

“No, no, Emma, that is not 
right. But let me tell you some- 
thing. Because you are so 
alarmed, so frightened, we want 
you to be happy, Emma, we are 
going to do something to relieve 
this fear. (Wenzl, some chalk.) 
Fritz shall stay and help you 
with the work — ” 

“No, no.” 

“Yes, yes! And you will like it, 
wait and see. (The chalk, Wenzl 
— ha!)” Wenzl had spoken 

sharply to Rudi, the pimpled 
young keeper, who, blushing, had 
fumbled in his pockets and pro- 
duced a piece of pink chalk. 
Wenzl, snatching it, now handed 
it to Griick. 

“See here, Emma,” said Griick 
soothingly, “we are going to 
draw a line on the floor. I draw 
it myself, because I want you to 
be happy — so . Bending with 
a grunt, he began at the wall 
between the two bedroom doors 
and drew a wavering chalk line 
across the room, separating it in- 
to two roughly equal parts. 

“Now,” he said from the far 
side, straightening up in panting 
triumph, “see here, Emma, on 
this side, Fritz stays. Correct, 
Fritz?” 

“Whatever you like,” said the 
biped indifferently. 

“See, he gives me his promise,” 
said Griick, with emphasis. “And 



my promise to you, Emma. So 
long as he stays on his side of 
the room, you will work on your 
side, and not be frightened. But 
if he should cross over the line, 
Emma, then you have my per- 
mission to be frightened again, 
and to run into your room and 
bar the door! Understood?” 

The female seemed impressed. 
“Very well then, Herr Doktor,” 
she said at last. 

“Good!” ejaculated Griick. He 
rubbed his hands together, beam- 
ing. “Now, what else is left?” He 
looked around the room. “Wenzl, 
move one of those typewriters so 
that Fritz has one to use. And 
some of the work, also, on this 
side — not too much for Fritz, 
I’m sure Emma works much 
faster! Good, good.” He started to 
leave, followed by Wenzl and the 
young keeper. “Until next time, 
then, Emma, Fritz!” 

The door closed. 

F T'HE biped made as if to sit 
down at his desk. At his first 
movement Emma flinched back, 
jaw gaping in fright, hands over 
her knob. This startled the biped, 
who said irritably, “I’m not going 
to hurt you.” 

“Don’t speak to me,” the fe- 
male said faintly. She clutched 
her knob. Her body was tremb- 
ling all over, slightly but per- 
ceptibly. 

The biped, trying to ignore her 



34 



GALAXY 



involuntary starts and shrieks, 
moved to the desk and sat down. 
He took the cover off his ma- 
chine, looked at the heap of dic- 
taphone spools in the in basket, 
then opened the desk drawer and 
quickly glanced inside to make 
sure his letter was there. By this 
time, the female was in the door- 
way of her room, poised for fur- 
ther flight. 

Under her horrified gaze, the 
biped did not dare take his un- 
finished letter out of the drawer. 
He picked up the first dictaphone 
spool, inserted it in the machine, 
put the earphones on his head 
and began to listen. 

A sudden loud noise in his 
ears made him jump and tear 
off the earphones. After a mo- 
ment he turned down the volume 
and cautiously tried again. A 
voice was speaking faintly; he 
recognized it as Griick’s, but 
could not make out the words. 
He turned the spool back to 
“start.” The abrupt sound came 
again, and this time he realized 
that it was Griick clearing his 
throat. 

He turned up the volume. 
Griick’s voice was saying, “At- 
tention, Emma! Here is tape 
number two of Some Aspects of 
Extra-Terrestrial Biology. Begin. 
Bibliography. Birney, R. C. Bay- 
ee-air-en-eh-ipsilon, Emma. Phy- 
lum and genus in the Martian

physiology, 1985, 50, 162 to 167. 
Bulev, M. I. Bay-oo-ell-eh-fow,

again, as last time! A preliminary 
study of natator veneris schultzii.

1652 to 1653. Cooper, J. G. .” 

The biped irritably removed 
the earphones and switched off 
the machine. The earphones did 
not press hard on his small ex- 
ternal ears, but they felt unfamil- 
iar and made him nervous. 

The female had moved out a 
few steps from her doorway, but 
when he glanced up, she backed 
away hastily. 

The biped swore. After a mo- 
ment, reluctantly, he turned the 
dictaphone spool back to the be- 
ginning and put the earphones on 
again. He rolled paper into the 
typewriter carriage, then switched 
on the dictaphone and began try- 
ing to type as he listened. But in 
the first few words he typed there 
were so many errors that he 
ripped the paper out and threw 
it in the wastebasket. 

There was a stifled shriek 
from the female, who had ad- 
vanced halfway across the room. 
Clutching her knob, she re- 
treated two steps. 

“Don’t look at me!” she piped. 

“Then don’t shriek,” said the 
biped, annoyed. He rolled an- 
other sheet into the machine. 

“I wouldn’t shriek, if you only 
wouldn’t look at me.” 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



35 



He glanced up. “How can I 
help looking at you if you 
shriek?” 

Except for another piping 
sound, more a gasp than a 
scream, she made no reply. The 
biped went back to work. Touch- 
ing one key at a time with pain- 
ful care, he managed to get 
through five entries in the bibli- 
ography before making an error. 

He threw the pages away and 
started over once more. 

T'lME passed. At length he was 
aware that the female had 
crossed the room to her desk. He 
concentrated on his work, and 
did not look up. After a few 
minutes, he heard the clatter of 
her machine. Her typing was 
smooth and rapid; the carriage 
banged against the stop, banged 
back, and reeled off another line. 

Angrily, the biped hit a key 
too hard and it repeated. He 
ripped the page out. 

“You are spoiling all your 
work,” she said. 

He glanced up — her hands 
leaped to her knob — he looked 
down again. “I can’t help it if I 
am,” he said. 

“Weren’t you taught to type 
properly?” 

“No. I mean yes.” The biped 
clenched his three-fingered fists 
in frustration. “I know how to 
type, but this animal doesn’t. I 
can’t make his hands work.” 



She stared at him with her 
mouth slightly open. It was plain 
that she did not understand a 
word. 

The biped growled angrily and 
went back to his work. After a 
moment he heard the clatter of 
Emma’s machine begin again. 

For a long time neither spoke. 
Keeping at it grimly, in the next 
hour the biped managed to com- 
plete a page. He took it from 
the machine and put it into his 
out basket with a feeling of tri- 
umph. Glancing over at the fe- 
male’s desk, he was a little dis- j 
concerted to note that her out 
basket was heaped with type- 
script and dictaphone spools, : 
while her in basket was empty. 

His back and his hands ached 
from the unaccustomed work. He 
felt weary and dejected again. 
How was he going to finish the 
letter, the all-important letter, I 
while the female was constantly 
in the same room? Perhaps if he i 
deliberately frightened her once 
again . 

The thought ended as he heard 
the outer door open. Emma 
looked up expectantly. The clat- j 
ter of her machine ceased. She 
covered the machine in two deft , 
movements and stood up. 

In walked Griick, beaming and 
nodding; then Wenzl, grim as 
ever; finally the pimply keeper 
with his cart. 

Griick’s expression changed 



36

slightly when he glanced at the 
biped. 

“Please!” he ejaculated, making 
upward motions with his fat 
hands. Belatedly realizing what 
was meant, the biped got up and 
stood at attention beside his desk, 
as Emma was doing beside hers. 

“Good!” cried Griick happily. 
“Excellent! You see, Fritz, a little 
politeness, and everything is bet- 
ter.” He turned to Emma, ex- 
amined the contents of her out 
basket, beaming with approval. 
“Fine, Emma, good work. Emma 
shall have three bonbons with her 
dinner! You hear, Rudi?” 

“Very good, Herr Doktor,” said 
the keeper, with a bow. He put 
three large lumps of some dry- 
looking, pale green substance on 
a plate which already contained 
a sort of gray-brown stew, and 
carried it into Emma’s room. 
When he returned, Griick was 
staring at the biped’s out basket 
with an expression of hurt dis- 
belief. 

“Fritz, can this be all?” asked 
Griick. “For a whole morning’s 
work? Surely you can’t be so 
lazy!” 

The biped muttered, “I did the 
best I could.” 

Griick shook his head sadly. 
“No bonbons for Fritz today, 
Karl. What a shame, eh, Wenzl? 
Poor Fritz has earned no bon- 
bons. We are sorry for Fritz. But 
to give him bonbons for such 



work would not be fair to Emma, 
who works hard! Correct, 
Wenzl?” 

Wenzl, fixing the biped with a 
cold and unregretful stare, said 
nothing. Griick went on, “But this 
afternoon, if there is an improve- 
ment — well, we shall see! Until 
then—” He picked up the single 
page in the biped’s basket, 
glanced at it again, and clucked 
his tongue. “Not correct! Not cor- 
rect!” he said, stabbing a blunt 
finger against the page. “Here are 
mistakes, Fritz! So little work, 
and also so bad! And where . 
where are the carbon copies?” 

“No one said anything to me 
about any carbon copies,” the 
biped replied angrily. “As for the 
typewriting, I’ve told you, this 
animal’s body is unfamiliar to 
me. Let me see you type with 
somebody else’s fingers, and see 
if you do as well!” He felt a little 
dizzy, and went on shouting with- 
out caring much what happened. 
“You can take your whole 
damned Zoo, for all I care,” he 
said, shaking his fist in Griick’s 
face, “and slide down my — ” 

The room was tilting absurdly 
to the left, walls, Griick, Wenzl, 
keeper, Emma and all. He clutch- 
ed at the desk to stop it, but the 
desk treacherously sprang up and 
struck him a dull blow across the 
face. He heard Griick and the 
keeper shouting, and Emma’s 
voice piping in the background;

then he lost interest and drifted 
away into grayness. 

44T IE still,” said a fretfully 

■ Li reassuring voice. 

The biped looked up and rec- 
ognized the gigantic face of Prinz- 
metal, the surgeon. Prinzmetal’s 
large brown eyes were swimming 
over him; Prinzmetal’s soft mouth 
was twisted nervously. 

“Shock and strain,” said Prinz- 
metal over his shoulder. The 
biped could make out two or 
three other persons standing far- 
ther back in the room. He was 
lying, he now realized, on the cot 
in the back room of his cage. He 
felt curiously limp and weak. 

“It’s all right,” said Prinzmetal 
soothingly. “You lost conscious- 
ness a moment, that’s all. It could 
happen to any highly-strung crea- 
ture. Lie still, Fritz, rest a little.” 
His face turned, receded. 

Griick’s voice asked a question. 
Prinzmetal replied, “Nothing — 
he will be as good as new tomor- 
row.” Feet shuffled on the con- 
crete floor. The biped heard, more 
dimly: “It’s a good thing it isn’t 
something organic, Herr Doktor. 
What do we know about the in- 
ternal constitution of these beasts, 
after all? Nothing whatever!” 

Wenzl’s voice spoke briefly and 
dryly. “When we get a chance to 
dissect one — ” 

They were gone. The biped lay 
quietly, staring at the discolored 



ceiling. He heard the door close; 
then there was silence except for 
a faint, far-off strain of music 
from somewhere outside. No 
sound came from the inner office, 
or from Emma’s room next door. 

At length the biped got up. He 
relieved himself in the little bath- 
room, and drank some water. He 
realized that he was hungry. 

His tray was on the folding 
table near the bed. The biped sat 
down and ate the brownish-gray 
stew, then picked up one of the 
two round lumps of dry greenish 
stuff which lay at the side of the 
tray — the “bonbons” Griick had 
made so much of. The biped put 
the thing cautiously in his mouth, 
then paused incredulously. The 
lump, which was almost as dry to 
the tongue as its appearance sug- 
gested, had a subtle, delicious fla- 
vor which was utterly different 
from anything the biped had ever 
tasted before. It was not sweet, 
not salt, not bitter, not acid. His 
eyes closed involuntarily as he 
sucked at it, causing it to grow 
slowly moister and dissolve in his 
mouth. 

When it was gone he ate the 
other one, and then sat motion- 
less, eyes still closed, savoring the 
wonder of this unexpected good 
thing that had happened to him. 
Tears welled in his eyes. 

How was it possible that even 
in his captivity, and his despair, 
there should be such joy? 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



39 



T HE central building of the 
Berlin Zoo, built in 1971 by 
the architect Herbert Medius, 
was a delightful specimen of late 
20th-century architecture but had 
several irremediable defects. For 
example, the garden-roof dining 
room, used on formal occasions 
by Griick and his staff, was roofed 
with a soaring transparent dome 
into which arcs of stained glass 
had been let, and at certain times 
of the year the long, varicolored 
streaks of light from this dome, 
instead of dripping diagonally 
down the lemonwood and ebony 
walls, lay directly on the diners’ 
tables and colored what was in 
their plates. The canvas curtains 
which were supposed to cover the 
dome’s interior had never worked 
properly and were now, as usual, 
awaiting repair. Consequently, al- 
though Herr Doktor Griick’s bau- 
ernwurst and mashed potatoes 
had the rich brown and white 
tones with which they had come 
from the kitchen, Prinzmetal’s 
boeuf au jus was a dark ruby, as 
if it had been plucked raw from 
the bleeding carcass; Rausch’s 
plate was deep blue; and'Wenzl’s 
was a pure, poisonous green. The 
visitors, of course, Umrath of 
Europa-News, Purser Bang of 
the Space Service and the trustee 
Neumann, had been placed in un- 
colored areas, except that a 
wedge of the red light that 
stained Prinzmetal’s place occa- 



sionally glinted upon Neumann’s 
elbow when he lifted his fork. 

Wenzl, as always, sat stiff and 
silent at his place. 

His sardonic eye? missed noth- 
ing, neither the strained reluc- 
tance with which Rausch lifted 
his gobbets of blue meat to his 
lips, nor the exaggerated motion 
of Prinzmetal’s arm which lifted 
each forkful for an instant out of 
the sullen red light before he took 
it into his mouth. But Wenzl 
looked upon his dinner and found 
it green: he carved it methodi- 
cally with his knife in his green 
hand, forked it up green and ate 
it green. 

Umrath, the Europa-News man, 
was square and red-faced, with 
shrewd little eyes and pale lashes. 
He said, “Not a bad dinner, this. 
Compliment the chef, Herr Dok- 
tor. If this is how you feed the 
animals down there, I must say 
they live well.” 

“Feed the animals!” cried 
Griick merrily. “Ha, ha, my dear 
Umrath! No, indeed, we have our 
separate kitchen for that, I as- 
sure you! To feed more than five 
hundred different species, some 
of them not even Terrestrial, that 
is no joke, you can believe me! 
Take for instance the Brecht’s 
Bipeds. Their food must be rich 
in sulfur and in beryllium salts. 
If we put that on the table here, 
you would soon be three sick 
gentlemen!” 



40 



GALAXY 



“Wenzl would eat it and not 
turn a hair,” said Neumann, the 
aging trustee. He was quiet and 
dark, with a weary but business- 
like air about him. 

“Ha! True!” cried Griick. “Our 
Wenzl is made of cast iron! But 
the bipeds, gentlemen, not so. 
They are delicate! They require 
constant care!” 

“And money,” put in Neumann 
dryly, picking with his fork at the 
meat on his plate, which he had 
hardly touched. 

“It’s true,” said Griick soberly. 
“They are rarities, and they come 
from eighteen light-years away. 
One doesn’t go eighteen light- 
years for a picnic, eh, Purser 
Bang?” 

There was a rustling sound 
from the corner, which distracted 
the diners’ attention for a mo- 
ment. Heads turned. Out of the 
dimness scuttled something small 
and many-legged, with skin of a 
sparkling pale blue. It turned 
upon them the jeweled flash of 
its tiny red eyes, then was gone 
into a hole in the wainscoting. 
The diners looked after it with- 
out comment. 

The spaceman nodded. He was 
tall and taciturn, lantern- jawed, 
and looked more like a door- 
keeper than an intrepid adven- 
turer. He cut precise cubes from 
the meat on his plate and chewed 
them thoroughly before swallow- 
ing. 



“Why spend so much for bi- 
peds, then, Griick?” Umrath de- 
manded. “They’re amusing, I sup- 
pose, in their way, but are they 
worth it?” 

“My dear Umrath,” said Griick, 
laying down his fork in turn, “I 
must tell you, the bipeds repre- 
sent the dream of my life. Yes, I 
confess, it’s true that I dream! 
After all, we are alive to do some- 
thing in the world, to achieve 
something! That is why, dear Um- 
rath, I schemed and wrote letters 
for five years, and why I traded 
two Altairan altar birds and how 
much money to boot I had better 
not mention — ” he glanced at 
Neumann, who smiled faintly — 
“for our wonderful new biped 
Fritz. He is here, he is well, and 
he is a mature male. We already 
have our female biped Emma. No 
other zoo on Earth has more than 
one. Laugh at me if you will, but 
it shall be Griick, and his Berlin 
Zoo, who is remembered as the 
first man to breed bipeds in cap- 
tivity!” 

“Some say it can’t be done,” 
put in Umrath. 

“Yes, I know it!” cried Griick 
gaily. “Never have bipeds been 
successfully bred in captivity, not 
even on Brecht’s Planet! And why 
not? Because until now no one 
has successfully reproduced the 
essential conditions of their nat- 
ural environment!” 

“And those conditions are — ?” 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



41 



asked Neumann with weary 
courtesy. 

“That we shall discover!” said 
Griick. “Trust me, gentlemen, I 
have made already a collection 
of writings about Brecht’s Planet 
and especially the bipeds. There 
is no larger one in the Galacti- 
cum, not even excepting the Ber- 
lin Archive!” He beamed. “And 
between ourselves, gentlemen, 
Purser Bang has a connection 
with a group on Brecht’s Planet 
who are able to make physiologi- 
cal studies of the bipeds! Depend 
on it, they will give us valuable 
information — by way of Purser 
1 Bang, our good friend!” He 
reached over and patted Bang’s 
sleeve affectionately. The space- 
man half-smiled, blinked and 
went on eating. 

“Well then, here’s to the bi- 
peds!” said Umrath, lifting his 
wineglass. * 

Griick, Prinzmetal, Rausch and 
Bang drank; Neumann merely 
raised his glass and set it down 
again. Wenzl, coldly upright, went 
on methodically cutting and eat- 
ing his green meat. 

“All the same,” said Neumann 
after a moment, “it seems to me 
that a good deal depends on 
Fritz.” 

V 

i"kN the morning of this eleventh 
^ day in the store, the young 
man climbed down as usual, very 



early, when the great vault was 
almost empty. Once or twice 
someone glanced at him curiously 
as he passed down the aisles, but 
he kept walking, and no one 
spoke to him. The clerks were 
busy behind the walls of glass 
cases, inserting new merchandise, 
clicking the metal doors open and 
shut; the cleaners in their gray- 
striped uniforms were pushing 
their whining machines along the 
floor. Voices echoed lonesomely 
under the distant ceiling. 

The young man quenched his 
thirst at the drinking fountain be- 
tween the grocery and the art 
gallery. Then he went into the 
produce section, with its moun- 
tains of fruit under glass, for his 
breakfast. By this time the out- 
side^ doors had been opened, the 
music was playing, and people 
were beginning to stream down 
the aisles. The young man spent 
seventy pfennigs for a trans- 
parent bag of oranges and a pack- 
age of bananas. Alternately eating 
the bananas and sucking the or- 
anges, he wandered through the 
store. When he finished a piece 
of fruit, he tucked the peel neatly 
into the bag under his arm. 

Once, on the evening of his 
second day, the young man had 
ventured out into the avenue 
again, but the crowds, the noise 
and the lights had disturbed him 
and he had gone back into the 
store almost immediately, afraid 



42

he would be outside when it 
; closed its doors. To be inside was 
j much better. Here there was also 
noise, but it was of a different 
quality, not so alarming. The light 
i was even and cool, and did not 
; hurt his eyes. And besides, in the 
; store he found all he needed — 
food, drink, entertainment. Some- 
times he became lost, the store 
, was so large. But he could always 
find his way again by following 
the moving rocket-trails of light 
on the ceiling. 

Whenever he saw one of the 
blue-uniformed men, he looked 
straight ahead until he was past. 
He had learned that the men in 
blue would not pursue him unless 
he climbed the grille or took 
i something from a case without 
paying, and now he always made 
sure to pay. As for the grille, he 
climbed it every night, not being 
able to find any other way up. 
Twice more he had been noticed, 
and the men in blue had run and 
shouted, ringing their bells; but 
no one could climb after him. So 
he was not really very afraid of 
the blue-uniformed men. But he 
did not like to be near them, all 
the same. 

There were still some discom- 
forts in his new body that con- 
stantly worried him and occasion- 
ally even alarmed him by their 
intensity. There was something 
his mouth and throat wanted to 
do, for example. He kept trying 



different kinds of food and drink, 
and the feeling always went 
away, but it came back after- 
ward. Dark, curly hair was 
sprouting all over his cheeks and 
chin, and it made his face itch. 
Nevertheless, he was getting 
along much better than he had 
at first. He had found out that 
taking his clothes and shoes off at 
night made them easier to bear 
the next day. When his under- 
clothes had become dirty yester- 
day, he had bought new ones out 
of a machine, and he discovered 
now that the smooth, clean fab- 
ric was unexpectedly pleasant 
against his bald skin. 

Without watching where his 
feet were leading him, he had 
wandered into the women’s cloth- 
ing section. In the middle of the 
central open space, a crowd had 
gathered around a platform. The 
young man went nearer. On the 
platform a perspiring dark- 
skinned man was energetically 
looping a wide ribbon of violet 
cloth around a blonde young 
woman who stood passively, arms 
raised, and stared out into space. 

Both man and woman had the 
bright, unreal colors and the curi- 
ous black outlines of the cinema 
he had seen on his first day, and 
he realized that this was another 
illusion. The man and woman 
were not really there. 

The cloth took shape, became 
a dress. The dark-skinned man 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



43 




ran a piece of metal up the wom- 
an’s side, pinching out the cloth 
into a ridge and tightening the 
dress to her body. Then he did 
the same thing to the other side, 
touched the dress swiftly here 
and there, cut a slit halfway down 
the back and began to work the 
finished dress up over the wom- 
an’s head. Underneath, her body 
was shapely and cream-skinned 
in two brief garments of dark 
blue lace. Looking at her made 
the young man feel peculiar, and 
one of his discomforts suddenly 
became much more acute. 

HTHE young man did not like it. 

As he turned to work his way 
out of the crowd, he came face to 
face with a dark-haired, pale- 
skinned young woman who first 
looked startled, then smiled hap- 
pily. “Martin!” she said, taking 
his arm. 



The young man moved away 
nervously. “I don’t know you, 
madam,” he said. 

“What?” The woman’s face 
changed. The young man kept on 
moving away. She took a step 
after him. “Martin Naumchik — ” 
Thoroughly alarmed, the 
young man turned and dived into 
the nearest hole in the crowd. He 
worked his way around the plat- 
form, turning his head frequently 
to see if he was being followed. 
Above him, the dark-skinned man 
was turning the dress inside out. 
When he finished, he poised it 
over the young woman’s shoul- 
ders, then began to work it down 
over her body. Both seemed to 
revolve as he circled them. No 
matter how far around he got, 
he could never see their backs. 

The young man left the crowd 
cautiously on the opposite side, 
and looked around. The dark- 

GALAXY 



haired woman was not in sight. 
Nevertheless, he took a compli- 
cated route out of that part of 
the store, glancing back many 
times. 

Crossing the elevator plaza, he 
saw people looking at him, and 
realized he had been shaking his 
head unconsciously as he walked. 
The encounter with the dark- 
haired woman had taken him 
completely by surprise. It had 
somehow never occurred to him 
before that as a human being he 
now had not only a name and 
clothing, personal possessions and 
so on, but also friends and ac- 
quaintances. The idea frightened 
the young man. What could he 
possibly say to these people? 
What would they expect of him? 

The comfort and safety of his 
refuge in the store began to seem 
illusory. For a moment he 
thought wistfully of his clean, 
bare little cubicle in the Hamburg 
Zoo. But the memory was already 
so faded and distant that it could 
not occupy his attention long. The 
reality was this gigantic, glittering 
room with its unending murmur 
of voices, its exciting smells, its 
clicking elevators, its rocket-trails 
of red, green, amber, blue that 
traveled in pulses across the ceil- 
ing. 

The best thing might be to go 
away, change his name perhaps, 
find a place to live in some other 
city where he was not known. But 



he had no confidence that he 
could manage such a trip proper- 
ly. Were there stores such as this 
in other cities than Berlin? He 
was humiliated to realize that he 
did not know. He had lived in 
Hamburg for twelve years, but 
had no idea what lay beyond the 
Zoo grounds. Other cities were 
only names to him. 

A N hour later, up in the third- 
floor lunchroom, he was still 
thinking about it over buns and 
coffee. It was his first experiment 
with coffee. The flavor was un- 
expected and rather unpleasant, 
but he liked its sweetness and 
warmth. 

It was odd how differently he 
felt about foods now that he was 
a human being. He had been go- 
ing cautiously, since his bad ex- 
perience of the first night in the 
restaurant. He had eaten only 
fruits and bread, and sometimes 
a sausage on a roll. But in time 
he expected to do all things hu- 
man beings did, even to eating 
the wet brown messes he saw on 
his neighbors’ plates. 

He picked up his cup, experi- 
mentally flexed the muscles of 
his lips and drank. He was proud 
of this accomplishment, which 
had cost him much effort. 

The last few drops rattled 
noisily as they went in, and one 
or two people nearby glanced at 
him with raised eyebrows. Evi- 



44 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



45 



dently this was not a sound that 
one made. He set down the cup 
in some embarrassment, and con- 
sulted his wristwatch: it was just 
eleven. 

He restrained himself from 
checking the time by his other 
wristwatch, which was in his 
pocket. He had observed that hu- 
man beings did not wear two at 
once, perhaps because the 
watches were so accurate that no 
checking was required. 

A pattern of bright lights 
flashed for an instant on his sec- 
tion of the counter. He glanced 
upward automatically, as he had 
done the time before, and the 
time before that, and saw only a 
fading starflower of red sparks 
in the machine overhead. They 
dimmed and went out. A moment 
later they flashed on again, mak- 
ing him blink and jerk his head 
back. The bright chrome and 
glass ring of the revolving dis- 
play case slowed, stopped. Di- 
rectly in front of him, a square 
black hole appeared, and a trans- 
parency lighted up. The young 
man read,' “EMPTY PLATES, 
PLEASE.” He pushed his empty 
cup and saucer, and the plate 
with the remnants of his buns, 
obediently into the hole, which 
closed- on it with a metallic snap. 
The transparency blinked, shim- 
mered, and lighted up again: 
“THANK YOU.” 

With a warm feeling for the 



polite machine, the young man! 
stood up and left the lunchroom, 
As he passed the entrance, where 
a crowd was waiting to get in, he 
found himself once more face to 
face with the same dark-haired 
young woman. 

She stared at him, apparently! 
as shocked as he was. Neither 
moved for an instant. Then the 
young woman, without a word, 
raised her hand and slapped him 
in the face. 

The blow was so unexpected 
and painful that the young man 
was unable to move for a few 
moments longer, while the young 
woman turned and walked away 
People standing around wen 
staring at him; some where whis, 
pering to each other. 

No one had ever struck him 
before. With one hand to the 
curious numbness that was the 
pain in his cheek, the young man 
turned away. 

He spent the rest of the day 
wandering the store half-blindly, 
shivering a little. His pleasure in 
the bright colors and varied 
shapes around him was dimmed 
almost to extinction. He was wait- 
ing for it to be time for him to 
climb to his hideaway in the 
tower. Beyond that he did not 
think. 

T^VENTUALLY it was eigh 
teen-thirty. The crowds wen 
beginning to flow toward the 



exits. The young man moved 
across the elevator plaza, vaguely 
aware that the crowds were heav- 
ier and somehow more anxious 
than usual tonight. He passed a 
man with a camera, then another. 
Two in a row. He had sometimes 
amused himself by counting men 
with cameras, or fat woman, or 
crying children, but now he had 
no interest in games. There were 
a lot of uniforms in sight, too: 
not only the blue store police, but 
white uniforms, red ones, gold- 
and-white ones . 

He passed two blue-uniformed 
men who were standing together, 
looking intently around them. 
One stepped forward, glancing at 
the young man, then at some- 
thing he held in his hand. “One 
moment, sir.” 

The young man sidestepped, 
anxious not to be touched again. 

“Stop!” cried the store police- 
man, reaching. 

The young man whirled and 
ran for the grille. Bells were ring- 
ing on all sides; footsteps pound- 
ing after him. He sprang, caught 
the grille, began to climb. 

Halfway up, he glanced back. 
No one was climbing after him, 
but there was a great deal of 
activity at the base of the grille. 
Blue-uniformed men were clus- 
tered around a bundle of some- 
thing gray, unrolling it. There 
were others, in gleaming white 
uniforms, with feathers on their 



hats: but these were not doing 
anything, only standing with feet 
apart, staring up at him. 

He went on climbing. As he 
neared the top of the grille, two 
heads appeared over the edge, 
then a third. 

The young man paused. The 
three men wore blue uniform caps 
— they were store police, not 
merely the clerks who lived in 
this upper level. While he was 
wondering what to do, the three 
heads ducked out of sight, then 
reappeared. The shoulders and 
arms of the three men came into 
view. Something cloudy and gray 
seemed to float down toward him. 

The young man ducked, but it 
was too late. The cloudy thing 
settled around him with a solid 
thump, and he discovered that it 
was a net of grayish cord. It 
pulled tight around him when he 
attempted to swing away to the 
side. There were ropes attached 
to the net, and the men above 
were holding them. 

Panicked, the young man tried 
to climb down. The ropes held 
him back, then slackened a little; 
but when he paused to try to re- 
move the net with one hand, they 
tightened again. 

Down below, two men in gray- 
striped uniforms were pushing up 
a sort of tall ladder on wheels. 
The plaza was full of motionless 
people now, and the men in 
white were keeping them back. 



46 



G A L A XI 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



47 



The ladder was in position al- 
most directly under him, and 
now a white-uniformed man be- 
gan to climb it. 

The young man saw that in 
another moment all his chances 
would be gone. Taking a deep 
breath, he swung himself violent- 
ly away from the grille, tearing 
with both hands at the net that 
held him. 

The great room revolved mas- 
sively around him. His back 
struck the grille hard, knocking 
the breath out of him. He kicked 
himself away again, still tearing 
wildly at the meshes of the net. 
The man on the ladder was very 
near. The net gave a little; he 
had found an edge. His head was 
out, then his shoulders. 

The grille struck him again. 
The man on the ladder leaned 
out and reached for him. Then 
he was falling. 

VI 

S PRAWLED on the couch in 
his room, the biped read: 
“The bipeds of the Great 
Northern Plateau, although the 
most interesting life-form on 
Brecht’s Planet, are a vanishing 
species. Their once numerous 
herds are no longer seen in the 
vicinity of the Earth settlements. 
Only scattered groups of three to 
five are occasionally met in the 
mountains and foothills to the 



north. These animals, prior to the 
development of Brecht’s Planet 
by man, possessed a complex; 
herd organization and communi- 
cated by vocal signals. Their mat- 
ing ceremonies, held in the spring 
of the year, are said to have in- 
volved barbaric cruelties to the 
females.” 

He closed the book thought- 
fully. That might account partly 
for Emma’s attitude, he supposed 
— if she had witnessed something 
of the kind before being captured 
and brought to Earth as an in-s 
fant. However — 

He thumbed the book open at 
a different place. “The knob or; 
crest,” he read, “appearing only! 
as a vestige in the male, is a con-j 
spicuous purplish-red ovoid in the 
female. The function of the crestl 
is unknown, but it is thought to 
be a secondary sexual character- 
istic. Erhardt (6) has suggested 
that it functions as an organ of 
display in the animals’ natural 
state, but Zimmer (7) has pro- 
nounced it to be merely a hyper- 
trophied pineal eye. The organ is 
vulnerable, as attested by the 
large number of older females 
who have lost it through accident 
or in conflict with other bipeds.' 

The biped closed the book 
again and tossed it irritably onto 
the floor. He was reading Brecht’s 
Planet: Riddle of the Universe 
for the second time, out of sheet 
boredom, since it was the only 



book he had in the back room: 
but the parts that were full of 
footnote references reminded him 
too much of the work he copied 
every day for Griick and the 
other staff members. 

In another two hours or so it 
would be closing time, and he 
could go into the living room 
without exposing himself to all 
those meaty red faces. This time 
he would remember to bring 
some reading matter into the 
back room, enough to last him a 
few days. 

Actually, there was nothing to 
stop him from going out there 
now . there were some maga- 
zines in the rack, he remembered, 
with bright covers. He could 
scoop them up and come straight 
back in. But he hesitated to make 
the move. 

It was extraordinary how hate- 
ful a row of human faces could 
be, staring in at you over an iron 
railing, with their great fat jaws 
moving as they chewed. 

He stood up restlessly. Hell 
and damnation! There was noth- 
ing to do here except read 
Brecht’s Planet again, and noth- 
ing to do in the office. His work 
was all cleaned up, and there was 
no point in trying to smuggle out 
another letter until he found out 
what had happened to the first 
one. 

Anxiety seized him again, and 
he began pacing back and forth. 



Surely nothing could have gone 
wrong? 

When the first batch of signed 
correspondence had come down 
from “upstairs” to be folded and 
sealed in envelopes, the biped 
had simply added his to the pile. 
Rudi, the pimply young keeper, 
had carried them out on his next 
trip. There was no reason to sup- 
pose that stamped, sealed letters 
were inspected by Griick or any- 
one. The keeper probably took 
them directly to the post box. 

But he had been waiting for a 
week. If Stein had received the 
letter, why hadn’t something hap- 
pened before now? 

T?ROM Emma’s living room 
next door he heard a faint 
creak, a pause, another creak. 
Probably she had got up from 
her chair for something, then sat 
down again ... all in full view of 
the crowd, naturally. 

That decided him. He looked 
at the open doorway, then stiff- 
ened himself and walked through 
it, looking straight ahead. 

The first moment was even 
worse than he had expected. The 
room was enormous and empty; 
the window was crowded with 
faces. He tried to shut them out 
of his awareness, looking only at 
the magazines, which now seemed 
much less attractive than he had 
remembered them. After a mo- 
ment it began to be easier to go 



48

on than to turn back, but his 
mouth was still dry and his heart 
thumped painfully. Outside, there 
was a steady movement along 
the railing as people who had 
been staring at Emma came over 
to stare at him. 

Walking stiffly, the biped 
reached the relaxing chair and 
leaned past it to get the maga- 
zines. Be natural, he ordered him- 
self. Pick up the magazines, 
turn . 

Outside the wall of glass, peo- 
ple were waving to attract his at- 
tention. There were cries of “Ah, 
just look!” and “Fritz, hello!” A 
blond child, carried on his fath- 
er’s shoulder so as to see better, 
turned suddenly beet-red and be- 
gan to cry. Several people were 
aiming cameras. Through the up- 
roar, just as he turned away, the 
biped thought he heard his name 
called. 

He turned incredulously. 

In the front line of the crowd, 
wedged in between two fat ma- 
trons, was a medium-sized man 
in a gray surcoat with a wad of 
paper in his hand. His eyes, 
friendly and inquisitive, were 
looking straight into the biped’s. 
His mouth moved, and once 
more the biped thought he heard 
his name spoken, but the noise 
was so great that he could not be 
sure. 

The man in gray smiled slight- 
ly, raised his wad of paper, then 



wrote something on it with care- 
ful, firm motions. He held the 
papei* up. On it was lettered, 
“ARE YOU NAUMCHIK?” 

The biped felt a rush of joy 
and gratitude that almost choked 
him. He fell against the glass, 
nodding vehemently and point- 
ing to himself. “I am Naumchik!”! 
he shouted. 

The man in gray nodded re- 
assuringly, folded up his paper 
and tucked it away. With a wave 
of his hand, he turned and began 
to struggle out of the crowd. 

“Fritz! Fritz!” yelled all the 
red faces. 

r T'HE BIPED waited, pacing up 
and down, for twenty min- 
utes by the big office clock, and 
still nothing happened. He knew 
he should control his impatience, 
that the gray man might be up- 
stairs at this moment, arguing for 
his release; but it was no use, he 
had to do something or burst. 

He eyed the telephone. He 
had been forbidden to use it ex- 
cept for routine calls in connec- 
tion with his work. But to the 
devil with that! The biped strode 
to the phone, swung out the lis- 
tening unit. The call light began 
to pulse. After a moment the 
voice of the switchboard girl 
spoke faintly from the instru- 
ment: “Please?” 

“This is Martin Naumchik,” 
said the biped, feeling as he 



50 



GALAXY 



spoke that the words sounded 
subtly false. “I want to speak to 
Dr. Griick. Please connect me 
with him.” 

“Who did you say you are?” 
“Martin — ” the biped began, 
and swallowed. “All right then, 
never mind, this is Fritz the 

biped. I want to speak — ” 

“Why didn’t you say so in the 
first place? Is there anything 

wrong with the work?” 

“No, the work is finished. It’s 
something quite urgent, so if you 
will kindly — ■” 

“Is anything wrong in the 

cage?” 

“No, but I must speak to 

Griick. Look here, whatever your 
name is, kindly don’t argue and 
just let me speak to — ” 

“My name is Fraiilein Muller,” 
her voice broke in coldly, “and I 
have instructions not to let the 
animals make personal telephone 
calls. So if there is no emergency, 
and nothing wrong with your 
work — ” 

“I tell you it’s urgent!” howled 
the biped. With mounting fury, 
he went on shouting into the 
mouthpiece. “You idiotic woman, 
if you prevent me from speaking 
to Griick, there will be an ac- 
counting, I promise you! Make 
that connection at once, or — 
Hello? Do you hear me? Hello, 
Fraiilein Miiller, hello?” 

The empty hum of the line an- 
swered him. 



With shaking fingers, the biped 
closed the instrument and then 
yanked it open again. The call 
light pulsed, and went on pulsing. 

The female’s greenish, wide- 
jawed head was visible beyond 
her doorframe as the biped 
turned. “Well, what are you star- 
ing at?” he shouted. The head 
vanished. 

The biped sat down abruptly 
in his desk chair, kneading his 
three-fingered hands nervously 
together. It was intolerable to be 
shut up like this now, just when 
his freedom was perhaps so near. 
If something was about to hap- 
pen, the least they could do was 
to let him know, not leave him in 
the dark like this. After all, whose 
life was at stake? But that was 
always the way with these in- 
flated bureaucrats, they couldn’t 
see past their own fat noses. Let 
the lower ranks wait and worry 
for nothing. What did they care? 

Oh, but just let him get out, 
and then! What an expose he 
would write! What a series! 
Shocking Inhumanity of Zoo 
Keepers! His nervousness, which 
had abated a little, increased 
again and he sprang to his feet. 
Let him once get out, that was 
all — just let him get out! The 
rest would not matter so much, 
even if he were condemned . 

He paused to listen. Yes, there 
came the sound again. The door 
was opening. 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



51 



HTHE biped ran to the passage; 

but it was not Griick or the 
man in gray, only Rudi with his 
little cart. 

“Oh, you,” said the biped, turn- 
ing away dully. 

“Yes, me,” Rudi answered with 
spirit. “Who else should it be, I’d 
like to know? Who does all the 
hard work around here, and gets 
no thanks for it?” He pushed his 
cart into the office space, grum- 
bling all the time, without look- 
ing at the biped. “Does Herr Dok- 
tor Griick feed the rhino, or the 
thunderbirds? Who pokes the 
meat down the boa constrictor’s 
throat with a broomstick, Wenzl? 
Does Rausch swamp out the 
monkeys’ cages, or is it me? You 
bipeds are not so bad, at least 
you clean up after yourselves, but 
some of these beasts, you 
wouldn’t believe how filthy they 
are! They throw things on the 
floor, they let themselves go just 
where they feel like it . Well, 
that’s life. Some live on the fat 
of the land, and others have to 
work up to their elbows in mon- 
key dirt.” With a scowl, he took 
a small object off his cart and 
threw it onto the nearest desk. 
“There’s some soap for you. 
You’re to clean yourself up and 
be interviewed, and the order is 
to hurry. So don’t be late, mind, 
or I’ll get the blame, not you.” 

The biped’s heart began pound- 
ing violently. “Did you say inter- 



viewed?” he stammered. “Who — 
what?” 

“Interviewed, is all I know. ‘ 
Some newspaperman wants to 
write a story about you. All lies, 

I dare say, but that’s his look- 
out.” Rudi was wheeling his cart 
around, still without glancing at 
the biped. 

There was a sound behind 
them, and the biped turned in 
time to see Emma come darting 
nervously out of her doorway. 

“Rudi,” she piped. “Oh, Rudi — 
please wait!” 

But the keeper had disap- 
peared into the passage, and ei- I 
ther did not hear or did not 
choose to turn back. After a mo- | 
ment came the sound of the outer [ 
door closing. 

Emma retreated toward her | 
room as the biped turned, her 
hands going to her head in the 
familiar gesture. But she paused 
when she saw him reach for the | 
small packet on the desk. 

“Is that soap?” she asked tim- 
idly. “I heard him say it was.” 

The biped picked up the small 
paper-wrapped oblong. It had a 
faint aromatic scent which was 
oddly disturbing. “Soap, yes,” he 
said abstractedly. “I’ve got to get 
cleaned up so that I can be 
interviewed.” 

“I had some once,” the female 
said, edging nearer. “It was a long 
time ago. They said it was bad 
for me.” 



52 



GALAXY 



“I suppose so,” the biped mut- 
tered, tearing at the paper with 
his blunt fingers. The paper rip- 
ped open, the soap shot out be- 
tween his hands and clattered 
across the floor almost to Emma’s 
feet. She bent slowly and picked 
it up. The fragrance had grown 
almost overpoweringly strong. 

“Give it to me, will you?” the 
biped asked impatiently, walking 
nearer. He was at the scuffed 
chalk line that divided his side 
of the room from hers, but she 
took no notice. With the soap 
clutched in both hands, she was 
intently sniffing. Her mouth was 
half open, her eyes turned up. 

The biped took a step across 
the line. Still she did not respond. 

Alarmed, the biped halted and 
stared at her. “Emma!” he said. 

Her head turned. “Yes?” she 
said in a dreamy voice. 

“What’s the matter with you, 
Emma?” 

“Nothing matter,” she replied, 
with a vacuous grin. 

“Well then, give me the soap 
if you please” 

“Good soap,” she said, nodding, 
but she did not move to hand it 
over, and seemed almost unaware 
that she was still holding it close 
to her face. 

the point of crossing the 
^ line to take it from her, the 
biped hesitated. It suddenly 
struck him as rather odd that 



Rudi should have given him soap 
to wash with at all. He had not 
seen any in his week’s incarcera- 
tion, and had not really missed it. 
Was soap good for this body, with 
its feathery spines? But if not, 
then why — ? 

Shaking his head irritably, he 
moved backward, away from the 
fascinating smell that came from 
the thing Emma was holding. 
With that insistent odor in his 
nostrils it was hard to think con- 
nectedly. 

He concentrated. At last: 
“Why did they say soap was bad 
for you, Emma?” he demanded. 

“Bad for me,” she agreed, sway- 
ing as if to inaudible music. “Soap 
bad for Emma. No more soap, 
too bad. Beautiful soap.” 

As the biped stared at her si- 
lently, he heard the door opening 
again. His dulled brain began to 
work quickly once more. “Emma, 
listen to me,” he whispered. “Take 
your soap and go into your own 
room. Understand? Go into your 
own room. Don’t come out till I 
tell you!” 

“Emma not come out.” With 
exasperating slowness, she moved 
toward the door as Rudi came 
back in, this time without his 
cart. 

“Ready, are you?” he asked, 
with a glance at Emma’s disap- 
pearing figure. 

The biped turned to face him, 
trying to look as dreamy and dis- 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



53 



tant as Emma had. “All ready,” 
he said slowly. 

“Know who you are, do you?” 
“My name is Naum — ” 

“No, no,” Rudi interrupted, 
“don’t be stupid, your name is 
Fritz. Now say it after me. ‘My 
name is Fritz.’ ” 

“Name is Fritz,” said the biped 
agreeably. He kept his eyes rolled 
up, and swayed on his feet. His 
head was buzzing with angry sur- 
mise, but he kept his voice blur- 
red and slow. 

“That’s all right, then,” Rudi 
said, satisfied. “How much is two 
and two, Fritz?” 

The biped pretended to con- 
sider the question at length. 
“Four?” he asked hesitantly. 

“Good fellow. Now how much 
is four and four and four and 
four?” 

The biped blinked slowly. 
“Four and four,” he said. 

Rudi smiled. “All right then, 
come along. You’re going upstairs 
to meet some nice gentlemen, 
Fritz, and if you behave yourself 
— mind, I said if! — I’ll give you 
something tasty all for yourself.” 
He took the biped’s arm. 

'T'HEY rode up in the elevator, 
walked along the glass-walled 
corridor overlooking the Zoo 
grounds. It was a sunny late 
afternoon, and the gravel paths 
were full of strolling people. A 
few faces tilted to watch them, 



but there was not much excite- 
ment. They entered the main 
building, Rudi opened a door, 
and the biped found himself be- 
ing ushered into the same oak- 
paneled office where he had been 
received on the first day. Beside 
the desk, Griick, Wenzl and the 
man in the gray surcoat were 
waiting. 

“Ha!” said Griick jovially, 
“here is our Fritz at last. Now we 
shall see, my dear Tassen, how 
much truth there is in this fan- 
tastic story. We could have begun 
sooner, but our Fritz sometimes 
dirties himself, not so, Wenzl? 
Too bad, but what can one ex- 
pect? So!” He rubbed his hands 
together. “Fritz, you are well?” 
“Very well, Herr Doktor,” said 
the biped. 

“Excellent! And you have eat- 
en a good supper, Fritz?” 

“Yes, Herr Doktor.” 

Griick frowned slightly, glanc- 
ing at Rudi, but in a moment col- 
lected himself and addressed the 
biped again: “Very good, Fritz. 
Now then, this gentleman is Herr 
Tassen of the Freie Presse. He 
will ask you some questions, and 
you will answer correctly. Under- 
stood? Then begin, Herr Tassen!” 
The man in the gray surcoat 
looked at the biped with a faintly 
uncertain expression. “Well then, 
Fritz — ” he began. 

The biped took a step forward, 
away from Rudi, and said quick- 



54 



GALAXY 



ly, “How long have you worked 
for the Freie Presse?” 

Tassen’s eyebrows went up. “A 
little over a year, why?” 

“Do you know Zellini, the re- 
write man?” 

“How is this?” cried Griick, 
coming forward, red-faced with 
astonishment and anger. “Fritz, 
your manners! Remember — ” 
“Yes, I know Zellini,” said the 
newsman. He was scribbling rap- 
idly on his wad of paper. 

“A little dark man, nearly bald. 
I sat next to him at the last Euro- 
pean Journalists’ Dinner. He — ” 
“Wenzl!” shouted Griick. The 
biped felt himself seized by Rudi 
from behind, while Wenzl, his 
face a white mask, came toward 
him around the desk. 

“They are holding me against 
my will!” shouted the biped, 
struggling. “My name is Martin 
Naumchik! They tried to drug 
me before they brought me up 
here!” 

Griick and Tassen were shout- 
ing. Wenzl had seized the biped’s 
arm in one hand and was gripping 
his muzzle in the other, holding 
it closed. Between them, he and 
Rudi raised the biped off his feet 
and began carrying him out the 
door. 

“Outrageous!” Griick was trum- 
peting. “A trick!” 

The newsman, almost as red- 
faced as he, was shouting, “Bring 
him back at once!” 



The door swung closed, cutting 
off the din. Without bothering to 
set him on his feet, Wenzl and 
Rudi carried the now unresisting 
biped down the corridor toward 
the elevator. 

TT'MMA, it appeared, had not 
only been sniffing the soap 
all the time the biped had been 
gone but had eaten some as well. 
She was taken to the infirmary, 
unconscious, and remained there 
two days. 

Deliveries of work stopped. 
Rudi, the keeper, disappeared 
and his place was taken by a 
heavy slow man named Otto. No 
one else visited the cage. 

Exhausted and triumphant, the 
biped spent most of his time in 
the front room of the cage, some- 
times reading or watching tele- 
vision, sometimes merely watch- 
ing the crowds, to which he had 
slowly become accustomed. He 
hoped to see Tassen again, but 
the man did not reappear. On the 
day after the interview, however, 
a man outside took a folded news- 
paper from his surcoat and 
spread it out for the biped to see. 

He was just able to read the 
headline, REALLY HUMAN, 
ZOO BIPED CLAIMS. Then a 
guard snatched the newspaper 
away and led the man off, lectur- 
ing him severely. 

The biped would have given a 
day’s meals for that newspaper: 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



55 



but now at least he knew that 
Tassen had written the story and 
the city editor had printed it. 

Now he could wait. Once the 
truth was out, they would never 
be able to hush it up again, what- 
ever they did. The biped schooled 
himself to patience. For a while 
he had toyed with the idea of let- 
tering some messages on large 
pieces of cardboard and holding 
them up to the crowd. But he was 
afraid that if he did so he would 
be taken out of the front room, 
and then he could not watch 
for Tassen. 

On the third day, Emma was 
brought in after breakfast, look- 
ing feeble and wild-eyed, her 
spines draggled. She gave the bi- 
ped a look as she passed which 
he could not interpret — wistful- 
ness, a reproach, an appeal of 
some kind? 

He found himself worrying 
about it and wanting to talk to 
her, but she did not emerge from 
her rooms. 

A little later, the outer door 
opened again and Otto came in. 
He stood in the doorway and 
growled, “Wanted upstairs. An 
interview. Come.” 

The biped got to his feet, feel- 
ing his heart begin to pound. He 
asked wryly, “No soap this time?” 
But the keeper stared at him in 
brute incomprehension. 

This time, instead of going to 
Griick’s office they passed it and 



entered a smaller room on the 
opposite side ofthe corridor. The 
room was empty except for a 
table and two chairs. 

Otto held the door without 
comment, waited until the biped 
was inside, then went out again,, 
closing the door. 

The biped looked around ner- 
vously, but there was nothing to 
see : only the three pieces of fur- 
niture, the scuffed black tiles of 
the floor and the mud-brown 
walls, which were dirty and in 
need of paint. 

After a long time, the door 
opened again and a large, olive- 
skinned man in a red surcoat ap- 
peared. Behind him the biped 
glimpsed the leviathan bulk of 
Griick, and heard his rich, fluting 
voice. 

“Of course, my dear Herr Opa- 
tescu, of course! We have always 
desired — ” 

“Don’t think I am taken in 
by these games,” said the visitor 
furiously, pausing in the doorway. 
“If I had not threatened to go to 
the Council — ” 

“You are mistaken, Herr Opa- 
tescu, I assure you! We only 
wished — ” 

“I know what you wished,” said 
Opatescu with heavy sarcasm. 
“Go on, I’ve had enough of it.” 

RUCK retired, looking chast- 
ened, and the visitor closed 
the door. He was carrying a pig- 



56 



GALAXY 



skin briefcase, which he put down 
carefully on the table. Then, with 
a toothy smile, he advanced on 
the biped and shook his hand 
cordially. 

“We newsmen have to stick to- 
gether when it comes to dealing 
with swine like that,” he said. 
“Allow me to introduce myself. 
My name is Opatescu. You have 
no idea the tricks they played to 
keep me out — but here I am! 
Now then, Herr Naumchik . 
one moment.” He busied himself 
with the briefcase, from which he 
produced a flat, clear crystic 
solid-state recorder and a micro- 
phone. “Here we are. Sit down, 
please — so.” He pushed the mi- 
crophone toward the biped, ad- 
justed the controls of the instru- 
ment and switched it on. The in- 
dicator began to crawl over the 
surface of the record block. 

Opatescu sat down opposite 
the biped, leaning forward on His 
arms, without bothering to re- 
move his bulky surcoat. “This re- 
cording is being made in the Ber- 
lin Zoo, June seventeenth, 2002. 
Present are Martin Naumchik, 
otherwise known as the biped 
Fritz, and the reporter Opatescu.” 

He settled himself more com- 
fortably and began again. “Now, 
Herr Naumchik — for I believe 
that you are in reality Martin 
Naumchik — I want you to tell 
me, if you will, in your own 
words just how your amazing ex- 



perience took place. Begin then, 
if you please.” 

The biped did as he was asked 
willingly enough, although Opa- 
tescu was a type he did not like 
— glib, assertive, the sort of re- 
porter you expected to find work- 
ing on Central European scandal 
sheets. But since the man was on 
his side, and anyhow a recording 
was being made — 

Opatescu listened rather rest- 
lessly but without interruption 
until the biped had brought his 
story up to date. Then, with a 
thoroughness which made the bi- 
ped wonder if his first estimate 
had not been mistaken, Opatescu 
took him over the story all over 
again, asking questions, eliciting 
more details, getting him to re- 
peat certain points several times 
in different words. When he was 
satisfied with this, he began ques- 
tioning the biped about his past 
life, and particularly about 
sources of evidence that he was 
actually Naumchik. They went 
over this ground with equal thor- 
oughness. When Opatescu finally 
turned off the recorder and began 
to pack it away, the biped 
watched him with grudging re- 
spect. 

“I must tell you I’m grateful 
to you for all this,” he said. “I 
suppose you’re a friend of Tas- 
sen’s, the man who broke the 
story?” 

“Tassen, yes, I know Tassen,” 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



57 



said Opatescu, busily fastening 
his briefcase. “He’s written some 
follow-up yarns, good stuff, you’ll 
see when you get out.” 

The biped moistened his stiff 
lips. “I don’t suppose you have 
any idea — ” 

“When that will be? Not long. 
You’re going to have a press con- 
ference, a big one this time — 
newspapers, sollies, TV. They 
can’t hold you after that. The 
public wouldn’t stand for it. Well, 
Naumchik, it’s been a pleasure.” 
He held out his meaty hand. 

“For me, too, Herr Opatescu. 
By the way, what paper did you 
say you were from?” 

“Pravda.” Opatescu glanced at 
his watch, then swung his brief- 
case off the table and turned to 
go. 

“Do you happen to know 
Kyrill Reshevsky, the — ” 

“Yes, yes, but let’s reminisce 
some other time, shall we?” He 
smiled, showing large gleaming 
teeth. “I’ve got a deadline. You 
understand. Goodbye, Herr 
Naumchik— patience.” Still smil- 
ing, he backed out and closed the 
door. 

The keeper Otto appeared al- 
most at once to take the biped 
back. Though usually laconic, he 
spoke lip on the way down to the 
cages. “So now they are going to 
let you out, are they?” 

“So it seems,” said the biped 
happily. 



“Well, well,” said Otto, shaking I 
his head. “What next?” 

TT'OR the next two days the bi- 
ped could not read or sit still 
for more than a few minutes at 
a time. He kept the television i 
turned on, and watched every I 
hourly news broadcast. Once, 
early on the first day, a commen- ! 
tator mentioned his story, and a ; 
brief glimpse of him on film — 
evidently taken on the day of j 
his arrival at the Zoo — was | 
flashed on the screen. After that, 
there was nothing. 

In between news broadcasts, 
he spent most of his time pacing 
up and down the office space, im- I 
prisoning poor Emma, who no 
sooner put her head out of her • 
room than the biped, by some ges- 
ture or exclamation, frightened 1 
her back in again. He gave the 
switchboard girl no rest, ringing , 
her up all day long and demand- j 
ing to speak to Griick, to Prinz- I 
metal, to anyone. On the after- I 
noon of the second day the phone 
went dead. The line had been 
disconnected. 

Shortly afterward, Otto en- ; 
tered. He had a bundle of news- r 
papers and magazines on his cart. | 
“They send you these,” he said, i 
dumping the bundle onto a va- j 
cant desk. “Read, and don’t both- 
er Fraiilein Muller.” He turned 
and left. 

The biped forgot him at once. | 



He snatched up the topmost pa- 
per — it was the Frankfurter 
Morgenblatt — and leafed through 
it with trembling fingers until 
he found a column headed, 
“STRANGE STATEMENTS OF 
ZOO BIPED.” 

He read the story avidly, al- 
though it was evidently nothing 
more than a rehash of his inter- 
view with Tassen. Then, curbing 
his impatience, he began sorting 
out the papers in the stack by 
date and piling them on the floor. 
When he got to the bottom of the 
stack, to his delight, he found a 
scrapbook and a pair of shears. 

Squatting on the floor — his 
old legs had never been so limber 
— he began carefully cutting out 
the stories about himself and 
pressing them onto the adhesive 
pages of the scrapbook. The cull- 
ed papers he put aside for later 
reading. 

As he worked, he discovered 
that the biped stories fell into 
three classes. First, straight and 
rather unimaginative reporting, 
like that of the Frankfurter Mor- 
genblatt; second, sympathetic 
pieces, appearing usually in the 
Sunday feature sections and with 
feminine by-lines (an item head- 
lined TRAPPED IN AN ANI- 
MAL’S BODY!, by Carla Ernst- 
ing, was typical of these); and 
finally, a trickle of heavily slanted 
stories and editorials, turning up 
in the later issues and in the 



newsmagazines. These he read 
with surprise and a growing fear. 
“Neurotic pseudohumanitarians,” 
said Heute in a boxed editorial, 
“seek to degrade humanity to the 
level of animals, and in so doing, 
strike at the very root of our civi- 
lization. Make no mistake: these 
sick minds would have us recog- 
nize as human every slimy polyp, 
every acid-breathing toad that 
can parrot a few phrases in Ger- 
man or walk through a simple 
maze. The self-styled Martin 
Naumchik, an upstart member of 
a vicious, degraded species . .” 

The biped crumpled the paper 
in a burst of anger. Rising, he 
circled the piles of newspaper, 
glaring at them. Then he squat- 
ted again, smoothed out the of- 
fending page and read the edi- 
torial to the end. 

But he was too agitated to go 
on working. He closed the scrap- 
book and went into his front 
room to stare out at the gray 
autumn day. The sky had turned 
cold and rainy, and few people 
were on the paths. 

He could no longer ignore the 
fact that people did not want to 
believe a biped’s body could be 
inhabited by a human mind and 
soul. In a general way he could 
even sympathize with it. But 
surely they must see that this 
was a special, different case! 

He pressed his muzzle against 
the cold glass, down which scat-

tered raindrops were slowly 
creeping. 

But what if they would not? 

He tried to imagine himself set 
free, recognized as Martin Naum- 
chik, his rights as a citizen re- 
stored . What then? A gro- 
tesque vision of himself, a naked 
biped, in the city room of Paris- 
Soir, talking to Ehrichs . then 
himself at a party, among fully 
dressed men and women with 
glasses in their hands. 

It was absurd, impossible. 
Where could he go? Who would 
accept him? Where could he get 
work, or even lodgings? 

The biped set his jaw stub- 
bornly, gripping his three-fingered 
hands together. “I am Martin 
Naumchik!”' he muttered. But 
even in his own ears, the words 
sounded false. 



VII 

The biped woke himself up, 
tossing and muttering, from a pe- 
culiarly unpleasant dream. Some- 
thing had happened to his body, 
his face had gone all soft and 
squashy, his limbs stiff . The 
horror of it was that everyone 
around him seemed to take this 
as entirely normal, and he could 
not tell then what was wrong. 

He came fully awake and sat 
up in bed, clanking his jaws and 
rumpling the feathery spines 
along his side with his fingers. He 



had been dreaming, he realized 
suddenly — dreaming of himself 
as he had been before the change. 

He sat for a moment, dully 
thinking about it. He felt a dim 
sense of betrayal, as if he had 
somehow foresworn his loyalty to 
that human body, once so famil- 
iar, which now seemed like an 
improbable nightmare. It dis- 
turbed him a little that his feel- 
ings could change so radically, in 
a matter of weeks. If that could 
happen, where was there a bot- 
tom to anything? 

He got out of bed, feeling his 
good spirits return with the 
healthy responses of his body. 
After all, there was no use look- 
ing backward. He was himself, as 
determined as ever, and — he 
stiffened with realization . how 
could he have forgotten? — this 
was the morning of his final ac- 
counting with Griick. 

Yawning nervously, he went 
into the living room and switched 
on the wall television. It was not 
time for the news yet. He glanced 
out the window, past the tem- 
porary fence, a dozen yards away, 
that the workmen had put up 
yesterday. The lawns and paths 
were empty in the early sunlight; 
there was a flutter of wings in 
one of the distant aviaries, then 
stillness again. 

Now that the time was so near, 
he was beginning to feel anxious. 
He had half expected Griick to 



•* 

try to drug him once more, and 
had slept every night with a bar- 
ricade across the doorway; but 
except for the fence, which kept 
anyone from coming near the 
cage, nothing had been done to 
interfere with him. He dragged 
the table and bookcase out of the 
w ay and wandered into the office 
space. 

As he crossed the room, Em- 
ma’s face appeared in her door- 
way. “Good morning,” she said 
timidly. 

He turned on the television. It 
was not time for the news yet. 

As he entered the office area, 
Emma’s face appeared in her 
doorway. “Good morning,” she 
said timidly. 

“Good morning, Emma,” the 
biped answered, mildly surprised. 
His attention was not on her. He 
was thinking about the press- 
conference to come. 

The female ventured a step or 
two out of the doorway. “Today 
is Wednesday,” she observed. 

“That’s right, Wednesday.” 

“This is the day you are going 
to prove you are Herr Naum- 
chik.” 

“Yes,” the biped said, surprised 
and pleased. 

“Then you will be going away.” 

“I suppose I will, yes.” What 
was the creature getting at? 

“I shall be all alone,” Emma 
said. 

“Well,” said the biped awk- 




60

THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



61 



wardly, “I expect you’ll get used 
to it.” 

“I shall miss you,” Emma said. 
“Good-by, Fritz.” 

“Good-by.” 

She turned and went back into 
her room. The biped stared after 
her, touched and vaguely dis- 
turbed. 

From the living room sounded 
a chime, then a hearty voice, 
“Eight hundred hours, time for 
the news! Good morning, this is 
Reporter Walter Szaborni, at 
your service. Seven hundred are 
known dead in a Calcutta earth- 
quake! Two members of the 
Council of Bavaria have been ac- 
cused of improper conduct! These 
and other stories — ” 

Hurrying into the living room, 
the biped picked up the control 
box that lay beside the chair and 
pressed the channel selector. In 
the wall screen, the ruddy-faced 
announcer vanished and was re- 
placed by a beaming elderly lady, 
eccentrically dressed, who sat at 
the keyboard of a piano. “For my 
first selection this morning,” she 
announced in a heavy Slavic ac- 
cent, “I shall play Morgenstem’s 
‘Dawn’ . .” Click! She gave way 
to a muscular young man in a 
cream-colored leotard, who sat 
on the floor rotating himself on 
one buttock. “Just ea-sily back,” 
he said, “and then forward — ” 
Click! 

“. We bring you the latest 



development in a case that has 
all Berlin talking,” said an invisi- 
ble voice. 

r T'HE biped caught his breath:] 

the screen showed a view of 
the Zoo grounds, moving at a 
walking pace toward the main 
building. With a curious shock, 
turning and looking out the win- 
dow, past the incurious faces of 
a few people who stood at the 
railing, the biped realized what 
he was about to see. Out there 
in the early sunshine, walking 
slowly across the lawn, was a 
man with a tiny television cam- 
era. 

“. who claims to be Martin 
Naumchik, a reporter for Paris- 
Soir,” the voice was saying. At 
the same moment, the outer door 
rattled. The biped vacillated a 
moment, then left the screen and: 
hurried into the office space. It 
was the keeper with his cart. 

“Otto! Have you any message 
for me?” 

“No message. Eat,” said Otto, 
unloading trays from his cart. 

“But, is the press conference 
really going to be held? Is any- 
one here yet?” 

“Plenty of people,” Otto grunt- 
ed. “All in good time. Eat.” He 
walked away. 

But eating was out of the ques- 
tion; the biped pushed the food 
around with his fork, took a bite 
or two, then gave it up and 

GALAXY 





walked restlessly back and forth 
in his inner room until, after what 
seemed hours, the door opened 
and Otto returned. 

As he ran into the office space, 
the biped caught sight of Emma 
peering out of her doorway again. 
Ignoring her, he demanded, “Are 
they ready for me now?” 

“Yes. Come,” Otto said. The 
biped smoothed down his spines 
and followed. 

There were crowds outside the 
gallery, and in the corridors as 
well; the biped glimpsed Prinz- 
metal going by with a harried ex- 
pression. Outside the penthouse 
dining room, there were men 
wearing earphones, crouching 
over metal boxes covered with 
switches and dials. A white-uni- 
formed Berlin policeman stood 
guard by the entrance. Ignoring 
him, Otto opened the door and 
leaned in for a moment, blocking 
the way with his body. He spoke 
to someone inside, then closed 
the door again. “Wait,” he told 
the biped. 

After a few moments the door 
opened again and a pale, sweaty 
face appeared. It was a young 
man the biped had never seen 
before. “All right, bring it in. 
Quickly, quickly!” 

“Always in a hurry, aren’t 
you?” Otto grumbled. “Very well, 
go, then.” He gave the biped a 
push. 

Inside, the pale young man 

THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



seized the biped’s arm. “Go 
straight in, don’t keep them wait- 
ing!” Beyond him, past the backs 
of several men who were stand- 
ing close together, the biped 
glimpsed Griick’s rotund figure 
behind a table. “And now,” the 
Director’s voice said nervously, 
“I present to you the biped, 
Fritz!” 

The biped walked stiffly for- 
ward in the silence. The big room 
was packed with people, some 
standing with cameras, the rest 
seated at tables arranged in arcs 
all the way back to the far wall. 
Griick gave the biped an unread- 
able look as he approached. “Tell 
them your story, Fritz — or shall 
I say Herr Naumchik?” He 
bowed and stepped back, leaving 
the biped alone. 

The biped cleared his throat 
with an unintended squawk, 
which caused a ripple of laughter 
around the room. Frightened and 
angry, he leaned forward and 
gripped the edge of the table. 

“My name is Martin Naum- 
chik,” he began in a loud voice. 
The room quieted almost at once 
as he spoke, and he could feel 
the listeners’ respectful attention. 
Gaining confidence, he told his 
story clearly and directly, begin- 
ning from the moment he had 
seen the young man with the 
camera outside his cage. As he 
talked, he looked around the 
room, hoping to see familiar faces, 

63

but the lights were so arranged 
that he could barely make out 
the features of those who were 
looking at him. 

When he finished, there was a 
moment’s silence, then a stir, and 
a forest of hands went up. 

“You, there,” said the biped, 
pointing helplessly at random. A 
woman rose. “Who told you to 
say all this?” she demanded. She 
had a sharp, indignant face, glit- 
tering eyes. A groan of protest 
went up around her. 

“No one,” said the biped firmly. 
“Next! You, there . yes, you, 
sir.” 

“You say you took a degree at 
the Sorbonne in 1999. Who was 
the head of the German depart- 
ment there?” 

“Herr Winkler,” the biped an- 
swered without hesitation, and 
pointed to another questioner. 

“Who was your superior on 
Paris-Soir when you worked at 
the home office?” 

“Claude JLhrichs.” 

M OST of the questions were 
the same ones he had an- 
swered before, many of them sev- 
eral times, at previous interviews; 
repeating the same responses 
over again made him feel a trace 
of discouragement. When would 
there be an end? But the attitude 
of the listeners cheered him: 
they were respectfully attentive, 
even friendly. 



A tall, red-bearded man stood 
up. “Let me ask you this, Hen 
Naumchik. What is your explana- 
tion of this incredible thing? How 
do you account for it?” 

“I can’t account for it,” the 
biped said earnestly. “But I’m 
telling you the truth.” 

There was a murmur of sym- 
pathy as the tall man sat down. 
The biped opened his mouth to 
speak again, but before he could 
do so the mellifluous voice of Dr. 
Griick was heard. “That ends our 
little question period, thank you 
very much, gentlemen and la- 
dies.” Griick came forward, fol- 
lowed by two keepers who quick- 
ly took the biped’s arms and 
started to lead him away. 

The biped, at first taken by 
surprise, began to resist. “I’m not 
finished!” he shouted. “I appeal 
to you, make them release me!" 
In spite of his struggles, the keep- 
ers were dragging him farther 
away from the table. “Make them 
release me! I am Martin Naum- 
chik!” 

They were at the door. Behind; 
them, an angry hum was arising 
from the audience. There were 
shouts of “Shame! Bring him 
back!” Over the growing uproar, 
Griick’s voice was vainly repeat- 
ing, “One moment, ladies and 
gentlemen! I beg your indul- 
gence! One moment! One mo- 
ment!” 

The keepers thrust the bipec 



outside; the door closed. The 
biped ceased to struggle. “Will 
you behave yourself?” demanded 
one of the keepers, straightening 
his collar. 

Otto appeared through the 
crowd, his face as stolid as ever. 
“Go on, if I want you I call you,” 
he grunted. “Fritz, come.” 

The biped followed him do- 
cilely, but his heart was thudding 
with excitement and indignation. 
“Did you hear it?” he demanded. 
“Did you hear how that man cut 
me off, just when — ?” 

“Not me,” said Otto. “I don’t 
concern myself with such things. 
I was sitting down and having a 
smoke.” Avoiding the crowd, he 
pushed the biped toward a rear 
stairway. They walked down two 
flights, then crossed a library ex- 
hibit, threading their way be- 
tween the tables and brushing 
through red banners that urged, 
“Read a book about animals!” 
This part of the building was al- 
most deserted; so was the gallery. 

As soon as Otto unlocked the 
outer door, the biped heard 
Griick’s voice booming from with- 
in. His excitement increased 
again: he ran into the living 
room. In the television screen, 
Herr Doktor Griick’s red, per- 
spiring face stared wildly. “Gen- 
tlemen and ladies, if I may have 
your kind attention! Gentlemen 
and ladies!” 

The voice of an invisible com- 



mentay>r cut in smoothly, “The 
hall is still in an uproar. The 
Herr Doktor is unable to make 
himself heard.” 

The biped danced with excite- 
ment in front of the screen, clasp- 
ing his hands together. Outside, 
beyond the fence, a crowd was 
gathering, but he ignored it. The 
sound from the television had a 
curious echoing quality, and he 
realized after a moment that 
Emma must have her set turned 
on next door, too. 

The noise was subsiding. Griick 
shouted, “Gentlemen and ladies 
— you have heard the biped’s 
statement! Now permit the Di- 
rector of the Zoo to make a state- 
ment also!” 

There were scattered cheers. 
Silence fell, broken at first by 
coughs and the shuffling of feet'. 
When it was complete, Griick 
spoke again. 

“Let me ask you to think about 
one question,” he said. “Where is 
Martin Naumchik?” 

He glanced from side to side. 
The silence deepened. “Where is 
Naumchik, this enterprising news- 
paperman, who has scored such 
a triumph?” A mutter arose; the 
camera swung to show restless 
movement in the room, one or 
two people rising; indistinct 
voices were heard. 

“Is he wandering the streets of 
Berlin, with an animal’s soul in- 
side his body?” Griick persisted. 



64

THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



65 



“Then why is he not seen? Isn’t 
this a curious question, gentle- 
men and ladies? Doesn’t this 
make you wonder, doesn’t it 
arouse your interest? I ask again, 
where is this famous Martin 
Naumchik? Is he hiding?” He 
stared out at the camera, eyes 
gleaming behind his rimless 
glasses. 

The biped clenched his fists in- 
voluntarily. 

“Suppose that I now tell you 
we are all the victims of a clever 
hoax?” Griick demanded. There 
were hisses, groans of protest 
from the audience. “You don’t 
believe it? You are too thorough- 
ly convinced?” 

A deep voice echoed up from 
somewhere in the audience. 
After a moment the camera 
swung around: it was the tall, 
red-bearded man who had spo- 
ken before. His voice grew clear- 
er. “ . this farce. Why did you 
hurry the biped out of sight — 
why isn’t he here to speak for 
himself?” Cries of approval; the 
red-bearded man looked self- 
satisfied, and folded his arms on 
his chest. 

Dr. Griick appeared again. 
“My dear Herr Wilenski — that 
is your name, is it not? — do you 
realize that if I am telling you 
the truth — ” he carefully smote 
his plump breast — “this biped 
is a very valuable animal, very 



high-strung and nervous, which 
must be protected? Am I to en- 
danger his health? Do you think 
I am such a fool?” A little laugh- 
ter; scattered shouts of approval. 

The red-bearded man popped 
into view again, aiming his finger 
sternly. “What about the biped’s 
charge that you drugged him? 
What have you to say to that?” 

Then Griick’s earnest face, in 
close-up: “Somehow the animal 
got hold of a piece of soap, Herr 
Wilenski. The keeper who was 
responsible has been — ” 

(“Soap?” echoed Wilenski’s 
voice.) 

“Yes, soap. The sodium and 
potassium salts in soap have a 
toxic effect on these bipeds. You 
must remember that they are 
not human beings, Herr Wilen- 
ski.” He raised one plump hand. 
“Let me continue.” Mutterings 
from the audience. “But first let 
me say this to you, Herr Wilen- 
ski, and to all of you — if I shall 
not convince you that we have 
to do here with a hoax, a dirty 
publicity scheme — if you shall 
have listened to me and still be- 
lieve that in that poor biped’s 
body there is the soul of a human 
being — then I solemnly promise 
you that I will release Martin 
Naumchik!” 

Sensation in the hall. The bi- 
ped closed his eyes and groped 
weakly behind him for the chair. 
His relief was so great that he 



did not hear the next few words 
j from the screen. 

“ — we here at the Zoo were 
' just as much in the dark as you, 
you may believe me! How could 
such a thing occur? We did not 
believe the biped’s story for a 
moment — yet, what other ex- 
planation could be found? We 
were at our wits’ end, gentlemen 
and ladies — until we had the 
lucky inspiration to search the 
biped’s cage! Then! Imagine our 
( shock, our horror, when we found 
... this!” 

The camera drew back. Griick. 
| half turning, was extending his 
hand in a dramatic gesture to- 
I ward a machine that lay on a 
‘ little table behind him. An assist- 
ant wheeled it closer. It was, as 
far as the biped could make out, 

I nothing but a solid-state recorder, 
the same kind of machine Opa- 
tescu had used . 

A cold feeling took him in the 
chest. He leaned forward un- 
easily. 

“Under the blankets of the bi- 
ped’s bed,” Griick’s voice went 
on, “we found this recording ma- 
chine concealed!” 

“How did it get there?” 
boomed Wilenski’s voice. 

Griick’s face turned; his ex- 
presion was solemn. “We are still 
investigpting this,” he said. “And 
you may believe me, that when 
the guilty individuals are caught, 
they shall be punished with the 



full severity of the law! But at 
this moment, I can say only that 
we are highly interested in ques- 
tioning the keeper who was dis- 
charged.” He stepped closer to 
the small table, laid his hand on 
the recorder. “Now, I want you 
all to listen to what we found in 
this concealed machine! Listen 
carefully!” 

He switched on the recorder. 

After a moment, a man’s deep 
voice spoke. “Listen and repeat 
after me. My name is Martin 
Naumchik ... I was born at 
Asnieres in 1976 ...I am a news- 
paperman. I work for Paris-Soir. 
My superior there is Monsieur 
Claude Ehrichs . .” 

A distant murmur came 
through the glass. The biped 
turned his head involuntarily, and 
saw a little knot of people clos- 
tered around the aerial of a port- 
able TV. Fists were being shaken. 
Voices drifted over, faintly: 
“Charlatan! Hoaxer!” 

With a sense of doom, the bi- 
ped turned back to the screen. 
The camera was panning now 
over the faces of the listeners. 
He saw shock and surprise give 
way to cynical understanding, 
disgust or anger. People were be- 
ginning to stand up here and 
there throughout the room; some 
were leaving. The biped saw the 
red-bearded man, shaking his 
head, move off toward the aisle. 

“Wait! Wait!” he called. But 



66 



GALAXY 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



67 



the man in the screen did not 
hear. 

The room was emptying. The 
monotonous voice of the recorder 
had stopped. Griick was standing 
idly looking out over the room, 
with a faint smile of satisfaction 
on his lips. Wenzl leaned over to 
speak to him; Griick nodded ab- 
sently. His lips pursed: he was 
whistling. 

“And so,” said the voice of the 
announcer breathlessly, “in this 
dramatic revelation, the mystery 
of the human biped is explained! 
All honor to Herr Doktor Griick 
for his dignified handling of this 
difficult situation! We now return 
you to our studios.” 

The screen flickered, cleared. 
The biped hit the control button 
blindly with his fist; the image 
faded, dwindled and was gone. 

“Ssss! Fritz the faker! Ssss!” 
came the voices from outside. 

T HE uproar in the Aviary re- 
doubled the moment Wenzl 
strode in. Toucans opened their 
gigantic beaks, Rapped their 
wings and screamed. The air was 
full of fluttering smaller birds, 
flash of tail feathers, red, yellow, 
blue. Macaws left off hitching 
themselves along their wooden 
perches, beak, claw, beak, claw, 
to flutter against the invisible air 
fence shrieking, “Rape! Rape!” 
Wenzl strode past them, his 
death’s-head face like a pale 




shark swimming down the green 
corridor of the Aviary. 

At the far end of the building, 
two under-keepers stood to atten-1 
tion. All was in order here. Wenzl 
crossed the short open entrance- 
way, making a path through the 
sluggish crowds, and went into 
the Primate House. 

Shrieks, roars and the thunder! 
of shaken bars greeted him as he 
stepped through the doorway. 
Capuchins hurtled forward over 
one another’s backs, clustering at 
the bars, showing their sharp yel- 
low teeth, shrieking their little 
lungs out. Proboscis monkeys 
dropped out of their tree-limb 
perches, blinking and chattering. 
The baboon, Hugo, leaped against 
his bars with a crash, shoved off 
and somersaulted in midair, flash- 
ing his blue behind; the two 
chimps rattled the bars and 
squealed together. 

Wenzl moved along the row ol 
cages, attentive and calm. He 
passed through another open en 
trance to the Reptile House. 

Here all was quiet. Wenzl’: 
glance softened for the first time 
The Galapagos tortoise, big as i 
wheelbarrow, was slowly munch 
ing a head of lettuce in his crue 
jaws. The boa constrictor wa 
coiled sluggishly around a con 
spicuous lump in its gullet. Foul 
diamondbacks hissed, clatterei 
faintly, slithered off into thei 
rocky den. 



In its floodlighted cage, the 
grass snake hung in graceful fes- 
toons. Its tiny head swayed to- 
ward Wenzl; the pink tongue 
flickered out. Wenzl paused an 
instant to regard it with pleasure. 
Then he moved on. 

In the Terrestrial Mammal 
House, there was a crowd around 
the rhinoceros wallow, where 
Prinzmetal was giving the rhino 
an injection. Finished, he climbed 
over the rail and joined Wenzl, 
mopping his brow with a tissue. 



“Successful?” Wenzl demand- 
ed. 

“Oh, yes, I think so,” said Prinz- 
metal in his soft, unassuming 
voice. “He will be all right.” 

“It is necessary for him to be 
all right.” 

“Oh, well, he will be.” They 
walked through the exit together, 
turned right, opened a door 
marked “No Admittance.” 

A slender, flaxen-haired young 
keeper was hurrying toward 
them, carrying a pail of fish.

“Schildt, why are you not feed- 
ing the sea lions?” Wenzl de- 
manded severely. 

“Just going now, sir!” said the 
unfortunate keeper, stiffening to 
attention. 

“Then what are you waiting 
for? Go!” 

“Yes, sir!” 

Wenzl, as he strode along be- 
side Prinzmetal, took a tiny note- 
book from his breast pocket and 
with a tiny silver pencil, sharp 
as a bodkin, made a minuscule 
entry in it. Prinzmetal watched 
him with one soft brown eye, but 
made no comment. 

“Have you seen the papers?” 
Prinzmetal asked, as they rode 
up in the elevator. 

“Yes,” said Wenzl. They got 
out. Wenzl hesitated, then fol- 
lowed Prinzmetal into the latter’s 
washroom. 

“What papers did you mean, 
exactly?” he asked. 

Prinzmetal, looking surprised, 
straightened up from the basin 
where he had begun washing his 
hands. “Oh — there it is, on the 
table. The Zeitung. On the third 
page. There’s a story about a 
baby in Buenos Aires that under- 
stands what you say to it in 
French, Spanish and German. 
Three months old.” 

“Yes.” 

“And the curious thing — what 
struck my attention — ” 

“Is that child’s French nurse- 



maid underwent an attack of 
amentia at the same time,” said 
Wenzl, biting his words. 

“Yes,” Prinzmetal said, forget- 
ting to wash. 

“She is incontinent,” said 
Wenzl. 

“Yes.” 

“She understands nothing, 
must be fed, can only make 
childish sounds. But the child 
understands French, German and 
Spanish.” 

“So, you saw the paper,” said 
Prinzmetal. 

“And you, did you see this in 
the Tageblatt?” Wenzl asked, al- 
most unwillingly. He took a fold- 
ed newspaper from his breast 
pocket. “A man and his wife in 
Tasmania each claims to be the 
other.” 

“I heard also, on the television, 
that while laying a cornerstone 
in Aberdeen, the mayor changed 
into a naked young girl, who ran 
away crying,” said Prinzmetal 
“But who knows what those fel- 
lows make up and what is true?’ 

“Supposing it should all be 
true?” Wenzl asked, folding his 
paper neatly and putting it away. 

“It would be interesting,” said 
Prinzmetal, turning his attention 
to his soft, hairy hands, which he 
began to scrub with care. 

“And?” 

“It is our duty to report to the 
Director anything that might he 
of importance to the work of the 



Zoo,” said Prinzmetal, as if recit- 
ing a lesson. 

“On the other hand,” said 
Wenzl deliberately, “It is useless, 
and even has a harmful effect, to 
take up the Herr Doktor’s time 
with baseless newspaper scan- 
dal.” 

The two men looked at each 
other for a moment with com- 
plete understanding in their eyes. 
“After all,” said Prinzmetal, dry- 
ing his hands, “what would be 
the good of it?” 

“Exactly,” said Wenzl, and 
folding his newspaper precisely 
lengthwise, he dropped it into the 
waste can. 

VIII 

VV7HEN the young man woke 
” up, he was in a narrow bed 
in a white-tiled room. Wires that 
came out of the bed were stuck 
to his head, arms and legs with 
sticky elastic bands. He plucked 
at them irritably, but they would 
not come off. 

He looked around. There was 
a doorway, open, but no window. 
In the corner, behind a single 
wall that half concealed it, was a 
w.c. In the other corner was a 
flimsy plastic chair and a reading 
light, but nothing to read. 

The young man tried to get 
up, pulling at the wires, and dis- 
covered they had silvery joints 
that would break apart. He got 



out of bed, trailing the wires. 

After a moment a stout wo- 
man in nurse’s uniform came in, 
and clucked her tongue at him. 
“Up, are you? Who told you you 
could?” 

“I want to use the w.c.,” he told 
her plaintively. 

“Well, go ahead, then back 
into bed with you. Herr Doktor 
Holderlein hasn’t seen you yet.” 
To his mild surprise, she stood 
with hands folded in front of her 
and watched while he used the 
toilet. Then she pushed him back 
and made him lie down, while 
she snicked the silvery jonts of 
the wires together again, all 
around the bed. “Lie still,” she 
told him. “No more nonsense. 
Here is the bell — ring if you 
want anything.” 

She showed him a plastic knob 
on the end of a flex cord, and 
went away, “Am I sick?” he 
called after her, but she did not 
come back. 

The young man tried once 
more to pull off the elastic bands, 
then gave it up. His last memo- 
ries were confused. He could re- 
member falling into the net, and 
being held down while he strug- 
gled. Then a feeling of being 
carried, a glimpse of many legs 
walking. Then nothing, until 
he found himself in a white- 
walled tiny room with bars in- 
stead of a door. His clothes were 
gone, and he was wearing gray 



70

the visitor at the zoo 



71 



pajamas. No one had come in an- 
swer to his calling, until he began 
to bang on the bars with a steel 
pot he found in the room, and 
then a man came and squirted 
water on him from a spray-gun. 
So he did not bang any more, 
but sat and shivered. 

He remembered falling asleep 
and waking up at least twice in 
that room. Once he had been 
fed. Then two men had come to 
fetch him, and they had given 
him his own clothes again, and 
coffee to drink, which he liked. 
Then they had taken him down 
a long corridor into a crowded 
room, and told him to wait. At 
the end of the room, behind a 
high counter, was a man in red 
robes, with a red floppy hat. The 
young man knew from his watch- 
ing of television that this man 
was a judge, and that he was go- 
ing to be sentenced . 

Now, here he was in still an- 
other place. Time passed. The 
young man was growing hungry, 
but did not dare ring the bell. 
At last an orderly came in with 
a cart, and he was allowed to sit 
up and eat. It was almost like the 
Zoo. Then the orderly came back 
for his plate, and hooked him up 
to the wires again; and for a long 
time nothing else happened. 

The young man was bewild- 
ered. Why was he here? What 
had the judge and that other 
man been whispering about, 



down at the end of the room, and 
why had the judge looked so an- 
noyed when he glanced his way? 

This place was better than the 
jail, it would not do to complain 
— but if he was not sick, then 
why was he here? 

Bells tinkled outside. Every 
now and then people passed his 
doorway, walking rapidly, with 
soft soles that swished and 
squeaked on the tile floor. 

Then the nurse came in again. 
“You are in luck,” she told him. 
“Herr Doktor Holderlein says 
you may see Herr Doktor Boeh- 
mer today.” She yanked his wires 
apart briskly, then helped him 
up. “Come, don’t keep the doctor 
waiting!” 

^JHE took his elbow and led 
^ him down the hall, where 
messages in colored letters rip- 
pled silently along the walls, to 
an office where a man with a 
bushy mustache sat behind a 
desk. On the desk was a card 
that said “Hr. Dr. Boehmer.” 

The doctor gave the young 
man a long measuring look, and 
unscrewed a thick old-fashioned 
tacrograph slowly. “Sit down, 
please.” He began writing on a 
pad. “Now then. Can you tell me 
your name?” 

The young man hesitated only 
a moment. If he said “Fritz,” he 
knew very well they would send 
him back to the Zoo. “Martin 



Naumchik, Herr Doktor,” he said. 
“Occupation?” 

“Journalist.” 

The doctor nodded slowly, 
writing. “And your address?” 
“Gastnerstrasse.” 

“And the number?” 

The young man tried to re- 
member, but could not. 

Doktor Boehmer pursed his 
heavy lips. “You seem a little 
confused. How long is it since 
you were in your apartment in 
Gastnerstrasse? ” 

The young man shifted un- 
comfortably. “I think, three — or, 
no, four days.” 

“You really don’t remember.” 
Doktor Boehmer wrote some- 
thing slowly, in his thick black 
handwriting, across the ruled pad. 
The young man watched him 
with apprehension. 

“Well then, perhaps you can 
tell me the date?” 

“June 10th, Herr Doktor . 
or perhaps the 11th.” 

Boehmer’s bushy eyebrows 
went up a trifle. “Very good. And 
who is the president of the High 
Council, can you tell me that?” 
“Herr Professor Onderdonck 
... is that right?” 

“No, not quite right. He was 
president last year.” Bohmer 
wrote something else slowly on 
the pad. “Well now.” He folded 
his heavy arms across the pad, 
holding the big black tacrograph 
as if it were a cigar. “Tell me, do 



you remember being in the de- 
partment store?” 

“Oh, yes, Herr Doktor.” 

“And hiding upstairs, and 
coming down during the day?“ 
“Yes, Herr Doktor.” 

“And why did you do that?” 
The young man hesitated, op- 
ening and closing his mouth sev- 
eral times. 

“You can tell me, Herr Naum- 
chik. Go ahead. Why did you do 
it?” 

The young man said helpless- 
ly, “Because I had nowhere else 
to go, Herr Doktor.” 

Boehmer slowly unfolded his 
arms and made another mark on 
the pad. He reached without 
looking and touched a bell-push 
at the corner of his desk. “I see. 
Well then, Herr Naumchik, to- 
morrow at the same time, is it 
agreed?” 

“Yes, Herr Doktor.” The nurse 
entered and stood holding the 
door open. The young man rose 
docilely and went out. 

“Doctor says you can sleep 
without the wires tonight,” said 
the nurse briskly as they entered 
his room again. Breathing 
heavily through her nose, she 
stood close to him and began 
peeling off the elastic bands. 
“Don’t squirm,” she said. 

“It hurts.” 

“Nonsense, this takes only a 
moment. There.” She wadded up 
the bands, wrapped the wires

around them and turned to leave. 
“Lie down now, rest.” 

“But nurse, why do I have to 
be here? Am I sick?” the young 
man asked. 

She turned and stared at him 
briefly. “Of course, you are sick. 
But you are getting much better. 
Now rest.” She waddled out. 

A FTER a long time there was 
supper, and then pills to swal- 
low. When he woke up, it was 
morning again. 

“Good news!” cried the nurse, 
entering to plump up his pillows. 
“You have a visitor today!” 

“I have?” the young man 
asked. His heart began to beat 
faster. He could not imagine who 
it could be. Someone from the 
Zoo? 

“A young lady,” said the nurse 
archly. 

“What’s her name? I don’t 
know any young lady.” 

“All in good time. Eat your 
breakfast now, then comes the 
barber to shave you, and next 
you will see your friend.” 

She left. The young man rub- 
bed at the furry growth on his 
cheeks and chin. Shaving he 
knew, but not how it was done. 
It would be good to be shaved. 

After breakfast the barber 
came in, a short, dark man in a 
white coat, who plugged a buzz- 
ing machine into the wall and ap- 
plied it, with a bored expressiorf, 



to the young man’s whiskers. At 
first it pulled and hurt him, then 
it was better, and at last the hair 
was all gone. His skin stopped 
itching and felt delightfully 
smooth to the touch. 

He waited impatiently. An or- 
derly came and gave him a comb, 
and he combed his hair in the 
mirror, several ways, until he 
thought it was correct. 

Then he still had to wait. At 
last the nurse came in again, 
looked at him critically, and said, 
“Very good! Follow me!” 

She took him to a little room 
with windows, rather bare and 
clean, with upholstered chairs 
and magazines in a rack. In the 
room stood a woman in a blue 
dress. There was a man in a white 
coat a little behind her. Glancing 
from one to the other, the young 
man recognized Herr Doktor 
Boehmer almost at once, but it 
was only when the woman 
stepped forward that he knew 
her. She was the woman in the 
store — the one who had slapped 
him. 

“Oh, my poor Martin, what has 
happened to you?” she wailed, 
putting out her arms. 

The young man stepped back 
nervously. “They say I am sick,” 
he muttered, watching her close- 
ly- 

“You identify our young 
friend, then, Frau Schorr?” asked 
the doctor amiably. 



“He doesn’t remember me,” 
ghe said in a tight voice. “But it’s 
Martin, of course it’s Martin.” 

“And you are his — ” 

The woman bit her lip. “His 
sister. Will they let me take him 
away, Herr Doktor, do you 
think?” 

“That depends on many things, 
Frau Schorr,” said the doctor se- 
verely. “Come into my office when 
you are finished, and let us dis- 
cuss it in detail.” 

“Yes, in a moment,” she said, 
turning back to the young man. 
“Martin, you would like to go 
with me?” 

He hesitated. It was true that 
she did not seem so excitable as 
before, but who knew when the 
mood might not take her again? 

“To get away from this place?” 
she asked. 

The young man made up his 
mind. “Yes, please, I would like 
it.” 

She smiled at him and turned 
to the doctor. “Very good, Herr 
Doktor, now I am at your serv- 
ice. Until very soon, Martin . .” 
They both went out. In a few 
moments the nurse came to lead 
him back to his cubicle. 

Then, although the young man 
waited expectantly, nothing hap- 
pened except lunch. After the 
meal was cleared away he waited 
again, growing indignant, but 
hours went by and still no one 
came. 



The orderly brought his din- 
ner. He began to feel frightened. 
Suppose something had gone 
wrong, and the woman was never 
coming back at all? 

The nurse would not answer 
his questions, but kept repeating 
stupid things like, “Wait and see. 
Don’t be so impatient. Why are 
you in such a hurry?” She gave 
him pills to take, and insisted 
on hooking him up to the wires 
again. Then he woke up, and 
again it was morning. 

“Good news!” cried the nurse 
cheerily, entering the room. “They 
are going to release you today!” 

r T , HEY are?” the young man 
asked eagerly. He tried to 
clamber out of bed, but was 
brought up short. “Devil take 
them!” he shouted, tearing at 
the wires. “Nurse, get me my 
clothes!” 

“Temper, temper!” she said, 
raising her hands in mock dis- 
may. “Can’t you wait even till 
after breakfast? Such impa- 
tience!” She disconnected the 
wires at the joints and tucked 
them neatly away. “Nothing was 
ever done in a hurry,” she went 
on. “There, go, wash yourself. All 
in good time.” She bustled out. 

The young man cleaned him- 
self and combed his hair again. 
It was hard to sit still. Breakfast 
came and he ate Some of it, think- 
ing, “Now she is almost here.”

But more hours passed in the 
same endless way as before. What 
could have gone wrong? He 
stood in the doorway and waited 
for the nurse; at last she came. 

He held out his hand. “Nurse, 
when are they going to let me 
out?” 

“Soon, soon,” she said, slipping 
past him. “Go and comb your 
hair — don’t worry. It won’t be 
long.” 

“But you said that this morn- 
ing!” the young man shouted after 
her. It was no use. She was gone. 

When he had been sitting for 
a long time, staring blankly at 
the floor, an orderly came in. 
“Your hair is a fright," he said. 
The orderly himself had care- 
fully waved hair, gleaming with 
oil. “Here, use my comb,” he said. 

“When are they going to let 
me go?” 

“I don’t know. Soon,” the or- 
derly said indifferently, and went 
away. 

Lunch time came. Now the 
young man realized that it was 
all a cruel joke. He lay down on 
the bed, leaving his dishes un- 
touched. 

There was a clatter at the door. 
The orderly entered, pushing a 
metal rack on which some clothes 
were hung. Watching incredulous- 
ly, the young man recognized the 
trousers and surcoat he had been 
wearing before; the coat was 
ripped up the side, and the 



r 

sleeve was grimy with sonp 
sticky, odorous mass. 

“Put them on,”, said the ordei 
ly. “Orders.” He went away agait 
The young man dressed hin 
self awkwardly. His heart wa 
beating very fast, and he ha< 
trouble deciding which way sorp 
of the things went on. At last h 
was done, and he combed his hai 
carefully all over again. 

Then he waited. Footstep 
came and went hurriedly in thi 
corridor; white- jacketed figure 
passed and repassed. A bell jan 
gled, and a boy in a purple rob 
went by carrying a candle in 
glass bowl, followed by a man i 
black robes, head down, mun 
bling something to himself. Th 
bell dwindled in the distance. 

A burst of laughter sounds 
from somewhere not far awaj 
“Well, you know what I wouli 
have told him!” a hearty mal 
voice exclaimed. Then two voice 
began speaking together, in lowe 
tones, and the young man coul 
not make out any more of th 
words. 

■ Footsteps approached the doo ^ 
again. In walked a woman. V/

and overdress under which tb I 
shape of her body could hard «§1

t 



and nervous and did not meet 
his eyes. 

“Martin, they promised they 
would release you at nine-thirty 
this morning,” she said at once, 
“and here it is almost — ” 

“Madame Schorr,” the orderly 
interrupted, putting his head in 
at the door, “they are blinking 
for you to come down to the 
office at once.” 

“Oh, my God!” said the woman 
and, turning around, she walked 
out again. 

The young man waited. At last 
Frau Schorr entered, walking 
rapidly. This time she looked 
flushed and energetic. “Come, 
quickly,” she said, taking his arm, 
“before they change their minds.” 

“I can go?” he asked. 

“Yes, it is all arranged. Hurry!” 

She led him down the white 
hall, past the blinking colored let- 
ters on the wall. There were pot- 
ted plants at every intersection 
of corridors — always the same 
plant, with shiny saw-toothed 
leaves. 

They got into a rapid elevator 
of the kind the young man had 
seen in the store. It opened for 
them, clicked shut and with a 
dizzy swoop they were hurtling 
downward; then another swoop 
in the reverse direction, a click, 
and they were standing on the 
gray tile floor of a large lobby, 
with enormous windows of clear 
glass through which the young 






man could see the central tower 
of the Flugbahn, glittering in the 
sunlight against a sky of pure 
blue. 

“Hurry!” said the woman, lead- 
him to another elevator. This one 
was the spiral kind. They drop, 
ped through a glass tube, past 
dark walls at first, then, startling, 
ly, into the daylight. 

What had happened to the 
building? The young man craned 
his neck, saw the titanic slab of 
masonry receding above his head, 
They had emerged from the bot- 
tom of the hospital, which was 
supported high in the air on con- 
Crete legs. Around them bright 
green lawns and flowering shrubs 
were visible. Only one othei 
building could be seen in the 
middle distance, and that was a 
single, carelessly carved block of 
pink stone, without windows or 
visible entrances. Beyond, the 
rooftops of a few buildings 
showed over the treetops. 

The elevator went underground 
without pausing, and a moment 
later they were in the white, flat 
light of a subterranean tunnel. A' 
they left the elevator, an oval car| 
drifted up on two fat wheels. K 
stopped, and the transparent top 
swung open. There was no driver 
The young man hung bad 
but Frau Schorr urged him in 
They sat down on the deep cush 
ions; the top hesitated, then slow 
ly dropped and latched with i 



click. The woman leaned for- 
ward. “Take us to the Fiedler 
platz exit, please.” 

After a pause, a mechanical 
voice spoke from the grille facing 
them. “That will be two marks 
ten, please.” The woman fumbled 
in her purse, found a piece of 
paper money and put it into a 
slot beside the grille. “Thank 
you,” said the voice; coins clat- 
tered into a metal cup. The wo- 
man picked them out carefully 
and put them away as the car 
glided into motion. 

They did not seem to be mov- 
ing fast, but the young man felt 
himself pressed back into the 
cushions, and the white lights of 
the tunnel whisked by at a dizzy- 
ing rate. 

Other cars were visible far 
ahead and behind. Now the tun- 
nel forked, the left-hand branch 
turning downward, the right- 
hand one up. Their car whirled 
to the left without losing speed. 
At a second fork, they turned 
right, rising again. 

The car glided to a stop beside 
an elevator, identical to the one 
they had taken from the hospital. 
The top swung back. 

A little dizzy from so much 
rapid motion, the young man 
followed the woman into the ele- 
vator. As the car rose in the tube, 
another car with two men and a 
child in it whirled down past 
them in the counter-spiral. It 



made the young man feel ill to 
watch them, and he shut his eyes. 

jV”OW they were aboveground 
once more. The street was 
full of cool blue shadow, but over 
their heads the sun was still 
warm on the facades. Taking his 
arm again, the woman led him 
across the empty pavement to 
one of the entrances, over which 
the young man read the number 
“109” in silver letters. 

In the lobby, she paused, one 
gloved hand going to her mouth. 
“You have your key?” she asked. 

“Key?” The young man ex- 
plored his pockets, brought up 
the key on the gold ring. “Is this 
it?” 

She took it with relief. “Yes, 
I’m quite sure. Come.” 

They entered another eleva- 
tor, an ordinary straight-up one 
this time, and the woman spoke 
to the grille, “Three.” 

They emerged into a narrow 
hallway carpeted in beige and 
green. Frau Schorr led the way 
directly to a door numbered 3C, 
opened it with the key. 

Inside, they found themselves 
in greenish dimness. 

The room was small, with a 
narrow bed, a table with some 
coffee things, a typewriter on a 
desk. There was no dust, but the 
air had a stale, bottled-up smell. 

The woman crossed to the win- 
dows and threw back the green 



78

draperies, letting in the sunlight. 
She touched a button on the con- 
trol panel over the bed, and at 
once fresh air began to whisper 
into the room. 

“Well, here you are then!” said 
the woman happily. “Your own 
little room again . .” She paused. 
“But you don’t remember this, 
either?” 

The young man was looking 
around. He had never seen the 
room before, and did not much 
care for it. “Isn’t there any tele- 
vision?” he asked. 

The woman studied him for a 
moment, then went to the control 
panel again, touched another but- 
ton. A picture on the wall opened 
and folded back, revealing a TV 
screen, which instantly bloomed 
into life. A man’s smiling face 
loomed toward them, gigantic, 
all-swallowing, while laughter 
roared from the wall. Then the 
sound died, the open-mouthed 
face shrank and disappeared as 
the woman touched the controls 
again. 

The halves of the picture 
jerked, flapped, slid together. 

“What’s the matter?” asked the 
woman. 

“I didn’t know it was going to 
do that,” said the young man, 
quivering. 

She looked at him thoughtful- 
ly. “I see.” She put the tips of 
her gloved fingers to her lips. 
“Martin, you know this is your 



own room. It doesn’t remind you 
at all? I thought perhaps when 
you saw it- — no. I think it’s better 
that you don’t stay here, Martin, 
Come, help me.” 

She crossed briskly to the op- 
posite wall, slid back a panel, 
took out two pieces of luggage. 
She laid them open on the bed, 
then crossed the room again, 
pulled a drawer out of the wall, 
scooped up a pile of clothing. 
“Here, take these.” She dumped 
the clothing into his arms. “You 
put everything on the bed, I’ll 
pack.” 

“But where are we going?” he 
asked, carrying his burden obedi- 
ently across the room. 

“To my apartment,” she said. 
She picked up the clothes, 
straightened them neatly, began 
to pack them into the larger of 
the two suitcases. “Go, get more.” 

T'HE YOUNG man went back, 
found another drawer under 
the first. There were nothing but 
socks in this one. He brought 
dutifully over to the bed. 

“And if Frau Biefleder doesn’t 
like it, let her choke!” said the 
woman, punching shirts down 
into the open suitcase with brisk, 
angry motions. 

Understanding nothing, the 
young man did as he was told. 
All the clothing, including two 
sets of overgarments, went into 
the larger suitcase. The other

GALAXY 



case, which was very flat and nar- 
row, was filled with papers from 
the desk. Frau Schorr took both 
suitcases, and the young man car- 
ried the typewriter in its case. 
They went down again in the 
elevator, across the street, down 
the other elevator, and got into a 
cab exactly like the one that had 
brought them. 

This time they emerged into a 
more populous street. Carrying 
their suitcases, they crossed the 
open area past a group of strolling 
girls, a tall boy on a unicycle, a 
flower vender. 

There were shops on either 
side, with interesting things dis- 
played in their windows, but 
Frau Schorr would not let him 
linger. They turned the first cor- 
ner to the left, entered a building 
faced with blue stone. In the lob- 
by sat a little white-haired old 
lady with a face full of wrinkles. 
“Good afternoon, Frau Beifeld- 
er,” said Frau Schorr stiffly. The 
old woman did not reply, but 
stared after them with tiny, red- 
rimmed eyes. 

“It’s good for her to be shocked 
a little, after all,” muttered Frau 
Schorr as they crowded into the 
elevator. She looked distressed. 
The young man would have liked 
to comfort her, but did not un- 
derstand what was the matter, so 
he said nothing. 

Upstairs, the hall was tiny, 
with only two red-enameled 



doors. “Well, here we are at last!” 
said the woman brightly, opening 
the first of these. 

Inside was a sunny and com- 
fortable-looking room, with bright 
colors in the upholstery and rugs. 
As they entered, a tawny cat 
leaped down from the window 
seat and came toward them, pale 
blue eyes staring from a masked 
face. 

The young man looked at it in 
surprise. He had never seen a 
housecat before, except in pic- 
tures — only the big ones in the 
Zoo, and those from a distance. 

“Is it fierce?” he asked. 

“Maggie?” said the woman, 
looking puzzled. “Whatever do 
you mean?” She stooped to pick 
up the cat, which was staring at 
the young man with its back 
arched, making a low wailing 
noise. When she lifted it, it hung 
limply from her hand for a mo- 
ment like a furpiece, then writhed 
once and leaped to the floor. 

The wailing sound grew loud- 
er. The fur along the cat’s back 
was ruffled. 

“Oh, dear!” said the woman. 
“Maggie, don’t you remember 
Martin?” She turned to him in 
bewilderment. “She is upset. Sit 
down, dear, everything is going 
to be all right. Take off your sur- 
coat and rest a little. You shall 
have some coffee and sandwiches 
in a moment.” The cat was ad- 
vancing, stiff-legged; she pushed 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



81 



it away with her foot. With an 
angry screech, it retreated to the 
windowseat again and tucked it- 
self together into a ball. Its blue 
eyes grew narrow, but whenever 
the young man moved they 
widened and its mouth opened in 
a sharp-toothed smile. 

“I can’t imagine what is the 
matter with her,” said Frau 
Schorr from the next room. A 
cupboard door banged shut; a 
pot clattered. “She is such an af- 
fectionate creature, and she al- 
ways liked you, Martin.” 

Wanting to examine a picture 
on the opposite wall, the young 
man took one or two steps to- 
ward it, watching the cat out of 
the corner of his eye. 

The animal stared back at him 
and made a faint hissing noise, 
but did not move. Emboldened, 
the young man crossed the room 
and looked at the picture closely, 
but still could not decide what it 
represented. 

¥>AFFLED, he turned away, 
just as something squat and 
dirty-white waddled into view 
from the hall doorway. It looked 
up at him out of tiny red eyes 
and made a wheezing sound. Spit- 
tle hung from the loose lips of its 
enormously wide mouth, and two 
discolored fangs stuck up from 
the lower jaw. It stared at the 
young man in astonishment for a 
moment, then the gray-white hair 



on its shoulders rose stiffly and it 
made a menacing noise. The 
young man raised a hand. The 
animal began to bark, dancing 
about in the doorway, its eyes 
bulging insanely to show the yel- 
lowish, bloodshot whites. 

The young man backed away 
as far as he could go. 

“Churchill!” called the woman 
from the kitchen. The dog turned 
its head toward her voice, but 
went on barking. “Churchill!” she 
called again, and in a moment 
came hurriedly into the room, 
wiping her hands on her apron. 
“Shame!” she said, glancing at 
the young man. “Churchill, what 
is the matter with you?” The 
barking continued. 

“Now then!” said the woman, 
slapping the infuriated animal on 
the snout with her palm. The dog 
hiccoughed, shook its head and 
stared up at her with a surprised 
expression. It barked once more. 
The woman slapped it again, 
more gently. “No, Churchill — 
shame! This is Martin, don’t you 
remember? He has forgotten 
you,” she said apologetically over 
her shoulder. “Go on now, back 
to your rug, Churchill. Bad dog, 
go on!” She herded the dog 
through the doorway. It moved 
stiffly backward, then turned re- 
luctantly and disappeared, wheez- 
ing and snuffing. A final bark 
sounded from the next room. 

“Oh, dear,” said the woman. 



82 



GALAXY 



“I’m so sorry, Martin. Excuse me 
a moment — the coffee.” She went 
back into the kitchen, and the 
young man, slightly unnerved, be- 
gan trotting back and forth be- 
side the low bookshelves, looking 
at the titles of the books. 

At the far corner of the room 
he came upon a tiny cage sus- 
pended from a polished brass 
stand. There was a beige cloth 
cover on the cage. Curious, he 
plucked up the edge of the cloth 
and peered inside. In the dim- 
ness, a tiny bird with green and 
violet feathers was perched on a 
miniature trapeze. One pin-sized 
golden eye blinked at him; the 
creature said, “Weep?” 

The young man closed the 
cover again. “It is just like the 
Zoo,” he thought. 

The woman returned, looking 
flustered, with a tray in her 
hands. On the tray were sand- 
wiches and coffee. She set it 
down on the table in front of the 
sofa. “Now come, eat, Martin, you 
must be hungry.” She made him 
sit on the sofa, and while he duti- 
fully ate the sandwiches and 
drank the good coffee, she sat op- 
posite him in the upholstered 
chair, hands clasped in her lap, 
smiling faintly as she watched 
him eat. Her cheeks were flushed 
with' exertion. A few strands of 
dark hair had escaped from her 
coiffure and hung over her fore- 
head. 



“Yes, eat, that is good,” she 
said. “Would you like some mu- 
sic, Martin?” The young man 
nodded, with his mouth full. The 
woman rose, went to a machine 
in the corner and punched sev- 
eral buttons. After a moment the 
machine began to emit music, 
something slow and soothing, 
played by an orchestra with 
many violins. The young man lis- 
tened with pleasure, waving his 
sandwich. 

The woman sighed, then 
smiled. “No. You don’t remember, 
do you?” she asked. 

“Remember what?” 

“The music. We used often to 
dial it . never mind.” She 
crossed to the machine again and 
touched it; the music stopped. 
“But it’s really true, then, that you 
don’t remember anything?” 

“I think I do,” said the young 
man, lying cautiously. “You are 
my sister — ” 

“No!” said the woman vehe- 
mently. “That’s not true at all. 
You don’t remember.” Her mouth 
was compressed and her eyes 
were closed. 

“But then why did you tell the 
doctor that you were my sister?” 
the young man demanded, be- 
wildered. 

“Because I had to be a mem- 
ber of your family, or they would 
not have let me sign you out.” 

The young man swallowed, 
thinking this over. He laid his 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



83 



sandwich down. “But if you are 
not my sister — ” 

“Yes?” 

“Then what are you?” 

The woman’s face colored, and 
she glanced away. “Never mind, 
Martin . just a friend. We are 
just friends. Hand me those ciga- 
rettes, won’t you, Martin?” 

He followed her glance; there 
was nothing on the low table be- 
side him but an ashtray and an 
enameled box. He lifted the lid: 
Correct, there were cigarettes in- 
side. 

She took one, lit it with a tiny 
rose-quartz lighter, tilted her 
head back to puff out a long 
streamer of smoke. With her left 
hand she was absently setting the 
black pieces in their places. 

“Don’t you want one?” she 
asked. 

The young man looked dubi- 
ously at the white cylinders. He 
had never tried to smoke a ciga- 
rette, but doubtless it was one of 
the things he should learn. 

He put one gingerly between 
his lips, took it out again and 
looked at it, then replaced it and 
touched the other end with the 
lighter. He sucked cautiously; the 
cigarette glowed. Cool, bitter- 
tasting smoke ran into his mouth. 
Before he realized what he was 
doing, he breathed some of it 
into his lungs, where it felt aston- 
ishingly good. He took another 
pull at the cigarette. He realized 



with grateful delight that the 
smoke was somehow soothing 
one of the urgent discomforts he 
had been feeling all this time, 
ever since he had left the Zoo. 

“How good that is!” he said, 
staring at the burning cylinder. 

The woman’s eyes filled with 
tears. She leaned forward and 
put put her cheek against his. 
Her arms went around him con- 
vulsively. 

“Oh, darling, had you forgotten 
that too?” she said weeping. 

IX 

r I ''HE BIPED awoke. The room 
-*• was flooded with pale, color- 
less morning light. He got slowly 
out of bed, clacking his jaws. 
What day was this? He could 
not remember. But what did it 
matter, anyhow? 

He could hear Emma in the 
office space, already clattering 
away at the orthotyper. The 
biped got a drink of water, 
glanced into his outer room — no 
one was at the railing as yet, the 
Zoo was not open so early — then 
wandered into the office space 
and sat down at his desk. 

The basket was piled with 
work he had not finished yester- 
day, but it was only accounting 
forms. Nowadays they gave him 
nothing else to do. He picked up 
the top one, then set it down 
again without even trying to read 



84 



GALAXY 



it; it was too much trouble. 

The female said something in 
a low voice. In his surprise at 
hearing her speak, he missed the 
words. 

“What?” 

She said, without pausing or 
looking up from her work: “Do 
you think you are the only one 
who is unlucky? I don’t.” 

The biped gaped at her. “What 
do you mean by that?” 

“Some others, also, have a dif- 
ficult life.” She whipped the page 
neatly out of her machine, added 
it to the stack beside her. She 
inserted another page, spaced 
down, began typing again. 

The biped felt vaguely insult- 
ed. He snorted. “What do you 
know about it?” 

Before she could reply, the 
outer door clicked. Emma stop- 
ped typing. They both turned 
to watch Otto come in with his 
cart. “Breakfast,” said the man 
gruffly. “Here, take it, eat, don’t 
waste my time.” He dumped a 
basket of work on the biped’s 
desk, then another on Emma’s. 

Blinking angrily, the biped 
picked up his covered plate and 
carried it into his own room. 

What did the creature mean 
by it? Who was she, to speak to 
him in that way? 

His anger grew; he could hard- 
ly eat. He put the plate aside 
half-finished, went back into the 
office space. Emma was not there. 



He walked aimlessly around 
for a while, kicking at the gray 
tiles. Here was the scuffed mark, 
almost invisible, where Griick 
had drawn a chalk line across the 
room. There was irony for you! 
To protect Emma from him, as 
if he were some sort of crude 
beast, whereas in reality it was 
just the other way around. 

He heard a noise, and turned 
to see the female coming out of 
her room. She paused. Her hands 
went to the knob on her head. 

“Look here, Emma,” the biped 
began a little uncertainly. 

“You are on my side of the 
room,” she piped. 

“Oh, hang that! What does it 
matter, any more?” The biped 
took a step toward her, growing 
excited. “Look here, just be- 
cause you’ve lived in a Zoo all 
your life, I suppose you think — ” 
She snapped something, and 
moved past him to her desk. 

“What was that?” the biped 
demanded irritably. “Speak up.” 
“I said, I have not lived in a 
Zoo all my life.” The female put 
on her earphones, rolled paper 
into the machine, began to type. 

“Well, perhaps not in this Zoo, 
but you were born in a Zoo some- 
where, weren’t you?” 

Emma glanced up. “I was born 
on Brecht’s Planet. They came 
and took me away when I was a 
baby.” Her typing resumed. 

The biped felt he had some- 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



85 



how been put in the wrong. “Well, 
of course that’s too bad and so 
forth, but don’t you see the dif- 
ference?” He began to speak 
more vehemently, warming to his 
subject. “My God, I should think 
it’s obvious enough. Here are 
you, an animal that’s spent most 
of its life in one Zoo or another 
— you’re used to it, you can put 
up with it. And here am I, a man 
shut up in an animal’s body, kept 
in this stinking cage day after 
day!” 

While he was speaking, the fe- 
male had stopped her work, and 
now sat looking quietly down at 
her three-fingered hands on the 
keyboard. 

After a moment, she got up 
from her chair and began to walk 
past him. Her eyes were closed. 
The biped saw that her throat 
was working convulsively. 

“Oh, now, wait a minute,” he 
said, stricken. 

She kept on walking. When a 
desk got in her way, she ma- 
neuvered around it by using her 
hands. 

“Look here, Emma,” the biped 
said, “I didn’t want to hurt your 
feelings or anything. The fact is, 
I got carried away. I didn’t mean 
the cage is actually stinking, it 
was just an expression.” 

The female disappeared into 
her room. Irritated again, the 
biped followed as far as the door- 
way. “Come out, Emma!” he 



shouted. “Haven’t I said I was 
sorry?” 

Emma did not reply. Although 
the biped hung sulkily around 
the office space for hours, she did 
not come out for the rest of the 
morning. 

4CTJUT tell me,” Neumann was 
saying at lunch that after- 
noon, under the shifting colored 
lights of the rotunda, “in all se- 
riousness, my dear Griick, what 
was the truth of the matter? You 
managed it so cleverly that I am 
still confused. Is the biped really 
this Herr Naumchik, or not?” 

Herr Doktor Griick laid down 
his knife and fork, his eyes, turn- 
ing sober behind their rimless 
glasses. “My dear Neumann,” he 
said slowly, “what does it mat- 
ter? In either case, the result is 
just the same — we have, as be- 
fore, two bipeds. One is male, the 
other female.” 

“But if the male was a human 
being before?” 

“Still he is a biped now.” The 
good doctor stuffed a bite of liver 
sausage into his mouth and 
chewed vigorously. “If I take any 
credit to myself in this whole af- 
fair, gentlemen, and really, allow 
me to say this in passing, my suc- 
cess has been due to the excellent 
cooperation of my staff — ” 

“Too modest,” murmured Neu- 
mann. 

“Not at all!” cried Dr. Griick 



86 



GALAXY 



happily- “But if, and I emphasize 
if, I take any credit to myself, it 
is precisely because I alone per- 
ceived this one small fact from 
the beginning. Who or what our 
Fritz was, before, is not of the 
slightest consequence. If we are 
to believe the Hindus, our Wenzl 
here might have been a beetle in 
some previous incarnation.” 

Here Griick paused to let the 
laughter subside. “But this makes 
no difference. Beetle or no, at the 
present moment he is still Wenzl. 
Our Wenzl understands this, I 
am confident. As for our Fritz, 
he does not understand it as yet. 
But when he does, trust me, you 
will see a much healthier and 
more contented animal.” 

A gawky young keeper ap- 
peared at his elbow, holding out 
a package. Griick turned in an- 
noyance. “Yes? What is it?” 
“Pardon me, Herr Doktor,” said 
the young fellow, blushing and 
stammering, “but Freda, that is, 
your honored secretary, asked me 
to bring this straight up. She said 
you would want to see it at once.” 
Griick accepted the parcel 
with a humorous shrug and a 
glance around at the company, 
as if to say, “You see what my 
life is!” He turned the parcel over 
once or twice, glancing at the in- 
scriptions. 

All at once he gave a start of 
interest. “By the packet from Xi 
Bootes Alpha! From Purser Bang! 



Excuse me, gentlemen, this really 
may be important.” He began to 
tear open the wrappings impa- 
tiently. Inside was a sheaf of pa- 
pers. Griick examined the first 
sheet intently. 

“Yes, the report of the research 
team on Brecht’s Planet. Now we 
shall discover something!” He 
turned a page, then another. “Yes, 
they have dissected three bipeds, 
a male and two females. .” He 
fell silent, reading one. After a 
moment, his jaw dropped in sur- 
prise. He glanced up at the" cu- 
rious faces around the table. 

“But ... it says that the males 
are females, and the females are 
males!” Griick frowned. “But it’s 
impossible!” he muttered. 

“What’s that you say?” Neu- 
mann demanded. “The females 
are males, and the males fe- 
males? That doesn’t make sense, 
Herr Doktor. What, are they her- 
maphrodites? Then why not say 
so?” 

“No . no . .” answered 
Griick abstractedly, still reading. 
“My God, we have all made a 
serious mistake! Just look here, 
see what it says!” He held out a 
page, pointing to one paragraph 
with a thick, trembling finger. 

Neumann took the paper, held 
it to the light and read slowly, 
“The inguinal glands, previously 
thought to be male gonads, have 
been found to be without connec- 
tion with the reproductive sys-

tem, and their function remains 
unknown. It has been suggested 
that they are merely organs of 
display, analogous to the wat- 
tles and comb of the terrestrial 
cock. However, it must again be 
emphasized that the bearer of 
these organs is the female, not the 
male of the species. It is she who 
carries the young in a placental 
sac and gives live birth. Impreg- 
nation, however, is achieved by 
an extremely unusual method. 
The male gametes are carried in 
the purplish-red frontal organ 
which appears in developed form 
only in the adult male. During 
rut, the female . .’ Good heavens, 
Griick, just listen to this . .” 

17'RITZ and Emma were sitting 
side by side in the cot in her 
inner room — Emma tensely, with 
her hands tightly covering her 
knob, the biped leaning toward 
her, an arm around her body, 
speaking earnestly into her ear. 

“You know, Emma, that I 
didn’t mean any harm. You do 
believe it, don’t you?” 

“It isn’t that,” she said in a 
muffled voice. “It’s the way they 
all treat me — as if I were only an 
animal. They say I am not hu- 
man, and so it is correct to keep 
me in a cage all my life.” She 
looked up. “But what is it to be 
human? I think, I have feelings, 
I talk. I even type their letters 
for them, and still it’s not enough.” 



Her slender body shivered. “It’s 
bad enough to hear them talk 
about me as if I were some crea- 
ture that couldn’t speak or hear. 
But when you — ” 

“Emma, don’t, please,” said the 
biped, overcome by tenderness 
and remorse. “Of course you’re 
right, you’re as human really as 
any of them. What does it matter 
if you have a different shape? 
It’s the mind inside, the soul that 
counts, isn’t it? Why can’t they 
understand that?” 

She looked up again. “Do you 
really — ” 

“Of course,” said the biped, 
hugging her closer. Warm, new 
emotions were coursing through 
him. “Some day they must all 
see it, Emma. We’ll make them 
listen, you’ll see. There, Emma. 
It’s going to be all right. We’re 
friends now, aren’t we?” 

She looked up again, timidly. 
Her body stopped shivering. “Yes, 
Fritz,” she said. 

The biped hugged her still 
closer. Along with the protective- 
ness he felt, there was a fierce 
joy, a sense of rightness. For 
some moments they did not 
speak. 

“Emma?” 

“Yes?” 

“We’re really friends now? 
You’re not afraid of me any 
more?” 

“No, not any more, Fritz.” 
“Then why keep your hands 



88 



GALAXY 



over your knob? Isn’t it uncom- 
fortable? Don’t you trust me?” 

She shook her head. “I don’t 
know why . it’s just — Of 
course, I trust you, Fritz.” 

“Well then.” 

After a moment’s hesitation, 
she dutifully lowered her hands 
to her lap. Her knob was large, 
purplish-red, and had a faint spicy 
scent. 

“Now isn’t that better? Has 
anything dreadful happened be- 
cause you uncovered it?” 

“No, Fritz,” she said. She laid 
her muzzle against his shoulder. 
“I feel so much better now.” 

“So do I, Emma. Oh, so do I.” 
Bursting with emotion, the biped 
bent his head closer; and with an 
instinctive deftness which took 
thgm both by surprise, he bit her 
knob off.

fT'HE WORLD vanished, leav- 
ing a greenish glow. The 
young man became aware of his 
body, cramped into the cush- 
ioned seat. 

Around him in the great bowl, 
other figures were stirring. 

His buttocks were numb and 
his head ached. He struggled to 
his feet. It was hard to become 
used to the silence, and the small- 
ness of things. 

Reeling, dizzy, he came out 
into the hot afternoon sunlight. 



He passed the bakery with its 
gigantic, fragrant stereo-loaf for- 
ever swelling over the doorway. 
Three dark-skinned men in fun- 
ny little white hats and baggy 
white trousers came toward him, 
all talking at once in a foreign 
language. 

A cat ran across the plaza, pur- 
sued by something small and 
green, with many scuttling legs. 
The sun was hot on the paving 
stones; heat waves swam in the 
air. 

At the next corner, a crowd 
had gathered around a little man 
in green and a gigantic, barrel- 
chested creature with sparse 
pinkish feathers, which the little 
man held by a leash. Coins tin- 
kled in a cup. Prodded by its 
owner, the huge creature did a 
clumsy, shuffling dance. Its face 
was part human, part jelly-fish, 
moronic and blank. “Thank you, 
sir, thank you, lady,” said the lit- 
tle man, tipping his cap. Tinkle. 
“Thank you, sir.” 

The young man kept walking. 
After all, in the cinema one saw 
bigger monsters than that. 

He paused at the newsstand at 
the end of the plaza, bought the 
Berliner Zeitung and the Ham- 
burger Tageblatt, folded the crisp 
sheets pleasurably under his arm. 
The next stall was a fruit stand. 
The young man passed it nearly 
every day, and sometimes bought 
bananas or oranges. But today it 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO 



89 



was different. In the middle of 
the stall was a mound of green- 
ish-yellow ovoids, bigger than 
pears, with a sign: “Special! Just 
arrived from Brecht’s Planet! Un- 
usual! Try one!” The price was 
1 mark 10. 

The young man’s mouth went 
dry with excitement. From 
Brecht’s Planet! He fumbled in 
his pocket. He had just enough. 

The bored attendant took his 
money, handed him one of the 
greenish fruits. The young man 
held it carefully as he walked 
away. It was heavy, warm and 
waxy to the touch. 

A phrase from his lost book 
came back to him : “Certain 

greenish fruits, which the bipeds 
eat with avidity . .” 

Never before had he felt so 
close to the planet of his birth. 
It had always been a little un- 
real to him, something one read 
about in books. Now, for the first 
time, he felt that it really existed, 
that it was made up of real stones 
and dirt, and had real trees on it 
bearing real fruit. 

Catching sight of Frau Bei- 
felder in the building lobby, her 
little red eyes watchful and sus- 
picious as always, the young man 
instinctively slipped the heavy 
fruit into his pocket, but he kept 
his hand on it. 

“Good afternoon, Frau Bei- 
felder,” he said politely, crossing 
to the elevator. The old woman 



did not reply but merely nar- 
rowed her eyes still further. 

The young man stopped the 
elevator at every floor, as usual, 
peering curiously at the closed 
red doors. Julia’s door stood ajar, 
but instead of stopping, he went 
on up in the elevator, fourth 
floor, fifth, sixth. He got out, 
trotted over to the little stair, 
climbed to the roof. 

Berlin lay spread out around 
him in the hot summer sunlight. 
The curved threads of the Flug- 
bahnen glittered against the blue. 
Over there, rising out of a cluster 
of lower rooftops, bulged the 
golden dome of the Konzertge- 
baude. , 

A cool breeze was blowing 
steadily across the roof, making 
the newspapers flap against his 
arm. The young man gripped 
them in annoyance, not wanting 
to relinquish the warm fruit in 
his hand. A few meters away, a 
ventilator was turning rapidly 
under its little black hood. The 
young man turned his attention 
to an airplane soaring over the 
blue-gray horizon. He sniffed the 
air with interest: Diesel fuel, 

ozone, hot concrete. 

On the parapet a large butter- 
fly or moth was lying feebly mov- 
ing its blue-and-purple wings. 
The young man examined it curi- 
ously. It did not seem able to fly. 
When he prodded it with his 
finger, it merely went on with the 



90

u 





slow, spasmodic movements of its 
wings. 

Something landed with a faint 
thud behind him, and he turned 
to see another butterfly, identi- 
cal to the first. It lay quivering 
for a moment, then began the 
same slow, feeble motions. Sud- 
denly the young man realized 
that the air was full of them: 
tiny dark shapes drifting down, 
landing on the rooftops all a- 
round. There were a half a dozen 
at his feet, then twice as many. 
One struck him a limp, soft blow 
on the neck before it dropped to 
the roof. 

Annoyed, the young man 
turned to leave; but although he 
picked his way carefully to the 
stair entrance, he could not avoid 
crushing several of the brittle 
bodies under his feet. 

TTE GOT OFF at the third 
floor again and opened the 
door cautiously. Julia kept it un- 
latched now, usually, because he 
had had so much trouble with 
keys. Inside, all was quiet. 

Maggie, the cat, strolled up to 
greet him with a querulous sound. 
The young man dropped to all 
fours to touch noses with her. 
Her nose was wet and cold. She 
rubbed her face against his, arch- 
ing her back and twitching her 
tail. 

A moment later there was a 
sound from the bedroom and 



Churchill came out, looking dan- 
gerous. When he saw it was only 
the young man, the mad glare 
left his eyes. He waddled up and 
sniffed, then caressed the young 
man’s face with his ill-smelling 
tongue. 

The young man got up and 
wiped his face with a tissue. 

“Martin?” came a sleepy voice 
from the bedroom. 

The young man went down 
the hall and peered in through 
the doorway. Julia was looking 
sleepily at him from the bed. 
“What time is it?” 

The young man glanced at his 
wristwatch. “Nearly three o’clock. 
Are you feeling better, Julia?” 

“Yes, I think so. Would you 
mind bringing me a drink of 
water?” 

“Not at all, dear Julia.” The 
young man trotted into the kitch- 
en and filled a glass. 

He sat on the bed to watch her 
drink it, feeling rather peculiar. 
It was the first time he had ever 
been invited into her bedroom. 
Once before, he had happened to 
look in while she was undressing, 
and had seen her naked breasts, 
which interested him very much, 
but made him feel so odd that he 
had run out of the apartment. 
Now he could see their round 
shapes under the thin white 
nightdress she wore, and out of 
curiosity he touched one. It was 
soft and swinging, but had a hard 



protrusion of another color in the 
middle. 

“Oh!” she said, looking startled; 
her hand went v.p to grasp his. 

“Did I hurt you?” 

“No . no, it’s all right, Mar- 
tin. Touch them if you like.” She 
set the glass down and taking 
both his hands, guided them to 
her breasts. 

“Dear Martin,” she said. He 
saw that her eyes were bright 
with tears. 

“Dear Julia.” Leaning over, he 
kissed her. For a first attempt, it 
was not at all bad; the noses 
went to one side of each other, 
which he had always thought 
would be very difficult. 

The woman’s breath caught; 
after a moment her arms went 
around him, held him tightly. 
The kiss continued, and after a 
short time, other interesting 
things began to happen. 

When it was over, the young 
man lay on his back, exhausted 
and astonished. Julia was sitting 
up, brushing her hair and hum- 
ming quietly to herself. 

Suddenly the door-light 
flashed. They looked at each 
other. “Oh, dear, who can that 
be?” 

“I’ll go and see.” 

“Darling!” said the woman, 
holding out her hand to stop him, 
half weeping, half laughing: 
“First put your clothes back on.” 

“Oh.” The young man kissed 



her again, because she looked so 
rosy and contented, then got 
dressed. The door-light flashed 
repeatedly. “All right, I’m com- 
ing, I’m coming,” he muttered. 

In the hall stood a medium- 
sized man in a gray summer sur- 
coat, puffing a cigar. “Well, 
Naumchik?” he said smiling. 

“Yes?” asked the young man 
uncertainly. 

“Don’t you know me? Tassen, 
of the Freie Presse — remem- 
ber?” 

“No. Herr Tassen? What do 
you want?” 

“I was passing by,” said Tas- 
sen, looking him over with 
shrewd, friendly eyes. “So this is 
where you’re holed up? Mind if 
I come in a moment?” 

“Well — I suppose not.” The 
young man backed away uncer- 
tainly, and Tassen followed him, 
looking around the apartment 
with interest. 

rpHERE WAS a bellow from 
the bedroom, then the sound 
of claws scratching frantically a- 
gainst the closed door, followed 
by Julia’s muffled voice: “Church- 
ill, stop it! Bad dog!” 

Tassen cocked an eyebrow to- 
ward the sounds but made no 
comment. “Well, this is a cozy 
place, Naumchik. I won’t keep 
you a moment. You won’t mind 
if' I sit down, I suppose?” 

“Please.”

“Seen anything of Zellini late- 
ly?” 

“Please?” 

Tassen frowned, tapped his 
cigar into an ashtray. “Have you 
been back to Paris at all — since 
the — ?” He raised his eyebrows 
again. 

“To Paris?” asked the young 
man, confused. “No.” 

“I suppose you know they’ve 
tied a rocket to you?” 

“Pardon?” 

“Discharged you — given you 
the sack.” 

“Oh. No, I didn’t know it.” 
Tassen drew on his cigar, star- 
ing at the young man. After a 
moment he asked, “Just what 
happened to you, anyhow, Naum- 
chik? One moment, as far as I 
understand, you were a perfectly 
regular young newspaperman — 
then that biped business, and 
next, you were swinging from the 
ceilings in Elektra. I gather 
you’re all right now.” 

“Oh, yes, perfectly.” 

“Well?” 

“Well?” 

Tassen looked baffled and 
faintly annoyed. “Of course, if 
you don’t want to discuss it with 
me — ” 

“But I don’t remember.” 
“Oh?” Tassen blinked. “What 
don’t you remember?” 

“Anything — before Elektra.” 
“I see. So that’s it. Then you’re 
not likely to tell me what you 



were up to with that biped, are 
you?” 

“No.” 

“I see that. Well, anyhow, 
Naumchik, it’s good to know 
you’re on your feet again. I take 
it you haven’t been doing any 
journalistic work lately?” 

“No.” 

“Want to do any?” 

“I hadn’t thought about it,” 
the young man said. 

“Not too easy for you to get 
a job on any of the Berlin papers, 
after that stunt, probably,” said 
Tassen. “But you might get some 
free-lance work. Do a feature on 
your experiences in Elektra — 
why not?” He stood up, took a 
card from his surcoat pocket. 
“Here’s my address. If I can be 
any help — ” 

With a cheerful wave, he was 
gone. 

On the following day, the 
young man remembered the fruit 
from Brecht’s Planet, and de- 
cided to open it before it should 
spoil. The greenish-yellow rind 
was quite thin; inside was a 
rather sickly-looking yellow pulp. 
Julia ate a slice and pronounced 
it interesting. The young man, 
however, took one bite and im- 
mediately spat it out: the pulp 
was soft and unpleasant, with a 
distinct rancid flavor. The dis- 
appointment was so acute that 
he mourned for days. 

The good weather lasted until 



October; then it turned blustery 
and cold, with snow and occa- 
sional flurries of sleet. On an eve- 
ning in late November, the young 
man entered the bar of the Cor- 
respondents’ Club. He stood for 
a moment, shaking melted snow 
from his hat. The long mahogany 
bar was half deserted; the 
hooded bar lights were reflected 
in the mirrors, and the little 
green telephone lights glowed 
down the bar. 

Emile, the bartender, a red- 
faced Saxon, raised an eyebrow 
in greeting as the young man 
approached. 

“Good evening, Herr Naum- 
chik. We haven’t seen you in 
some time.” 

“No, I’ve been in Westphalia, 
Emile. Give me a double Long 
John.” 

“Yes, sir.” Emile reached be- 
hind him for the bottle, poured 
a glass brimming full. He leaned 
nearer to remark, “There was a 
call for you earlier, Herr Naum- 
chik. A lady.” 

“Oh? Did she give her name?” 

“No, sir. If she calls again, 
shall I say you are here?” 

The young man reflected. 
“Might as well. I wonder who it 
is, Nina? Olga? What sort of a 
looking woman was she, Emile?” 
he asked, but the stout bar- 
tender had already moved away 
and was cupping an ear toward 
another customer. 



“Hello, Naumchik, when did 
you get in?” A tall man wearing 
tweeds and a Tyrolean hat edged 
in beside him at the bar. He 
spoke in a thick English accent. 
By a short leash he held a slim, 
silkenhaired greyhound with 
great mournful eyes. The dog 
nudged his cold nose into the 
young man’s palm. 

“Oh, hello, Potter.” The young 
man slapped absently at the 
dog’s muzzle. “Just this morning. 
Down, Bruno. Should have been 
two o’clock last night, but we 
were stacked up five hours over 
Templehof.” 

“Terrible weather,” said Pot- 
ter. “Anything to that regenera- 
tion story?” 

“No, it was a frost, but I got 
a couple of columns out of it 
anyway. You look all right. I 
heard you’d broken your arm at 
Riga.” 

“No, that was Merle,” said the 
man, motioning with his chin to 
a corner table, where a blonde 
young woman sat with one arm 
in a sling. She lifted her glass 
and smiled. 

“Oh, too bad,” said the young 
man, returning the gesture. 

“It’s all right. Makes her more 
manageable. Sometimes I wish 
they’d all break their arms, or 
legs, or something.” 

A perspiring young man in 
black came by and clutched the 
Englishman’s arm. “Look here, 



THE VISITOR AT THE ZOO

Potter, do you know where I can 
find Johnny Ybarra?” 

“No, no idea — have you tried 
the brothels?” 

“All of them?” asked the sweat- 
ing man despairingly over his 
shoulder as he hurried out. “Hel- 
lo, Naumchik,” he added just be- 
fore he disappeared. 

Emile, who had been speaking 
into the hooded telephone at the 
end of the bar, looked up and 
raised his eyebrows. The young 
man nodded. Emile pressed a 
key, and the handset in front of 
the young man lighted up. 

“Excuse me, Donald. Hello — 
oh, it’s you, Julia!” 

The tiny face in the screen 
looked up at him with a smile. 
“How lucky to catch you, Mar- 
tin! I called just on the chance 
of finding — Can you come for 
dinner?” 

“Let me think. Yes — no, con- 
found it, I’ve got to have dinner 
with Schenk. I’m sorry, Julia, I 
forgot.” 

“It’s a pity. I’d love to see you, 
Martin.” She looked up at him 
wistfully. 

“So would I. Maybe I could 
meet you somewhere tomorrow 
for cocktails . .” The young man 
reflected that although Julia was 
a bit old for him, and he had no 
intention of starting that up all 
over again, still there was no get- 
ting around the fact that he had 
many pleasant memories of that 



little flat on the Heinrichstrasse, 
where he had written his first 
story on Julia’s little portable — 

/ Was Elektra’s Climbing Enig- 
ma, by Martin Naumchik. How 
proud they had both been when 
they saw it printed in the paper! 
Everything since had stemmed 
from that . “How is Churchill?” 
“I had to give him away, Mar- 
tin. He was becoming so surly; 
he bit a good friend of mine.” 
“Too bad. But you still have 
Maggie?” 

“Yes, Maggie is fine.” 

Down the bar, three men in 
plastic surcoats were tossing 
coins into a metal tub which 
stood before a stereo of a plump 
young woman in Bavarian peas- 
ant costume. Each time a coin 
fell into the tub, the girl turned 
slowly around and lifted her 
skirts, displaying her bare bot- 
tom; each time this happened, 
the three men burst into roars of 
coarse laughter. 

Potter touched him on the 
shoulder and mouthed, “Good- 
by;” the young man turned, 
waved. 

“Well, Martin, do call me if 
you can.” 

“Yes, I’ll do that. Tomorrow, 
sometime in the afternoon. You’re 
still at the Ministry?” 

“Still there.” 

“Fine, I’ll call you. Good-by.” 
The pathetic face in the tele- 
phone screen winked out. Sigh-

ing with regret and relief, the 
young man replaced the handset. 

A • PLUMP young man in a 
brown jacket took Potter’s 
place at the bar. He had a brist- 
ly, unkempt mustache and pro- 
truding blue eyes, and somehow 
managed to look both innocent 
and dissolute. 

“Hello, Naumchik.” 

“Hello, Wallenstein.” 

The plump man signaled to 
the bartender. “Emile, a Black 
Wednesday. Listen, Naumchik, 
you may be just the man I want. 
You know Kohler, the fellow 
who runs that string of provincial 
weeklies?” 

“Yes, what about him?” 

“Well, it’s ridiculous — I owe 
the man a favor — I promised 
I’d cover that Zoo story for him 
tomorrow. Then what should 
happen, but UPI offers me a 
plush assignment in Oslo. Two 
months, all expenses, best hotels. 
Well, I mean to say! But I’ve got 
to leave in the morning or it’s no 
go. You wouldn’t mind, would 
you, Naumchik — take you just 
half an hour — I’d even throw 
in a bit out of my own pocket.” 
“Hold on a minute, I’ve lost 
you. What Zoo story?” 

“Oh, one of their bipeds has 
given birth, and Kohler wants to 
play it up for the farm audience. 
What do you say?” 

“Well, I suppose there’s no rea- 



son — ” the young man began, 
then suddenly stopped. What a 
curious sensation! Out of the 
depths of his memory floated the 
picture of a two-legged creature 
scrabbling against the glass wall 
of a cage, while he, outside in the 
cold air, looked with amazement 
at his pink, five-fingered hands. 
How odd. It was the first time in 
months he had even thought of 
it. 

“Well? It’s agreed?” 

“No, on second thought, I don’t 
believe it would be advisable,” 
said the young man. 

“Not advisable? What do you 
mean? Come on, old fellow, I’ll 
put in ten of my own on top of 
Kohler’s twenty — now how’s 
that?” 

Naumchik drained his glass 
quickly, set it down. “No, I’m 
sorry,” he said. “I’ve just remem- 
bered, I’ve got to be somewhere 
else tomorrow.” He clapped the 
plump young man on the back. 
“Well, you’ll find someone, I’m 
sure. So long, Wallenstein. 

The plump man pouted at him. 
“Well, then, if you want to be 
a bastard.” 

“I do,” said Martin Naumchik 
cheerfully. “Aren’t we all? Keep 
it clean, old man.” He walked 
out, whistling. On the threshold 
he paused to breathe deep. The 
snow had stopped. The stars 
were crystal bright over the roof- 
tops. — DAMON KNIGHT

His colony was doomed, yet the 
people were unafraid. He could 
not understand — and never would!

'T'HE WIND swept down from 
the hills and passed across 
the field. The white foliage rip- 
pled and swirled. Nathaniel Bev- 
erage stood waist deep in the 
midst of the gleaming, pointed 
leaves and watched the ebb and 
flow of the plant-waves. The set- 
ting sun was at his back, but the 
white leaves were blinding even 
through the dark green filter he 
wore. Round spots, slick and 
shiny, dotted the dead whiteness 
of the leaves. Whenever the sun 
caught one just right it flashed 
with the brightness of a speck of 
hellfire. Beverage squinted against 
the dancing spots of brilliance. 
He grunted. Soon the shiny spots 
on each leaf would grow and fuse 
together to cover the entire leaf, 
and it would be time for the 
harvest. 

He turned and looked into the 
sun. Far down the valley, as far 



as the eye could see, stretched 
the shimmering whiteness, reach- 
ing between the hills like a rest- 
less glacier. In the middle dis- 
tance the whiteness took on a 
bluish cast from the ozone, and 
Beverage gauged its itensity with 
a practiced eye. He grunted 
again. The ozone was high, de- 
spite the wind. Must be six-seven 
hundred parts per million over 
the fields. The plants were ripen- 
ing fast; harvest would be sooner 
than anyone had expected. 

He felt a rasping at the base 
of his throat, and instinctively he 
squeezed his mask. It was dry. 
He knew he ought not to be here 
in the croplands without a field 
mask. Some ozone was getting 
through. 

He turned and began to walk 
the half mile across the field, 
moving slowly, not breathing 
deeply. The irritation in his mind 
began to match the irritation in 
his throat. Tomorrow the rocket

from Earth was due, and Rad- 
muck would be on it. Beverage 
felt again the sinking feeling in 
the pit of his stomach as he 
thought of Radmuck. Why was 
the man coming? Did he know 
something? 

He tried to turn his mind to 
more pleasant things, but he 
couldn’t think of them. He knew 
how it would be when he got 
back to the Crushing Plant and 
told them that the harvest in this 
field would be sooner than ex- 
pected. They would ask how he 
knew, and he would have to ex- 
plain. Everywhere it was the 
same, back on Earth and here on 
Iros. A man could not merely do 
the right thing or say the right 
thing, he also had to explain it. 
People insisted on talking so 
much. 

Beverage was a man whose 
tongue could never keep up with 
his mind, and so he said what 
had to be said, and did not try to 



say any more. He knew that he 
was disliked for his reticence. 

T>EVERAGE reached the edge 
of the field and climbed the 
gentle slope. At the door of the 
Crushing Plant he turned to look 
over the field. The ozone concen- 
tration where he stood was down 
to a normal 400 parts per mil- 
lion. He looked out over the gray 
and white landscape. Toward his 
left, along the forward slope of 
the hill, stretched a long row of 
processing domes, ending in the 
great Conveyor Dome from 
which the conveyor belt snaked 
up and over the crest of the hill 
toward the next valley where the 
landing field was. To his right 
stood the storage sheds flanked 
by row upon row of the huge 
harvesters. Beverage took a deep 
breath, and felt better. This was 
his doing, all this, and he was 
content. He had done the right 
thing in bringing all this about 
and neither Radmuck nor any- 
one else could change that. 

With a last proud look around 
Beverage turned and went 
through the outer door. Stepping 
up to the inner door he leaned 
against it to overcome the slight 
positive pressure inside the 
dome. The door suddenly gave 
way and he quickly walked 
through the outrushing current of 
air and allowed the door to slam 
shut behind him. He glanced at 



THE LONELY MAN 



99 



the big crusher rolls looming over 
him, and saw what was about to 
happen. The words formed in his 
mind, but he was unable to call 
out. So he stood, helplessly, and 
watched. 

Perched up on top of the high- 
est roll, twenty feet from the 
floor, sat Hal Close, carefully re- 
pairing a crack in the roll. Frank 
Jepp crouched behind the con- 
trol board, reaching around from 
behind it, constantly glancing up 
at Close to assure himself that he 
wasn’t seen. Just as Beverage en- 
tered, Jepp got the safety latch 
off, leaped around in front of the 
board and, with a shout of 
“Watch yourself, Hal,” spun the 
rheostat that started the rolls. 

Close, up on the top roll, bare- 
ly had time to jump to his feet 
as the great rolls started to turn 
under him. 

He began to run to maintain 
his position. The rolls revolved 
faster. A high-pitched yell — a 
residue of Close’s Virginia up- 
bringing — burst from his throat 
and he began that mad ride 
down the top rolls that Beverage 
had heard about but never seen. 
Flat on his stomach now, Close 
swiftly flowed down the top of 
the huge crusher, bridging the 
gaps between the rolls with his 
outstretched hands, and now and 
then repeating that piercing rebel 
yell. A hundred yards down the 
machine, just beyond the last 



roll, was a transverse supporting 
bar. Close launched himself at it, 
dangled for a moment, dropped 
to the belt beneath him, and 
rolled off onto his feet on the 
floor. He ambled back to the 
head of the crusher and said to 
Jepp, “Well, now, that was right 
neighborly of you to give me a 
lift off.” 

Jepp grinned up at Close. 
“Man, I never saw you move so 
fast in your life. You’re coming 
along, boy. You’re coming along. 
How about it, Doc?” This last to 
Beverage. “Think the squirt here 
is growing up?” 

The “squirt” stood six feet five 
in his stocking feet and was made 
out of whipcord and whalebone. 
Close happened to be the young- 
est man in the colony — a bare 
twenty-two, twenty years young- 
er than Beverage — and the oth- 
ers never let him forget it. 

Close said, “Squirt, huh?” And 
he snapped out an open hand in 
a straight-arm lunge that caught 
Jepp on the shoulder. Jepp tum- 
bled backwards to the floor. He 
slid to a halt and, from a posi- 
tion flat on his back, snapped out 
with both legs and landed lightly 
on his feet. He whirled, poised to 
leap at Close, a broad grin on his 
face. 

OEVERAGE had been trying to 
utter the words to call a halt 
to all this, but things had been 

GALAXY 



happening too fast; he was not 
the kind of man who could yell. 
Even now, with the immediate 
prospect of a rough-and-tumble 
mock fight confronting him, he 
was unable to frame the words 
that would stop it. Instead he 
stepped between the two men 
and raised a hand, palm outward, 
toward each. Close and Jepp 
laughed, joyous laughs ringing 
with physical exuberance. They 
came down from the balls of 
their feet and walked over to 
Beverage. Close clapped him on 
the back with what was meant 
to be a light-hearted pat, but it 
almost knocked him down. 

Close said, “Okay, Doc. I’ll fix 
him later. Everything under con- 
trol?” 

Beverage had been trying to 
enunciate a protest against 
Close’s blow, but the question re- 
minded him why he had come in 
here in the first place. “Oh, yes,” 
he said in his slow way. “Number 
two field is ripening ahead of 
schedule.” He paused. “It ought 
to be ripe in a day or two. The 
crusher here — ” 

He waved at the towering ma- 
chine. Before he could finish the 
sentence, Jepp broke in. “Ripe in 
a day or two, huh? What do you 
know. How’d you figure that, 
Doc?” 

Beverage was annoyed. He 
considered whether to finish his 
sentence or to reply to Jepp’s 

THE LONELY MAN 



question. At the same time an- 
other part of his mind raced on 
ahead, ticking off all the things 
that had to be done to insure a 
proper and speedy harvest. A 
myriad of details had to be 
watched over. The precipitation 
unit needed checking. There was 
premature precipitation. Prob- 
ably inadvertent seeding; prob- 
ably that lowest elbow in the 
feed line had collected a tiny 
nest of crystals, got to flush it 
out. Then there was. 

“Aw, Doc can tell just by look- 
ing at it.” It was Close. “That’s 
how you do it, isn’t it, Doc? Just 
by looking at it?” 

Beverage shook his head. “No. 
No, I can tell from the ozone 
concentration in the air above 
the fields. It is quite a bit higher 
than normal.” He prepared to 
explain that the normal blue cast 
to the atmosphere of Iros be- 
came even deeper as the pho- 
tosynthetic process reached a 
maximum and the release of 
ozone by the plants increased, 
particularly in the vicinity of the 
fields. But even as his tongue 
began to form the words, Bever- 
age knew he would never be able 
to make it. This inability to talk 
swiftly was what separated him 
from the others. These people sel- 
dom remained silent long enough 
to listen; they must always be 
talking or doing something vio- 
lent. None had the patience to 



100 



101 



listen to a man whose speech was 
careful and methodical. He was 
apart. 

Close was talking, as Beverage 
knew he would. “Well, that’s 
looking at it, or smelling it. Same 
thing really. That’s ’bout the only 
way a man can tell.” 

“Sure,” said Jepp. He glanced 
at the mask at Beverage’s belt. 
“He wasn’t wearing a field mask 
out in the field. That’s how he 
smelled it, right through the 
mask.” 

There it was, and Beverage 
felt the familiar sense of frustra- 
tion build up. They had caught 
him, again, not obeying the rules. 
They might not be particularly 
well-trained technically, but they 
certainly were quick witted. 
Young, strong, keen people in the 
odd atmosphere of Iros, and they 
seemed to grow younger, strong- 
er and keener. There was a bio- 
logical problem here that merit- 
ed study some day. Possibly the 
breathing of so much ozone in 
lieu of oxygen. 

Close said, “Well, we don’t 
worry none about Doc. He knows 
what he’s doing. He wants to 
wear a general mask out in the 
fields, he wears it. Nobody’s to 
tell him no.” 

“Oh, sure,” said Jepp. “He 
knows what he’s doing.” And the 
two young men stood nodding at 
each other. 

Beverage finally finished his 



sentence. “The crusher here 
ought to be ready to go by to- 
morrow morning.” 

“Don’t worry about a thing, 
Doc. It will be. Just so this midg- 
et here — ” Close nodded at the 
six-foot Jepp — “doesn’t try to 
run me through the rolls every 
five minutes. I’ll get right back 
on it.” He turned to leave, but 
then turned back and said, “Say, 
Doc. I almost forgot. They want 
you over at Extraction Number 
3 dome. They got some kind of 
a meeting going on over there.” 

Beverage said, “What is the 
meeting for?” 

“Doctor Radmuck called ahead 
and wants to talk to the whole 
colony as soon as he lands to- 
morrow. Everybody’s wondering 
what’s up.” 

Beverage considered what 
might happen at the meeting, 
knowing that he could no noth- 
ing to stop any uproar. A wise 
man knows his own limitations, 
and Beverage was a wise man. 
In a rousing shouting-type argu- 
ment he could never get a point 
across, never persuade. Slowly he 
turned to go to the meeting, won- 
dering what he should do after 
he got there. 

II 

T1EVERAGE suddenly turned 
-t^aside from the path traversing 
the side of the hill, and headed 



102 



GALAXY 



for the crest. He felt the need for 
refreshment of the spirit, and he 
knew he could find it at the crest. 

On the crest he looked down 
into the next valley at the flat 
and packed gray soil of the land- 
ing field. Tomorrow there would 
be another glossy fused patch to 
join the others that marred the 
even gray surface. Beverage 
hoped it would not be the last. 
From that field had gone hun- 
dreds of shipments of the anti- 
cholesterol moiety. The drug 
fraction went back to Earth to 
be fed into the maws of the 
chemical reactors. Out of the re- 
actors came the newest and best 
of the anti-cholesterol drugs, 
enough for the requisite one 
gram a month for every person 
on Earth over the age of twenty- 
five years. With it, the veins and 
arteries remained open and sup- 
ple, free of the rigid deposits that 
had stiffened the vessel walls and 
throttled the vessel openings. 
The blood pulsed unimpeded to 
the brain and the muscles and 
the organs,- easily supplying the 
four corners of the body with the 
stuff of tissues. To what end? 
Beverage shook his head. 

To the end that man might 
live longer. A man lived strong 
and fruitful for an average of 
300 years. But all mortal things 
must die. There came a time in 
this extended existence when the 
human fat became so depleted 



that it could no longer serve as a 
storehouse for the anti-choleste- 
rol drug. The guardian concen- 
tration in the bloodstream disap- 
peared suddenly. The organs 
continued their unheeding pro- 
duction of cholesterol. Quickly the 
body became clotted and glutted 
with crystals of cholesterol, and 
it was over. So accurately pre- 
dictable was the time of death 
that one could neatly arrange for 
a last round of farewell parties, 
parties at which the man of 25 
and the man of 300 were physi- 
cally indistinguishable, save, per- 
haps, for the air of detachment 
and reserve on the part of the 
older man. 

Beverage turned away from 
the landing field and stared out 
over the far-flung array of low- 
lying rounded hills. Everywhere 
the gray soil was dotted with 
grayish-white patches of natural 
vegetation. The setting sun was 
perched squarely on the horizon, 
yet the land was darker than one 
would expect. No sharp shadows 
appeared anywhere and there 
was none of the usual orange col- 
ors that went with sunset on 
Earth. The sight was stimulating 
to Beverage, and the familiar ex- 
ultant feeling welled through 
him. In one movement he swept 
the mask from his face and shook 
his head to free it from the feel- 
ing of the straps. This was where 
men belonged, out on alien soil 



THE LONELY MAN 



103 



seeking new ways to adapt and 
change and expand throughout 
the Universe, not sitting on the 
home planet and breeding into 
stultification. 

Beverage felt the sting in his 
eyes and the bite in his nose and 
throat. He breathed shallowly to 
prevent the ozone from penetrat- 
ing deep into his lungs. Often he 
had moments of doubt about 
how he had brought this about 
but when he stood here like this 
the doubt washed away. This was 
his doing, this colony. Men could 
live here and make their exist- 
ence worth while, even enjoy it. 
And all because of the early 
work of the young chemist, Na- 
thaniel Beverage. 

“I think you better try to hire 
him, even if he did just get out 
of school. Look here. His doctoral 
dissertation is entitled, Duplica- 
tion of the Photosynthetic Proc- 
ess in toto. Make him an offer, 
anyway. His name is Nathaniel 
Beverage.” 

“This fellow Beverage has cer- 
tainly come up with some new 
ideas in three months time. Give 
him a couple of assistants so he 
can chase them down.” 

“I don’t care if he has only 
been on the project for six 
months. He’s done more with 
those Iros specimens than any- 



one else around here in two 
years. Give him the title, too: 
manager of the Extraterrestrial 
Compound Division.” 

“Come in, Doctor Radmuck. I 
have good news for you. You are 
being promoted to the Board of 
Directors of the National Space 
Survival Institute, effective im- 
mediately. I’m sure you will . 
What? Oh, the new project direc- 
tor here will be Doctor Beverage. 
Yes, I know he’s young. Yes, I 
know he’s only been on Project 
Longevity for a year and a half. 
Yes, I know he has trouble mak- 
ing speeches. Yes, but . just 
look at how much he has accom- 
plished.” 

“. and so we meet here in 
Stockholm on an exceedingly spe- 
cial occasion. For the first time 
since the institution of the Prizes, 
the awards for chemistry and for 
physiology and medicine are be- 
ing given simultaneously to the 
same man. The human race need 
never again fear the effects of the 
anti-cholestrial drugs, thanks to 
Doctor Nathaniel Beverage. So 
it is with grateful hearts that 
we . .” 

“I hate to see you do it, Na- 
thaniel. I can’t help feeling that 
we need you here on Earth. But 
on the other hand, you are right 
when you say that we can put 



104 



GALAXY 



the anti-cholesterol drug out 
sooner if you are with the new 
colony. Another thing, I am cer- 
tain that I will have an easier job 
of persuading the United Nations 
to put up all that money if you 
are going to be in charge of the 
technology at the Iros colony. So 
I guess you’re right; as long as 
we have to grow that fraction of 
the drug on Iros, we need you 
there. Bless you, and let me wish 
you . .” 

OEVERAGE walked along the 
crest of the hill, picking his 
footing carefully among the tough 
white shrubs that grew wild there. 
He walked beneath the giant 
solar mirror, and he paused to 
watch it as it extracted the last 
waning fragments of heat from 
the setting sun. The glow of the 
boiler faded as he watched. His 
feet moved slower and slower as 
he drew closer to Extraction 
Number 3 dome, and he reluc- 
tantly went through the outer 
door. Inside the pressure lock he 
stripped off his mask and stood 
motionless listening to the rum- 
ble of loud voices coming through 
the inner door. It was easy to tell 
that the discussion had already 
started; in fact it was in full 
swing. Briefly he considered re- 
placing his mask and returning to 
his quarters, but he knew from 
experience that that was no so- 
lution; they would simply trans- 



fer the discussion to his quarters, 
and then he would never get 
them out. With a sigh that was 
too deep for the ozone-rich air — 
it burned his throat — he leaned 
his weight against the inner door 
and forced it open. 

The rumble of voices turned 
into a roar, but then all were 
suddenly silent as one voice called 
out, “Hey, here’s Doc. Ask him. 
Go on, just ask him.” 

Two figures detached them- 
selves from the edge of the crowd 
and swung to Beverage’s side. 
Gently but swiftly they hustled 
him into the center of the surging 
group, and one of them said, 
“You tell us, Doc. What’s Rad- 
muck got on his mind?” 

Beverage was amazed at their 
acuity. Not only did they sense 
that something was very wrong, 
but they came to him for an ex- 
planation. They had hit on the 
one person who could tell them 
of the probable disaster that 
would follow Radmuck’s visit. 
But as long as there was any 
chance at all that Radmuck might 
be coming on an innocuous mat- 
ter, Beverage had to keep silent. 

The man said again, “What’s 
it all about, Doc?” 

Beverage said, “I don’t know. 
I don’t know.” 

The man shrugged and turned 
away. “Well, if you’re not wor- 
ried, don’t see why we should be. 
Guess there’s no use getting all 



THE LONELY MAN 



105 



stewed up about nothing. Let’s 
go back to work.” He walked off. 

Beverage wondered if he 
should say something to prepare 
them for what might happen. But 
he didn’t know what was best, 
and they were all walking away. 

A voice said beside him, “Are 
you sure there isn’t something 
you should tell us, Nathaniel?” 

Beverage turned and saw Ur- 
sula Doddard. He started to say 
hello to her but he felt his face 
flush, and the words choked him. 
Then he realized she had asked a 
question. He shook his head. 

She said, “I see. Well, I hope 
everything is all right.” She shook 
her head, tilting it back as she 
did so. 

She wore her hair long, unlike 
most of the other girls in the 
colony. It was a glowing brown, 
and as she shook her hair the red 
highlights in its flashed and 
gleamed in the light from the 
overhead bulb. Beverage was in- 
terested in the flashing effect. He 
had noted it before. He wondered 
what caused it. Possibly the nat- 
ural hair oils tended to concen- 
trate at a region a certain length 
from the follicle, resulting in 
areas of excess oil which natural- 
ly reflected. 

“Are you going to do anything 
to get ready for tomorrow?” asked 
Ursula Doddard. 

“What? Oh, yes.” Suly Dod- 
dard was at it again. Always 



seemed to be suggesting things 
for him to do. She was a pretty 
girl, round where the others were 
lean, and she did not walk as 
much like a man. Beverage liked 
to be near her, except that she 
always seemed to suggest things 
for him to do. As if he did not 
know what had to be done. Fur- 
thermore, he always felt a little 
uncomfortable in her presence, 
except that now and then when 
she was quiet she seemed to un- 
derstand that he wanted to think, 
and he was content. Now, though, 
he felt irritated; she was picking 
at him again. 

U RSULA DODDARD raised 
her arm and smoothed the 
hair at the back of her neck. The 
sleeves of her coverall were push- 
ed up above the elbow. Her bare 
right forearm glowed in the light, 
and on the underside of her fore- 
arm Beverage could see a quarter- 
inch brown wart. Instantly all his 
irritation vanished. One little 
blemish perched on an otherwise 
perfect and completely feminine 
forearm, and Beverage unac- 
countably felt his heart warm to 
her. Because of that minor im- 
perfection he felt that he was on 
equal footing with her. He need 
not be concerned with his own 
shortcomings; after all, she too 
was marred. He felt expansive 
and completely at ease. 

“Suly,” he said. “I don’t know 



what will happen tomorrow, but 
whatever it is, we can’t let it 
have any effect on the colony. 
This is a good life and we don’t 
want to ruin it. Men belong on 
planets like this. Earth is begin- 
ning to stagnate. I’m convinced 
that the future of men lies in 
colonies like this one. If we con- 
tinue to send the anti-cholesterol 
drug back to Earth we will be. 

. By the way. The Main Valley 
will be ready to harvest in a day 
or two. It’s running a good week 
ahead of schedule. Can’t under- 
stand it, either, unless that new 
fertilizer I tried had something 
to do with it. Maybe that was a 
good idea at that. Used metal fil- 
ings, you see, with sodium chlo- 
ride. Small scale tests indicated 
that the ozone would form an ac- 
tive oxide which would react with 
sodium chloride and form a solu- 
ble metallic chloride. Then the 
sodium would keep the soil alka- 
line. By golly, that must be it.” 
And Beverage plopped his right 
fist into his right hand, nodding, 
smiling. Gradually, he became 
conscious of the fact that Ursula 
was watching him, wide-eyed. He 
dropped his hands to his side and 
looked at her, and flushed. 

She said softly, “I love it when 
you talk like that, Nathaniel. 
Tell me some more about it, 
please.” 

Beverage smiled and got ready 
to speak again. But then he 



remembered something. Ursula 
Doddard was a mechanic. She 
maintained the pumps used for 
the heated alkaline water sprays 
that removed the ozone from the 
domes. She was not a chemist. 
She could not understand what 
he was talking about. The reali- 
zation threw him into confusion. 
He began to back away, saying 
as he went, “I’ve, uh, got to go. 
I, uh. Good-by.” He turned 
and ran out the lock. He was 
twenty yards out into the atmos- 
phere before the bite in his eyes 
and throat reminded him to put 
on his mask. 

Beverage stood still while he 
waited for the smarting in his 
eyes to go away. It was dark, and 
the landscape appeared ghostly 
in the dim starlight. The plant- 
filled valley below him looked 
more than ever like a rippling 
river of snow. Overhead the stars 
gleamed faintly against the black 
sky, waxing and waning in a pe- 
riod of twinkling appreciably 
greater than that seen from 
Earth. The gentle slope on which 
Beverage stood was a looming 
blackness broken with vague 
patches of gray where the white 
stands of vegetation grew. High- 
er on the slopes were the glowing 
domes, looking like taut bubbles 
about to burst and spew their 
contents into the atmosphere. 
Beverage felt at ease as he 
looked at them. He looked his 



106 



GALAXY 



THE LONELY MAN 



107 



fill, then he went up to his own 
dome to bed. 

D AWN came brisk and blue, 
and Beverage was soon up 
and out in it. At the Mess dome 
the talk was all about the early 
harvest in the main field and the 
ship arrival. People kept asking 
Beverage about the early har- 
vest. He found himself constant- 
ly answering hosts of trivial 
questions: What made the field 
ripen so fast, Doc? How can you 
tell just by looking at it, Doc? 
Will it be a good crop, Doc? How 
do you know? 

Things began to happen fast 
after breakfast. The harvesting 
crews moved down into the main 
field with the great combines. 
Other crews moved to the land- 
ing field and began the job of 
bringing down the incoming ship. 
Beverage joined the later groups, 
and watched the ship come down. 

Bringing the ship in was a 
tricky operation on Iros. The 
technique called for the bare 
minimum of operational time for 
the braking jets, for the high 
ozone content of the atmosphere 
chewed away at the ceramic lin- 
ing of the jet exhausts. The trick 
was to get the ship on the ground 
before the liners were consumed, 
otherwise the exposed metal 
quickly took fire and burned out. 
Every space ship required a new 
set of liners after every landing 



and take-off in the Irosian atmos- 
phere. 

The ship put down safely. Rad- 
muck was the first one out. He 
was a thin man with a little mus- 
tache, and he walked with his 
head thrust out in front of him. 
His eyes darted over the waiting 
people and he quickly spotted 
Beverage. He walked to him im- 
mediately and held out his hand 
and said loudly, “Well, Nathaniel, 
how have you been? Are you 
waiting anxiously to see what I 
have to tell you?” Radmuck de- 
liberately asked two questions in 
the same breath. He knew Bev- 
erage well. 

Beverage considered which 
question to answer. He began to 
form the words regarding his 
health, but changed his mind 
when he realized that Radmuck 
did not really care. He then said, 
“No, I . .” But Radmuck had 
turned away and was talking 
with Sanchez standing nearby. 
He heard Radmuck ask about 
the meeting, and he heard San- 
chez explain that it had been 
called for right after lunch. Bev- 
erage shook hands with Captain 
Pike as he came off the ship, and 
then walked away to do the 
things that had to be done. 

The next few hours went by 
swiftly for Beverage. The early- 
ripening plants retained their 
juices more tenaciously than had 
the normal plants. As a result the 




crusher was not obtaining its nor- 
mal yield of juice, and the resi- 
dues were wetter than usual. 
Beverage solved the dilemma by 
adding 5 per cent of the buty- 
ronitrile solvent at the crusher 
instead of holding it all back for 
the extractor. The solvent-treat- 
ed residues then went into the 
butyronitrile extraction units al- 
ready wet with the solvent, and 
this increased extraction effi- 
ciency. 

Beverage was checking out the 
operation of the great extraction 
units when someone tapped him 
on the shoulder and told him it 
was time to go to the meeting. 

fJTIE DOME was crowded 

when he entered and every- 
body was talking at once. Ursula 
Doddard pushed her way to his 
side and sat down. 

Hal Close burst in through the 
door behind Beverage, stood with 
his head thrown back, and emit- 
ted a piercing rebel yell. It was 
so loud inside the dome that it 
hurt Beverage’s ears. Others re- 
sponded to it with weaker imita- 
tions, some clapped hands, others 
laughed. Beverage felt sick, un- 
able to respond to the holiday 
feeling generated by the gather- 
ing of the colony. The sick feeling 
became worse for Beverage as he 
realized his own incompetence 
and inability to deal with the 
developing situation. 



Ursula Doddard saw his face. 
She put a hand on his arm and 
asked, “What is the matter, Na- 
thaniel? Are you all right?” 
Beverage nodded, not able to 
form words. 

Sanchez walked into the mess 
dome followed by Radmuck. San- 
chez looked solemn. He walked 
to the center of the dome and 
stood motionless, obviously wait- 
ing for silence. The rumble of 
conversation in the dome cut off 
suddenly at the unusual conduct; 
Sanchez normally would have 
roared for silence, but he did not 
do so now. 

In the dead quiet Sanchez said, 
“Doctor Radmuck has something 
to say to us. I suggest you listen 
closely.” Radmuck wasted no 
words. 

“We know just how to synthe- 
size the anti-cholesterol fraction 
now. Earth doesn’t need Iros any 
more. There won’t be any more 
shipments from here; they’ll 
make it on Earth.” He looked 
around and smiled. 

The silence continued for a 
moment, and then after looking 
at each other, the seated people 
broke into a low buzz of conver- 
sation. Radmuck’s eyes sought 
and found Beverage, and for a 
moment they stared at each oth- 
er. It was Henry Jansen who 
raised his voice and asked the 
question: “Who was the bright 
boy that found out how to make 



108 



GALAXY 



THE LONELY MAN 



109 



it? Where’s he been all these 
years?” 

Beverage picked up his coffee 
cup and drained it; he knew what 
was coming next. Radmuck stared 
at Beverage a moment longer 
and then said, still in that low 
voice. “The process for making 
the fraction has been known for 
a long time, only it was kept a 
secret.” 

“What?” It was Sanchez. “You 
mean that somebody knew how 
to make the stuff all along, yet 
they let us come out here and 
set up a whole colony to grow 
it?” 

“Yes. Seems somebody left an 
envelope with the Boston Trust 
Company. On it was written ‘To 
be opened in the event that the 
anti-cholesterol drug raised on 
the planet Iros becomes unavail- 
able to Earth’, or something like 
that. Inside was the complete de- 
scription of how to synthesize the 
fraction. It was opened acciden- 
tally. It took a while to prove. 
But it’s done now, and they don’t 
need Iros any more.” 

“Who was it?” 

Now that the time had come 
Beverage felt no sensation what- 
soever. He was startled to find 
that his mind was clear and calm; 
there was none of the emotional 
upheaval he had expected. He 
could even be interested in what 
the response of his friends was 
going to be. 



Radmuck said, “Nathaniel Bev- 
erage,” and there was no longer 
anything to be concerned about. 

B everage sat toying with 
his empty coffee cup. The 
silence, which had been heavy 
before, now became overpower- 
ing. There was no need for Bev- 
erage to look up; he felt all eyes 
on him as if he sat under the heat 
of a thousand spotlights. Al- 
though he felt no inner turmoil, 
he was disturbed by what he was 
convinced was the cold chill of 
hostility that filled the room. 

Radmuck went out the door. 
The dome stayed quiet. 

“Would you like some more 
coffee, Nathaniel?” said Ursula. 
“No, thank you.” 

“I’ll just get you some any- 
way. It’ll be good for you.” She 
went into the back, threading her 
way among the silent people, and 
soon she returned with a cup of 
steaming black coffee. “Now sip 
this, and you’ll feel better.” 
Beverage nodded and touched 
the scalding fluid to his lips. He 
put the cup down and said quiet- 
ly, “Thank you, Suly. Thank you 
for behaving as if nothing has 
happened. 

“Why, there’s nothing to thank 
me for, Nathaniel. I thought you 
might want Some one to talk to 
while you think about what you 
have to do to keep the colony 
going.” 



Beverage stared at her. “Keep 
the colony going? Me?” 

“Certainly. You’ll think of 
something. Now drink your cof- 
fee.” 

Beverage did as he was told; 
the coffee scalded all the way 
down, and he choked on the heat 
of it. Ursula watched him, and 
he found that he was annoyed 
at her seeing him in such undig- 
nified straits. His face must have 
reflected his annoyance because 
she suddenly got up and said, 
“Well, you think about it, 
Nathaniel. I’ll stop over and see 
you later.” 

Beverage watched her walk 
out, feeling alone among all the 
others, wishing that he could call 
out and ask her to stay. She 
turned at the door to wave at 
him, and the simple gesture un- 
accountably made him feel warm 
and good. He waved back and 
watched her trim figure tighten 
as she tugged at the inner door. 
She flashed a smile just before 
the door slammed shut, and Bev- 
erage leaned back feeling at 
peace with the world. He sat 
wrapped in himself, estranged 
from his companions of many 
years, yet he felt pleased and at 
ease. 

Keep the colony going, she 
had said. Well, now, there was a 
problem. The only solution, ob- 
viously, was to find something 
that would keep the Earth ships 



coming to Iros, at least until the 
colony became self sufficient . 
Wups. How about that ozonized 
alloy? He had not thought about 
that in a couple of years, but it 
might be . 

He got up and walked past the 
quiet people and went straight to 
his laboratory and rummaged 
through his sample storage cabi- 
nets. He found a one foot square 
sheet of a thin metallic sub- 
stance. He tucked it under one 
arm, and took the long walk to 
the space ship. He went up to 
the watch officer, handed him the 
sheet, and said, “Give this to 
Captain Pike. Tell him to test it, 
tensile strength, elongation, flexi- 
bility, abrasive resistance, every- 
thing. Give it the works. Under- 
stand?” 

The officer nodded. Beverage 
returned to his laboratory and 
began thumbing through his 
notebooks. He began to grow 
sleepy, so he stretched out on the 
cot and fell sound asleep. He 
slept all night, waking just be- 
fore dawn. He continued working 
his way through the notebooks. 
He had not finished when Ursula 
came in. 

64T ET’S GO have some break- 
fast, Nathaniel,” she said. 
‘This will be a big day, and you 
must have something to eat.” 

He nodded absently. “Yes, by 
all means.”

She half led him out of the 
dome. He put on his mask auto- 
matically and trudged to the 
Mess dome like one asleep. He 
and Ursula sat at a table, and it 
took only a moment for him to 
realize that no one greeted him. 
The coldness hurt Beverage. 
Plaintively he looked around, but 
none would meet his eyes. The 
quietness distressed him now; he 
realized with surprise that he 
missed the usual hullaballoo that 
accompanied everything his 
friends did. 

He noticed Close and Jepp sit- 
ting side by side at the table 
across from him. He couldn’t be 
certain, but it seemed as if Close 
were guardedly watching him 
while seeming not to. He nodded 
and smiled at Close, but Close 
took no notice. Dejectedly Bev- 
erage turned to the food Ursula 
had placed in front of him and 
began to eat. It was tasteless in 
his mouth. 

Halfway through the meal 
Captain Pike burst in and stood 
just inside the door and looked 
around the room. He saw Bev- 
erage and swooped toward him. 
“Nathaniel! Where did you get 
this?” He dropped in front of 
Beverage the remnants of the 
metallic sheet that Beverage had 
delivered to the watch officer. It 
was smaller; strips had been 
sawed from it and holes had been 
punched in it. 



Beverage looked up. “I made 
it.” 

“You made . How?” 

“Put a silicon dioxide wash on 
a nickel steel, heated it to i n . 
candescence and air-quenched it.” 

The captain stared at him. 
“Can you do it again?” 

“Certainly." 

“Do you know what you’ve got 
here?” 

Beverage permitted himself a 
smile. “Yes, I do.” 

“Do you? Just listen to this.” 
The captain pulled a sheet of 
paper out of a pocket and read, 
“Tensile strength at room tem- 
perature, 486,000 pounds per 
square inch; at 1,000 degrees C. 
it’s 450,000 pounds per square 
inch. The stuff has a Young’s 
modulus at 1,000 degrees C. of 
just about one billion. The modu- 
lus of rigidity is three-quarters of 
a billion. We gave it a Charpy 
impact test and broke the ham- 
mer. The elastic ratio is one. 
Elongation at yield is 100 per 
cent. Good heavens, man, what 
is this stuff?” 

Beverage said, “It’s a new al- 
loy.” 

The captain stared at him. Be- 
hind him Beverage was vaguely 
aware that Close had expelled his 
breath and said in a booming 
whisper to Jepp, “Great day in 
the morning, he’s done it already. 
Pay me.” And Jepp rammed an 
elbow into Close’s ribs. 



The captain said, “Can you 
make a lot of this?” 

“I don’t know why not. Any 
structural nickel steel having a 
yield point of about 50,000 
pounds per square inch will do 
for a starting material. We’ve got 
lots of sand here, and lots of at- 
mosphere. The solar mirror ought 
to supply plenty of heat. That’s 
all we need.” 

Sanchez appeared at the cap- 
tain’s side and said, “This some- 
thing you think they can use on 
Earth, Harry?” 

“My god, yes! There’s nothing 
like this on Earth. The technical 
boys will go wild. Only . .” he 
turned to Beverage, “Why can’t 
they make this on Earth if you 
tell them how? Or have you al- 
ready told them?” 

Beverage considered which 
question he should answer first. 
“No, I haven’t told them.” He 
stopped to formulate his thoughts 
on the next question. 

The captain said, “But the 
steps you outlined are simple; 
they can carry them out on 
Earth too.” 

Ursula said, “Will you be quiet 
and let him talk?” 

The captain’s mouth fell open. 
Beverage took no notice of the 
exchange. He said, “You forget 
there is a difference between the 
air of Earth and the air of Iros.” 
The captain’s mouth stayed 
open. “Ozone,” he said. 



Bqyerage nodded. “Yes, ozone, 
When we heat a silica-covered 
sheet of steel here, and air- 
quench it, most of it burns away. 
What’s left is a mixture of metal- 
lic silicates and oxides that I 
haven’t been able to identify. 
The rate of heat loss on cooling 
is important too. I haven’t been 
able to duplicate it in a chamber; 
only an open-air quench will do 
it. They might be able to dupli- 
cate the process on Earth, but I 
don’t know how at the moment.” 
“Then,” said Sanchez loudly, 
“we’re in business again.” 

IV 

r | ''HE DOME broke into noisy 
turmoil. Loud and piercing 
over the noise came the rebel 
yell, and Beverage revelled in it. 
Things were back to normal. 
Only the captain stood silent and 
morose in the midst of the racket, 
biting his lower lip. Gradually his 
somberness spread, and soon they 
were quiet again, looking at him. 

As soon as it was quiet enough 
to speak he said, “Look, I hate to 
throw cold water on this, but I 
don’t see how it’s going to work.” 
“Why not?” said Sanchez. “The 
Doc says he can do it, and if he 
says so he can.” 

The captain shook his head. 
“It’s not that. It’s the weight 
problem. This may be the hottest 
alloy ever seen, but it isn’t a mat-

work long hours, we can do it.’ 





ter of life and death the way the 
drug was. These ships can only 
carry about eleven tons of pay- 
load. The cost will be so high it 
won’t be worth it, even for an 
alloy like this.” 

Beverage started to say some- 
thing, but Sanchez said, “Aw, 
come on, Harry. They won t pay 
for a thing like this?” 

Ursula said, “Will you two shut 
up and let Nathaniel speak?” 
This time Nathaniel fully real- 
ized that she had interceded for 
him. To his surprise he liked it. 
Right in front of everybody he 
said to her, “Thank you, Suly.” 
She reached out and patted his 
hand, and he squeezed it. Then 
he turned to the captain and 
said, “Your ship is sheathed with 



half-inch nickel steel. If we take 
off the sheathing and treat it by 
this process and then put it back, 
you’ll have one-sixth inch plates 
that are far stronger than your 
half inch plates now; that’ll save 
a lot of weight. Also, you did not 
mention earlier that the density 
of this alloy is about 4 grams per 
cubic centimeter, just about half 
that of your present sheathing. 
The weight saving per ship is 
about 294 tons. The old sheath- 
ing weighed 353 tons while the 
new weighs only 59 tons. So you 
can take back to Earth 59 tons 
of the alloy as the sheathing. We 
ought to be able to find places 
aboard the ship to store the other 
294 tons, plus the eleven tons 
payload you had in the first 



| place. It all comes down to the 
fact that you can carry 364 tons 
I of the alloy back with you; that’s 
over 30 times your original pay- 
load. Think that might be eco- 
nomical?” 

The captain had followed Bev- 
erage’s figures, and he replied by 
sticking out his hand and seizing 
Beverage’s; he shook the hand 
and nodded his head at the same 
time. He stepped back, threw his 
arms up in the air and said, 
“That’s it, man, that’s it. That’s 
the answer to all your problems. 
I’ll put a call in to Earth and 
have the other ships come on 
here for the treatment. Can you 
handle them?” 

“Yes,” said Beverage, “if every- 
body in the colony is willing to 

THE LONELY MAN 



r T , HERE was a great deal of 
loud noise from the assem- 
bled men and women in the 
dome. 

The captain said, “Why stop 
with the sheathing? Why can’t 
you treat the entire framework 
— right through the whole ship?” 

Beverage said, “We can, but 
the ship’s design ought to be 
changed; there’s no sense con- 
tinuing a design meant for heavy 
sheathing and unyielding frames. 
I’ve got a design for a new kind 
of space ship that is lighter, 
stronger, and faster than any we 
have now. I don’t see why we 
can’t build them here. There’s 
plenty of iron and nickel here, 
although it is deep underground. 
I think we can go into the busi- 
ness of building better space 
ships.” 

“Well,” said Sanchez. “That’s 
what we’ve been . Very good, 
Doc. Let’s plan on that.” 

Beverage nodded and began to 
form some words, but Sanchez 
turned to the captain and opened 
his mouth to speak. 

Ursula said, “Just a minute. 
Nathaniel hasn’t finished speak- 
ing yet.” 

Sanchez turned back with a 
guilty look, and said, “Oh, I’m 
sorry Doc. Shoot.” 

“It is possible,” said Beverage, 
“that they will be able to dupli- 



114 



GALAXY

cate this process on Earth in a 
few years. If that happens we 
will find ourselves in the same 
posture we were in this morning. 
So I have some suggestions to 
make for our future activities.” 
He stopped to clear his throat, 
and there were no interruptions. 
He noted that Ursula was listen- 
ing intently, and he felt very 
much at ease. “I’ve been able to 
make a heterocyclic compound of 
carbon and indium. The free val- 
ences of the indium atom enter 
readily into polymerization reac- 
tions. The resulting plastics and 
elastomers can be used to make 
vehicular tires that won’t wear 
out in a lifetime — the old life- 
time, that is. They also make the 
be$t potting materials for transis- 
tors I’ve ever seen — high heat 
dissipation and excellent mechan- 
ical ruggedness. The high molec- 
ular weight polymers are rigid 
and very light, and might even 
make better space-ship sheathing 
than the new alloy; we’d have to 
look into that. The reactions are 
carried out in liquid ozone, so 
Earth might have trouble dupli- 
cating them. Another thing. It 
turns out that helium subjected 
to hot liquid ozone under pres- 
sure becomes activated. I’ve been 
able to make a reaction product 
of helium and silicon dioxide. It 
looks just like glass but it’s 
stronger — quite a bit stronger, 
I might say. Also it absorbs a 



broad band of heat radiation and 
reemits it as electrical energy at 
the edges. I suspect that a sheet 
of the material is a single crys- 
tal, so it doubtless has some 
other interesting properties. It 
might make a good self-powered 
dome to live in on planets like 
this; there’s always thermal radi- 
ation around. If we make fibers 
out of it and weave it into cloth 
\ye might have a better kind of 
clothing, too.” He stopped and 
frowned at the table top. “There’s 
another thing. I’ve been able to 
introduce amine groups into cel- 
lulose molecules with one of the 
high-pressure ozone methods. I 
made a draw-down of the mate- 
rial and the resulting film seems 
to survive on living flesh. I dont 
know, though.” He pulled up the 
right sleeve of his coverall, held 
up his right arm, and critically 
inspected the forearm in the 
light, turning it this way and 
that. “I tried it on myself and it 
seems to be working out. It’s 
been on about two months now. 
It’s a little shiny and there’s no 
hair growing on it, but we may 
be able to take care of that. It 
might do for skin grafts.” 

H E DROPPED his arm and 
sat quietly, pursing his lips, 
wondering which project to men- 
tion next. The silence was thun- 
derous. Sanchez finally shook his 
head and looked appealingly at 



116 



GALAXY 



Ursula. She took no notice, since 
she, like everyone else, was star- 
ing open-mouthed at Beverage. 
Sanchez shook his head again 
and said, “Well, yes, Doc. That 
is . That ought to tide us 
over for awhile.” 

Beverage looked up as if about 
to speak, but he did not. 

“Well,” said the captain. “We’ve 
got a lot of work to do. I guess 
we better get at it. I’ll get my 
crew ready.” He left. 

Beverage stood up and said, 
“Yes, I have a lot to do, too.” He 
turned to Ursula. “Would you 
come out with me, Ursula? I 
would like to talk to you.” 

She nodded and got up and 
followed him to the door; the 
others all stepped back to let 
them pass. Beverage stepped 
through the inner door, held it 
momentarily for Ursula, and then 
stepped into the outer chamber 
ahead of her. He raised his mask 
to put it on, but a strap caught 
under his nose. He pushed the 
mask straight out in front of his 
face, and there reflected in the 
facepiece he saw a tableau tak- 
ing place behind him. 

Ursula had paused in the inner 
doorway, air streaming around 
b er - Her left hand was raised to- 
ward the group in the dome, and 
the point of her forefinger met 
the point of her thumb, forming 
a circle. The other three fingers 
of her hand stuck straight up, 



and her wrist was bent back. In 
the brief flash in which he saw 
the scene Beverage saw every 
person in the dome respond by 
making the same sign to Ursula, 
some of them wagging their 
hands. Then she stepped through 
the door and let it slam. Bever- 
age briefly wondered what it was 
all about, but immediately forgot 
it in the press of thinking of what 
he wanted to say to Ursula. 

, Outside, he said to her, “Suly, 
I’d like to ask you something. 
But I’d like to ask you from the 
crest of the hill. Will you go up 
there with me?” 

“Yes, Nathaniel. Yes.” And she 
slipped an arm through his and 
hugged it. Quietly they walked 
toward the crest of the hill to- 
gether. 

‘Nathaniel,” she said as they 
approached the top. “Were you 
going to say something else back 
in there?” 

Yes, I was, Suly. But it can 
wait. The fourth planet of this 
system — you know, Sulphos — 
has an atmosphere of almost 
pure carbon disulphide. We might 
be able to do some interesting 
things there. I was going to ask 
if some of our people here would 
go there with me sometime, but 
I was afraid they’d say no. Do 
you think they would?” 

Yes, she said, “I think they 
would.”

By MAGNUS LUDENS 



Everyone knows the Moon is dead. 
Everyone is quite correct — now! 



O N IMPACT he’d had time to 
see Hatter’s head jerk loose 
from the carefully weakened 
strap. As Hatter slumped uncon- 
scious he touched the hidden 
switch. 

A shock, then darkness. 

What first came to him out of 
the humming blackout mist was 
his own name : Marcusson. A1 
Marcusson, just turned sixteen 
that Saturday in June, that 
green-leafed day his father had 
called him out to the back yard. 
They had sat on discount-house 
furniture under the heavy maple, 
A1 who wore jeans and sneakers 
and a resigned expression, his 
father who wore glasses, a sport 
shirt, slacks, eyelet shoes and a 



curious reckless smile, a smile 
that didn’t belong in the picture. 

“Now you’re sixteen, Al, there’s 
something I have to tell you,” his 
father had begun. “My father 
told me when I turned sixteen, 
and his father told him. First, the 
name of our family isn’t Marcus- 
son. It’s Marcopoulos. Your 
name’s Alexander Marcopoulos.” 
“What? Dad, you must be kid- 
ding! Look, all the records . .” 
“The records don’t go back far 
enough. Our name was changed 
four generations back, but the le- 
gal records disappeared in the 
usual convenient courthouse fire. 
As far as anyone knows, our fam- 
ily’s name’s always been Marcus- 
son. My grandfather went to 



118 



GALAXY 



Minnesota and settled among 
the Swedes there. Unlike most 
foreigners he’d taken pains to 
learn good English beforehand. 
And Swedish. He was good at 
languages.” For a moment the 
out-of-place smile came back. 
“All our family is. Languages, 
math, getting along with people, 
seldom getting lost or confused. 
You better pay attention, Al. 
This is the only time I’m going 
to speak of our family, like my 
father. We never bothered much, 
by the way, about how our name 
was written. You can believe me 
or think I sat in the sun too long, 
but I’ll tell you how our most 
famous relatives spelled it: Mar- 
co Polo.” 

“Oh, now . .” 

“Never mind what you think 
now. Besides, I won’t answer any 
questions, anyway. My father 
didn’t and he was right. I found 
out some things by myself later; 
you’ll probably find out more. 
For example, the best job for us 
is still exploring. That’s why I 
became an oil geologist, and it 
paid off. Another thing: learning 
the legends of the place you’re 
in, if you take up exploring, can 
mean the difference between suc- 
cess and a broken neck. That’s 
I a H, boy. Guess I’ll get your 
mother some peonies for the sup- 
per table.” 

Al Marcusson had gone up 
quietly to his room. Later, his 



special gift for languages and 
math got him through college 
and engineering school; his sense 
of direction and lack of inner-ear 
trouble helped to get him chosen 
for Astronaut training while he 
was in the Air Force. 

While in training at the Cape 
he had met and married a lus- 
cious brunette librarian in one of 
the sponge-fishing towns, a bru- 
nette with a rather complicated 
last name that became forgotten 
as she turned into Mrs. Marcus- 
son, and unbeatable recipes for 
the most bewitching cocktails 
since Circe held the shaker for 
Ulysses. 

Marcusson’s hobbies included 
scuba diving, electronic tinkering 
and reading. His psychiatrists 
noted a tendency to reserve, even 
secrecy, which was not entirely 
bad in a man who worked with 
classified material and had to 
face long periods of time alone. 
Besides, his ability to get along 
with people largely compensated. 

VL^ITH slowly returning con- 
sciousness the last months 
of training swam in Al Marcus- 
son’s mind. The orbital flight — 
the only part of it he’d really 
enjoyed was the quarter-hour 
alone with SARAH, the electron- 
ic beacon, cut off from Control 
and even from the rescue team 
just over the horizon, alone with 
the music of wind and sea. 



MY LADY SELENE

For the moon shot he’d been 
responsible for communications, 
recording and sensing systems in- 
side the capsule, as Hatter had 
for the life-support systems and 
their two back-up men for pro- 
pulsion and ground systems co- 
ordination respectively. He re- 
lived the maddening, risky busi- 
ness of the master switch to be 
secretly connected with the cap- 
sule’s several brains and camou- 
flaged. The strap to be weakened. 
Then the blind terror of launch 
when his pulse had topped 120; 
blurred vision, clenched teeth, 
the suit digging into him, the 
brief relief of weightlessness e- 
rased by the cramped, terrifying 
ride filled with new sensations 
and endless petty tasks. The 
camera eye pitilessly trained on 
his helmet. The way things had 
of staying there when you’d put 
them away. On Earth — already 
it was “On Earth,” as if Earth 
was a port he’d sailed from — 
you put things out of your mind, 
but here they bobbed before you 
still, like the good luck charm in 
its little leather bag, for instance, 
the charm his wife had tied to 
one of his fastener tabs and that 
kept dancing in the air like a 
puppet, jerking every time he 
breathed. 

Every time he breathed in the 
familiar sweat-plastic-chemicals 
smell, familiar because he’d been 
smelling it in training, in the 



transfer truck, in the capsule 
mock-up for months. ' All that 
should be new and adventurous 
had become stale and automatic 
through relentless training. His 
eyes rested on the color-coded 
meters and switches that were as- 
sociated with nausea in the cen- 
trifuge tumbler-trainer. The couch 
made him think of long hours in 
the chlorinated pool — he al- 
ways used to come out with his 
stomach rumbling and wrinkled 
white fingers, despite the tablets 
and the silicone creams. His skin 
itched beneath the adhesive pads 
that held the prying electrodes 
to his body, itched like the salt 
and sand itch he felt after swim- 
ming between training bouts. It 
was still Florida air he breathed, 
but filters had taken out its oil- 
fouled hot smell, its whiffs of 
canteen cooking, fish, seaweed 
and raw concrete in the sun. Hat- 
ter’s and his own sing-song bit 
talk, so deliciously new to televi- 
sion audiences, rang trite in his 
own ears: a makeshift vocabu- 
lary, primer sentences chosen for 
maximum transmission efficiency 
to Control. 

The Control center he remem- 
bered from having watched orbi- 
tal flights himself. Machines that 
patiently followed pulse rate, 
breathing, temperature. Squiggly 
lines, awkward computer hand- 
writing, screens where dots 
jumped, screens that showed in- 



120 



GALAXY 



strument panels, screens where 
his own helmet showed, and in- 
side it the squirming blob that 
was his own face, rendered as a 
kind of rubberized black-and- 
white tragic mask. He felt the 
metal ears turning, questing for 
signals, the little black boxes, 
miniaturized colossi tracking, lis- 
tening, spewing tape. On the cap- 
sule itself — all folded in like 
Japanese water flowers — sen- 
sors, cameras, listeners, analyzers 
should have burgeoned on im- 
pact, shot up, reached out, 
grasped, retracted, analyzed, 
counted, transmitted. 

But he’d cut the switch. 

A L MARCUSSON blinked a- 
*"*• wake. 

He set about freeing himself, 
a task comparable to getting a 
butterfly alive out of a spider 
web. Every creak of his suit and 
of the moulded couch sound loud 
and flat in the newly silent cap- 
sule. His breathing soughed a- 
bout him. But no signal went out 
from the electrodes taped to his 
chest to say that his heart beat 
had again topped a hundred, that 
he sweated, that his stomach con- 
tracted — even though he was 
under no gravity strain, the emer- 
gency cooling worked, and his 
latest no-crumbs, low-residue 
meal had been welcomed by the 
same stomach an hour earlier. 

He sat up. The port gave off 



a pale creamy glow. He leaneo 
forward and could see nothing 
except for a cream- or eggshell- 
colored mist, even and opaque. 

He undid his glove-rings and 
took off his gloves. By the gleam 
of his wrist-light he checked 
whether Hatter was breathing 
correctly from his suit, visor 
down, and not the capsule’s air, 
then put his gloves on again and 
bled the air slowly out. They 
were not supposed to leave the 
capsule, of course. Still the pos- 
sibility of having to check or re- 
pair something had had to be 
considered and it was theoreti- 
cally possible. He began the 
nerve-rasping egress procedure, 
through the narrow igloo-lock 
that seemed to extend painful 
claws and knobs to catch at 
every loop and fold of his suit. 
At last he gave a frantic wiggle 
and rolled free. 

Because of the dead switch, 
turning antennae circled in vain, 
pens stopped reeling out ink, 
screens stayed blank. The men 
in the control room activated 
emergency signals but got no 
triggered responses. Meanwhile, 
television reporters sent frantic 
requests for background material 
fillers, their “and now back to’s” 
falling thick and fast. 

A1 Marcusson bounced on a 
kind of lumpy featherbed two or 
three times before coming to rest 
in the same eggshell soup. Dust. 



MY LADY SELENE 



121 



Moon dust that had no particu- 
lar reason for dropping back now 
cocooned the ship. He stood up 
with great care and staggered 
straight out, putting his feet 
down slowly to minimize dust 
puffs. The mist thinned and he 
rubbed the gloves against his 
visor and goggled. 

Cliffs, craters, spines, crests 
and jags stood there as in the 
photographs except for a curious 
staginess he realized came from 
the harsh footlights effect of the 
twilight zone they’d landed in 
and from the shorter horizon 
with its backdrop of old black 
velvet dusty with stars. But the 
colors! 

Ruby cliffs, surfaces meteor- 
pitted in places to a rosy bloom, 
rose to pinnacles of dull jade that 
fell again in raw emerald slopes; 
saffron splashes of small craters 
punctuated the violet sponge of 
scattered lava, topaz stalagmites 
reared against sapphire crests, 
amethyst spines pierced agate 
ridges . and on every ledge, 
in every hollow, pale moondust 
lay like a blessing. 

When you were a kid, did you 
ever wake up at night in a Pull- 
man berth and hear the snoring 
and looked at the moonwashed 
countryside knowing you only 
were awake and hugging the 
knowledge to yourself? Did you 
ever set off alone at dawn to fish 
or hunt and watch the slow 



awakening of trees? Did you 
ever climb the wall into an aban- 
doned estate and explore the 
park and suddenly come upon a 
statue half-hidden in honey- 
suckle, a statue with a secret 
smile? 

A1 Marcusson sat by himself 
on the twilight zone of the Moon 
and watched the sun shining 
through cloudy glass arches and 
throwing on moondust the same 
colored shadows that it throws 
through the great stained-glass 
windows on the flagstones of 
Chartres cathedral. He looked up 
at Earth, now in “New Earth” 
position, a majestic ring of blue 
fire flushed with violet, red and 
gold at the crescent where clouds 
flashed white iridescence. He 
jerked free the little bag that 
held his good luck charm and 
waited. 

They came. 

H E COULD see them silhou- 
etted against Earth, the long 
undulating V of them. Now he 
could discern their wings beating 
in the vacuum that couldn’t sup- 
port them and heard the wild 
lonely honking through the vac- 
uum that couldn’t transmit sound. 
White wings surged steadily 
nearer. Soon there was a temp- 
est of white, a tempest that 
stirred no dust, and the swans 
settled about him. 

A1 Marcusson stood up.

“My Lady Selene,” he began, 
speaking carefully although he 
knew that the sound could not 
be heard outside his helmet. “My 
Lady Luna, my Lady of the 
Swans, I greet you. I know of 
you through legends: I know you 
are Aphrodite the Swan-Rider, 
goddess of love that drives to 
suicide. I know you are the 
White Goddess, the Three- 
Women-in-One, who changes 
your slaves into swans. I know 
of your twin daughters, Helen 
the fair, bane of Troy, and dark 
Clytemnestra, Mycenae’s de- 
stroyer. I know of your flight as 
the Wyrd of death who took 
great Beowulf of the Geats, of 
your quests as Diana of the cruel 
moonlit hunts; I remember your 
swan-wings shadowing the hosts 
of Prince Igor on the steppes, I 
have seen the rings of your sa- 
cred Hansa swans decorating the 
moon-shaped steps of temples in 
Ceylon, your flights of swans and 
geese on painted tombs beyond 
the Nile. The witches of my own 
Thessaly called upon you to 
work their spells. On the feast of 
Beltane, on the first of May, with 
hawthorn branches blooming 
white as your swans, the Celts 
did you honor. The folk on the 
Rhine brought you figurines of 
white clay and long remembered 
your wild Walpurgisnacht. But 
as other beliefs drove out the 
old, you went from the minds of 



men to those of children. Only in 
Andersen’s tales do you still 
change your slaves into swans, 
only children understand the 
spells held in the foolish rhymes 
of Mother Goose. Children know 
of the lady who flies on goose’s 
back, her cape dark behind her, 
and each generation in turn still 
listens to your spells, my Lady of 
the Swans. And sometimes poets, 
and sometimes hunters, and 
sometimes lovers look up at the 
moon and are afraid and ac- 
knowledge your power.” 

A1 Marcusson stopped. The 
birds ringed him in. He held up 
his good luck charm, a small, 
carved rock-crystal swan, such as 
are found in the very ancient 
tombs of the bronze-age sea kings 
of the Aegean. 

“My Lady Selene,” he cried, “I 
bring an offering! I came alone, 
before the others, to tell you the 
new beliefs now come to your 
dwelling. I came to warn you, my 
Lady of the Swans, to beg you 
not to be wrathful against us, 
unwilling intruders, to ask you to 
take up your dwelling in another 
place, but not to deprive us of 
poetry, of witching spells and 
dreams, and all that the Moon 
has meant to us.” He threw the 
crystal swan before him. 

The plumes about him foamed 
and a snowy form emerged, a 
moonstone with black opal eyes 
who smiled and began to sing. 



MY LADY SELENE

Marcusson’s knees gave and his 
eyes closed. Then she spread 
great swan wings and soared, cir- 
cling far lest her shadow fall on 
the crumpled spacesuited figure. 
She rose. And her swans — her 
thousand myriad swans — rose 
after her out of cracks, caves and 
craters, from beneath overhangs, 
from 'ledges, hollows and rock- 
falls, their plumes at first stained 
with the colors of the stone. They 
winged away, V after sinuous V, 
across Earth and into space. 
When the last swan had left the 
Moon became just another piece 
of colored rock. 

A L MARCUSSON opened his 
eyes and made his way dul- 
ly back into the dust cloud now 
shot with flashes of red-orange as 
Earth’s laser beams searched for 
the capsule’s nerve centers. He 
bumped against a strut and forced 
his way in. 

A hum filled the capsule. Un- 
gainly jointed limbs, paddles, 
calyxes, sprouted from its outside 
walls. On Earth pens jiggled, 
tapes were punched, rows of fig- 
ures in five columns appeared on 
blank pages, pulses jumped and 
two groggy, worn-out faces ap- 
peared on the control room 
screens. Hatter’s eyes flickered 
over the boards and he opened 
his mouth. Some time later his 
disembodied voice came out of 
the monitor, reading dials, re- 



porting on systems. Then the 
screens showed A1 Marcusson’s 
eyes opening in turn. Control 
could see him leaning forward 
towards the port, his face drawn 
in haggard lines and shadows, 
then letting his head fall back. 
“Hey,” he said, “didn’t Doc tell 
you guys dust gives me hay 
fever?” 

On Earth the men about the 
screens slapped each other’s 
backs and grinned and wiped 
their eyes. Good old bellyaching 
Marcusson! Good old Al! The 
Moon was just another piece of 
rock, after all. 

But a star went nova in Cyg- 
nus, and lovers wished on it that 
night. — MAGNUS LUDENS

TOO MUCH IMAGINATION 

HTO the best of my knowledge 
the flying saucer myth never 
passed through the iron curtain, 
except for being ridiculed in the 
official Russian press. But that 
does not mean that the Russians 
are not addicted to the hunting of 
spurious mysteries too. Contrary 
to a fairly widespread belief, 
Soviet censorship does not inter- 
fere in such matters as long as 
the mysteries, real or imagined, 
have nothing to do with political 
dogma. Authors can even quote 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



125 



the Bible, provided it is treated 
as a historical work without reli- 
gious significance. 

For example the Literaturnaya 
Gazyeta (“Literary Gazette”), 
which once upon a time ran arti- 
cles bitterly denouncing science 
fiction, printed an article in which 
the destruction of Sodom was 
“tentatively explained” as the re- 
sult of a nuclear explosion, and 
the damage done Lot’s wife was 
blindness from having watched 
the explosion at close range! The 
same article explained the so- 
called Baalbek Verandah in Leb- 
anon — a large area paved with 
big stone slabs — as an ancient 
spaceport, used by cosmonauts 
from another planet. 

But the favorite exercise 
ground for untrammeled Russian 
imaginations is a place in the 
Soviet Union itself, an area in 
Central Siberia where a natural 
catastrophe took place in 1908. 
In astronomical literature this 
catastrophe goes under the name 
of the “Great Siberian Meteor of 
1908”, or the Podkamennaya 
Tunguska Meteorite. 

T^HE facts of the case can be 
quickly told: A few minutes 
after 7 AM on June 30, 1908, 
observers in Central Siberia saw 
a fiery body come up over the 
southern horizon. It looked more 
blinding than the sun which was 
in the sky at the same time, and 



moved rapidly almost due North. 
Shortly thereafter a “pillar of 
fire” could be seen shooting up- 
ward. An enormous black cloud 
followed. A number of explosions 
were heard in quick succession, 
and at least one witness felt a 
shock wave in the ground which 
he described as being “like a 
single wave in the sea.” Baro- 
graphs as far west as London reg- 
istered a shock wave in the at- 
mosphere but seismographs out- 
side of Russia did not register 
any ground shock. 

On the following day meteorol- 
ogists in Asia and Europe noticed 
“noctilucent clouds”, silvery-look- 
ing clouds at extreme altitudes. 
All of them were immediately re- 
minded of the noctilucent clouds 
that had hovered in the upper 
atmosphere for several years after 
the explosion of the volcano Ra- 
kata on Krakatoa in 1883. But 
when Krakatoa blew up, shock 
waves in the air had circled the 
globe several times, a wave in the 
ocean had been detected on the 
coast of California and all seismo- 
graphs had quivered. 

Here only a comparatively 
small aerial shockwave had pre- 
ceded the noctilucent clouds. It 
could not have been a major vol- 
canic catastrophe. At least one 
German meteorologist concluded 
that the “disturbance in the at- 
mosphere”, as he called it, had 
probably been caused by a large

meteorite. In Russia scientists 
seem to have concluded that 
there had been an earthquake in 
Central Siberia. Probably they 
were happy that it had struck in 
a virtually uninhabited area. Ten- 
tatively it was concluded that the 
earthquake had been near the 
small city of Kansk. There was 
no official action. 

It was not until 1920 that a 
Russian scientist, professor L. A. 
Kulik, having convinced himself 
that the “earthquake” must have 
been a meteorite impact, tried to 
find the place where it had struck. 

His tiny and severely under- 
financed expedition accomplished 
only two things. He proved that 
the meteorite had not landed 
near Kansk, and he collected a 
number of eyewitness reports 
from people old enough to re- 
member the event. In the mean- 
time an astronomer of the Irkutsk 
Observatory, A. V. Voznesensky, 
had concluded, from eyewitness 
stories and the few records there 
were, that the impact must have 
taken place near the sources of 
the Podkamennaya Tunguska 
river. The name means “stony 
Tunguska”. It is the middle river 
of three more or less parallel 
rivers, all named Tunguska, 
which flow westward into the 
Yenisei. 

Kulik’s next expedition, in 
1927, did reach the impact area. 
He found a large circle of trees 



blown down, their trunks all 
pointing toward a central spot. 
Between the center and the fallen 
trees Kulik found a dead forest 
the trunks standing but all the 
tops broken off. Farther away 
trees were found showing traces 
of burns on the side of their 
trunks facing the center. Kulik 
also noticed that in every case 
where a tree top had been broken 
off, or branches had been broken 
off, the place of breakage showed 
burns. 

But Kulik could not find the 
large crater that could be ex- 
pected in the center. There were 
a number of not very deep holes, 
all filled with water. And that 
was all. 

Since there was no main crater, 
Kulik concluded that the meteo- 
rite which had struck there was 
not a solid body but a “cloud” of 
meteoric fragments. Naturally he 
looked for such fragments but 
could not find any. He concluded 
that they had all disappeared 
from sight in the marshy ground. 

But subsequent expeditions re- 
turned with the same negative re- 
sults. Gradually the Podkamen- 
naya Tunguska meteorite be- 
came a mystery. Here you had an 
area which bore all the signs of a 
major impact, you had eyewit- 
ness stories corroborating this evi- 
dence. And you could not find a 
single trace of the meteorite it- 
self! 



Since there was absolutely no 
(way of getting around the evi- 
dence only one conclusion was 
possible: the meteorite must have 
been of a kind which completely 
disappeared afterwards. 

Leonid Kulik, who personally 
believed that it had been an iron 
meteorite, made more expedi- 
tions into the roadless and 
swampy area, without great suc- 
I cess. Still no main crater — it is 
now definite that there is none — 

! and still no fragments of the me- 
teorite. Only a story by one of the 
natives of the area, the Tunguses, 
that another native had told him 
i that a third one had shown him a 
piece of metal which looked like 
silver. By 1938 the first aerial 
photographs were taken, but 
either the equipment was wrong 
! for the purpose or the photogra- 
pher had no experience in taking 
pictures from the air. The pic- 
tures were so poor that they 
j could be called worthless. Then 
came the second world war and 
investigation stopped. Moreover 
Kulik, who in spite of his age (he 
was then 38) had volunteered for 
military duty, was wounded and 
taken prisoner by the Germans. 
He died in the prison camp. 

DY the time Kulik made his 
I - *-* last expedition, 1938-39, at 
| least one new theory about the 
disappearing meteorite had been 
formed and was discussed for a 



while. If the meteorite had been 
contraterrene matter everything 
could be explained. (As Galaxy 
readers know, contraterrene mat- 
ter is identical with ours except 
that the charges are reversed — 
the electron being positive, the 
proton negative, etc.) Contrater- 
rene matter would react violently 
with normal matter, liberating 
enormous amounts of energy by 
a mutual particle-for-particle an- 
nihilation. Since this reaction 
would, of course, start in the at- 
mosphere the unusual brightness 
of the body would be accounted 
for. The mutual annihilation of 
matter would release enough 
energy to account for the ob- 
served devastation. And, of 
course, the meteorite would dis- 
appear down to its last atom, 
taking an equal mass of earth 
matter along. The site of the im- 
pact would be strongly radio- 
active afterwards — but the im- 
pact had taken place in 1908 and 
the first investigation was not un- 
til 1927. And Kulik’s party had 
not carried any Geiger counters, 
so that they could not check on 
traces of radioactivity that might 
still have been there. 

By 1947 another expedition to 
the Podkamennaya Tunguska 
was delayed by a most curious 
coincidence. In eastern Siberia, a 
few hundred miles north of Vlad- 
ivostok, a large meteorite was 
seen to fall and all the scientific 



128

talent was rushed to the Sikhote- 
Alin mountains. It was a large 
iron meteorite, all right. It had 
broken up during the passage 
through the atmosphere and pro- 
duced over 120 craters of all 
sizes, the largest about 90 feet 
across. But there was no mystery 
about the Sikhote-Alin meteorite, 
through it delayed another expe- 
dition to the Tunguska. 

At that point a Russian engi- 
neer and science writer by the 
name of Aleksandr Kazantsev 
had entered the debate. His the- 
sis was that the meteorite of 1908 
had not been a meteorite at all, 
but a spaceship. 

Kazantsev did not hesitate to 
elaborate. It had been a huge 
atomic-powered interstellar ship 
which had approached our solar 
system, first investigating the out- 
er planets and finally approach- 
ing Earth, which clearly proved 
to be inhabited. The captain of 
the ship, circling the earth several 
times, decided to find an unin- 
habited area to land so as not to 
harm the inhabitants of Earth in- 
advertently. But as he entered 
the atmosphere for a landing in 
Siberia something went wrong. 
Possibly the aliens had misjudged 
the density of the earth’s atmos- 
phere. The ship heated up and 
became uncontrollable, and on 
touching the ground, or just a- 
bove it, the atomic engine ex- 
ploded, vaporizing the ship, flat- 



tening out the forest below and 
setting the taiga on fire. 

An atomic explosion of that 
type, Kazantsev maintained, 
would explain not only the ob- 
served phenomena but also the 
absence of any meteoritic mate- 
rial. Russian astronomers were 
presumably still shaking their 
heads when Kazantsev received 
the support of another science 
writer by the name of Boris 
Liapunov. 

Between them they seem to 
have succeeded in convincing a 
fair percentage of the Russian 
reading public that an interstellar 
expedition crashed in Siberia in 
1908. 

By 1957 a careful analysis of 
soil samples from the site, col- 
lected by Kulik, was carried out. 
Small globules of meteoric iron 
were discovered and found to con- 
tain 7 per cent of nickel, 0.7 per 
cent of cobalt and traces of ger- 
manium and copper. This is a 
rather typical composition of iron 
meteorites — and it should be 
stated right here that this mete- 
oric iron may well have no con- 
nection with the fall of 1908 at 
all. Such tiny bits of meteoric 
iron can be found anywhere on 
Earth if you search long enough; 
the daily infall of meteoric mat- 
ter is now estimated to be around 
1000 tons per day. The globules 
found may thus have fallen at 
any time in history. 

GALAXY 



T>UT Kazantsev, in a manner 
reminiscent of our flying 
saucer “researchers,” pounced on 
the composition. Iron plus nickel 
plus cobalt? Obviously a piece of 
the alloy which formed the tough 
outer skin of the spaceship. 
Traces of copper? Surely they 
must have had electrical equip- 
ment on board, requiring copper 
wires. He could have said the 
same if the traces had been traces 
of silver. And germanium? Why 
not? Electronic gear requires 
semi-conductors which can be 
germanium compounds. The ex- 
plosion, according to Kazantsev, 
took place before the ship 
touched the ground, therefore the 
trees directly below were merely 
stripped of their crowns (and ig- 
nited) while the trees farther a- 
way, struck by the blast at an 
angle, were knocked down. The 
“pillar of fire” topped by a large 
cloud could only have been an 
atomic explosion, Kazantsev de- 
clared. (This happens not to be 
the case. You can get very simi- 
lar clouds from any large explo- 
sion.) And the silvery clouds no- 
ticed by the meteorologists were 
the explosion debris, luminous be- 
cause atomic disintegration was 
still going on. (Yet the clouds 
caused by the Krakatoa catastro- 
phe looked the same and Kraka- 
toa’s blow-up holds no atomic 
mystery.) To finish up his case, 
Kazantsev dragged in an alleged 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



native legend, namely that the 
god Ogda burned Tunguses with 
“invisible fire.” Obviously, he 
wrote, some natives approached 
the blast site so soon after the 
event that local atomic fallout 
burned and killed them. 

One more supporter of the 
spaceship theory who turned up 
in 1958 was the airplane designer 
A. Y. Manotskov. 

Manotskov had checked on the 
eyewitness reports gathered main- 
ly by Kulik in 1921 and 1927 
and tried to calculate both the 
flightpath and the velocity of the 
body. Eyewitness reports, if they 
state the position of the observer 
and cite landmarks, can give a 
fairly accurate picture of the di- 
rection of a flightpath but are ab- 
solutely valueless when it comes 
to speed of travel. The speed of 
a low-flying slow body and of a 
high-flying fast body can look ex- 
actly the same — as anybody liv- 
ing near an airport can see for 
himself, when comparing the ap- 
parent speed of a small executive 
plane coming in for a landing and 
a jet passing overhead at 26,000 
feet. Manotskov arrived at the 
conclusion that the “meteorite” 
moved at the rate of only about 
1500 miles per hour. But if it was 
so slow, the observed devastation 
required a very large body, one 
well over one kilometer (0.6 
miles) in diameter. A meteorite 
that size must have left debris. 



130 



131 



Since none has been found it had 
to be a spaceship. 

At about that time Kazantsev 
made an interesting about-face. 

Having read about contrater- 
r.ene matter — he called it “anti- 
matter” — he said that one did 
not need to assume that the ship’s 
engine exploded. It was at least 
equally likely that the ship came 
from a planet consisting of anti- 
matter, and that its captain and 
crew never guessed that the mat- 
ter composing Earth was of the 
opposite kind. With that theory 
Kazantsev agreed with western 
ideas it could have been a contra- 
terrene meteorite. He substituted 
a contraterrene spaceship for a 
natural body. Apparently he did 
not notice that his acceptance of 
contraterrene matter contra- 
dicted his earlier conclusions 
drawn from the composition of 
the meteoritic globules found on 
the site. If his alien ship had ger- 
manium semi-conductors that 
would have been contraterrene 
germanium and nothing would 
have been left to analyze. 

T HE Soviet Academy of Sci- 
ences paid for another expe- 
dition in 1957, headed by pro- 
fessor Kirill P. Florensky, who 
saw to it that there were Geiger 
counters among the equipment. 
The radioactivity of the soil was 
found to be perfectly normal — 
which admittedly might well be 



the case after nearly half a cen- 
tury, especially since there were 
no figures about the radioactivity 
of that area before the catastro- 
phe. And Florensky’s expedition 
definitely established the absence 
of a major crater. Now every- 
thing was what it had been like 
thirty years earlier: all the evi- 
dence of a major impact, but no 
crater and rto meteoritic frag- 
ments. The only new item added 
was the proved absence of above- 
normal radioactivity. 

While Florensky was still in 
Siberia, the astronomer and space 
travel expert Ariy Shternfeld 
made a few devastating com- 
ments about the professional a- 
bility of Kazantsev’s spaceship 
captain. As our earth orbits the 
sun the area which has dawn is 
the “front side.” Since the impact 
took place at 7 o’clock in the 
morning, Siberia was still on the 
“front side” of the moving earth. 
Hence Earth and spaceship col- 
lided head-on. 

Any spaceship captain worth 
his four stripes (or just one and 
a half of them) would trail a 
moving planet on which he 
wished to make planetfall, which 
means that he would land be- 
tween, say, 9 and 10 P.M. of lo- 
cal time of the landing area. 

This simple fact had been over- 
looked by Kazantsev, by Liapu- 
nov, by Manotskov and by every- 
body else who had written and 



132 



GALAXY 



orated about the “spaceship crash 
of 1908.” 

Well, is there an answer at all? 

Remember that the main and 
at first glance somewhat disturb- 
ing result of all the facts is that 
the meteorite had to “disappear” 
completely. This requirement, in 
fact, was the main reason why a 
contra-terrene meteorite was pos- 
tulated by some. Anybody who 
wishes to believe this may safely 
do so. Nothing speaks against this 
possibility. But there are others. 

Supposing the meteorite had 
just been a hundred thousand 
tons of water and ice. It would 
have completely disappeared dur- 
ing the same summer and would 
have caused just as much devas- 
tation. But the pillar of fire and 
the burning of the taiga speaks 
against it. A sufficiently hard im- 
pact of a very large lump of ice 
would produce temperatures high 
enough to ignite wood; but it 
would also smother the fire at 
once. 

However, there is one type of 
cosmic body which would do ev- 
erything the Tunguska meteorite 
did and would not necessarily 
smother a fire set by its impact, 
but it would completely disap- 
pear just the same. This body is 
a comet. 

Some thirty years ago the as- 
tronomical concept of a comet 
was that it consisted of a loose 
accumulation of cosmic matter 



holding a large amount of gases 
— like ammonia, methane and 
ordinary water. Then Fred L. 
Whipple showed that things had 
to be the other way round. A 
loose cloud of meteoric matter 
could not hold enough gas. A 
comet had to consist in the main 
of frozen gases, probably holding 
some particles of cosmic dust im- 
bedded in it. 

The impact of a small comet 
would produce all the phenomena 
observed in Siberia. And it would 
completely disappear: the am- 
monia and methane would min- 
gle with the atmosphere (the 
methane probably burning up) 
while the water would also go 
into the atmosphere as more 
water vapor. 

The Russians have accepted 
this explanation — the Russian 
astronomers, that is, not Kazant- 
sev and company. The combus- 
tion of methane, of course, just 
produces carbon dioxide and wa- 
ter vapor (CHi -|- 20» = C0 2 _|_ 2H™0) 
which would be undistinguisha- 
ble; but the other frozen gases of 
which a comet is likely to con- 
sist might leave a chemical resi- 
due in the soil. 

Russian chemists are busy with 
soil samples from the Tunguska 
area again, this time looking for 
something else. If they succeed 
the theory of collision with a 
small comet would be perma- 
nently vindicated.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

I know that the names of the 
days of the week were orginally 
the names of planets. That is, 
each planet had its special day. 
But they seem to use different 
planets in English and in French. 
And I cannot figure out why the 
names appear in the order in 
which they do appear. Is there 
any system or is it just accident? 

Gertrude Hoffner 
Chicago, 111. 

The names of the planets were 
indeed used by the Romans, but 
the reference was more to the 
gods associated with the various 
planets. This accounts, as you’ll 
see, for some of the differences 
between English and French and 
other languages as well. First you 
you have to realize that the 
names were given in pre-Coperni- 
can days, so that the sun and the 
moon appear as “planets.” The 
(to us) strange sequence of the 
planets is the result of the ancient 
belief that the planets ruled one 
hour of each day in succession. 
The first hour of the first day in- 
dubitably was ruled by the outer- 
most planet, Saturn; the second 
hour was then ruled by the next 
planet closer to the earth, namely 
Jupiter; the third hour by Mars, 
etc., etc. 

Now, if Saturn rules the first 
hour of the day, it logically also

third hour of that day must then 
be ruled by Jupiter and the 
twenty-fourth hour by Mars. This 
means that the first hour of the 
next day is ruled by the sun. 

If you continue counting in this 
manner, you find that the first 
hour of each day (if we start with 
a day where the sun rules the 
first hour) is ruled by the planets 
in the following sequence: sun, 
moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, 
Venus, Saturn. The “ruler of the 
first hour” gave its name to the 
day. It happened to fit nicely that 
after one week the sun would 
again rule the first hour of the 
first day in the new week. (If it 
had not fitted, another system 
would probably have been 
evolved.) 

Now look at the table of 
names. The first column, the 
Latin, is perfectly clear. The day 
of the sun is followed by the day 
of the moon and so on through 
the sequence just cited. 

The second column, the Eng- 
lish names, may be called an 
Anglo-Saxon translation of the 
Latin column. Again the day of 
the sun is followed by the day of 
the moon, but Mars has been re- 
placed by the Germanic god of 
battles Tues. The next day is 
Woden’s day; Woden (or Wotan, 
or Odin) is the “wanderer,” like 
fast-moving Mercury. Jupiter’s 



day becomes Thor’s day, while 
beautiful Venus has been re- 
placed by the equally beautiful 
Germanic goddess Frigga (or 
Freya). But Saturday is still Sa- 
turn’s day, even in English. The 
third column, the German col- 
umn, is the German version of 
the English column, as can easily 
be seen. The main exception is 
Wednesday. The German name 
has no relation to mythology of 
any kind; Mittwoch just means 
“Middle of the Week.” For the 
following day Donar is substi- 
tuted for Thor. German has two 
names for Saturday; the North 
German form Sonnabend means 
Sunday Eve, analogous to Christ- 
mas Eve, while the South Ger- 
man form Samstag probably was 
influenced by the French. The 
French and Italian names follow, 
as you can see, the Latin very 
closely, except for Sunday which 
in both languages becomes the 
Lord’s Day. And in Italian the

Saturday is Sabbato. I may add 
here that until, say, 1910, the 
word Sabbath was used in Ger- 
man too with the meaning of 
Saturday, if the speaker came 
from a religious family or if the 
theme under discussion was re- 
ligious. 

Has there ever been a tribe of 
people, now or in the historical 
past, which had fur? I remember 
mention of “poodle men” in Rus- 
sia, but consider this a hoax. Fur- 
thermore, is it known whether 
any prehistoric humans, like the 
Neanderthalers, had fur? Since 
my father is a minister who does 
not approve of evolution please 
don’t print my name.

As for your father’s disapprov- 
al of evolution I can only repeat 
what I once said before: if you 
fall out of a window on the 38th 



134

floor it does not matter whether 
you “ believe” in the law of grav- 
ity. It — and evolution — do not 
depend on anybody’s approval. 

As for your question about a 
race of furred men the answer is 
no. No such race or tribe has ever 
turned up. The “Hairy Ainu” of 
Kamtchatka look as hairy as they 
are mainly because they never 
cut their head or body hair. (It 
may be worth mentioning that 
among the major racial groups 
the “whites” happen to be the 
hairiest.) 

However, there was a Russian 
by the name of Adrian Yeftikhev 
who did have a complete fur and 
was billed as the Poodle Man by 
a show manager. He lived around 
1900 and is said to have been 
just one of a family of hairy peo- 
ple. This indubitably was an in- 
dividual case. I even hesitate to 
use the term atavism, because we 
simply do not know whether our 
ancestors had a fur and if so what 
type of fur. At about the time 
Yeftikhev was shown around the 
larger cities of Europe, a prehis- 
toric picture was discovered in 
France. It showed a naked man, 
holding a stick (spear?) in one' 
hand. He was portrayed crawling, 
obviously hunting game, and all 
over his naked body there were 
short lines. At first glance it 
looked as if the prehistoric artist 
had intended to indicate hair, but 
a careful examination of these 



short lines showed that they did 
not follow the lie of a fur, hence 
they were accepted generally as 
mere fill-in lines. 

Of course our more remote 
proto-human ancestors probably 
had a fur of some kind, but we 
cannot be specific as to who and 
when. 

With all the talk of “putting a 
man on the moon” in 1970, or 
1968, or whatever, don’t people 
overlook the difficulty of landing 
a ship on its exhaust so that it 
comes to rest just at the moon’s 
surface? Please tell me what has 
been done about the problem. 

John D. Macmillan 

Merion, Penna. 

Well, no. Nobody “overlooks” 
any difficulties; the reason why 
you don’t read much about this 
at the present moment is prob- 
ably due to the fact that several 
systems have been designed and 
are now under study. The princi- 
ple is that a total velocity of 
about two miles per second has to 
be “killed”. This velocity would 
be compounded of the gravita- 
tional pull of the moon, the mo- 
tion of the moon plus any “sur- 
plus” velocity the ship itself might 
have. Now the problem is not to 
reduce a velocity of two miles per 
second to zero but reduce the 
velocity to zero at the moment 
the altitude above the lunar sur- 
face is zero. 



136 



GALAXY 



One suggestion that has been 
published runs as follows: the 
rocket will approach the moon 
tail first, of course. At a certain 
distance from the lunar surface, 
predetermined by calculation, the 
rocket motors will start working, 
reducing the velocity. The pre- 
calculation should be good 
enough to reduce the relative 
motions of the moon and the 
rocket to, say, 300 to 400 yards 
per second. By the time this is 
accomplished the distance of the 
rocket from the lunar surface 
will be on the order of one 
mile or so. Now a radar device 
takes over. Successive radar 
readings between ship and lunar 
surface will give both distance 
and relative velocity. Through a 
computing device these readings 
control the speed of the fuel 
pumps. If the rocket is still one 
mile above the lunar surface and 
the relative velocity is down to 
50 yards per second the pumps 



will be made to run quite slowly. 
They may even shut off com- 
pletely for, say, 20 seconds. On 
the other hand if the altitude is 
down to a hundred yards and the 
velocity is still around 300 yards 
per second, the pumps will work 
at full speed. 

This proposed system would 
become unreliable for the last 50 
yards or so, since it is quite 
possible that the exhaust blast 
will then begin to kick up lunar 
dust and thereby confuse the 
radar readings. Another problem 
is that this device, as described, 
does not take a possible lateral 
drift into account. 

But the problems are known 
and being thought about. More- 
over, the first manned landing 
will be preceded by a number of 
“softlanded” unmanned devices 
which will point out any in- 
adequacies which may exist in 
the first experimental systems.

To Kworn the object was a roadblock, 
threatening his life. But it was also 
a high road to a magnificent future!

Illustrated by FINLAY 



T HE UL Kworn paused in his 
search for food, extended 
his eye and considered the thing 
that blocked his path. 

He hadn’t notice the obstacle 
until he had almost touched it. 
His attention had been focused 
upon gleaning every feeder large 
enough to be edible from the 
lichens that covered his feeding 



strip. But the unexpected warmth 
radiating from the object -had 
startled him. Sundown was at 
hand. There should be nothing 
living or non-living that radiated 
a fraction of the heat that was 
coming from the gleaming metal 
wall which lay before him. He 
expanded his mantle to trap the 
warmth as he pushed his eye up- 



138

ward to look over the top. It 
wasn’t high, just high enough to 
be a nuisance. It curved away 
from him toward the boundaries 
of his strip, extending completely 
across the width of his land. 

A dim racial memory told him 
that this was an artefact, a prod- 
uct of the days when the Folk 
had leisure to dream and time 



to build. It had probably been 
built by his remote ancestors mil- 
lennia ago and had just recently 
been uncovered from its hiding 
place beneath the sand. These 
metal objects kept appearing and 
disappearing as the sands shifted 
to the force of the wind. He had 
seen them before, but never a 
piece so large or so well pre- 



ON THE FOURTH PLANET 



139 






served. It shone as though it had 
been made yesterday, gleaming 
with a soft silvery luster against 
the blue-black darkness of the 
sky. 

As his eye cleared the top of 
the wall, he quivered with shock 
and astonishment. For it was not 
a wall as he had thought. In- 
stead, it was the edge of a huge 
metal disc fifty raads in diameter. 
And that wasn’t all of it. Three 
thick columns of metal extended 
upward from the disc, leaning in- 
ward as they rose into the sky. 
High overhead, almost beyond 
the range of accurate vision, they 
converged to support an immense 
cylinder set vertically to the 
ground. The cylinder was almost 
as great in diameter as the disc 
upon whicji his eye first rested. It 
loomed overhead, and he had a 
queasy feeling that it was about 
to fall and crush him. Strange 
jointed excresences studded its 
surface, and in its side, some two- 
thirds of the way up, two smaller 
cylinders projected from the big- 
ger one. They were set a little 
distance apart, divided by a ver- 
tical row of four black designs, 
and pointed straight down his 
feeding strip. 

The U1 Kworn eyed the giant 
structure with disgust and puzzle- 
ment. The storm that had uncov- 
ered it must have been a great 
one to have blown so much sand 
away. It was just his fortune to 



have the thing squatting in his 
path! His mantle darkened with 
anger. Why was it that every- 
thing happened to him? Why 
couldn’t it have lain in someone 
else’s way, upon the land of one 
of his neighbors? It blocked him 
from nearly three thousand 
square raads of life-sustaining 
soil. To cross it would require 
energy he could not spare. Why 
couldn’t it have been on the Ul 
Caada’s or the Ul Varsi's strip — 
or any other of the numberless 
Folk? Why did he have to be 
faced with this roadblock? 

He couldn’t go around it since 
it extended beyond his territory 
and, therefore, he’d have to waste 
precious energy propelling his 
mass up the wall and across the 
smooth shining surface of the 
disc — all of which would have 
to be done without food, since his 
eye could see no lichen growing 
upon the shiny metal surface. 

r T'HE chill of evening had set- 
tied on the land. Most of the 
Folk were already wrapped in 
their mantles, conserving their 
energy until the dawn would 
warm them into life. But Kworn 
felt no need to estivate. It was 
warm enough beside the wall. 

The air shimmered as it 
cooled. Microcrystals of ice 
formed upon the legs of the struc- 
ture, outlining them in shimmer- 
ing contrast to the drab shadowy 



landscape, with its gray-green 
cover of lichens stippled with the 
purple balls of the lichen feeders 
I that clung to them. Beyond 
Kworn and his neighbors, spaced 
' twenty raads apart, the mantled 
\ bodies of the Folk stretched in a 
j long single line across the rolling 
! landscape, vanishing into the 
darkness. Behind this line, a day’s 
I travel to the rear, another line of 
the Folk was following. Behind 
I them was yet another. There 
were none ahead, for the Ul 
Kworn and the other Ul were 
the elders of the Folk and moved 
along in the first rank where their 
j maturity and ability to repro- 
duce had placed them according 
to the Law. 

Caada and Varsi stirred rest- 
lessly, stimulated to movement 
by the heat radiating from the 
obstacle, but compelled by the 
Law to hold their place in the 
1 ranks until the sun’s return 
would stimulate the others. Their 
dark crimson mantles rippled 
over the soil as they sent restless 
I pseudopods to the boundaries of 
I their strips. 

They were anxious in their at- 
tempt to communicate with the 
I Ul Kworn. 

But Kworn wasn’t ready to 
communicate. He held aloof as 
i he sent a thin pseudopod out to- 
J ward the gleaming wall in front 
j of him. He was squandering en- 
ergy; but he reasoned that he had 



better learn all he could about 
this thing before he attempted to 
cross it tomorrow, regardless of 
what it cost. 

It was obvious that he would 
have to cross it, for the Law was 
specific about encroachment up- 
on a neighbor’s territory. No 
member oi the Folk shall tres- 
pass the feeding land of another 
during the Time of Travel except 
with published permission. Tres- 
pass shall be punished by the 
ejection of the offender from his 
place in rank. 

And that was equivalent to a 
death sentence. 

He could ask Caada or Varsi 
for permission, but he was vir- 
tually certain that he wouldn’t 
get it. He wasn’t on particularly 
good terms with his neighbors. 
Caada was querulous, old and sel- 
fish. He had not reproduced this 
season and his vitality was low. 
He was forever hungry and not 
averse to slipping a sly pseudo- 
pod across the boundaries of his 
land to poach upon that of his 
neighbor. Kworn had warned 
him some time ago that he would 
not tolerate encroachment and 
would call for a group judgment 
if there was any poaching. And 
since the Folk were physically 
incapable of lying to one another, 
Caada would be banished. After 
that Caada kept his peace, but 
his dislike for Kworn was always 
evident.

T>UT Varsi who held the land 
on Kworn’s right was worse. 
He had advanced to U1 status 
only a year ago. At that time 
there had been rumors among 
the Folk about illicit feeding and 
stealing of germ plasm from the 
smaller and weaker members of 
the race. But that could not be 
proved, and many young Folk 
died in the grim process of grow- 
ing to maturity. Kworn shrugged. 
If Varsi was an example of the 
younger generation, society was 
heading hell-bent toward Empti- 
ness. He had no love for the 
pushing, aggressive youngster 
who crowded out to the very 
borders of his domain, pressing 
against his neighbors, alert and 
aggressive toward the slightest 
accidental spillover into his terri- 
tory. What was worse, Varsi had 
reproduced successfully this year 
and thus had rejuvenated. 
Kworn’s own attempt had been 
only partially successful. His en- 
ergy reserves hadn’t been great 
enough to produce a viable off- 
spring, and the rejuvenation 
process in his body had only 
gone to partial completion. It 
would be enough to get him to 
the winter feeding grounds. But 
as insurance he had taken a place 
beside Caada, who was certain to 
go into Emptiness if the feeding 
en route was bad. 

Still, he hadn’t figured that he 
would have Varsi beside him. 



He consoled himself with the 
thought that others might have 
as bad neighbors as he. But he 
would never make the ultimate 
mistake of exchanging germ 
plasm with either of his neigh- 
bors, not even if his fertility and 
his position depended upon it. 
Cells like theirs would do nothing 
to improve the sense of discipline 
and order he had so carefully de- 
veloped in his own. His offspring 
were courteous and honorable, a 
credit to the Folk and to the 
name of Kworn. A father should 
be proud of his offspring, so that 
when they developed to the point 
where they could have descend- 
ants, he would not be ashamed of 
what they would produce. An Ul, 
Kworn thought grimly, should 
have some sense of responsibility 
toward the all-important future 
of the race. 

His anger died as he exerted 
synergic control. Anger was a 
waster of energy, a luxury he 
couldn’t afford. He had little en- 
ough as it was. It had been a 
bad year. Spring was late, and 
winter had come early. The sum- 
mer had been dry and the lichens 
in the feeding grounds had grown 
poorly. The tiny, bulbous lichen 
feeders, the main source of food 
for the Folk, had failed to ripen 
to their usual succulent fullness. 
They had been poor, shrunken 
things, hardly worth ingesting. 
And those along the route to the 



142 



GALAXY 



winter feeding grounds were no 
better. 

Glumly he touched the wall 
before him with a tactile fila- 
ment. It was uncomfortably 
warm, smooth and slippery to 
the touch. He felt it delicately, 
noting the almost microscopic 
horizontal ridges on the wall’s 
surface. He palpated with relief. 
The thing was climbable. But 
even as he relaxed, he recoiled, 
the filament writhing in agony! 
The wall had burned his flesh! 
Faint threads of vapor rose from 
where he had touched the metal, 
freezing instantly in the chill air. 
He pinched off the filament in an 
automatic protective constriction 
of his cells. The pain ceased in- 
stantly, but the burning memory 
was so poignant that his mantle 
twitched and shuddered convul- 
sively for some time before the 
reflexes died. 

r F'HOU GHTFULL Y he ingest- 
ed his severed member. With 
a sense of numbing shock he real- 
ized that he would be unable to 
pass across the disc. The implica- 
tions chilled him. If he could not 
pass, his land beyond the road- 
block would be vacant and open 
to preemption by his neighbors. 
Nor could he wait until they had 
passed and rejoin them later. The 
Law was specific on that point. 
If one of the Folk lags behind in 
his rank, his land becomes vacant 

ON THE FOURTH PLAN ET 



and open to his neighbors. Nor 
can one who has lagged behind 
reclaim his land by moving for- 
ward. He who abandons his posi- 
tion, abandons it permanently. 

Wryly, he reflected that it was 
this very Law that had impelled 
him to take a position beside the 
Ul Caada. And, of course, his 
neighbors knew the Law as 
well as he. It was a part of them, 
a part of their cells even before 
they split off from their parent. 
It would be the acme of folly to 
expect that neighbors like Varsi 
or Caada would allow him to 
pass over their land and hold his 
place in rank. 

Bitterness flooded him with a 
stimulation so piercing that 
Caada extended a communica- 
tion filament to project a ques- 
tion. “What is this thing which 
lies upon your land and mine?” 
Caada asked. His projection was 
weak and feeble. It was obvious 
that he would not last for many 
more days unless feeding im- 
proved. 

“I do not know. It is something 
of metal, and it bars my land. I 
cannot cross it. It burns me when 
I touch it.” 

A quick twinge of excitement 
rushed along Caada’s filament. 
The old Ul broke the connection 
instantly, but not before Kworn 
read the flash of hope that 
Kworn had kindled. There was 
no help in this quarter, and the 



143 



wild greed of Varsi was so well 
known that there was no sense 
even trying that side. 

A surge of hopelessness swept 
through him. Unless he could find 
some way to pass this barrier he 
was doomed. 

He didn’t want to pass into 
Emptiness. He had seen too many 
others go that way to want to 
follow them. For a moment he 
thought desperately of begging 
Caada and Varsi for permission 
to cross into their land for the 
short time that would be neces- 
sary to pass the barrier, but rea- 
son asserted itself. Such an act 
was certain to draw a flat refusal 
and, after all, he was the U1 
Kworn and he had his pride. He 
would not beg when begging was 
useless. 

And there was a bare possi- 
bility that he might survive if he 
closed his mantle tightly about 
him and waited until all the 
ranks had passed. He could then 
bring up the rear . and, possi- 
bly, just possibly, there would be 
sufficient food left to enable him 
to reach the winter feeding 
grounds. 

And it might still be possible 
to cross the disc. There was 
enough warmth in it to keep him 
active. By working all night he 
might be able to build a path of 
sand across its surface and thus 
keep his tissues from being seared 
by the metal. He would be tech- 



nically violating the law by mov- 
ing ahead of the others, but if 
he did not feed ahead, no harm 
would be done. 

TTE MOVED closer to the bar- 
rier and began to pile sand 
against its base, sloping it to 
make a broad ramp to the top 
of the disc. The work_ was slow 
and the sand was slippery. The 
polished grains slipped away and 
the ramp crumbled time after 
time. But he worked on, piling up 
sand until it reached the top of 
the disc. He looked across the 
flat surface that stretched before 
him. 

Fifty raads! 

It might as well be fifty zets. 
He couldn’t do it. Already his 
energy level was so low that he 
could hardly move, and to build 
a raad-wide path across this ex- 
panse of metal was a task beyond 
his strength. He drooped across 
the ramp, utterly exhausted. It 
was no use. What he ought to do 
was open his mantle to Empti- 
ness. 

He hadn’t felt the communic- 
ation filaments of Caada and 
Varsi touch him. He had been 
too busy, but now with Caada’s 
burst of glee, and Varsi’s cynical, 
“A noble decision, U1 Kworn. 
You should be commended,” he 
realized that they knew every- 
thing. 

His body rippled hopelessly. 



144 



GALAXY 



He was tired, too tired for anger. 
His energy was low. He contem- 
i plated Emptiness impassively. 
I Sooner or later it came to all 
Folk. He had lived longer than 
f most, and perhaps it was his time 
to go. He was finished. He ac- 
cepted the fact with a cold fatal- 
ism that he never dreamed he 
possessed. Lying there on the 
, sand, his mantle spread wide, he 
waited for the end to come. 

It wouldn’t come quickly, he 
thought. He was still far from the 
cellular disorganization that pre- 
j ceeded extinction. He was mere- 
ly exhausted, and in need of food 
. to restore his energy. 

With food he might still have 
j an outside chance of building the 
path in time. But there was no 
1 food. He had gleaned his area 
l completely before he had ever 
! reached the roadblock. 

Lying limp and relaxed on the 
i ramp beside the barrier, he slow- 
ly became conscious that the me- 
1 tal wasn’t dead. It was alive! 
Rhythmic vibrations passed 
through it and were transmitted 
! to his body by the sand. 

A wild hope stirred within him. 
If the metal were alive it might 
* hear him if he tried to communi- 
j cate. He concentrated his re- 
maining reserves of energy, 
j steeled himself against the pain 
and pressed a communication fil- 
ament against the metal. 

“Help me!” he projected des- 



perately. “You’re blocking my 
strip! I can’t pass!” 

Off to one side he sensed Var- 
si’s laughter and on the other 
felt Caada’s gloating greed. 

“I cannot wake this metal,” he 
thought hopelessly as he tried 
again, harder than before, ignor- 
ing the pain of his burning flesh. 

Something clicked sharply 
within the metal, and the tempo 
of the sounds changed. 

“It’s waking!” Kworn thought 
wildly. 

r I ''HERE was a creaking noise 
from above. A rod moved out 
from the cylinder and twisted in- 
to the ground in Varsi’s territory, 
to the accompaniment of clicking, 
grinding noises. A square grid 
lifted from the top of the cylin- 
der and began rotating. And 
Kworn shivered and jerked to 
the tremendous power of the 
words that flowed through him. 
They were words, but they had 
no meaning, waves of sound that 
hammered at his receptors in an 
unknown tongue he could not un- 
derstand. The language of the 
Folk had changed since the days 
of the ancients, he thought de- 
spairingly. 

And then, with a mantle-shat- 
tering roar, the cylinders jutting 
overhead spouted flame and 
smoke. Two silvery balls trailing 
thin, dark filaments shot out of 
the great cylinder and buried 



ON THE FOURTH PLANET 



145 



themselves in the sand behind 
him. The filaments lay motion- 
less in the sand as Kworn, 
wrapped defensively in his man- 
tle, rolled off the ramp to the 
ground below. 

The silence that followed was 
so deep that it seemed like Emp- 
tiness had taken the entire land. 

Slowly Kworn loosened his 
mantle. “In the name of my first 
ancestor,” he murmured shakily, 
“what was that?” His senses were 
shocked and disorganized by the 
violence of the sound. It was 
worse even than the roar and 
scream of the samshin that oc- 
casionally blew from the south, 
carrying dust, lichens, feeders 
and even Folk who had been too 
slow or too foolish to hide from 
the fury of the wind. 

Gingerly, Kworn inspected the 
damage to his mantle. It was 
minor. A tiny rip that could 
easily be repaired, a few grains 
of sand that could be extruded. 
He drew himself together to per- 
form the repairs with the least 
possible loss of energy, and as he 
did, he was conscious of an ema- 
nation coming from the filaments 
that had been hurled from the 
cylinder. 

Food! 

And such food! 

It was the distilled quintes- 
sence of a thousand purple feed- 
ers! It came to his senses in a 
shimmering wave of ecstasy so 



great that his mantle glowed a 
bright crimson. He stretched a 
pseudopod toward its source, and 
as he touched the filament his 
whole body quivered with antici- 
pation. The barrier was blotted 
from his thoughts by an orgy of 
shuddering delight almost too 
great for flesh to endure. Waves 
of pleasure ran through his body 
as he swiftly extended to cover ] 
the filament. It could be a trap, 
he thought, but it made no dif- 
ference. The demands of his de- 
pleted body and the sheer vacu- 
ole-constricting delight of this in- 
credible foodstuff made a combi- 
nation too potent for his will to 
resist, even if it had desired to do 
so. Waves of pleasure rippled 
through him as more of his ab- 
sorptive surface contacted the 
filament. He snuggled against it, 
enfolding it completely, letting 
the peristaltic rushes sweep 
through him. He had never fed 
like this as long as he could re- 
call. His energy levels swelled 
and pulsed as he sucked the last 
delight from the cord, and con- 
templated the further pleasure 
waiting for him in that other one 
lying scarcely twenty raads away. 

Sensuously, he extended a 
pseudopod from his upper sur- 
face and probed for the other 
filament. He was filled to the top 
of his primary vacuole but the 
desire for more was stronger than 
ever — despite the fact that he 

GALAXY

knew the food in the other fila- 
ment would bring him to critical 
level, would force him to repro- 
duce. The thought amused him. 
As far back as he could remem- 
ber, no member of the Folk had 
ever budded an offspring during 
the Time of Travel. It would be 
unheard of, something that would 
go down through the years in 
the annals of the Folk, and per- 
haps even cause a change in the 
Law. 

The pseudopod probed, 
reached and stopped short of its 
goal. There was nothing around 
it but empty air. 

T7EAR drove the slow orgasmic 
thoughts from his mind. Ab- 
sorbed in gluttony, he hadn’t 
noticed that the filament had 
tightened and was slowly draw- 
ing back into the cylinder from 
whence it came. And now it was 
too late! He was already over the 
rim of the metal disc. 

Feverishly, he tried to disen- 
gage his absorptive surfaces 
from the filament and crawl 
down its length to safety, but he 
couldn’t move. He was stuck to 
the dark cord by some strange 
adhesive that cemented his cells 
firmly to the cord. He could not 
break free. 

The line moved steadily up- 
ward, dragging him inexorably 
toward a dark opening in the 
cylinder overhead. Panic filled 



him! Desperately he tried to 
loosen his trapped surfaces. His 
pseudopod lashed futilely in the 
air, searching with panic for 
something to grip, something to 
clutch that would stop this slow 
movement to the hell of pain 
that waited for him in the metal 
high overhead. 

His searching flesh struck an- 
other’s, and into his mind flooded 
the U1 Caada’s terrified thought. 
The old one had reacted quicker 
than he, perhaps because he was 
poaching, but like himself he was 
attached and could not break 
free. 

“Serves you right,” Kworn pro- 
jected grimly. “The thing was on 
my land. You had no right to 
feed upon it.” 

“Get me loose!” Caada 
screamed. His body flopped at 
the end of a thick mass of diges- 
tive tissue, dangling from the 
line, writhing and struggling in 
mindless terror. It was strange, 
Kworn thought, that fear should 
be so much stronger in the old 
than in the young. 

“Cut loose, you fool,” Kworn 
projected. “There isn’t enough of 
you adhered to hurt if it were 
lost. A little body substance isn’t 
worth your life. Hurry! You’ll be 
too late if you don’t. That metal 
is poisonous to our flesh.” 

“But it will be pain to cut my 
absorbing surface,” Caada pro- 
tested. 



ON THE FOURTH PLANET

I 



“It will be death if you don’t.” 
“Then why don’t you?” 

“I can’t,” Kworn said hopeless- 
ly. “All my surface is stuck to the 
filament. I can’t cut free.” He was 
calm now, resigned to the inevit- 
able. His greed had brought him 
to this. Perhaps it was a fitting 
punishment. But Caada need not 
die if he would show courage. 

He rotated his eye to watch 
his struggling neighbor. Appar- 
ently Caada was going to take 
his advice. The tissue below the 
part of him stuck to the filament 
began to thin. His pseudopod 
broke contact. But his movements 
were slow and hesitant. Already 
his body mass was rising above 
the edge of the disc. 

“Quick, you fool!” Kworn pro- 
jected. “Another moment and 
you’re dead!” 

But Caada couldn’t hear. 
Slowly his tissues separated as 
he reluctantly abandoned his ab- 
sorptive surface. But he was al- 
ready over the disc. The last cells 
pinched off and he fell, mantle 
flapping, full on the surface of 
the disc. For a moment he lay 
there quivering, and then his 
body was blotted from sight by 
a cloud of frozen steam, and his 
essence vanished screaming into 
Emptiness. 

T7~ WORN shuddered. It was a 
terrible way to die. But his 
own fate would be no better. He 



wrapped his mantle tightly 
around him as his leading parts 
vanished into the dark hole in 
the cylinder. In a moment he 
would be following Caada on the 
journey from which no member 
of the Folk had ever returned. 
His body disappeared into the 
hole. 

— and was plunged into para- 
dise! 

His foreparts slipped into a 
warm, thick liquid that loosened 
the adhesive that bound him to 
the cord. As he slipped free, he 
slowly realized that he was not 
to die. He was bathed in liquid 
food! He was swimming in it! 
He was surrounded on all sides 
by incredible flavors so strange 
and delicious that his mind could 
not classify them! The filament 
had been good, but this — this 
was indescribable! He relaxed, 
his mantle spreading through the 
food, savoring, absorbing, digest- 
ing, metabolizing, excreting. His 
energy levels peaked. The nuclei 
of his germ plasm swelled, their 
chromosomes split, and a great 
bud formed and separated from 
his body. He had reproduced! 

Through a deadening fog of 
somatic sensation, he realized 
dully that this was wrong, that 
the time wasn’t right, that the 
space was limited, and that the 
natural reaction to abundant 
food supply was wrong. But for 
the moment he didn’t care.

GALAXY 



For thousands of seasons he 
had traveled the paths between 
equator and pole in a ceaseless 
hunt for food, growing and re- 
juvenating in good seasons, 
shrinking and aging in bad. He 
had been bound to the soil, a 
slave to the harsh demands of 
life and Nature. And now the 
routine was broken. 

He luxuriated in his freedom. 
It must have been like this in 
the old days, when the waters 
were plentiful and things grew 
in them that could be eaten, and 
the Folk had time to dream 
young dreams and think young 
thoughts, and build their thoughts 
and dreams into the gleaming 
realities of cities and machines. 
Those were the days when the 
mind went above the soil into the 
air and beyond it to the moons, 
the sun and the evening stars. 

But that was long ago. 

He lay quietly, conscious of 
the change within him as his cells 
multiplied to replace those he 
had lost, and his body grew in 
weight and size. He was reju- 
venated. The cells of his growing 
body, stimulated by the abund- 
ance of food, released memories 
he had forgotten he had ever 
possessed. His past ran in direct 
cellular continuity to the dawn 
of his race, and in him was every 
memory he had experienced since 
the beginning. Some were weak, 
others were stronger, but all were 

ON THE FOURTH PLANET 



there awaiting an effort of recall. 
All that was required was enough 
stimulation to bring them out of 
hiding. 

And for the first time in mil- 
lennia the stimulus was available. 
The stimulus was growth, the 
rapid growth that only an abun- 
dant food supply could give, the 
sort of growth that the shrunken 
environment outside could not 
supply. With sudden clarity he 
saw how the Folk had shrunk in 
mind and body as they slowly 
adapted to the ever-increasing 
rigor of life. The rushing torrent 
of memory and sensation that 
swept through him gave him a 
new awareness of what he had 
been once and what he had be- 
come. His eye was lifted from the 
dirt and lichens. 

VW^HAT he saw filled him with 
” pity and contempt. Pity 
for what the Folk had become; 
contempt for their failure to rec- 
ognize it. Yet he had been no 
better than the others. It was 
only through the accident of this 
artefact that he had learned. The 
Folk couldn’t know what the slow 
dwindling of their food supply 
had done to them. Over the mil- 
lennia they had adapted, chang- 
ing to fit the changing conditions, 
surviving only because they were 
more intelligent and more tena- 
cious than the other forms of life 
that had become extinct. A thou- 



149 



sand thousand seasons had passed 
since the great war that had 
devastated the world. A million 
years of slow adaptation to the 
barren waste that had been 
formed when the ultimate prod- 
ucts of Folk technology were 
loosed on their creators, had 
created a race tied to a subsis- 
tence level of existence, incapable 
of thinking beyond the basic 
necessities of life. 

The U1 Kworn sighed. It 
would be better if he would not 
remember so much. But he could 
suppress neither the knowledge 
nor the memories. They crowded 
in upon him, stimulated by the 
food in which he floated. 

Beside him, his offspring was 
growing. A bud always grew 
rapidly in a favorable environ- 
ment, and this one was ideal. 
Soon it would be as large as him- 
self. Yet it would never develop 
beyond an infant. It could not 
mature without a transfer of germ 
plasm from other infants of the 
Folk. And there were no infants. 

It would grow and keep on 
growing because there would be 
no check of maturity upon its 
cells. It would remain a partly 
sentient lump of flesh that 
would never be complete. And in 
time it would be dangerous. 
When it had depleted the food 
supply it would turn on him in 
mindless hunger. It wouldn’t 
realize that the U1 Kworn was 



its father, or if it did, it wouldn’t 
care. An infant is ultimately self- 
ish, and its desires are the most 
important thing in its restricted 
universe. 

Kworn considered his situation 
dispassionately. 

It was obvious that he must 
escape from this trap before his 
offspring destroyed him. Yet he 
could think of no way to avoid 
the poison metal. He recognized 
it now, the element with the 
twelve protons in its nucleus, a 
light metal seldom used by the 
Folk even in the days of their 
greatness because of its ability to 
rapidly oxidize and its propensity 
to burst into brillant flame when 
heated. With sudden shock he 
realized that the artefact was 
nothing less than a gigantic 
torch! 

Why had it been built like 
this? What was its function? 
Where had it come from? Why 
hadn’t it spoke since it had re- 
leased that flood of unintelligible 
gibberish before it had drawn 
him inside? Ever since he had 
entered this food tank it had 
been quiet except for a clicking, 
chattering whir that came from 
somewhere above him. He had 
the odd impression that it was 
storing information about him 
and the way he reacted in the 
tank. 

And then, abruptly, it broke 
into voice. Cryptic words poured 



150 



GALAXY 



from it, piercing him with tiny 
knives of sound. The intensity 
and rapidity of the projections 
shocked him, left him quivering 
and shaking when they stopped 
as abruptly as they had begun. 

In the quiet that followed, 
Kworn tried to recall the se- 
quence of the noise. The words 
were like nothing he had ever 
heard. They were not the lan- 
guage of the Folk either past or 
present. And they had a flow 
and sequence that was not or- 
ganic. They were mechanical, 
the product of a metal intelli- 
gence that recorded and spoke 
but did not think. The Folk had 
machines like that once. 

How had it begun? There had 
been a faint preliminary, an al- 
most soundless voice speaking a 
single word. Perhaps if he pro- 
jected it, it would trigger a re- 
sponse. Pitching his voice in the 
same key and intensity he pro- 
jected the word as best he could 
remember it. 

And the voice began again. 

TZ'WORN quivered with ex- 
citement. Something outside 
the artefact was forcing it to 
speak. He was certain of it. As 
certain as he was that the arte- 
fact was recording himself and 
his offspring. But who — or what 
— was receiving the record? And 
why? 

This could be a fascinating 



speculation, Kworn thought. But 
there would be time enough for 
that later. His immediate need 
was to get out. Already the food 
supply was running low, and his 
offspring was becoming enor- 
mous. He’d have to leave soon if 
he was ever going to. And he’d 
have to do something about his 
own growth. Already it was 
reaching dangerous levels. He 
was on the ragged edge of an- 
other reproduction, and he 
couldn’t afford it. 

Regretfully, he began moving 
the cornified cells of his mantle 
and his under layer toward his 
inner surfaces, arranging them in 
a protective layer around his 
germ plasm and absorptive cells. 
There would be enough surface 
absorption to take care of his 
maintenance needs, and his body 
could retain its peak of cellular 
energy. Yet the desire to feed 
and bud was almost overpower- 
ing. His body screamed at him 
for denying it the right that food 
would give it, but Kworn resisted 
the demands of his flesh until the 
frantic cellular urges passed. 

Beside him his offspring 
pulsed with physical sensation. 
Kworn envied it even as he 
pitied it. The poor mindless 
thing could be used as a means 
to the end of his escape, but it 
was useless for anything else. It 
was far too large, and far too 
stupid, to survive in the outside 



ON THE FOURTH PLANET 



151 



world. Kworn extruded a net of 
hairlike pseudopods and swept 
-the tank in which they lay. It 
was featureless, save for a hole 
where the filament had not com- 
pletely withdrawn when it had 
pulled him into this place. A few 
places in the wall had a differ- 
ent texture than the others, prob- 
ably the sense organs of the 
recorder. He rippled with satis- 
faction. There was a grille of 
poison metal in the top of the 
tank through which flowed a 
steady current of warm air. It 
would be pleasant to investigate 
this further, Kworn thought, but 
there was no time. His offspring 
had seen to that. 

He placed his eye on a thin 
pseudopod and thrust it through 
the hole in the wall of the tank. 
It was still night outside, but a 
faint line of brightness along the 
horizon indicated the coming of 
dawn. The artefact glittered 
icily beneath him, and he had a 
feeling of giddiness as he looked 
down the vertiginous drop to 
the disc below. The dark blotch 
of Caada’s burned body was al- 
most invisible against the faintly 
gleaming loom of the still-warm 
disc. Kworn shuddered. Caada 
hadn’t deserved a death like that. 
Kworn looked down, estimating 
the chances with his new intelli- 
gence, and then slapped a thick 
communication fibril against his 
offspring’s quivering flesh and 



hurled a projection at its recoil- 
ing mass. 

Considering the fact that its 
cells were direct derivations of 
his own, Kworn thought grimly, 
it was surprising how hard it 
was to establish control. The 
youngster had developed a sur- 
prising amount of individuality 
in its few xals of free existence. 
He felt a surge of thankfulness 
to the old U1 Kworn as the 
youngster yielded to his firm 
projection. His precursor had al- 
ways sought compliant germ 
plasm to produce what he had 
called “discipline and order.” It 
was, in fact, weakness. It was 
detrimental to survival. But 
right now that weakness was 
essential. 

T TNDER the probing lash of his 
^ projection the infant ex- 
truded a thick mass of tissue that 
met and interlocked with a sim- 
ilar mass of his own. As soon as 
the contact firmed, Kworn began 
flowing toward his eye, which 
was still in the half-open hole in 
the side of the tank. 

The outside cold struck his 
sense centers with spicules of ice 
as he flowed to the outside, cling- 
ing to his offspring’s gradually 
extending pseudopod. Slowly he 
dropped below the cylinder. The 
infant was frantic. It disliked the 
cold and struggled to break free, 
but Kworn clung limpetlike to 



152 



GALAXY 






his offspring’s flesh as it twisted 
and writhed in an effort to return 
to the warmth and comfort into 
which it was born. 

“Let go!” his offspring scream- 
ed. “I don’t like this place.” 

“In a moment,” Kworn said as 
he turned the vague writhings in- 
to a swinging pendulum motion. 
“Help me move back and forth.” 

“I can’t. I’m cold. I hurt. Let 
me go!” 

“Help me,” Kworn ordered 
grimly, “or hang out here and 
freeze.” 

His offspring shuddered and 
twitched. The momentum of the 
swing increased. Kworn tight- 
ened his grip. 

“You promised to let go!” his 
offspring wailed. “You prom — ” 

The infant’s projection was cut 
off as Kworn loosed himself at 
the upward arc of the swing, 
spread his mantle and plummet- 
ed toward the ground. Fear 
swept through him as his body 
curved through the thin air, miss- 
ing the edge of the disc and land- 
ing on the ground with a sense- 
jarring thud. Behind and above 
him up against the cylinder, the 
thick tendril of his offspring’s 
flesh withdrew quickly from 
sight. For a moment the U1 
Kworn’s gaze remained riveted 
on the row of odd markings on 
the metal surface, and then he 
turned his attention to life. 

There was no reason to waste 

ON THE FOURTH PLANET 



the pain of regret upon that half 
sentient mass of tissue that was 
his offspring. The stupid flesh of 
his flesh would remain happy in 
the darkness with the dwindling 
food until its flesh grew great 
enough to touch the poison metal 
in the ceiling of the tank. 

And then — 

With a harsh projection of 
horror, the U1 Kworn moved, cir- 
cling the artefact on Caada’s va- 
cated strip. And as he moved he 
concentrated energy into his 
high-level communication organs, 
and projected a warning of dan- 
ger. 

“Move!” he screamed. “Move 
forward for your lives!” 

The line rippled. Reddish man- 
tles unfolded as the Folk reacted. 
The nearest, shocked from esti- 
vation, were in motion even be- 
fore they came to full awareness. 
Alarms like this weren’t given 
without reason. 

Varsi’s reaction, Kworn noted, 
was faster than any of his fel- 
lows. The young U1 had some 
favorable self-preservation char- 
acteristics. He’d have to consider 
sharing some germ plasm with 
him at the next reproduction 
season, after all. 

In a giant arc, the Folk pressed 
forward under the white glow of 
emerging dawn. Behind them the 
artefact began to project again in 
its strange tongue. But in mid- 
cry it stopped abruptly. And 



153 



from it came a wail of mindless 
agony that tore at Kwom’s mind 
with regret more bitter because 
nothing could be done about it. 

His offspring had touched the 
poison metal. 

Kworn turned his eye back- 
wards. The artefact was shaking 
on its broad base from the vio- 
lence of his offspring’s tortured 
writhings. As he watched a bril- 
liant burst of light flared from its 
top. Heat swept across the land, 
searing the lichens and a scat- 
tered few of the Folk too slow to 
escape. The giant structure 
burned with a light more brilliant 
than the sun and left behind a 
great cloud of white vapor that 
hung on the air like the menacing 
cloud of a samshin. Beneath the 
cloud the land was bare save for 
a few twisted pieces of smoking 
metal. 

The roadblock was gone. 

T/WORN moved slowly for- 
ward, gleaning Caada’s strip 
and half of his own which he 
shared with Varsi. 

He would need that young U1 
in the future. It was well to place 
him under an obligation. The 
new thoughts and old memories 
weren’t dying. They remained, 
and were focused upon the idea 
of living better than at this sub- 
sistence level. It should be pos- 
sible to grow lichens, and breed 
a more prolific type of lichen 



feeder. Water channeled from 
the canals would stimulate lichen 
growth a thousand-fold. And with 
a more abundant food supply, 
perhaps some of the Folk could 
be stimulated to think and apply 
ancient buried skills to circum- 
vent Nature. 

It was theoretically possible. 
The new breed would have to be 
like Varsi, tough, driving and 
selfishly independent. In time 
they might inherit the world. 
Civilization could arise again. It 
was not impossible. 

His thoughts turned briefly 
back to the artefact. It still both- 
ered him. He still knew far too 
little about it. It was a fascinat- 
ing speculation to dream of what 
it might have been. At any rate, 
one thing was sure. It was not a 
structure of his race. If nothing 
else, those cabalistic markings on 
the side of the cylinder were ut- 
terly alien. 




Thoughtfully he traced them 
in the sand. What did they mean?

/AF THE many science-fiction 
authors of some thirty years 
ago only a tiny group is still ac- 
tive today. One of the real giants 
of the day was Jack Williamson, 
a special favorite of mine. Exact- 
ly three decades ago, I compiled 
a personal checklist of his works, 
up to and including his latest, 
“The Stone from the Green Star” 
(how many of you remember 
that one?) and discovered, with 
no surprise at all, that I had read 
every one. 

However, he had his greatest 
productive period still ahead of 
him. He had yet to write what 



must rank as his greatest popu- 
lar successes: The Le&ion of 

Space, The Cometeers and The 
Le&iort of Time. 

Although these are space op- 
eras in the heroic mold, William- 
son was never more than the 
light-heavyweight king as com- 
pared to the co-holders of the 
super-dreadnaught class, “Doc” 
Smith and John W. Campbell, 
Jr. The old stories don’t stand 
the difficult re-reading test too 
well; but it is very much to Wil- 
liamson’s credit that he has been 
able to make the exceedingly 
difficult adjustment of style and

THE TRIAL OF TERRA by 
Jack Williamson. Ace. 

His latest book exemplifies 
vividly the good and bad sides 
of Williamson’s writing. Origi- 
nally a group of shorter stories, 
they have been bound, unwisely, 
I think, into novel form by means 
of a most awkward as well as 
most indigestible central theme. 

Earth is under surveillance by 
an interstellar civilization that 
will determine whether Mankind 
is truly human and thus entitled 
to join the federation as an equal, 
or to be destroyed in the conver- 
sion of Sol into a navigational 
marker beacon. So far this is old 
hat, Williamson being the umpty- 
umpth writer with this plot. 
What won’t stay down, however, 
is his premise that his intragalac- 
tic civilization can function de- 
spite the Einsteinian limitations 
the plot places upon communica- 
tion and travel. 

Terra’s judge, whose decision 
is the sole determinant of Earth’s 
fate, voyages fifty years, objec- 
tive time, to sit in judgment be- 
cause Man is about to make Con- 
tact. 

A Prince of a matriarchy takes 
a short interstellar trip while 
his infant fiancee ripens into ma- 
turity. 

Intriguing, no doubt, but the 
imagination boggles at the in- 



surmountable problems of con- 
ducting the business of any civ- 
ilization under such impossible 
disjointments. 

The individual stories, fortu- 
nately, are themselves good, 
standing out like sparkling gems 
in a tarnished setting. As indi- 
vidual novelettes they cannot be 
denied their well-deserved

I remember well my first in- 
troduction to the work of “World 
Wrecker” Edmond Hamilton. Al- 
though almost nothing of the 
story remains with me, the im- 
pact of the old Amazing Quar- 
terly cover does (How long ago, 
thirty-three years?) with its tur- 
tle people, its predominantly yel- 
low background and the magic 
of its title, The Other Side of the 
Moon. Hamilton, a prolific writer, 
knew his market well and wrote 
stories that sold. Certainly no 
one suspected that in the breast 
of the author of countless Capt. 
Future yarns beat a desire to 
write realism. (See last month’s 
Five Star Shelf. What’s It Like 
Out There, penned in the middle 
Thirties, earned horrified rejec- 
tion slips and didn’t see publica- 
tion until the field finally caught 
up with it many years later.) 

THE HAUNTED STARS by Ed- 
mond Hamilton. Pyramid. 

This paperback reprint of a 



156 



GALAXY 



recent hard cover novel is an ex- 
cellent example of Hamilton’s 
metamorphosis from purveyor of 
commercial-type space opera to 
sensitive portrayer of recogniza- 
ble people in strange situations 
and environments. 

The Hamilton and Williamson 
yarns make for interesting con- 
trast. Where Williamson sees 
Earth as the long-forgotten cradle 
of Mankind, Hamilton visualizes 
Man as the foster-child of Foster- 
Mother Earth, abandoned de- 
scendant of an interstellar em- 
pire that was wiped from the 
spaceways some thirty thousand 
years ago as aftermath of a cata- 
clysmic war with another species. 

The plot concerns the dis- 
covery of the thirty thousand 
year old wreckage of a star-ship 
on the Moon, decipherment of 
the ancient language and the 
building of a ship secret from 
the Russians. Hamilton then 
sends his somewhat less-than- 
shining heroes in search of our 
lost heritage on the Home World. 

The most noticeable feature 
of Hamilton’s turnabout is the 
fact that almost all conflict stems 
from antagonisms within the ex- 
ploratory group rather than from 
the machinations of the mysteri- 
ous aliens, and this despite the 
fact that Hamilton has imbued 
them with powers even beyond 
those of his halcyon days of cos- 
mic demolition. 



Hamilton was extra careful 
with his story ending and you 
should be, to. It’s loaded.

MARS IS MY DESTINATION 
by Frank Belknap Long. Pyra- 
mid. 

Although Long’s span of pro- 
ductivity is equal to that of the 
others under discussion, he was 
never a writer of the Big Story. 
His output was limited mainly 
to shorts and novelettes of which 
none were memorable like those 
of Stanley G. Weinbaum, the 
early Heinleins, the first van 
Vogts or the Campbell — Don A. 
Stuart stunners, even though he 
maintained a high standard of 
workmanship. 

However, in this novel, a trans- 
planted Western, Long’s hero is 
pinned with the silver wings 
(sheriff’s badge) of the supreme 
law officer and brought to Mars 
to quell the bitter internecine 
warfare between two huge power 
combines (big-time ranching and 
homesteading). His method of 
defusing this explosive situation 
is to beat up the Bad Guy who 
heads one of the combines, aided 
by the Semi-Good Guy who 
heads up the other. 

The only two things that dif- 
ferentiate this from a standard 
Western are the wearing of a 
dark uniform by the hero and 
the “stream of consciousness”

THE HUGO WINNERS edited 
by Isaac Asimov. Doubleday. 

The amazing durability of 
some of these should-be crotchety 
old-timers is wonderfully illus- 
trated by Asimov’s collection of 
prize-winning stories chosen as 
best of their class at several re- 
cent World Science Fiction Con- 
ventions. 

Murray Leinster has been a 
household name in SF circles for 
so long that it almost seems as 
if “Will F. Jenkins” is his pseu- 
donym instead of the other way 
around. It is hard to realize that 
his story The Runaway Sky- 
scraper appeared in June, 1926, 
issue number three of Amazing 
Stories, the grandpappy of all SF 
mags. And it’s therefore doubly 
astonishing that he should be able 
to adapt to the considerable 
change in the genre so success- 
fully that his novelette, Colonial 
Survey, should waltz off with top 
honors. (On sober second thought, 
though, one remembers that his 
novella Sidewise in Time opened 



158 



GALAXY 






a whole new subdivision for ex- 
ploit back in 1934.) 

Another umpty-genarian who 
is still knocking out topnotch 
stories is Clifford Simak who, 
although not as ancient as Lein- 
ster, first saw print in the old 
Wonder Stories with World of 
the Red Sun. Aside from such 
memorable novels as Time 
Quarry, Ring Around the Sun 
and the haunting “City” series, 
Simak has produced a number of 
puzzle stories that are as intri- 
guing as anything being written. 
A prime example is his prize- 
winner, The Big Back Yard. 

This is a sure-fire collection of 
Can’t Misses. Nine prize-winning 
stories selected by vote as best- 
of-the-year have to be something 
extra special, an anthologist’s 
dream of Paradise. Lucky-stiff 
Asimov crows about his good for- 
tune in some delightful comments 
that further enliven a delightful 
book. 

Younger authors represented: 
A. Clarke, W. M. Miller, Jr., E. 
F. Russell, A. Davidson, R. Block, 
D. Keyes, P. Anderson. 

Rating: (what else?) ***** 

To return to the incredible 
Mr. Leinster; for a chiller-thriller 



session, try The Forgotten Planet 
(Ace) on for size. Based on Mad 
Planet and Red Dust that first 
appeared in the Amazing Stories 
in 1926 and 1927, it’s quite a 
reading experience. 

ALL THE TRAPS OF EARTH 
by Clifford D. Simak. Double- 
day. 

Coming back to Old Man 
Simak, here is an excellently rep- 
resentative volume of his work 
in short story and novelette 
length. The plots vary from a 
time travel project, Project Mas- 
todon, to the sales resistance en- 
countered on Garson IV by a 
joint robot and human sales team 
from Central Trading in Install- 
ment Plan. Or from the hunting 
of a deadly alien in a typical 
Midwestern town in Good Night, 
Mr. James to the equally deadly, 
but completely innocuous seem- 
ing alien life encountered by an 
exploratory team in Drop Dead. 

But, whatever the motivations, 
Simak’s humans, robots and an- 
droids are just plain folks, com- 
pletely credible and interesting. 
So are the stories and long may 
Simak wave.

UT DON’T see why we have to 
be here,” a crewman said. 
“He ain’t liable to say anything.” 
“He shore better,” the man in 
front of him said loudly. 

“Be still,” his wife said. 
“People’s lookin’ at ya.” 

“I don’t care a smidgen,” he 
said, “if en they ayre.” 

“Please,” she said. 

“Joanne Marie,” he said, “you 
know that when I aims ta do 
somethin’, I’m jest natcher’lly 
bound to do hit. An’ iffen I aims 
ta talk . .” 

“Here comes the priest. Now, 
be still.” 

The man looked up. “So he do; 
an’ I’ll tell ya, hit shore is time 
he’s a-gittin’ hyere. I ain’t got no 
all night fer ta sit.” 

The crewman to his left bent 
over and whispered, “I’ll bet he’s 
gonna tell us it’s gonna be an- 
other postponement.” 

“Iffen he does, I’m jest a-gonna 
stand up an’ yell right out that I 
ain’t gonna stand fer hit no 
longer.” 

“Now, dear,” said Joanne 
Marie, “the captain can hear ya, 
if you’re gonna talk so loud.” 

“I hope he does; I jest hope he 
does. He’s th’ one that’s a-keepin’ 
us all from our Reward, an’ I jest 
hope he does heyar me, so he’ll 
know I’m a-gittin’ mighty tyird uv 
waitin’.”

“You tell ’im!” someone said 
from two rows behind him. 

HPHE captain, in the officer’s sec- 
tion, sat very straight and 
tall. He was studiously ignoring 
the crew. This confined his field 
of vision to the left half of the 
recreation area. While the priest 
stood before the speaker’s ros- 
trum waiting for silence, the cap- 
tain reached back with great dig- 
nity and scratched his right 
shoulderblade. 

Nestir, the priest, was dressed 
out in the full ceremonial costume 
of office. His high, strapless boots 
glistened with polish. His fez 
perched jauntily on his shiny, 
shaven head. The baldness was 
symbolic of diligent mental appli- 
cation to abstruse points of doc- 
trine. Cotian exentiati pablum re 
overum est: “Grass grows not in 
the middle of a busy thorough- 
fare.” The baldness was the result 
of the diligent application of an 
effective depilatory. His blood-red 
cloak had been freshly cleaned 
for the occasion, and it rustled 
around him in silky sibilants. 

“Men,” he said. And then, more 
loudly, “Men!” 

The hiss and sputter of conver- 
sation guttered away. 

“Men,” he said. 

“The other evening,” he said, 
“ — Gelday it was, to be exact — 
one of the crew came to me with a 
complaint.” 



“Well, I’ll be damned,” Joanne 
Marie’s husband said loudly. 

Nestir cleared his throat. “It 
was about the Casting Off. That’s 
why I called you all together to- 
day.” He stared away, at a point 
over the head and to the rear of 
the audience. 

“It puts me in mind of the par- 
able of the six Vergios.” 

Joanne Marie’s husband sighed 
deeply. 

“Three, you will recall, were 
wise. When Prophet was at Meiz- 
que, they came to him and said, 
‘Prophet, we are afflicted. We 
have great sores upon our bodies.’ 
The Prophet looked at them and 
did see that it was true. Then he 
blessed them and took out His 
knife and lay open their sores. 
For which the three wise Vergios 
were passing grateful. And within 
the last week, they were dead of 
infection. But three were foolish 
and hid their sores; and these 
three did live.” 

The captain rubbed his nose. 

“Calex i pundendem hoy, my 
children. ‘Secrecy makes for a 
long life,’ as it says in the Jarcon.” 
Nestir tugged behind him at his 
cloak. 

“I want you all to remember 
that little story. I want you all to 
take it away from here with you 
and think about it, tonight, in the 
privacy of your cabins. 

“And like the three wise Ver- 
gios who went to the Prophet,

one of the crewmen came to me. 
He came to me, and he said: 
‘Father, I am weary of sailing.’ 

“Yes, he said, ‘I am weary of 
sailing.’ 

“Now, don’t you think I don’t 
know that. Every one of you — 
every blessed one of you — is 
weary of sailing. I know that as 
well as I know my own name, yes. 

“But because he came to me 
and said, ‘Father, I am weary of 
sailing,’ I went to the captain, and 
I said, ‘Captain, the men are 
I weary of sailing.’ 

“And then the captain- said: ‘All 
right, Father,’ he said, ‘I will set 
the day for the Festival of the 
] Casting Off!’ ” 

i r | 'HE little fellow was pleased 
| by the rustle of approval 

from the audience. “God damn, 
hit’s about time!” Joanne Marie’s 
husband said. 

Nestir cleared his throat again. 

“Hummm. Uh. And the day is 
not very far distant,” said Nestir. 

“I knowed there was a catch to 
hit,’ 1 Joanne Marie’s husband 
said. 

“I know you will have many 
questions; yes, I know you will 
have — ah, ah — well, many 
questions. You are thinking: 
‘What kind of a Festival can we 
have here on this ship?’ You are 
; thinking: ‘What a fine thing — ah, 
what a good thing, that is — ah, 
how nice it would be to have the 

VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



Casting Off at home, among 
friends.’ ” 

Nestir waved his hands. “Well, 
I just want to tell you: I come 
from Koltah. And you know that 
Koltah never let any city state 
outdo her in a Festival, uh-huh. 

“The arena in Koltah is the 
greatest arena in the whole sys- 
tem. We have as many as sixty 
thousand accepted applicants. All 
of them together in the arena is 
a — uh, uh, well. — a sight to be- 
hold. People come from all over 
to behold it. I never will forget 
the Festival at which my father 
was accepted. He . 

“Well, the point I want to make 
is this: I just wanted to tell you 
that I know what a Festival 
should be, and the captain and I 
will do everything in our power 
to make our Casting Off as won- 
derful as any anywhere. 

“And I want to tell you that if 
you’ll come to me with your sug- 
gestions, I’ll do all I can to see 
that we do this thing just the way 
you want it done. I want you to 
be proud of this Casting Off Fes- 
tival, so you can look back on it 
and say, uh, uh — this day was 
the real high point of your whole 
life!” 

Everyone but Joanne Marie’s 
husband cheered. He sat glumly 
muttering to himself. 

Nestir bobbed his shiny head 
at them and beamed his cherubic 
smile. And noticed that there was 



163 



a little blonde, one of the crew- 
men’s wives, in the front row that 
had very cute ankles. 

While they were still cheering 
and stomping and otherwise ex- 
pressing their enthusiasm and ap- 
proval, Nestir walked off the 
speaker’s platform and into the 
officer’s corridor. He wiped his 
forehead indecorously on the hem 
of his cloak and felt quite relieved 
that the announcement was over 
with and the public speaking 
done. 

II 

TAINNER that evening was a 
gala occasion aboard the 
ship. The steward ordered the 
holiday feast prepared in celebra- 
tion of Nestir’s announcement. 
And, for the officers, he broke out 
of the special cellar the last case 
allotment for Crew One of the 
delicate Colta Barauche (’94). 
He ordered the messman to put 
a bottle of it to the right of each 
plate. 

The captain came down from 
his stateroom after the meal had 
begun. He nodded curtly to the 
officers when he entered the mess 
hall, walked directly to his place 
at the head of the table, sat down 
and morosely began to work the 
cork out of his wine bottle with 
his teeth. 

“You’ll spoil the flavor, shaking 
it that way,” the third mate cau- 



tioned. He was particularly fond 
of that year. 

The captain twisted the bottle 
savagely, and the cork came free 
with a little pop. He removed the 
cork from between his teeth, 
placed it very carefully beside his 
fork, and poured himself a full 
glass of the wine. 

“Very probably,” he said sadly. 

“I don’t think hit’ll do hit,” the 
first mate said. “He hain’t shook 
hard enough to matter.” 

The captain picked up the 
glass, brought it toward his lips 
— then, suddenly having thought 
of something, he put it back down 
and turned to Nestir. 

“I say. Have you decided on 
this Carstar thing yet, Father?” 

The little priest looked up. He 
laid his knife across the rim of 
his. plate. “It has ramifications,” 
he said. 

When the third mate saw that 
his opinion on the wine was not 
immediately to be justified, he 
settled back in his chair with a 
little sigh of disapproval. 

“Well, what do you think your 
decision will be, Father?” the 
steward asked. 

Nestir picked up his knife and 
fork and cut off a piece of meat. 
“Hummmm,” he said. “It’s hard to 
say. The whole issue involves, as 
a core point, the principle of 
casta cum mae stotiti.” 

The first mate nodded sagely. 

“The intent, of course, could 



164 



GALAXY 



actually be — ah — sub mailloux; 
and in that event, naturally, the 
decision would be even more dif- 
ficult. I wish I could talk to higher 
authority about it; but of course I 
haven’t the time. I’ll have to de- 
cide something.” 

um had a very pretty wife,” 
the third mate said. 

“Yes, very.” Nestir agreed. “But 
as I was saying, if it could be 
proven that the culstem fell due 
to no negligence on his part, 
either consciously or subconsci- 
ously, then the obvious conclu- 
sion would be that no stigma 
would be attached.” He speared 
his meat and chewed it thought- 
fully. 

“But it wasn’t at all bloody,” 
the wife of the second mate said. 
“I scarcely think he felt it at all. 
It happened too fast.” 

Nestir swallowed the mouthful 
of food and washed it down with 
a gulp of wine. 

“The problem, my dear Helen,” 
he said, “is one of intent. To raise 
the issue of concomitant agonies 
is to confuse the whole matter. 
For instance. Take Wilson, in my 
home state of Koltah. Certainly 
he died as miserable a death as 
anyone could desire.” 

“Yes,” said the second mate’s 
wife. “I remember that. I read 
about it in the newspapers.” 

“But it was a case of obvious 
intent,” continued Nestir, “and 



therefore constituted a clear out 
attempt to avoid his duty by has- 
tening to his Reward.” 

Upon hearing the word duty, 
the captain brightened. 

“That,” he said to Nestir, “my 
dear Father, is the cardinal point 
of the whole game, y’know.” He 
scratched the back of his left 
hand. “Duty. And I must say, I 
think you’re being quite short- 
sighted about the Casting Off 
date. After all, it’s not only a ques- 
tion of how we go, but also a 
question of leaving only after hav- 
ing done our duty. And that’s 
equally important.” 

“The Synod of Cathau — -” Nes- 
tir began. 

“Plague take it, Father! Really, 
now, I must say. The Synod 
Cathau! Certainly you’ve misin- 
terpreted that. Anticipation can 
be a joy, y’know: almost equal to 
the very Reward. Anticipation 
should spur man in duty. It’s all 
noble and self sacrificing.” He 
scratched the back of his right 
hand. 

The second mate had been try- 
ing to get a word in edgewise for 
several minutes; he finally suc- 
ceeded by utilizing the temporary 
silence following the captain’s 
outburst. 

“You don’t need to worry about 
your Casting Off, Captain. You 
can leave that to me. I assure you, 
I have in mind a most ingenious 
method.” 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



165 



T HE captain was not visibly 
cheered; he was still brood- 
ing about the sad absence of a 
sense of duty on the part of Nes- 
tir. “I will welcome it,” he said, 
“at the proper time, sir. And I cer- 
tainly hope — ” His eyes swept the 
table. “I certainly hope to be Cast 
Off by an officer. It would be very 
humiliating, y’know, to have a 
crew member do it.” 

“Oh, very,” said the steward. 

“I don’t know,” the second 
mate’s wife said, “whether you 
better count on my husband or 
not. I have my own plans for 
him.” 

“This problem of Carstar inter- 
ests me,” the third mate said. 
“Did I ever tell you about my 
wife? She strangled our second 
baby.” 

“He was a very annoying 
child,” his wife said. 

“He probably wouldn’t have 
lived, anyway,” the third mate 
said. “Puny baby.” 

“That,” said Nestir, “is not at 
all like the Carstar case. Not at 
all. Yours is a question of saliex y 
cuminzund.” 

The first mate nodded. 

“It seems to me that the whole 
thing would depend on the intent 
of the strangler.” 

“Captain,” the steward said, 
“you really must let me give you 
some of that salve.” 

“That’s very kind of you, but 
I . ” 



“No bother at all,” the steward 
said. 

“As I see it,” Nestir said, “if the 
intent was the natural maternal 
instinct of the mother to release 
her child from its duty, then . 

“Oh, not at all,” the third 
mate’s wife said. “I did it to make 
him stop crying.” 

“Well, in that case, I see no 
reason why he shouldn’t get his 
Reward.” 

“I certainly hope so,” the third 
mate said. “Jane worries about it 
all the time.” 

“I do not,” Jane contradicted. 

“Now, honey, you know you do 
so.” 

At that moment, he lost inter- 
est in his wife and leaned across 
the table toward the captain, 
“Well?” he asked. 

The captain rolled the wine 
over his tongue. “You were right, 
of course.” 

The third mate turned tri- 
umphantly to the first mate. 
“There, I told you so.” 

The first mate shrugged. “I 
never do say nothin’ right,” he 
said. “I hain’t got no luck. I’ve 
spent more years un all ya, car- 
penterin’ up a duty log that’s bet- 
ter un even th’ captain’s. An’ hit’s 
Martha an’ me that gotta wait 
an’ help th’ next crew. Lord above 
knows how long time hit’ll be 
afore we uns’ll got ta have a 
Festival.” 

“Oh, really, now. Now. Duty, 



166 



GALAXY 



duty,” the captain reprimanded 
him mildly. 

“Duty! Duty! Duty! You all ur 
in a conspiracy. You all want me 
ta die uv old age.” 

“Nonsense,” said the steward. 
“We don’t want anything of the 
sort. After all, someone has to 
orient the new crew.” 

“Quite right,” said the captain. 
“You ought to be proud.” 

nPHE first mate slammed his 
napkin in the middle of his 
food and stalked out of the mess 
hall. 

“Quite touchy today,” Nestir 
observed. 

“By the way,” the third mate 
said. “Wanda gave me a petition 
to give to you, Father.” 

“Wanda?” 

“Yes. She’s sixteen, now.” 
“Wanda who?” the steward 
asked. 

“Wanda Miller, the bosun’s 
daughter.” 

“I know her,” Helen said. 

“She’s the oldest child on the 
ship, and she wants you to sign 
her adult petition so she can be 
in the Festival, Father.” 

“She’s so young . .” 

“Sixteen, Father.” 

“After all, one must have done 
some duty,” the captain said. 

“He wants you to sign it so he 
can take her in the Changing of 
the Wives,” Jane said. 

Nestir fidgeted uncomfortably. 



“Well, 1 11 look at her record,” he 
said. 

“It’s an idea,” the second mate 
said. “Otherwise, we’ll be short 
one woman.” 

“There wouldn’t be one short 
if he had brought a wife,” the first 
mate’s wife said, looking squarely 
at the captain. 

“Now, Martha. I place duty 
above pleasure. You’re just angry, 
y’know, because you have to stay 
with your husband.” 

“All right, so I am. But it’s true. 
And if Carstar hadn’t been killed, 
there would have been two short.” 
She shot a wicked glance at Nes- 
tir. “Why don’t you and him share 
a woman — ” 

“Martha!” 

“Although the Prophet knows 
what woman in her right mind 
would consent to ... ” 

“Well,” said Nestir hesitantly. 

“Listen,” the third mate said, 
“the second’s right. If you don’t 
sign it, someone will have to do 
without a woman.” 

Nestir blushed. “I’ll look it over 
very carefully, but you must real- 
ize that the priestcraft . .” 

“Actually, in a way, it would be 
her duty to, you see. Think of it 
like that: as her way to do her 
duty.” 

“She’s too young for you, dear,” 
Jane said to her husband. 

“Oh, I don’t know,” the stew- 
ard said. “Sometimes they’re the 
best, I hear.”

r I ''HE third mate, whose name 
was Harry, stood before the 
mirror combing his hair. He had 
been combing his hair for the last 
fifteen minutes. 

“I suppose the crew is celebrat- 
ing?” his wife said. 

“I suppose.” 

She stood up and walked over 
to the dresser. Absently she be- 
gan to finger the articles on it. 

“You really shouldn’t have 
told them about little Glenn to- 
night.” 

“Pish-tush.” 

“No, Harry. I mean it. Helen 
looked at me strangely all 
through dinner. She has three 
children, you know.” 

“You’re imagining things.” 

“But she does have three chil- 
dren.” 

“I mean about her looking at 
you.” 

“Oh.” 

Harry fiddled with his tie 
without speaking. 

“I mean, as much as to say: 
‘Well, I raised all of mine.’ ” 

“But honey, about little Glenn. 
That was an accident, almost. 
You didn’t really mean to choke 
him that hard.” 

“But still ... it ... I mean,

“No,” he said. “That’s nonsense, 



Jane. Sheer nonsense. You know 
what the priest said.” 

He polished one of his brass 
buttons with the sleeve of his 
coat. 

“Harry?” 

“Yes?” 

“I don’t think all that is neces- 
sary just to go on duty.” 
“Probably not.” 

She walked to the bed and sat 
down. “Harry?” 

“Yes, dear?” 

“Don’t you really think she’s 
awful young?” 

“Huh-uh.” 

“I mean, why don’t you pick 
someone else? Like Mary? She’s 
awful sweet. I’ll bet she’d be bet- 
ter.” 

“Probably.” 

“She’s a lot of fun.” 

He brushed at his hair again. 
“Who do you want, Jane?” 

“Oh, I don’t know.” She looked 
down at her legs, raised them up 
from the floor and held them out 
in front of her. “I think I’d kind of 
like Nestir. With his funny bald 
head. I hope he asks me.” 

“I’ll mention it to him.” 

“Would you really, Harry? 
That would be sweet.” 

“Sure, honey.” He looked down 
at his watch. 

“Harry? Are you going to meet 
Wanda in the control room?” 
“Uh-huh.” 

“I thought so. Well, remember 
this, dear: It isn’t the day of the 



168 



GALAXY 



Changing of the Wives yet. Don’t 
forget.” 

“Honey! You don’t think for a 
minute that. .” 

“No, dear. I know you wouldn’t. 
But just don’t, I mean.” 

TTE walked over and kissed her 
forehead and patted her 
cheek. “Course not,” he said, 
comfortingly. 

He left her sitting on the bed 
and strolled down the officers’ 
corridor, whistling. 

He made a mental note to have 
the bosun send some of the crew 
in tomorrow to wash down these 
bulkheads. They needed it. In one 
corner a spider spun its silver 
web. -s, 

He jogged up the companion- 
way, turned left and felt the air 
as fresh as spring when he step- 
ped under the great ventilator. 

And beneath it lay one of the 
crew. 

He kicked the man several 
times in the ribs until he came to 
consciousness. 

“Can’t sleep here, my man,” 
Harry explained. 

“A www. Go way an’ le’ me 
’lone, huh?” 

“Here. Here.” He pulled the fel- 
low erect and slapped him in the 
face briskly. “This is the officers’ 
corridor.” 

“Oh? Ish it? Schorry. Shore 
schorry, shir. So schorry.” 

Harry assisted him to the 



crew’s corridor where he sank to 
the floor and relapsed once more 
into a profound slumber. 

Harry continued on to the con- 
trol room. 

When he entered it, the second 
mate was yawning. 

“Hi, John. Sleepy?” 

“Uh-huh. You’re early.” 

“Don’t mind, do you?” 

“No . Quiet tonight. Had to 
cut the motors an hour ago. Con- 
trol technician passed out.” 

“Oh?” 

The second mate took out a 
cigarette and lit it. “Can’t blow 
the ship up, you know. Look like 
hell on the record. Hope the cap- 
tain don’t find out about it, 
though. He’ll figure the man was 
neglecting his duty.” 

He blew a smoke ring. 

“Might even bar him from the 
Festival.” 

“Yeah,” said Harry, “the cap- 
tain’s funny that way.” 

The second mate blew another 
smoke ring. 

“Well,” Harry said. 

“Uh, Harry? Are you really go- 
ing to take that Wanda girl?” 

“If Nestir lets me.” 

“Say. Harry. Do you suppose 
your wife would . .?” 

T TARRY crossed to the second 
mate and put a hand on his 
shoulder. “Sorry, old fellow. She’s 
got it in her head to take Nestir.” 
He shrugged. “I don’t exactly ap- 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



169 



prove, of course, but . I’m sure 
if he doesn’t want her, she’d be 
glad to hear your offer.” 

“Aw, that’s all right,” John said. 
“Don’t really matter. Say. By the 
way. Have I told you what I in- 
tend to do to the captain? I’ve got 
it all thought out. You know that 
saber I picked up on Queglat? 
Well . .” 

“Look. How about telling me 
another time?” 

“Uh, Sure. If you say so. Uh?” 

“I’m kind of expecting Wanda.” 

“Oh. Sure. I should have known 
you weren’t here early for noth- 
ing. In that case, I better be shov- 
ing off. Luck.” 

“Thanks. See you at breakfast.” 

“Right-o.” 

After the second mate left, 
Harry walked over to the control 
panel. The jet lights were dead. 
He picked up the intercom and 
switched over the engine call bell. 
“ ’Lo,” he said into the micro- 
phone. “This is the bridge . Oh, 
hi, Barney. Harry . Have you 
got a sober control technician 
down there yet? . Fine. We’ll 
start the jets again. If the captain 
comes in now — well, you know 
how he is . Okay, thanks. 
Night.” 

He replaced the microphone. 
He reached over and threw the 
forward firing lever. The jet lights 
came on and the ship began to 
brake acceleration again. 

Having done that, he switched 



on the space viewer. The steady 
buzz of the equipment warming 
sounded in his ears. Wanda would 
be sure to want to look at the 
stars. She was simple minded. 
“Hello.” 

He swiveled around. “Oh, hello, 
Wanda, honey.” 

“Hello, Haireee. Are you glad 
little ol’ me could come, huh?” 
“Sure am.” 

“Me, too. Can I look at the — 
oh. It’s already on.” 

“Uh-huh. Look. Wanda.” 
“Hum?” 

“I talked to Nestir today.” 
“Goody. What did he say, huh? 

I can be an adult and get to play 
in the Festival, can I?” 

“I don’t know, yet. He’s think- 
ing about it. That’s why I want to 
see you. He’s going to check your 
record. And Wanda?” 

“Them stars shore are purty.” 
“Wanda, listen to me.” 

“I’m a-listenin’, Haireee.” 
“You’re simply going to have to 
stop carrying that doll around 
with you if you want to be an 
adult.” 

TN Nestir’s cabin the next morn- 
ing, the captain and the 
priest held a conference. 

“No, Captain. I’m afraid I can’t 
agree to that,” Nestir said. 

The captain said, “Oh, don’t be 
unreasonable, Father. After all, 
this is a ship, yTcnow. And I am, 
after all, the captain.” 



170 



GALAXY 



Nestir shook his head. “The 
crew and the officers will partici- 
pate together in the Festival. I 
will not put the officers’ corridor 
off limits, and — Oh! Yes? Come 
in!” 

The door opened. “Father?” 
“Yes, my son? Come in.” 
“Thank you, Father. Good 
morning, Captain, sir.” 

“Sit down, my son. Now, Cap- 
tain, as I was saying: no segrega- 
tion. It’s contrary to the spirit, if 
not the wording, of the Jarcon.” 
“But Father! A crewman! In 
the officers’ corridor! Think!” 
“Before the Prophet, we are all 
equal. I’m sorry, Captain. Now on 
Koltah, we practiced it with very 
good results, and . .” 

“I say, really — ” 

“Father?” said the crewman 
who had just entered. 

“Yes, my son. In one moment. 
Now, Captain. As I have been ex- 
plaining: The arena method has 
advantages. In Koltah we always 
used it. But here — due to the — 
ah — exigencies of deep space — 
I feel convinced that d>departure 
from normal procedure is war- 
ranted. It is not without prece- 
dent. Such things were fairly com- 
mon, in astoli tavoro, up until 
centralization, three hundred 
years before Allth. Indeed, in my 
home city — Koltah — in the 
year of the seventh plague, a most 
unusual expedient was adopted. 
It seems . .” 



“You’re perfectly correct, of 
course,” the captain said. 

“That’s just what I wanted to 
see you about, Father,” the crew- 
man said. “Now, in my city state 
of Xi, for the Festivals, we . .” 
“Shut up,” said the captain 
softly. 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Now, as I was saying, Cap- 
tain, when the methods used 
in . .” 

“If you’ll excuse me, Father, I 
really should return to duty,” said 
the crewman. 

“Quite all right, my son. Close 
the door after you.” 

“I must say, fellow, your sense 
of duty is commendable.” 

“Well, uh, thank you, sir. And 
thank you, Father, for your time.” 
“Quite all right, my son. That’s 
what I’m here for. Come in as 
often as you like.” 

The crewman closed the door 
after him. 

TTE had been gone only a mo- 
* ment, scarcely time for Nes- 
tir to get properly launched on 
his account, when Harry, the third 
mate, knocked on the door and 
was admitted. 

“Oh? Good morning, Captain. I 
didn’t know you were here.” 
Then, to the priest: “I’ll come 
back later, Father.” 

“Nonsense,” said the captain. 
“Come in.” 

“Well, I had hoped to to see 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



171 



the Father for a minute on . 
private business.” 

“I have to be toddling along,” 
said the captain. 

“But Captain! I haven’t fin- 
ished telling you about. .” 

“I’ll just go down and get a cup 
of coffee,” the captain said. 

“I’ll call you when I’m 
through,” said Harry. 

The captain left the room. 

“It’s about Wanda, Father,” 
said the third mate. 

The priest studied the table 
top. He rearranged some papers. 
“Ah, yes. The young girl.” 

“Well, I mean, it’s not only 
about Wanda,” said Harry. “You 
see, my wife, Jane, that is . .” 
“Yes?” said the priest. He took 
his pen out of the holder. 

“I think, with the proper . 
ah . you know. What I mean is, 
I think she might look with favor 
on you in the Changing of the 
Wives, if I said a few well chosen 
words in your behalf.” 

“That is very flattering, my 
son.” He returned the pen to the 
holder. “Such bounty, as it says 
in the Jarcon, is cuff tensio.” 

“And with your permission, 
Father ...” 

“Ah . 

“She’s a very pretty woman.” 
“Ah . Quite so.” 

“Well, about Wanda. I really 
shouldn’t mention this. But 
Father, if we are short one 
woman . .” 



“Hummmm.” 

“I mean, the girls might think 
a man gets rusty.” 

“I see what you mean.” Nestir 
blinked his eyes. “It wouldn’t be 
fair, all things considered.” 

He stood up. 

“I may tell you, my son, that, 
in thinking this matter over last 
night, I decided that Wanda — ah 
— Miller, yes, has had sufficient 
duty to merit participation in the 
Festival.” 

“Justice is a priestly virtue,” 
Harry said. 

“And you really think your 
wife would . .?” 

“Oh, yes, Father.” 

“Well, ahem. But . .” 

“Yes, Father?” 

“Ad dulce verboten.” 

“Uh?” 

“That is to say, in order for a 
woman to join in the ritual of the 
Changing of the Wives, she must, 
ahem, be married.” 

“I never thought of that,” said 
the third mate disconsolately. 

“I think that can be arranged, 
however,” said Nestir. “If you go 
by the mess hall on your way out, 
please tell the captain we can 
continue our discussion at his 
pleasure.” 

IV 

46CIT down, Captain,” said 
^ Nestir, when the captain 
entered. “No. Over there, in the 



172 



GALAXY 






comfortable chair. There. Are 
you comfortable, Captain?” 

“Of course I am.” 

“Good. I have a question to ask 
you, Captain.” 

“I say?” 

Nestir rubbed his bald head. 
“Sir,” he said by way of preamble, 

“I know you have the greatest 
sensibility in questions of duty.” 
“That’s quite so, y’know. I pride 
myself upon it, if I do say so.” 
“Exactly. Argot y calpex. No 
sacrifice is too great.” 

“True; true.” 

“Well, then, say the first day of 
Wenslaus, that would be — ah, a 
Zentahday — I may depend upon 
you to wed Wanda Miller, the 
bosun’s daughter, yes?” 

“No,” said the captain. 

“Come now, sir. I realize she is 
the daughter of a crewman, 
but—” 

“Father,” said the captain, “did 
I ever tell you about the time I 
led an expeditionary force against 
Zelthalta?” 

“I don’t believe you have.” 
“Then I will tell you. Came 
about this way. I was given com- 
mand of fifty-three thousand Ba- 
rains. Savage devils. Uncivilized, 
but fine fighters. I was to march 
them ninety-seven miles across 
the desert that ...” 

“Captain! I fear I must be very 
severe with you. I will be forced 
to announce in the mess hall this 
evening that you have refused to 



do your duty when it was plainly 
and properly called to your at- 
tention.” 

“Very well, Father,” the cap- 
tain said after several minutes. “I 
will do it.” 

He was trembling slightly. 

T HAT morning was to be the 
time of the captain’s wed- 
ding. He had insisted that it be 
done in privacy. For the cere- 
mony, he refused to make the 
slightest change in his everyday 
uniform; nor would he consent to 
Nestir’s suggestion that he carry 
a nosegay of hydroponic flowers. 
He had intended, after the cere- 
mony, to go about his duty as if 
nothing out of the ordinary had 
happened; but after it was done 
with, the vast indignity of it came 
home to him even more poig- 
nantly than he had imagined it 
would. 

Without a word, he left the 
priest’s stateroom and walked 
slowly, ponderously, with great 
dignity, to his own. 

It was a very fine stateroom. 
The finest, but for Nestir’s, in the 
whole ship. The velvet and gold 
drapes (his single esthetic joy) 
were scented with exotic perfume. 
The carpet was an inch and a half 
thick. 

He walked through his office 
without breaking his stride. 

The bed was large and fluffy. 
An unbroken expanse of white 



174 



GALAXY 



coverlette jutting out from the far 
bulkhead. It looked as soft as 
feather down. 

Without even a sigh, he threw 
himself upon the bed and lay 
very, very quiet. His left leg was 
suspended in the air, intersecting, 
at the thigh, the plane of the cov- 
erlet at forty-five degrees; the 
number of degrees remained 
stiffly, unrelaxingly forty-five. 

Only after a long, long time 
did he roll over on his back and 
then it was merely to stare fixedly 
at the ceiling. 

It is entirely possible that he 
would have lain there until 
Doomsday had not his introspec- 
tion been, around noon, inter- 
rupted by an apologetic tap on 
the door. 

“Come in,” he whispered, hop- 
ing she would not hear him and 
go away. 

But she heard him. 

“Husband,” Wanda said sim- 
ply. She closed the door behind 
her and stood staring at him. 

“Madam,” he said, “I hope you 
will have the kindness not to refer 
to me by that indecent appela- 
ticm a second time.” 

“Gee. You say the cutest things. 
I’m awful glad you had to marry 
me, huh.” 

The captain stood up, adjusted 
his coat and his shoulders, and 
walked across the room to the 
dressing table. He opened the 
left-hand drawer, removed a bot- 



tle, poured himself half a water- 
glass full and drank it off. 

“Ah,” he said. 

He returned to the bed and sat 
down. 

“Cantcha even say hello ta 
little ol’ me, huh?” she asked. 

“Hello,” he said. “Madam, sit 
down. I intend to give you an in- 
structive lecture in the natural 
order of . .” 

“Huh?” 

“Ah,” he said. “Quite true, of 
course.” 

She walked over to the chair 
and sat down. “I don’t like them,” 
she said. “Them cloth things over 
there.” 

“Those, Madam,” he said, “are 
priceless drapes I had imported 
from the province of San Xal- 
than. They have a long, strange 
history. 

“About three thousand years 
ago, a family by the name of 
Soong was forced to flee from the 
city of Xan because the eldest son 
of the family had become in- 
volved in a conspiracy against 
the illustrous King Fod. As the 
Soong family was traveling. .” 

“I don’t like ’em anyway,” said 
Wanda. 

“Madam,” said the captain, 
“kindly bring me that.” 

“This?” 

“Yes. Thank you.” 

He took the doll from her. He 
got up again, walked to the chest 
of drawers, searched around for a 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



175 



penknife. Finally he located it 
under a stack of socks. 

He returned to the bed. Sitting 
on the edge, he began to rip the 
doll along the seams with the pen- 
knife. Very carefully he emptied 
the sawdust out upon the carpet, 
and with equal deliberation, he 
cut up the canvas covering into 
small patches. Within fifteen 
minutes, for he worked very 
slowly, the doll was completely 
destroyed. 

He laid the penknife on the 
night stand by his bed. He took 
out a match and struck it across 
the bottom of his shoe; he bent 
over and ignited the remains of 
the doll. 

“You’ll burn yer rug,” Wanda 
said. 

“Yes,” the captain said, “I will. 
Be so kind as to close the door 
when you leave.” 

V 

T HE next day the captain ap- 
peared at mess. 

The third mate said, “I want to 
thank you for what you done for 
me, Captain.” 

“Don’t mention it,” the captain 
said, bisecting a pilchard with his 
fork. 

“It’s nice Wanda gets to be in 
the Festival,” Jane said. “It 
pleases my husband so.” 

“I’m very excited about it all,” 
the steward said. 



The first mate turned his egg 
over with his fork and peered sus- 
piciously at the underside of it. 
“Hit’s all right fur you uns ta feel 
excited. Martha an’ me are still 
purty bitter.” 

“Yes,” Martha said, “I don’t see 
why the children couldn’t take 
care of themselves.” 

“Who’d get the new crew out of 
ice?” John, the second mate, said. 

“That,” the first mate admitted, 
“is th’ problem. Can’tcha even 
cook an aig?” he asked the 
steward. 

“What’s the matter with the 
egg?” the third mate asked. 

“Hit hain’t cooked right,” the 
first mate insisted. 

“Helen,” the captain said, “may 
I see you after the meal?” 

Helen looked demurely into 
her plate. “Certainly, captain. But 
if it’s about the Changing of the 
Wives, I’ve already been asked 
for.” 

“And,” John said proudly, “I’ll 
bet she was one of the first ones 
asked.” 

“Nestir asked my wife almost a 
month ago,” said Harry. “She was 
the very first.” 

“Well,” the captain said, “that’s 
what I had in mind.” He turned 
to survey the table. His eyes lit 
upon Mary, the steward’s wife. 

She looked at him and shook 
her head. “John already asked 
me. 

“Well,” the captain said, “I 



176 



GALAXY 



must say, this is a very fine break- 
fast, steward. I dearly love pil- 
chards for breakfast. Convey my 
compliments to the cook.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

6 APT AIN,” said Nestir, “I 
^ was telling the men . .' . 
just before you came ... in about 
the great pageant of Koltah in the 
year of ’93. At the time, in a spe- 
cial celebration — annum mira- 
belei — we decided to observe the 
ancient customs of Meizque. The 
customs are of some interest, and 
I thought we might apply several 
of them to our own Festival.” 
“Whatever you wish,” said the 
captain tiredly, stirring his coffee. 

Before Nestir could resume his 
account, John interrupted. “I 
want to mention this again. I have 
a very special treatment for you, 
Captain. You should be encour- 
aged by that. No one will ever 
have a better Casting Off than 
you.” 

“Thank you,” said the captain. 
“I shall look forward to it.” He 
laid down his spoon. “Oh, Anne. 
May I see you?” 

“I’m sorry,” said the wife of 
Barney, the engineer. “Really and 
truly I am, but I’ve already been 
asked, too.” 

“Oh,” said the captain. 

He looked over at the last offi- 
cer’s wife, Leota. But he quickly 
looked away. 

“Well,” he said, “this is a fine 



breakfast we have this morning 
steward.” 

“Thank you, sir. I’ll tell the 
cook.” 

Jane said, in order to stave off 
the encroaching silence, “Nestir, 
how old are you?” 

“Going on forty — Jane.” 

“The prime of life,” the 
steward said. 

“Ah,” the captain said thought- 
fully. “Leota ...” 

She looked up and soundlessly 
her mouth formed the words, 
“Too late.” 

The captain dropped the spoon 
to his plate. 

Silence fell. It grew prolonged 
and uncomfortable. Finally the 
first mate said, “Hit hain’t the 
right way to cook aigs, damn 
hit.” 

The captain said, “Father, I 
say. All the officers’ wives have 
been asked.” 

“Yes,” said Nestir. “They have, 
haven’t they?” 

“Do you suppose it would be 
all right if I just . .” 

“You know the rules,” Nestir 
said sternly. 

“That’s what I was afraid you’d 
say,” said the captain. He looked 
up at the ceiling; his face was 
placid. He reached up with his 
right hand and began to scratch 
his chin. He scratched his chin 
for a long time, scarcely breath- 
ing.

werj silent, waiting for him to 
speak. 

UT BELIEVE I’ll have an- 
other cup of coffee,” he said 
at last. 

“Yes, sir,” said the steward, 
snapping his fingers for the 
waiter. 

Martha said: “You should have 
asked earlier.” 

“I know,” the captain said. 
“Father, I really don’t see why I 
have to Change Wives.” 

“But Harry will have yours 
that day. And you know the 
rules.” 

“There are a lot of good-look- 
ing women in the crew,” the 
steward said. 

“Quite a number,” said the cap- 
tain. 

He arose from the table and 
steadied himself a moment. 
“Never mind the coffee,” he said. 
“I shouldn’t drink over one cup 
for breakfast. I believe it aggra- 
vates my scrofula.” 

He turned., arid walked out of 
the mess hall. 

He walked very straight and 
tall. He walked down the crew’s 
corridor toward their quarters. 

Shortly he saw a woman com- 
ing out of one of the cabins. 

“Madam,” he said. 

She came over to him. “Yes, 
sir?” 

“Madam,” he said, “Madam, 

I . .” 



“Would ja like to have a drink 
of water? It’s right down this way, 
an’ then ya turn ta the left.” 

“No . uh. I . Madam, would 
you honor me by becoming my 
partner for the night of the 
Changing of the Wives?” 

She balanced on the balls of 
her feet and looked up at him. 
“Yur th’ captain, ain’tcha?” 

“Yes,” he said. “I am.” 

“Sure, I’ll do hit,” she said. “I’d 
be mighty proud ta.” 

The captain turned away and 
then turned back. “Madam,” he 
said, “what is your name?” 

“Joanne Marie. Jest ask for me. 
Everybody down here knows 
me. 

“Joanne Marie, Joanne Marie,” 
he repeated under his breath. He 
shuddered and turned to go. 

VI 

T HE day of the Changing of the 
Wives came to the ship. It 
was a very important ritualistic 
day, held, always, three weeks and 
one day before the Festival of the 
Casting Off. 

The morning of the day, Nestir 
spoke to the assembled comple- 
ment. He explained its symbolic 
importance: he explained its his- 
toric development; he delivered, 
in cretia ultimatum est, an exege- 
sis on the Jarcon. And then he 
took off the cloak of priestcraft 
and cast it to the floor. “For I 



178 



GALAXY 



am,” he said, “Ah, a man as you 
are men.” 

Then, being no longer em- 
powered to pronounce a benedic- 
tion (under normal conditions, 
the function of a younger priest), 
he left the cheering members of 
Flight Seventeen A and sped 
directly to his stateroom. 

The afternoon passed unevent- 
fully. The complement of the ship 
moved about their routine chores 
tingling in anticipation of the 
evening. 

At the evening meal, a new 
seating arrangement was insti- 
tuted at the insistence of the 
I steward and the third mate. The 
newly formed couples were to sit 
side by side. 

To accomplish this, it was nec- 
| essary to set two extra plates in 
the officers’ mess. One, for 
Wanda, next to the third mate; 
and one, for Joanne Marie, be- 
side the captain. 

“Please pass the meat,” the 
third mate said. 

Nestir handed it across to him. 

‘“Thank you, Father.” 

“Today, in culpa res, I no 
longer have that honor,” Nestir 
| reminded him. “The blood-red 
| cloak of priestcraft will never 
again touch my shoulders this side 
[ of the Reward.” 

“I’d be a little sad,” said the 
steward. 

“Oh, I don’t know,” the third 
mate said.

“It probably all depends,” 
Helen, the wife of the second 
mate, agreed. 

“Hit’s a far, far better thing I 
do,” the first mate said sonor- 
ously. He was a little drunk. 

The captain speared one pea 
and ate it. “I envy you,” he said, 
looking over at Joanne Marie. 

Wanda Miller, who had al- 
ready upset her glass of water in 
the third mate’s lap, said, “Pass 
the biscuits, hey . .You uns have 
better’n we do.” 

“No,” said the steward, “not at 
all, my dear. We eat the same as 
the crew.” 

“Yes; precisely so,” the third 
mate said. 

“Except ours is fixed up a little 
differently,” said Jane. 

“An’ our cook can’t fry an aig,” 
the first mate said. 

“I wouldn’t say that,” said the 
captain. 

“Shucks,” Joanne Marie said, 
“anybody can fry an aig.” 

“On the contrary, Madam. I 
recall once, when I was a political 
adviser for the Kong regime . .” 

“Do you mean mea-Kong?” the 
steward asked. 

“No, that was in Koltah.” 

“Yes,” Nestir said. “I am very 
familiar with them. They . .” 

“That’s not the one I meant,” 
the captain snapped. 

Nestir leaped to his feet. 
“Well!” he said loudly. “I’m 
through eating.”

“Oh, come now, old man. 
There’s no hurry, really, y’know,” 
the captain insisted gently. 

“Ain’t there?” Joanne Marie 
asked. “Gee. I can see you sure 
ain’t like my husband. I mean my 
ex.” She giggled. 

“Well, I guess I’m finished, too,” 
Jane said. “Well. Good night, 
Harry.” 

“Good night, dear.” 

I N the mess hall, the lights were 
out. The figure of the captain 
loomed like a stark obelisk in the 
gloom. 

“Captain, sir, we uns uv been 
sittin’ here at this table fur hours 
an’ hours. I’m gettin’ purty tired 
us sittin’.” 

“It’s not long until the Festi- 
val,” he said. 

“When the mess boy cleared 
away all them dishes, I thought 
shore you’d leave, then.” 

“Oh, no,” said the captain. 
“This is very exciting.” 

“It ain’t, the way I see it,” 
Joanne Marie said. 

“Different perspective, Madam. 
Doubtless you would not have 
considered it very exciting either, 
the time I ran a wagon train from 
Tamask-Cha. You see, the mate- 
rial was to be delivered on a min- 
ing contract. Madam, I can assure 
you it was hot. The only road was 
a narrow line across the Ubiq 
desert. And late the first even- 
mg . 



“I can see it warn’t very excit- 
ing,” Joanne Marie said. 

Silence returned. 

“I am getting sleepy,” the cap- 
tain said at length. 

“Oh, I’m usually awake this 
late. Shucks, I’m used to it. 
Sometimes I jest get ta sleep 
when it’s time ta get up. But I 
do wish we’d go to bed.” 

“Madam, your language!” 

“All I said was . .” 

“I know; I know,” the captain 
said. “Madam, come to my state- 
room. You may sleep on the sofa.” 
“Weeeel,” Joanne Marie said, 
“I ain’t a-sayin’ that. I know my 
rights.” 

“Let us not be difficult. I am 
certain, when I explain to you in 
a logical fashion the obvious im- 
possibility of — of — ” 

“You got no wife?” 

“No,” he said. 

“Yeah. I thought not. That sure 
is swell.” 

“Madam. Perhaps I can say it 
this way. I have certain perturba- 
tions, but I can assure you, what- 
ever you attempt my aim is in- 
flexible. For me, the Captain, to — 
ah — consort with a crew woman 
is preposterous.” 

“Is that what you call it? Now 
that’s a funny word. My husband 
calls it — ” 

“Madam!” 

Joanne Marie was cowed into 
silence. They walked directly to 
his stateroom.

Once inside, Joanne Marie said, 
“Now ya jest sit down, comfort- 
able like. I got somethin’ I want 
to tell ya.” 

“No,” the captain said. 

“I ain’t even told ja yet.” 

“It won’t matter,” the captain 
said. 

“My husband don’t like me,” 
she said. 

He dropped his head into his 
hands and sighed deeply. Then he 
looked up, his face set in icy 
resignation. 

VII 

J OHN, the second mate, awoke 
early the morning of the 
Festival. 

“Helen, honey,” he said. “Wake 
up.” 

She murmured sleepily. 

“Come on, now, wake up.” 

She rolled over to her side of 
the bed. 

“All right,” he said. He reached 
out, fumbled for and found his 
cigarettes. 

“You know what I’m going to 
do to the captain?” he asked. He 
lit a cigarette and lying on his 
back blew smoke rings at the 
ceiling. 

“Yes,” his wife said, “you told 
me. 

“First, I’m going to take that 
saber I got on Queglat and scrape 
open his scrofula. Then, when he’s 
bleeding nicely, all I have to do is 



pour a bottle of alcohol on him. 
Don’t you think that will be 
nice?” 

“Yes, dear.” 

“You know, I’m kinda sorry I 
went to all the trouble sharpen- 
ing that saber. After all, it might 
be more painful if the saber was 
dull.” 

“Yes, dear.” 

“But then, on the other 
hand ...” 

“Dear, will you hand me a ciga- 
rette?” 

“Sure.” 

He shook out a cigarette, lit it 
off his and handed it to her. 

“So what do you think?” 

“It doesn’t matter, dear,” she 
said. 

“Oh, but it does matter,” John 
insisted. “I think it’s very impor- 
tant.” He snubbed out his ciga- 
rette. “It’s all the little details that 
one should take into account. 
Can’t be too careful about some- 
thing like that.” 

He rolled over on his back 
again. “I’m hungry,” he said. 

“I really thought they should 
have served breakfast,” Helen 
said. 

“Well, it wouldn’t be right to 
leave all those dirty dishes for 
the second crew.” 

“I mean just sandwiches.” 

“Yes,” he said, “they could 
have made up some sandwiches. 
I think, though, I’d settle for a 
cup of tea.” 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



181 






“I could brew you some on the 
hot plate.” 

“It’s too much bother,” John 
said. “Are you sure you wouldn’t 
mind?” 

“No. If you’ll get up and put 
the water on.” 

“All right,” he said. 

He threw his legs over the side, 
fumbled with his feet for the 
house slippers, padded to the hot 
plate, put the water on, and came 
back to bed. 

“We’ve still got an hour before 
the bell,” he said. 

“Are you going to shave?” 

“I don’t think so; not today,” 
he said. 

“By the way, honey; what’s in 
that can over there?” 

“Fuel oil,” she said. 

“What’s it for?” 

“You’d be surprised,” she said. 

After a while, the water began 
to sizzle against the sides of the 
pan. 

“Time to get up,” she said. 
She crawled over her husband, 
slipped into a robe, and pro- 
ceeded to brew the tea. 

“It’s not much of a breakfast, 
John.” 

“Say,” he said, “where’s my 
bottle of alcohol for the captain.” 

“I set it over by the medicine 
cabinet, out of the way.” 

“I wonder if it’ll be enough?” 
he mused. 

“I hope so,” she said. “Are you 
going to get up, or must I serve 



you this tea in bed? I will if you 
want me to.” 

“I’ll get up,” he said. He got up. 
“Let’s take it in the nook to 
drink,” he said. 

“Can’t.” 

“Oh? Why not?” 

“One of the legs is off the 
table.” 

“If you’d told me, I’d fixed it.” 
“Never mind,” she said. 

T HEY each drank two cups of 
tea; and then each dressed 
for the Festival. 

After that, they sat in silence, 
awaiting the bell to signal the 
start of the Festival. 

“I’m going to hurry out,” John 
said at length, “as soon as the bell 
rings, so I can stand outside the 
captain’s door and get him when 
he comes out.” 

“That’s not fair, John,” she said. 
“You’re supposed to wait for the 
second bell before you can even 
start to Cast anyone Off.” 

“I know,” said John, “but this 
way, I’ll be sure to get the cap- 
tain.” 

“Well,” she said, “I’m certainly 
glad you have that attitude.” 

He asked, after more silence, 
“What are you going to do?” 

“I think I’ll stay here for a little 
while,” she said. 

“Yes, that might — ” 

The bell rang soundingly 
throughout the ship. 

“Time to go,” John said. He 

GALAXY 



182 



- 



grabbed his saber. “Where’s the 
alcohol?” 

“In there,” she said. 

He skidded into the bathroom, 
pocketed the alcohol, and started 
for the door. 

“John!” 

“Huh?” 

“Aren’t you even going to kiss 
me good-by?” 

“Oh, sure. Forgot.” He crossed 
to her, bent down and kissed her. 
She put her left arm around his 
neck. With her right hand, she 
located the table leg she had 
placed behind her pillow. 

John drew away and half 
turned. “Good — ” 

She hit him in the left temple 
with the table leg. He went down 
like a poleaxed steer. 

She laughed happily. 

VIII 

TJF/'HEN the bell sounded for 
™ the people to separate, 
preparatory to the hunt proper, 
the captain got up and buckled on 
his huge infantry sword. He had 
spent most of the night sharpen- 
ing it. 

He had after long hours of con- 
sidering, decided that there was 
only one honorable course left to 
him. He would defend himself. 

For if he were the Sole Survi- 
vor of the hunt, he would be Cast 
Off properly by the first mate. 
Otherwise . 



The possibility that it might be 
done by a crewman was stagger- 
ingly humiliating. He would sal- 
vage his honor from that final in- 
dignity at all costs. 

Of course, if he were captured 
by an officer, it would be a differ- 
ent matter entirely; he would sur- 
render and submit like the gentle- 
man he was. But a crewman . 

He took the sword out of the 
scabbard and rubbed his thumb 
along the side of it. 

He swung it, and it whistled in 
the air crisply, pleasingly. 

He grasped it firmly in his right 
hand and walked to the door. He 
threw open the door and jumped 
back and away. 

But it was safe; there was no 
one outside. 

He stepped into the corridor. 

Empty. 

He looked both ways. He lis- 
tened. 

Then he began to run, swiftly, 
silently, on his toes. 

At the first intersection, he 
stopped and surveyed the crossing 
corridor. 

To his left, almost at the far 
bend, he saw a crewman; how- 
ever, the man was not looking in 
his direction, and the captain felt 
that he could be reasonably safe 
from detection if he crossed 
quickly enough. He sprinted 
across the open space. 

On the other side, he stopped 
and waited. After several minutes 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



183 



of silence, he knew that he could 
safely continue. 

He ran for a long distance. 

Finally, safely down in the 
second level, he slowed to a walk. 
He was breathing heavily; it was 
very loud, and his footsteps 
echoed hollowly. 

He was alone down there. He 
could tell that. 

At the Jonson bend, he 
breathed a sigh of relief. Ahead 
was the empty corridor that led 
to the dead end, Forward. He 
could see down it, clear to the 
bulkhead. And as he knew it 
would be, it was devoid of life 
and movement. 

He sat down to wait out the 
long day. 

He scratched his chin. 

He would have nothing to do 
until the closing bell. At which 
time he would be forced to go to 
the assembly area. 

As would anyone else, accord- 
ing to the rules of the Festival as 
laid down by Nestir, who had not 
yet been sent to his Reward. 

That would be a dangerous 
time. For then there would be no 
esthetic consideration. It would 
be a fight amongst all assembling 
for the final honor of Sole Survi- 
vor. One could expect no mercy: 
clean, quick sword stroke, no 
more. No suffering at all. 

It was not a pleasant prospect. 
But to be the coveted Sole Survi- 
vor compensated for the risk. 



The captain laid the sword 
across his lap and petted it. 

He would fight. And no crew 
member need expect to be the 
man Cast Off by the first mate; 
that was to be the captain’s fate. 

The second bell called to the 
ship shrilly. 

The hunt was on! 

M ARTHA and the first mate 
assembled the children in 
the large, comfortable hospital. 
The steward’s department had 
fixed them all a lunch. The chil- 
dren were silent, for the angry 
brow of the first mate was a com- 
plete damper on their usual ani- 
mal spirits. There was no holiday 
happiness. 

The children moved around 
and fell into little, shifting groups. 
Several of them began to game at 
marbles, but the first mate broke 
it up before it degenerated into 
a fist fight. 

“Well, there goes the hunting 
bell,” Martha said. 

“Yes,” the mate said, “hit do, 
don’t hit.” 

“I think they could have a reg- 
ular nurse for this sort of thing," 
Martha said. 

The mate grunted. “Humph. I 
shore hope they uns don’t raise 
no ruckus. I’ve got me a splittin’ 
haidache.” 

“Shhhh. Listen. I thought I 
heard someone scream.” 

“Yep,” the mate said. “I was 



184 



GALAXY 



sure afraid uv hit; won’t be able 
to heyar myself think all day 
long. I’m a-tellin’ ya, Martha, if 
these young uns start a-actin’ up, 
too, I’m jest a-gonna take a knife 
an’ split this here haid open, Re- 
ward or no Reward.” 

“That’s not a nice way to talk,” 
Martha said. 

“No, hit hain’t. But I’m a-sayin’ 
hit.” 

“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” 
Martha said. “I’ll call all the chil- 
dren together and tell them nur- 
sery stories. That oughta keep 
them quiet. And you go over there 
and lay down where there won’t 
be anyone to bother you.” 

“All right, Martha, an’ I shore 
do thankee.” 

The first mate made his way to 
the farthest bed, sat down, took 
off his shoes, and stretched out on 
it. He reached up and felt his 
head tenderly. 

“Children,” Martha called. “Oh, 
children! I want you all to come 
over here.” 

Reluctantly, the children 
obeyed her. 

“That’s right,” she said. “Now. 
You all sit down and make your- 
selves comfortable, and be still 
as mice so my husband can sleep, 
and I’ll tell you stories. And then, 
after a while, we’ll eat the nice 
lunch the steward fixed for us, and 
we’ll all have the bestest time.” 

“I don’t like you,” one of the 
little boys said. 



“Little boy,” Martha said, “I 
don’t like you, either.” 

“Oh,” the little boy said. 
“Now,” Martha said, “I’m going 
to tell you the wonderful story 
about a very pretty Princess and 
a very pretty Prince: Once upon a 
time, there was a land called 
Zont. It sank long ago under the 
big, salty sea of Zub . .” 

“My name’s Joey,” the little 
boy said. 

“Well, Joey,” Martha said, “do 
you see that long, steel rod over 
there, where we hang clothing 
from?” 

“Uh-huh.” 

“If you don’t shut your little 
mouth, I’ll hang you on it by your 
thumbs.” ' 

“Betcha ya won’t,” one of the 
little girls said. 

iC/'ANCE upon a time,” Martha 
said, “there was this hand- 
some Prince and pretty Princess. 
But the father of the Princess, 
King Exaltanta, was a heathen 
and did not believe in the Pro- 
phet. Now. When a true believer, 
kind King Farko, captured King 
Exaltanta’s kingdom, the deposed 
king hid his daughter in the deep- 
est dungeon. 

“Now when the fair Prince, who 
was the son of King Farko, and 
whose name was William, heard 
of the Princess in the dungeon, he 
decided that he would rescue her 
and marry her. And after she had 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



185 



had one child by him, the two of 
them would travel to the Holy 
City of Meizque to participate in 
the Changing of the Wives and 
the Festival there. 

“Well, it so happened that King 
Farko got a special dispensation 
from the Great Priest to send the 
members of Exaltanta’s family to 
their Reward without their con- 
sent. As he prepared the cere- 
monies — they were to be very 
simple: for, after all, the royal 
household members weren’t true 
believers, and would consequent- 
ly need to spend a million years 
(at least) as Outcasts before en- 
tering into their Reward, anyhow 
— as he prepared the cere- 
monies . 

“But does everyone get a Re- 
ward? Even people who don’t be- 
lieve?” a little girl asked, wide 
eyed. 

“Nearly everyone, my child. 
The Prophet was not a cruel man. 
Of course, people who try to Cast 
themselves Off never, never, nev- 
er get a Reward. But others, 
everybody else, all get theirs. It’s 
only a question of how long they 
have to wait. Sometimes, as when 
they’re unbelievers, it may be a 
long, long, long time, but . .” 

“I know that,” Joey said. 

Martha looked up at him and 
sighed; she stood up. “Come with 
me, dear,” she said. 

At that moment, the door flew 
open with a loud bang. 



The first mate, who had been 
asleep, sat bolt upright on the 
bed. “God damn hit!” he 
screamed. “My haid!” 

“Oh,” said a crew member, who 
was dragging a woman by the 
hair, “I’m terribly sorry. I didn’t 
know you were in here. I just 
came in to Cast Mary Jane Off in 
privacy.” He waved an odd-look- 
ing instrument at Martha by way 
of amplification. 

“Hello, mummy,” one of the 
smaller girls said to the woman. 

“Oh, why, hello, honey. Are you 
having fun?” 

“Oh, yes, mummy.” 

Mary Jane looked at the crew- 
man. “Well, Bob,” she said, “I' 
guess we’ll just have to go some 
place else.” 

“Well, git hout er come in, but 
shut that door! That noise out 
there is a-tearin’ off my haid!” 

The crewman called Bob 
dragged the woman called Mary 
Jane out of the room. She pulled 
the door closed behind her. 

“Well, children,” Martha said, 
“we ought to get back to my 
story. Now, King Farko, as you 
will remember, received a special 
dispensation . .” 

TVTESTIR locked his door when 
-L ’ the separation bell sounded. 

Having done that, he pro- 
ceeded to fix himself a meal. It 
was a simple one, consisting only 
of what material he had been able 



186 



GALAXY 



to steal from the steward’s depart- 
ment the previous night. 

As he ate, he reflected upon his 
course of action. It was, he could 
see, going to be difficult to justify 
at the Reward. But he had been a 
priest, and because of that he was 
reasonably well grounded in theo- 
logical dialectics. 

The Festival, of course, was a 
fine thing. But it had its weak 
points. Chief among them being 
that the Casting Off was left to in- 
experienced hands, and certainly, 
if there was ever a time when ex- 
perience was required, then the 
Casting Off was that time. One 
should be Cast Off at leisure; suf- 
fering long and deliciously. A 
state hero, for instance, honored 
by being Cast Off by one of the 
King’s Guards, certainly died the 
best death imaginable. 

In the present case, although 
the death as Sole Survivor was to 
come at the hands of the first 
mate (who really lacked the 
training for such a position of 
trust), it would be the best Cast- 
ing Off available. For the first 
mate could follow instructions, 
and Nestir had written the in- 
structions. "i 

Nestir intended to remain in 
the stateroom all day; the hunt 
would go merrily along without 
him. 

When the assembly bell rang, 
he would still remain in his state- 
room. 



Then, late at night, he would 
leave. He would slip down to the 
first mate’s stateroom and deter- 
mine from him where the prema- 
ture Sole Survivor slept. Then 
he would find him and Cast him 
Off in his sleep. And Nestir would 
be the actual Sole Survivor. 

Nestir could justify his conduct 
by virtue of the little known theo- 
logical clause: ego bestum alpha 
todas. A decision handed down by 
the High Court of the Prophet 
(Malin vs the Estate of Kattoa: 
T & C, ’98) nearly a hundred 
years previously. 

Nestir had, in his hip pocket, a 
small vial of slow-acting poison. 
He would drink it just before 
Casting the man Off. Then were 
he not handled the next day by 
the first mate, he would die the 
Outcast death, by his own hand. 

He did not doubt his ability to 
convince Them at the Reward. 
It would be difficult, but it was 
not beyond his ability. Certainly, 
if no one took the opportunity of 
Casting him Off as he sat behind 
the locked door of his room, it 
wasn’t Nestir’s fault. 

The bosun pushed the ventila- 
tor grill away and jumped out of 
the shaft even before it hit the 
carpet. 

He landed catlike, his knees 
bending springily to absorb the 
shock. He landed directly behind 
Nestir and pushed the little man 
against the wall. 



VOYAGE TO FAR N'JURD 



187 



Nestir struggled out of the 
wreckage of the chair. 

“How . why . why . ?” he 
said 

“Ah-ha,” the bosun said. 
“Fooled ja, didn’t I?” 

The bosun was carrying a thin 
rapier. 

“Let’s discuss this,” Nestir said. 
“One must go about these things 
slowly.” 

“Sorry,” the bosun said. 

“My God,” said Nestir, “you 
can't Cast me Off just like that: 
without any suffering!” 

“Sorry,” the bosun said. “Don’t 
have all day. Spend all day with 
you, and then what? The more 
people I can Cast Off before the 
assembly bell, the better chance 
I’ll have to be the Sole Survivor.” 
“Have you no compassion, 
man? Can you turn aside from the 
course of the gentle Prophet?” 
“Sorry,” the bosun said again, 
sincerely. “I can’t stand here all 
day discussing it.” 

“Ah, me,” said Nestir as the 
bosun drew back from the 
thrust, “who would have thought 
that I would be trapped by a 
religious fanatic?” 

“Must look out for myself, you 
know,” said the bosun. 

IX 

H ELEN said, “I thought maybe 
I hit you too hard.” 

“No,” John said. “Fortunately 



not.” He had just opened his eyes. 

He was strapped tightly to the 
bed. “I appreciate what you’re 
doing,” he said. “I know you want 
to be sure I’m Cast Off right. But 
honey, do you think it was fair 
to jump the bell on me like that?” 
“Well,” she said, “that’s what 
you intended to do to the cap- 
tain.” 

He grinned ruefully. “Darn it. I 
did look forward to Casting him 
Off.” 

“Oh, well,” his wife said, “I 
guess we can’t have everything.” 
“True, my dear,” said John. “It 
was very thoughtful of you.” 

“I wanted to be sure that my 
husband had the best.” 

“I know you did.” 

“Well,” she'said. “I guess I may 
as well begin.” 

“Yes,” he said. 

“Have you any suggestions, 
honey?” 

“No,” he said. “I’ll leave it all 
up to you.” 

“All right.” She walked to the 
dresser and picked up a pair of 
pliers. She crossed to him. 

She had already removed his 
shoes while he was unconscious. 

“I think,” she said, “I’ll take the 
big toe first.” 

“Whatever you like, my dear.” 
After a moment, she said, “My, 
I didn’t know it was going to be 
so hard to pull a few little old 
toenails.” 

After she had finished with his 



188 



GALAXY 



left foot, she poured alcohol over 
it. 

Then she had to wait for him 
to regain consciousness. 

“Honey?” she asked. 

“Yes?” 

“You didn’t scream very 
much.” 

“That’s all right,” he said. 
“You’re doing fine.” 

“All right,” she said. “If you’re 
satisfied. I guess I may as well 
start on the other foot . Oh, 
John?” 

“Yes, dear?” 

“Would you like for me to fix 
you a cup of tea before we go on?” 
“I don’t think so. But it’s a nice 
thought.” 

“Honey?” 

“Yes?” 

“You asked what that fuel oil 
was for, remember?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, when I finish this,” she 
said, “I’m going to pour it over 
you and light it.” 

“Helen,” he said, “I married one 
of the . cleverest . women . 
in the . system.” 

“There,” she said, “I thought I’d 
never get that one.” 

HPHE captain got very cramped, 
■*- sitting there. It was late. He 
expected it was about time for 
the assembly bell to ring. 

He stood up. 

No one had come down his cor- 
ridor all day, and he felt very 



pleased with his acumen in select- 
ing it. 

There wasn’t nearly as much 
noise as there had been earlier; 
people were thinning out. He 
hoped there wouldn’t be many 
left in the fight for the assembly. 

He heard, interrupting his rev- 
erie, a thin, shrill shriek, drifting 
down the corridor from his left. 
Then, looking, he saw a crewman 
running toward him. 

He tightened his grip on his in- 
fantry sword. 

Then he relaxed. It was all 
right. 

The man had no arms. 

The crewman came to a stop 
in front of him. 

“Oh? Captain. Good afternoon, 
sir.” 

“Good afternoon. Careful there. 
You’ll get blood on my uniform.” 

“Sorry, sir.” 

“How are things going, back 
there?” 

“Pretty slow . last . couple 
hours.” 

“Getting pretty weak, eh?” 

“Yes, sir. Mind if ... I ... sit 
down?” 

“Not at all. Make yourself at 
home.” 

“Thank . you, sir.” He sat 
down. “My,” he said, “I’m tired.” 

“Loss of blood, probably. Lis- 
ten, old fellow. Do you think 
you’ve about quit suffering, 
now?” 

“Oh, yes,” the crewman said.

“Scarcely feel ... a thing any 
more. Numb.” 

“Well, in that case, no sense in 
keeping you from your Reward.” 

“Not ... a bit.” 

The captain drew back his 
huge sword. 

“See . you . around,” the 
crewman said. 

The sword whistled down. 

The captain wiped the sword 
on the crewman’s blouse. His legs 
were still stiff. He needed a little 
exercise. He began to walk to- 
ward the dead end of the corri- 
dor, keeping a weather eye be- 
hind him. 

“. Bombs away!” 

The crewman hurtled onto his 
shoulders from the steampipe 
above. 

The captain fell flat, and his 
sword went skittering away, rat- 
tling loudly on the steel deck. 

“Umph!” he said. 

“Boy!” the crewman said, “I 
shore thought you’d never come 
back down here.” 

The captain was stunned. He 
could feel the crewman lashing 
his hands together behind him. 

“What were you doing up 
there?” the captain said at length. 

“I dumb up there when I a- 
hyeared ya a-comin’ like a herd 
o’ elephants. I thought ta come 
down here an’ wait hit out ’til th’ 
assembly bell.” 

“My intentions exactly,” the 
captain said, testing his bonds. 



There was no escape from them. 

“Your voice sounds familiar.” 

“Yeah. Hit should. I’m Hender- 
son, th’ officers’ messman.” 

“Lord give me strength,” the 
captain said. 

“Now, iffen you’ll jest roll over 
on yer back, Captain.” 

“What for, my boy?” 

“I kinda thought that first off 
I’d like ta pour this little bottle of 
hydrofluoric acid on ya.” 

“That’s very clever,” the cap- 
tain said. Then he reconsidered. 

“For a crewman, that is.”

r T , HE first mate looked over at 
-®- the bosun. 

“Uncomfortable?” ( 

“Yes,” the bosun said. 

“Fine, I thought you’d be.” He 
took out his penknife and began > 

to whittle on a piece of wood. 

After a while he said, “You 
haint mindin’ me puttin’ hit off , 

this away?” 

“No,” the bosun said, “suit ’ 

yourself.” 

The first mate sent a shaving 
skittering with his knife blade. 
“Shucks,” he said, “there hain’t 
really no hurry.” 

The bosun raised his head from 
his chest and shook the hair out B 

of his face. “Not really, when you 
consider it,” he said. » 

“Yep, that’s right.” The first a 

mate began to work on the point

of the stick; he sharpened it down 
to needle fineness, and then he 
carefully cut in the barb. “Hain’t 
very strong wood; them barbs are 
cut against the grain, an’ they’re 
liable ta split off when I try ta 
pull ’em out.” 

“I hope not,” the bosun said. 

The first mate said, “Yep, I’m 
shore afraid they’re a-gonna do 
jest that little trick.” 

“Look,” said the bosun, “this 
hair’s gettin’ in my eyes. I wunder 
if you’d mind kinda snippin’ it 
off?” 

“Not a-tall,” the first mate said. 

He walked over to the bosun, 
grabbed a handful of hair and 
sawed it off with the penknife. 

“That better?” 

“It shore is. Thanks.” 

“Not a-tall.” 

The first mate threw down the 
stick on the table. “Really should 
uv cut that before.” 

“I suppose so,” the bosun said. 

“ ’Course I warn’t hable to see 
what uz in th’ priest’s mind.” 

“No, that’s true,” the bosun 
agreed. 

The first mate walked over and 
picked up the typewritten instruc- 
tions. 

“You’re a-gonna get a fine 
Castin’ Off,” he said. 

“I should,” the bosun said. “It 
ain’t everybody can be th’ Sole 
Survivor.” 

“That’s true,” the first mate 
said. “Well,” he said after a min- 



ute, “I jest guess I know them 
there instructions fine as any- 
thing. I suspect we may as well 
start, iffen hits agreeable ta you.” 

“I’m ready,” the bosun said. 

The first mate took his pen- 
knife and tested the edge with 
his thumb. “Shore is sharp,” he 
said. “Ought ta be. I jest got 
done a-honin’ hit.” 

TTE walked over to where the 
bosun was hanging. 

“Well,” he said. “No time like 
the present.” 

He raised the knife. 

“Jest a minute,” he said. “I 
think I’ll get me some music on 
the radio. You don’t mind?” 

“No,” said the bosun. “Not a 
bit.” 

The first mate walked to the 
hyperspace radio and flicked on 
the dial. After fiddling with it for 
some time, he picked up a sym- 
phony being broadcast from 
Kque. “There,” he said, “that’s th’ 
kind uv music I shore do like ta 
hear.” 

The music welled out and filled 
the room with sound. 

“Shore is purty,” the bosun 
said. 

The first mate walked back to 
him. 

“Guess I’ll start on your back,” 
he said. He reached up and 
ripped the bosun’s shirt off. 

Then, when the back was laid 
bare, he made a very shallow cut

running the length of the shoul- 
ders from armpit to armpit. 

“Be kinda hard ta get started,” 
he said. 

He put the penknife in the in- 
cision and began to pry the skin 
loose. “Gonna take me a long time 
ta get a hand holt,” he said. 
“ ’Course onct I do, hit’ll be as 
easy as skinnin’ a skunk.” 

“Take yer time,” the bosun 
said. 

“Aim to.” 

The music turned quiet and 
sounded of the rippling brooks on 
far Corazon; it reflected the vast 
meadows of Nid and the giant, 
silver-capped mountains of Muri. 
A cello picked up the theme and 
ran it, in rich notes, over the 
whole surface of the dead world, 
Astolath. A whining oboe piped of 
the sweet winds from Zoltah; and 
the brass beat out the finny 
rhythm of the water world of Du. 

“ ’Scuse me,” the first mate said. 
He laid down the penknife and 
walked to the radio. With a flick 
of his wrist, he cut it off. 

“What uz th’ matter with hit?” 
the bosun asked. 

“Didn’t ja notice?” said the 
first mate. “Th’ third fiddle was 
sour.” 

“Guess I wasn’t listenin’ close 
enough,” said the bosun. 

The first mate returned to his 
work. “May as well get on with 
it,” he said. 

He raised the penknife again. 



1Y/TARTHA threw the door open. 
1YX “Here!” she said. She swung 
Joey around in front of her by the 
left ear. “I’m going to have to 
leave him in here with you, where 
he won’t get into trouble.” 

The first mate laid aside the 
penknife. 

“Martha,” he said, “I jest plain 
don’t like kids.” 

“I’m sorry,” she said, “But I 
just can’t keep him with the rest 
of the children. I just can’t.” 
“Whatud he do?” the bosun 
asked. 

“Do? Let me tell you,” Martha 
said. “First, he ... ” 

“I didn’t,” Joey said. 

“I haint got no all day ta listen 
ta ya, woman,” the first mate said. 

“Well. The worst of it was with 
little Jane. Do you know what he 
tried to do to her?” 

“No, and I shore don’t care,” 
said the first mate testily: 

“Well, first he got her down un- 
der the table; and then he sat on 
her; and if I hadn’t stopped him, 
he would have pounded her 
brains out against the deck.” 

“My, my,” said the bosun. 
“That hain’t a-tall nice.” 
“Grownups do it,” Joey said. 
“That’s entirely different,” the 
bosun said. 

“No, it ain’t. You just don’t like 
me, that’s all.” 

“Little Jane wasn’t ready,” 
Martha said. “She hasn’t had a 
chance to do her duty.”

“It don’t matter,” Joey said. 

“Little boy,” said the bosun, “do 
you know where people go who 
talk that way?” 

“I don’t care,” Joey said. 

“You see? I’ll simply have to 
leave him in here with you.” 

“All right,” the first mate 

agreed reluctantly. “Now, little 

boy,” he said, “you hain’t a-gonna 
bother me, hear? I’m very busy. 
You jest go over there and 

watch.” 

“Yes,” said the bosun. 

Martha said, “Well, I better 
get back to the other children.” 

She left and the first mate 

turned back to his job. 

“What’s he crying for?” Joey 
asked. 

“ ’Cause it hurts,” the first mate 
explained. 

“You missed somethin’ there in 
th’ back,” Joey said. 

“Why did you try to choke that 
little girl?” the mate asked. 

“ ’Cause I wanted to.” 

“Well,” the first mate said, 
“that’s why I left that little patch 
o’ skin.” 

“Oh,” said Joey. 

He stood up and walked 
around the bosun. 

“What’re ya gonna do next?” 
he asked. 

“Be still,” said the bosun. 

“I bet I know,” Joey said. “I’ll 
bet you’re gonna take that little 
stick over there an’ stick it in 
him.” 



“That shore ... is right,” the 
bosun said proudly. 

“Can I, huh?” 

“No,” the first mate said. 

“Why not? All ya gotta do 
is . .” He picked up the stick and 
lunged at the bosun. 

r T'HE first mate tripped him and 
took the stick away from 

him. 

“Let him alone,” the bosun said 
to Joey. “He’s doin’ jest fine.” 

“Thankee,” said the first mate. 

Martha came back. 

“Is he bothering you? We could 
put him in the ice with the new 
crew,” she said. 

“Fine,” the first mate said. 

“Oh, no,” Joey said. “You gotta 
catch me first.” He began to back 
away from Martha. 

She took a step toward him. 

He turned and started to run. 

“Thought so,” she said. She had 
been holding one hand behind 
her. It contained a plastic ash- 
tray. She caught him squarely be- 
tween the ears with it, and he 
went down. 

“Good heave, Martha!” the 
first mate said. 

She walked over to Joey, 
picked him up and started to the 
door. 

At the door she paused. 

“What did you say you wanted 
for supper, Fontelroy?” 

_ “Two aigs,” he said.
