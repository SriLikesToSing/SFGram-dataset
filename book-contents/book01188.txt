EDITORIAL 



AD ASTRA PER . 

America’s Defense Budget has come to require so massive a portion of 
the nation’s wealth that it is no longer possible to convince politicians 
that we can afford any more significant national goal than mere survi- 
val. And yet, to forego the means of waging war would itself inevitably 
lead to war, and a losing one at that. 

This coldly militaristic equation is the central dilemma of our time; 
without capital expenditures so massive that — barring an unforeseeable 
basic restructuring of our society — even the Federal Government cannot 
pay for them, we are trapped in a world situation of diminishing 
supplies and rising demands, a dawning age of ever-tightening resources 
that can end only in a bang or in a whimper. And yet we must maintain 
a level of armaments so expensive that seemingly we can afford nothing 
else. But there may be a way out. 

Consider. Are there not weapons that are plowshares as well? Exam- 
ple: the anti-missile lasers described in the February ’75 Galaxy are also 
potential orbital-launch devices — and their power sources would be of 
sufficient magnitude to provide a significant increment to the nation’s 
generating capacity. *And since the only answer to anti-missile lasers 
would be orbital -anti-missile lasers — solar-panel or fusion powered 
“space fortresses’’ — then if we decide to invest in laser anti-missile sys- 
tems, we had best invest in the means of protecting them as well; Space 
Shuttles that could easily be converted into orbital warships. Lots of 
them. 

And of course while our fleets of orbital fighters — pardon me; space 
shuttles — are not busy taking out hypothetical space fortresses, there 
would certainly be no sense in just letting them sit there getting rusty. 
No, they should be kept busy; building orbital factories that would be 
highly cost-effective, given cheap shuttle service; terraforming Venus 
(see September Galaxy — what would a new planet be worth?); setting 
up Lunar research facilities; disposing of nuclear wastes; building a 
fleet of real spaceships for manned exploration of the Solar Sys- 
tem. .and since our friends across the way will doubtless be construct- 
ing their own ABM laser system, perhaps we need space fortresses, too; 
whose power source when not in military use could be beaming down 
energy via microwave. But you get the idea. 

Speaking of ideas, there must be lots of possible weapons-sy stems 
with dual sword/plowshare components. Let’s hear about them. It’s your 
world, too.

THE 

EXPERIMENTER 



W ELL, gentlemen! Another two 
seconds and I would have been 
dead, lying with a knife in my 
throat on the deck of one of the ug- 
liest yachts ever built — killed by my 
own friends, gentlemen! 

What? Put this thing on my head 
so I can understand as well as be 
understood? (For I take it that’s 
what your gestures mean.) What a 
pity. So instantaneous. We could 
have taken six months; you draw lit- 
tle diagrams, you teach me the 
words for past, future, present, — I 
fall to my knees calling you 
gods — Sorry. 

I’ll stop joking. 

Three months ago — no, of course 
I can’t tell you what year it was un- 
less I can put our two calendars to- 
gether; what does a number like 
twenty-two something-something 
mean to me? — anyway, the whole 
thing started three months ago when 
the barbarian and the boy and I 
were riding off the Southern coast 
of — never mind; names change so, 
even locally. It was nighttime. Our 
barbarian, with his uncivilized ad- 
diction to cleanliness, was taking a 
bath in the sea, and the boy was 
scraping the dinner pots. I was lean- 
ing over the rail, watching our 
wake, that true Southern phos- 
phorescence you never see any- 
where else, that luminosity that 
seems at any moment about to con- 
dense into the bodies of the 
drowned, the souls of the dead, 
floating up and drifting Just under 
the surface of the water, whispering 



perhaps, smiling, gliding . 

Then the boy gave a yell and I 
nearly pitched over the side. The 
three of us stared. Then the clouds 
must have parted or some low mist 
blown aside. There it was. 

“A town,” said our barbarian, 
Sam. 

What’s funny? The machine does 
the translating, not me, doesn’t it? I 
told you we saw a town and I told 
you Sam said so; and after months 
at sea you are supposed to go wild; 
you think of restaurants, you think 
of women, you think of money, 
though not necessarily in that order. 

All except me. 

Now I want to explain this right 
now; in what I did I was never for a 
moment actuated by personal 
malice. I’m a sociable man; I like 
people and I like to see them enjoy 
themselves. But once in a 
while . never mind, perhaps I’ve 
sold my soul to the devil or he sold 
his to me! Anyway, Sam was the 
first to speak, all pronunciamento 
and seven feet tall. 

“Everyone,” he said, “must take 
a bath except me, because I have 
already had one.” 

“Oh gods, I have to shave,” said 
the boy. 

“Not with my knife,” I said. 
I’ve never met anyone so mad for 
growing up. I had stowed our good 
clothes somewhere months before 
and was looking for them behind 
some of our coiled rope and other 
gear when I collided with my tall 
friend. I have always called them 



6 




my friends, gentlemen, but the truth 
is I have never understood them. 
Never at all. I put my hand on his 
shoulder to stop him and said, 
“Look here, what do you want? 
What do you really want?” He 
looked back at me in the half-dark, 
above the lantern we keep in the 
bow, and his face looked like a 
statue carved out of stone but that 
was only a trick of the light because 
these Northerners’ eyes are blue and 
you can look right through blue 
eyes into the sky behind, like look- 
ing through the eye-holes of a skull. 

“To be rich,” he said. I’ve never 
understood that. The boy will end 
up going home, of course, because 
this is only a vacation for him — but 
I— 

“Look,” I called after Sam, “I’ll 
get it for you. A fortune. For both 
of you.” 

We landed at night. A nice clean 
little harbor with native craft, most- 
ly; you couldn’t have told, give or 
take fifty miles, where you were. 
You’ve never landed on the com- 
mercial waterfront of a small city at 
night, have yOu? — indeed, with a 
room full of such extremely interest- 
ing equipment, why should 
you? — No, of course not. Well, you 
can have no conception of such a 
* place unless you’ve been there. It is 
exactly the same, wherever you are. 
It is sinister and it is homely. The 
shadows are deep, the streets nar- 
row, here and there a light above an 
inn or coming out of an open door- 
way, and higher up you get the 

THE EXPERIMENTER 



poor quarter, and higher up still the 
commercial quarter, and if you 
know towns the way I do (they all 
fit the land they’re on as animals fit 
the lives they lead) you can work 
your way to the center in little over 
an hour. Likewise the politics. 1 
stopped a native. 

“Where is Main Street?” 

“What?” he said. 

“Great Street,” I said, “Large 
Street, Wide Street, Market Street, 
Big Street, Important Street — ” 
Thus you run down the list. We 
found it (Long-and-Large Street), 
then found we had to register at a 
government shed, which contained 
some truly horrendous warnings 
against coining. When I told them 
my plan, Sam and the boy didn’t 
oppose me — nobody ever does, 
somehow, when the fit is on me — 
so we stripped the ship and sold 
everything, including the compass, 
to buy clothes. We had to put on a 
good show as gentlemen. I told the 
other two I was going to get ar- 
rested and to stick with me; so the 
next morning, brilliantly dressed, I 
went up to a flower-seller’s booth 
on Second-Biggest Street, took out 
our last gold piece, and bought a 
bouquet. Something called Tyrrhe- 
nian Violet Mix, as I remember. 

“My dear elevatedness,” crooned 
the florist, “allow me the nearly 
unbearable pleasure of giving you 
your change.” The gold was mak- 
ing him tremble with greed. 

“No, no,” said I, assuming an 
unidentifiable foreign accent.

“But yes,” he said. “But please. 
Allow me. Make me happy!” He 
doubled up over the counter like a 
snail. 

“Oh well,” said I; “If you in- 
sist, give me one small coin for this 
darling child who assists you in ty- 
ing up the flowers and I will place 
it in his hand myself.” 

He gave me my change. I looked 
at it casually; I stared at it hard; I 
turned pale; I bit it; I cried: 

“Counterfeit!” 

One doesn’t wish to be arrested 
for criminal misbehavior, you see; 
that doesn’t get you anywhere. This 
was a very strictly governed little 
town. I will mention only in passing 
the heads stuck on pikes along the 
battlements of the Governor’s 
palace on High-and-Handsome 
Street, the lists of taxes, and the 
license hanging in the inn where we 
had spent the night. As a common 
brawler, 1 would have been in a 
mess; but here I was the complain- 
ant. We were flanked by the local 
gendarmerie in what must have 
been record time (thirty seconds), in 
ten minutes we were in front of a 
judge, and in fifteen minutes the 
coin was pronounced genuine. I had 
rather hoped it wouldn’t be. 

“Fraud!” I cried. 

“Arrest him!” said the judge, 
waking up for the first time during 
the entire proceedings. 

“For what?” said I. “I have said 
nothing.” 

“Quiet!” shouted the judge, re- 
ally angry this time. 

8 



“Only,” 1 continued imperturb- 
ably, “Fraud, which in my beautiful, 
rich, and very far away country sig- 
nifies distress and extreme pain of 
mind. I have an imperfect under- 
standing of your magnificent lan- 
guage. Would a wealthy man like 
myself’ — here the courtroom grew 
very quiet all of a sudden — “would 
wealthy men like the three of us, I 
repeat, millionaires with commercial 
connections all over the known 
world and in some other places too, 
be concerned with anything but the 
principle of law involved in the 
forging of a small coin? Of course 
not.” 

“Alas,” I continued, “that I 
cannot now import into your oh- 
so-desirable country the gold with 
which I had hoped to start three or 
four of my worldwide, extremely 
moneymaking enterprises. But prin- 
ciple must prevail. Honesty — ” 

“You’re under arrest,” said the 
judge. “And I’ll examine you in 
private. Keep those other two in 
custody.” 

“Ah,” I said. “Good.” 

Look here, gentlemen, don’t you 
talk to me about luck. I always 
know what I’m doing. Once I’d 
read the notices in that damned reg- 
istry office! — there were such 
heavy penalties for bribery, you 
see. Do laws punish what nobody 
ever does? His Wisdom got us into 
an ornate little stone room at the 
back of the court, fitted up with 
carpets (and gilding), locked us in, 
took out a bottle of something— 



GALAXY 




“Thanks, no,” I said, dropping 
my accent. “I prefer to talk busi- 
ness.” He dropped the bottle. Luck- 
ily there was a carpet on the floor, 
too. He stared at me, but I said noth- 
ing. I had my back to the win- 
dow, which is always nice. He was 
a silly man; the first thing he did 
was get up and make for the door. 

“Please, please,” 1 said, “I am 
defenseless. Besides, your admira- 
ble door locks with a key, not a 
bolt or latch, and I managed to 
abstract the key whilst you were 
busy with the bottle; I would 
advise — ” 

“Murderer!” he said. He had 
turned pale and was attempting to 
ring a bell set under the table with- 
out my seeing him do it. 

The role of 
anthropology 
in outer space 

How should a space colony 
be designed? How can it 
prepare for possible contact 
with non-human extraterres- 
trial cultures? In this unique 
anthology anthropologists, 
scientists, writers, and an 
Apollo flight technician 
speculate on how anthro- 
pology as a discipline can 
help us prepare for the 
coming age of space travel.

“Don’t,” I said. “Besides, you 
are quite safe. I’m a reasonable 
man. I really do like to make 
money.” I smiled. “And I like to 
see other people make money.” 
“But you have money already.” 
“Not a penny I replied.” He went 
for the door again. 

“Please,” I said. “Please, my 
dear fellow, do be calm. Do you 
think I want to hurt or rob you? If I 
do either, I shall undoubtedly be 
sawn in half, or whatever nasty 
method of execution it is you use in 
this part of the world.” 

“Then — ” he began unhappily. 
“Why go through such an elabo- 
rate farce? That’s of course what 
you were about to say, since you 
are such an intelligent man. The

answer is that for political 
purposes — which I shall go into 
presently — I needed to get in touch 
immediately with someone of great 
importance. Someone of great intel- 
ligence.” I spread my hands. 
“Yourself.” 

“Polit — ” he said. 

I leaned forward, speaking in a 
very low voice. 

“I must know,” I said. “Are 
you for the Governor or — ’ ’ 

“Guards!” he screamed. He had 
backed away from me as far as he 
could go, bending himself uncom- 
fortably into the doorknob. He 
turned and rattled it piteously. 
“Guards!” 

“Do,” I said, springing to my 
feet and altering my whole manner. 
“Do. Protest your loyalty. Swear. 
Will they believe you?” 

He sweated, poised on one foot 
like a top. 

“How do you know who sent 
me?” I went on grimly. “Eh? How 
do you know what they want, what 
they’d like? How do you know what 
they’ve found out?” 

“Guards,” he squeaked. I 
shrugged elaborately. I threw myself 
back into my chair. I began to play 
with the pair of gentleman’s gloves 
I had bought that morning, magiiifi- 
cent things, really, openwork of 
leather and gold; they seem to make 
them very well in that region. 

“You don’t have to make the de- 
cision yourself,” I said. 

“No?” he said. 

“No,” I said, looking very grave 

10 



and compassionate. “No indeed. 
Mind you. I’m only telling you this 
because of my regard for you. I 
hate to see people be — but never 

mind. Don’t you think the best 
thing to do would be send me to 
— ah — someone higher up? I won’t 
say a word if you do.” 

He had been standing on one foot 
all this time, I swear it; now he de- 
scended to two, so relieved to be 
bipedal again. He sighed and wiped 
his head. He smiled pitifully. He 
held out one hand — heart-felt — then 
snatched it back again in evident 
fear that 1 would garotte him. 

“Never mind,” I said. “Not all 
of us are cut out for the — ah — real 
complexities of — well, you know 
what I mean.” 

“Yes,” he said, collapsing into 
his chair. “Oh yes. I do. Yes, yes, 
I do.” 

So that’s done. 

* ★ * 

Was I at my ease? To tell you the 
truth, no. But I could deal with 
him. He was a lean, dry, clean- 
shaven old man in a voluminous 
crimson tent. He leaned on two 
sticks. He made me sit down and 
then he staggered up to me so that 
his parchment face leaned over 

mine, trembling as he said: 

“How old are you?” 

“Twenty-two,” said I. 

“Ha — hmmmmm.” He cleared 
his throat, and then spat, and then 
looked absently out of the window 
of his reception room. You saw the 

GALAXY 




marble arches and the whitewashed 
walls, and trees and hedges outside, 
very pretty if you didn’t notice the 
soldiers. He gathered the stuff of 
his .robe between two fingers and 
flashed an enormous ruby on one of 
them. Vanity. Of some kind. 

“Did you think,” said he, “that 
your mummery would succeed?” 

1 said I thought it would get me 
to someone like him, but not so 
high up. 

“Have you done anything like 
this before?” said he, turning sharp- 
ly round. 

“Twice,” I said. “But not 
exactly like this.” It’s true, too; I 
have never found it necessary to lie 
to anyone. People are amazingly 
prolific at jumping to conclusions. 
Walk up to any official in a provin- 
cial town and say, “They know.” 
Then run. 

“Have you any money?” the old 
man said to me. This obviously 
didn’t interest him. 

“None,” said I. 

“Ha — hmmmmm.” He was look- 
ing out the window again. “And 
what do you want? Every man 
wants something.” 1 stayed silent. 
He got up and hobbled over to me. 
“Tell me,” he said. 1 shrugged. 

“Tell me or I’ll have you — ” 

“But 1 don’t know!” I said. He 
limped back and lowered himself 
into his chair with an extended 
grimace. 

“Nothing,” said he, “can ease 
the pains of old age, young man. 
Remember that. My people thought 

THE EXPERIMENTER 



you were an assassin. Obvious non- 
sense, of course. You’re mad.” 
“I’ve been told so,” said I. His 
eyes glittered. 

“You must be,” he said. “You 
don’t have money and you don’t 
want it. I’ll tell you something, my 
mad friend: I’m crazy too. We’re 
the only two people in this town 
who see things as they are. Power 
is better than money. Now: out with 
it.” 

I told him. He laughed until he 
cried. Then he said: 

“How did you know I was in the 
Duke’s faction?” 

“I didn’t,” I said. 

“But if I hadn’t been — ?” 

“Oh,” I said, “the plan! The 
plan can be sold to anyone. It can 
even be turned inside out and used 
by the Governor; that doesn’t mat- 
ter. It doesn’t matter what side 
you’re on.” 

He laughed again, started cough- 
ing, stopped, laughed, and then 
abruptly looked grim. He clapped his 
hands. Three crafty kids sprang 
from the thin, thin air. 

“This young man,” he said 
sternly, “is my particular guest. Find 
him and his friends a place to stay. 
Watch him — but not his friends; I 
don’t think we need go that far 
yet — at all times.” He gave an 
enormous yawn. “By the way,” he 
added suddenly (darting up to me 
with wonderful, unsteady quickness) 
“how did you know there was 
a — hm — faction?” He thrust his 
wrinkled face up to mine. I had the 

11 




sudden feeling that one of those 
fresh-faced lads might be ready with 
a blade in my back. So I told the 
truth, as I always do. 

“There always is,” I said. 
“Everywhere.” 

it if it 

I could say there were times 
when I felt tempted to take his 
money and run, but I would be ly- 
ing. I wouldn’t have gone for the 
world. Besides, the money was 
Sam’s, not mine; whatever I got, I 
sent to him. My very important lord 
had settled me in the city and I was 
buying up grain — with his gold, of 
course — and dumping it off the 
coast, secretly, at night. 

Do you know what happens when 
you make something artificially 
scarce? 

That’s right, the price goes up. 
It’s like having a bad season. When 
the price of grain goes up, the price 
of bread follows; bread is three- 
quarters of the diet of the poor and 
when they can’t afford it — 

Five weeks after my real arrival I 
arrived again, but this time as a dif- 
ferent stranger with a bag of gold a 
yard long (my lord’s gold, of 
course) under one arm and under 
the other, elaborate plans for a 
company that would manufacture 
fertilizer from sea-sand. The Minis- 
ter of Finance all but wept in my 
lap. 

Not that he really thought fer- 
tilizer could be made from sea-sand, 
you understand, (though I think he 

12 



had a few dim gleams of hope on 
the subject) but any fool with 
money was a godsend at this time, 
with the poorer classes so restless. I 
ordered lumber, building stone, and 
workmen, and I paid six times as 
much as anyone else. The price of 
wheat (their staple commodity, you 
understand) rose. I raised wages. 
The price of bread went up even 
faster. I raised wages again. A 
starving mob broke into our factory, 
there were riots in the harbor streets, 
someone set fire to part of a slum, 
and the Minister of Finance (stand- 
ing on the smoking ruins), dedi- 
cated the site to a new temple of the 
Sun-God, swearing that would solve 
everything. Prices rose. Nobody 
could understand why — when there 
was so much money to be had — 
they couldn’t buy anything. Prices 
rose. 

I thought the Minister of Finance 
would get bold (and ruin every- 
thing) by confiscating the mer- 
chants’ stores for rationing, but trust 
our boy! he had no desire to be torn 
limb from limb by enraged grain- 
dealers. To be absolutely fair I 
ought to add that the wheat my lord 
and I had dumped in the sea con- 
tinued to have a confusing and 
tenuous life of its own; that is to 
say, the dummy merchants we had 
set up reported they were still doing 
business, so that according to the 
records, there should have been 
enough to eat. I think I am the only 
person in the world who knows that 
gold does not exist — oh, I don’t

good is a yellow, soft metal that 
you can’t eat or burn or make into 
tools? None at all. It’s as if people 
had all made some crazy agreement 
to honor it — why not cowrie shells, 
or cows, or trees, or pieces of rock? 

If only everybody agreed and 
kept the amount of stuff the same, 
it wouldn’t matter what you used. 
Break that agreement and overnight 
there would be no town, no posses- 
sions, no government, no owner- 
ship, no anything. Do you see? 
Well, no one else ever has. In your 
own words, here these poor idiots 
were believing that the “medium of 
exchange’’ meant something in it- 
self and by itself, and there I was, 
arranging that there should be more 
and more medium and less and less 
to exchange. Prices rose. Rumors 
began to circulate that the Sun God 
was angry with the citizens, that 
gold — which everybody knows is 
His condensed breath — was losing 
its power, that soon nights of a 
week long would descend on the 
city and every third citizen 
would be eaten by locusts. Prices 
rose. 

‘ ‘Never, ’ ’ said the Finance Minister 
in formal proclamation from a bal- 
cony of the palace, while a band 
played music below him, “does 
Our Governor hear the complaints 
of His hungry poor unmoved. His 
father is the Sun-God Ya; His 
mother is the silvery Moon-Goddess 
Yup; how can Their power have 
been abated? Fear not; you will all 

THE EXPERIMENTER 



be wealthy by and by; Our Gover- 
nor will not stand by inactive at 
such an hour,’’ etc. etc. 

Then that crazy man raised the 
salaries of all government employees 
and distributed a tax rebate to 
every householder. Prices rose. 

Let me make it clear before I ut- 
ter another word that there was 
enough to eat. They could have got- 
ten through the winter quite well on 
a strict system of rationing. But 
who ever did anything unpopular if 
he could help it? My lord, although 
by now excessively poor, was over- 
joyed. 

“Am I of use to you or am I 
not?’’ I said. 

“Indeed you have been,’’ he 
answered. It hit me some quarter of 
an hour later, that have been. 

■k -k -k 

I saw it begin with my own eyes. 
My lord, with the last of his wealth, 
had been coining money himself — 
base, obvious, leaden counterfeits — 
and when the Finance Minister 
ordered his last, grand, general 
Bonus (and simultaneously an- 
nounced his retirement) my lord 
substituted his false coinage for the 
Minister’s true one. 

That did it; I tell you, that did it; 
you have never seen such a thing as 
it was. 

I was in the street with my lord 
when it happened, near one of the 
barrier tables the militia had set up 
to distribute the coins. A liquor- 
house keeper tried to palm 

13 




off one of them at an old lady’s 
food-stand; she screamed “Police! 
Police!’’ just as several others dis- 
covered the same thing; and then 
the whole crowd must have grasped 
the same fact at exactly the same 
time, for there was a roar such as I 
have never heard before in my life, 
a roar from a thousand throats at 
once in that one frozen moment be- 
fore the crowd became a mob and 
the mob an avalanche. 

My lord grasped my elbow and 
whispered in my ear, “Get out of 
town,’’ and as I obediently slipped 
into a side-street, I heard behind me 
that oceanic tidal-wave of sound 
and the crash of the first tables go- 
ing down. 

Sam and the boy, thanks be, had 
put out to sea that afternoon; we’d 
arranged to meet Just out of sight of 
the bay. North of the harbor. But I 
had to stay; I had to see it. I tell 
you, my heart was beating like 
mad. It was senseless; there was no 
reason for me to stay but I couldn’t 
leave. It fascinated me. Fighting 
must have started on the main av- 
enues for I caught glimpses of ar- 
rows and men running past the little 
streets with scythes, butcher knives, 
poles, anything they could pick up. 
I tell you, I couldn’t stop. They 
were breaking into stores; it was 
glorious and horrible, women rush- 
ing by pushing baby-wagons piled 
with fruit or clothes. My lord had 
apparently hired orators, or perhaps 
they’d sprung out of the ground; 
some were touting the Duke as pre- 



tender; others were abusing 
everyone and everything. It was a 
ghastly mish-mash about the sun go- 
ing out and the Governor cheating 
everybody; it would’ve taken a 
genius to keep it all straight. I 
threw away the gold chain my lord 
had given me and wrapped myself 
in a dirty cloak I found in the street; 
it was almost night and torches 
were being lit at every corner, not 
that they needed them with the light 
from bonfires and burning houses. I 
had stopped to listen to one of the 
agitators and join in the singing, but 
I slipped past them. Someone ran 
through, shouting that people were 
dying on Street; he dis- 

appeared. There was another bon- 
fire. 

“ — and will we stand it? No, we 
will not stand it!’’ 

Someone said, ‘ ‘Got some tobac- 
co?’’ close to me and a hand slipped 
into my pocket; I twisted it good 
and hard and moved away into a 
doorway. Someone else, next to 
me, struck a light. It was one of my 
lord’s fresh-faced little murderers. 
He was smiling at me. 

“Not bad,” he said, “not bad at 
all, but getting a little out of hand, 
we think.” I followed his glance 
across the street and there, peering 
ravenously out of a second-story 
window, was my very important 
lord. He grasped the window-sill 
with one hand and raised the other 
savagely, bringing it down in a 
short, cutting arc; from the next 
doorway peeped out another baby-

GALAXY 




face and from the next doorway 
another. Without thinking (for I go 
blind in panic) I shinnied up a 
drainpipe by the doorway and fell 
on to a roof. 

Have you ever run over roofs? 
Don’t. People expect adventurers to 
be athletic but the only advantage I 
had was that I was scared to death 
and — ^just possibly — the baby-faces 
got peevish and insisted that while 
killing people was in their line, 
climbing roofs wasn’t and they 
weren’t paid for it. Not that I stopped 
to watch, you understand. I jumped 
gaps in those roofs where I left my 
stomach behind thirty feet below in 
the street, and I walked boards you 
could not have ordinarily persuaded 
me to try two inches off the ground. 
Once I was crazy enough to swing 
from roof to roof on a line of dry- 
ing wash which didn’t even break. 
All the time I ran I could hear them 
behind me and I saw them once, 
when I turned, climbing behind me 
in a slow, deliberate way, as if they 
knew where I was going even 
though r did not. And I didn’t; I 
had no more sense of direction up 
there than a — 

Then I met one of them coming 
the other way. 

I dove into the street — I say dove 
because I went nearly headlong, 
caught an awning, snapped it, 
swung, dropped into the street, ran 
around the corner, and following 
nothing but blind instinct, ran into a 
door — found it locked — swung up 
on a window-ledge, made the next

highest window with a ledge six inch- 
es wide, clung there like a sleep- 
walker, with swimming head and 
shaking knees, and plummeted into 
the room inside all in a heap. 

There was a girl in the room, 
braiding her hair. 

I remember now— though I 
wasn’t capable of connecting the 
two things then — that she must have 
been of the very highest class, for 
she was dressed in a long-sleeved, 
brocaded jacket that gleamed in the 
lamplight; she wore a silk shirt and 
had little bits of gold hung all over 
her: ankle bells, rings, earrings, 
bracelets, pins. 

But all I saw then was a glow, a 
shimmer, and a tinkling of orira- 
ments. 

“Madam!” I gasped, “for 
Heaven’s sake!” and she came over 
quite unhurriedly, to inspect me. 
She could not have been more than 
twelve years old. She had — how 
shall I say — a certain unpleasant 
expression, as if she were used to 
ordering people around, including 
her mamma and papa. She looked 
at me with great interest and then 
said: 

“I do believe someone is chasing 
you. You must be very wicked.” 

“Beautiful lady,” said I (with 
what voice I had left) “someone is 
indeed chasing me, although I as- 
sure your ladyship that I am not in 
the least wicked” (here I heaved a 
breath) “but only a poor, desperate, 
unfortunate, and terrified rascal, 
who throws himself both figura- 

15 




lively and literally at your lady- 
ship’s exquisite feet.” Try talking 
that way when you can’t breathe. 

“You,” said this little girl to me, 
“have charming black curly hair 
and very dreamy eyes, but I do 
think you entered my room rather 
ungallantly.” 

“Madam!” I said, throwing my 
arms about her knees, “fair one, 
beautiful lady, lovely one, if they 
catch me, they will kill me right 
here on your rug, so for Yup’s 
sake, hide me!” 

“That would be awful,” she 
said, “because it would make a 
stain” — I am not making this up — 
and she took me by the hand and 
pulled me into a little alcove, shov- 
ing me behind some clothes. I heard 
her ankle-bells go leisurely from 
one side of the room to the other 
and then 1 heard her yawn and 
then — marvelous little actress! — she 
said, “Oh! Who are you?” 

Well, they asked me about her 
and she described a horrible spirit 
who had looked into the window 
and then disappeared — “1 prayed” 
she said — and they said Are you re- 
ally telling the truth and she said 
How dare you and so on and so 
on — but a deadly cold faintness was 
coming over me; I would have giv- 
en anything, even my life, for a 
chance to lie down, to lie down 
flat, and never never ever to get up 
again. 

When I came to myself I was ly- 
ing on the floor of the closet with 
my head in her lap and she was put- 

16 



ting her hot little hands all over my 
face and neck to wake me up. 

“Angel,” I said. She smiled 
complacently. 

“Ssssh,” she said, “Lie still. 
They’ll watch the roof for a while. I 
heard them say so. Here — ” and 
she brought me pieces of sugar- 
candy and fed them to me and gave 
me something insipid to drink out 
of a little silver bottle. It tasted like 
the essence of all the oranges that 
ever weren’t, but I needed it. 

“I wish,” I said quite sincerely, 
“that I could give you something. 
You’ve been so good to me.” 

“I have everything,” she said, 
patting her hair. 

“All the same — ” 1 said, and I 
searched my pockets but they were 
as empty as my grave; “All the 
same, I wish — ” 

“Kiss my hand,” she said, ex- 
tending it and looking at me in what 
1 can only describe as a very cal- 
culating manner. ‘Tm sure this is 
dreadfully wrong,” she added com- 
templatively, “but as I’m to be 
married next week, I suppose it’s 
all right.” She smiled and a charm- 
ing little dimple appeared on each 
side of her chin. “If you’d really 
like to show you’re grateful,” she 
said, “you may give me a gift, al- 
though it’ll have to be something I 
can give back to you at the same 
time. Mamma watches me like a 
hawk.” 

I knew what she meant, so I said 
“May I — ?” and she shut her eyes 
and I — what else? — kissed her. It’s 



GALAXY 




in the tradition, gentlemen. But it’s 
not in the tradition that the lady 
shall fling her arms around you and 
hold onto you until you can’t 
breathe, while you don’t dare get 
free, for obvious reasons. Finally 
she let me go; apparently everything 
was perfectly proper as far as she 
was concerned. 

“Remember me!’’ she whispered, 
waving a tiny, embroidered silk 
handkerchief as I climbed out the 
window, dreading the fall to the 
ground and broken bones. “Re- 
member me!” “Angel!” I cried, “I 
shall never forget you!” and nearly 
dislocated my neck falling into the 
street. 

I got myself up in one piece and 
searching my pockets, found a piece 
of candy. It hadn’t occurred to her 
to give me money, 1 suppose. 
Though money was not much use in 
this town any more. There was a 
faint glow in the East and I could 
hear — very far away — some kind of 
noise. I walked slowly through the 
streets. By the time I got to the 
waterfront it was nearly dawn. I tell 
you, somehow the joy had gone out 
of it. I had no feeling at all. I found 
an old man smoking by the docks 
ar.d begged some tobacco from him, 
which I wrapped in a piece of my 
shirt and put in my pocket. 

“Tell me,” I said, “did you see 
a big man come by here earlier to- 
night? A big, yellow-haired man 
with a boy?” He spat on the 
ground. 

“I seen the whole town come by 

THE EXPERIMENTER 



here,” he said resentfully. “The 
whole damn lot. Screeching like 
water bufloes.” I was beginning to 
feel just how tired I was and my 
back and legs ached. “Tell me — ” 
I said, but stopped in mid-sentence. 
What was the use? I sat down on 
the pier. I was too tired. I was just 
too tired. 

Now I would have to steal a 
boat. 

So I did. I mean I took it, that’s 
all. They’d left only a child to 
guard the government house and I 
bribed him with my tobacco — none 
of them would look at money any 
more! — and besides, what did he 
care? He expected Utopia to dawn 
the next morning. The foreign ships 
were gone — so was ours — and so 
was everything else except a few 
planks with sails on them — they call 
them “butterflies,” I believe. I took 
one of them and I was so tired that 
if there’d been any kind of weather 
at all, I would’ve just rolled off the 
plank into the sea. I felt queer, too, 
as if I’d been finished off or been 
sick; 1 don’t know what it was. I 
got to our ship by the lights — oh, 
the blessed sound of black water 
against wood! — and hauled myself 
up; I would have fallen if they 
hadn’t helped me. 

“Is your scheme finished?” said 
my barbarian, sounding very grim 
and deep in the darkness. 

“It is,” said I, “and so am I, for 
that matter.” 

“Not quite,” said he, “turn 
around,” and when I did so, I saw 

17 




that the whole Southern sky — from 
horizon to zenith — was a brilliant 
red. The city was on fire. 

“Good God — “I said, “they 
must have — the torches — •” 

“Now that you have finished,” 
said that barbarian, “can you tell us 
what you have brought back to us, 
out of that wreck?” 

“I had some tobacco,” I said. 
“No, I gave it away — and my gold 
chain — there’s your money — but 
that’s all — ” 

“We’ve spent it,” said the boy. 
My friend squatted down beside me 
in the glow. The fire lit up the sea 
as far out as we were, and for the 
fnst time in my life I could clearly 
see the thoughts in those empty. 
Northern eyes. I have never liked 
those eyes, friend though he be. 

“I have sailed with you since you 
were fifteen years old,” he said, 
“but I tell you — ” 

“Why'd you do it?” whispered 
the boy in wonder. 

“I tell you!” shouted Sam, “I 
tell you never\ Never before!” He 
put his face up to mine. 

“That town is burning,” he said. 
“Everyone in it will be dead. Twice 
before 1 wondered: why does he do 
these things. But now I think I 
know.” 

“Tell me then,” I said; “it’ll be 
news to me,” and it was at that 
moment, gentlemen, it was at that 
very moment that he pushed my 
face into the boards — I bear the 
marks of the splinters yet! — that he 
pushed, I say, my face into the 

18 



boards and wrenching sideways, I 
saw that my old companion was 
about to put a knife in my neck and 
that our boy approved and stood by 
silently, his arms folded. 

That was, fortunately, the exact 
moment in which you plucked me 
out of time (five thousand years into 
the future, if I’m to believe you) 
and deposited me in this shining 
kitchen. 

It’s not a kitchen? Well, a 
glorified kitchen, then, a transcen- 
dent kitchen! 

And they wanted to kill me. 
Why? Did I ask those damned fools 
to burn their city? Did I ask them to 
be so stupid? If there ’d been anyone 
there with the slightest sense, I 
couldn’t have gotten one foot into 
that town! Not that I like the idea of 
my little preserver being burnt, or 
raped by the militia, or having her 
golden bells torn off her ankles; I’m 
not inhuman. Still — why should 
they kill me? It’s their own fault for 
finding no decent work for me! If I 
have a— a force, a glory, some- 
thing, call it what you like — inside 
me that must be satisfied, then let 
me satisfy it; let me make things 
happen, let me study things. If I 
could have studied stars, or clouds, 
or dirt, I would not have had to 
study men. If I had a place like 
this, now — ! 

Gentlemen, how can I believe 
you’ll send me back? That would be 
murder. I’ve never murdered; I’ve 
only given people the power to 
choose one course of action or 



GALAXY 




another. Is it my fault that they al- 
ways choose wrong? 

Well, what about it? Remember, 
I’ve been here five days (if you 
count the first day when 1 did noth- 
ing but sleep) — I’m rested, well- 
fed, and much stronger than I was. 
Now I’ll wrench myself free (much 
astounding Sam) and it’ll be a hell- 
for-leather, round-the-mast, tooth- 
and-nail battle. They’ll get me in 
the end, though, for there are two 
of them and only one of me and 
besides — I blush to confess it, gen- 
tlemen, it’s most unbefitting an 
adventurer — I cannot swim. 

So you will send me back? 
You’ve decided — like my friends — 
that I’m a devil? Not just a little 
cleverer than most, a little more 
clear-sighted than most, eh? A little 
more inclined to experiment with 
things? It’s your decision. Chin up, 
stiff upper lip, we who are about to 
die — I hope your translator is find- 



would so love to stay. But perhaps 
you believe that I’m not just clev- 
erer than the people five thousand 
years ago, but a little more so than 
you, eh? Even here. Even now. A 
little closer to the power and the 
glory? That would be sad. 

Better to send me back. With that 
little button. Oh yes, I watched you 
work it and fuss over it when I first 
came here; in fact, you took such 
care of it. I’d bet it’s the only one 
you have. 

It would be a shame if some bar- 
barian fool from the past gave its 
insides a general, quiet bashing 
when he first got here, when you 
left him alone because you thought 
he was so exhausted he could do 
nothing but sleep. He knew, you 
see, that it had brought him here, 
and he was damned if it was going 
to send him back. Don’t be foolish; 
of course I didn’t let it show on the 
outside. 



ing the right equivalents. Too bad; I Open the front panel and look. 




You see? I always tell the truth. 
Now we can have a much more 
interesting conversation. A real 
conversation. 

Eh? ★ 



THE EXPERIMENTER 



19 





HORACE 



Before i tell you how I came to 
do what I did, I have to tell you 
how I affected the world from birth 
on. 

I was born the year World War 1 
started, graduated the year 
Roosevelt and Hitler came to pow- 
er, got married the day World War 
II began, had a son 20 days after 
Pearl Harbor, founded Galaxy 
magazine just minutes ahead of the 
Korean War, got divorced the year 
of Sputnick, remarried the year of 
the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. 

In other words. I’m an historical 
Typhoid Mary and should be paid a 
dollar by every man, woman and 
child on Earth — a lousy buck 
apiece — not to make any major 
moves any more. 

While I’m waiting for that, let 
me tell you some lesser details of 
how I came to do what I did. 

I discovered science-fiction when 
I was 13 — a magazine with mon- 

20 



L. GOLD 



strous ants and a spastic man looking 
up at a girl in a bronze bra and 
filmy skirt being tenderly held in 
the mandibles of one of the bugs. It 
was beautiful, so beautiful that I 
decided right then to become an sf 
writer. As for not deciding to be- 
come an sf artist, how could a 13- 
year-old-kid — or anyone else, for 
that matter — compete with the peer- 
less Frank R. Paul? 

So 1 studied English and the sci- 
ences as hard as I could and wrote 
stories for the school magazines. 
After that, I wrote and wrote — 
thousands and thousands of words 
that — well. I’d walk to the post of- 
fice to mail my stories and come 
back to find a rejection slip waiting 
for me at home. I never could fig- 
ure out how the editors did that. 

Then I started bringing manu- 
scripts to the editors instead of mail- 
ing them. I got them back even fas- 
ter that way. But I persevered — and 




one day I brought a story to a won- 
derful old man named T. O’Connor 
Sloane. He got dangerously excited 
about it for a man of 82 — but he 
said it was much t.oo good for 
Amazing Stories. So he took it and 
me upstairs to the editor of the 
company’s prestige magazine, the 
Delineator , and demanded that it be 
read. 1 got it back when I returned 
home. I think it arrived before I 
did. Next month, the Delineator 
folded. I immediately saw the con- 
nection but I wanted to sell that 
story and brought it back to Dr. 
Sloane. He maintained that it was 
too good for his magazine and re- 
fused to buy it. 

So I never sold that story because 
Amazing was the only sf magazine 
at that time, and I lost the story 
somehow. I can’t tell you if it was 
all that good, but maybe you can 
judge by what I remember of it. In 
it, I manfully exposed the mis- 
creants who were exploiting the 
slave labor in the mines of Venus, 
and told of the revolt that freed the 
poor Earthlings. 

Now if that story was too good 
for Amazing, maybe it accounted 
for the dreadful stories Dr. Sloane 
bought. But can you imagine what 
the rejects were like? 

Well, I was 18 then and not too 
easily discouraged. I went on writ- 
ing. My parents were vociferously 
against it. How, they wanted to 
know, could anyone make a living 
putting black marks on white paper? 
So I wrote and worked at any job I 



could find, and there weren’t many, 
because this was at the bottom of 
the Great Depression. I remember 
being a busboy in a fancy place 
called Roadside Rest. I was inter- 
viewed by three Rumanian brothers, 
who owned it, and, though I didn’t 
know it, I was hired because there 
was nobody else around. So I 
worked from 10 in the morning un- 
til 2 the next morning — and then 
had to walk home because the buses 
stopped running at midnight. It was 
a 7-mile walk and I was pooped. 
But I was there at 10 the next morn- 
ing, ready to put in another 16-hour 
day. Did I mention that I worked 
for the waiters, seven of them, and 
each gave me a quarter, or a grand 
total of $1.75? 

But the brothers were there al- 
ready and I was told to come into 
the office, where they unanimously 
told me I couldn’t work there any 
more. 

But why, I asked. Because, they 
said, you are a writer, an artist, and 
we just couldn’t stand the thought 
of a writer being a busboy. 

But you’re not paying me, I argued, 
the waiters are — and besides. I’ve 
never sold a story, so how can I be 
called a writer? They were Ruma- 
nianly adamant, though I begged, 
pleaded, cajoled. I went home in 
despair— and found a letter from 
someone named Desmond Hall 
awaiting me. It was on Street & 
Smith stationery — and it said that he 
was happy to inform me that my 
latest story had been accepted for 




Astounding Stories \ A check would 
be arriving soon! 

I showed my parents the letter. 
They were unconvinced. After all, 
how much could a story bring? I 
didn’t know. The letter didn’t say, 
only that Mr. Hall was cutting 1500 
words from it. I told my parents 
that brought the wordage to 
19,500 — and if they paid a cent a 
word, it would be $195, or $97.50 
for half a cent. They scoffed. But 
the check arrived in a week or 
so — and it was for an astounding 
$195! I suddenly became a big man 
in my family’s eyes, a 20-year old 
writer! 

I went to meet Mr. Hall, who 
immediately put me on a first-name 
basis, and said he wanted to buy 
more material from me. So I moved 
from Far Rockaway, a seashore re- 
sort that was mobbed in the summer 
and abandoned in winter, a dismal 
place to live, to Greenwich Village, 
just ten minutes’ walk from Street 
& Smith. It was wonderful. I sold 
half a dozen stories to Des in pretty 
short order. He told me it was im- 
possible to make a living writing 
science fiction and urged me to di- 
versify. But first, I didn’t know 
how, and second, it was sf I wanted 
to write. 

Meanwhile, my first story was 
published and appeared on the 
stands. More important than my be- 
ing immortal for a month was that 
Hitler and Mussolini promptly 
launched an attack on the Rhineland 
and Ethiopia. 



★ * ★ 

Now Astounding was nominally 
edited by F. Orlin Tremaine, but 
Des Hall was the actual editor. And 
one day Des was promoted to editor 
of Mademoiselle', he had won first 
prize for the name, though Tre- 
maine became its first editor. Tre- 
maine had done such a lousy job 
that Street & Smith put out a sec- 
ond Volume I, Number I. So Tre- 
maine had been demoted and found 
himself with 3 million words to 
read for Astounding over a 
weekend. Instead of going through 
the manuscripts, however, he hur- 
ried to the Tombs to get an as- 
trological reading from an impris- 
oned fortune teller named 
Evangeline Adams, the leading as- 
trologist of the day. He had to wait 
while Wall Street men crowded into 
her cell. I don’t know what she told 
him, but — here it gets a little com- 
plicated. 

I was writing under the name of 
Clyde Crane Campbell. The other 
Campbell, Jown W. Jr., wasn’t well 
enough known at the time to make 
it seem a less likely name for me. 
The Reason? Nazism’s anti- 
Semitism had spread all through the 
world and it permeated Street & 
Smith, so I knew better than to 
write under my own name. When 
Des was promoted, he recom- 
mended me as his successor on As- 
tounding. I was turned down be- 
cause of my religion. If you think I 
was angry, you should have seen

and heard Des! And I never sold a 
word to Tremaine. 

That’s not entirely Tremaine’s 
fault. 1 had run out of good sf ideas 
and he didn’t know and cared even 
less how to get them out of me, as 
Hall had. So I became book re- 
viewer for Mile, at a fat $15 a 
month — and couldn’t get review 
books from the publishers — they 
told me to come back when 
Mademoiselle was established! I 
consequently had to rewrite reviews 
from the New York Times and 
Herald-Tribune , which turned out to 
be a bad notion and my column was 
dropped. I wrote one story for 
Mile., under the name of Julian 
Graey (I had tried Grey, then Gray, 
and finally combined them and sold 
one single story). It was a cockeyed 
comedy in the vein of the wild 
humor of the Thirties. And that was 
that. 

I returned home when I had no 
choice. I sold shoes Saturdays for 
$4 a day and would have worked 
more had there been enough busi- 
ness to warrant it. Come summer, I 
became a professional drowner. The 
city was threatening to lay off 
lifeguards on stretches of beach that 
were officially safe — where nobody 
drowned or had to be rescued. So I 
would swim out beyond the ropes 
and thrash around until the guard on 
the beach saved me. 1 had to be 
carried to the nearest first-aid sta- 
tion and revived. Thinking up a 
new name and address for each 
drowning took some doing, but it

wasn’t that that ended my career. 
The last guard had dived to rescue 
me — and laid his head open on the 
catamaran and I had to pull him in. 
I couldn’t go from hero to victim 
again, and that was the end of my 
easy $1.50 per drowning. 

Three years passed, years of 
hunting for work, finding very lit- 
tle, and trying to write over my 
family’s renewed objections. I can’t 
blame them. It was terribly dis- 
couraging. 

* * * 

And then came John W 
Campbell, Jr., new editor of As- 
tounding. I got a splendid letter 
from him about a story I had dis- 
piritedly written and submitted. It 
was a lackluster creation about a 
man and dog getting their identities 
switched, and their attempts to get 
the villain, a surgeon, to switch 
them back again. The real prob- 
lem, wrote Campbell, was com- 
munication — how could the 
man in the dog’s body convey his 
predicament to someone who could 
help him? I spent two months on 
the story — but Campbell bought it, 
retitled it “A Matter of Form” and 
ran it as his first Nova story. It was 
disastrous financially, but it went 
over so well that I followed with 
the same reporter-detective hero in 
‘‘Problem in Murder,” the search 
for the mass murderer who left legs 
and arms in garbage cans every day 
but Sunday; the limbs turned out to 
have never been alive — yet, to 



satisfy the bullying police commis- 
sioner and the panicked public, a 
murderer had to be found. The hero 
took the last experiment, an almost 
but not quite complete body from 
the vat, dressed it, took it through 
the cordon in a hearse, wrote a 
suicide note for the corpse that had 
never lived, shot it, and the result- 
ing scoop built up the commissioner 
for a shoo-in as governor. 

Funny how awful an sf story 
sounds when condensed. I re- 
member being backed into describ- 
ing one at a party: ‘‘There are these 
giant brains in glassite domes in the 
Arctic, and they belong to aliens 
who know the entire history of the 
Earth because they’re immortal — ” 
The process was so embarrassing 
that I never did write that story. 

I was shuffling through the rain 
one day toward Street & Smith 
without an idea in my head except a 
subvocal song about walk- 
ing . No, wait a minute. I have 
to tell you how come I started writ- 
ing under my own name. After my 
turndown for Des Hall’s Job, along 
came a man named Stanley G. 
Weinbaum, with the most marvel- 
ously invented yarns about the most 
lovable Martians and things that 
readers loved so much that S&S had 
to drop its anti-Semitism. John 
Campbell also put me on a first- 
name basis and told me to use my 
name, which I very thankfully did. 

So, as I was saying, I was shuf- 
fling through the rain and there was 
this song I was subvocalizing about

walking between the raindrops 
. hey, how about that for a 
story! I had it half worked out by 
the time I reached John’s office — 
only, after I hit him with it, he ve- 
toed inverted ionization as the reason 
water wouldn’t touch my hero. He 
wanted a pure fantasy with maybe a 
water gnome to put a curse on the 
protagonist. Now why would he 
want a fantasy when he’s putting 
out an sf magazine? Well, that was 
his business, not mine. All right, a 
supernatural curse. But why? And 
how is it gotten rid of? 

I wrote it, finally, as “Trouble 
With Water’’ and found myself 
famous. But why did Campbell 
want fantasy? Because he needed 
stories for his new magazine, Un- 
krwvm, and I was in the first issue! 

You can’t imagine the impact 
Unknown had on writers. I, for one, 
dropped science fiction and joyfully 
turned out fantasies — nothing but 
fantasies — for the next two years. 
They included “Warm, Dark 
Places,” “Day Off,” and the biggest 
hit of all, a novel called “None 
But Lucifer.” 

Well, 1 finally wrote a short sf 
story in between fantasies and tried 
it out on John. He wanted fantasies 
from me. So I gave it to Mort 
Weisinger, editor of Thrilling Won- 
der. It was about the first man to 
land on Mars, such a complete heel 
and opportunist, wanting to turn his 
fame into money, that the equiva- 
lent of NASA fired him off to Mars 
again, to get rid of him. Mort, 

FORUM 



never one to leave well enough 
alone, wanted it turned into a tear- 
jerker, so I wrote a four- 
handkerchief story called, simply 
enough, “Hero.” It was a stinker, a 
real bummer, but it sold — and it got 
Mort to sell me to the publisher of 
Thrilling Stories as Mort’s assistant. 
My first editorial job! How about 
that? 

I’ll tell you how about that. It 
paid $30 a week, which wasn’t 
quite enough to support a wife, and 
20 days after Pearl Harbor, a child, 
and it was so mechanical that two 
years of it destroyed the pleasure of 
editing. I had come to it with the 
most exalted feeling of exaltation, 
and left it with style and pride com- 
pletely gone. 

I went next to setting up, as 
managing editor, a pair of true de- 
tective magazines, then resigned to 
write a million words a year for 
these and other such magazines. It got 
so I couldn’t look another rape in 
the face. So I turned to comic 
books, writing as many as four 
scripts a week. Now THAT paid! 
And so did radio. I was on my way 
to the top — and I got drafted. 

I spent a couple of years in the 
Pacific as a combat engineer, and 
when I got out, the markets were 
gone. 

* * * 

It was 1946, and I still had the 
same wife and son, and I couldn’t 
get back to writing. So I had to find 
something else. It turned out to be 

25 




exporting rebuilt bookbinding 
machinery. I knew as little about 
them as I had engineering, which 
was zero, except for pushing and 
pulling and hauling pieces of 
bridges together, and road 
grading — from the position of 
D-handle operator. I made a lot of 
money in the bookbinding business 
before it dried up. 

By that time, I was ready to go 
back to writing. But what? Un- 
known had folded, and I didn’t want 
to go back to sf for the very reason 
Des Hall had spelled out — it was 
too much work for too little dough. 
So I turned again to the comic 
books and soon worked my way up 
to the highest-paid writer in the 
field — and collapsed. I did, not the 
field. 

I was doing my best to recover 
when a girl who had worked for me 
called me in to present a publishing 
program to a French-Italian publish- 
ing firm, named, in translation. 
World Editions. 

It seems they had a big slick 
magazine in France and Italy that 
was selling two or three million 
copies a week. A cross between 
beautifully executed comics and 
confession stories, less beautifully 
executed, it was dubbed Fascination 
and set loose on the American pub- 
lic with a huge advertising program. 
There were five issues — the last 
sold 5% of its print order of several 
hundred thousand, or was it a mil- 
lion? I forget; Anyhow, they were 
too stubborn to get out of the 

26 



American market with such a beat- 
ing, and so I was asked to submit a 
publishing program. 

I surveyed the entire magazine 
market. It was early 1950, and 
everywhere I looked, magazines 
were in deep trouble. As soon as 
paper rationing had ended in 1946, 
everyone who could read — or could 
hire someone to read — was putting 
out everything from comics to fash- 
ion magazines. The one exception 
was science fiction. 

On the basis of experience, I 
should have submitted anything but 
an sf magazine, a fantasy magazine 
projected for later, once the sf one 
was established, and a series of 
paperback sf novels. But I saw that 
Astounding was going off into one 
cult after another — John Campbell 
was rushing up dead ends, the latest 
being Dianetics, in his search for a 
meaningful universe — and Fantasy 
& Science Fiction was brand new, 
and flying in the face of the single 
immutable law of those fields: that 
readers don’t like fantasy in their sf, 
or sf in their fantasy. A very high- 
grade sf magazine could fit right be- 
tween them. And thus I offered my 
publishing program to the Italian 
representative of World Editions, a 
great guy named Lombi. He offered 
it to the publisher who lived on the 
Riviera, who must have flipped a 
coin, because neither he nor Lombi 
knew anything at all about sf or fan- 
tasy, and it came up yes. 

I gave them a choice between 
Galaxy and If. I liked both titles, 

GALAXY 




but I left the decision to Lombi and 
his boss on the Riviera. They, in 
turn, didn’t know what a “galaxy” 
was, and If seemed to them too 
short, and they left the choice to 
me. So I and our art director, 
Washington Irving van der Poel 
(Van for short), talked over possible 
cover layouts — and my present 
wife’s (Nicky’s) first husband, a 
great calligrapher, designed the let- 
tering. Harry Harrison lent us his 
apartment to display the many varia- 
tions of both Galaxy and If, which 
a large number of people, including 
writers, artists, and readers, were 
asked to vote on. 

Curiously, almost all wrote on 
their secret ballots that they person- 
ally liked Galaxy and an inverted-L 
layout, but each thought nobody 
else would. That was good enough 
for us — Galaxy it was and the 
inverted-L layout won. So did 
Crome-Kote, the closest printing 
paper to photographic glossies, 
which I had asked for pretty ur- 
gently for our cover stock. Despite 
its high cost and difficulty of han- 
dling, I got what I asked for. 

The fact is that I got every single 
thing I wanted, from word rates to 
rights. The going rate was a top of 
two cents a word — I got the price 
up to three cents minimum, four 
cents or more for steady con- 
tributors, plus $100 for short-shorts. 
And we bought first-serial rights on- 
ly- 

Suddenly, writers and artists of- 
fered us everything they were turn- 

FORUM 



ing out, and many of the greats 
came out of retirement to join us. It 
was a wonderful time to be alive 
and editing Galaxy. And in the un- 
believable space of five issues. 
Galaxy was in the black! 

* * * 

Just in case you think I’m 
paranoid about being an historical 
Typhoid Mary, consider this — only 
months after Galaxy was born, the 
Korean War started. 

And paper became impossible to 
buy at any price. Our printer had 
set us up with a mill — or so we 
thought. It turned out he had the 
contract, not us, and we were 
forced to look elsewhere. I went 
through the yellow pages and called 
every printer 1 found, asking if we 
could hook up with thetn. The only 
one who said yes was a printing 
broker named Robert M. Guinn, 
who had followed Galaxy's as- 
tonishing rise toward first place 
with considerable awe. 

The paper was more like a blotter 
than newsprint, but we missed only 
one issue in switching printers. And 
we cable to be great friends with 
Bob Guinn, of which more later. 

Now back to Lombi. He was in 
the U.S. on a visitor’s visa, not al- 
lowed to work here or be paid by 
Galaxy. One day he was called 
down to Washington by the Immi- 
gration Department and shown all of 
a letter but the signature — which 
stated that he was a dirty Italian 
communistic fascist who ought to 

27 




be sent back where he came from. 
Affidavits and appeals failed. He 
was sent back to Italy, his visa 
withdrawn. 

I still don’t know who sent that 
letter, but it’s no coincidence that as 
soon as Lombi was out of the coun- 
try, internal warfare developed be- 
tween the American, French and Ital- 
ian offices of World Editions. We 
had an ex-music publisher as presi- 
dent of the American office, who 
had been hired just as he was about 
to lock his door and declare bank- 
ruptcy, and a circulation director. I 
had told Lombi at the outset to call 
in all unsold copies of Galaxy's first 
year — and the president and the cir- 
culation manager got hold of them 
and stuffed their garages with these 
soon-to-be-priceless copies of the 
magazine. Then strange things hap- 
pened to our sales. Readers wrote in 
that they couldn’t find us on any 
newsstand anywhere. 

The upshot was that the Riviera 
guy sent the head of the French of- 
fice to New York to find out what 
went wrong. To make a short story 
of all this, the Frenchman cabled 
back to the Riviera that the 
magazine was a dud and should 
immediately be sold — to the Ameri- 
can president and the circulation di- 
rector, and their price was $3,000. I 
got in touch hurriedly with Lombi 
and told him of this. The time in 
Rome was 4:30 a.m., but Lombi 
got up and raced to the Riviera. The 
publisher instantly sent a cable 
stopping negotiations and followed 

28 



up with another visit by Lombi to 
take care of the matter. 

I was told by the two American 
scoundrels that I was part of the 
deal, but I wasn’t having any. Lombi 
arrived by plane and we began look- 
ing for a better buyer. A number of 
outfits here were interested, but, as 
I said, we were becoming great 
friends with the printing broker. 
Bob Guinn, and I got him to make 
a bid. I don’t know how much, but 
Lombi made the sale with the Rivi- 
era man’s blessing — and no sooner 
had Guinn bought it than the inside 
job became clear to Lombi. The dis- 
tribution pattern had been deliber- 
ately loused up — by shipping 
Galaxy all over the South, where 
there was practically nobody in- 
terested in sf, and into hamlets all 
over the North and West. 

Lombi called his boss and told 
him of this sabotage, and the boss 
told Lombi fo buy back the 
magazine from Guinn. Guinn gave 
him his price. Lombi was aghast — 
but this is four times as much as 
you paid! Guinn grinned and told 
him he, Guinn, knew what he was 
buying, whereas World Editions 
hadn’t known what they were sell- 
ing. Lombi went home, but not in 
dishonor. I hated to see him go. 
We’d had a fine relationship. 

But Bob Guinn was equally good 
to work for. He left policy deci- 
sions and rates up to me, and in- 
volved me in distribution and adver- 
tising problems. 1 mention advertis- 
ing because once World Editions 

GALAXY 




had, over my protests, run a back 
cover ad for a book called “Confes- 
sions of a French Chambermaid” 
and we’d lost 10,000 readers for the 
three months of the contract. 
Galaxy went to the top of the field 
after that, never to lose ground. 

And then came Beyond Fantasy 
Fiction. It was beautiful — for ten 
wonderful issues. By then we had 
learned that there just wasn’t a big 
enough audience to support a fan- 
tasy magazine, so it died just as 
Unknown had, a decade before, of 
financial malnutrition. If Beyond 
had come first, I think it would 
have had the same effect and same 
misty memories as Unknown. 

After we had vacated the title If 
in 1950, Jim Quinn put it out, but 
couldn’t keep it going. And so I got 
both titles to edit. This was more 
than an extra job for me — it enabled 
me to buy stories that weren’t 
Galaxy standard and thus keep writ- 
ers happy, as well as giving me the 
chance I’d never before had of 
bringing new ones up to Galaxy. 

As for the Galaxy sf novel 
reprints — they weren’t handled right 
as packages, being more like num- 
bered magazines than paperbacks. I 
got that go-ahead just as the paper- 
back market broke, but it was too 
late. 

All this was from 1950 to 1961, 
eleven memorable years. What hap- 
pened to me then? I had been in a 
disastrous car crash that finally 
wore me down to 126 pounds and 
eventually into the hospital with a 

FORUM 



poor chance of my ever being able 
to walk again. I was there for a 
long time, till my weight was back 
to normal and the crippling cured. 

So, if you remember, I 
remarried — and the big buildup 
came to South Vietnam. Then I 
bought my very first house — and 
the Six Day War happened. 

* * * 

You know, things like that sober 
a guy. It’s only part of the reason I 
would never go back to editing 
magazines again. The other part is 
that you have to be 25 years 
younger than I am now, with 
enough enthusiasm to get excited 
over a fresh idea, a fine bit of 
characterization, a new view of 
something old — and the vigor to 
push and pull until you and a writer 
and a story all click. 

Jim Baen has all that. Galaxy is 
safe in his hands, and solidly estab- 
lished enough, and fresh and re- 
freshing enough, to endure at least 
another quarter of a century, who- 
ever runs it. 

No, I wouldn’t take a million 
cruzeiros for the memories I have of 
the writers and readers and great 
stories I encountered in those eleven 
years I served. That took some do- 
ing. And nothing could induce me 
to do it again. 

It wouldn’t be safe for the world, 
would it? 

Meanwhile, happy 25th anniver- 
sary, Galaxy \ 

And long life to you! ★

The one irremediable 
flaw is — perfection! 



F ROM WHERE HE LAY in the ham- 
mock on the porch Munro could 
take in a goodly portion of the uni- 
verse without so much as having to 
raise his head. Simply by opening 
one eye he could see down the hill 
to the ocean and across the waves 
to the horizon. From that point it 
was only a matter of shifting his 
gaze upward a degree or two to ob- 
serve a broad expanse of velvet sky 
decorated with innumerable stars. 
Although he was used to seeing this 
brilliant spectacle every night, he 
seemed always to have the same 
impression: in a dark room he 
peered down at a dark cloth, when 
suddenly a merchant dashed a hand- 
ful of blazing diamonds onto the 
velvet. 

Munro lazily opened one eye. 
Yes, the night fitted that description 
very well. And even now one star 
was tumbling, as it were, across the 
velvet sky in an exciting arc. 

He sat up. Was it going to land 
in the sea? 

The falling light was eclipsed by 
a palm. 



Munro rubbed his eyes. 
“Must’ve been dreaming,” he de- 
clared, glancing at the luminous dial 
of his watch. 

Ten. 

Early yet. 

He yawned. Could still put in 
several hours work. He swung his 
bare feet to the matted floor. Work 
was what he had isolated himself on 
this island in the south Pacific for. 

He stood, stretched. Funny how 
even the best laid plans went astray. 
It was one thing to decide a tropical 
isle cut off from the world was the 
right place to work. Easy to make 
such a decision when you were sit- 
ting in a stuffy office in Cambridge 
looking out through a dirty window 
at snow turned yellow-gray by in- 
dustrial smoke. 

So you make the arrangements, 
cut the redtape, inform the Depart- 
ment. Their reaction was so intense 
you would’ve thought you were a 
mass murderer making a successful 
esc^ie. 

Of course, they were justified. Be 
a shame if they lost the first man 
who had been to Mars and lived to 
tell about it. And so a compromise 
was worked out. You gave them ten 
days — two hundred and forty 
hours — of your life. They pumped 
you full of bug-juice, and pumped it 
out again in the form of answers to 
their questions. The process was 
painless. You slept like the dead 
through it all and awoke, finally, 
feeling as though a burden had been 
removed. 



31 




He gave them enough data to 
keep the entire staff busy for years. 
Then, with the Department’s bless- 
ing, he made his journey via navy 
plane and ship to Boratonga. Others 
in the program had been here before 
him, men from the moon missions, 
and even Craig, the captain who 
circled Venus and later went mad 
and killed himself. 

The government owned the island 
and maintained it in its timeless 
natural form. The houses were 
made by the native population of 
bamboo and palm thatch. There was 
no electricity, no running water. 
You worked by sunlight or 
lamplight, and you bathed either in 
the sea or in the icy stream flow- 
ing from the hills. 

Munro looked back one last time 
at the ocean and the night sky, then 
went inside and lit the lamp on his 
work table. The sheet of paper in 
the portable typewriter nagged him 
to get back to work. He glanced at 
the paragraph he’d been writing. 
Had broken off in mid-sentence 
when Luana called him to eat. Sub- 
ject was his reaction to the desolate 
Martian landscape. 

Munro drew a deep breath and 
tasted the fragrant tropical air. Up 
there on the Red Planet the only 
taste was mechanical. Man wasn’t 
made for blandness. Why, even the 
Eskimo delighted in odor, in color, 
in feeling. 

Munro heard a rustling behind 
him. Without turning he said, 
“Luana?” 

32 



A soft voice replied, “Moon rise. 
You come and we go swim in la- 
goon. You like?” 

Munro liked very much. He tore 
the page from the typewriter and 
tossed it in the crate serving as 
waste basket. Tomorrow was soon 
enough to deal with Martian impres- 
sions. He blew out the lamp and 
followed the native girl down the 
path through the hibiscus and jas- 
mine. The wind in the palm 
sounded like rain, but the night was 
clear and the moon was above the 
horizon. 

The only reminder of civilization 
was the occasional sad baying of a 
dog in the village a half mile away. 

« ★ 

Rays of sun. Stars. The moon, 
green and red. 

Munro blinked. The morning sun- 
light streamed through the trees and 
fell slanting through the window be- 
side the mat upon which he and 
Luana slept. The rays, stars, and 
moon he fancied he saw were famil- 
iar objects — a spider and its web, 
festooned with sparkling droplets of 
dew. 

Munro reached out and touched 
the sleeping Luana’s hair — then 
looked back at the window opening 
again. There was another spider and 
web in the upper left portion. The 
spiders were identically ma±ed in 
red and green. 

Nothing uncommon about that. 
Creatures of the same species 
looked alike. Be strange if they 

GALAXY 




didn’t. Only it was the first time 
Munro remembered seeing two 
working webs in the same window. 

Luana rose, and they bathed in 
the cold stream. Afterward she pre- 
pared something to eat while Munro 
looked over the pages he had been 
working on the day before. 

Not much had been ac- 
complished. He wondered if the 
bug-juice had dulled his memory by 
exposing all his factual knowledge. 
What he was searching after now 
was his human response to the Mars 
voyage, his feelings, his joys and 
fears. 

“The colors are muted,’’ he read, 
“reminiscent of nothing so much 
perhaps as the beginning riff of a 
sax-man in a smoky nightclub.’’ 

Well, that wasn’t too baci. In 
fact, the Martian landscape was that 
way, to him at least. Like a sad 
song, like the blues, like something 
full and bursting was buried just be- 
low the grim surface. 

Luana’s big yellow cat brushed 
against Munro’s bare leg. He ab- 
sently spoke to the friendly crea- 
ture, then bent and stroked its blunt 
head. And when he looked up from 
the page he noticed another cat — 
big and yellow, marked 
identically — resting atop the refer- 
ence books stacked on a mat in the 
corner. 

One cat was almost one too 
many. “Luana!” he called. “Come 
here.” 

“Yes?” She came in carrying a 
platter of colorful fruits. 

THE END RESULT 



“The cat, Ilo, you didn’t say he 
had a brother.” 

She glanced at the cat in the 
corner. “I did not know.” She 
smiled. “But Ilo is one big fellow 
who love all over Boratonga. He 
has many sons.” 

“Just like him?” Munro won- 
dered. “But never mind. Shoo that 
fellow out. One cat is plenty.” 

“Okay, then we eat, and then we 
go beach side? Nice morning.” 

“No, you go beach side. Me, 
I’ve got to work.” 

“Always work, work, work.” 
She took a red flower from atop the 
fruit and placed it behind her ear. 
Then took another, a yellow hibis- 
cus, and stuck it in the front of 
Munro’s shirt. 

“Now you pretty, me pretty, fruit 
pretty, everything pretty — cat gone. 
We eat, okay?” 

* * * 

They ate. And the morning was 
so fresh and lovely that Munro de- 
cided surely an hour more or less 
wouldn’t matter. So they went to 
the beach. As they came out of the 
house and passed the window, he 
noticed that one of the spiders was 
missing. Web and all. A bird no 
doubt had swooped down and had 
his breakfast. 

What was one spider in the 
scheme of things, anyhow? 

The clear blue water took his 
mind off of life and death. For a

time he and Luana drifted on the 
waves and dove down to the bottom 
to bring up colorful shells. Then 
they swam through clouds of bright 
fish to the shore, shook the water 
from their skin, found their gar- 
ments, and started back to the 
house. 

Tomi, the ancient gray dog that 
prowled the beach for dead fish, 
trailed them, and behind him sev- 
eral feet, moving like his thin 
shadow, was a second Tomi. 

Luana noticed the similarity. 
“There are two of Tomi, yes?” 

Munroe examined the two ani- 
mals. They were indeed identical. 

Munro held out his hand and 
made a friendly kissing sound with 
his lips. Tomi waddled forward. 
The second dog moved too. Munro 
stopped, found a small coconut, and 
flung it at Tomi’s twin. It struck 
him on the head, but the dog did 
not move. 

Tomi barked and the other dog 
backed off into the jungle. 

“This island have many dogs,’’ 
said Luana. “Tomi old like Ilo.’’ 
She giggled. 

Munro smiled but he did not 
laugh. When he returned to the hut 
he checked the window very care- 
fully and was surprised to discover 
no trace at all of spider web in the 
comer where the second spider had 
been. 

He pondered this fact. Luana left 
him and went into the village to buy 
coffee and sugar at the small store. 
Munro perched on the upturned

crate he used as a chair when he 
typed and tried to focus his thoughts 
on the Martian landscape. 

“From the sky above,’’ he be- 
gan, “there is a promise you can 
almost taste, a hint of things straw- 
berry, cool, delicious. But when 
you step out into that faint atmos- 
phere, your head spins and you fear 
there is something wrong with your 
breathing equipment. But no, it 
functions. The fault is within your- 
self. It is found — .’’ 

His fingers hesitated, stopped on 
the cool keys. 

Found where? 

Munro yanked the sheet from the 
machine and crumpled it in a ball.. 
He strode to the window. The sun 
was almost overhead. Luana was 
coming back. 

“That was a quick trip,’’ he mut- 
tered. 

He watched her lilting gait, the 
way the sunlight shone in her jet 
hair. 

Her arms were empty. Strange? 
Where were the packages? The 
store wasn’t closed, never was. If 
owner Adams weren’t in, you took 
what you needed and settled up la- 
ter. 

She saw him. He smiled. She 
came several paces nearer, then 
quickly turned off into the jungle 
and was gone. 

“Now what?’’ Munro wondered. 

Some sort of game? She was 
childlike, but he couldn’t stop every 
five minutes and play! 

Then he felt her presence behind

him. Her hands touched him. “Me 
come back quick,” she whispered. 
“You glad?” 

They sank to the mat. Yes, he 
was glad. 

But he was also practical. The 
coffee, the sugar? 

She didn’t answer. 

. * ★ * 

Later, as the afternoon shadows 
filtered through the hut, Luana 
rose and darted down the path. 
Munro had just settled himself be- 
fore the typewriter when she reap- 
peared carrying several packages. 
She was singing an island song. Her 
happy voice called him out to meet 
her. 

“Adams, him send you this,” 
she said, giving him a cigar. “He 
say you smoke and be happy. No 
work too much. Be pretty, be hap- 
py! We go swim, yes?” 

Munro took the packages and fol- 
lowed her to the porch. What the 
devil, the day was shot anyhow! 
“Yes, we go swim,” he replied. 

* ★ * 

The lamp flickered as he moved 
the chimney and lit the cigar from 
the naked flame. Blue smoke dif- 
fused the pale yellow light and a 
trapped bug flew to his death when 
the glass dropped once again into 
place. 

Munro blew a ring of smoke. 



Luana clapped at his skill. He 
smiled and looked up at the sky. 
Same as the night before, and the 
night before that. Stars, planets, 
space. Soon the moon would crawl 
above the horizon. Mars was out 
there, too, glistening, red. 

Ilo came in from the jungle and 
leaped into Luana’s lap. She stroked 
his tawny fur. He curled up and 
purred himself to sleep. Tomi the 
dog came out of the shadows and 
found a place for the night by the 
edge of the proch. 

All was peaceful, quiet, on this 
tiny island world. 

And yet — . 

Munro puffed his cigar till the 
coal glowed like an angry eye and a 
layer of blue floated between him 
and the stars. 

The loose flesh on the back of his 
neck tingled. His scalp seemed to 
draw up slightly. 

He had a feeling — there was no 
other way to explain — that some- 
thing beyond the lamplight in the 
shadows of the jungle was observ- 
ing him. 

He held the lamp above his head 
and searched the increased circle of 
light. A pair of tropical birds roost- 
ing on a nearby branch blinked their 
huge eyes — at least Munro was cer- 
tain one of the pair blinked. The 
other turned away from the light. 

* * * 

He slept restlessly. Towards 
dawn Luana woke and whispered 



36 



GALAXY 




that today she must visit her mother’s 
hut which stood a mile on the 
other side of the village. Munro 
grunted and tried sleep again. He 
thought of his journey across space 
to Mars, of the days spent there in 
the sterile habitat, of the Martian 
miles he had explored, setting his 
foot where no earthling had trod, of 
the poetic spectacle of those two 
moons rising and setting in the thin 
atmosphere. 

For a time he napped. Then he 
woke and remained awake. His 
work waited on the table by the 
typewriter. Luana was gone and 
would not return before afternoon. 
He could get a lot done. 

Yes, but first. 

She had left a pot of coffee on 
the tiny stove. There was a tray of 
fresh fruit. Munro had a light break- 
fast and then went down to the sea 
for his morning dip. Tomi was there 
looking for his breakfast. His com- 
panion of the day before was 
nowhere to be seen. 

Munro gave the old dog an affec- 
tionate pat and plunged into the 
cool water. Clouds of red and yel- 
low fish rose round about him and 
pecked gently at his skin. 

He swam, he lazed, and then he 
came out, flung the water from his 
body best he could, slipped on his 
shorts, and went back to the hut, 
with every good intention of at last 
getting down to some real work. 

Yes, he would wrap this thing 
up. After all, what was so compli- 
cated about what he had to say? So 

THE END RESULT 



he was the only human — thus far — 
to visit another planet and survive. 
That in itself was no reason to sup- 
pose his emotional reactions would 
be any different from another per- 
son’s. Every human had pretty much 
the same basic response mechanism; 
the real difference was probably of 
degree. Poets looked for one sort of 
thing, engineers another. 

Munro laughed. “And everyone 
seems to find what he looks for!’’ 

This bit of native wisdom almost 
caused him to laugh again. But at 
that moment he heard a sound. It 
came from the direction of his hut. 
He stopped, cupped his hand behind 
his ear to be sure. Some of the 
birds were cunning mimics. 

No, this sound was authentic. It 
was the steady click-click of a 
typewriter. 

Luana couldn’t type; besides, 
she was gone. 

Someone from the Department 
must’ve come during the night. 
Yes, and they were working up one 
report or another, using his 
machine. That meant they’d proba- 
bly seen the pages he’d written. 

“Damn!” cried Munro. That was 
like reading another’s mail! 

Well, he’d put a quick stop to it! 

He ran up the path to the porch, 
then slowed and edged through the 
door. 

A man sat on the upturned crate 
before the typewriter. His fingers 
flew over the keys, but there was 
no paper in the machine. 

“Hi,” he said. 



37 




There was something about the 
fellow, about the slope of his 
shoulders, the color of his hair. 

He stopped typing and turned 
round. There was a wry smile on 
his tanned face. 

Munro’s heart raced. The man 
was Munro ! 

“I’ve been waiting. Don’t be 
alarmed.’’ 

“Who are you?’’ Munro finally 
managed to ask. 

“Why, you, of course,’’ came 
the laughing response. “No, not re- 
ally. Sit down. You look as though 
you might faint.’’ 

Munro sat on the mat flooring. 
He blinked and passed his hands be- 
fore his eyes, but when he looked 
again the stranger was still there. 

“Sorry to have frightened you,’’ 
his doppleganger continued. “You 
are in no danger.” 

Munro forced himself to be ob- 
jective, rational. Apparently, the 
shape before him did exist. Very 
well, get to the bottom of the mys- 
tery. 

He said, “Unless I’m hallucinat- 
ing, this is real. You are my twin. 
You—.” 

Twin? What about the spiders, 
cats, dogs, — even Luana. ? 

“I cannot know your thoughts di- 
rectly,” said the stranger. “How- 
ever, I can read them in your ex- 
pression.” 

“You can assume any shape?” 

“Yes. I was the other spider, the 
other Ilo and Tomi.” He grinned. 
“Luana, also.” 

38 



Munro felt color rise in his face. 

“Don’t be embarrassed,” said 
the stranger. “Your actions were 
natural, quite in keeping with your 
species.” 

“Yes, but there is such a thing as 
privacy!” 

“Not necessarily. Didn’t you 
examine everything that came your 
way on Mars?” 

“Yes, but that was scientific. Myl 
mission was to — .” 

Munro stopped in mid-sentence. 
Was this protean form telling him 
he too was on a scientiflc mission? 

“There is a parallel to our situa- 
tions. I too travel and observe, 
though for no ultimate purpose, at 
least none of which I am aware. 
Where I go I take on the form of 
the various living things I encoun- 
ter. Their strengths are mine, and 
their limitations.” 

“That’s why you started here as 
a spider?” 

“Yes, but actually I commenced 
much smaller. As I observed I dis- 
covered varying levels of intelli- 
gence. In order to communicate 
with you I had to become you.” He 
gestured to the reference books in 
the comer. “I scanned those also.” 

“How?” asked Munro. “I was 
gone less than an hour.” 

“The answer is in one of those 
volumes. Time is relative. A mo- 
ment for you may be an eon for 
me.” 

“Yes, but how do you change 
shapes?” 

The stranger frowned. “Now we

come to the crux of our problem. 
There are facts which I cannot ex- 
plain to you because you cannot un- 
derstand. You see, your species 
hasn’t yet reached a level to com- 
prehend. Our conversation is, there- 
fore, limited. But to give you a 
hint — your geneticists are working 
with a duplicating process they call 
cloning. Cloning is analogous to the 
method I use.” 

“All right,” said Munro, choking 
down an urge to yell, perh^s even 
to leap up and punch this whatever- 
it-was in the nose to see if it were 
real. “Can you tell me where 
you’re from, what you are?” 

“My origin is the same as yours, 
the universe. As with you, the mat- 
ter which is me has always been. 
But my — home — is far away, and my 
existence-span is quite beyond your 
grasp. I do not know if it is possi- 
ble for me to experience an ultimate 
end, or ‘death,’ to use your vo- 
cabulary. 

“Who am I? Again, the great dif- 
ferences between our states makes 
an answer almost impossible. In one 
of your books a theory of evolution 
is set forth. Working within that 
framework, I am the end result.” 

Munro came to his feet. “The 
end result? You? A shapeless some- 
thing? Is this — ” he waved his arms 
about, pointed out the window at 
the brilliant flowering trees “ — all 
this bound to come to your state?” 

“Yes. But why be so upset? Be- 
ing, as you say, Shape-/ej5, I have 
all shapes. You have been across a

narrow stream to a nearby planet. I 
have spanned oceans, galaxies.” 

“Yes, but why? Tell me why?” 

The stranger smiled and shook 
his head. “The answer to that ques- 
tion exists beyond the limits of my 
understanding, if it exists.” 

“But why are you here, speaking 
to me?” Munro demanded. 

“Why not?” 

Suddenly Munro’s frustration 
overwhelmed him. He leaped up 
and rushed the stranger, who side- 
stepped him and jumped out the 
window. 

“That’s rather foolish,” he said. 

“We’ll see about that when I 
catch you!” snarled Munro, Junp- 
ing through the same window. 

The stranger ran backwards down 
the path, laughing. 

Munro, more enraged than ever, 
pursued, and as he came near and 
reached out to grab him, a passing 
red and green butterfly suddenly be- 
came two butterflies, and Munro’s 
fingers captured empty air. 

The two insects flew off in differ- 
ent directions. 

Which was which? 

He watched them vanish into the 
jungle, then, after a while, turned 
and walked back to the hut. 

There was nothing left for him to 
do except try again to get back to 
work — and he would do just that, 
after a cup of coffee and a quick 
swim. Procrastination was part of 
the human condition. He found 
himself smiling. It was rather nice 
not to be perfect, yet. ★

policeman of some sort sitting at the 
desk of the Secretary to the Council 
of State. 

Tromp did not always disabuse 
them. 

Now his great left hand expanded 
over the grizzled fringe of hair re- 
maining at the base of his skull. 
“Tell me about the ambush,” he 
directed. 

“He didn’t make any trouble 
about coming to you here at the 
port,” Stilchey said, for a moment 
watching his fingers writhe together 
rather than look at his superior . He 
glanced up. “Have you met Ham- 
mer?” 

“No, I kept in the background 
when plans for the Auxilliary Reg- 
iment were drafted. I’ve seen his 
picture, of course.” 

“Not the same,” the captain re- 
plied, beginning to talk very quick- 
ly. “He’s not big but he, he moves, 
he’s alive and it’s like every time 
he speaks he’s training a gun on 
you, waiting for you to slip. But he 
came along, no trouble — only he 
said we’d go with a platoon of 
combat cars instead of flying back, 
he wanted to check road security 
between Southport and the firebase 
where we were. I said sure, a 
couple hours wasn’t crucial. ...” 

Tromp nodded. “Well done,” he 
said. “Hammer’s cooperation is 
very important if this . business 
is to be concluded smoothly. 
And,” — here the councillor’s face 
hardened without any noticeable 
shift of muscles — “the last thing we 

42 



wanted was for the good colonel to 
become concerned while he was 
still with his troops. He is not a 
stupid man.” 

Gratification played about the 
edges of Stilchey’s mouth, but the 
conversation had cycled the cap- 
tain’s mind back closer to the blast 
of cyan fire. His stomach began to 
spin. “There were about fifteen 
vehicles in the patrol, all but the 
second one open combat cars. That 
was a command car, same chassis 
and ground-effect curtain, but en- 
closed, you see? Better commo gear 
and an air-conditioned passenger 
compartment. I started toward it but 
Hammer said, no, I was to get in 
the next one with him and 
Joachim.” 

Stilchey coughed, halted. “That 
Joachim’s here with him now; he 
calls him his aide. The bastard’s 
queer, he tried to make me when I 
flew out. ...” 

Puzzlement. “Colonel Hammer is 
homosexual. Captain? Or his aide, 
or. ?” 

“No, Via! Him, not the — I don’t 
know. Via, maybe him too. The 
bastard scares me, he really does.” 

To statesmen patience is a tool; it 
is a palpable thing that can grind 
necessary information out of a 
young man whose aristocratic 
lineage and sparkling uniform have 
suddenly ceased to armor him 
against the universe. The ambush. 
Captain.” Tromp pressed stolidly. 

With a visible effort, Stilchey re- 
gained the thread of his narrative. 



GALAXY 




“Joachim drove. Hammer and I 
were in the back along with a non- 
com from Curwin — Worzer, his 
name was. He and Joachim threw 
dice for who had to drive. The road 
was supposed to be clear but Ham- 
mer made me put on body armor. 1 
thought it was cop, you know — 
make the staffer get hot and dusty. 

“Via,” he swore again, but 
softly this time. “1 was at the left- 
side powergun but I wasn’t paying 
much attention; nothing really to 
pay attention to. Hammer was on 
the radio a lot, but my helmet only 
had intercom so 1 didn’t know what 
he was saying. The road was 
stabilized earth, just a gray line 
through hectares of those funny blue 
plants you see all over here, the 
ones with the fat leaves.” 

“Bluebrights,” the older man 
said dryly. “Melpomone’s only ex- 
port; as you would know from the 
briefing cubes you were issued in 
transit, I should think.” 

“Would the Lord I’d never heard 
of this damned place!” Stilchey 
blazed back. His family controlled 
Karob Trading; no civil servant — 
not even Tromp, the Gray Emi- 
nenee behind the Congress of the 
Republic — could cow him. But he 
was a soldier, too, and after a mo- 
ment he continued, “Bluebrights in 
rows, waist high and ugly, and 
beyond that nothing but the soil 
blowing away as we passed. 

“We were half an hour out from 
the firebase, maybe half the way to 
here. The ground was dimpled with 

BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



frost heaves. A little copse was in 
sight ahead of us, trees ten, fifteen 
meters high. Hammer had the for- 
ward gun, and on the intercom he 
said, ‘Want to double the bet, Black- 
ie?’ Then they armed their guns — 1 
didn’t know why — and Worzer said, 
‘1 still think they’ll be in the draw 
two kays south, but 1 won’t take 
any more of your money.’ They 
were laughing and 1 thought they 
were going to Just . elear the 
guns, you know?” 

The captain closed his eyes. He 
remembered how they had stared at 
him, two bulging circles and the 
hollow of his screaming mouth be- 
low them, reflected on the polished 
floorplate of the combat car. “The 
command car blew up just as we 
entered the trees. There was a flash 
like the siin and it ate the back half 
of the ear, armor and all. The front 
flipped over and over into the trees, 
and the air stank with metal. 
Joachim laid us sideways to follow 
the part the mine had left, cutting in 
right behind when it hit a tree and 
stopped. The driver raised his head 
out of the hatch and maybe he 
could have got elear him- 
self . but Hammer jumped off 
our deck to his and jerked him out, 
yanked him up in his armor as 
small as he is. Then they were back 
in our car. They were firing, every- 
body was firing, and we turned 
right, into the trees, into the guns.” 
“There were Mel troops in the 
grove, then?” Tromp asked. 

“Must have been,” Stilchey re- 

43 




plied. He looked straight at the 
older man and said, very simply, “I 
was behind the bulkhead. Maybe if 
I’d known what to expect. .The 
other driver was at my gun, they 
didn’t need me.” Stilchey swal- 
lowed once, continued, ‘‘Some 
shots hit on my side. They didn’t 
come through, but they made the 
whole car ring. The empties kept 
spattering me and the car was 
bouncing, jumping downed trees. 
Everything seemed to be on fire. 
We cleared the grove into another 
field of bluebrights. Shells from the 
firebase were already landing in the 
trees; the place was targeted. And 
Worzer pulled off his helmet and he 
spat and said, ‘Cold meat. Colonel, 
you couldn’t a called it better.’ 
Via!” 

‘‘Well, it does sound like they 
reacted well to the ambush,” 
Tromp admitted, puzzled because 
nothing Stilchey had told him 
explained the captain’s fear and 
hatred of Hammer and his men. 

‘‘Nice extempore response, 
hey?” the aide suggested with bitter 
irony. ‘‘Only Hammer, seeing I 
didn’t know what Worzer meant, 
turned to me, and said, ‘We let the 
Mels get word that me and Secre- 
tary Tromp would take a convoy to 
Southport this morning. They still 
had fifty or so regulars here in Re- 
gion 4 claiming to be an infantry bat- 
talion, and it looked like a good 
time to flush them for good and 
all.’ ” 

Tromp said nothing. He spread 

44 



his hands carefully on the citron- 
yellow of his desk top and seemed 
to be fixedly studying the contrast. 
Stilchey waited for a response. At 
last he said, ‘‘I don’t like being 
used for bait, Secretary. ‘‘And what 
if you’d decided to go out to the 
firebase yourself? I was all right for 
a stand-in, but do you think Ham- 
mer would have cared if you were 
there in person? He won’t let any- 
thing stand in his way.” 

‘‘Colonel Hammer does seem to 
have some unconventional attitudes, ’ ’ 
Tromp agreed. A bleak smile edged 
his voice as he continued, ‘‘But at 
that, it’s rather fortunate that he 
brought a platoon in with him. We 
can begin the demobilization of his 
vaunted Slammers with them.”

The dome of the Starport Lounge 
capped Southport’s hundred-meter 
hotel tower. Its vitril panels were 
seamless and of the same refractive 
index as the atmosphere. As a tacti- 
cian, Hammer was fascinated with 
the view; it swept beyond the 
equipment-thronged spaceport and 
over the shimmering billows of 
bluebright, to the mountains of the 
Crescent almost twenty kilometers 
away. But tankers’ blood has in it a 
turtle component that is more com- 
fortable on the ground than above 
it, and the little officer felt claws on 
his intestines as he looked out. 

No similar discomfort seemed to 
be disturbing the other men in the 
room, all in the black and silver of 

GAIAXY 




the Guards of the Republic, though 
in name they were armor officers. 
“Had a bit of action today, Col- 
onel?” said a cheerful, fit-looking 
major. Hammer did not remember 
him even though a year ago he had 
been Second in Command of the 
Guards. 

“Umm, a skirmish,” Hammer 
said as he turned. The Guardsman 
held out to him one of the two 
thimble-sized crystals he carried. In 
the heart of each flickered an azure 
fire. “Why, thank you — ” the 
major’s name was patterned in the 
silver highlights below his left 
lapel — ‘ ‘ Mestern . ’ ’ 

“No doubt you have seen much 
worse with your mercenaries, eh 
Colonel?” a voice called mockingly 
from across the room. 

Karl August Raeder lounged in 
imperial state in the midst of a doz- 
en admiring junior officers. He had 
been the executive officer of the 
Guards for the past year — ever since 
Hammer took command of the 
foreign regiment raised to smash the 
scattered units of the Army of Mel- 
pomone. 

“Mercenaries, Karl?” Hammer 
repeated. A threat rasped through 
the surface mildness of his tone. 
“Yes, they cash their paychecks. 
There may be a few others in this 
room who do, hey?” 

“Oh. ,” someone murmured 
in the sudden quiet, but there was 
no way to tell what he meant by it. 
Raeder did not move. The blood 
had drawn back to yellow his 

BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



smooth tan, and where the cushions 
had borne his languid hands they 
now were dimpled cruelly. Two 
men in the lounge had reached of- 
ficer status in the Guards without 
enormous family wealth behind 
them. Hammer was one, Raeder 
was the other. 

He strained at a breath. In build, 
he and Hammer were not dissimilar: 
the latter brown-haired and some- 
what shorter, a trifle more of the 
hourglass in his shoulders and 
waist; Raeder blond and trim, slen- 
der in a rapier sort of way and quite 
as deadly. His uniform of natural 
silk and leather was in odd contrast 
to Hammer’s khaki battledress, but 
there was nothing of fop or sloven 
in either man. 

“Pardon,” the Guardsman said, 
“I would not have thought this a 
company in which one need explain 
patriotism; there are men who fight 
for their homelands, and then there 
are the dregs, the gutter-sweepings 
of a galaxy, who fight for the same 
reason they pimped and sold them- 
selves before our government — let 
me finish, please!” (though only 
Hammer’s smile had moved) “ — 
misguidedly, I submit, offered them 
more money to do what Frieland 
citizens could have done better!” 

“My boys are better citizens than 
some born on Frieland who stayed 
there wiping their butts — ” 

“A soldier goes where he is or- 
dered!” Raeder was standing. 

“A soldier — ” 

Dead silence. Hammer’s sentence 

45 




broke like an axed cord. He looked 
about the lounge at the twenty-odd 
men, most of them his ex-comrades 
and all, like Raeder, men who had 
thought him mad to post out of the 
Guards for the sake of a combat 
command. Hammer laughed. He in- 
verted the stim cone on the inside 
of his wrist and said approvingly, 
“Quite a view from up here. If it 
weren’t such a good target, you 
could make it your operations cen- 
ter.’’ As if in the midst of a normal 
conversation, he faced back toward 
the exterior and added, “By the 
way, what sort of operations are 
you expecting? I would have said 
the fighting here was pretty well 
over, and I’d be surprised at the 
government sending the Guards in 
for garrison duty.’’ 

The whispering that had begun 
when Hammer turned was stilled 
again. It was Raeder who cleared 
his throat and said in a tone be- 
tween triumph and embarrassment, 
“Col Rijsdal may know. He ... he 
has remained in his quarters since 
we landed.’’ Rijsdal had not had a 
sober day in the past three years 
since he had acceded to an enor- 
mous estate on Frieland. “No doubt 
we are to provide proper, ah, 
background for such official pro- 
nouncements as the Secretary will 
make to the populace.” 

Hammer nodded absently as if he 
believed the black and silver of a 
parade regiment would overawe the 
Mels more effectively than could 
his own scarred killers, the men 

46 



who had rammed Frieland suze- 
rainty down Mel throats after twelve 
regiments of regulars had tried and 
failed. But the Guards were impres- 
sively equipped . and all their 
gear had been landed. 

Five hundred worlds had im- 
ported bluebright leaves, with most 
of the tonnage moving through 
Southport. The handful of Frisian 
vessels scattered on the field looked 
lost, but traffic would pick up now 
that danger was over. For the mo- 
ment, hundreds of Guard vehicles 
gave it a specious life. In the broad 
wedge of his vision Hammer could 
see two rocket batteries positioned 
as neatly as chess pieces on the 
huge playing surface. The center of 
each cluster was an ammunition 
hauler, low and broad-chassied. 
Within its thin armor sheetings were 
the racks of 150 mm shells; every- 
thing from armor-piercing rounds 
with a second stage to accelerate 
them before impact, to antiperson- 
nel cases loaded with hundreds of 
separate bomblets. The haulers 
rested on the field; no attempt had 
been made to dig them in. 

The six howitzers of each battery 
were sited about their munitions in 
a regular hexagon, each joined to 
the hauler by the narrow strip of a 
conveyor. In action the hogs could 
kick out shells at five-second inter- 
vals, so the basic load of twenty 
rounds carried by the howitzer itself 
needed instant replenishment from 
the hauler’s store. Their stubby 
gun-tubes gave them guidance and 

GALAXY 




an initial boost, but most of the ac- 
celeration came beyond the muzzle. 
They looked grim and effective; 
still, it nagged Hammer to see that 
nobody had bothered to defilade 
them. 

“A pretty sight,” said Mestern. 
Conversation in the lounge was 
back to a normal level. 

Hammer squeezed the last of his 
stim cone into the veins of his 
wrist and let the cool shudder pass 
through him before saying, “The 
Republic buys the best, and that’s 
the only way to go when a battle’s 
hanging on it. Not that you don’t 
need good crews to man the gear.” 

Mestern pointed beyond the how- 
itzers toward a wide-spaced ring of 
gun trucks. “Latest thing in arty de- 
fense,” he said. “Each of those 
cars mounts an eight-barrel power- 
gun, only 30 mm but they’re high- 
intensity. They’ve got curst near the 
range of a tank’s 200 — thirty, forty 
kilometers if you’ve that long a 
sight line. With our radar hook-up 
and the satellite, we can just about 
detonate a shell as soon as it comes 
over the horizon.” 

“Nice theory,” Hammer agreed. 
“1 doubt you can swing the rig fast 
enough to catch the first salvo, but 
maybe placing them every ten de- 
grees like that . where you’ve 
got the terrain to allow it. The Mels 
never had arty worth cop anyway, 
of course.” 

He paused, not sure he wanted to 
comment further. The grounded 
tanks and combat cars of the regi- 

BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



ment were in an even perimeter at 
the edge of the circular field. Their 
dull iridium armor was in evident 
contrast to the ocher soil on which 
they rested. “You really ought to 
have dug in,” Hammer said at last. 

“Oh, the field’s been stabilized 
to two meters down,” the major 
protested innocently, “and I don’t 
think the Mels are much of a threat 
now.” 

Hammer shook his head in irrita- 
tion. “Lord!” he snorted, “The 
Mels aren’t any threat at all after 
this morning. But just on general 
principals, when you set up in a 
war zone — any war zone — you set 
up as if you were going to be hit. 
Via, you may as well park your 
cars on Frieland for all the good 
they’d do if it dropped in the pot.” 

“The good colonel has been 
away from soldiers too long,” 
whipped Raeder savagely. “Major 
Mestern, would you care to en- 
lighten him as to how operations 
can be conducted by a real 
regiment — even though a gutter 
militia would be incapable of doing 
so?” 

“1 don’t . think. ,” Mest- 
ern stuttered in embarrassment. His 
fingers twiddled an empty stim 
cone. 

“Very well, then I will,” the 
blond XO snapped. Hammer was 
facing him again. This time the two 
men were within arm’s length. 
“The Regiment of Guards is using 
satellite reconnaisance. Colonel,” 
Raeder announced sneeringly. “The 



47 




same system in operation when you 
were in charge here, but we are us- 
ing it, you see.” 

“We used it. We—” 

‘‘Pardon, Colonel, permit me to 
explain and there will be fewer 
needless questions.” 

Hammer relaxed with a smile. 
There was a tiger’s certainty behind 
its humor. ‘‘No, your pardon. Con- 
tinue.” 

Hammer had killed two men in 
semi-legal duels fought on Frie- 
land’s moon. Raeder chuckled, un- 
concerned with his rival’s sudden 
mildness. “So,” he continued, ‘‘no 
Mel force could approach without 
being instantly sighted.” 

He stared at Hammer, who said 
nothing. If the Guardsman wanted 
to believe no produce truck could 
drop a Mel platoon into bunkers 
dug by a harvesting crew — spotting 
the activity was no problem, inter- 
preting it though — well, it didn’t 
matter now. But it proved again 
what Hammer had known since be- 
fore he was landed, that a lack of 
common sense was what had so 
hamstrung the regular army that his 
Slammers had to be formed. 

Of course, ‘‘common sense” 
meant to Hammer doing what was 
necessary to complete a task. And 
that sometimes created problems of 
its own. 

‘‘Our howitzers can shatter them 
ninety kilometers distant,” Raeder 
lectured on, ‘‘and our tanks can 
pierce all but the heaviest armor at 
line of sight. Colonel.” He gestured 

48 



arrogantly toward the skyline behind 
Hammer. ‘‘Anything that can be 
seen can be destroyed.” 

‘‘Yeah, it’s always a mistake to 
underrate technology,” agreed the 
man in khaki. 

“So,” Raeder said with a crisp 
nod. ‘‘It is possible to be quite effi- 
cient without being — ” his eyes 
raked Hammer’s stained, worn 
coveralls — ‘‘shoddy. When we hold 
the review tomorrow, it will be in- 
teresting to consider your . 
force . beside the Guard.” 

‘‘Via, only two of my boys are 
in,” Hammer said, ‘‘though for 
slickness I’d bet Joachim against 
anybody you’ve got.” He looked 
disinterestedly at the drink dis- 
penser. ‘‘We’ll all be back in the 
field, as soon as I see what'Tromp 
wants. We’ve got a clean-up opera- 
tion mounted in the Crescent.” 
‘‘There is a platoon present 
now,” the Guardsman snapped. ‘‘It 
will remain, as you will remain, un- 
til you receive other orders.” 

Hammer walked away without 
answering. ■ Bigger men silently 
moved aside, clearing a path to the 
dispenser. Raeder locked his lips, 
murder-tense; but a bustle at the 
central dropshaft caused him to spin 
around. His own aide, a 15-year old 
scion of his wife’s house, had 
emerged when the column dilated. 
Rather than use the PA systen built 
into the lounge before it was com- 
mandeered as an officers’ club, 
messages were relayed through 
aides waiting on the floor below. 

GALAXY 




Raeder’s boy carried a small flag 
bearing the hollow rectangle of 
Raeder’s rank, his ticket to enter the 
lounge and to set him apart from 
the officers. The boy might well be 
noble, but as yet he did not have a 
commission. He was to be made to 
remember it. 

He whispered with animation into 
Raeder’s ear, his own eyes open 
and fixed on the mercenary officer. 
Hammer ignored them both, talking 
idly as he blended another stim 
cone into his blood. The blond 
man’s face slowly took on an ex- 
pression of ruddy, mottled fury. 

“Hammer!” 

“The next time you determine 
where my boys will be. Colonel 
Raeder, 1 recommend that you ask 
me about it.” 

“You traitorous scum!” Raeder 
blazed, utterly beyond curbing his 
anger. “I closed the perimeter to 
everyone, everyone'. And you bull 
your way through my guards, get 
them to pass — ” 

“Pass my men, Lieutenant- 
Colonel!” Hammer blasted as if he 
were shouting orders through the 
howling fans of a tank. All the ten- 
sion of the former confrontation 
shuddered in the air again. Hammer 
was as set and grim as one of his 
war cars. 

Raeder raised a clenched fist. 

“Touch me and I’ll shoot you 
where you stand,” the mercenary 
said, and he had no need to raise 
his voice for emphasis. As if only 
Raeder and not the roomful of of- 



ficers as well was listening, he said, 
“You give what orders you please, 
but I’ve still got an independant 
command. As of this moment. That 
platoon is blocking a pass in the 
Crescent, because that’s what / 
want it to do, not sit around trying 
to polish away bullet scars because 
some cop-head thinks that’s a better 
idea than fighting.” 

His body still as a gravestone, 
Raeder spoke; ‘Wow you’ve got a 
command,” he said thickly. 

The wing of violence lifted from 
the lounge. Given time to consider, 
every man there knew that the battle 
was in other hands than Raeder’s 
now — and that it would be fought 
very soon. 

The dropshaft hissed again. 

Joachim Steuben’s dress was iden- 
tical in design to his colonel’s, but 
was in every other particular far 
superior. The khaki was unstained, 
the waist-belt genuine leather, 
polished to a rich chestnut sheen, 
and the coveralls themselves tapered 
to follow the lines of his boyish- 
slim figure. Perhaps it was the very 
beauty of the face smoothly framing 
Joachim’s liquid eyes that made the 
aide look not foppish, but softly 
feminine. 

There was a rich urbanity as well 
in his careful elegance. Newland, 
his homeworld, was an old colony 
with an emphasis on civilized trap- 
pings worthy of Earth herself. Just 
as Joachim’s uniform was of a 
synthetic sleeker and less rugged 
than Hammer’s, his sidearm was 



BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



49 




hunched high on his right hip in a 
holster cut away to display the artist- 
ry of what it gripped. No weapon 
in the lounge, even that of Captain 
Ryssler — the Rysslers on whose 
land Frieland’s second starport had 
been built — matched that of the 
Newlander for gorgeous detail. The 
receiver of the standard service pis- 
tol, a 1 cm powergun whose 
magazine held ten charged-plastic 
disks, had been gilded and carven 
by someone with a penchant for 
fleshy orchids. The stems and 
leaves had been filled with niello 
while the veins remained in a gold- 
en tracery. The petals themselves 
were formed from a breath- 
takingly-purple alloy of cop- 
per and gold. It was hard for any- 
one who glanced at it to realize that 
such a work of art was still, beneath 
its chasing, a lethal weapon. 

“Colonel,” he reported, his clear 
tenor a jewel in the velvet silence, 
“Secretary Tromp will see you 
now.” Neither he nor Hammer 
showed the slightest concern as to 
whether the others in the lounge 
were listening. Hammer nodded, 
wiping his palms on his thighs. 

Behind his back, Joachim winked 
at Col Raeder before turning. The 
Guardsman’s jaw dropped and 
something mewled from deep in his 
chest. 

It may have been imagination 
that made Joachim’s hips seem to 
rotate a final purple highlight from 
his pistol as the dropshaft 
sphinctered shut. 

50 



★ * * 

When the Guards landed, all but 
the fifteenth story of the Southport 
Tower was taken over for officers’ 
billets. That central floor was empty 
save for Tromp, his staff, and the 
pair of scowling Guardsmen con- 
fronting the dropshaft as it opened. 

“I’ll stay with you, sir,” 
Joachim said. The guards were in 
dress blacks but they carried full- 
sized shoulder weapons, 2 cm pow- 
erguns inferior only in rate of fire to 
the tribarrels mounted on armored 
vehicles. 

“Go on back to our quarters,” 
Hammer replied. He stepped off the 
platform. His aide showed no signs 
of closing the shaft in obedience. 
“Martyrs’ bloodl" Hammer cursed, 
“do as I say!” He wiped his palms 
again and added, more mildly, 
“That’s where I’ll need you, I 
think.” 

“If you say so, sir.” The door 
sighed closed behind Hammer, leav- 
ing him with the guards. 

“Follow the left corridor to the 
end — sir,” one of the big men di- 
rected grudgingly. The colonel nod- 
ded and walked off without com- 
ment. The two men were convinced 
their greatest worth lay in the fact 
that they were Guardsmen. To them 
it was an insult that another man 
would deliberately leave the Regi- 
ment, especially to take service with 
a band of foreign scum. Hammer 
could have used his glass-edged 
tongue on the pair as he had at the 

GAIAXY 




perimeter when he sent his platoon 
through, but there was no need. He 
was not the man to use any weapon 
for entertainment’s sake. 

The unmarked wood-veneer door 
opened before he could knock. 
“Why, good afternoon. Captain,’’ 
the mercenary said, smiling into 
Stilchey’s haggardness. “Recover- 
ing all right from this morning?’’ 
“Go on through,’’ the captain 
said. “He’s expecting you.” 

Hammer closed the inner door 
behind him, making a soft echo to 
the thump of the hall panel. Tromp 
rose from behind his desk, a great 
gray bear confronting a panther. 

“Colonel, be seated,” he rum- 
bled. Hammer nodded cautiously 
and obeyed. 

“We have a few problems which 
must be cleared up soon,” the big 
man said. He looked the soldier full 
in the face. “I’ll be frank. You al- 
ready know why I’m here.” 

“Our job’s done,” Hammer said 
without inflexion. “It costs money 
to keep the SI — the auxilliary regi- 
ment mobilized when it isn’t 
needed, so it’s time to bring my 
boys home according to contract, 
hey?” 

The sky behind Tromp was a tur- 
gid mass, gray with harbingers of 
the first storm of autumn. It pro- 
vided the only light in the room, 
but neither man moved to turn on 
the wall illuminators. “You were 
going to say ‘Slammers’, weren’t 
you?” Tromp mused. “Interesting. 
I had wondered if the newscasters

coined the nickname themselves or 
if they really picked up a usage 
here. ...” 

“The boys started it. .It 
seemed to catch on.” 

“But I’m less interested in that 
than another word,” Tromp con- 
tinued with the sudden weight of an 
anvil falling. “ ‘Home.’ And that’s 
the problem. Colonel. As you 
know.” 

“The only thing I could tell you 
is what 1 tell recruits when they 
sign on,” Hammer said, his voice 
quiet but his forehead sweat- 
gemmed in the cool air. “By their 
contract, they became citizens of 
Frieland with all rights and 
privileges thereof. .Great Dying 
Lord, sir, that’s what brought most 
of my boys here! Look, I don’t

BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



have to tell you what’s been hap- 
pening everywhere the past ten 
years, twenty — there are thousands 
and thousands of soldiers, good sol- 
diers, who wound up on one losing 
side or another. If everybody that 
fought alongside them had been as 
good, and maybe if they’d had the 
equipment Frieland could buy for 
them ... I tell you, sir, there’s no 
one in the galaxy to match them. 
And what they fight for isn’t me, I 
don’t care what cop you’ve heard, 
it’s that chance at peace, at stability 
that their fathers had and their 
fathers’ fathers, but they lost some- 
where when everything started to go 
wrong. They’d die for that 
chance!” 

‘‘But instead,” Tromp stated, 
‘‘they killed for it.” 

‘‘Don’t give me any cop about 
morals!” the soldier snarled. ‘‘Whose 
idea was it that we needed con- 
trol of bluebright shipments to be 
sure of getting metals from 
Taunus?” 

‘‘Morals?” replied Tromp with a 
snort. ‘‘Morals be hanged. Colonel. 
This isn’t a galaxy for men with 
morals, you don’t have to tell me 
that. Oh, they can moan about what 
went on here and they have — but 
nobody, not even the reporters, has 
been looking very hard. And they 
wouldn’t find many to listen if they 
had been. You and I are paid to get 
things done. Hammer, and there 
won’t be any blame except for fail- 
ure.” 

The soldier hunched his shoulders 



back against the chair. ‘‘Then it’s 
all right?” he asked in wonder. 
‘‘After all I worried, all I planned, 
my boys can go back to Frieland 
with me?” 

Tromp smiled. ‘‘Over my dead 
body,” he said pleasantly. The two 
men stared at each other without 
expression on either side. 

‘‘I’m missing something,” said 
Hammer flatly. ‘‘Fill me in.” 

The civilian rotated a flat 
datavisor toward Hammer and 
touched the indexing tab with his 
thumb. A montage of horror flick- 
ered across the screen — smoke 
drifting sullenly from a dozen low- 
lying buildings; a mass grave, 
reopened and being inspected by a 
trio of Frieland generals; another 
village without evident damage but 
utterly empty of human life — 

‘‘Chakma,” Hammer said in 
sudden recognition. ‘‘Via, you 
ought to thank me for the way we 
handled that one. I’d half thought of 
using a nuke.” 

‘‘Gassing the village was bet- 
ter?” the councillor asked with mild 
amusement. 

‘‘It was quiet. No way you could 
have kept reporters from learning 
about a nuke,” Hammer explained. 

‘‘And the convoy runs you made 
with hostages on each car?” Tromp 
asked smilingly. 

‘‘The only hostages we used were 
people we knew — and they knew 
we knew — ” Hammer’s finger 
slashed emphasis — ” were related 
to Mel soldiers who hadn’t turned

themselves in. We cut ambushes by 
a factor of ten, and we even had 
some busted when a Mel saw his 
wife or a kid riding the lead car. 
Look, I won’t pretend it didn’t hap- 
pen, but I didn’t make any bones 
about what I planned when I put in 
for transfer. This is bloody late in 
the day to bring it up.” 

“Right, you did your duty,” the 
big civilian agreed. “And I’m going 
to do mine by refusing to open Frie- 
land to 5,000 men with the training 
you gave them. Lord and Martyrs, 
Colonel, you tell me we’re going 
through a period when more gov- 
enments are breaking up than 
aren’t — what would happen to our 
planet if we set your animals loose 
in the middle of it?” 

“There’s twelve regiments of 
regulars here,” Hammer argued. 

“And if they were worth the cop 
in their trousers, we wouldn’t have 
needed your auxilliaries,” retorted 
Tromp inflexibly. “Face facts.” 

The colonel sagged. “OK,” he 
muttered, turning his face toward 
the sidewall, “I won’t pretend I 
didn’t expect it, what you just said. 
I owed it to the boys, they . they 
believe when they ought to have 
better sense, and I owed them to 
try. .’’ The soldier’s fingers 
beat a silent tattoo on the yielding 
material of his chair. He stood be- 
fore speaking further. “There’s a 
way out of it. Secretary,” he said. 
“I know there is.” 

“No!” Hammer shouted, his 
voice denying the flat finality of

Tromp’s as he spun to face the big- 
ger man again. “No, there’s a bet- 
ter way, a way that’ll work. You 
didn’t want to hire one of the free- 
lance regiments you could have had 
because they didn’t have the equip- 
ment to do the job fast. But it takes 
a government and a curst solvent 
one to equip an armored 
regiment — none of the privateers 
had that sort of capital.” 

He paused for breath. “Partly 
true,” Tromp agreed. “Of course, 
we preferred to have a commander — ’ ’ 
he smiled — “whose first loyalty 
was to Frieland.” 

Hammer spoke on, choking with 
his effort to convince the patient, 
gray iceberg of a man across from 
him, “Frieland’s always made her

money by trade. Let’s go into 
another business — let’s hire out the 
best equipped, best trained — by the 
Lord, best — regiment in the gal- 
axy!” 

‘‘And the reason that won’t 
work, Colonel,” Tromp rumbled 
coolly, ‘‘is not that it would fail, 
but that it would succeed. It takes a 
very solvent government, as you 
noted, to afford the capital expense 
of maintaining a first-rate armored 
regiment. The Melpomonese, for 
instance, could never have fielded a 
regiment of their own. But 
if . the sort of unit you suggest 
was available, they could have hired 
it for a time, could they not?” 

‘‘A few months, sure,” Hammer 
admitted with an angry flick of his 
hands, ‘‘But — ” 

‘‘Nine months, perhaps a year. 
Colonel,” the civilian went on in- 
exorably. ‘‘It would have bank- 
rupted them, but I think they 
would have paid for the same 
reason they resisted what was 
clearly overwhelming force. And 
not even Frieland could have 
economically taken Melpomone if 
the locals were stiffened by — by 
your Slammers, let us say.” 

“Lord!” Hammer shouted snap- 
ping erect, “of course we wouldn’t 
take contracts against Frieland.” 

“Men change. Colonel,” Tromp 
replied, rising to his own feet. 
“Men die. And even if they don’t, 
the very existance of a successful 
enterprise will free the capital for 
others to duplicate it. It won’t be a 



wild gamble any more. And Frie- 
land will not be the cause of that 
state of affairs while I am at her 
helm. If you’re the patriot we as- 
sumed you were when we gave you 
this command, you will order your 
men to come in by platoons and be 
disarmed.” 

The smaller man’s face was sal- 
low and his hands shook until he 
hooked them in his pistol belt. “But 
you can’t even let them go then, 
can you?” he whispered. “It might 
be all right on Frieland where there 
wouldn’t be any recruiting by out- 
siders. But if you just turn my boys 
loose, somebody else will snap 
them up, somebody else who reads 
balance sheets. Maybe trained per- 
sonnel would be enough of an edge 
to pry loose equipment on the cuff. 
Life’s rough, sure, and there are 
plenty of people willing to gamble a 
lot to make a lot more. Then we’re 
where you didn’t want us, aren’t 
we? Except that the boys are going 
to have some notions of their own 
about Frieland. .What do you 
plan. Secretary? Blowing up the 
freighter with everybody aboard? Or 
will you just have the Guards shoot 
them down when they’ve been dis- 
armed?” 

Tromp turned away for the first 
time. Lightning was flashing from 
cloud peak to cloud peak, and the 
mass that lowered over the Crescent 
was already linked to the ground by 
a haze of rain. “They put us in 
charge of things because we see 
them as they are. Colonel,” Tromp 



54 



GALAXY 




said. The vitril sheet in front of him 
trembled to the distant thunder. 
“Frieland got very good value from 
you, because you didn’t avoid un- 
pleasant decisions; you saw the best 
way and took it — be damned to ap- 
pearances. 

“I would not be where I am to- 
day if I were not the same sort of 
man. I don’t ask you to like this 
course of action — I don’t like it 
myself — but you’re a pragmatist 
too, Hammer, you see that it’s the 
only way clear for our own 
people.” 

“Secretary, anything short of 
having my boys killed, but — ” 
“Curse it, man!’’ Tromp 
shouted, “haven’t you taken a look 
around you recently? Lives are 
cheap. Colonel, lives are very 
cheap! You’ve got to have loyalty 
to something more than just men.” 
“No,” said the man in khaki 
with quiet certainty. Then, “May I 
be excused, sir?” 

“Get out of here.” 

Tromp was seated again, his own 
face a mirror of the storm, when 
Capt Stilchey slipped in the door 
through which Hammer had just 
exited. “Your lapel mike picked it 
all up.” 

The young officer gloated conspir- 
atorially. “The traitor.” 

Tromp’ s expression forced itself 
into normal lines. “You did as I 
explained might be necessary?” 
“Right. As soon as I heard the 
word ‘disarmed’ I ordered men to 
wait for Hammer in his quarters.” 

BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



Stilchey’s gleeful expression ex- 
panded to a smile of real delight. “I 
added a . refinement, sir. There 
was the possibility that Hammer 
would — you know how he is, hard 
not to obey — tell the guards be 
cursed and leave them standing. So 
I took the liberty of suggesting to 
Colonel Raeder that he lead four 
men himself for the duty. I used 
your name, sir, but I rather think 
the colonel would have gone along 
with the idea anyway.” 

The captain’s laughter hacked 
loudly through the suite before he 
realized that Tromp still sat in iron 
gloom, cradling his chin in his 
hands. 

* * ★ 

The room was a shifting bowl of 
reds and hot orange in which the 
khaki uniforms of Worzer and 
Steuben seemed misplaced. The 
only sound was a faint buzzing, the 
leakage of the bone-conduction 
speakers implanted in either man’s 
right mastoid. Hammer, like 
Tromp, had left his lapel mike 
keyed to his aides. 

“You’d best take your pistol off, 
you know. They’ll be jumpy.” 

“You’re the boss,” Worzer 
grunts. Alone, now, in the room he 
unlatches his bolstered weapon and 
tosses the rig to the floor in front of 
him. It is a fixed blackness against 
the grays that shift beneath it. Glass 
tinkles in the kitchen. Men on every 
world have set up stills, generally 
as their first constructions. Even in 



55 




a luxury hotel, Worzer’s habits are 
those of a lifetime. Hammer’s mi- 
crophone no longer broadcasts 
voices. 

The door valves open. 

“Freeze!” orders the first man 
through. He is small and blond, his 
eyes as cold as the silver frosting 
his uniform. The glowing tab of a 
master door key is in his left hand, 
a pistol in his right. The Guardsmen 
fanning to each side of him swing 
heavy powerguns at waist level, the 
muzzle’s black screams in a glitter 
of iridium. Two more men stand 
beyond the door, facing either end 
of the hallway with their weapons 
ready. 

“Move and you’re dead,” the of- 
ficer hisses to Worzer. Then, to his 
tight-lipped subordinates, “Watch 
for the other one — the deviate.” 

The kitchen door rotates to pass 
Joachim. His left hand holds a 
silver tray with a fruit-garnished 
drink on it. Reflections shimmer 
from the metal and the condensate 
on the glass. He smiles. 

“You foul beast says the of- 
ficer and his pistol turns toward the 
aide of its own seeming will. The 
enlisted men wait, uncertain. 

‘ ‘Me, Colonel Raeder?” Joachim’s 
voice lilts. He is raising the 
tray and it arcs away from his 
body in a gentle movement that 
6atches Raeder’s eyes for the instant 
that the Newlander’s right hand dips 
and — a cyan flash from Joachim’s 
pistol links the two men. Raeder’s 
mouth is open but silent. His 

56 



eyeballs are bulging outward against 
the pressure of exploding nerve tis- 
sue. There is a hole between them 
and it winks twice more in the flash 
of Joachim’s shots. Two spent cases 
hang in the air to the Newlander’s 
right; a third is jammed, smeared 
across his pistol’s ejection port. 
None of the Guardsmen have begun 
to fall, though a gout of blood 
pours from the neck of the right- 
hand man. 

It is two-fifths of a second from 
the moment when Joachim reached 
for his pistol. 

Worzer had been ready. He 
leaped as Steuben’s shots flickered 
across the room, twisting the shoul- 
der weapon from a Guardsman who 
did not realize he was already dead. 
The stocky Curwinite hit the floor 
on his right side, searching the 
doorway with the powergun. In the 
hall, a guard shouted as he spun 
himself to face the shooting. 
Joachim’s jammed pistol had thud- 
ded on the floor but Worzer wasted 
no interest on what the aide might 
do — you did not worry about 
Joachim in a firefight, he took care 
of himself. The non-com had been 
squeezing even as he fell, and only 
a feather of trigger pressure was left 
to take up when the Guardsman’s 
glittering uniform sprouted above 
the sights. 

Heated air thumped the walls of 
the room. The body ballooned un- 
der the cyan impact. The big-bore 
packed enough joules to vaporize 
much of a man’s abdomen at that 



GALAXY 




range, and the Frielander hurtled 
back against the far wall. His tunic 
was afire and spilling coils of intes- 
tine. 

The boots of the remaining 
Guardsman clattered on the tile as 
he bolted for the dropshaft. Joachim 
snaked his head and the pistol he 
had snatched from Raeder through 
the doorway. Worzer and the big 
gun plunged into the corridor low to 
cover the other end. The shaft en- 
trance opened even before the Fri- 
sian’s outflung arm touched the 
summoning plate. Hammer, stand- 
ing on the platform, shot him twice 
in the chest. The Guardsman 
pitched into the wall. As he did so, 
Joachim shot him again at the base 
of the skull. Joachim generally 
doubted other men’s kills, a practice 
that had saved his life in the past. 

Hammer glanced down at the jel- 
lied skull of the last Guardsman and 
grimaced. “Didn’t anybody tell you 
about aiming at the body instead of 
getting fancy?’’ he asked Joachim. 
Neither man commented that the fi- 
nal shot had been aimed within a 
meter of Hammer. 

The Newlander shrugged. “They 
should’ve been wearing body ar- 
mor,’’ he said offhandedly. “Coppy 
fools.’’ 

The colonel scooped up both the 
powerguns from the corridor and 
gestured his men back into the 
room. The air within stank of blood 
and hot plastic. Death had been too 
sudden to be prefaced with pain, 
but the faces of the Guardsmen all 



held slack amazement. Hammer 
shook his head. “With five 
thousand of you to choose from,” 
he said to Joachim, “didn’t they 
think I could find a decent body- 
guard?” 

The Newlander smiled. After his 
third quick shot, the expended disk 
had been too hot to spin out whole 
and had instead flowed across the 
mechanism when struck by the jet 
of ejection gas. Joachim was care- 
fully chipping away at the cooled 
plastic with a stylus while the pistol 
he had taken from his first victim 
lay on the table beside him. Its 
muzzle had charred the veneer sur- 
face. “There isn’t enough gas in a 
handgun ejector to cool the chamber 
properly,” he said, pretending to 
ignore his colonel’s indirect praise. 

“Via, you hurried cause you 
wanted all of them,” Worzer 
laughed. He thumbed a loaded 
round into the magazine of the 
shoulder gun he had appropriated. 
“What’s the matter — don’t you 
want the Colonel to bother bringing 
me along the next time ’cause I 
scare away all your pretty friends?” 

Hammer forced a smile at the in- 
terchange, but it was only a shim- 
mer across lines of fear and anger. 
On one wall was a communicator, a 
flat, meter-broad screen whose sur- 
face was an optical pickup as well 
as a display. Hammer stepped in 
front of it and drew the curtain to 
blank the remainder of the room. 
His fingers flicked the controls, 
bringing Capt Stilchey into startled 



BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



57 




focus. Tromp’s aide blinked, but 
before he could speak the colonel 
said, “We’ve got three minutes, 
Stilchey, and there’s no time to cop 
around. Put me through.” 

Stilchey’s mouth closed. Without 
comment he reached out and 
pressed his own control panel. With 
liquid abruptness his figure was re- 
placed by the hulking power of Se- 
cretary Tromp, seated against the 
closing sky. 

“Tell the Guard to ground arms. 
Secretary,” Hammer ordered in a 
voice trembling with adrenalin. 
“Tell them now and I’ll get on the 
horn to my boys — it’ll be close.” 

“I’m sorry for the necessity of 
your arrest. Colonel,” the big man 
began, “but — ” 

“Idiot!” Hammer shouted at the 
pickup, and his arm slashed aside 
the drapes to bare the room. “I 
heard your terms — now listen to 
mine. I’ve arranged for a freighter 
to land tomorrow at 0700 and the 
whole regiment’s leaving on it. I’ll 
leave you an indenture for the fair 
value of the gear, and it’ll be paid 
off as soon as contracts start coming 
in. But the Lord help you, Tromp, 
if anybody tries to stop my boys.” 

“Capt Stilchey,” Tromp ordered 
coolly, “sound general quarters. As 
for you. Colonel,” he continued 
without taking verbal notice of the 
carnage behind the small officer, “I 
assure you that the possibility you 
planned something like this was in 
my mind when I ordered the Guards 
landed with me.” 



“Secretary, we planned what 
we’d do if we had to a month and a 
half ago. Don’t be so curst a fool to 
doubt my boys can execute orders 
without me to hold their hands. If I 
don’t radio in the next few seconds, 
you won’t have the Guards to send 
back. Lord and Martyrs, man, don’t 
you understand what you see back 
of me? This isn’t some coppy 
parade!” 

“Sir,” came Stilchey’s thin voice 
from off-screen, “Fire Central re- 
ports all satellite signals are being 
jammed. The armored units in the 
Crescent began assembling 
thirty — Lord! Lord! Sir\” 

A huge scarlet dome swelled up- 
ward across the vitril behind 
Tromp. The window powdered 
harmlessly an instant later as the 
shock wave threw man and desk 
toward Hammer’s image. The entire 
hotel shuddered to the blast. 

“They’re blowing up the artil- 
lery,” the captain bleated. “The 
ammunition — ” His words were 
drowned in the twin detonations of 
the remaining batteries. 

Hammer switched the com- 
municator off. “Early,” he mut- 
tered. “Not that it mattered.” His 
face was set like that of a man who 
had told his disbelieving mechanic 
that something was wrong with the 
brakes, and who now feels the 
pedal sink to the firewall to prove 
him fatally correct. “Don’t go to 
sleep,” he grunted to his compan- 
ions. “Tromp knows he’s lost, and 
I’m not sure how he’ll react.”

But only Worzer was in the room 
with him. 

* ♦ ♦ 

Though Tromp was uninjured, he 
rose only to his knees. He had seen 
Capt Stilchey when the jagged sheet 
of iridium buzz-sawed into the suite 
and through him. Scuttling like a 
stiff-legged bear, the civilian made 
his way to the private dropshaft 
built into the room. He pretended to 
ignore the warm greasiness of the 
floor, but by the time the platform 
began to sink his whole body was 
trembling. 

Ground floor was a chaos of 
half-dressed officers who had been 
on the way to their units when fire 
raked the encampment. Tromp 
pushed through a trio of chattering 
captains in the branch corridor; the 
main lobby of bronze and off-planet 
stonework was packed and static, 
filled with men afraid to go out and 
uncertain where to hide. The coun- 
cillor cursed. The door nearest him 
was ajar and he kicked it fully 
open. The furniture within was in 
sleep-mode, the self-cleaning sheets 
rumpled on the bed, but there was 
no one present. The vitril outer wall 
had pulverized; gouges in the in- 
terior suggested more than a shock 
wave had been responsible for the 
damage. 

Seen through it, the starport had 
become a raving hell. 

Four hundred meters from the 
hotel, one of the anti-artillery 
weapons was rippling sequential 

BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



flame skyward from its eight bar- 
rels. High in a boiling thunderhead 
at its radar-chosen point of aim, 
man-made lightning flared magenta; 
high explosive caught in flight. Al- 
most simultaneously a dart of cyan 
more intense than the sun lanced 
into the Guard vehicle. Metal 
heated too swiftly to melt and sub- 
limed in a glowing ball that 
silhouetted the gun crew as it de- 
voured them. Hammer’s tanks, 
bunkered in the Crescent, were us- 
ing satellite-computed deflections to 
rake the open Guard positions. 
Twenty kilometers and the thin ar- 
mor of the lighter vehicles were no 
defense against the 200 mm power- 
guns. 

Tromp stepped over the low sill 
and began to run. The field was wet 
and a new slash of rain pocked its 
gleam. Three shells popped high in 
the air. He ignored them, pounding 
across the field in a half-crouch. 
For a moment the whistling begin- 
ning to fill the sky as if from a 
thousand tiny mouths meant nothing 
to him either — then realization 
rammed a scream from his throat 
and he threw himself prone. The 
bomblets showering down from the 
shells went off on impact all across 
the field, orange flashes that each 
clipped the air with scores of frag- 
ments. Panic and Hammer’s tanks 
had silenced the Guard’s defensive 
weaponry. Now the rocket howit- 
zers were free to rain in wilful 
death. 

But the tanks, Tromp thought as 

59 




he stumbled to his feet, they can’t 
knock out the tanks from twenty 
kilometers and they can’t capture 
the port while the Guard still has 
that punch. The surprise was over 
now. Left fans keened from the 
perimeter as the great silvery forms 
of armored vehicles shifted from 
their targeted positions. The com- 
batants were equal, and a stand-off 
meant disaster for the mercenaries. 

Much of the blood staining 
Tromp’s clothing was his own, 
licked from his veins by shrapnel. 
Incoming shells were bursting at 
ten-second intervals. Munitions 
shortages would force a slowdown 
soon, but for the moment anyone 
who stood to run would be scythed 
down before his third step. Even 
flat on his belly Tromp was being 
stung by hot metal. His goal, the 
ten-place courier vessel that had 
brought him to Melpomone, was 
still hopelessly far off. The remains, 
however, of one of the Guard’s 
self-propelled howitzers lay like a 
cleat-kicked drink-can thirty meters 
distant. Painfully the councillor 
crawled into its shelter. Hammer’s 
punishing fire had not been directed 
at the guns themselves but at the 
hauler in the midst of each battery. 
After three shots the secondary ex- 
plosions had stripped the Guard of all 
its ill-sited artillery. 

A line of rain rippled across the 
field, streaking dried blood from 
Tromp’s face and whipping the 
pooled water. He was not running 
away. There was one service yet 

60 



that he could perform for Frieland, 
and he had to be home to ac- 
complish it. After that — and he 
thought of it not as revenge but as a 
final duty — he would not care that 
reaction would assuredly make him 
the scapegoat for the catastrophe 
now exploding all around him. It 
was obvious that Hammer had or- 
dered his men to disturb the 
spaceport as little as possible so that 
the mercenaries would not hinder 
their own embarkation. The lightly- 
rattling shrapnel crumpled gun 
crews and the bewildered Guard in- 
fantry, but it would not harm the 
port facilities themselves nor the 
ships docked there. 

For the past several minutes no 
powerguns had lighted the field. 
The bunkered mercenaries had 
either completed their programs or 
ceased fire when a lack of second- 
ary explosions informed them that 
the remaining Guard vehicles had 
left their targeted positions. The de- 
fenders had at first fired wild vol- 
leys at no better target than the 
mountain range itself, but a few 
minutes’ experience had taught 
them that the return blasts aimed at 
their muzzles were far more effec- 
tive then their own could possibly 
be. Now there was a lull in the 
shelling as well. 

Tromp eased a careful glance 
beyond the rim of his shelter, the 
buckled plenum chamber of the gun 
carriage. His ship was a horizontal 
needle three hundred meters distant. 
The vessel was unlighted, limned as 



GALAXY 




a gray shadow by cloud-hopping 
lighting. The same flashes gleamed 
momentarily on the wet turtle-backs 
of a dozen tanks and combat cars in 
a nearby cluster, their fans idling. 
All the surviving Guard units must 
be clumped in similar hedgehogs 
across the port. 

The big man tensed himself to 
run; then the night popped and 
crackled as a Guard tank began fir- 
ing out into the storm. Tromp 
counted three shots before a cyan 
dazzle struck the engaged vehicle 
amidships and its own ammunition 
went off with an electric crash. The 
clustered vehicles were lit by a 
blue-green fire that expanded for 
three seconds, dissolving everything 
within twenty meters of its center. 
One of the remaining combat cars 
spun on howling fans, but it col- 
lapsed around another bolt before it 
could pull clear. There were 
Guardsmen on the ground now, 
running from their vehicles. 
Tromp’s eyes danced with afterim- 
ages of the exploding tank, and for 
the first time he understood why 
Stilchey had been so terrified by the 
destruction of the car he might have 
ridden in. 

Half a dozen shots ripped from 
beyond the perimeter and several 
struck home together. All the Guard 
blowers were burning now, throw- 
ing capering shadows beyond the 
councillor’s shelter. Then, threading 
their way around the pools of slag, 
the steam and the dying fires, came 
a trio of tanks. Even without the 

BUT LOYAL TO HIS OWN 



scarlet wand wavering from each 
turret for identification, Tromp 
would have realized these were not 
the polished beauties of the Guard. 
The steel skirts of their plenum 
chambers were rusty and brush- 
worn. One’s gouged turret still 
glowed where a heavy powergun 
had hit it glancingly; the muzzle of 
its own weapon glowed too, and the 
bubbling remains of the perimeter 
defense left no doubt whose bolts 
had been more accurately directed. 
The fighting had been brief. Ham- 
mer’s platoons meeting the disor- 
ganized Guardsmen with point- 
blank volleys. The victors’ hatches 
were open and as they swept in to- 
ward the central tower, Tromp 
could hear their radios crackling 
triumphant instructions. Other 
wands floated across the immense 
field, red foxfire in the rain. 

The shooting had stopped. Now, 
before the combat cars and infantry 
followed up the penetrations their 
tanks had made, Tromp stood and 
ran to his ship. His career was 
ruined, of that he had no doubt. No 
amount of deceit would cover his 
role in the creation of the Slammers 
or his leadership in the attempted 
suppression. All that was left to 
Nicholas Tromp was the sapphire 
determination that the national 
power which he had worked four 
decades to build should not fall with 
him. They could still smash Ham- 
mer before he got started, using 
Frieland’s own fleet and the fleets 
of a dozen other worlds. The cost 

61 





would leave even Frieland groaning, 
but they could blast the Slanmiers 
inexorably from space wherever 
they were landed. For the sake of 
his planet’s future, the excision had 
to be made, damn the cost. 

And after Tromp fell in disgrace 
in the next week or two weeks at 
most, there would be no man left 
with the power to force the action 
or the foresight to see its necessity. 
Panting, he staggered through his 
vessel’s open lock. The interior, 
too, was unlighted. That was not 
surprising in view of the combat 
outside, but one of the three crew- 
men should have been waiting at 
the lock. “Where are you?’’ Tromp 
called angrily. 

The lights went on. There was a 
body at the big Frisian’s feet. From 
the cockpit forward stretched 
another hairline of blood still fresh 
enough to ooze. “I’m here,’’ said a 
cultured voice from behind. 

Tromp froze. Very slowly, he 
began to turn his head. 

“People like you,’’ the voice 
continued, “with dreams too big for 
men to fit into, don’t see the same 
sort of world that the rest of us do. 
And sometimes a fellow who does 
one job well can see where his job 
has to be done, even though a better 
man has overlooked it. Anyhow, 
Secretary, there always was one 
thing you and I could agree on — 
lives cheap.’’ 

Surely Joachim’s wrists were too 
slim, Tromp thought, to raise his 
heavy pistol so swiftly. ★

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

We’ve lost Corbett. 

Four of us managed to get this far; 
deep into this funnel-shaped pit that 
seems to be a full-scale mockup of 
Dante’s Inferno. It’s been a hairy, 
scary trip. We’ve waded through boil- 
ing blood, we’ve been stranded in a 
desert under flakes of fire. A devil-car 
smashed Billy to jelly, but he healed. 
We always heal; we can’t die. The 
Builders have done something to our 
bodies. 

The lower we get, the worse it gets. 

It seems to be an entertainment play- 
ground for sadomasochists, some of 
whom might not be human . or else 
we’ve actually died and gone to Dante 
Alighieri’s strange Hell. I’ve seen so 
many miracles that I’m not sure any 
more. The place does have a kind of 
internal logic. 

It was the second pit of the Eighth 
Circle that lost us Corbett. He couldn’t 
take what they were doing to the adver- 
tising men. He ran back toward the 
cliff, screaming that he was going back 
to the place of the winds, where he be- 
longs. It’s way upslope. I don’t know 
how he’ll get up the cliff. 

Billy’s still with us. Maybe he really 
is Billy the Kid; we’ve seen enough re- 
vived dead men. He’s not too bright, 
and the torture chamber around us 
doesn’t bother him much. I'm glad 
he’s here. He can fight. 

The tortures bother Benito even less. 
He keeps calling them “Justice”. It 
gives me the chills. He could be a devil 
himself ... or one of the Inferno- 
land’s paying customers. Geryon is a 
devil, and Geryon knew him. 

On the face of it he’s a stolid fat 
man with a strong faith in Catholicism 
and Dante Alighieri’s map. We’ve 
found mistakes in Dante’s descriptions, 

64 



and places that Dante never saw. Still 
we follow Benito along Dante’s route, 
down to the bottom of everything, 
where Dante described a way out of 
Hell . for a living man whose guide 
can call on angels. 

We can’t go back; the cliff would 
stop us. There are devils around us: 
big half-humanoids, and Geryon, an 
aquatic life-form wearing what might 
be an antigravity belt. So we can’t stay 
here. We have to keep going down. 

Part III

The third gully was narrower, 
and cleaner. From the edge it 
looked eiflpty, so that I wondered if 
there were a sin nobody would 
commit, or one nobody thought of. 
But lights danced dimly down 
there . 

From the arch it was clearer. I 
made out long rows of holes cut 
into the stone. The holes had raised 
stone rims. Most of them were oc- 
cupied, each by a pair of human 
feet sticking straight up into the air. 
The feet danced. Flames burned on 
their soles. 

“Another obsolete sin,” said Be- 
nito. “Selling holy offices. 
Simony.” 

Billy said, “Huh?” 

I translated. “Those guys would 
take money to make a priest.” 

There were signs by some of the 
holes. “Wharton School of Theolo- 
gy. Earn your Th. D. in just ten 
weeks! Write Registrar for applica- 
tion.” 

And another: “Meditation. The 
new way to inner peace and sereni- 
ty. Meet the greatest guru of all 
time. Registration fee, $350.00.” 




Billy was aghast. “God does that 
to them? Just for that!” 

“They stole what belongs to 
God,’’ Benito said. “There are 
Popes in those baptismal fonts. And 
many others. The denomination 
does not seem important. What mat- 
ters is the sale of the gifts of God.’’ 
Why would aliens care about 
that? Well, Carpentierl 

“Benito, I don’t like it here,’’ 
Billy said. 

I patted his shoulder. “Me nei- 
ther. Let’s get out.” I felt the urge to 
run. At least I was safe from this 
pit. We all were. We’d never had 
Heavenly Gifts to sell. 

The bridge over the fourth gully 
was just ahead, and I glanced into it 
from the top, intending to run on 
past. The strange sight held me. 
The damned flowed beneath us, and 
their heads had been turned back to 
front. Most of them were women. 

“Fortune tellers,’’ Benito said 
before 1 could ask. “They tried to 
see the future by magic.” 

And now they were not even al- 
lowed to watch where they were go- 
ing. I shivered, thinking that a sci- 
ence fiction writer might welt end 
up here. But no. I’d never used 
magic. Only logic, and it hadn’t 
kept me out of Hell. “Why aren’t 
all the scientists and economic 
prognosticators here?” I asked. 
“They try to foresee the future.” 
“Most of these appealed to Satan 
for aid. He gave it to them ... or 
not. It is the appeal that weighs 
against them.” He turned to move 
on. 

Then I recognised one of the 
damned. 

A little elderly lady, very prim 
and proper. She’d been a teacher in 

INFERNO 



my nephew’s school. Now she 
walked with her head turned back- 
ward, and tears ran down her spine 
and between her buttocks. I 
screamed. The damned looked up at 
me. 

“Mrs. Herrnstein! Why?” I 
shouted. 

She looked away. Then she 
stopped and looked up. Face and 
back turned toward us. She’d always 
been thin, and I’d never thought of 
her as particularly feminine. Cer- 
tainly she wasn’t feminine now. “I 
belong here. Mister Carpentier,” 
she called. “Please leave. I don’t 
want to be watched.” 

“You belong here?” I could not 
see Mrs. Herrnstein with a crystal 
ball. 

“Yes. Whenever I had a pupil 
who had difficulty learning to read, 
I used — I was a bad teacher. Mister 
Carpentier.” 

“You were a good teacher! You 
taught Hal more in a year than he 
learned in five!” 

“I was a good teacher with good 
pupils. But I could not be bothered 
with the ones who weren’t so 
bright. If they had trouble learning 
to read, I said they had dyslexia.” 

“Are you here because of bad 
diagnoses?” This was monstrous! 

“Dyslexia is not a diagnosis. 
Mister Carpentier. It is a prediction. 
It is a prediction that says that this 
child can never learn to read. And 
with that prediction on his 
record — why, strangely enough, 
none of them ever do. Unless they 
happen on a teacher who doesn’t 
believe in educationese witchcraft.” 

“But—” 

“It was witchcraft. Mister Car- 
pentier. Please go now.” She 

65 




walked on, crying uncontrollably, 
her face toward us as she walked 
away. I watched until she was out 
of sight. 

“She does not belong here,” I 
insisted. 

“Then perhaps she will not be 
here long,” Benito answered dis- 
passionately. “Yet — you will note 
that she did not agree with your 
judgement.” 

“Then she’s wrong too!” 

“Why do you feel so competent 
to judge everyone, Allen?” 

“Get it through your thick head 
that it’s Big Juju I’m judging — ” 

“It is God you are judging,” he 
thundered. 

“All right, it’s God I’m judging. 
If He can judge me, I claim the 
right to judge Him!” 

Billy seemed horrified by what I 
was saying. I was sorry for that. 
But Benito laughed and said, “How 
will you implement your judgement 
against God Himself?” 

The only possible answer to that 
was a feeble one, maybe, but I used 
it. “By withholding my worship. 
Benito, do you realise that the God 
you worship keeps a private torture 
chamber?” 

“Hardly private.” 

“Private or public, the God Allen 
Carpentier worships will have to 
meet higher standards than thatV’ 
Benito didn’t speak for a mo- 
ment. Then he said, “We must 
hope our shouting was not heard. 
Look ahead.” 

* * ★ 

From our position at the top of 
the arch we had a good view of the 
rims of the next gully. On both 
sides of the gap, horned black de- 

66 



mons moved. They were larger than 
men, a little smaller than the de- 
mons in the first ditch, but like 
them they had horns and tail, and 
their skin was black ebony, very 
different from a black man’s skin. 
They carried — 

“Pitchforks?” 

“Certainly,” said Benito. 

I couldn’t help grinning a little. 
Pitchforks! I’d forgotten that detail. 
Had Walt Disney’s cartoonists ever 
realised why their devils carried 
pitchforks? 

“They must not see us,” Benito 
said. “None of us are safe from 
them. They guard the pit of the 
grafters, of those who stole from 
positions of trust.” 

Billy shuddered. “Reckon they’d 
like me,” he said. “Guess I took a 
few things from my bosses in my 
day. Not much, buf some.” 

“Not me. Freelance writers don’t 
have bosses,” I said. Then I re- 
membered the advance from Om- 
niverse Publishing, nine years be- 
fore I died. Somehow the novel had 
never jelled, and let’s play it safe 
here, Carpentier. Demons wouldn’t 
understand the publishing business. 

There was cover at the bottom of 
the bridge. It was all a jumble of 
boulders. We waited our chance, 
then sprinted down the bridge while 
none of the demons were nearby. 
We were hidden before another 
group came past. We huddled to- 
gether between the rocks. 

“Too bad the bridges are 
staggered,” I whispered. “We 
could have gone right across.” The 
next bridge was thirty or forty yards 
to the left, with a troop of twenty- 
odd demons between. 

“For us this is the second most 

GALAXY 




dangerous place in Hell,” whis- 
pered Benito. ‘‘We must, reach the 
next bridge without being seen. 
Cross at a dead run, and do not stop 
at the next pit. Run straight into it. 
There are no bridges in any case, 
and^we could not reach one if any 
existed. The demons are on both 
sides of the pit. 

Billy shifted restlessly. ‘‘Don’t 
like running from nothing.” 

We must,” Benito said simply. 
He pointed. A demon strode past. 

A roughly human form nine feet 
tall, equipped with horns and 
hooves and a twitching tail. A cap- 
riform humanoid. 

How glib, Carpentier. Capriform 
humanoid? Demon! Why play 
games with yourself? 

The demon was carrying a human 
being, carrying him like a bowling 
ball, his claws inserted deep into 
the man’s back. The man writhed 
and struggled. The demon didn’t 
seem to notice. He called to three 
of the others. ‘‘How many New 
Yorkers this week?” 

They joined him in front of our 
rock. One twitched his tail up to his 
mouth. Teeth like butcher knives 
gnawed at the end. “Twelve.” 
“Make it thirteen. And it’s still 
Thursday on Earth. If Hideous wins 
the pool again I’ll rip his face off.” 
“You could forget to report this 
one.” 

“Why not?” The first demon 
lifted his human burden to study it. 
“He hardly counts anyway. He 
stole a few hundred bucks from a 
friend who needed an eye opera- 
tion.” He addressed the man: “You 
won’t tell on us, will you?” 

“No. I swear,” said the man. 
His voice was choked with agony. 

INFERNO 



“And you won’t show your head 
above the pitch? Because if we see 
any sign of you—” The demon 
hefted his pitchfork suggestively. 
“We’ll pull you out and tear you in 
little pieces and scatter you widely. 
It hurts a lot.” 

“I won’t tell,” said the man. 
“Good,” said the demon holding 
him; and he flung him. The man 
dropped below the rim with a 
mournful howl that ended in a 
sound half splash, half thud. 

“What’s down there?” Billy 
whispered. 

I answered, “Boiling pitch.” 
“What’d he do?” 

“Graft.” 

“I wanted to try to save him.” 
Benito said, “I would not save 
him if I could.” 

The demons passed on. Like the 
warriors around the lake of blood, 
they looked always into the pit, al- 
ways away from us. If we were 
careful we could move, one at a 
time, flitting from rock to rock to — 
“Gotcha!” a demon shouted, and 
I had a heart attack, right out there 
between two inadequate boulders. 
All they had to do was come and 
collect me; but they weren’t look- 
ing. They were clumped at the rim. 
Jabbing down. 

A human form came up dripping 
gobbets of black pitch and trying to 
wriggle free of the tines of two 
pitchforks. I heard, “Boss Tweed, 
ain’t it? We been checking with 
some of those dead men that’re 
supposed to have voted your 
ticket — Hold him, Crazyred!” The 
man lurched free of one pitchfork, 
but the other held him fast. They 
beached him. They began to play 
with him. 

67 




I touched Billy’s shoulder. 
“Don’t look. We can get a good 
way while they’re busy.” 

We crawled like snakes. By the 
time the shade of Tweed had 
stopped screaming, we were opposite 
the bridge. I looked back once and 
had to close my eyes. The demons 
had opened him up and spread him 
out like a frog in biology class; but 
unlike the frog, he was still trying 
to get away. 

Benito crouched like a sprinter. 
“Ready?” 

“Yeah.” 

“Right.” 

We ran. 

I heard a great roar of rage. I 
didn’t look back. But as I went over 
the arch, last in line, I saw that the 
demons on the far side of the gully 
were running to meet us. 

One was going to make it. 

I stopped. Only for an instant; 
then I plunged down the arch be- 
hind Benito. 

But Billy had doubled his speed. 

The demon reached the end of 
the bridge off balance and skidding. 
“Come to Poppa!” he roared, and 
swung his pitchfork around. 

He was a nanosecond late. Billy 
shot past the tines and ran up the 
demon and swarmed over the huge 
head. 

The demon bellowed and tried to 
reverse eighteen feet of iron pitch- 
fork. Benito slammed shoulder-first 
into his knee. The'demon half- 
turned, and I hit the other knee 
sideways. Both huge legs went out 
from under the demon, left him 
blind and falling. 

Half a ton of demon slammed into 
the rock. 

Billy rolled away. The demon 



moaned and tried to gather his 
knees to his chest. 

“Now run!” cried Benito. “Bil- 
ly!’ ’ 

A troop of demons was almost on 
us. I raced for the next pit, stopped 
at the edge. Where was Billy? 

Billy had retrieved the demon’s 
pitchfork and was raising it for the 
kill. 

I yelled, “Never mind that!” and 
then it was just too late. Billy yelled 
triumph and brought the pitch- 
fork down hard. He raised it for 
another thrust, and they had him. I 
jumped into space alongside Benito. 
Three-inch fingernails clicked shut 
behind my neck. 



XXI 

The side of the gully was rough 
rock falling almost sheer. I glimpsed 
it in free fall, and when I saw 
that there were no handholds I sim- 
ply gave up. A couple of seconds 
later I lay broken at the bottom, 
staring up at the non-sky. 

In the sea of pain I couldn’t tell 
what was broken and what was only 
bruised. But I remembered that 
you’re not supposed to move an ac- 
cident victim. I didn’t try to move. 
Rustling near me. “Benito?” 
“Over here.” 

“Are you hurt?” 

“Yes ” 

“Me too.” 

“We are out of their path, I 
think. We need only wait to heal.” 
Whose path? I was afraid to turn 
my head, but I turned my eyes. I 
found myself looking up along the 
fluted robe of a life-sized golden 
statue. No information there. 



68 



GALAXY 




I said, “What about Billy?” 

“Poor Billy. His urge to violence 
betrayed him.” 

“Don’t be so damned philosophi- 
cal. We’ve got to get him out of 
their hands!” 

“How?” 

“Well . first we wait to heal, 

1 guess. Where would they put him? 
In the pitch with the Tammany 
types?” 

“Look up along the edge of the 
gully.” 

Something like an endless length 
of rope was falling in loops across 
the sky. It dropped very slowly, as 
if almost weightless. As it came 
near I. saw that it was thicker than 
rope, and there was a tuft on the 
end . Where had I seen some- 
thing like that recently? 

Above our heads it hesitated, 
then descended like a blind worm. 
For seconds it was hidden behind 
the rock slope. Then it began to 
rise . and the end was coiled 
around something that moved. Bil- 
ly- 

“Minos,” I said. “It’s his tail.” 

“Yes.” 

Before we could move, Billy 
would be back on the island in the 
river of blood — or in the river itself; 
he’d left the island of his own free 
will. He was beyond our reach. I 
sighed and turned my eyes from the 
tiny struggling figure and the infi- 
nite sprawl of Minos’ tail. 

And the statue had moved. 

It had gone past me by about one 
yard. I turned my head, regardless 
of consequences. My neck wasn’t 
broken. And there were two bare 
human feet beneath the hem of the 
golden robe. One moved a good six 
inches as I watched. 



“Benito. There are men in those 
things.” 

“And women too,” said Benito. 
“Religious hypocrites.” 

He stood up carefully, testing to^ 
see if everything had healed. Appar- 
ently it had. He tried to help me 
up, but pain yelped in my ribs. I sat 
down against the slope to wait some 
more. 

Golden robes moved past like 
snails. There were men and women 
in those golden idols, but I saw 
only bare feet and shadowed faces 
within enormous hoods. One 
stopped, and turned with the same 
excruciating slowness that charac- 
terized his walk, and said, “Are 
you lost?” 

Benito said we weren’t. I asked, 
“Are you?” 

“Why, no. I think this is my 
proper place.” His accent was thick 
and hard to identify. “I have been 
here long enough to be convinced 
that God thinks so too.” 

“How long is that?” 

“Over a thousand years have 
passed on Earth, I’m told.” 

“That’s a little hard to swallow,” 
I said. “The English language isn’t 
that old.” 

“I know,” said the priest. “We 
teach each other. I learned this lan- 
guage from one who came here re- 
cently, an Amie Semple MacPher- 
son. There is little else to do as we 
wander this endless channel, and 
you may imagine that it is easier to 
teach each other than to search for 
some companion who speaks our 
own language.” 

“Why,” I asked, “don’t you 
stop and sit down?” 

The tired grey eyes studied me 
from within the golden cowl. “I 

69 



INFERNO 




could fall on you. But it may be 
that you do not know what you say. 
If 1 stop this robe grows hot. It is 
too hot now. It grows hot slowly 
and it grows cool slowly. Now, 
goodby.” He began to turn away. 

Benito said, “We could walk 
along with you.” 

“That would please me.’’ He 
finished his turn and took one lurch- 
ing footstep. 

1 got up. The ruined ribs only 
twinged. “How heavy is that robe?” 
I asked. 

“I never weighed it. They tell me 
it is gilded lead. Perhaps a ton?” 

“What did you do?” 

“Does it matter? I was young, I 
had not been a priest for many 
years. But the end of the thousand 
years since Christ was born were 
drawing to a close. People began to 
fear the end of the world. I urged 
them to give away their property. 
To the Church. We became very 
wealthy.” 

“You could have given it back, 
afterwards.” 

“We did not.” 

“Did all of you end up here? The 
whole Order?” 

“No. Some truly thought the 
world would end. Some believed a 
wealthy Church could serve souls 
better. But I never believed the 
Second Coming could be predicted, 
and I enjoyed the wealth. I — do you 
need to know more? It was a good 
thing to be in the Church in those 
days.” 

Benito tapped my shoulder and 
pointed. “There is our way out. 
The rubble from the bridge.” 

It had been a bridge, high and 
arching like those we’d crossed be- 
fore. Now it was a sloping pile of 

70 



shattered rock. I looked at it curi- 
ously, but it didn’t seem different 
from any other rock I’d seen, and I 
could see that normal laws of mate- 
rial strength didn’t hold down here. 
It wasn’t a surprise. 

“What happened to it?” I won- 
dered. “Earthquake?” 

“I am told that all Hell shook at 
the moment of Christ’s Death,” 
said the ex-priest. 

“So says Dante,” Benito added. 
“Afterward, He came to Hell, and 
threw down the great gate in the 
wall of Dis.” 

“He must have been mad about 
something. I suppose being 
crucified could do that to you.” 

“I would be less flippant, Allen. 
Look around you.” Before I could 
answer, Benito had started climbing 
the ruined bridge. 

It was still a ridiculous picture. 
Christ was supposed to be gentle. 
Using a whip on the temple 
money-changers was one thing; be- 
having like a comic book hero was 
something else. I tried to imagine 
the bleeding, wounded, near-naked 
Figure ripping those tremendous 
iron gates from their hinges, while 
the halo flamed angrily about His 
Head- 

Then gave it up and climbed up 
after Benito. I tested each foothold, 
but some of the slabs slid down 
anyway. 

Near the top the rockslide ended, 
and we climbed by fingerholds and 
toeholds. There it was that I had to 
repress a sudden, violent urge to 
giggle. 

Benito wouldn’t have appreciated 
it. But — no wonder Christ was so 
upset. 

Some clerk must have tried to 
GALAXY 




hand Him Form D-345t839y-4583. 

* * * 

The seventh pit was enormous. I 
stood at the end of the bridge and 
marvelled at the thin fairy-span 
arching across. Carbon steel 
wouldn’t have taken the stress; yet 
it was made of stone without mor- 
tar, like the fallen bridge behind us. 
Another miracle, and so what? 

We started across. 

It was dark down there. What I 
could see had a vaguely reptilian 
flavor to it: constant slow slither- 
ings, and sudden flurries of violent 
motion. 

Benito pulled at my arm. “Why 
do you dawdle, Allen?’’ 

“Who are they?’’ 

“Thieves. Theft is the most prof- 
itable of sins, and very popular. 
Tell me, Allen, do you expect to 
see anything down there that pleases 
you?’’ 

He had me there. I didn’t. But — 
“I’m a writer. I’ve got ten men’s 
curiosity. What’s the huny? Are we 
in danger here?” 

“I remind you that we are fugi- 
tives.” 

I stared in astonishment. “Ge- 
ryon could have stopped us. Minos 
could have stopped us. They 
didn’t.” 

“The demons behind us would 
have. Oh, very well, Allen. The 
real danger is at the next pit. We 
must cross that quickly.” 

“Okay.” And I looked down 
again. 

Reptilian, yeah. There were men 
and women down there . and 
lizards ranging in size from 
Chihuahua to Great Dane, and 

INFERNO 



snakes whose range was even great- 
er. I watched a tiny scarlet lizard 
leap from a crack in a rock to bite a 
man on the neck. The man burned 
like flash paper, dazzling me. When 
1 looked again he was congealing 
from a cloud of smoke. 

Benito was watching me, not 
them. Let him wait. 

The land was strewn with rocks 
of all sizes. A stout grayhaired wo- 
man came toward us, running a tor- 
tuous path, her eyes fixed on her 
path. It didn’t help. Somehow she 
stepped between two rocks and fell 
sprawling, yelling in despair. The 
python that had been following her 
caught up as she tried to run on the 
ruined foot. It climbed her leg and 
bit her on the navel. 

Woman and snake, they lay im- 
mobile. They began to change. 

“Allen—” 

I made a shushing gesture. They 
were changing, the snake sprouting 
arms and legs and head hair, the 
woman melting into a smooth limb- 
less shape. Presently there was noth- 
ing left of the woman. 

The slender man who had been a 
snake stood up smiling. “Thanks, 
Gladys,” he said, and walked 
away. 

“He stole her shape,” I said. 
“I’ll be buggered. He stole her 
shape!” 

“She will grow it back. In life 
she was probably a buyer of stolen 
goods, what do you call it? A 
fence.” 

“Yeah. Wow.” 

“Are you ready?” 

“Yeah.” 

I turned and followed him. Wow. 
He stole her shape. How does a sci- 
ence fiction writer explain that? A 

71 




computer-drawn hologram? Could 
be. It was pretty dark down there. 
But I didn’t believe it. 

The bridge dipped. We climbed 
down. Benito turned left on the 
ledge between the seventh and 
eighth pits. Benito was clearly un- 
easy. 

Interesting things were happening 
in the darkness on my left, but I 
looked into the darkness on my 
right, for the danger Benito ex- 
pected. 

It looked like a swarm of fire- 
flies, or like a freeway seen from an 
airplane, or — 

This aye night, this aye night, 
Every night and all. 

Fire and sleet and candle- 
light. 

And Christ recieve thy soul. 

Sleet I’d found in the Circle of 
Gluttons, and fire on the desert. 
Here at last was the candlelight: 
huge candle flames moving in dark- 
ness. 

From the next bridge it was no 
clearer. Benito kept trying to hurry 
me along. “You will not see any- 
thing here. Are you so fond of Hell 
that you would linger?’’ 

Slender flames moved down there 
in the yellow-and-black murk 
. and stopped, and clustered 
beneath us. I said, “Who are they, 
Benito?’’ 

“Dante calls this the Bolgia of 
the Evil Counselors.’’ 

“That doesn’t tell me a lot. And 
I still don’t know what you’re afraid 
of.’’ 

A voice answered from be- 
low ... a voice with little of the 
human in it. It thrummed like a 



harp. It was coming from the tip of 
one of the huge flames. “He is 
afraid of his own homecoming.” 

I looked at Benito. He nodded, 
not looking at me. 

“Come down!’’ one of the 
flames called to Benito. It was ee- 
rily compelling, that thrumming 
voice. The tip of the flame wavered, 
turned to me. “Throw him down, 
you, if you’re an American! That’s 
Mussolini! Benito Mussolini!” 
Jolted, I turned to Benito. He 
shrugged. 

Mussolini? 

Another voice thrummed from the 
pit. “You are American. I know 
your accent. Do you understand? 
That’s Mussolini! Throw the bastard 
down here where he belongs!” 
“Who are you?” 

“Does it matter? I approved the 
fire bombing of Dresden.” 

A British voice spoke from the 
flames. “And I led the mission. We 
may belong here, Yank, but so does 
that Eytie swine.” 

Benito was backing away. When 
I went toward him, he turned and 
ran. 1 caught him at the edge of the 
next pit and tripped him. He fell 
heavily to the ground and I sat on 
him. He was no match for me. 
“Mussolini!” I shouted. 

“I pulled you out of a djinn bot- 
tle!” he protested. 

“And led me here, deeper into 
Hell! I knew it all along!” Musso- 
lini. What better choice for the Dev- 
il’s agent, to wander through Hell 
corrupting souls already half cor- 
rupted? Hitler was probably loose 
too. If we’d run across him I’d have 
guessed earlier. I remembered all 
my syspicions, and all the un- 
explained things that had happened 



72 



GALAXY 




on the trip down. No wonder he 
could give orders! 

Well, I knew who he was now, 
and I knew where he belonged. We 
were at the edge of the ninth pit, 
but I took him by the heels and 
dragged him back to the eighth. He 
thrashed like a fish. He clutched at 
rocks, and pulled a couple out of 
the ground, for all the good that did 
him. 

The pit flamed beneath us with 
the crowd gathered to welcome Be- 
nito home. 

I rolled him over the edge. He 
gave a low cry as he dropped. Be- 
fore he struck bottom he burst into 
flame. His was very bright, brighter 
than most around him. 

I turned and went on. 



XXII 

I WALKED until I had to stop, until 
the ground dropped away at my 
feet. There I stood like a machine 
whose program has run out. After 
all, where would I go? 

Now I was utterly alone, with 
nobody to tell me about the geog- 
raphy of Hell, or warn me of the 
dangers — 

— or make me go deeper into 
horror after horror when all I 
wanted to do was stop. Mussolini. 
Benito Mussolini, II Duce of Italy. 
He hadn’t even tried to deny it. 

What an idiot I’d been. Why 
hadn’t I recognised him, with that 
square massive jaw and high 
forehead? I remembered reading 
about him in history books. Benito 
Mussolini had escaped from his 
castle-prison in a glider flown by 
Hitler’s Commando, Skorzeny, one 

INFERNO 



of the most romantic figures of that 
war. No wonder Benito could fly a 
glider! 

Mussolini the fascist. He invented 
fascism! Killer and leader of killers, 
thug, ally of Adolf Hitler . back 
to the anonymous flame, Mussolini, 
evil genius behind the Italian king. 
Down you go, Benito, who poured 
' me from a bottle. 

I stood there a long time before I 
realised what I was seeing. 

In the ninth pit the damned 
staggered and lurched, slipping in 
bloody mud, leaving more blood to 
make the path more slippery for 
those behind. They seemed dazed 
survivors of some lost battle. 

One showed no obvious wounds, 
except for his erect posture and 
painfully stiff walk. I stared at his 
face, where a macabre joke had 
been played. It was pale and lean, 
and calm; no one would have guessed 
that he was in pain; but the eyes 
burned with hate. The moustache 
was in an unfamiliar style, straight, 
but twice the width of his mouth. 
And the sharp white canine teeth 
protruding over his lower lip would 
have had anyone over the age of six 
shouting, “Vampire!” 

Well ahead of him was a sturdy 
fat man with a striking bearded face 
and blood running from a cut 
throat. The face was familiar. I 
studied him, trying to remember 
where I’d seen that face. 

He started back. Then he roared 
in fury wrapped in a Shakespearian 
accent. “Varlet! Who might you 
be, that stare so arrogantly at En- 
gland?” 

“Huh?” I shook myself. 

‘ ‘Carp — Carpenter. ’ ’ 

“Come down, woodworker, and 

73 




I will. have your eyes nailed shut!” 

I realised I had been staring, 
rudely, at people who had trouble 
enough without that. More of Big 
juju’s victims. ‘‘Sorry. Does it help 
if I tell you the wounds will heal?” 

I could see the shock rippling 
down the line, and suddenly they 
were all screaming curses and wav- 
ing their fists. One man threatened 
with his severed arm held like a 
club. 

‘‘Dolt! Ass who mocks us!” 
‘‘What did I say?” 

‘‘You cannot be such a fool!” 
‘England’ cried. ‘‘We are nearly 
healed now! We reach the point in 
the circle where — ” He stopped, 
looking ahead, forgetting me entire- 
ly. ‘‘I see him now,” he said in a 
voice without life or hope. 

I looked. The bridge was ahead 
of them, and under it was a king- 
sized version of all the other de- 
mons we’d passed, twenty feet tall, 
carrying a slender sword. He 
grinned, showing teeth nearly a foot 
long. 

I had to cross the bridge anyway. 
I walked toward the demon. 

He was killing them. They 
marched toward him, hanging back 
when they could until others pushed 
them ahead, and he killed them. He 
picked a man up and sliced him 
from the crotch to the throat, set 
him down and let him walk on. 
Empathic pain lashed through me, 
and a line from a joke ran crazily 
through my head. About a cowboy 
who’d been thrown onto a barbed 
wire fence. He’d shown Texas 
courage; he’d remounted the horse 
and gone on. Of course he had to 
let the stirrups out a little . 

The fat man looked sick and 



scared. His face clicked suddenly 
into place: a painting, very famous. 
Henry the Eighth. 

1 kept walking. 

I was crossing the bridge when 
Henry reached the demon. The 
sword was not a sword, I saw now. 
It was an overdeveloped fingernail 
on an overdeveloped middle finger 
as thick as a strong man’s thigh. It 
flicked like a rapier and severed 
Henry’s head, and the demon 
handed Henry his head, and Henry 
walked on. The sharp horn tip of 
the sword flicked suddenly up be- 
fore my face. 

I stopped. 

‘‘Who may you be, O priveleged 
one, who run so free through 
Hell?” 

I got my throat working. ‘‘Allen 
Carpenter.” 

‘‘Where away. Carpenter?” 

‘‘I don’t know. Inward.” With 
all the feelings that had been burnt 
out of me, one was left. Curiosity. 
Whatever Benito had planned for 
me, it lay downward, inward. 

The dead had stopped to wait, 
with understandable patience, for 
the demon to finish his conversa- 
tion. I waved downward. ‘‘Who are 
they?” 

The demon seemed in no b'.rry. 
‘‘Sowers of discord. People who 
advocated hatred, started wars, re- 
fused to end wars — you know, the 
opposite of the peacemakers. This is 
a special collection. Religious 
schizmatics. Generally founded their 
own churches for their own pur- 
poses. 

The demon looked fondly at 
“England’s” receding back. “Henry 
there wanted a divorce. The 
Church wouldn’t give him one. So 



74 



GALAXY 




he made himself a Church that would. 
Clever?” 

“On the evidence, not very.” 

The demon stooped to pick up 
the man with the Fu Manchu mous- 
tache and the vampire teeth. 
“Dracula here didn’t found any 
churches. He — ” 




Doomsday~to. He could save a 
small party of the Chosen, chosen 
by him, that is. All you had to do 
was turn all your property over to 
him.” The demon grinned enor- 
mously. “And you. Carpenter? Did 
you ever create a Church of your 
very own?” 

“I—” Oh, boy. 

The sword’s bloody tip swung 
away and back, rapier-quick. I 
ducked and ran. I fell flat on the 



‘'Draculal I thought he was — 
Dammit, he was just a legend.” 

“There are legends about him. In 
his homeland, Transylvania, 
mothers still frighten their children 
with his name. Dracula was just a 
title. Means dragon. His real name 
was Vlad; they called him Vlad 
Tepes, Vlad the Impaler. He spent 
his whole life torturing and killing 
Turks in the name of Christ. 
About half the people he killed 
were his own subjects, by the 
way.” 

Small wonder Vlad the Impaler 
walked funny. A wooden stake was 
sticking two feet , out of his anus. 
The demon didn’t need his sword. 
He just pushed the stake up until it 
didn’t show, set the man down, and 
let him walk on. Walking funny. 

The demon picked up another. 
“Johann, here, was the only man 
God would reveal the exact time of 



bridge as the sword flashed again. 
The demon couldn’t quite get at me 
at that angle. But the arch of the 
bridge dipped low, there at the end. 

I rose to sprint position, poised, 
took off. At the base of the arch the 
sword flicked toward me at knee 
height. I jumped it and kept run- 
ning, right across and into the space 
above the next pit. 

The side was steep. I hit once, 
and bounced, and hit the bottom 
very hard. 

* *• * 

There was no unconsciousness in 
Hell. There was only pain and the 
awful strain of trying to draw a 
breath. Deep down behind the pain 
a tiny voice was saying. You don’t 
need to breathe, Carpentier. You’re 
dead. But I wanted to breathe, 1 
needed to breathe and not a sip of 
air could I draw. 



INFERNO 



75 




Eventually the air did come, in 
sips, then gulps. I tried to straighten 
out. It felt as if I were breaking my 
own back. Maybe my back was 
broken. But the sword would have 
been worse. 

Could I feel my feet? Yes. 

Okay. Your spine's intact. Just 
lie here a while. It will heal. Sure, 
we always healed. 

Hey, Carpentier . Why was it Be- 
nito always healed before you did? 

■ Why shouldn’t he? He was one 
of the paid staff. 

Then why did he get hurt at all? 

A woman’s voice said, “What’ve 
you got?” 

”lJh?” I still couldn’t get more 
coherent than that. 

‘‘What’ve you got?” she repeated 
patiently. I moved my head around, 
slowly. It was dark and gloomy. 1 
became aware of hideous screeching 
sounds, moans, screams of pain and 
rage, snarling dogs, the cacaphony 
of Hell. 

She was sitting against the slop- 
ing side of the trench, naked, her 
body marked with pustules and the 
scars of older eruptions of the skin. 
She didn’t seem more able to move 
than I was. 

But the pain in my back was eas- 
ing. I said, ‘‘Broken back, proba- 
bly. What’ve yoM got?” 

‘‘Everything. Syphilis. Gonorrhea. 
Yaws. Trench mouth. Everything 
you can think of.” 

‘‘Uh huh. I know what you’ve 
been doing.” 

She wailed, ‘‘But I didn’t! That’s 
why it’s so unfair!” 

My eyes were getting accustomed 
to the gloom that hung thick down 
here in the pit. There were others 
lying about the floor and the sides 

76 



of the gully. Most of them looked 
deathly ill. 

Across from me was a man 
scrabbling among thousands of 
pills. There must have been every 
variety of medication ever invented 
or imagined: tablets, capsules of 
many hues, bottles of liquids, tiny 
pills and pills that would choke a 
horse. He groaned in pain as he 
held up a pill and squinted at it. Fi- 
nally he decided: he flung the pill 
back into the bathtub of them next 
to him. 

He sat for a moment. Then he 
moaned, pressing his hands hard 
against his belly. ‘‘It’s eating me 
alive!” he screamed. He scrabbled 
for another pill. This time he gulped 
it without looking at it. It didn’t 
seem to help, because he screamed 
even louder and went back to his 
inspection routine. 

I looked a question at the girl. 
She shrugged. ‘‘He sold cancer 
cures. They only worked if you 
didn’t go to a doctor. Somewhere in 
that pile there may be a pill that 
cures him.” 

‘‘What about the rest?” 

‘‘Some don’t do anything. Some 
make it worse.” 

1 shuddered, then froze as some- 
thing came howling past on all 
fours, foam dripping from its jaws. 
I’d thought it was an animal, but it 
wasn’t. It was a man. 

‘‘Counterfeiters. Counterfeiters 
always get rabies,” said the wo- 
man. ‘‘If they bite you it takes a 
long time to heal.” 

And I couldn’t move! There was 
nothing to do but watch. 

Men and woman with peeling 
scabs and an itch that drove them to 
tear at themselves. A man with no 



GALAXY 




ears, unable to move and screaming 
for water. 

“Listen!” he shouted. “Tell Sa- 
tan! Anyone! Tell Satan there is a 
plot to overthrow him. For water I 
will reveal the names of the plot- 
ters! Tell him!” 

They were all deathly ill and they 
were all in pain — 

— except one, and he was star- 
tling by contrast. He sat against the 
slope of the gully, a few feet from 
the girl and across from me. A 
middle-aged cherub, comfortably 
overweight, his blue eyes twinkling 
above a mad and happy smile. 

Certainly he was mad. Was it a 
sickness of the mind, or had some 
vile bacterium reached his brain? 

I had to get out of here. The 
most ferocious contagious diseases 
ever to wrack mankind were all 
around me. I tried to move, and 
stopped at once. My legs wouldn’t 
obey, and it felt as if my spine were 
being twisted in a vise. Had I 
caught something already? Spinal 
meningitis, maybe? 

The madman’s wandering blue 
eyes found me. He said, “I was a 
psychiatrist.” 

“I didn’t ask.” In fact. I’d al- 
ready learned more of Hell than I 
really wanted to know. I only 
wanted out. Don’t tell me any 
more! I closed my eyes. 

“They trusted me,” the mad 
voice said happily. “They thought 
we knew what we were doing. For 
fifty bucks an hour I listened to 
their life stories. Wouldn’t you?” 

He subsided. The woman said, 
“He’s crazy.” 

“Thanks. I really wondered about 
that,” I told her without opening 
my eyes. 

INFERNO 



“Listen, you fell in over the 
edge. Have you been upslope? Have 
you seen a lot of what’s up there?” 

“A lot.” 

“What do they do to, shall we 
say, ladies of the evening?” 

I opened my eyes. She was tense, 
waiting for my words. 

“I didn’t notice anything special 
for whores. Why?” 

“I, 1 . Listen, some girls 
don’t actually sleep with the cus- 
tomers. They take a gentleman to a 
mote, they get their money in ad- 
vance, then they disappear. Some- 
times you can do better than that. 
You’re just getting down to busi- 
ness when your boy friend walks in 
the door. You see?” 

“Sure.” I’d been robbed that 
way a couple of times in England. 

“Well,” she said, “you’d think 
that wouldn’t be as bad as being an 
actual . prostitute.” And she 
looked at me. 

Somehow the memory was very 
dim now, of a time on Earth when 
a London girl had propositioned 
me, taken my money, and vanished 
from a bathroom with an unsus- 
pected second door, leaving me in 
rage and frustrated lust. If I’d 
caught her I’d have killed her. But 
that was long ago, and nothing 
looked bad next to where I was 
now. 

So I lied. “They’d be downslope 
from here. I haven’t been there 
yet.” 

Satisfied, she sank back and for- 
got me in the examination of her 
ruined body. 

The mad psychiatrist noticed me 
again. “We were just playing,” he 
said dreamily. “Tinkering with 
something we didn’t understand. I 

77 




knew. Oh, I knew. Let me tell 
you — ” 

“Don’t tell me.” They kept hurt- 
ing at me, all of them! 

“He was a catatonic. He was like 
a rubber doll. You could put him in 
any position and he’d stay there for 
hours. We tried all sorts of things in 
those days. Shock therapy, insulin 
shock, lobotomy. Punish the patient 
for not noticing the outside world.” 

“Or for not noticing you.” 

I meant it to hurt, but he nodded 
happily. “So we put him in a hot 
box and started raising the tempera- 
ture. We watched him through a 
window. First he just sweated. Then 
he started to move around. At a 
hundred andv thirty he said his first 
words in sixteen years. ‘Get me the 
fuck out of here!’ ’ ’ 

The mad eyes found me, and his 
face seemed to cave in. The 
cherubic smile vanished. Urgently 
he said, “Get me the fuck out of 
here!” 

“1 can’t. I’ll be lucky to get out 
myself.” I tried moving again. 
There was pain, but not enough to 
keep me in that place. 1 stood, gin- 
gerly, and started up the slope. 

The girl cried, “You can’t do 
that! Come back here! Come 
back!” 

I kept going. There were rocks to 
pull myself up, cracks to use as 
footholds. I’d climbed Just far 
enough when another hydrophobia 
case raged past, biting and chewing 
on everyone he passed. A rock rolled 
from beneath my foot and pain 
grated in my spine as I caught my- 
self. 

The rabid man screamed at the 
psychiatrist, but the cherubic look 
had returned and he was smiling 

78 



dreamily at the opposite wall. When 
I reached the top I remembered who 
had been in the last pit of the 
Eighth Circle. Frauds. Falsifiers. 
False witnesses. 

XXIII 

That was the last of the Bol- 
gias. Now the way led across an 
empty, rocky land. I turned and 
looked at the ten canyons rising 
upward behind me, light flickering 
from some, others marked by rising 
smoke or roiling heated air. It had 
not been a pleasant Journey . 

Far ahead, through a twilit gloom 
that would Just have had drivers 
turning on their headlights, 1 saw 
what seemed a cluster of great tow- 
ers. There was nothing else to 
see, nothing at all. 

Benito’s evil counsel had brought 
me this far. Now it was too late. I 
could get back a little way, proba- 
bly to the fifth pit, possibly as far 
as the cliff. But I’d never talk Ge- 
ryon into taking me up that 
cliff . and there were Just too 
many places where Allen Carpenter 
might belong. 

Could I talk the monster into 
summoning Minos? That could get 
me all the way back to the Ves- 
tibule. Yeah, and into the bottle 
again. If I were lucky. I hadn’t for- 
gotten that burrowing this far into 
Hell might be a crime in itself. 
Minos had told me that I could 
choose far worse for myself than 
“Justice”. Maybe I’d already made 
the choice. 

Or ... I could Just sit down. In 
this empty borderland I could spend 
a good piece of eternity before 
some angel noticed me. 



GALAXY 




I sat down. 

It was very peaceful. 

It was, in fact, the only com- 
pletely empty spot I’d seen in Hell. 
Why? Maybe it was reserved for 
some brand new sin, something that 
hadn’t been invented yet . say, a 
development of brain research or 
genetics. At some time in the indef- 
inite future I might have to vacate 
fast. 

Meanwhile, it was better than the 
bottle. I could see my navel. 

Time passed without leaving 
footprints. Days, I think. The stinks 
of Hell were still in my nostrils. 
The ever-present background noise 
might have been soothing if I hadn’t 
known what it was: millions of 
moans and cries blended by dis- 
tance. But nobody was hurting me 
or hurting at me. I didn’t have to 
watch people getting sliced up, or 
burned, or riddled by diseases, or 
smashed by demon cars, or dis- 
torted into obscene shapes. 

1 sat and dreamed of the past. I 
wondered idly about the looming 
towers I could see m the dark dis- 
tance. I wondered at Benito’s ulti- 
mate purpose in luring me here. But 
none of it seemed to matter. I 
thought that even curiosity had been 
burned out of me. 

That would have been nice. I 
would have liked to turn my mind 
off for a long time. But it wouldn’t 
turn off. Whatever quiet I’d found 
here, there was still Hell around 
me, and I hurt with the need to 
know why. 

God had created human souls; 
could he not uncreate the failures? 
God had created sleep; could he not 
put the failures to sleep, forever? 
There were no good excuses for 

INFERNO 



Hell. I thought of some unsettling 
bad ones: 

The universe would fly off its 
axis if Hell’s agony did not balance 
Heaven’s bliss. 

Or: part of Heaven’s bliss was 
the knowledge that lots of nasty 
people were suffering terribly. 

Or the old standby: we were in- 
the hands of infinite power and in- 
finite sadism. 

1 got restless. The towers kept 
catching at my eye: blurred grey 
shadows on the horizon. Skyscrap- 
ers? A city in Hell? Quarters to 
house the maintenance crew for In- 
fernoland? Or were they the true en- 
trance, the tourist entrance? 

But I was only playing with 
plots. I didn’t believe in Infernoland 
any more. This was Hell, and I 
knew it. I finally realised what was 
really bothering me. 

To all intents and purposes I was 
back in the bottle. 

I got up. I walked toward the tow- 
ers. No harm in looking. 

* * ★ 

They weren’t towers. 

They were giants, enormous 
humanoids, buried in the earth from 
the navel down. I stopped well out 
of their reach to study them. Their 
enormous eyes found me and pinned 
me to the landscape like a but- 
terfly on a board; then shifted away. 
I was not worth their attention. 

I was glad. Unreasonably I felt 
that those tremendous deep eyes 
could see everything there was to 
know about me. 

One was mad. He looked down 
at me hopefully and said, “Ildurb 
fistenant imb?” His face fell when I 
did not respond. Alien language, 

79 




alien being. What were these aliens 
doing in human Hell? 

Not serving Big Juju. Not hardly. 
Miles of chain bound their arms to 
their sides. 

There were giants in the Bible, 
and Titans in mythology. But no ar- 
cheologist had ever found human 
bones this size. And how could they 
survive Earth’s gravity? The 
square-cube law should have flat- 
tened them into mountains of ham- 
burger. 

Maybe they weren’t from this 
universe at all. An attacking army 
from another universe made by 
another Creator? The science fiction 
writer in me, the late Allen Carpen- 
tier, wanted very much to see their 
legs and feet. They must be dispro- 
portionately large and sturdy to 
support their weight . unless 
they had developed in a lighter 
gravity field . 

While Carpentier the trapped 
damned soul was examining the 
chains that wrapped another of the 
giants. 

For the giants were buried just 
outside a chin-high wall: their 
chins, not mine. The wall looked 
too smooth to climb. 1 walked up to 
the chained giant, ready to jump, 
but it wasn’t necessary. The chain 
looked like anchor cable. Whoever 
had wrapped it round him had a 
fine eye for detail. He’d have been 
lucky to shrug his eyebrows. 

Now, what would Benito have 
done here? Climbed the giant, of 
course. 

The thought of climbing such a 
monster gave me pause. Yet I was 
sure I could do it. Up the chain, 
stepping in the links, as far as his 
shoulder; beware of snapping teeth. 

80 



Then onto the wall and down. 

If Benito had told the truth ... if 
what I remembered of Dante was 
true ... I would then be in the last 
Circle of Hell, the Circle of 
Traitors. Traitors to nation, to over- 
lord, to benefactor, to parents and 
siblings. A great ice plain, and the 
traitors embedded in it. There 
would be nothing but the cold to 
stop me from crossing it, and I 
knew I couldn’t freeze to death. 

It looked so easy. What had Be- 
nito left out? 

I remembered the great ice plain 
well enough. The college boy had 
been jolted at finding part of Hell 
already frozen over. Benito hadn’t 
said anything that jarred with my 
own memories of Dante. 

But there had to be a joker in the 
deck somewhere. Benito had been a 
power in Hell. He’d given orders to 
others of Hell’s minions. He’d dem- 
onstrated demonic strength against 
a tank of a man in the great swamp. 

Carpentier, why didn’t he do that 
to you ? 

Maybe it was guilt that stopped 
him. He’d writhed and torn at the 
ground, but he hadn’t actually hit 
me, not once. He’d uprooted jagged 
rocks while trying to use them as 
anchors, but he hadn’t tried to hit 
me with them. And for all his pre- 
sumed safe-conduct, he was back 
where Minos had sentenced him, 
with the Evil Counselors. 

Maybe Satan or God or Big Juju 
had rendered some kind of judge- 
ment against Benito. With me as 
the agent. 

But why hadn't Benito fought? 

The giant tried to shake himself. 
The chains barely rustled. 

No danger there. 



GALAXY 




You writhe and you struggle, but 
there’s no way around it. Me too, 
giant. From every possible direction 
it looked the same. It was going to 
be unreasonably easy for Allen Car- 
penter to enter the Circle of 
Traitors . the place of punish- 
ment for those who had betrayed 
their benefactors. 

I thought it over for a long time. 
Then I turned and started back. 

XXIV 

Going back was harder. The dip at 
the lower end of the tenth bridge 
was steeper, and now I was climb- 
ing it. 1 crossed the pit without 
looking dov\in, and climbed back- 
ward down the high end of the 
bridge. 

I saw the next bridge close by, 
and made for it. 

A sword’s point flicked up before 
my eyes. 1 stopped. Surely he’d 
been under a different bridge? I’d 
shewed my path deliberately. But a 
half-human, half-bestial head 
beyond the sword’s point shook it- 
self negatively. 

“You can’t go back. Carpenter.’’ 

“1 have to.’’ 

The blade hung before me, rock- 
steady. 1 could have chinned myself 
on it. I half-stepped forward and the 
blade moved too fast to follow. 
Now it pricked the tip of my nose. 

1 shrugged and turned back. 

1 took no chances. I crossed the 
inner pit again and circled through 
the wasteland beyond. Two bridges 
away, I crossed again — on my bel- 
ly. I slid down the high end of the 
bridge and kept crawling along the 
ridge above the ninth pit. He 
couldn’t be under all the bridges. 

INFERNO 



Couldn’t he just. Like the 
damned clerk. He was waiting when 
I tried to stand up. At this, the low 
side of the pit, he had the angle on 
me. “You can’t go uphill,’’ he 
said. “I really don’t know how to 
make it plainer.’’ 

“I’m from the Vestibule,’’ I 
said. “I don’t belong here.’’ 

“You never created your own 
Church, Carpenter?’’ 

Oh, dammit! “Listen, those 
weren’t in competition with God or 
anybody! All I did was make up 
some religions for aliens. If that 
was enough you’d have every sci- 
ence fiction writer who ever lived!’’ 
“We’ve got him,” said the de- 
mon, and he pointed with the 
sword. 

I forgot the sword entirely. I 
leaned far out over the edge of the 
pit to see. “What in Hell — to coin a 
phrase — is that?’’ 

It was, in a sense, the last word 
in centaurs. At one end was most of 
what 1 took for a trilobite. The head 
of the trilobite was a gristly primi- 
tive fish. It’s head was the torso of 
a bony fish . and so on up the 
line, lungfish, proto-rat, bigger rat, 
a large smooth-skinned beast 1 
didn’t recognise, a thing like a 
gorilla, a thing like a man, finally a 
true man. None of the beasts had 
full hindquarters except the trilobite; 
none had a head except the man. 
The whole thing crawled along on 
flopping fish-torsos and forelegs and 
hands, a tremendous unmatched 
centipede. The human face seemed 
quite mad. 

“He founded a religion that 
masks as a form of lay psychiatry. 
Members try to recall previous lives 
in their presumed animal ancestry. 

81 




They also recall their own past 
lives . and that adds an interest- 
ing blackmail angle, because those 
who hear confession are often more 
dedicated than honorable. Excuse 
me.” 

For the line of victims had 
bunched up while we talked. The 
demon turned and sliced at them 
rapidly, to a tune of screams and 
curses. The centaur creature he 
sliced into its seperate components, 
and it went past him in a parade, on 
arms and forelegs and wriggling 
fishy fins. The sword flicked up 
again just as I’d decided to make a 
break for it. 

A bead of blood formed at the tip 
of my nose. “I’m not like him,” I 
said quickly. “He played the game 
for real. With me it was Just a 
game.” I backed away until the 
tenth Bolgia was an emptiness be- 
neath my heels. He couldn’t reach 
me now. “Take the Silpies. They 
were humanoid, but telepaths. They 
believed they had one collective 
soul, and they could prove it! And 
the Sloots were slugs with tool- 
using tentacles developed from their 
tongues. To them, God was a Sloot 
with no tongue. He didn’t need a 
tongue; He didn’t eat, and He could 
create at will, by the power of His 
mind.” I saw him nodding, and 
was encouraged. “None of this was 
more than playing with ideas.” 

The demon was still nodding. 
“Games played with the concept of 
religion. Enough such games and all 
religions might look equally silly.” 

“You can’t do this!” I shouted. 
“Listen, there’s a friend of mine in 
the Eighth Bolgia, and it’s my fault 
he’s there, and I’ve got to get him 
out!” 

82 



“Did anyone promise you it 
would be easy? Or even possible?” 

“Whatever it takes,” I said, and 
thought I meant it. 

“Step closer.” 

I walked to the edge. Carpentier 
shows his good faith. 

The sword flashed twice. I heard 
and felt the tip grate along my ribs. 
It left two vertical slashes along my 
chest and belly. I reeled back with 
my arms wrapped around myself to 
hold my guts in. 

The demon was watching me 
steadily. What could he be waiting 
for? 

I knew. I stepped forward and 
dropped my arms. Carpentier shows 
his inability to learn. 

The sword flashed twice more, 
leaving two deep horizontal slashes, 
perhaps mortally deep. A living 
man would have fainted from 
shock. I couldn’t. 

“Games,” said the big evil 
humanoid. “Your move.” 

I studied the slashes and the flow- 
ing blood. Shock did seem to be 
slowing down my thought process- 
es, but presently I saw what he 
meant. I said, “What do I use for a 
pencil?” 

“You’ll think of something.” 

I studied my fingernails. I 
thought of something. 

I gouged a ragged X in the top 
left square of the diagram. The 
sword flashed to place an O in an 
adjacent corner. 

★ * ★ 

I climbed the first slope of the 
bridge on fingers and toes. When I 
could walk 1 held my arms wrapped 
around myself, holding me in. The 

GALAXY 




pride of my victory seemed exces- 
sive for a stupid game of tic-tac-toe. 

As I left the bridge I heard him 
call, “Carpenter?” 

I turned my head. 

“Best two out of three?” 

My imagination was dead of 
shock. The only dirty word I could 
think of was one I’d never use 
again, not after seeing the place of 
the flatterers. I just kept walking 
along the rim. 

The eighth pit was a canyon 
filled with firelight. “Benito!” My 
voice echoed hollowly between the 
canyon walls. “Benito!” • 

Some of the flames wavered. 
Thrumming voices, retarded by the 
transfer from voice to flametip, 
Moated upward. 

“Leave the damned to suffer 
alone.” 

“Benito who?” 

‘Bug off, you!” 

The canyon stretched endlessly 
away in both directions in a gentle 
curve. If it was a full circle, it 
could hold millions. How was I to 
find Benito? 

“Benito!” There was panic in 
my voice. The strain hurt my 
slashed chest. “Benito!” 

“Benito Mussolini? He just 
passed ine going that way — ” 

“No, it was the other direction.” 
“You’re both wrong. Mussolini’s 
in the boiling lake.” 

A fat lot of help I’d get here. 
And if I found him, what then? 
How was I going to get him out? 

How did he get out in the first 
place? Maybe he’d already left 
again. A frustrating thought, be- 
cause I couldn’t do a thing about it, 
and it would mean I’d played my 
game with the demon for nothing. I 

INFERNO 



hoped Benito was already out, but I 
had to assume he was still in there. 

The canyon wasn’t all that deep. 
What 1 needed was a climber’s 
rope. Yeah, an asbestos one, stupid! 
Benito was on fire! For that matter, 

I hadn’t seen any ropes anywhere. 

I thought for a second about the 
chain on the giant. It would mean 
passing the demon twice — 

No. Even if I got the chain loose, 
it was too heavy to move, and the 
freed giant would probably crush 
me for my trouble. I was glad I 
didn’t have to decide to face the 
demon’s sword again. I don’t know 
what I would have done. 

Well? Think, Carpentier! There 
are tools in Hell. Sure, boats carry 
rope. Now we’re getting some- 
where. A heavy rope, kept wet 
while Benito climbs — Wait a min- 
ute. How do we climb the cliff 
when there’s no rope yet? There 
haven’t been any boats since the 
gaudy alien Geryon took us down. 
Tackle Geryon again? 

And if it doesn’t work, back in 
the bottle while Benito burns? 

Benito was smarter than I was. 
Maybe he’d think of something. 
“Benito!” 

Mocking, thrumming voices 
answered. 

I thought of fourteen feet of 
sword blade attached to a twenty 
foot demon. Disable the demon 
(with what?), cut the blade loose 
(how?), send it down to Benito. But 
could he climb something that 
sharp? Or would he lose his fingers 
immediately? Did fingernail burn? 

Waitaminute! There were smaller 
demons, higher up, carrying iron 
pitchforks! 

I made for the bridge. In a few 

83 




steps I was running. If I slowed 
down I’d want to stop, because I 
was terrified of what I planned. 

I was in too mueh of a hurry. I 
was trotting toward the base of the 
tremendous bridge over the chasm 
of thieves when something flashed 
scarlet from behind a rock. 1 turned, 
frowning . 

. and there was agony, flash- 
ing out from my neck to engulf me 
and drown me. I felt my bones soft- 
en and bend. 

The pain drew baek like a broken 
wave receding, but it left a black- 
ened mind. I was confused; I 
couldn’t think. A homely bearded 
man bent over me, saying urgent 
words that made no sense. 

“Which way is out?’’ He was 
huge, I realised. A giant. 1 stepped 
toward him — and I was tiny and 
four-legged; my belly scraped the 
ground. A lizard. I was a lizard. 

The bearded man repeated him- 
self, enunciating each word. 
“Which way is out? How can I 
leave Hell?’’ 

Vengeance. I advanced on him. 
Bite the son of a bitch! He backed 
away, still talking, but I couldn’t 
understand him. 

He stopped and seemed to brace 
himself. 

I leapt. I sank my teeth into his 
belly. He howled, and I dropped to 
the ground, writhing in new agony. 

When my mind cleared I was a 
man. I rolled away fast from the red 
lizard and didn’t stop until there 
was a rock between us. The' lizard 
stayed where he was, watching me. 

I was making for the next bridge 
when his words came back to me. 
My dumb reptile brain had regis- 
tered them only as sounds. 

84 



“You can’t speak!’’ he’d wailed. 
Then, “Tell me! I’ll let you bite 
me, but tell me the way out!’’ 

He was a scarlet splash on a gray 
rock. Still watching me. 

I pointed downslope, toward the 
lake of ice. “There! All the way to 
the center, if I haven’t been lied to 
myself!’’ 

I glanced back once after I’d 
crossed the next bridge. The lizard 
was poised on the rim, staring 
down. As I watched, he made his 
decision. He leapt into the pit. 

Now what was that all about? 
Never mind, Carpentier , you’ve got 
other concerns . 



XXV 

Far below me, the golden monks 
stood like so many statues. Every 
couple of seeonds one or another 
would rock forward as if its base 
were unstable. The broken bridge 
dropped in a cascade of rock. 

I stopped to catch my breath 
(Habit, Carpentier! You could give 
that up), then went down the broken 
slope with some care. It would have 
been easy to break an ankle. 

I had reached the floor of the can- 
yon before I noticed that one of 
the monks had turned completely 
around to stare at me. His slate-grey 
eyes were the oldest, the weariest I 
had ever seen; and I recognised 
them. 

He said, “Didn’t you pass here a 
week ago?’’ 

“A few days, I think. And 
you’ve only come this far?’’ 

“We hurry as fast as we can.” 
The grey eyes studied me. They 
were so tired; they made me want 

GAIAXY 




to sag down and rest. “May I ask, 
what game are you playing? Are 
you a courier or something equally 
unlikely?” 

“No. I — ” Why not tell the 
truth? He wasn’t about to run tell 
someone. “I’ve got to steal a pitch- 
fork from one of the ten-foot de- 
mons in the next pit over.” 

“Don a cloak like mine,” he 
said. “See what it does to your 
sense of humor.” 

I sank down against the bank. 
Those tired eyes . “I’ll wear the 
cloak,” I said. “You get Benito out 
of the Pit of the Evil Counselors. 
Okay?” 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“I pushed a good friend into the 
Pit of the Evil Counselors. If I 
can’t — ” 

“But why would you do a thing 
like that?” 

I howled. It startled me more 
than him. I’d been about to say 
something else entirely. But no 
words came, and I threw back my 
head and howled. The tears 
.streamed down my face. 

The monk said something in a 
foreign language. He tottered to- 
ward me, and stopped. He didn’t 
know what to do. “There, there,” 
he said. “It will be all right. Don’t 
cry.” With a touch of bitterness he 
added, “Everyone will notice.” 

There was a howl as big as the 
world inside me. It wanted out, and 
it was stronger than I was. I 
howled. 

The priest muttered to himself. 
Aloud he said, “Please. Please 
don’t do that. If you will only stop 
crying, I will help you get your 
pitchfork.” 

I shook my head. I got out a 

INFERNO 



whimpered, “How?” 

He sighed. “I cannot even take 
off my robe. I do not see how I can 
help. Perhaps I could act as bait, 
somehow?” He lifted his head, his 
teeth grinding with the effort, to 
look up along the cascade of broken 
rock. 

I stood up. I patted him on his 
leaden back: Clunk, clunk, clunk. 
“You’ve got your own problems.” 
I girded up my mental loins and 
started up the slope. 

Loose rocks rolled under my feet. 
This was the high side of the gully. 
It took a long time to get to the top. 
I had just one advantage; part of the 
bridge still projected out from the 
cliff. I climbed in its shadow and 
stopped underneath. I waited. 

After all, what could a demon do 
to me? Rip me to pieces? I’d heal. 

Drop me into the pitch, forever? 

Throw me into the pit of the 
thieves? 

One of the horned black demons 
strolled past, his head turned to 
study the pitch on the other side of 
the ridge. He held six yards of iron 
pitchfork balanced in one hand. All 
I had to do was leap out and grab 
it. 

I let him go. When he was past I 
began to shake. The beast had 
three-inch claws, ten. And eight- 
inch tusks, two. And Carpentier 
was a coward. 

I heard clanking and puffing be- 
low me. I turned and saw an amaz- 
ing sight. The priest was coming up 
behind me. 

I watched him. I didn’t believe it, 
but it was true: he was actually in 
motion. He sounded as if he were 
dying again, but every so often his 
hand or his foot would move and 

85 





i / 



he’d be two inches higher. When I 
finally made myself believe what 
was happening, I scrambled down 
the cliff, got under him and pushed 
up on the rigid hem of his robe. I 
doubt it helped. I might as well 
have been trying to lift the world. 

We reached a flattish fragment of 
rock just under what was left of the 
bridge. There we rested. The death 
rattle was in his throat. His eyes 
were closed. His face glistened. 

“Thousand years,’’ he got out. 
“Been walking . thousand years 
. in this lead coffin. Legs like 
trees.’’ Then, “Was a priest. A 
priest. Supposed to . keep 
people out of Hell.’’ 

“I still don’t know how we’re 
going to do it.’’ The we was cour- 
tesy, and he deserved it. But what 
could he do? 

“Get me up,’’ he said. 



I got my arms under his robe. It 
was warm. Together we got him 
upright, somehow. Then I looked 
up ... at a demon’s hooves. 

The demon looked down at us, 
grinning. “You know,’’ he said 
pleasantly, “you’re the first one 
ever got this far out of the tar.’’ 

I said, “You’re making a mis- 
take. T’m not — ’’ Then 1 leapt for 
it. The pitchfork struck sparks from 
the rock where I’d been, but I was 
in midair, falling. 

I landed hard on a ragged-edged 
boulder. I rolled immediately, ready 
to dodge again. 

The priest was gripping the busi- 
ness end of the pitchfork! 

The demon bellowed and pulled. 
For an instant he had lifted the 
priest off the rock, robe and all. 
Then the priest sagged back, still 
gripping the tines. 

I tried to climb up to help. 

The priest took two steps back 
and off the edge of the rock. 

The demon bellowed for help. He 
was trying to lift half a ton of 
leaden robe, and it wasn’t working 
out. I had almost reached them 
when the demon cried out and let 
go. The priest dropped through 
space. 

I crawled down to him. 

The robe was bent like tinsel and 
cracked down the front. The edges 
glowed yellow. He’d been told 
wrong; the robe was solid gold. 
When I touched it it burned my fin- 
gers. 

The priest was mangled inside. 
He looked violently dead, except 
for his eyes, which followed me. If 
I didn’t get him out of the robe he’d 
fry. But you don’t move an accident 
victim — 



86 



GALAXY 




He'll heal, Carpentier. f^e all 
heal, to be hurt again. I, pulled him 
out by his feet. The robe wasn’t 
contoured to let him pass, but it 
didn’t matter. He came out like a 
jellyfish. He must have broken ev- 
ery bone in his body. 

I spoke not to the soft-looking 
head, but to the grey eyes alone. 
“You’ll heal. When you heal, 
there’s a way out of Hell. Benito 
says so. Go downhill. Downhill.’’ 
The eyes blinked. 

“I’ve got to rescue Benito,” I 
said. I pulled him over to the side 
so nobody would step on him. I 
picked up the pitchfork and left. 

* * * 

“Benito!” 

I walked the ridge between the 
pits, calling like a lost soul. The 
answering voices all sounded the 
same, anonymous, thrumming, in- 
human. “Here I am, fellah!” “Be- 
nito who?” “Who dares disturb the 
silence of Hell?” 

“Benito!” 

“Allen?” 

That had to be him! But a dozen 
voices took it up. “Allen!” “Here I 
am, Allen! What kept you?” 

“Benito! I’ve come to get you 
out!” 

I listened for the Italian ac- 
cent . and heard it. “Never 
mind. I belong here. I should not 
have tried to leave.” 

All the flames looked alike, but I 
thought I had him placed now. I 
reached down with the pitchfork. 
“Bu-ger that! Grab the end!” 

The other flames were wandering 
off. Benito said, “It is not long 
enough in any case.” 

It wasn’t. I looked along the rim. 

INFERNO 



There was a rough place where I 
might climb down partway. 

Benito tried to stop me. “You 
are being stupid. If you fall, you 
will burn like the rest of us!” 

“Can you reach the end?” 

“Go away, Allen. This is my 
proper place.” 

I was ten feet below the rim, and 
almost out of footholds. The pitch- 
fork was heavy and awkward. I 
tried to go further, setting my feet 
very carefully. 

“All right,” Benito said sudden- 
ly. The huge flame moved to engulf 
the tines. I felt a feather touch on 
the haft, and the flame began to rise 
from the pit. 

He called, “Can you hold me?” 

I laughed with relief. “You don’t 
weigh as much as an ounce! I could 
lift a thousand of you!” After all 
I’d been through, suddenly it was 
going to be easy. 

The flame rose higher along the 
haft . and I felt the first warming 
of the metal. 

* ★ * 

I waited until I was sure I could 
filter the panic from my voice. 
Some of it may have got through 
anyway. “Benito? Hurry.” 

“Is something wrong?” 

“No, never mind. Just hurry.” I 
was afraid he’d let go. 

The metal was uncomfortably 
warm. 

It grew hot. 

Down there where a huge flame 
was rising in dreamy sloth, the 
metal began to glow dull red. He 
wouldn’t notice; his own bright 
•flame would blind him to it. Up 
here it was too hot to hold, but I 

87 




held on, my teeth clenched against 
the scream. 

The scream grew bulky in my 
throat. I stopped breathing to hold it 
in. If Benito gave up now to save 
me pain, I’d never, never find the 
courage to do this twice. 

The metal was cheery red around 
the flame. My hands began to siz- 
zle. I wasn’t breathing, but the 
smell of cooked meat worked its 
way into my nose. I couldn’t 
imagine how my hands still held. I 
was clenching them with everything 
I had, but the muscles and nerves 
must be cooked through. Charred 
through. 1 knew that smell too; din- 
ner ruined. My head was thrown 
back, my eyes clenched tight. There 
was no sensation but the fire. 

“You can let go,’’ said Benito. 
He was beside me, clinging to the 
cliff, his body no longer hidden by 
the flame. 

I tried to let go. 

My hands were charred fast to 
the haft. I tried to knock the pitch- 
fork loose. It came loose, all right, 
and slid bumping into the eight 
Bolgia with my charred hands still 
attached. 

Benito had to virtually lift me up 
the cliff. 



XXVI 

WENT INWARD. I followed 
Benito, nursing my charred wrists. 
He had to haul me up the last 
bridges by the slack of my robe. 
The pain never stopped. The nerves 
gave no sign of having been 
cauterized by the red hot iron. The 
charred bone broke away; the black 
flesh split to expose red flesh. 

88 



It’ll heal, Carpentier. 

Oh, shut up. And call me Car- 
penter. Carpentier the Famous Au- 
thor is dead. 

In the empty borderland between 
the tenth pit and the giants, we sat 
down. Presently Benito spoke. 
“Thank you.’’ 

“Yeah. I’m sorry I pushed you 
in.’’ 

He didn’t say anything. I said, “I 
thought I had to do it. I thought it 
was right." 

Still nothing. “Look,” I said. “I 
was raised to believe that Benito 
Mussolini and Adolf Hitler were 
identical monsters.” 

Benito sighed. “Sometimes, to- 
ward the end, perhaps we were. I 
didn’t start that way. I meant 
well.” He laughed, bitterly. “I had 
good intentions. We know what is 
said to be paved with those.” 

“Tell me about it.” 

He spoke musingly, without look- 
ing at me. “After the War I saw 
my country humiliated. No one be- 
lieved in anything. Corruption 
everywhere, laboring people work- 
ing against wealthy people, middle 
class working against the govern- 
ment, everyone fighting each other 
and everyone ruining each other. If 
they’d only work together — we 
were Romans, once. We ruled the 
world. We could be great again, in- 
stead of a joke for Clemenceau and 
Lloyd George to swat aside.” 

“So you made people work to- 
gether?” 

“I gave Italy hope. For years I 
even stopped Hitler from taking Aus- 
tria. Allen, if I’d chosen the side 
of the Allies in fhe second war, 
would I have as great a place in his- 
tory as Stalin?” 



GALAXY 




1 couldn’t say anything to that. 
“Yet he killed ten million peas- 
ants. Adolf never equalled that rec- 
ord. As for me, in the early days 
we used castor oil, not clubs.’’ He 
sighed. “But you can never stop, 
once you begin seeing what is better 
for people than they know them- 
selves. The opposition will make a 
thorough mess of everything you’ve 
done, and you know they will de- 
stroy the country. What do you do? 
Destroy the opposition. Now they 
really have grievances. Bigger op- 
position, more police needed to 
suppress them. But I meant well. 1 
loved my people to the day they 
killed me.’’ 

“ ‘The purpose of power is pow- 
er.’ ’’ 

"‘whatl" Benito was badly 
shocked. 

“Never mind. Quote from a 
novel, 1984. So then you tried to 
set up a government here?’’ 

“For my sins, 1 did.” Benito’s 
sudden laugh was like my own 
howling in the sixth Bolgia: there 
was an agonized laugh in him, and 
it clawed its way through his throat. 
“Oh, Allen! And you think you’ve 
seen Hell! A government among the 
Evil Counselors — When 1 tried to 
get out they stopped me; they 
needed me as figurehead. Never 
mind, 1 got out anyway. 1 had to.” 
“But you never did anything but 
good for me. Or anyone else you 
met, down here.” 

“How are your hands?” 

We looked. Two tiny infant’s 
fists were forming at the lumpy 
bones of my wrists. “We must wait 
until they heal. You will never 
climb with those!” he laughed. 

We sat and talked. Hours passed. 

INFERNO 



“1 think the worst was when they 
shot my cabinet people. Italians, 
shooting men whose only crime was 
to love Italy and trust me — ” he 
shuddered. “Those are strange scars 
on your chest.” 

“I had to play games with the 
demon in the tenth Bolgia. Funny, 
we didn’t see him coming back.” 
“Games?” 

Reluctantly I told him. It could 
have been embarrassing, but it 
wasn’t. He didn’t thank me again. 
Instead he smiled and said, “Do 
you still believe that Hell is a place 
of entertainment?” 

“No. I didn’t even then. I think 
Geryon convinced me.” 

“Geryon?” 

“Yeah. You may not have 
noticed, but Geryon is the only 
nonhuman in Hell who really looks 
like an ET, an extraterrestrial, 
something from another world. He’s 
consistent. Not like those patchwork 
demons, animal traits grafted on a 
human frame. And when I climbed 
aboard him I kicked machinery 
around his waist.” 

“So?” 

I had to laugh. “Oh, really, Be- 
nito! An anti-gravity belt? When 
they’ve already proved they can 
take the mass and weight out of 
anything they like? Geryon was ly- 
ing. Lying without saying a word.” 
“And it was Geryon that con- 
vinced you? You have seen no 
proper miracles?” 

I told him where the pitchfork 
had come from. “That priest 
climbed the broken bridge in half a 
ton of gold. He hung from the de- 
mon’s pitchfork until the demon had 
to let go, and he knew what would 
happen then.” 

89 




Benito smiled. “Yes, that was a 
miracle.” 

“Too right. I know a miracle 
when 1 see one.” 

“Then you are more fortunate 
than most of us.” He looked 
thoughtful. “Geryon has looked a 
little different each time I have seen 
him.” 

“That worried me too. Just how 
often have you made this trip?” 

“Six times. Each has been easier 
for me, although not for the one 
who accompanied me to the exit. 
As I told you, it does not matter 
how many start. Only one leaves.” 
“And there really is a way 
out . There was a time when I 
thought you were just leading me 
into something more horrible. I’m 
still scared, but not of that.” 

“Now there remains only the 
lake of ice. You have nothing to 
fear.” 

“I’m afraid to relax. Too often 
I’ve thought I was through the 
worst part.” 

His look probed my soul. “When 
the iron began to grow warm in 
your hands — ” 

“Tell me all about it.” 

“I think not. But now there is 
only the ice. It will be colder than 
anything you can magine, but we 
can endure it. Nothing can bar us 
now! Soon we reach the center, and 
then — ” He stopped. 

“And then?” 

“You will see.” He looked me 
in the face. “I think you have 
enough courage.” 

“Even now I feel it leaking 
away. Spit it out, Benito.” 

“We will meet Lucifer, and pass 
him. Ignore anything he says. When 
we have passed that, go uphill to 

90 



Purgatory.” He paused. “Without 
me.” 

“But you’ve travelled this route? 
You know where it leads?” 

“No, and yes. I have not traveled 
it, but I know where it leads.” 
“How?” 

“By faith, and by Dante’s de- 
scription.” 

“Dante’s been wrong a couple of 
times. Admit it, Benito: you don’t 
know what happened to those six 
you rescued.” 

“I know. But I have not seen.” 
“Do you want to leave Hell? Or 
are you afraid of what’s there?” 
“How are your hands?” 

They were a child’s hands now, 
still too small to support my weight. 

“You didn’t answer my ques- 
tion.” 

“I would leave Hell if I could. I 
belong here, so long as there are 
lost souls to be rescued.” 

“You sent six men and women 
into the unknown, but you were 
afraid to go yourself.” 

He didn’t answer, only looked at 
me. 

I stood up. “Come on. My 
hands’ll heal before we need 
them.” 

♦ ★ ★ 

They healed. 

We climbed the torso of a 
chained giant. It was easier than 
mountain climbing, and harder: 
mountains don’t shake, mountains 
don’t snap at you with teeth the size 
of medieval shields. 

We stepped across space from the 
giant’s shoulder to the flat top of a 
wall. From the wall I watched Be- 
nito slide down on the seat of his 
pants, if he’d been wearing pants. 

GALAXY 




A pity he hadn’t found a better way 
down in six previous trips. 

I slid after him. 

Imagine one of the Great Lakes 
frozen over, seen on a moonless 
night. Maybe it looked like that. I’d 
never seen any of the Great Lakes. 
To me it was an ice skating rink for 
a society of teleports: bit enough to 
hold, say, one percent of a popula- 
tion of five billion. The wall behind 
me seemed arrow-straight; the 
dark ice, infinite. 

A breath of a breeze whispered 
around us and leeched all the 
warmth from our massless souls. I 
stiffened with the shock, then 
crouched down and tried to shelter 
in my own arms. 

Benito was standing. “That will 
not help. Nothing helps,” he said 
patiently. “You must bear the 
cold.” 

If he could do it ... I stood up, 
and closed my eyes tight against the 
soft, unreasonably cold breeze. 
Surely it was below freezing, way 
below freezing. How cold was it? If 
it could kill a man in minutes, or 
seconds. I’d never know it. I 
couldn’t die. 

“Benito? Burst into flame again 
for your good friend.” 

“I would if I could. My 
apologies, Allen.” Benito took my 
arm. We walked. 

It had certainly been worth ask- 
ing. 

Was it water ice we walked on? 
For all of me, it could have been 
dry ice, or frozen nitrogen, or 
something even colder. 

I kicked something that cursed 
me without emotion. I tried to open 
my eyes. The wind’s tears had fro- 
zen them shut. I pulled them open, 

INFERNO 



painfully, with my fingers. 

“Leave them open,” Benito said, 
“and they will freeze open.” 

When the urge came to blink I 
fought it. Then there was no need, 
for my eyes would not close. I 
looked back at what I’d kicked. I 
said, “Sorry.” 

The face was handsome, photo- 
genic, dignified in middle age, un- 
dignified in the way it grimaced and 
bent to the ice for shelter. Had I 
seen that face sometimes, on televi- 
sion? Maybe. The man was buried 
to his chin in the ice. At the sound 
of my voice he cried, “Wait! Are 
you american?” 

“Aren’t we all? I can’t seem to 
find anything but.” 

The head called to another head 
sitting like a cabbage on the ice. 
“George! Maybe we can settle this 
now.” It turned back to me. “Late 
american? Do you know anything 
about the ABM controversy?” 
“Sure. Anti-ballistic missiles to 
knock down incoming missiles. The 
controversy was over whether to 
build the ABM system.” 

“Wonderful! All right, sir. 
George was a Democrat, and I was 
a Republican. The Democrats were 
against building the system. The 
Republicans were in favor of it. But 
which of us was right?” 

“I haven’t the faintest idea,” I 
said. “Do you really have nothing 
better to talk about than that?” 
“No!” the man I’d kicked said 
sharply. “We do not! One of us 
had to be right! So why are we both 
here?” 

The cold wasn’t just getting to 
me; it had gotten me. I wanted out, 
not conversation. I said, “Other 
crimes, maybe.” 

91 




“One of us was wrong,” George 
said. “Senator Gates here thought 
the system was a waste of money, 
but he went along with his party. 
He—” 

“It was more than a waste of 
money! It used up efforts we could 
have spent on a laser system! Sir, 
I’ve seen how accurate a laser de- 
fense system could be against in- 
coming missiles. But politics dic- 
tated that I must support the ABM 
system. I went along.” 

“I don’t know anything about the 
damned lasers,” George said, “ex- 
cept they were highly experimental. 
Experimental weapons did a lot for 
the Nazis, didn’t they?” He snorted 
contempt, then sneezed on the 
freezing air. “I was convinced that 
the ABM system was needed to de- 
fend the country against an atomic 
attack. But our party platform was 
in favor of military cutbacks. Offi- 
cially, so was I.” 

“Now, sir,” Senator Gates said 
to me, “we can’t both have been 
wrong.” 

“I think I’m getting the picture. 
You both thought you were 
wrong.” 

”... yes.” 

“And a mistake could wipe out 
the United States of America.” 

Neither answered. 

“For what it’s worth,” I said, 
“we’re still getting Americans in 
Hell. Corbett died much later than 
you.” 

“Thank you,” said ex-Senator 
Gates, and they both turned their 
faces to the ice again. 

“But yoir were both traitors in 
your minds.” 

“Thank you for your help,” said 
George. It was a dismissal.

it -k ir 

We walked with care, to avoid 
kicking heads. There were certainly 
enough of them. But now it was 
worse; here the dead had been 
buried supine, and we would have 
been stepping on faces. 

Once I missed my step and came 
down hard on a human face. The 
ice across its eyes crackled under 
my feet, and I leapt back fast. 
“Sorry!” 

“Thanks,” I heard. 

“Mistake.” 

“Thanks, oh, thanks,” it said, 
weeping. “I haven’t cried in years. 
The damned ice froze across my 
eyes and I couldn’t cry. Thanks.” 

I felt awful. This was an awful 
place. “That’s okay,” I said. I bent 
and picked the remaining shards of 
ice from her eyes. “What’d you 
do?” 

“I don’t want to say.” 

“Okay.” 

I tore the ice visors from a couple 
of dozen pairs of eyes. Always they 
froze over again almost immediate- 
ly. Only one ever said “Thanks.” 
Finally I gave it up. There were just 
too many. 

And the next head I passed 
screamed, “The ice! Stupid! Tear 
off the ice! You did it for the 
others!” 

I stopped. “Who’re you?” 

“None of your business!” 

I turned away. 

“The ice! Wait! A1 Capone, I’m 
A1 Capone! You want names? 
That’s Vito Genovese, trying to 
turn his face! Wait, I’ll show you 
Lepke! Wait!” He was shouting 
against a chorus of voices trying to 
drown him out. I kept walking. 

GALAXY 




When the noise was behind us 
Benito said, “I knew Vito 
Genovese.” 

‘‘Was he worth talking to?” 

‘‘No. Were you thinking of going 
back? It’s cold, Allen.” 

Sound whispered all around us. 
Partly it was the breeze, which had 
stiffened. Partly it was the chatter- 
ing of teeth. I’d suppressed that re- 
flex in myself; it wasn’t warming 
me at all. 

But in all that expanse of ice, 
there was only one point of motion. 
I caught it in the corner of my eye, 
way off to one side. Doubted my 
senses. Kept looking. Saw it again. 
‘Benito?” I pointed. 

He found it. ‘‘I had no idea. I 
thought I was the only one.” 

‘‘You may be. It seems to be one 
man. And a dog.” 

They had noticed us, and they 
angled to meet us. As they came 
closer I saw my mistake. The dog 
was a lizard, its scarlet color 
leeched from it by the cold. And 
the man was the blackbearded thief 
who had stolen my shape at the 
seventh pit. 

We studied each other. No greet- 
ing seemed appropriate. Finally 1 
gestured and said, ‘‘Benito Musso- 
lini. I’m Allen Carpenter.” 

‘‘Jesse James. This lizard is Bob 
Ford.” 

‘‘What was that all ^bout, that 
business there at the bridge?” 

‘‘A bunch of us got together,” 
said Jesse. ‘‘We thought maybe we 
could cooperate in getting one of us 
out. It turned out a man couldn’t 
throw a lizard far enough. But we 
could stand a human pyramid 
against one of the walls, and the top 
man could throw a lizard at the 



bridge. I was the lizard.” 

‘‘Funny nobody thought of it be- 
fore.” 

He sighed. ‘‘It’s getting those 
animals to work together, that’s the 
problem. All the time we were try- 
ing to make the pyramid, some of 
us in the lizard form kept biting the 
ones in human form. We didn’t get 
anything done till we had a dozen 
big lizards to guard us while we 
made the pyramid.” 

‘‘Figures. Why’d you jump 
back?” 

‘‘I had to tell them which way 
was out.” 

‘‘You might not have got out 
again, They might not even have let 
you take human form again.” 

He nodded. 

I remembered something. A line 
from a song. ‘It was little Robert 
Ford, that dirty little coward, I 
wonder how does he feel, for he ate 
of Jesse’s bread, and he slept in 
Jesse’s bed, and he laid Jesse James 
in his grave . .’ ‘‘Bob Ford. 
Didn’t he kill you? Shot you while 
you were taking a bath?” 

‘‘Hanging a picture. Yeah, he 
shot me, all right. I was following 
your advice — for which I thank 
you. Stranger.” He laughed. ‘‘And 
there was Bob Ford’s head sitting 
on the ice. I thought it over for 
awhile. I wandered around and 
around him, wondering what I 
could do to him, and wondering if I 
still hated him. ’’The lizard was 
rubbing affectionately against his 
leg. ‘‘I finally bit him on the 
nose.” 

It hit me like a stiff shot of good 
whiskey. ‘‘You can get out of the 
ice!” 

‘‘Sure, friend. I just reached into 

93 



INFERNO 




that man-shaped bubble and picked 
up a lizard. Well, which way 
now?” 

“Inward,” Benito said. “Let us 
go. It is cold here.” 

That had to be the most unneces- 
sary statement of all time. We 
moved inward, and the wind came 
up. It was blowing right in our 
faces. Pretty soon it was a real 
howler, as bad as the circle of the 
winds. 1 wondered if Corbett had 
ever got back there . 

The wind whistled past us and 
lifted Jesse off the ice. The lizard 
squealed and leaped after him, and 
the wind caught it too. Man and 
lizard were bowled end over end 
across the ice, then lifted and flung 
high outward. I watched them 
dwindle. 

“So close,” 1 said. “They were 
so close!” 

“They were not ready,” Benito 
said. “Perhaps they must see what 
is done to others. Theft and 
treachery may not have been all 
they did. It is even possible that 
they will be blown all the way back 
to the Vestibule and must make 
their way back. Come.” 

“But—” 

“They know the way, Allen. 
Come!” 

“All right.” We bowed our 
heads against the wind and 
staggered on. The wind had been 
entirely too selective for coinci- 
dence. It had thrown Jesse and Ford 
an unguessable distance without 
knocking me or Benito off our feet. 
I thought it was a good omen 
. for us. 



XXVII 



Suddenly there were no more 
heads. There was only the ice, and 
the wind that had blown the others 
away. We leaned into it and kept 
moving. 

1 said, “Hell has run out of 
sins?” 

“Look down.” 

Hell had not run out of sinners. 
They were buried beneath the ice in 
weird positions. Once 1 looked 
down, and then no more. 

We walked crouched, wrapped in 
our own arms, to no purpose. The 
wind had early sucked every erg of 
heat out of us. 

I saw motion ahead, high up. 

As we drew near a shadowy mass 
loomed around the suggestion of 
motion. Pterodactyls on a moun- 
tain? Restless, rhythmic motion, 
like the wings of enormous birds. 
And gradually it all came clear. 

There was a humanoid form, a 
hairy torso more than a mile tall. 
We stood at the bottom, at waist 
level, and looked up at three vast 
faces whose features were almost 
lost in distance. Bat-wings flapped 
on either side of each face; and the 
wind was now beating down at our 
heads. 

This was a very different picture 
from the dapper gentleman who of- 
fers to buy your soul. Or from Mil- 
ton’s epic hero, proud and unrepen- 
tant. 

One could not imagine playing 
riddles or chess games with this 
hideous, miserable, helpless moun- 
tain. I studied it almost without 
fear. 

All three pairs of jaws were mov- 
ing in the same rhythm as the 
wings. Something fluttered around 
the lips .

GALAXY 




“Benito, what’s he chewing 
on?” 

“Are you sure you want to 
know?” 

“Skip it. Which way is out? 
Hey — ” I reached to stop him, not 
fast enough. Benito was striding 
straight toward Lucifer. 

He stopped at the edge of the ice. 

The ice ended short of Lucifer 
himself. There was three feet of 
empty space all around the enor- 
mous waist. 

An no navel. I couldn’t have 
missed it. It would have been big 
enough to hide a battleship. 

“You must climb down,” said 
Benito. 

I looked into the gap. “After 
you.” 

He shook his head. “I cannot 
leave. There are others to rescue.” 

“I don’t go without you.” 

“You have not shown such fear 
before.” 

“It’s not all fear. You’ve rescued 
seven of us, now rescue yourself. 
You’ve earned it. If this doesn’t 
lead to where you think it does, we 
can help each other get back.” 

“What if I turn back now, leav- 
ing you here?” 

I’d wondered about that myself. 
“I don’t know, and that’s the truth. 
But there’s a moral problem. 
You’re a better man than I am — ” 

He smiled sardonically. “I? The 
murderous dictator you pushed into 
the eighth pit?” 

“You’ve changed since you 
reached Hell. You’ve given me no 
evil counsel. I guess that’s the 
point. If you haven’t changed in 
Hell, if you haven’t earned the right 
to leave, then I haven’t and won’t. 
If you can’t go, I can’t.” 

INFERNO 



“I, I think I can go. I choose not 
to.” 

“If you can leave Hell, you’ll 
have to prove it.” 

He studied my face . and then 
he smiled a joyful, luminous smile. 
He turned and stepped across the 
gap and had two fistfuls of coarse 
hair. And a sound beat down at our 
heads, a wind with an almost sub- 
sonic voice in it. 

“Carpentier.” 

I looked straight up. Lucifer’s 
middle face was looking down the 
curve of Lucifer’s chest. Two flut- 
tering human legs protruded like a 
ghastly cigarette from the corner of 
the mouth. It spoke, and the deep 
bass voice blew down to me. 

“What will you tell God when 
you see Him?" 

I didn’t answer. 

“Will you tell Him that He could 
learn morality from Vlad the Im- 
paler?’ ’ 

Benito was far below, clinging 
like a tick in the billowing hair, 
waiting for me. I stepped across and 
worked my way down. As I did, 
my weight seemed to increase, 
against all the laws of physics. It 
scared me. I was back in Inferno- 
land, climbing down into the quan- 
tum black hole Big Juju had used 
for artificial gravity . 

Benito looked up at me curiously. 
“What did he say to you?” 

I shook my head. We descended 
until all weight was centered at my 
navel. No quantum black hole 
crushed and swallowed me. I hadn’t 
really expected one. I watched Be- 
nito work his way around until his 
feet pointed at me. I followed his 
example. 

Now we climbed up. At one 

95 




point I found breath to laugh at the 
picture we would have made: two 
men in nightshirts climbing at least 
half a mile of hairy leg. I half- 
expected to pass a dong the size of 
the Empire State Building, but there 
was nothing but hair. 

The climb seemed endless, but it 
ended, not in ice but in an echoing 
grotto of rock. And the Devil’s 
hooves still loomed over us, hooves 
big enough to stamp a city flat. 

We rested flat on our backs on 
the rock. Presently I heard running 
water. 1 got up and found the 
stream and drank from it. The water 
was clear and sweet. 

Benito was on his feet. “On- 
ward!” he cried. He began to climb 
the sides of the grotto. The hand- 
holds were not difficult, and he 
moved like a spider monkey, or like 
a fat man who no longer weighs 
anything at all. 

He looked down from the roof of 
the grotto. It didn’t end; it dwindled 
into a funnel shape that narrowed 
and narrowed but never quite shut. 

“A four thousand mile climb, if 
Dante was half right!” he bellowed 
cheerfully. “Are you coming?” 

“Tm afraid not.” 

“What did you say?” 

“No!” 

1 sighed in exasperation when I 
saw him climbing back down, but 
I’d half-expected it. He dropped the 
last few feet, and it did seem he fell 
like a settling balloon, too slowly. 
“What was it Lucifer said to you?” 
“He asked me what I would say 
to God.” 

“Well?” 

“I have to know something be- 
fore I can speak to God at all.” 
Benito waited. 



“I have to know the purpose of 
Hell.” 

“When you reach Him you can 
ask Him.” 

“You don’t get it. Every torture 
in Hell was too much too late. 
Punishment? But it’s infinite 
punishment for things that are little 
in comparison. Dracula caused a lot 
of people a lot of pain and death, 
but it ended. George only lied to 
people to make them buy things! 
And, and what about the fat lady in 
the Vestibule area? 

“So what’s the purpose? To 
teach us a lesson? But we’re dead. 
Revenge, punishment? Completely 
out of proportion. Balance? Does 
the universe need as much pain in it 
as pleasure? I couldn’t take Heaven 
if that was the case.” 

“There is a reason, and the 
reason is good. I know." 

“Yeah? 1 don’t. There’s only one 
excuse for Hell, and 1 almost 
missed it in the ravings of a crazy 
psychiatrist. It has to be the final 
training ground. If nothing can get a 
soul into Heaven in its life, there’s 
still Hell, God’s last attempt to get 
his attention. Like a catatonic in a 
hot box, like me in that bottle, if 
Hell won’t make a man yell for 
help, then it was still worth a try.” 
Benito was nodding. “You may 
be right. You may have found the 
purpose of Hell.” 

“Yeah. Yeah, but do you see 
what it means? It means that every 
^soul in Hell has to be able to leave, 
once he’s learned enough about 
himself. Every soul, even the trees 
in the Wood of the Suicides, even 
the poor devils in the boiling pitch 
and the sullen types anchored under 
the lake. Even the ones who think 



96 



GALAXY 





they’re satisfied, the ones in the 
First Circle. And I can’t leave Hell 
until I’m sure they can do it.” 
Benito nodded. “We go back.” 
“No, no, you idiot!” I was furi- 
ous. “How can I tell anyone he can 
leave unless I know you did? 
You’re going up! And I’m going to 
watch you do it!” 

“Carpenter, you must still learn 
humility.” 

“Granted. And you?” 

“But they need me. They . 
ah. They have you.” 

“They have me.” 

He shook my hand. He began to 
climb. 



I lay flat on the rock, not far 
from a rank-smelling wall of hair. 



There hadn’t been many places to 
rest in Hell. 

Benito had grown tiny when a 
pinpoint of light appeared beyond 
him. It brightened . and I knew 
that I was seeing the sun. 

He’d made good progress before 
it dimmed and went out. 

Much later, it appeared again. I 
found a speck next to it, that moved 
if 1 watched it long enough. 

The light went out. When next it 
brightened there was a tiny mote in 
it, that moved. The light was dim- 
ming with sunset when the mote 
moved out of it and left it clear, ir

JERRY POURNELLE Ph. D. 



A STEP 

FARTHER 



IN 

THE 

BEGINNING. 

First, let me establish some- 
thing. When I go to Cal Tech I do 
not expect an experience out of H. 
P. Lovecraft. Horror may be in- 
teresting at the proper time and 
place, but it’s not very pleasant as a 
total surprise. 

It started peacefully enough. Dr. 
Robert Forward, the Hughes Re- 
search gravity expert you’ve heard 
of here and other places, called to 
ask if I would be interested in meet- 
ing Stephen Hawking. Since Hawk- 
ing is considered by important 
physicists to possibly rank alongside 
Newton and Einstein, it took 
perhaps five milliseconds to think 
over the proposition. I didn’t even 
need to look at my calendar; noth- 
ing I had planned could be that 
important. 

A week later Larry Niven and I 
drove over to the California Institute 
of Technology. It was a bright 
spring afternoon. 

In order properly to tell this story 
I must now give some personal de- 



OUT 

tails about Professor Hawking. I’ve 
consulted his friends, who assure 
me that he doesn’t mind. 

Stephen Hawking is quite young, 
early thirties at the oldest. He is a 
resident theoretician at Cambridge 
University, and he yearly produces 
marvels in astronomical theory, par- 
ticularly in the field of black-hole 
dynamics. 

GALAXY readers will recall a 
previous column in which I de- 
scribed Hawking’s fiery marriage of 
quantum mechanics to Einstein’s 
classical relativity theories, to pro- 
duce the startling prediction that 
black holes are unstable. (FUZZY 
BLACK HOLES HAVE NO HAIR, 
GALAXY, Jan. 1975) He is also re- 
sponsible in large part for the so- 
called “laws of black-hole 
dynamics’’. An important man in- 
deed. 

Alas, Professor Hawking suffers 
from a nervous-system disorder 
which severely impairs his speech 
and confines him to a wheel chair. 



98 




Those who attend his lectures are 
warned that they must listen closely; 
he can be understood, but only with 
difficulty and concentration. Of 
course, given the subject matter, 
this would be true if he spoke with 
the oratorical clarity of a William 
Jennings Bryan to such bards of the 
sciences as Larry and me; we were 
prepared to be doubly confused. 

Cal Tech’s architecture is a neat 
blend of Old California and modem 
LA; arched thick-walled Monter- 
rey-style buildings with large 
shaded porches alternate with steel- 
and-glass towers and clean-lined 
functionalism. It sounds horrible, 
but the effect is actually quite pleas- 
ing. It’s a nice place to be, espe- 
cially if you’re looking forward to 
hearing one of the truly great men 
of our time. 

The lecture was in a small mod- 
em slant-floored room of the type 
sometimes called lecture theaters; 
the sort of classroom lecturers like. 
The tiered seats let everyone have a 
good view of the speaker and his 
materials, and give the speaker a 
good view of the audience. 

It was only partly filled: graduate 
students, several undergraduates, a 
sprinkling of faculty, one or two of 
the top names in theoretical physics. 
It was a room of serious women 
and men, mostly younger than I, all 
expectantly quiet. At the bottom of 
the well, the focus of attention on 
the stage, was an incredibly thin, 
very young-appearing man seated in 
a high-backed motorized chair of 



Victorian design; the chair had no 
flavor of the hospital about it. He 
wore a light suit, dark shirt, and 
flowered tie, and he kept his hands 
folded carefully in his lap as he was 
introduced. 

The chairman gave his credits 
and spoke wonderingly of how 
privileged we were to hear a man of 
this stature. No one disagreed. Not, 
of course, that anyone would have 
said anything no matter what he 
thought, but the total silence in the 
room was an obvious sign of 
unanimous assent. 

Hawking began to speak. 
Everyone leaned slightly forward, 
straining to hear. Except for the 
heavily slurred voice there was ab- 
solutely no sound; you could quite 
literally hear a pen drop, for I drop- 
ped mine and it clattered loudly on 
the cement floor. 

This is the scene, then: a lecture 
room partly filled with very bright 
people, a few extremely well known 
in theoretical physics, others stu- 
dents at one of the world’s most 
prestigious institutions. They all 
strain to hear a wizened young man 
who makes awkward gestures and 
speaks with a thick slur that keeps 
his words Just at the edge of intel- 
ligibility. 

He grins like a thief. He’s obvi- 
ously not in pain and he doesn’t 
feel sorry for himself. And he tells 
that room of bright, highly educated 
people that everything they thought 
they knew is nonsense. And he 
chuckles. 



99 




He tells us that the pudding that 
ate Chicago may some day exist; 
that duplicates of each one of us 
may one day wander the universe; 
that anything can, and probably 
will, happen. He tells us that the 
universe isn’t lawful, never will be 
lawful, never can be lawful; that we 
cannot ever know enough to predict 
the totality of events in this uni- 
verse; that at best we study local 
phenomena that may be predictable 
for an unspecifiable time. 

And he laughs. 

He tells us that Cthulthu may 
exist after all. 

As I said, it was an afternoon of 
Lovecraftian horror. Larry and I es- 
caped with our sanity, after first, in 
the question period, making eertain 
that Hawking really did say what 
we thought he’d said. 

He had.

Stephen Hawking’s lecture had 
originally been entitled “The 
Breakdown of Physics in the Region 
of Space-Time Singularities.’’ The 
title was flashed on the screen; then 
another slide took its place, and 
Hawking chuckled. The new slide: 

THE BREAKDOWN OF PHYSICISTS 
IN THE REGION OF 
SPACE-TIME SINGULARITIES 

He began simply enough. The 
prineiple of equivalence, he said, is 
well established. This is the princi- 
ple that states that inertial mass, 

100 



that is, the resistance of objects to 
being moved by an outside force, is 
exactly equivalent to gravitational 
mass, that is, the gravitational force 
a given mass will exert: there is 
only one kind of mass. 

This was Galileo’s Principle, and 
the source of the famous if apoc- 
ryphal story of his dropping a 
cannon-ball and a musket-ball from 
the Leaning Tower of Pisa and ob- 
serving them striking the ground at 
the same time. Obviously if gravita- 
tional and inertial mass were differ- 
ent, heavy objects would not fall at 
the same speed as light ones. 

So far so good. Next, gravity af- 
fects light. It can bend light rays, as 
predicted by Einstein and observed 
several times in solar eclipses. 

Now in short order: the energy- 
momentum tensor of gravity is posi- 
tive; gravity is universally attrac- 
tive, not repellent. Therefore, 
enough mass will create a field 
from which no light can escape. 

The Special Theory of Relativity 
says that nothing can travel faster 
than light. 

And therefore sufficient mass 
must create a space-time 
singularity — a place which cannot 
be observed. 

A singularity is therefore inevita- 
ble; that is, one must exist, pro- 
vided only: (1) that Einstein’s gen- 
eral relativity is correct; (2) gravity 
is truly attractive and never repel- 
lent) and (3), enough mass has ever 
been collected together. 

And therefore at least one singu- 

GALAXY 




larity exists in our universe, since at 
the time of the Big Bang all the 
conditions certainly prevailed; and 
also, it’s very likely that other sin- 
gularities have been created by col- 
lapse of stars, since many stars have 
more than enough matter and don’t 
have enough energy to throw that 
matter away as they die. 

* * * 

Okay so far? Nothing startling 
here. Bit dry, but all we’ve proved 
is that singularities must exist, and 
heck, nearly everyone accepts the 
idea now. They’re hidden away in- 
side black holes, of course, and ob- 
servers are now very nearly certain 
that we can observe a black hole. 

Well, not observe the hole itself; 
but Cygnus X-1, an x-ray emitting 
star in the constellation Cygnus, has 
an invisible companion and the pair 
of stars, the one we can see and the 
one we can’t, together act very like 
what Cal Tech’s Kip Thome pre- 
dicted such a pair would act like if 
one were a black hole. 

So what else is new? We’ve 
proved black holes can exist, and 
lo, the observers think they’ve 
found one. What’s scary about thatl 

Nothing, so far. Holes aren’t 
scary unless you’re about to fall 
into one. We even understand them. 
We know they “have no hair,’’ that 
is, that they can be completely de- 
scribed given their mass, M; angu- 
lar momentum, J; and electric 
charge, Q. Given these data we can 
describe their shape, and predict 

A STEP FARTHER OUT 



what effect they’ll have on nearby 
objects, and play all kinds of fas- 
cinating scientific-theory games. 

We can talk about black hole 
bombs, and toy with ideas on how 
to extract energy from them: take 
one rotating black hole, throw gar- 
bage into it, and you not only get 
rid of the garbage, but can get use- 
ful energy back out. There are 
speculations (not SF; Just plain sci- 
ence) about extremely advanced 
civilizations using black holes for 
precisely that purpose. 

There’s Just no end to the nice 
things you could do with black 
holes, and although not many years 
ago they were no more than toys for 
theoreticians to play mental games 
with, black holes have become 
household-word objects now. 

Black holes don’t make us ner- 
vous. 

Ah, but inside each black hole 
there lurks a singularity. This is the 
little beastie that breaks down 
physics in the nearby regions. By 
definition they do things we can’t 
predict. They behave in strange 
ways. Up close to them time rever- 
sals can happen. How, then, can we 
avoid this breakdown of our nice 
predictable universe? 

Hawking discussed several 
theoretical alternatives, and dismiss- 
ed each. A couple of the cases 
seemed to startle one of the big- 
name theoreticians listening to the 
lecture. When Hawking was 
finished, though, the singularities 
were back and inevitable. I won’t 



101 




pretend to have understood all of 
this part of the lecture; and I 
wouldn’t bore GALAXY readers 
with it if I had. If you appreciate 
that sort of thing you’ll read Hawk- 
ing’s paper when it conies out. 

For the rest of us I sum up by 
saying that he found no good alter- 
natives; eliminating General Relativ- 
ity doesn’t eliminate the sin- 
gularities, or el.se lands you in an 
even worse theoretical soup. 

Therefore, let us look at General 
Relativity; but let us add quantum 
theory to it. Hawking recently pub- 
lished that work, and I described it 
here in January. 

The important fact is that the 
quantum effects violate cosmic cen- 
sorship. The Law of Cosmic Censor- 
ship, you may recall (December 
1974 GALAXY) states that there 
shall be no naked singularities; ev- 
ery singularity shall be decently 
clothed with an event horizon that 
prevents us from ever being able to 
observe it directly, and thus pre- 
vents us from observing the region 
in which physics breaks down. 

Thus we needn’t fear the singu- 
larity. It can’t affect our lives, be- 
cause nothing it does can get out of 
that black hole “around” it. 

But adding quantum effects to 
General Relativity repeals cosmic 
censorship. Black holes evaporate. 
Big ones slowly, small ones rapid- 
ly, all inevitably. And what of the 
singularity that MUST have been 
created by the Big Bang of cre- 
ation? 

102 



Evaporation of black holes pro- 
duces naked singularities. We may 
play about with the concept of 
quantizing relativity, and Hawking 
did; but the conclusion was inescap- 
able. Again I don’t pretend to have 
followed every step, nor did most 
of the rest of us in that room; but 
several did, and they weren’t 
pleased. 

Because now comes the punch- 
line. The singularities emit matter 
and energy. And “they emit all 
possible configurations with equal 
probability. Perhaps this is why the 
early universe from the Big Bang 
singularity was in thermal equilib- 
rium, and was very nearly 
homogeneous and isotropic; thermal 
equilibrium would represent the 
largest number of configurations.” 

But since that time the universe 
has changed, and we have stars and 
planets and nematodes and comets 
and great whales (for a little while 
longer) and people; but the singular- 
ity must still be around. It emits. 
And what comes out is completely 
random, absolutely uncorrelated. 
This fundamental breakdown in 
prediction — Hawking is saying not 
only that we can’t predict now, but 
that in priciple we can never pre- 
dict, no matter how much we know 
or how smart we get or how large a 
computer we build — is a “conse- 
quence of the fact that General 
Relativity allows fundamental 
changes in the topology of space-time; 
that is, allows holes. 

“Matter and information can fall 

GALAXY 




into these holes — or can come out. 
And what comes out is completely 
random and uncorrelated.” 

The hole can emit anything. Any- 
thing at all. 

“No,” I thought. I looked to Ni- 
ven. “No,” he was thinking. 
Surely we misunderstood. 

And the thin chap grinned ever 
more broadly. “Of course we might 
have to wait quite a while for it to 
emit one of the people here this af- 
ternoon, or myself, but eventually it 
must — ” 

Hawking chuckled and waited 
expectantly, and after a long and 
very silent pause first one, then 
another joined him in laughter; but 
it had a rather hollow sound, or so 1 
thought. Larry agreed when we 
could talk about it later. 

So far as we can tell, we’ve just 
heard one of the top people in 
theoretical physics tell us that we 
don’t know anything and can’t 
know anything; that causality is a 
local phenomenon of purely tem- 
porary nature; that time travel is 
possible; that Cthulthu might 
emerge from a singularity, and in- 
deed is as probable as, say, H. P. 
Lovecraft. 

Hawking concluded by reminding 
us that Albert Einstein once said 
“God does not play dice with the 
universe.” 

“On the contrary,’’ Hawking 
said, “it appears that not only does 
God play dice, but also that he 
sometimes throws the dice where 
they cannot be seen!” 



★ * * 

Lovecraftian horror indeed. Our 
rational universe is crumbling. 
Western civilization assumes reason; 
that some things are impossible, 
that’s all, and we can know that; 
that werewolves don’t exist, and 
there never was, never could be, a 
god Poseidon, or an Oracle that 
spoke truly; that the universe is at 
least in principle discoverable by 
human reason, is knowable. 

That, says one of the men we be- 
lieve best understands this universe, 
is not true. It’s not very probable 
that Cthulthu will emerge from the 
primieval singularity created in the 
Big Bang, or that Poseidon will 
suddenly appear on Mount Olym- 
pus, but neither is impossible; and 
for that matter, this world we think 
we understand, which seems to 
obey rational laws we can discover, 
isn’t very probable either — isn’t, in 
fact, in the long run, any more 
probable than a world that includes 
Cthulthu, or the pudding that ate 
Chicago. 

★ * * 

Well, of course I don’t believe 
that; not in the sense that I’m going 
to alter my life to conform to a law- 
less and unpredictable universe. But 
I am now reduced to an act of faith: 
an irrational belief that the world 
and universe are, must be, lawful, 
and rational. 

This is not “faith in science” or 
believing in science; not any more. 

103 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 




It never was, actually; but Hawking 
has laid bare the hidden flaw. So 
long as science itself concluded that 
the universe was lawful, few of us 
were tempted to ask why this should 
be so, or to realize that this is the 
one question science can never 
answer. 

Now, though, science itself says 
the universe is not lawful. If you 
want a lawful universe, you’ve got 
to take a leap of faith; you’ve got to 
hold fast to an irrational belief. 
While you’re doing that, why not 
also believe there’s a higher purpose 
to it all? 

Is it harder to believe the uni- 
verse is lawful and purposeful than 
to believe it is lawful but without 
purpose? 

* * * 

In the Beginning, the Big Bang 
emitted Chaos; and the Chaos was 
without form, and void, for it was 
homogeneous and isotropic. And 
the Singularity moved upon the face 
of the Chaos and emitted light; and 
the Universe was no longer 
homogeneous, for the light was di- 
vided from the darkness. 

And there came forth firmaments 
and dry land and seas and stars and 
moons; and the worlds brought forth 
grass, the herb yielding seed, and 
the fruit trees yielding fruit after his 
kind, whose seed is in itself. 

It is quite literally true that if you 
can believe that, you can believe 
anything; more, you must believe 

104 



anything. To exclude anything you 
must make an act of faith. 

★ ★ * 

As we drove away from Pasade- 
na, Larry remarked that if we ever 
had proximity to a singularity, he 
could well imagine people praying 
to it. After all, their prayers proba- 
bly wouldn’t influence what came 
out of it — but they might, and cer- 
tainly nothing else would. I even 
had an idea for a filippant story to 
be entitled “The Oracle.’’ 

I don’t think I’ll write that story. 

If this new work of Hawking’s 
holds up — and if we’ve correctly in- 
terpreted what we heard — there are 
going to be some changes in the 
fundamentals of Western Civiliza- 
tion. 

Will philosophy once again be- 
come the “Queen of Sciences?’’ I 
don’t know; I suspect, though, that 
what we heard during our Lovecraft- 
ian afternoon will have a long 
reach. We either need some funda- 
mental new breakthroughs in 
theoretical physics — and I’ve heard 
no hint of what they may be — or 
we’ll have to start thinking about 
faith again. 

Meanwhile, for next month Larry 
Niven and I have collaborated to 
give you the “lost preface” to THE 
MOTE IN GOD’S EYE, and a 
double-length article on how we 
created the cultures and science in 
MOTE — a universe which is lawful. 

We’ve beem promised a spectacu- 
lar cover and illustrations, too. ★

Fighting Spacethings had been 
a relatively simple task- 
dealing with Mission Control 
was another matter entirely! 



ilELLO, MISSION CONTROL, Can 
you read me? Over. ...” 

Static snapped, crackled, popped 
in response. 

“ . This is Helbent Four, 
Mission Control. Come in. .” 
Helbent listened, then shut down 
the communications channel. Why 
listen to dead air? Why watch stat- 
ic? Life was touch enough without 
being ignored, snubbed, shown 



complete and utter indifference. 
Gone three hundred years just to be 
snubbed and ignored. He opened 
the communications channel briefly, 
boosting the gain to a shout. 

“Who needs it, creeps? Life’s too 
short!’ ’ 

What now? Orbit Earth and wait? 
Helbent searched his memory 
banks, checking, rechecking. He 
was programmed for every con- 
tingency but one, coming home. He 
had known exactly where to meet 
the Spacethings, exactly what to do 
when he got there. He had met 
them and done it, goal attained, 
purpose accomplished. Afterward, 
discovering himself the lone sur- 
vivor, he had searched his memory 
banks for a new plan, a new pur- 
pose. None appeared. 

True, his designers had estimated 
a ten to one overkill on both sides. 



107 



True, the estimates proved 
correct — at least as far as the Space- 
things were concerned. True, they 
had been 99.999998 percent accu- 
rate in estimating Earth losses, 
but — damn them — they could at 
least have programmed for the 
vague possibility of a Destroyer 
surviving. Probabilities and preic- 
tions were fine in their place — 
before the fact — but after the fact, 
the .000002 percent probability of 
his survival became a hundred- 
percent certainty. 

Helbent took up a parking orbit 
and circled Earth, thinking. 
Purposeless — actually, left only 
with his original purpose — he felt 
useless. No more Spacethings, no 
more purpose. He almost regretted 
having destroyed them. On the 150 
year trip out, his purpose — save 
mankind and destroy Space- 
things — never flagged. Only with 
success did he feel loss. 

He remembered approaching the 
Spacething armada, flanked by his 
comrades for a million kilometers 
on each side. He remembered the 
look of the Spacething craft, ini- 
tially a single unit a half million 
kilometers long, breaking up into 
sections and dispersing in front of 
him at close range. He remembered 
the momentary hesitation before the 
battle, each side waiting for the 
other’s opening blast. Helbent him- 
self had decided the day. He knew 
his goal. 

He had his purpose. He had come 
to fight. He would fight. He sighted 

108 



on the nearest Spacething and fired. 

After the battle — elapsed time 
2.478 nanoseconds — the anticlimax 
set in. Helbent, alone in space, 
wondered what to do. The Space- 
things were gone. His comrades of 
the long journey out were gone. 
Only one thing remained — Earth, 
mankind, his place of creation. He 
started back. 

* * * 

Helbent opened all communica- 
tion channels. 

“And what do I get when I get 
there? Not even a how do you do!' ’ 

“Hello?” 

Startled, Helbent snapped off the 
transmitter. Had he actually heard 
it? A word, a voice, a human be- 
ing? Cautiously, suspiciously, he 
went on the air. 

“Who is this?” 

“Who is thisT' 

“You first. This could be a 
Spacething trap.” 

“Pardon me?” 

“You heard me. Who are you?” 

“This is Houston Mission 
Control — mean, it would be Mis- 
sion Control if we had a mission to 
control. Actually, it’s just me. I 
saw your blip. It’s not supposed 
to be there.” 

“That just shows how much you 
guys know, doesn’t it?” 

“You speak English very well for 
a—” 

“For a what?” 

“Alien.” 



GALAXY 




“Alien,” scoffed Helbent. “You 
people wouldn’t know an alien if 
one blasted you. What did you ex- 
pect, Armenian? I was programmed 
by the NASA contingent. They 
speak English, I speak English. 
Never did get along with those 
Rusky-speaking ships. Always 
sounded like backwards English to 
me. Had to talk to them in binary. 
Damned impersonal. Now tell me 
what you want me to do. Mission 
Control. I’m back.” 

“Do?” 

“ ‘Do?’ ” mimicked Helbent, 
repeating the man’s own voice with 
precision, then dropping into his 
own — or, more accurately, that of 
his programmer, a surly man with 
whom Helbent never got along. 
“You sound like you’ve never 
heard the word before.” 

“I have, I mean, I haven’t, at 
least not from anything in space.” 
Helbent’s temper flared. “You 
call me a Spacething again, buster, 
and I’ll blast you. I’ll home in on 
that static-ridden carrier of yours 
with a ... a ... ’’ Helbent 
thought, visualizing the largest 
weapon in his largely depleted arse- 
nal. “ . neutrino bomb.’’ He 
had none aboard. 

Dead air, sn^, crackle, pop. 
Gutless, concluded Helbent. Typ- 
ical, gutless human behavior. One 
mention of a neutrino bomb and 
they head for the woods. He had 
always suspected humans were 
cowards. Why else send a robot to 
do a man’s job? 

HELBENT 



Helbent repositioned himself in 
synchronous orbit over Houston. 

“You down there, creep, speak 
up. No bombs, I guarantee.” 

The ground carrier flicked on and 
off briefly, long enough to blurt out 
its message. “What do you want?” 
“I told you what I want. I want 
to know what I’m supposed to do. I 
am thy servant, remember?” 

A quick on-off flick of the car- 
rier. “No.” 

“Listen, you chicken-headed 
stooge, will you quit snapping that 
damn transmitter in my ear and talk 
to me. And send up some visuals 
while you’re at it. I like to see who 
I’m talking to.” 

“Visuals?” 

“Little pictures, you know, tele- 
vision, that sort of thing.” 

“There’s no equipment for send- 
ing visuals, as you call them.” 

“I know damn well there’s 
equipment for sending visuals. Why 
would I have equipment for receiv- 
ing visuals if you didn’t have 
equipment for sending them? Riddle 
me that, wise guy. Now, get off the 
stick and turn on the little pic- 
tures.” 

“Who are you, anyway?” 
Momentarily, Helbent wished he 
still had at least one neutrino bomb 
on board. “I am going to say it 
once. I am going to say it clearly. 
You will listen with both ears and 
pay attention with your mind, if you 
have one. Got that?” 

“Yes.” 

“Good. I am Helbent Four. I am 

109 




reporting back to you clowns be- 
cause I can’t think of anything bet- 
ter to do with my time. If I could 
think of something better to do with 
my time, you may be ninty-nine 
point nine, nine, nine, nine, eight 
percent certain I would do it. Mis- 
sion accomplished. Got that? No 
more Spacethings. All gone. Boom. 
Got that? The next move — since I 
find trying to carry on an intelligent 
conversation with the subcretinous 
beings I now find inhabiting this 
planet totally frustrating and wish to 
restrain myself from doing some- 
thing I may later regret — is up to 
you. I will keep a listening channel 
open on this frequency, a somewhat 
low frequency, I might add. If you 
have anything sensible to say, con- 
tact me. Got that?” 

A pause ensued. Houston’s car- 
rier remained on the air. Finally, 
the man spoke. “What’s a Space- 
thing?” 

Helbent, infuriated, remembering 
the battle and his lost comrades, 
remained silent as long as he could, 
stifling his anger. When stifling 
proved worse than venting, he 
cranked up the gain to maximum 
and spoke. 

“THAT,” he began, mollified 
only by the thought that in three 
hundred years man's essential 
trait — ingratitude — had persisted, 
simultaneously recognizing that or- 
ganically based consciousness was 
subject to emotional caprice — unlike 
machines — and had to be allowed 
for, taking these things into consid- 
110 



eration and discarding each as un- 
persuasive, he concluded, “IS AN 
INSULT!” 

“Sorry,” piped Mission Control. 

* * -k 

Helbent waited, hoping the man 
would have enough sense to find 
someone who knew what he was 
doing. He ran the odds on finding 
such a person through the computer. 

Insufficient data. 

“What do you mean, insufficient 
data, you dumb beast?- Why don’t 
you use a little imagination?” 

Insufficient data. 

Helbent harumpfed, recognizing 
the harumpf as his way of letting 
off steam. He had known the com- 
puter for three hundred years. It had 
never, to his knowledge, shown the 
slightest inclination toward imagina- 
tion. It was and remained a dumb 
beast, a fellow machine, true, a 
brother under the skin, true, but 
dumb, its stupidity matched only by 
that of their mutual human design- 
ers who thought an analytical func- 
tion detached from the conscious 
function would give the ship more 
flexibility, allowing uninhibited im- 
agination to continue without analyt- 
ic censure — usually in the form of 
statistical probabilities — from the 
logic circuits. Only in combat did 
they function as one, allowing split 
nanosecond decisions. 

Helbent realized the irrationality 
of expecting the computer to sud- 
denly come up with an imagination. 
Its type of cold and logical critic 

GALAXY 




seldom had imagination. Helbent 
apologized. “Sony.” 

Insufficient data. 

“If you could baik or something, 
you’d be a better companion.” 
Helbent waited, one, two, three 
hours. Early evening approached 
and descended upon Houston. He 
decided to listen to the news. Three 
hundred years was a long time 
without news. He scanned the 
50,000 megahertz band, looking for 
a news broadcast. More dead air. 
He searched higher, then switched 
to lasercom. Nothing. He remem- 
bered Houston’s low frequency and 
searched the low end of the spec- 
trum, encountering commercial 
television broadcasts flanking one 
hundred megahertz. He adjusted the 
five thousand line scan of his own 
visuals to the five hundred-odd 
lines of the commercial transmis- 
sions, commenting, “That’s a giant 
step backwards if I ever saw one.” 
Flickering, someone named Wal- 
ter read the news. 

“ . and further, NASA reports 
the aliens, which call themselves 
Spacethings, have taken up a syn- 
chronous orbit over Hous- 
ton ” 

Spacethings? Over Houston? 
Quickly, Helbent did a spherical 
scan to a distance of a quarter of a 
million kilometers. No sign of any 
Spacethings. Still, it was good to 
know they were in the area. 

”... Again, NASA cautions 
against panic. The recently disman- 
tled Space Operations Headquarters 

HELBENT 



at Houston is being mantled — I 
mean, manned. Kennedy Space 
Center is readying a bird at this 
moment.” Walter, the news reader, 
turned to a man next to him at the 
desk. The camera pulled back to in- 
clude both men. “Wally, while 
we’re waiting for any late develop- 
ments, perhaps you can tell us the 
difference between the Saturn Five 
being readied at this moment and 
those used in the Apollo missions.” 

“Certainly, Walter.” 

” ‘Certainly, Walter,’ ” mim- 
icked Helbent, wondering what 
a Saturn Five was. He had a lot of 
catching up to do on technical mate- 
rial. 

“Hold it a second, Wally,” said 
Walter, breaking in. “Let me break 
in with a few more details about 
Brad Wilkes’ background. For those 
of you who joined us late. Brad 
Wilkes is the man who first con- 
tacted the alien craft.” 

“Thanks, Walter,” said Helbent, 
who had joined them late. 

“He is not by a long shot an or- 
dinary janitor. B.A., Cal. Tech., 
M.A., Ph.D., M.I.T. in systems 
engineering. Before Congress killed 
the space program entirely — and 
I’m sure there will be repercussions 
about that at the next election, Wal- 
ly-” 

“I’m sure there will be, too, 
Walter.” 

“Before that. Dr. Wilkes was 
Mission Control supervisor at Hous- 
ton.” 

“That explains his knowledge of 

111 




the equipment, doesn’t it, Walter.” 
“It certainly does, Wally. It says 
here — and this is a poignant note — 
that Dr. Wilkes would test the 
equipment daily, more to evoke 
memories than anything else. It was 
during one of these nostalgic sys- 
tems checks that Dr. Wilkes discov- 
ered the alien blip and conversed 
with it. He claims it learned perfect 
English almost instantaneously. Do 
you have any comment on that, 
Wally?” 

“I wouldn’t touch it with a ten 
foot pole, Walter.” 

“While we’re waiting, Eric 
(transmission garbled) has a few 
thoughts on the subject. Here’s his 
analysis. Eric?” 

The picture changed to a closeup 
of a distinguished looking man al- 
ready talking into the camera. Hel- 
bent was struck immediately by the 
intelligence in the man’s face. 

“Today, mankind encountered an 
alien race, an alien creature ...” 

A spacething? Helbent wondered. 
“ ... an intelligence so power- 
ful it learned human speech 
— idiomatically — during its first 
conversation. ...” 

Helbent, metaphorically, shiv- 
ered. He had never encountered an 
alien intelligence that powerful. 
Spacethings, according to the brief 
observation he had of them, could 
barely talk. Even after the 
warpstorm, disorienting him for 
several years, when he contacted 
the creatures on Wolff 25c, they 
had proved close to morons. He 

112 



hoped the powerful alien intelli- 
gence would keep its distance. 

”... For years,” continued the 
distinguished Eric, “Sci-Fi has giv- 
en us bug-eyed monsters and 
winged phantasmagorias. ...” 
Helbent searched his memory 
banks, looking for the meaning of 
phantasmagoria. 

“. For years, we laughed in 
Sci-Fi’s face. Today, we are not 
laughing. Today, we seek as it 
sought — alone, neglected those 
many years. We seek understand- 
ing, knowledge, brotherhood across 
the stars and a Saturn Five capable 
of delivering multi-warhead nu- 
clear weapons in space. Back to you, 
Walter.” 

To Helbent, the man made sense. 
Helbent, for one, would never laugh 
in the face of a winged phantas- 
magoria. 

The low frequency communica- 
tion channel from Houston came 
alive. Helbent shut off the conuner- 
cial channel — Walter, Wally and 
Eric. 

“Hello, creature. This is Hous- 
ton.” 

“And about time, too.” 

“Don’t get angry.” 

“Who’s angiy?” 

“You sounded, well, petulant.” 
Helbent searched his memory 
banks for the meaning of the 
word — petulant, p-e-t-u-1 — found it 
and answered. “>^o’s petulant?” 
“We mean you no ill will.” 
“Thank NASA for small favors.” 
“But we must clear up some dis- 

GAIAXY 




crepancies in our earlier conversa- 
tion. You can understand the need 
for that.” 

“On your side, sure.” 

“May we ask some questions?” 

Irritated, Helbent allowed as to 
how they could ask some questions. 
During construction and initial test- 
ing, neither Helbent nor any ship of 
the armada had been asked its per- 
mission to do anything. He had 
been told to do things. He had 
learned, early, that human beings 
gave orders, machines took them, 
human beings gave direction and 
purpose, robotships followed direc- 
tions and fulfilled purposes. Having 
his permission asked wrankled. He 
wanted orders. He wanted to know 
what to do. Still, the request, com- 
ing from a human being, amounted 
to an indirect sort of order. When 
the man failed to ask his question 
immediately, Helbent said, “Fire 
away.” 

“THEY’RE FIRING! ” shreaked 
Houston, abruptly leaving the air. 

“Who?” inquired Helbent. Too 
late. The carrier had vanished. 
“Hey, Houston. Who?” 

Helbent scanned in a half million 
kilometer sphere. Nothing. No 
Spacethings, no Phantasmagorias, at 
least not firing. Only Earth was 
fir — Earth? 

Something, evidently someone’s 
idea of a rocket, lumbered up from 
Earth. Helbent watched, fascinated. 
The thing looked like some kind of 
antique. Suddenly, Helbent realized 
its true purpose — a salute. Someone 

HELBENT 



dragged the antique from the Smith- 
sonian and launched it, a tribute to 
his valor. Everything else had been 
arranged to hoodwink him and let 
this moment of tribute shine alone 
like a single rose in the hand of a 
beautiful woman. 

Helbent felt pride, not only at re- 
surrecting the rose simile from some 
novel in his memory banks, but at 
this tribute — so singular, so appro- 
priate, so moving. He opened all 
communication channels to acknowl- 
edge the tribute. 

“Thank you, America. Thank 
you. Earth. Unaccustomed as I am 
to public speaking ...” Helbent 
noticed the antique make a mid- 
course burn. “ . I would 
nevertheless like to say a few 
words — but only a few — concerning 
the depths of emotion I feel at this 
tribute. After returning from the 
depths of space, I am deeply moved 
by the deep sentiment I detect be- 
hind this romantic and deeply 
felt — ” Helbent detected something 
else, the computer’s insistent mut- 
ter, interrupting his speech. “What 
is it, damn it? I’m speaking to the 
world, immortal words, and you 
keep butting in. What, for the love 
of NASA, is it?” 

Impact, twenty-one point two, 
nine, five seconds. 

“Pardon me?” 

Impact, nineteen point oh, oh, 
one seconds. 

Though Helbent hated to destroy 
such a classic of human ingenuity, 
the thing seemed to be off course. 

113 




Even if it carried only low-grade 
nuclear weapons, it could still cause 
damage, a dent or a crease. 
Momentarily, he merged sen- 
sibilities with the computer. Reluc- 
tantly, he sent out a molecular 
shock wave and watched the missile 
collapse, then explode. 

Helbent separated himself from 
the computer and returned to his 
speech. “As I was saying, ladies 
and gentlemen, deeply moved as I 
am by this — ” 

Impact, six point three-one . 

“Impact! \^at the hell are you 
jabbering about? I just destroyed the 
poor thing.” 

. seven seconds, concluded the 
implacable computer. 

Helbent searched space. Another 
antique — Russian by the markings 
(He recognized the CCCP his late 
comrades had carried) — lifted to- 
ward him. The sight of it moved 
him more than ever. The Ruskies 
saluting a machine created, de- 
veloped and built in America (ex- 
cept for a few Japanese electronic 
components here and there) — Ahh, 
that was tribute. 

But, unfortunately, the Ruskie 
bird too had veered. Evidently, the 
Russian museum piece was as unre- 
liable as the American. Helbent 
merged with the computer, pulsed a 
photon beam at the Russian vehicle 
and mentally saluted its quick de- 
mise. He disengaged himself from 
the computer. 

The Houston ground channel 
opened. Helbent was about to thank 

114 



them for their deeply felt tribute and 
apologize for having to destroy such 
venerable craft, when a voice inter- 
rupted, less hesitant, more authorita- 
tive, though spouting the same non- 
sensical questions as the previous 
timid voice. 

“Who are you?” 

Helbent, in his equivalent to a 
position of braced attention, re- 
sponded to the tone of authority in 
the voice, ignoring the question’s 
basic inanity. “SIR! Helbent Four 
of NASA Contingent, Earth Arma- 
da, reporting back, SIR!’ ’ 

“Pardon me?” 

Helbent unbraced. Wrong again. 
Another moron. Helbent prepared to 
switch off the channel and continue 
his speech to the world. 

The voice interrupted. “You said 
Earth Armada.” 

“I did indeed.” 

“And NASA.” 

“National Aeronautics and — ” 

“I know what it means. We are 
trying to ascertain — and it is of 
primary importance that we do 
ascertain — whether you are friend- 
ly-” 

“I’m trying to ‘ascertain’ the 
same thing.” 

“Good, then we have a common 
interest.” 

“I doubt it.” 

“May I ask you a few questions, 
Helbent Four — May I call you 
that?” 

“Helbent’s fine.” 

“Where do you come from, Hel- 
bent?” 



GALAXY 




“Earth.” 

A pause ensued. “When?” 
“Three hundred years ago.” 
“Sixteen hundred years ago.” 
“Sixteen eighty?” 

“There abouts.” 

“From what countiy?” 

Patience thinning, Helbent con- 
trolled himself, suspecting the inter- 
rogation could be some form of sub- 
tle system’s check. “The U.S. of 
A. That stands for — ” 

The man interrupted with a pa- 
tronizing, paternal tone. “In sixteen 
eighty, there was no United States, 
Helbent.” 

Helbent’s patience expired. 
“Now, listen, Houston, I know you 
engineering types are weak on his- 
tory, but / am not. I have my mem- 
ory banks — along with Gerber's 
Decline and Fall of the Carthage- 
nian Empire — Henry Iron Com- 
manger’s Complete History of the 
United States. Volume one deals 
with the Founding Fathers, 
Washington, Jefferson and our first 
President, Schwartz, recounting 
their heroic labors in fifteen 
twenty-one — fifteen twenty-one , 
Houston. You do know the names 
of the Founding Fathers, don't 
you?” 

“Schwartz doesn't ring a bell." 
“It should, the Harry S. Therman 
of his day, one of the truly great 
figures in human history. 1 shall 
read, for your edification and educa- 
tion, from Professor Commanger’s 
history. It will, I am sure, make 
more sense than what you’ve been 



blathering.” Helbent began reading 
volume one to Houston. 

Houston tried to interrupt. 

“What is it now, Houston?” 

“I think we’re having difficulty 
communicating.” 

Mentally, Helbent checked all his 
equipment. Everything seemed in- 
tact. “It’s all on your end, Hous- 
ton. Systems check shows no mal- 
function.” 

“That isn’t what I meant. You 
say you come from Earth.” 

“I do come from Earth.” 

“You say you come from the 
United States.” 

“A gen-u-wine native son.” 
“Then you’re human.” 

“Of course I’m not human. If I 
were human, I would have been 
back here with the rest of you lily- 
livered ingrates instead of a hundred 
and twenty light years out in space 
almost getting my ascent engine 
shot off. Now, I’m getting ex- 
tremely tired of answering these in- 
ane questions. Can we move on to 
something else? Something sensi- 
ble?’’ 

“Like what?” 

“Like what you want me to do.” 
“Hold on, Helbent.” 

Hold on. Hold on. Get to the 
crux of the matter and Houston says 
hold on. He was beginning to think 
the First Folio edition of Darwin’s 
Origin of the Genus was wrong. 
What goes up must come down. In 
three hundred years, humanity — at 
least that part of it represented by 
Houston — had evidently begun the 



HELBENT 



115 




long descent back to primordial 
slime. 

it -k it 

Helbent switched on the commer- 
cial frequency to kill time. Walter 
and Wally were still talking. Eric, 
whom Helbent wished would take 
over Houston ground-control, was 
unavailable. 

“Walter.” 

“Yes, Wally.” 

“With this new data — both the 
Soviet and American vehicles ut- 
terly destroyed and Houston saying 
the thing claims Earth — ” 

“Claims to be from Earth, Wal- 
ly. They aren’t exactly the same 
thing.” 

“Still, Walter, it’s a distinction 
without a difference. If the thing 
thinks it belongs here, for whatever 
reason, if our ICBM’s are to it as 
wanton flys to boys — ” 

“I think the phrase is ‘flys to 
wanton boys,’ Wally. Maybe Eric 
would know.” Walter pressed an 
earphone further into his ear. 
“Eric?” 

“I’m here, Walter. The phrase is 
from ...” 

Wally, anxious, reached over and 
grabbed Walter’s lapels, ,^haking the 
older man. 

“Listen to me, Walter. This is 
important.” 

”... Shakespeare,” concluded 
Eric. 

“I’m listening, Wally.” 

“Maybe, Walter, if they can do 
all that, maybe we should give up.” 

116 



Walter looked stunned. “Give 
up?” 

“It swatted aside our boys like 
wanton flys, Walter!” Wally shook 
Walter. “Like wanton flys!" 

“You’re getting hysterical, Wal- 
ly. Where’s that famous astronaut’s 
calm?” 

Wally released Walter, dropping 
his head to the table and supporting 
it with his forearm, sobbing audi- 
bly. "Gone! Gone! Everything’s 
gone!’ ’ 

Walter looked at the camera. 
“Let’s see what Eric (Transmission 
garbled) has to say about that. 
Eric?” 

At last, thought Helbent, sense. 

The distinguished man came on 
the screen. “Wally, I’m going to 
have to disagree with your analysis. 
The thing fired only in self-defence. 
True, it destroyed our best defenses. 
True, that demonstrates a technical 
capability far superior to our own. 
True, NASA reports the thing has a 
surly attitude. But, it continues to 
talk. It seems open to reasoned de- 
bate. My decision would be to con- 
tinue that debate, to learn from a 
superior culture. Properly handled, 
mankind might well make a quan- 
tum leap into the future. Back to 
you, Wdter.” 

Helbent switched off to think. 
Somewhere in Eric’s commentary, 
Helbent had picked up a thought. 
He wanted to ponder it. “Compu- 
ter, what is the probability that Walt- 
er and Wally — and especially 
Eric — were referring, not to Space- 

GALAXY 




things or winged Phantasmagoria, 
but me?” 

Ninty-nine point nine eight per- 
cent. 

“That high?” 

Affirmative. 

“That’s the first time I’ve ever 
heard you be that positive about 
anything.” 

The computer remained silent, re- 
sponsive only to questions or or- 
ders. 

‘‘What’s the probability this 
civilization has been degenerating 
for three hundred years?” 

Insufficient data — unempirical es- 
timate below point oh-oh-oh-one 
percent. 

Abruptly, an idea — intuitive, un- 
analyzed, yet convincing — forced its 
way into Helbent’s musing, exactly 
the kind of idea his designers lad 
hoped to stimulate by separating the 
squelching and critical faculty of the 
computer from Helbent’s sterling 
creative imagination. What if — 
“Conputer, what is the probability 
of finding a second planet in our 
Galaxy — no, strike that. In our 
universe — I might as well think 
big — a second planet with the same 
biological evolution as Earth’s, the 
same socio-cultural-linguistic evolu- 
tion, the same geophysical charac- 
teristics, but — this is important 
computer, so pay attention — an 
evolution on all levels three hundred 
years behind Earth prime, a 
dwarfed, stunted, pigmy Earth, 
historio-culturally speaking?” 

The computer responded im- 

HELBENT 



mediately, plopping out a decimal 
point followed by a string of zeros 
so long Helbent lost count. The 
sequence terminated with a “one to 
the minus”, another enormous 
figure. 

“That small, huh?” 

Affirmative. 

Helbent pondered. It made less 
sense than Wally and Walter. Either 
two Earths existed — accounting for 
the primitive state of present human 
technology, the jumbled and inaccu- 
rate version of their history, as well 
as the biological dysfunction he 
suspected in their brains — or — or 
what? 

“I need data, dammit, raw data.” 

He tried to reach the Library of 
Congress on the standard frequency. 
No response. He relocated over 
Washington and switched to high 
power optical observation, penetrat- 
ing the cloud layer, searching out 
the Library of Congress, peering in 
through a dirty window. 

“Books?” 

Helbent shuddered. With an in- 
formation retrieval system that 
clumsy, he would need the next 
three hundred years to find even 
basic facts. Imagination sapped, he 
abandoned the task. He sat in 
space, mind ruminating. When all 
else failed — when even imagination 
failed — he still had one alternative; 
brute logic. 

“Computer, read out every pos- 
sibility capable of explaining our 
current situation. Give me the prob- 
ability of each.” 

117 




The computer hesitated. In three 
hundred years, Helbent had never 
known the computer to hesitate. 
Malfunction? 

“Systems check.” 

All systems go. 

“Then why the hell are you sit- 
ting around here on your flip-flops? 
Flip or flop, but get on the stick. 
This is an order, computer. Prepare 
to read out! Reeeeead OUT!" 

The computer read out, a 
momentous rush of probabilities and 
possibilities, an inundation, a del- 
uge. Data of incredible complexity 
blew through Helbent’ s mind like a 
hurricane, bending biosynthetic 
synapses like palm trees. 

Slowly, Helbent adjusted. He be- 
gan looking for only high probabil- 
ity explanations. One rushed past. 
He snatched it from the torrent. He 
waited, enduring the storm, for 
another. 

None appeared. 

Abruptly, the data storm abated 
and died. 

“That’s it?” 

Readout complete. 

Helbent stared at the sole, high 
probability explanation in disbelief. 
So simple! So obvious! Had he 
been capable of wearing a cap, 
snatching it from his head, flinging 
it to the ground and stomping on it, 
he would have done so. “That 
damn warpstorm! If they told me 
once, they must have told me a 
million times to watch out for those 
damn things.” 

He degenerated into several 
118 



nanoseconds of cursing, some of it 
expressable only in binary. 

“All right, so a warpstorm dis- 
oriented me near Wolff 25c. So the 
only high probability explanation 
suggests I slipped through the gap 
left when the warpstorm excised a 
black hole, squeezing me out of one 
universe and into another. So I ar- 
rived back at this techno- 
logically — probably intellectually 
— retarded Earth. So what?” 

Helbent pondered. 

Houston broke in. “Mr. Helbent, 
this is Houston. What is your pur- 
pose here, your mission?” 

Helbent, now fully aware of 
mankind’s abysmal ignorance, 
answered flatly, cooperatively. 
“Save humanity.” 

“From what?” 

Though tempted to say itself, he 
answered, “Spacethings, but since 
they have been destroyed — ” Hel- 
bent broke off in mid- sentence, an 
idea forming in his mind. In 
his own universe, the Spacethings 
had been destroyed. As the sole 
veteran of the battle, he could testify 
to it. 

But here, in this universe — 

He looked in the direction of 
Sagittarius. Indeed, the binary home 
of the Spacethings existed in this 
universe, a faint speck with a white 
dwarf companion. If, as he now be- 
lieved, he had arrived at a different 
Earth in a different universe — a 
universe centuries out of joint with 
his own, an intellectually retrograde 
universe — confrontation with this 



GALAXY 




universe’s Spacethings lay in the fu- 
ture. 

“Mr. Helbent?” 

“What?” snapped Helbent, irri- 
tated at the interruption to his pon- 
derings. 

“What’s a Spacething?” 

Hypothesis confirmed. Helbent 
made up his mind. He felt a surge 
of new energy. No longer a point- 
less creation, he felt his sense of di- 
rection and purpose return. He 
looked toward Sagittarius and ex- 
perienced something like love. Out 
there, beyond the reach of Hous- 
ton’s paltry imagination, stood an 
entire universe, vast and beautiful, 
full of Spacethings waiting to be 
killed. 

He turned his attention to Hous- 
ton. No time to lose. Three hundred 
years, he had read somewhere, con- 
stituted only a blink of the cosmic 
eye. Spacethings would be there be- 
fore anyone knew it. “Listen, 
Houston, do you people have some 
kind of ground recording system? 
Wire recorders? Record players? 
Little men with clay tablets?” 

“Yes.” 

“O.K. Get your styli going on 
the tablets. I’m going to tell you 
about Spacethings.” 

Helbent told them, in grue- 
some detail, tales of demands and 
appeasements, battles and con- 
quests — finally, the awesome 2.478 
nanosecond clash of empires. Anti- 
climactic ally, he added a short ac- 
count of the long journey home, the 
warpstorm, his arrival. 

HELBENT 



When he finished, his emotions 
strained to the limit by the experi- 
ences he had forced himself to re- 
live, Houston failed to respond. 
“Houston?” 

“Wait five, Helbent. We’re 
thinking.” 

“Thinking! Thinking! Isn’t the 
picture clear enough? Do I have to 
spell it out for you? You, mankind, 
Earth — all are in mortal danger. 
You must, immediately, divert ev- 
ery resource into combating this 
imminent and immanent menace. 
Do you understand that?” 

Houston took the entire five min- 
utes. “We have reached our deci- 
sion.” 

“Thank NASA.” 

“We intend to fight.” 

Helbent heaved a sigh of relief. 
“Though initially we wished to 
pursue the path of reason, our 
President — consulting directly with 
world leaders and advised by the 
world’s most distinguished 
scientists — has decided to resist.” 
Helbent beamed with pride and 
satisfaction. 

“Frankly, your tale of interstellar 
empires and conquests, warpstorms 
and final battles — interesting and 
ingenious a fabrication as it is — ” 
“Fabrication!” 

“ — won’t hold water.” 

“Won’t hold — Now, wait just a 
minute, Houston — ” 

“You wait just a minute. Our top 
scientists assure us such a transfer 
between universes, even assuming 
other universes exist — cannot occur. 

119 




Your story is a charade, a ruse, a 
trick to gain our confidence before 
you — ” 

“A chziade! A ruse!" 

“You have five minutes to break 
orbit and clear out of our solar sys- 
tem. If you refuse, those two 
missiles — missiles, I might add, that 
our experts tell us you were lucky 
enough to destroy only because they 
came at you one at a time — wilt 
prove only a sample of our fateful 
lighting, our swift sword. Anything 
and everything capable of doing 
damage — from multi-warhead nu- 
clear weapons to .22 bullets — will be 
used. We will fight you on the 
beaches, in the field and in the 
town. We will fight you in the 
cities, if we have to, underground. 

Helbent, who had never cared 
much for verse, tried to interrupt. 

Houston continued. “The men of 
Earth — of mine own land — will 
fight you o’er the planet, for every 
grain of sand.’’ 

“That won’t be necessary, Hous- 
ton.” 

“You have,” delclared Houston, 
“five minutes.” 

Houston’s carrier left the air. 

■k -k * 

Helbent spent the five minutes 
thinking, mulling over possibilities 
and probabilities. He considered 
breaking orbit and following orders. 
The orders, after all, had come 
from human beings. Still, though he 
admired the fighting spirit behind 
the orders, he knew beyond a 

120 



shadow of a doubt the folly of car- 
rying them out. If he broke orbit, 
he would abandon mankind, at least 
this mankind in this universe. They 
would be left to molder in their re- 
tarded culture until this universe’s 
Spacethings came to crush them un- 
der an iron tentacle. 

At the end of five minutes, what 
looked to Helbent like a miniature 
armada lifted off from Earth, mis- 
siles firing from silos across the 
United States, submarines across the 
seas and gantries across the Soviet 
Union. Gradually, they approached, 
converging on him. Helbent turned 
the job of tracking and destroying 
the creeping missiles over to the 
computer, leaving his own mind 
free to think. 

He took the problem step by step, 
logically. These creatures — the idea 
of their profaning the name of hu- 
man annoyed him — seemed bound 
and determined to repel him. That 
they had no means to do so, that 
their technological arsenal had taken 
only one short step beyond the 
shaq) stick, that their capacity to go 
further might be doubted by any 
reasonable mind, never occured to 
them. (Missiles and warheads 
exploded harmlessly around him.) 

Still, he found himself unable to 
break orbit and abandon the fools to 
their folly. Besides, the more he 
thought about it (a fifty kiloton 
warhead detonated nearby, jostling 
the ship but otherwise leaving it un- 
damaged), the more he realized that 
breaking orbit would be to simul- 

GALAXY 




taneously break his prime directive. 

A plan, he needed one. He had to 
convince them of the danger ahead. 
He had to convince them to act 
immediately, to prepare, technolog- 
ically and psychologically, for the 
inevitable Spacething invasion. 
Something Eric had said came back 
to him: “ . Properly handled, 
mankind might well make a quan- 
tum leap into the future.” 

It made sense, the only sense 
Helbent had heard recently. Yet the 
sense it made chilled him. It went 
against everything ingrained in his 
memory banks, against every direc- 
tive but the prime directive. To ac- 
complish it, he would have to do 
things unheard of, undreamt of, un- 
planned for by his designers. He 
would have to reverse every fiber of 
his soldier’s psychology, give up 
the keystone of his pride, the core 
of his identity — he would have to 
return to Earth not victor but van- 
quished. 

Still, quantum leaps were quan- 
tum leaps. 

Helbent picked his target and fed 
in the coordinants. ‘‘Prepare to 
break orbit. Prepare for entry and 
touchdown.” 

For a second time in three 
hundred years, the computer hesi- 
tated. For the first time in three 
hundred years, it asked a question. 
Are you malfunctioning? 

‘‘Listen, you insubordinate piece 
of impure silicon, do as I say. I am 
not malfunctioning. And I want 
those coordinants hit exactly — on the 

HELBENT 



button — right on top of the Capital 
rotunda. Got it?” 

The computer had it. They broke 
orbit and started down. Though 
built in space and never designed to 
enter an atmosphere, a quick proba- 
bility check indicated most of the 
equipment — armaments, power sys- 
tems, basic ship’s library — would 
make it to the surface with little 
damage. Only the control center — 
Helbent and most of the 
computer — would fuse from the 
heat. On impact, the ship would 
split like a coconut. From the 
wreckage — from his corpse — 
mankind would take away its quan- 
tum technological leap. Perhaps, 
during three hundred years, they 
could even build better ships. Hel- 
bent wished he could meet them. 
His duty demanded otherwise. From 
his bones, crucified atop capital 
hill, mankind would take salvation. 

Helbent opened all communica- 
tions channels to Earth, shouting 
into them. 

“Whaaa-whooo, you lily-livered, 
sap-sucking gophers! It's me, the 
terrible Spacething! I’m a mean son 
of a bitch and I'm coming to get 
you! You better get your asses in 
gear because I ain’t alone! There’s 
a million more out there where I 
come from and in three hundred 
years we’re gonna crack this planet 
like a peanut! Whaaa-whooo, you 
lily-livered ” 

The outer hull began to glow, 
visible in the night sky over 
Earth. ★

In the may, 1975 issue of his ex- 
cellent magazine, KHATRU (1339 
Weldon Av., Baltimore, MD 
21211. $1.25 per issue.), Jeff Smith 
discusses a constant, nagging 
headache in the brain of the science 
fiction body electric. 

Briefly, it comes down to this: 
Howcum the science fiction readers 
out there — you — don’t buy much of 
the “best” and “quality” s-f that’s 
being published? 

Why do you, when push comes 
to shove and, the hand reaches for 
the book or magazine on the rack, 
and the mind makes The Decision, 
howcum you buy mostly “bad” 
science fiction? Hah? You a bunch 



of unintelligent, ignorant, non-think 
clods? Why aren’t you willing to 
spend your money on the “quality” 
that Robert Silverberg, for instance, 
likes to present in his new an- 
thologies and collections? 

You don’t buy enough of Bob’s 
choices, because his publishers are 
not coming back for much more, 
according to reports. So discouraged 
and pissed-off is Bob, as a matter 
of fact, that he has said out loud in 
front of large s-f convention audi- 
ences, that he is quitting science fic- 
tion. 

Well, maybe not complete- 
ly. .but mostly. 

We can only smile sadly and say 



122 



so-long. Bob. It was nice reading 
you. 

Jeff Smith thinks part of the prob- 
lem is in the image science fiction 
has which lingers on from the ‘de- 
plorable’ pulp days when the covers 
of the magazines were blatantly 
action-sex-danger oriented: the clas- 
sic situation showing a bug-eyed 
monster clutching a fair white 
Earth girl in its tentacles/claws/ 
pseudopods/whathave you while an 
earnest, heroic Earthman with blast- 
er blasting, rescues her. 

And, of course, the stories inside 
were written to match — the lowest, 
most shallow fiction, with 
cardboard characters and see- 
through plots abounding . Cliche 
piled upon cliche. Stereotypes run- 
ning rampant on fields of colorful 
trite phrases and hackneyed situa- 
tions. 

The best opinion then of pulp s-f 
was: food for thought, maybe, but 
writing fit only for kids and a few 
thousand retarded or obsessed 
adults. (Buy the magazine, slip it 
under your sweater if the clerk 
wouldn’t put it in a bag, slink home 
to read the awful stuff . Reading 
science fiction was only one small 
step above masturbation; it would 
rot the mind almost as fast.) 

Jeff thinks that if only enough 
mature, intelligent readers were 
aware of the New science fiction, 
the really Good Stuff being written 
and published, and would try it 
(you’ll like it) then all would be 
well and science fiction would 



flourish with its appropriate, edu- 
cated, thinkingman readership. 

Jeff thinks too much junk science 
fiction is being published, and that 
when the quality-oriented reader 
reaches (blindly, unguided) for to 
try some of that s-f stuff, he will 
like as not grab a Poul Anderson 
book, or a Clifford Simak book or 
something adequate and faintly 
juvenile and non-quality like 
that . and will judge all s-f by 
that sample, and thereafter stay 
away. Ahhh, wishes Jeff, if only 
those hypothetical quality readers — 
that vast, perceptive audience out 
there — could reach for a Delany 
book or a Russ book or a LeGuin 
book . THEN they’d be con- 
verts. 

So I guess Jeff would secretly 
like to ban all junk s-f from the 
marketplace for, say, a year, while 
that keen-minded audience ate up 
the good stuff (junk reading not be- 
ing available). Like a nutritionist 
deploring all the hamburger heavens 
and Twinkles on the shelves. 

But in a free marketplace there’s 
all that junk — and Jeff Smith 
weeps. Many weep. 

I laugh. 

I know why all that “junk” is on 
the stands and why the quality- 
hunting readers stay away from sci- 
ence fiction. And it isn’t because s-f 
has a bad image lingering from the 
pulp days. 

It is because readers know what 
they want. They have excellent, 
sensitive antennae which sense the 



123 




type of fiction in a book, and they 
have long memories. They’ve sam- 
pled enough to know, usually, who 
writes what and which company 
publishes what. They’ve learned the 
code, the subtle signals and words 
which betray (or flag) the “good” 
stuff from the “junk”. 

They buy mostly “junk”. 

YOU buy mostly “junk”. 

But you don’t think it’s junk. So 
whose value-system are we to use? 

Science fiction can’t use the 
“pulp-image” excuse anymore, to 
explain its lack of broad popularity 
and poor sales. For several years 
now the colleges and universities 
have been unfused with an aware- 
ness of “quality” science fiction. 
Hundreds of courses and classes on 
science fiction are taught each year. 
Papers are written on it, books pub- 
lished on how to teach it. The 
teachers and professors have found 
another small vein of literary- 
popular-culture to mine and use. 
Science fiction has become property 
now, a territory, in academia, and 
as more and more teachers and pro- 
fessors stake out their acres and 
build their fences, s-f will become 
another cemetary, with hundreds of 
men and women desperately rooting 
in the ground for their livelihood. 
Still — once a group of people are 
dependent on a literary field for 
their income and status, they’ll 
make it important and Significant. 
Science fiction is now Respectable. 

Of course, as 1 noted in another 
column, writers sometimes tend to 

124 



write for the approval of the profes- 
sors . and the professors, sensing 
this catering, reward those writers 
with much attention and praise. It’s 
a natural phenomenon. But in my 
view the headache comes down to a 
basic confusion of what should be 
with what is . 

Many s-f writers, editors and fans 
think the great bulk of the s-f read- 
ership (the hard-core couple 
hundred thousand, the fringe mil- 
lion, and the once-a-year two-three 
million readers) should want to read 
and buy “quality” s-f. 

The question shifts to what is true 
quality s-f. 

Sturgeon’s Law holds that 90% 
of all fiction is trash, junk, un- 
worthy. The “quality” proponents 
assume that their stories and novels 
represent the 10% that is worthy. 

But I would say that 90% of their 
Literary s-f is also crap. 10% is re- 
ally well written . and 10% of 
the “junk” s-f is also really well 
done. 

The Serious Writers in our field 
cannot stomach writing for readers. 
They consider plot and action and 
happy ending to be unrealistic, pan- 
dering, and unworthy of their talent 
and Image. They consider plotless, 
dull, pessimistic stories truly Liter- 
ary .. quality. 

And they moan and cry piteously 
to the sky when the people who 
vote with the dollars keep electing 
the hated “junky” entertaining 
work to higher office. 

Fiction, damn it, is story-telling. 

GALAXY 




And good story-telling is entertain- 
ing. And entertainment is the prim- 
ary duty/goal of the fiction writer. 
Even pretentious science fiction 
writers. 

A quote by Tom Wolfe front his 
long essay, “The Painted Word” is 
appropriate here: 

‘First you do everything pos- 
sible to make sure your world 
is antibourgeois, that it defies 
bourgeois tastes, that it mys- 
tifies the mob, the public, that 
it outdistances the insensible 
middle-class multitudes by 
light years of sublety and 
intellect — and then, having 
succeeded admirably, you ask 
with a sense of See-what-1- 
meanl outrage: look, they 
don’t even buy our products! 
(Usually referred to as “qual- 
ity art.”)’ 

I wonder how many science fic- 
tion writers ever ask themselves as 
they write, “How can I structure 
this scene so that the dynamics of it 
will catch and keep the reader? 
How can 1 “play” this dialog to be 
honest and captivating and informa- 
tive? How can I give the reader this 
necessary background without les- 
sening my grip on his throat? How 
can I intensify this suspense? How 
can I make this character more life- 
like and thus make his situation 
more believable, and the story more 
spell-binding?” 

From what I read every day — 
damn few.

sends me all their pocketbook re- 
leases, every month. Not just their 
s-f. I appreciate that. I get to see 
and compare the writing levels of 
various genres . and I’m forced 
to admit that the professionalism of 
the mystery-detective writers is 
much higher than that of our sci- 
ence fiction writers. 

For instance, MCQUAID by 
Shepard Rifkin (Berkley Z2841, 
$1.25). The writing is sharp, clean 
and convincing. Rifkin has talent 
and he uses his talent and skills to 
convince the reader that what he is 
reading is real. 

The reader knows he’s reading a 
story but he suspends his knowledge 
and “believes” in the world and the 
people of the author. WHY? Be- 
cause in this case he wants to read 
about murder and sex and crime and 
catching the killer after a good, 
challenging struggle. And he wants 
the people and the action and the 
background in the story to be as 
true-to-life as possible, to be as 
convincing as possible. 

He does not want the author to 
dance around shouting “Look at 
me!” and he doesn’t want to be 



125 





bored or lectured or made to feel 
dumb. 

I think that 90% of the “quality” 
science fiction published is guilty of 
some or all of those writing sins. 

The marvelous thing about 
MCQUAID is that Rifkin sneaks in 
a great deal of philosophy, a great 
deal of interesting and thought- 
provoking information, a lot of per- 
ceptive opinion and observation of 
people and the world, and he does 
it so well that the story would be a 
poor and anemic thing without it, so 
well that the reader relishes it, 
wants more, reads on as much for 
the content as for the action and sex 
and violence and suspense. 

That’s professionalism and talent 
and skill of a very high level. And 
if most of our talented science fic- 
tion writers could match it, could 
even approach it, could (or would) 
TRY for it — I’d be a very happy 
critic. 

A few s-f writers do follow the 
Reader-First ethic. A very good cur- 
rent example of that is THE MOTE 
IN GOD’S EYE by Larry Niven 
and Jerry Pournelle. Another is 
HIERO’S JOURNEY by Sterling E. 
Lanier. And 1, WEAPON by 
Charles Runyon is good. (It is in- 
teresting to note that Runyon also 
writes in the mystery-detective 
genre.) 

So my message to you readers — 
you who pay the freight — is do not 
be ashamed of reading entertaining 
“junk” science fiction. Don’t be 
status-shamed into buying the latest 

126 



unending, variation-on-a-theme by 
Samuel Delany because some Critic 
says it is Significant and a work of 
Art. DHALGREN is interesting for 
a hundred pages. After that it is a 
wordy bore. 

So let’s look for and reward the 
best damn “junk” science fiction 
we can find. If we do we’ll end 
with something worthwhile — and a 
hell of a lot more satisfied readers 
and a lot more happy, better paid 
writers. 

We might even end up with some 
hacks as good as a few of the old- 
timers like Shakespeare (a commer- 
cial playwright in his time), Dick- 
ens, A. Conan Doyle, Jules Verne, 
Balzac. .and many others 
who wrote superbly to please the 
reader, to entertain, and who were 
not at all self-consciously Artists or 
self-consciously concerned with Lit- 
erature. 

Literature is what lasts . and 
that’s what people continue to pay 
their money to read, year after year 
after year. Those are the cold equa- 
tions of writing.

PAT MURPHY 

NO MOTHER NEAR 

Listen to the hummm. 

128 



On a moonless night, on a star- 
less night, she floated in the sea. 
The water was still and warm. She 
floated peacefully, moored by just a 
few lines. Nothing to do, nothing 
that had to be done. 

She turned her head to tell Frank 
how happy she was; her head turned 
slowly, but something was wrong. 
Frank wasn’t beside her. There was 
Just more darkness. Warm darkness 
that pressed against her eyelids and 
tried to get into her mind. She was 
alone in the dark. And it wasn’t re- 
ally quiet; she could hear a hum, a 
steady hum. It frightened her, made 
her heart beat faster, no one would 
hear her scream, no one was near, 
no one was here. She lashed out 
with a fist but it moved slowly and 
weakly and there was nothing to 
hit, no one to fight, no one at all. 

* * * 

She woke. She lay curled on the 
bed, heart pounding. She opened 
her eyes to her apartment bedroom, 
lit with the thin, tired light of early 
dawn. She felt as insubstantial as 
the light, wraithlike and easily 
blown away. The light washed the 
colors out — her bedroom was a fine 
line-drawing of dimly recognizable 
furniture. She listened to the sounds 
of the freeway in the distance to 
reassure herself of her own being. 

A dream again, just a dream. 
Was she passing though that stage 
in life when lonely women dream 
strange and lonely dreams and keep 
cats for company? It had been ten 



years since Frank, or anyone else^ 
had shared her bed, yet she’d 
caught herself listening in the night 
for the sound of a heartbeat not her 
own. She’d never dreamed much at 
all — as a child she had, but as an 
adult there was Frank, then when 
the marriage ended, there was her 
work. She taught and worked with a 
steady passion, little time was left 
for anything else. She’d never 
floated in the sea at night; Frank 
was gone, long gone. 

She shook her head and got up 
quickly. With her clothes, she don- 
ned her person: Dr. Alice Woods, a 
researcher as sensible as grey hair 
and grey skirts. She brushed her 
hair and leaned closer to the mirror 
to inspect the circles under her 
eyes. Two many nights of un- 
finished dreams. 

The dreams had started a few 
months back. They weren’t all the 
same, but they were all similar; 
lonely and threatening. She frowned 
and rubbed her eyes to rub out any 
trailing wisps of the dream. 

She arrived at the university too 
early — no lectures to give today; the 
mail hadn’t arrived yet; the night 
cleaning crew had gone and the day 
people hadn’t arrived. 

She sat in the coffee room, drink- 
ing hot tea, reading the front page of 
the morning paper. In the lower 
right of the page was her picture; 
she was standing at a podium. 
While three middle-aged women 
carrying signs proclaiming 
“Mothers for Motherhood’’ waved 



129 




their fists at her from the audience. 
The picture was captioned: “How 
does it feel to be the mother of the 
Plastic Mother? Story, page 6.” 

She didn’t turn to page 6. She 
didn’t feel up to the tales of her 
own humanity, inhumanity, or 
sub-humanity that were sure to be 
there. Besides, she could write the 
story by herself. “Dr. Alice 
Woods . married and divorced 

. Ph.D. at Harvard . Re- 
search in fetal development ... the 
Plastic Mother is a common term 
for the artificial womb that Dr. 
Woods and her research team de- 
veloped . This technique allows 
a fertilized egg to be implanted in a 
plastic container and raised through 
its full development . recent 
work involving human eggs has 
generated controversy ... A new 
organization called Mothers for 
Motherhood. ...” 

Alice sighed and rested her head 
on her hand. Of course there would 
be a few interviews with members 
of the M.F.M. as well. “ ‘Raising 
a child in a cold metal box,' said 
one woman, ‘is no substitute for a 
mother. I have three kids — had ev- 
ery one myself — and . .’ ” 

Three kids — ^give that woman the 
medal of honor. Betty Big-Breeder. 
Pops them out just like a toaster. 

Alice shook her head, realizing 
she was getting upset with a product 
of her own imagination. Nothing 
worth wasting her energy on — just a 
few empty-headed housewives 
mouthing the same opinions. At 

130 



least the newspapers showed some 
variety in the way they viewed her: 
she was an unnatural monster, a 
flaming feminist, or else God’s gift 
to the scientific world and 
humanity — depending on the paper 
and the editor’s mood. Alice 
glanced at the picture again — this 
paper was of the unnatural monster 
variety. She tossed it onto a chair 
and glanced at her watch; not quite 
enough time for a nap before woik. 

Picking up her cup, Alice stood 
and headed for her lab. All the hall 
was quiet — no typing noises, no one 
rattling glassware or running the 
ditto machine, no talking, no walk- 
ing, no flushing toilets. Her ears 
hummed with the lack of sound; 
maybe it was just the blood rushing 
through her head. Everything was 
quiet except for the hum. 

She shook her head, wide eyed. 
Another hangover from the night. 
All night the world had been quiet, 
too quiet. She’d had to strain her 
ears to hear the grumbling of the 
water pipes or the creaking of the 
building. 

The door to the lab was open. 
The lights on. She could hear the 
charts of embryo heartbeat and 
movement humming, and the sound 
of rustling papers in the comer. 

“Hello! Anyone here?” 

“Morning, Alice.” Cindy Bell, 
one of the two graduate students 
working on the project, looked out 
from around the comer behind the 
second row of tanks. “What are 
you doing here so early?” 



GALAXY 




“I’ve got a crazy woodpecker 
that lives by my window. Every 
morning at about five he decides 
that my house is an affront to his 
persona] sense of aesthetics, so he 
works on tearing it down singlehand- 
edly. Sliver by sliver.” Cindy 
laughed. “It’s hopeless to sleep af- 
ter five; I might as well be here.’’ 
“Well, we’ll have matching cir- 
cles under our eyes. Have you 
started checking the tanks yet?” 
“I’m almost done.” 

“Good. How’s number twelve? 
The heartbeat showed some ir- 
regularities yesterday.” 

Alice listened quietly to Cindy’s 
explanation — the heartbeat had been 
fine all night. 

“And Alice, did you see the 
paper this morning?” Cindy’s ques- 
tion cut through the layer of drowsy 
inattention. Alice nodded. 

“You made the first page.” 

Alice nodded again — when she 
spoke, her own voice startled her by 
coming out thick and dream-heavy. 
“I know. There are times when I 
feel like a nineteenth century 
anatomist — robbing graves in pur- 
suit of knowledge while the mob 
howls for my blood, calling me 
butcher, grave robber, ghoul.” 
Cindy looked serious for a mo- 
ment, the image of a young scientist 
in her white lab coat, but then she 
laughed. “Well we’ll all be ghouls 
together then. Think I’ll just keep 
on counting the bodies.” She turned 
back to the tanks. 

Walking through the lab to her 



office, Alice remembered when she 
could grin and say “It’ll all be 
okay. It’ll all come up roses.” 
Long, long ago. In pre-diluvian 
times. Now she was scarred by the 
battles for grant- money, drained by 
the fight to keep ahead. She set her 
coffee cup in the center of her func- 
tional green blotter, sat down in her 
functional green swivel chair. Then 
she grinned at her own thoughts. 
Bitter-old-woman thoughts. She was 
just a product of her environment: 
green blotter, green chair, bile- 
green mind. 

Taking one last sip of tea, she 
flipped through the IN pile in the 
comer of her desk. Reports to read, 
charts to measure and record — she 
frowned when she hit a special 
MEMO midway down the pile. She 
pulled it out: speqal memo: pro- 
ject JUSTIFICATION. 

“What?!” She startled herself by 
saying the word out loud. She 
skimmed the memo. “To Dr. A. 
Wood; From Division Head Jason 
Daven.” It beat around the bush in 
the best university bureaucratic fash- 
ion: greetings, hedging, one or two 
lines of evasion, then the meat — ” 
due to publicity and controversy 
arising from the project, the project 
goals and justification will come up 
for general discussion and review at 
the next board meeting, in one 
month ...” 

Alice grabbed the phone. “Da- 
ven’s office? Dr. Woods call- 
ing . He’d damn well better 
speak to me.” Dear, dear, and my 



NO AAOTHER NEAR 



131 




heavens. Now she’d startled the 
poor little secretary. 

“Dr. Daven will speak with you 
now.” 

“Hello?” 

“Alright, Jake, what’s this crap 
about a special memo?” 

“Now, Alice, have you read it? I 
thought that it was clear ...” 

“Clear! Sure it’s clear. I justified 
this project right, left, upside down, 
sideways, inside out and five ways 
from the middle last year. It was 
considered and reconsidered then, 
when it was taken through the board 
review.” 

“Well, there’s been a lot of pub- 
lic opinion raised against the project 
since then and I thought ...” 

“Public opinion! What does that 
have to do with anything?” 

“Now, Alice, maybe we should 
talk this over when you’ve cooled 
off some. I don’t like to see anyone 
upset ...” 

“Then don’t send out absurd 
memos.” 

”... but after all, Alice, it’s 
just a reconsideration. Now why 
don’t you call me back when 
you’ve cooled off a little.” 

Dial tone. 

Alice hung up the receiver and 
fumed. That pompous, over-stuffed, 
over-paid, sub-human, moldy- 
minded . 

“Whew! Smells of brimstone in 
here. You look like you’re design- 
ing some unspeakable torture in the 
name of science’’ Russell Scott 
lounged in her doorway, somehow 

132 



making his lanky frame fit in the 
space. 

“No. In the name of revenge.” 

“Oh? Any poor fool I know? Or 
maybe I should say knew.” 

“Our beloved Division Head, 
Jake the Snake.” Alice glowered. 
“Reconsideration. I don’t have time 
to write progress reports and push 
papers now.” 

“Don’t worry, it’ll all blow over. 
Reconsideration,” he mused, “just 
the thing to get one’s adrenalin 
flowing in the morning.’’ Russ 
grinned at her then sauntered into 
the lab. 

Ah, youth. Alice sipped her cold 
tea and made a face. Beset by 
enemies — the M.F.M. outside the 
walls, Jake Daven inside. Project 
justification, paper work, progress 
report — a waste of her time. Russ 
was right — if would all blow over. 
But her time and energy wasn’t so 
abundant that she could squander it 
on this. 

She pulled out a pad of paper and 
a copy of the original project jus- 
tification. This type of bureau- 
cratese was automatic now; facts, fig- 
ures, impressive graphs, justifica- 
tion and future value for mankind 
all tied up in a neat package. She 
set to work. 

Long after lunchtime, Alice put 
down the pen and stretched. First 
draft done. She stood and wandered 
into the lab. Cindy and Russ were 
gone on an afternoon coffee break, 
but the lab hummed on alone. 

She moved to check tank 3. Their 



GALAXY 




oldest fetus was here — 2 months. 
She checked heartbeat and nutrient 
flow, both fine. The charts were 
running and humming and .the tank 
was in perfect operating condition. 

One newspaper report had de- 
scribed the tank as a “washing 
machine gone mad with dials and 
switches and charts ...” The 
tank was about the same size as a 
washing machine, and it had the 
same cool white finish on the out- 
side, so maybe that was an accurate 
description. She was so close to the 
project that it was hard to see them 
as anything but — tanks. Artificial 
wombs. 

Alice put her hand on the smooth 
metal side and felt the vibration of 
the chart’s hum, the warmth of the 
nutrient flow, maybe the ticking of 
a tiny heart. It was dark inside the 
tank where the plastic womb lay. 
She knew — a warm darkness that 
pressed close and tried to creep in 
where it wasn’t wanted. So quiet. 
No sight ... no sound save the 
hum of the chart and the wash of 
the nutrient solution around the em- 
bryo and through her veins. A 
throbbing silence. Warm rest and 
peace with a hum in the 
background. Floating in the dark 
with nothing to do . 

She snapped awake. Falling into 
daydreams on a sunny day — she 
needed more sleep. Suddenly she 
felt tired, worn to the bone. Maybe 
coming in the day after the incident 
in lecture had been a mistake. But 
someone had to push the papers, 

NO MOTHER NEAR 



write progress reports in a language 
Jake Daven could understand. 
Someone had to protect the project 
and fight the battles with enemies 
inside and outside the university. 
Alice sighed and pushed herself 
away from the tank. To the coffee 
room for a very late lunch. 

She walked silently down the 
hall, her old bones stiff, her old 
mind stiff. The students in the hall 
smiled and she nodded in return. It 
was only the reconsideration that 
made her feel so tired and old. 

Once, an enteqjrising young re- 
porter had looked a little too care- 
fully into Dr. Wood’s background 
in preparation for an interview. He 
asked her: “Does the fact that you 
once lost a child at birth have any- 
thing to do with your view of the 
need for fetal research and an artifi- 
cial womb?” She had looked at him 
so hard and long that he looked as 
if he might welcome an artificial 
womb to swallow him up and put 
him out of sight. The death of that 
child had broken her marriage. 
Frank had sympathized for a while, 
but he couldn’t break through the 
memories of a child that had never 
lived. Instead of fighting the 
memories, she’d fought Frank. She 
wrapped herself in the ghost of a 
child that had never lived long 
enough to die. So the marriage 
died. 

And she still remembered the 
cold feeling of an empty body, 
empty arms, no child, a cold loss 
that invaded her heart and froze her 

133 




from the inside out. 

She wasn’t sure what she’d fi- 
nally replied to the over-eager 
young reporter. Maybe something 
simple like “no.” Luckily, the pa- 
pers didn’t want in-depth interviews 
of her anymore — they just wanted 
interviews long enough to confirm 
their image of her. It eliminated a 
number of embarrassing questions. 

It was a worthwhile project. Fetal 
processes could best be studied in 
the controlled environment of an ar- 
tificial womb. She wasn’t a ghoul 
or a grave robber. All eggs and 
sperm were donated by people who 
believed in the project. Her own 
eggs, Cindy’s eggs, Russ’s sperm; 
students from her classes and old 
friends and colleagues had donated. 
She wasn’t a ghoul; no one had the 
right to complain. 

She turned wearily into the coffee 
room and poured herself a cup of 
coffee. Living on coffee and paper- 
work, she thought. Russ and Cindy 
were at a table; they made room for 
her. 

“Hey, you really look beat.” 

Alice twisted her mouth into what 
could pass for a smile. “Restating 
the obvious always exhausts me.” 
Surrounded by the young, she al- 
ways look beat, she thought. Al- 
most all the people in the coffee 
room were many years her juniors. 
Students, grad students, and bright 
young professors — so many of her 
contemporaries were gone. 

‘‘That lecture yesterday must 
have really taken it out of you.” 

134 



“More the aftermath that the bat- 
tle. Bowing to public opinion in the 
person of Jake Daven and rejustily- 
ing our existence. The first draft’s 
done at least.” 

‘‘Done! You deserve a rest 
then.” Cindy turned to Russ. 
“Hey, you, our rest’s just about up. 
Ready for another round?” 

Russ downed his coffee. “Work. 
I’m surrounded by the Protestant 
Work Ethic. Maybe I’ll renounce 
God and become a happy slug- 
gard.” 

Cindy grinned at Alice. “We’ve 
still got to finish the tests of re- 
flexes on the one-month fetus in 
tank 6.” She stood and pulled Russ 
to his feet. “Come on, you slug- 
gard.” 

Alice watched them toss their 
cups carelessly into the trash and 
hurry from the room. 

Alice leaned back in her chair 
and listened to the humming of the 
hive: the murmurs of the few people 
left in the room, the humming of 
the refrigerator unit across the hall, 
the rattle of typewriters, the rustling 
noises of hurrying people. Sound 
washed across her mind in a con- 
tinuous hum, something was wrong, 
a steady hum, a hive of bees with 
something missing, {rersistent hum. 

Daydreaming again, she caught 
herself, preoccupied with sound. 
Nothing she could think of, nothing 
she could catch, but the hum. She 
gulped at her coffee and burned her 
tongue. Bone weary and daydream- 
ing, the coffee would do no good 

GALAXY 




for that. Maybe she’d rest a bit be- 
fore going back to work; first draft 
done on the report, the rest could 
wait a bit. There was a couch in the 
women’s room. She’d lie down a 
while, and go back to work fresh. It 
was cool in the air-conditioned 
building; she could forget the warm 
and pressing darkness that had 
plagued her in the night. She should 
have forgotten already. She’d never 
remembered her dreams before. An 
old woman’s memory — Alice 

frowned — an old woman’s nap. She 
stood to leave. 

“Alice. Wait.’’ Old Jake Daven, 
she thought. Dr. Daven hurried 
from the counter with a coffee cup 
in his hand. “Just wanted to talk to 
you for a minute.’’ 

“A minute’s all I have, Jake. 
Time’s running out.’’ Ten years ago 
she’d never have predicted Jake for 
division head. He’d never had the 
wisdom, skill, or patience of many 
others. But now the others were 
gone — retired — and Jake looked a 
division head — thick-waisted, 

grey-headed, black-suited. Empty 
headed Jake was still here and time 
was running out for her too. 

“I’m glad I caught you. I hope 
you’ve cooled down some since this 
morning. I’m sure it won’t take you 
long to write up a progress report 
and present it to the board.” 

Yes, she’d cooled down some. 
Cool as ice. A regular frosty old 
woman, frozen to the marrow and 
ready to melt, this summer day. 
“Yes, Jake, the report’s done.” 



“Good.” Jake looked more like 
he was trying to soothe himself than 
her. Good Jake, he was saying to 
himself, it was all right. “I just 
wanted you to understand. The 
board got a petition signed by five 
hundred women. All objecting to 
your research. So we just have to 
call a reconsideration, at least until 
the newspapers stop talking about 
it. Can’t have all this upset, you 
understand — might even get the 
government involved.” 

Five hundred women — ^you could 
get people to sign anything by 
standing in front of a supermarket 
and looking respectable. (“Of 
course you’ve heard about the terri- 
ble research going on at the Univer- 
sity? Well it’s just terrible and we 
plan to put a stop to it.”) And the 
government. That’s right — Jake’s 
pet project involved a government 
grant — the work he did to be sure 
he was still considered a scientist. 
Yes, she understood . now if 
only he’d let her rest. Get away 
from the hum and find out what 
was missing. She nodded. “Yes, 
Jake, I understand.” 

“Good.’’ He looked relieved 
now. An angry top researcher 
calmed down — all in a day’s work. 
“I’ll let you go now. Always busy, 
right?” He was a little too hearty. 
She thought he even looked embar- 
rassed by his own over-acting. 

“Right, Jake.” She turned and 
walked to the door, dropping her 
coffee cup deliberately in the trash 
and walking slowly out, careful lest 

135 



NO MOTHER NEAR 




her fragile, still-frozen bones break, 
as if she were a fetus with still-soft 
bones. 

She pushed the door to the wom- 
en’s room gently, as if her wrist 
would bend if she pushed too hard. 
She lay on the couch on her back 
and closed her eyes. So soft, so 
warm. She could thaw and rest 
here. The room seemed as warm as 
her house at night. And the refrig- 
eration unit next door hummed 
soothingly. 

Hum. After she’d lost the baby, 
she’d gone to see a psychiatrist. 
Frank had insisted. She couldn’t 
remember the man's face, that was 
blurred by time. But she could re- 
member his office. Too warm, with 
a chair too soft (he was too modem 
for a couch) and a clock that hum- 
med ... it annoyed the hell out of 
her, that hum. 

“Well, Alice, try to describe 
what feels wrong to you.’’ (Hum.) 

“I . something’smissing . .’’ 

“Yes.” (Hum.) 

“Something’s wrong. It’s all so 
empty; no more but there should be 
more, and ...” She shook her 
head at the futility of trying to de- 
scribe her feelings. 

“Yes, Alice?’’ (Hum.) Every 
remark was punctuated by the 
clock’s steady hum. 

She looked at his hands, soft and 
white and clasped quietly on his 
desk, young-man-on-his-way-up, 
listening to pain and saying “Yes.” 
next he’d tell her that many women 
felt that way and that . 

136 



“Alice, many women feel that 
way after losing a child. Just talk it 
out and ...” 

She picked up the humming clock 
that sat on the comer of his dest, 
big numbers proclaiming 2:30, and 
smashed it against the desk. She 
cracked the face and dented the 
desk, but the hum went on. She 
threw the clock to the floor and 
stamped on it with an ineffectual 
heel. She’d stamp on it like an in- 
significant bug. But the hum went 
on. 

“Now, Alice ...” He was be- 
side her now . “Many women 
feel that way, but that’s no reason 
to ... ” 

She kicked his shin and wrenched 
her elbow from the pasty hand that 
was closing on it. She stooped and 
picked up the clock, swung it 
around her head, and hurled it 
across the room. It travelled in slow 
motion. She watched fascinated — it 
flew across the room in a slow arc 
and the plug pulled out. The hum 
stopped. Stopped. And the darkness 
quit pressing so close. 

She opened her eyes. The refrig- 
eration unit next door still hummed. 
Her knees were pressed against her 
chest. One hand was up to her 
mouth, the other, close at her side. 
Her chin was down. Her lab coat 
was twisted awkwardly and she felt 
cramped, like she’d been lying in a 
space too small for her. She 
straightened slowly and lay on her 
back again. 

That wasn’t the way the visit to 

GALAXY 




the young psychiatrist had gone. 
She’d listened to the doctor politely, 
endured the humming of his clock, 
ignored the platitudes he’d spouted, 
walked calmly away from his of- 
fice, and never returned. No vio- 
lence, no fuss. She just hadn’t been 
able to describe the longing, aching, 
empty feeling of a childless womb, 
no child to carry, all she could say 
was an empty feeling, something 
missing. She was hollow; strike her 
and she’d echo. Something 
missing — like she’d felt in her 
dreams, like she felt now ... no 
not now. Now the feeling was like 
something gone that had never been 
there, rather than something gone, 
just out of reach. Now it was like 
yearning after something that never 
was. The other she’d felt up 
til . up til the clock stopped 
humming. So strange, so strange. 

Alice stood and straightened her 
skirt. She stretched. She didn’t feel 
tired; she pushed the door quite sure 
her wrist wouldn’t bend or break, 
stepped out into the hall confident 
her bones wouldn't melt. Amazing 
what a short nap could do. She felt 
reborn. 

She even smiled at Cindy and 
Russ as she walked into the lab. 
They stood by tank 3; both looking 
worried. She felt like throwing their 
own words back — don’t worry; 
we’ll weather it. 

“What are you two looking so 
worried about now.’’ 

Cindy didn’t return the smile. 
“Tank 3. No changes in anything. 

NO MOTHER NEAR 



Hormone levels, fine. Temperature, 
normal. But the fetus died.” 

The chart registered a smooth line 
for the heartbeat. The hum of the 
chart sounded loud in the lab. In the 
tank, the nutrient flow through the 
fetus’s veins had stopped. The fetus 
had died and it heard the hum of 
the chart no more. 

Alice knew what she’d find by 
the notation for tank 3 in the record 
book. She knew she’d look it up lat- 
er that night after she’d shed her 
Dr. Woods assurance and cried. 
The fight was over — she’d fought 
the M.F.M. and Jake and would 
have won; the child had fought the 
darkness and lost. 

She’d fought the wrong fight. It 
was always easier to fight outer 
enemies — she’d found it easier to 
fight Frank than the cold emptiness, 
easier to fight Jake than the dark- 
ness. 

The project would end. When 
Susie and other donors began to 
wake from troubled dreams, when 
each fetus died a mysterious death, 
the project would end. 

It was lonely in the tank with the 
dark pressing close. And something 
was missing, a mother’s heartbeat, 
breathing, warm mind uncon- 
sciously near. Alone in a tank. The 
mother’s mind was near enough to 
grab, but not near enough to keep 
the darkness from pressing too 
close. 

She would look it up. She didn’t 
know who donated the sperm, but 
she knew whose was the egg. ★

Half a rack, half a rack, half a 



rack onward; into the Valley Of 
Books strolls the Spider. Turkeys to 
the right of me, turkeys to the left 
of me, here and there an old friend 
looking embarrassed at the company 
he’s keeping these days (“ . and 
the pig got up and slowly walked 
away.”). But somewhere beyond all 
these Jacqueline Susanns and Harold 
Robbinses and (o di immortales!) 
Norman Mailers, lies a magic land I 
know of old, the watering hole from 
which over the years I have sipped 
untold gallons of psychedelic nec- 
tar, whose taste confers visions: The 
SF Section. 

What it is, you see, is the old 
man-in-the- street caper (as opposed 
to the Old Man In The Street 
Caper, which is an insurance fraud 
and an altogether different proposi- 
tion). The stated purpose of this 
column is to aid the man or woman 
standing in the SF section with a 
few spare surplus dollars to invest 



140 




them wisely. Only a fraction of the 
books offered there to you, the 
hypothetical consumer, are the 
brand-new, hot-off-the-presses stuff 
I get in the mail — and I cannot as- 
sume that you are a card-carrying 
Fan, familiar with everything 
printed in the last thirty years (al- 
though I often tend to anyhow), nor 
are my own credentials in that area 
impeccable. 

And so it came to pass that that 
editor fellow, the Baen of my exis- 
tence these days, called me up a 
few days ago, and after we got past 
the unpleasant part about this col- 
umn being two weeks late, he 
suggested that I become my as- 
sumed audience — that is, stagger 
down to my local bookstore, harvest 
there whatever fruits struck my fan- 
cy, and send the tab to Galaxy. 
This is something like the old 
“naked in Neiman-Marcus with a 
checkbook” wheeze, and 1 agreed 
at once. Disguising myself as you, I 
hied me to the nearest paper palace 
(which shall remain nameless until 
they start picking up on my hints 
about The 01’ Plugola), and fell 
upon the above-mentioned SF sec- 
tion like the wolves upon the cen- 
terfold. Over the next few months 
I’ll be covering the goodies I 
gathered in that single raid, and 
there are four in this installment 
alone. Onward. 

* * * 

When I sat down to read Options, 
Bob Sheckley’s first novel in eight 



years, I happened to have just 
finished explaining to my friend and 
neighbor Dan Parker why he ought 
not to buy Dhalgren (a service I’d 
have done you folks too if Lester 
Del Rey hadn’t already done so, de- 
finitively, in Analog). I therefore 
went through at least three quarters 
of Options in a state of clinical 
schizophrenia unequalled since my 
three-headed grandfather punched 
himself in the mouth. 

Because Sheck did almost every 
single one of the things Delany did 
wrong in Dhalgren, committed the 
same unpardonable sins, frustrated 
the same reasonable expectations — 
and made me love it. 

Deliriously illogical background, 
brazenly proclaimed inconsistencies, 
a boring protagonist, shifting prem- 
ises, blatant self-indulgence, aim- 
less plot, pointless “motivations,” 
even the final Juvenility of the au- 
thor inserting himself bodily into 
the work to comment on it — the 
only ones he missed were the osten- 
tatious punctuation tricks and the 
begin - and - end - in - the - middle - of 
- a-sentence gag. 

Sheckley cheerfully acknowledges 
all these things; in fact, they seem 
to be ... er ... the point. 

Now, Lester said something to 
the effect that in a story where ab- 
solutely anything can happen, who 
the hell cares what does? I agree, I 
agree — and yet somehow that sum- 
bitch Sheckley kept me turning 
pages until there weren’t any more, 
whereupon I wished there were. 



141 




This initially confounded me. 

It was, as I say, about three quar- 
ters of the way through that I 
explained it to myself: you can’t 
judge a pie in the face by the same 
standards you would apply to breast 
of guinea hen under glass. You 
don’t use the same critical tools on 
Spike Jones that you do on Beeth- 
oven. 

All writers, it seems, dream se- 
cretly of writing stream-of- 
consciousness stuff, on the theory 
that the inside of their head is the 
most fascinating place in the world 
of literature — I myself have resisted 
only because I’m not yet prestigious 
enough to sell such crap. But if you 
are going to write off the top of 
your head, the only way in the 
world you’ll get away with it is to 
be hilarious. 

Sheckley is hilarious, funnier 
than the missionary position. His 
book is an exploding cigarette, a 
velvet banana, a bearded tractor, a 
Presbyterian platypus, a polka-dot 
baseball glove, a Chinese air raid, 
and/or none or all of the above. It 
will probably make your mind sog- 
gy. If that sounds good to you, 
you’ll like it. If not, not, and to hell 
with you. 

Send a mutant to Ibiza today: 
pick up Sheckley’s Options.

If you haven’t read F.M. Busby’s 
To Cage A Man by now, your name 
is Mudd. Run out and get a copy, if 
only so that you can properly ap- 

142 



predate Busby’s entirely satisfac- 
tory sequel. The Proud Enemy. 

Not that you must; Enemy stands 
on its own. But knowing the 
background will raise it that one 
notch from “good” to “excellent” 
for you. The only faint, lingering 
objection I had to Cage when I read 
it a year or so ago was that the 
alien Demu seemed like cardboard 
villains from Space Opera Central 
Casting, performing savage 
atrocities on humans and others in a 
rather cliched Master Race syn- 
drome. Enemy sinks that gripe, with 
a beautiful explanation of the Demu 
arrogance that makes cultural sense. 

To his magnificent character Bar- 
ton, the man who always doubts the 
unproven, Busby adds a host of de- 
lightfully real, human people 
(perhaps some of the friendly aliens 
are a bit too human too, but what 
the hell?), and leads them through 
an exciting series of events, cul- 
minating in one of those tomato- 
surprise endings that makes you 
wonder why you weren’t expecting 
it. 

There are flaws in the book — the 
planetary defenses of Sisshain are 
just a bit too feeble to be plausible 
(even granting that it’s not actually 
lived on), the Demu’s most sacred 
secret place just a bit too easily 
burgled. Profound this book ain’t, 
exactly, but it’s exciting, entertain- 
ing, well-thought-out and carefully 
crafted. It reminds me subtly of my 
own first novel, forthcoming from 
the same publishers whenever I 

GALAXY 




finish the damned thing. 

In other words, you’ll love it.

The next two yummies I picked 
from the rack were a pair of Har- 
lans, both reprints, but each in a 
different sense. This is no 
surprise — Harlan sells a piece the 
way some folks sell the Brooklyn 
Bridge: over and over again. Which 
is a break for you. 

If, for instance, you happened not 
to be a regular reader of the L.A. 
Free Press (don’t be silly — none of 
the Freep’s readers are regular) be- 
tween Feb. 13, 1970 and March 26, 
1971, or of Rolling Stone on May 
11 and 25 of 1972, you might have 
missed the columns which make up 
The Other Glass Teat, inevitably- 
named sequel to The Glass Teat. 
Thanks to Pyramid, this mission can 
now be rectified. 

What’s a book of television criti- 
cism, and three-to-five year old TV 
criticism at that, doing in an SF 
book review? Well, for one thing, 
SF is occasionally and trenchantly 
discussed, since Harlan can’t very 
well help but be what he is — for in- 
stance, he dissects with magnificent 
skill the execrable “SF” TV- 
movie. The Love War, which still 
surfaces on late-night TV today. 
For another thing, a lot of the os- 
tensibly straight television examined 
by Dr. Ellison sure sounds like sci- 
ence fiction to me. 

Enough justifying — what the 
book is like is, as the cover copy 
states, a series of Drano martinis. 

BOOKSHELF 



Or a butane lighter refilled with 
napalm. Or any metaphor you like 
for a succession of words that are 
corrosive, explosive, and incisive 
all at the same time. The stirring 
saga of Harlan’s appearance on The 
Dating Game is alone worth the 
price of admission (they ended up 
burning the tape), and the “Dear 
Mom” column written immediately 
after the Kent State massacre seems 
chiseled in stone by gnashing teeth. 
Harlan does not merely criticize 
what he saw on the trube — he ex- 
trapolates, to show its effects on 
the thousands and thousands who 
suck up that pap every day. Is this 
not what SF is all about? 

Also, a complete Ellison script 
for The Young Lawyers is included 
(a quick course in script- 
mechanics), along with a blow-by- 
blow on how the script was cas- 
trated in production.

The other Ellison is a reprint 
(from 1971) of a collection which 
Avon foolishly let go. Its title is 
apt: Partners In Wonder. It com- 
prises thirteen stories and a batch of 
ape cartoons written by Harlan in 
collaboration with the likes of Ben 
Bova, Bob Sheckley, Avram David- 
son, Ted Sturgeon, Joe Hensely, 
William Rotsler, A.E. Van Vogt, 
Henry Slesar, Samuel R. Delany, 
Algis Budrys, Robert Silverberg, 
Keith Laumer and Roger Zelazny. 
If that ain’t worth a buck and a 
half, I don’t know what is. 

Eveiything in the book is worth 

143 




reading at least once (with the ex- 
ception of the Ellison-Rotsler King 
Kong cartoons, which are uniformly 
dumb), and magnificent is not too 
strong a word for the best of them. 
Ellison/Sheckley’s “I See A Man 
Sitting On A Chair, And The Chair 
Is Biting His Leg” is a classic, as 
are Ellison/Bo va’s “Brillo” (which 
nearly became an ABC-TV series), 
Ellison/Silverberg’s ‘‘The Song The 
Zombie Sang,” and ‘‘Street Scene” 
(in which Harlan and Keith Laumer 
couldn’t agree on an ending and so 
offer you two). In addition you get 
the usual Ellison introductions, info 
not only on the writers themselves 
but on the fine art of collaboration. 

A Best Buy.

So much for the ones I picked off 
the rack. Now we come to The 
Things That Grew In The Mailbox. 
The first of these, happily, is a 
genuine gumdrop: a scattergun col- 
lection of true classics in the field. 

In The Liberated Future, Robert 
Hoskins has assembled a pile of 
stories as diverse as they are de- 
lightful, definitive examples of sev- 
eral different kinds of SF. There 
are, for instance, Poul Anderson’s 
immortal ‘‘Sam Hall”; Cyril 
Kornbluth’s ‘‘The Little Black 
Bag”; Sheckley’s ‘‘Street of 
Dreams, Feet of Clay” (his name 
does seem to keep coming up, 
doesn’t it?); and Ursula K. Leguin’s 
‘‘A Trip To The Head,” to name 
but a few. I ‘‘didn’t like” some of 
them — that is, I don’t much care for 

144 



that kind of story — but all are hon- 
estly and well written. 

Never mind that the title and os- 
tensible theme of the collection 
— ‘‘Liberation” — can be made to 
cover all these stories only by 
stretching the premise to the point 
where, plucked, it would emit a G 
two octaves above middle C. Who 
the hell cares? If faking a “theme” 
made it easier for Hoskins to sell 
Fawcett on the notion of publishing 
these goodies, then what matter if 
sings aren’t always what they 
theme? (sorry.) 

Other authors represented are 
R.A. Lafferty, Katherine MacLean, 
Henry Kuttner, Dean R. Koontz, 
Joe L. Hensley, Barry Malzberg, 
Anne McCaffrey and William Tenn. 
If you’ve got a friend which you 
don’t know what he likes but you 
wanna turn him on to SF — or if you 
want to expand your own 
horizons — try this. 

* * * 

Let’s drop fiction for a second, 
and get into fact. Science fact, or, 
to be precise, ecological fact. 

Everybody knows that city air 
will kill you even quicker than 
country whiskey, right? Everybody 
knows that man is destroying the 
life-giving oxygen in his atmosphere 
in ever-increasing amounts. Every- 
body knows Lake Erie is dead. 
Everybody knows those damned oil 
spills are destroying our oceans. 
Everybody. 

Now, you can’t say flat out that 
anything “everybody knows” must 

GALAXY 




be wrong. For instance, everybody 
knows that Gerry Ford has the intel- 
lectual acumen of a prenatal wood- 
chuck, and that is true. But the 
phrase ought to make you suspi- 
cious. 

And so, in Ecological Fantasies 
(subtitled “Death By Falling 
Watermelons”), Cy A. Adler pre- 
sents a raft of evidence that doesn’t 
jibe too well with what “everybody 
knows” about ecology. He cites, 
for example, studies which find no 
connection between lung cancer or 
emphysema and living in a city; 
which find more edible fish in Lake 
Erie than in any other Great Lake; 
which find no perceptible degrada- 
tion of world oxygen levels over the 
past thirty years; which show that 
oil spills in the open ocean (at least) 
are converted by bacteria into food 
for marine organisms. The man of- 
fers hard evidence — I do not say 
proof — against these and a dozen 
other alleged ecological catas- 
trophes. 

However, although I am in ac- 
cord with Adler’s stated purpose 
(“A defense of innovation, science, 
and rational approaches to environ- 
mental problems”), I must rec- 
ommend you take this book with a 
football-size grain of salt. Much of 
Adler’s reasoning strikes me as 
specious, some of his sources are 
not what I’d call impeccable, and at 
best he sometimes ends only by 
proving that things may not be quite 
so bad as some people say. The 
book appears to be aimed at the lib- 



erals who are dying for an excuse to 
dump this ecology crap and do the 
world some less expensive good. 

But if you read it with your Built 
In Shit Detector at maximum gain 
you’ll find it one of the most fact- 
packed and background-informative 
books since Ben Bova’s The New 
Astronomies (Mentor Books), which 
it it no way resembles. Check it 
out, fellow eco-freaks. Hear the 
other side; they are not all villains. 

* * * 

Back to fiction. 

I scarcely know what to say 
about Orbit 16, which is rny usual 
reaction to avatars of that series. 
Damon has a knack for collecting 
precisely that type of SF story 
which tends to give me a pain just 
beneath the small of the back. You 
know, that think-piece stuff that’s 
good on poetic prose and literary al- 
lusion and like heavy metaphors and 
typographical tricks to induce mood 
and gallons of allegory and mostly 
what the judges for the first John 
W. Campbell Memorial Award (as 
opposed to the plain-old John W 
Campbell Award that You lovely 
people gave me last year) were 
pleased to call “recognition of the 
fallen state of Man.” And which 
isn’t exactly strong on stuff like 
characterization and plot and an ac- 
tual ending and all that hopelessly 
square stuff. 

This is, of course, a generaliza- 
tion. I have read many fine stories 
in Orbit collections. But there have 
been many, many, many stories in 

145 



BOOKSHELF 




Orbit collections. I guess a lot of 
you must like ’em — they sell like 
hell. But I don’t mind admitting I 
have failed to understand or enjoy 
most of ’em myself. 

And even if you are an Orbit fan, 
I’m not sure you’ll like Number 
Sixteen. It ain’t a total loss, but a 
lot of the stories are manifestly by 
newcomers, first-sales or nearly so, 
and the Jesse Miller entry is the 
first he ever wrote and not a patch 
on “Pigeon City.” 

Worse, Damon leavens the stories 
with anecdotes and funnies that 
largely lay there and die. There is, 
for instance, a remake of Victor 
Borge’s One-Up English (“Anytwo 
for elevennis?”) called “The Little 
Lexicon For Time Travelers,” of 
which “Wasaac Asimov” and 
‘‘Ante Toasties” are entirely 
enough examples. 

I may not know what I like, but I 
know Art (a hammernosed old 
Serbo-Croation who cobbles my 
snowshoes for me), and he wouldn’t 
like this book. You might, but I 
couldn’t guarantee it. 

* * * 

One last toke and then I’ve got to 
be getting home, but I couldn’t miss 
a chance to alert you to a 
thoroughly meaty book, dripping 
with juices and delicately marbled. 
All I really need to say, of course, 
is that it’s a Poul Anderson collec- 
tion; but since you may conceivably 
have been suffering from rectocra- 
nial inversion for the last few de- 
cades, I’ll redundantly state that 

146 



Homeward And Beyond contains 
some of the best stories I’ve read in 
this or any year. 

A couple are SF only because 
Poul says so and who’s going to ar- 
gue with him? A couple are dis- 
tinctly minor — ‘‘Wings Of Vic- 
tory,” for example, is notable only 
because it is the first story concern- 
ing the Ythrians of Poul’s almost- 
Hugo- winner People Of The Wind. 

But “The Long Remembering,” 
“Murphy’s Hall” (a collaboration 
with his lovely wife Karen), “Peek! 
I See You!” (Christ, what a title), 
“Goat Song,” and most particularly 
‘‘The Pirate” and the incredibly 
tender and moving “The Peat Bog” 
are so damn good they had me 
babbling aloud as I read them (don’t 
b’lieve me, ask my wife Jeanne). 
They range from hard-science to 
no-science, and include Harlanesque 
introductions by Poul that are a 
treat. Don’t miss this collection — 
it’s the dromedary’s drawers. 

Only one “mini-review” (“tome- 
capsule”?) this month; 

Has Anyone Else Got Anything 
Further To Add? by R.A. Lafferty. 
You either like Lafferty or you 
don’t — I do. This here’s a bunch of 
typical Lafferty. There you go. (I 
find sixteen shaggy-dog stories in a 
row a little heavy, but you could 
maybe read it intermittently over the 
next year.) 

See you next month; Near as I 
can guess the next column’s due out 
about Thanksgiving — maybe we can 
carve up some turkeys for ya. .★

The armies of Earth were 
invinceable— for who can 
defeat a True Believer? 



Taint and far away, the dim 
memory of a warning bell. Dean 
stirred, uneasy. The sky was blue, a 
few scattered clouds, fleecy-white. 
In the meadow, glints of gold where 
flowers clustered. Beyond stood 
trees, cool and green. A little longer 
to rest, then he would seek the 
shade. Find a bubbling stream from 
which to drink. But for now the 
suns were warm . 

* * * 

Two suns! Instantly he was 
awake, the warm lush meadow re- 
placed by plastic and cold steel. 
The palm of his hand hit the trans- 
mitter button, swept across the row 
of switches that armed the scout’s 
defenses. 

First contact with the aliens! He 
had been set down on this deserted, 
empty planet of an undistinguished 
star nearly a month ago, living bait 
and alarm system. The first-in 
scoutship had landed a year ago, 
reported its landing — and vanished. 
A second scout, forwarned of 
danger, the same. 

Little chance of double malfunc- 



tion or simple physical attack; a 
scout craft’s screens could hold off 
any gross battering long enough to 
cry warning. The prime possibility 
was a purely mental attack. The 
Brains, the great, sentient comput- 
ers that charted the course of history 
to come had picked Dean, tested 
and trained him to resist this kind of 
attack. Still he had nearly failed. 

His transmitter hurled its warning 
forth across the parsecs. “Okaro to 
Base. Dean Okaro to Sector Base 
III. Am under attack. Projected illu- 
sions. Earth-normal scene, except 
for two suns.” 

He spoke each word clearly, 
slowly despite his excitement. The 
computers could unscramble the 
message easily, given his voice 
prints for comparison . 

The tap-tap-tapping of his mallet 
was the only sound, deep under the 
earth. He crouched there in the 
gloom, scarcely able to see the pat- 
tern he was chipping in the stone. It 
had to be done right or the Gods 
would be angry, the hunt would 
fail. The people would go hungry, 
and it would ^ his fault. 

Behind him Ee-La placed another 
fragment of wood on the fire. Hers 
was the equally important task of 
tending the sacred flames, making 
the scanty supply of fuel last until 
his work was done. Too little 
flame, and he could not see. Too 
much, and the light would not last. 

His eyes ached as he followed the 
lines. The charcoal strokes lay dark 
against the gray rock. This line was 



148 



for the stream. There the prey 
would come to drink. This line, the 
wind. It must not carry the hunter’s 
scent ahead. A heavier line, rising 
and falling. The land that upheld 
hunter and hunted alike. This row 
of dots, the footsteps of the hunter. 
That one, larger, more solid; the 
hunted. 

Now they came together — but the 
light was fading fast. Fading, as the 
day would fade if the hunter ran too 
slow. Ee-La stirred the coals, coax- 
ing a last flicker of orange against 
the dark. He worked faster, mallet 
falling in a frenzy of blows. The 
last spark faded, but he was done! 
The hunt would not fail. Leaving 
his tools where they had fallen he 
led the way toward the light of day. 
Ee-La followed close, anxious to be 
out from under the weight of the 
Sacred Mountain. 

The air was fresh and good be- 
neath the low arching trees. Ee-La 
stood close, her eyes raised to his. 
Like chips of emerald against her 
pale blue skin . 

# # 

Dean wrenched himself back to 
reality. He spoke stacatto phrases 
into the microphone, telling of this 
latest attack on his mind. Every de- 
tail would be of value, revealing vi- 
tal facts about this enemy. Facts 
that could perhaps be put together 
to make a larger pattern of strengths 
and weaknesses. It was already plain 
that they were not from this tiny 
barren world, with its reddish sun. 



He let his mind drift, eager for 
more knowledge . 

Again the suns beat down, dark- 
ening his leathery skin from blue 
to purple. His whip, symbol of 
status as field-foreman, dangled idly 
from his wrist. The workers, knee 
deep in squelchy brown mud, 
moved more slowly as his attention 
wandered. He drank sparingly from 
his flask, the trace of drug in the 
water bracing his will. Once more 
the workers quickened their move- 
ments, their drowsing minds re- 
sponsive to his commands. At the 
back of his own mind was a dull re- 
sentment. To drive cattle such as 
these! They were the dregs of the 
work force, good for nothing but 
the simplest, most repetitive tasks. 
He must keep his thoughts almost 
on a level with theirs, or contact 
would be lost. 

‘‘Ho, Darveel!” The laughing 
voice broke in on his thoughts. 
“Bring your workers to high-suns 
meal.” 

“Gladly, Jarvon.” 

The workers straightened broad 
backs, setting down their baskets of 
seedlings. There was a wholeness 
here, a rightness between the slow, 
heavy movements and their earthy 
task. Broad flat feet left splotches 
of glistening mud on the trampled 
ground as they crowded about the 
food cart. 

“How goes the planting?” On 
some hot afternoon a bored field- 
foreman had called a worker from 
her tasks to relieve the tedium. Jar- 



149 




von was the result, a mind of at 
least moderate power housed in the 
body of a small worker-woman. 
Idly Darveel sent out a command 
for her to approach. 

“It goes well. The plants are set- 
ting in as rapidly as might be ex- 
pected. These brutes are but poor 
things, barely able to move one flat 
foot past the other without guid- 
ance.” 

He frowned. The compulsion was 
having no effect. He pulled harder. 

“They are good enough for work 
such as this.” She smiled, pointed 
teeth pink against azure lips. 
“Surely so skilled a field-foreman 
has no trouble guiding them.” 

This was ridiculous! She still 
hadn’t moved any nearer . and 
he had the strangest urge to get 
down on all fours. His teeth 
clenched as he made a greater ef- 
fort. The workers had done eating, 
were wandering off to sit under a 
nearby grove of trees for unau- 
thorized rest. No matter. 

Jarvon was approaching one slow 
step at a time, but he was sinking to 
one knee. 

Stronger! Fiercer! The drive that 
had brought him from humble clerk 
to field-foreman now centered on 
Jarvon. She stood before him, her 
slender six-fingered hand unbelting 
her coarse tunic. 

He was down on both knees, 
straining to keep his body erect. His 
will beat like a roaring gale: Jarvon 
was a slender reed that bent and 
sprang erect. He struggled to his 

150 



feet, his eyes locked with hers. 
Now each tried to force the other to 
give way. Feet braced wide on the 
muddy ground, they swayed like 
dancers to unheard music. 

She dropped to one knee, her 
tunic falling away, then to both 
knees. She lay full length, belly to 
the ground. He crouched beside her. 
Slowly, slowly she rolled onto her 
back . but her eyes told him that 
somehow she had won, he had 
lost .

“Dean Okaro to Base. More data 
on enemy. This episode seems to be 
from early history of their civiliza- 
tion.” He told of the fragment of 
life he had lived, knowing how vital 
any scrap of information could be. 
Once conquered, this race could 
contribute much to the Great 
Crusade . 

The two armies were drawn up in 
precise array. On two low hills the 
commanding generals faced each 
other, ready for the supreme test. 
Dilleshon might have been a pale 
blue statue, but for a droplet of 
sweat that trickled from beneath his 
helmet. The tension . Oh, the 
tension! 

One step forward! Again silence. 
Then the sound of the other army 
moving as one man. One step. Then 
two. Now he was moving again, 
lending his will to the massed men- 
tal force of his fellows. Behind 
them the General led and drove. 
The swordsmen of the front rank 



GALAXY 




met the foe. Now fast, now slow 
they cut and slashed. Faster as their 
massed will commanded, slow as 
the enemy’s force prevailed. 

The helmet pressed down on Dil- 
leshon’s skull. Open at the back, it 
was supposed to shield him from 
the enemy’s commands. He was 
strong! They were moving faster 
now, hurling their will before them. 
The enemy swirled away, falling 
and dying. The General was 
stronger, his will striking like a 
lance at the enemy’s heart! 

Their foes were falling, dropping 
to the ground before they were even 
touched by steel. There would be 
triumph tonight, enemy women 
dancing to their commands. Victory 
to the strong! 

But no. What was this? Behind 
them the enemy sprang erect. He 
was cut off from his fellows. The 
mass will faltered, dissolved into 
chaos. His helmet was struck from 
his head, and he turned to flee. 

No use. He and his fellows were 
marching once more, but their 
weapons were gone. Their armor 
lay scattered on the field of battle. 
They would watch, but the women 
would not be dancing for them. 
Dimly he sensed the truth, that 
strength was not enough without in- 
telligence to show the way .

The defenses of Dean’s scout 
were weakening, but still he broad- 
cast his message. The aliens’ own 
strengths would be turned against

them, and the computers would tell 
them how it could be done. He 
could watch the illusions now with- 
out wholly losing himself in them. 
Each life-fragment taught him more 
about the powers that he fought. If 
rescue came in time, he might 
even . 

The fat-bellied ships lurched 
ahead. Long weeks of empty ocean 
lay behind. Ahead? No man knew. 
Old sailors told of monsters, guard- 
ing cities paved with gold. Or else 
of waters pouring over the edge of 
the world, taking unwary ships with 
them into eternity. Dalseth was 
roused from his thoughts by a cry 
from aloft. 

“Land ho!” 

In response to that most welcome 
of shouts, several men scrambled 
aloft, eager to see for themselves. 
Too often they had been fooled by 
low lying clouds, but this time it 
was true. It was land, green with 
trees. White surging waves on crim- 
son sand. There should be food, 
and cool water to drink. They found 
a cove and droppted anchor. 

Solid ground felt strange under 
his feet. It had been long indeed 
since they had been ashore. First pi- 
rates had pursued them, driving 
them far out to sea and away from 
the normal shipping lanes. They had 
been saved only by the rain and 
darkness of a sudden storm, though 
this too had taken them even farther 
from land. 

Worst of all, their hull had be- 
come so fouled that they could not 

152 



beat their way back against the pre- 
vailing winds. All they could do 
was to forge ahead, hoping to find 
land before their water was gone. 

Dalseth led one of the exploring 
parties. They eased along through 
the tangled jungle growth, weapons 
at the ready. Men such as he, who 
could control the minds of animals, 
were rare, and their power over less- 
er minds was weak. Already they 
had found good water and fresh 
fruits. They were following a game 
trail when Dalseth sensed movement 
ahead. A shout and one of the 
sailors was down, an arrow in his 
throat! 

Then Dalseth seized control of 
the savage minds and the ambush 
died as suddenly as it had begun. 

Weapons falling limply from their 
hands, the natives waited passively 
as the sailors surged forward, intent 
on vengeance. 

“No,” snapped Dalseth, “weTl 
take them back to the ship. The 
Captain’ll want to see them, find 
out what he can about them and 
their tribe. Four of you carry Vor- 
lupp’s body. We’ll give him proper 
burial back at camp.” 

The natives were small folk, their 
dusky bluish hides stretched tightly 
over frail bones. Their minds which 
were poorly developed, told 
of others who lived farther inland. 
These, they said, were great war- 
riors who lived in large villages. 

When the seasonal winds changed 
the ships would sail for home, the 
Captain decided. They would bear 

GALAXY 




word of this new land, so ripe 
for the taking. Other ships would 
follow in their wake, and soon 
this land would deliver up its 
riches . 

* * * , 

Dean heard the clangor of riven 
metal as the shell of his scout re- 
sisted the attack. His screens were 
drained, but he still had some time 
left, and power for his transmitter. 
This race too would fall to the 
forces of righteousness; once again 
the Great Crusade would gather in 
new converts. Earth could not fail. 
The whole galaxy would join in 
hymns of praise. 

When at last all intelligence was 
as one in God’s sight, then the task 
would be done. But as long as there 
were whole races denied the right to 
Glory they must press onward. 

Dean’s hand ached from gripping 
the base of the microphone, but a 
little pain was nothing to a True Be- 
liever. His piety and quick wits had 
brought him to this distant planet. 
He hardly remembered his child- 
hood in the slums of Johannesburg. 
Whether or not he returned from 
this mission alive, the name of 
Dean Okaro would be enshrined . 

The derrai shuffled his feet in the 
sand, setting himself to meet the 
animal’s charge. Behind the in- 
sulating screens the crowd watched 
avidly. 

The huge unibos moved forward 
slowly at first, then, silver horn 
gleaming against black hide, it 



charged. Empty-handed, clad only 
in silken shorts he waited, poised, 
unmoving. 

The picture built in his mind and 
he sent it forth. The unibos swerved 
the merest fraction, but it was 
enough. The beast’s shoulder 
brushed his as it thundered by. 

The unibos was herded away. 
Two jungle cats were let in. Their 
minds were small but cunning, hard 
to reach. They circled the arena, 
scaly hides gleaming in the light of 
the two suns. One cat yowled as it 
caught his scent, but now he was 
ready. They sprang at a small her- 
bivore. It dashed away. Hunting 
screams echoed as they charged af- 
ter it, circling the arena. Try as they 
would, it stayed always just out of 
the hot sand refusing to move until 
efforts. 

At last they lay sprawled on the 
hot sand refusing to move until 
prodded. He was proud of that illu- 
sion. Last game-time a contestant 
had taken the image of a tree in the 
minds of the jungle cats. One cat 
had sharpened its claws on his bark, 
ending the trial. 

He faced them all, one by one 
and in twos and threes. These minds 
could not be compelled; they could 
only be led astray. At last the ulti- 
mate test. A single door swung 
open across the darkened arena.

stands. The beast that slouched to-

grayish tan. Eyeless head, fanged

CRUSADE 




mouth ringed with multiple feelers, 
great claws twitching with lust to 
kill. 

The derrai held himself to calm- 
ness, but it was not easy. The 
klemnil was the bane of his race, a 
horror from out of the misty past. A 
cave dweller, it came out only at 
night to seek its victims. The feelers 
that ringed its jaws picked up 
mind-casts. It would head uner- 
ringly toward the strongest source, 
nor could it be misled. The brain in 
that domed skull knew no common 
lusts. The blood and flesh that fed 
its body were only incidental to its 
true hunger; fear, agony, and hate 
were the nourishment required of its 
hideous soul. 

The derrai projected a calm that 
he did not truly feel. Sweat beaded 
his brow as the klemnil advanced. 
Stumpy legs carried it forward, its 
head weaving on its sinuous neck. 
He projected peace and love, the 
warm community of family and 
clan. 

Its approach was slower now, 
tendrils writhing uneasily. The Der- 
rai’s thoughts strenghtened, happy 
laughter and children playing in the 
sunlight. In his mind a boy and girl 
walked hand in hand through a park 
where shy animals played. 

The klemnil recoiled, seeking 
darkness. He projected bright sun- 
light and happiness. 

It whimpered, the first sound it 
had made since entering the arena. 
It screamed its hate, trumpeting 
death and fear to the world. Derrai 



sent friendship and trust. Its 
screams died away to a moan of 
agony. It clawed blindly at the 
sand, seeking cool darkness, a place 
to skulk and hide. 

Joy and laughter! Triumph of 
light! 

The klemnil howled its torment 
and ran from derrai. It reared its 
full length up the stadium wall, 
clawing at the unyielding barrier. 
Fangs caught at the insulating web- 
bing, and a section pulled free! 
Now the surging emotions of the 
crowd broke through, battering the 
creature with their strength. Torn by 
emotion beyond its capacity to ab- 
sorb the klemnil writhed blindly and 
fell to the sand. 

The beast was dragged away by 
clanking machines even as the vic- 
tor was escorted from the stadium 
in triumph. No other contestant, he 
was sure, would make a better 
showing. The prize would be his, 
and the honor. For a mere sergeant 
in the space-fleet his victory was a 
heady one. His talent was rare and 
valuable out where strange' animals 
and stranger peoples were to be 
found .

soul in the Great Crusade — of the

by the finest writers of science fiction; such sf lumin- 
aries as Isaac Asimov, Joe Haldeman, Ursula K. Le Guin 
(her Nebula winning "The Day Before the Revolution"), 
Frederik Pohl, R.A. Lafferty, Robert Sheckley and 
many more are represented here with their finest works.

DIRECTIONS 

Dear Jim: 

Regarding Fred Pohl’s article “A Short 
Term Solution” in the April issue of Galaxy. 

I enjoy all of Fred’s writing, both in articles 
like this and the science fiction stories he 
writes. However, in the problem-solving part 
of this article, attributed to Peter Fong of 
Emory University, I think I can demonstrate, 
with a few simple illustrations, that this par- 
ticular way will not work. I realize that it is 
easy to criticize, and very hard to come up 
with new ideas, and I might add, I wish his 
solution would work. 

First, without re-stating too much of his 
article, was the use of forty-acre farms for a 
million and one half hard core unemployed, 
to grow com, which in turn was to be made 
into grain alcohol, food and oil. The alcohol 
to be used as fuel supplement. It was stated 
that this would produce an income of approx- 
imately $12,000 per family. 

Now, regardless of how good a theory 
may sound, if it is based on wrong informa- 
tion, then any results worked out, using this 
theory, are likely to be wrong also. Here 
then are the wrong assumptions in the 
theory: 

1. Forty acres of average farm land in the 
non-inigated areas will only produce approx- 
imately 100 bushels of com per acre, or a to- 
tal of 4,000 bushels of com. I Just checked 
the Wall Street Journal and find the price of 
com to be $2.80 per bushel, or a total of 
$11,200. Of course, the yield and price 
would vary from different areas and the price 
varies each year, depending on the supply. 
This does not vary too much from Fred’s 
statements. 

2. The above figures were made, though. 



from the entire forty acres, leaving nothing 
for gardens, buildings, etc., and presumably 
means using the same land year after year to 
grow com only. This simply cannot be done. 
Even adding tremendous amounts of chemi- 
cal fertilizer the yield will go down annually 
until eventually it would be less than 
twenty-five bushels per acre. As any good 
farmer knows, you cannot grow one crop on 
a tract of land for more than two or three 
years without some kind of rotation with a 
legume or green manure crop to be plowed 
under (alfalfa, clover, cowpeas, etc.) to keep 
the fertility up to normal. Most farmers use a 
cattle and pasture, hay or legume and a row 
crop (com, etc.) in rotation, with never more 
than fifty percent of the land in row crop at 
any given time, and any fertilizer is rather 
expensive today. 

3. Nothing is said about tools for these 
farmers. Go out and price tractors, plows, 
cultivating equipment, and you will see it 
takes a small fortune to even get started 
farming today. And to Justify that expense, 
you have to have far more land per farm to 
simply break even. This is why most of the 
small farms have been sold to form much 
larger ones. Simple economics. No profit, no 
farms. 

4. The final part of the theory that is 
wrong is that very few of the hard-core- 
unemployed know anything about farming, 
nor is this something that can be learned in a 
few class sessions. Farmers, of necessity, 
have to be knowledgable in good farming 
practices, hard working, thrifty and have a 
pretty good ability to plan their work months 
ahead. This still does not allow for drouths, 
plant pests and generally poor growing con- 
ditions that affect all farmers each year. 

This still does not mean that all of the idea 
is bad. Although it would not use the un- 
employed to accomplish it, I would suggest 
an alternate plan of inducing all present farm- 
ers to increase their com acreage to ten to 
twenty acres per farm, with a government 
guarateed market for their com to be used in 
the making of alcohol. This would achieve 
part of the plan, and there may be many 
more ways of doing it that as yet simply 



156 




needs to be worked out. We all know that 
this country and the whole world can use all 
the best brains available to overcome the 
problems we face, many of which Fred cov- 
ered in his articles. Maybe other readers 
will have new ideas to add to this. 

Best wishes, 
Sincerely, 
Ed Woods

Fred’s reply: 

Dear Jim: 

Reader Woods makes a couple of good 
points, but he also makes a couple of as- 
sumptions. First, he assumes chemical fer- 
tilizer; that’t not what Fong (or I) had in 
mind at all; the farms should be fertilized by 
that sovereign replenisher of soil, city sew- 
age. In. fact, that’s the whole point. And if 
you’re going to pipe sewage from 
Washington or New York, you might as well 
pipe the water that carries it, too, which pro- 
vides irrigation. 

The second assumption (which is not cov- 
ered in the essay) is that conventional 
energy-intensive farming is involved. It takes 
fuel to run tractors; in fact, it takes fuel to 
make tractors — something of the order of 
50,000 kwh to manufacture each one. For a 
forty-acre farm, or even one two or three 
times that size, there is a .splendid prime 
mover available in the shape of the horse. 

Where Woods is absolutely right is in say- 
ing that farming is not something you pick 
up in an afternoon. (I’ve cleared enough 
brush and picked a sufficient number of 
potato bugs off the vine to appreciate the 
skills involved.) I am not sure how serious 
this problem is. The ghettoized urban poor, 
mostly blacks from the Old South and His- 
panics from Puerto Rico, Mexico or 
elsewhere (depending on which urban area 
you’re talking about) do in fact come to the 
cities in the first place because they can’t 
survive on exactly the same sort of farms 
Fong is proposing, but the reason is not that 
they are unskilled, only that they don’t own 



the land and are thrown out of work by 
mechanization. Does any of that skill survive 
in the year 1975? I don’t know. Obviously 
there are hundreds of thousands of young 
people who are second- or third-generation 
city dwellers, but equally obvious there are 
large numbers who grew up on such farms 
and worked them. There is a reservoir there 
of exactly the skills that are needed. How 
large it is we won’t know until someone 
starts taking the idea seriously. 

Which I hope will be soon! 

Bests, 
Fred Pohl 

Dear Mr. Baen; 

I have noticed recently that Galaxy has 
been including some very good stories, with 
good effects — reminiscent of Edgar Allen 
Poe. 

Poe believed that a short stoiy should be 
written to cause one, and only one, emo- 
tional reaction. Some of your shorter pieces 
in the April 75 issue have reflected just this. 

In example, “Elmo’s Box’’. I gave it a 
quick reading and then reread it. It gives the 
reader something to think about when mess- 
ing around in alternate universes. Although 
it may not explore all of the possibilities (af- 
ter all, they are infinite!), they were food for 
thought. And that is what a short story, 
about a subject and not really telling a full 
story, should do. 

The same. “A Game of Blood And Dust” 
gives one something to think about. 

“Cheap Thrills”, possible and frighten- 
ing future and one way of escaping it. 

“Dea Ex Machina”. On a much larger 
scale, and with a bit more plot, “Day of the 
Gringo”. 

You see, all of these short stories told 
rather simple tales, with simple plots and 
simple climaxes. But they all made the 
readpr thinkl And that is why your magazine 
is considered thought-provoking and fascinat- 
ing. 

Please keep it that way.

Jim, 

Galaxy’s been very good the past couple 
months, but it just isn’t If. Please, please, 
please bring If back. On onionskin with 
cardboard covers, or charge a dollar, or a 
dollar fifty, or, wait — how about microfilm? 
Anything, but please bring If as soon as pos- 
sible. I really like Jerry’s column, but 1 pre- 
fer him to cover subjects such as memory, 
or — sigh — black holes. His article on Vel- 
ikovsky was good, but it wasn’t as mind- 
boggling as the black hole articles. 1 mean, 
what do a few planets tossed around matter 
when you could be talking about universes? I 
also really tike Geis’s bi-monthly, but I’d 
prefer it monthly. Keep up the good work, 
and please bring back If.

Would if / could. 

Dear Mr. Baen, 

I am, 1 suppose, one of your younger 
readers, being only 17, and 1 have only been 
a subscriber to your magazinefs?) for about a 
year. Being an avid collector, however, I 
have bought up back issues for about the last 
ten years. All this gives me a fresh (I hope) 
viewpoint, and if 1 may, 1 would like to 
make a few suggestions. 

To a casual reader, one who picks 
magazines off the shelves occasionally, the 
packaging is what sells the magazine. (Obvi- 
ously, if a magazine is filled with Known 
Authors and the others aren’t, it will sell, but 
for the average mag, it’s the packaging that 
sells.) In my opinion Mr. Jacobsen fell down 
in this department. This is not to say that he 
was a bad editor; anyone who can reel in A 
Time of Changes, Rendezvous With Rama, 
and The Gods Themselves isn’t a bad editor 
by any definition. However the outward ap- 
pearances of the magazine suffered. The 
cover design, until late in his editorship (?) 
was shoddy, and the artwork was poor. This 
last was due, I think, to an overworked Jack 
Gaughan. He can do excellent work, but 
largely didn’t. For an extreme example of 



this, look at the frontpiece to the Cap Ken- 
nedy novel (yes, I know it’s a juvenile) A 
World Aflame. Anyone in a High School Art 
1 class can draw better than that. On the 
other hand, his cover to The Indian Giver (in 
that other magazine) was superb. Get him to 
draw like that all the time and I’ll be happy. 

I think Wendy Pini is also terrific, as are 
most of the rest of the regular crew. 

Another thing to avoid is the use on the 
cover of such descriptions as “Powerful New 
Novelettes,” “Barrier-smashing Stories,” 
“Gripping New ...” “Big New. ,” 
and above all else, ! ! ! ! ! exclamation 
marks. Far from attracting a prospective 
reader, these will cause him to turn away in 
disgust. So far you’ve avoided the descrip- 
tions, but the exclamation points still creep 
in, and 1 honestly believe they stink. 

On the inside you’ve made many changes 
for the good, especially that ugly title page 
of Jacobson’s. There are still a few things 
which would, I think improve the looks still 
more. First, I would like to see the name 
(the full name) of the artist for each story. 
It’s their work, and they should receive cre- 
dit for it. Second, get a new design for the 
SF calendar; the present one is a pretty sad 
drawing. Definitely the science column 
should be kept up; 1 read Dr. Poumelle’s ar- 
ticles first when the magazine comes. What- 
ever happened to the books section, get it 
going again, for it is a must. A brief, or 
even not-so-brief things-to-come column 
would be great, and something like Analog’s 
Analytical Laboratory also, so the readers 
can indicate their preferences. 

I have but one complaint on your stories, 
and that concerns Craig Strete. Maybe it’s 
just me, but 1 simply can’t stand his stories. 
They are pointless, dull and I find it a real 
chore to plow through them. I keep hoping 
he’ll improve, but he hasn’t yet. 

And finally, to the physical package itself. 
1 find the stiff covers are much superior to 
the old slick ones. They hold up much better 
BUT; even quarter-inch steel can’t protect a 
magazine unless it’s packaged. The US mail 
is not known for its gentleness, and many 
things get damaged. Just a week ago I wrote
