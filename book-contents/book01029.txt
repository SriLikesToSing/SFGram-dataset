fAAHS BAIT 



A perennial theme in science 
fiction — and one I wish 
were less hardy — is the explor- 
ation of invasion techniques. 
Here, copyright 1955 by Time, 
Inc., and reprinted by permission, 
is a nastily inventive one: 

“The female screw worm, a 
serious warm-country cattle pest, 
mates only once. Dr. A. W. Lind- 
quist of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture told a Tampa meet- 
ing of entomologists how this de- 
termined monogamy may be the 
screw worm’s undoing. 

“The adult females, which are 
ordinary-looking flies, lay eggs on 
wounds or scratches in the hide 
of cattle; the larvae that hatch 
burrow into the flesh, sometimes 
eating the poor beasts alive. 
Since screw worms breed in wild 
animals as well as in tame ones, 
they are almost immune to ex- 
termination. 

“After pondering the problem, 
Entomologist E. F. Knipling, U.S. 
D.A., had an idea. The male flies, 
he mused, hunt and catch the fe- 
males with singleminded enthusi- 
asm. Why not draft the males 
into the extermination service? 

“So Knipling and his assistants 
raised screw worm flies and ex- 
posed them to X-rays. The flies 
suffered no obvious ill effects and 
were as successful as unexposed 

4 



males in the pursuit of females. 
The difference was that the X- 
rayed males were sterile. This 
meant that every female with 
which one of them mated would 
lay infertile eggs for the rest of 
her life. 

“So Knipling’s Machiavellian 
scheme was given a preliminary 
tryout in Florida with good re- 
sults. Then last year an entomo- 
logical task force invaded the 
Dutch island of Curacao in the 
Caribbean, where screw worms 
were strongly in possession. Sup- 
plied by air with male flies raised 
in Florida (on blood and horse 
meat) and sterilized by gamma 
rays from Cobalt 60, the experi- 
menters released them on the 
island at the rate of 400 males 
a week for each square mile. 

“Results came quickly. Wound- 
ed goats exposed to the flies 
showed clusters of screw worm 
eggs, but many proved infertile. 
The females that laid the eggs 
had mated with sterilized males 
from Florida. After seven weeks, 
all eggs were infertile, and the 
screw worm population dropped 
toward the vanishing point. No 
eggs at all were collected after 
mid-October, and since Novem- 
ber there have been no signs of 
screw worms on the island.

MATRIX THE STRATEGY GAME 



BASED ON THE NEW THEORY OF GAMES 



The Theory of Games is in the news! It has been revealed that top-level government 
planners use the Theory of Games to formulate basic policy. Economists find the Theory 
of Games an invaluable new tool. All branches of the military have revised their logis- 
tic and strategic concepts in the light of this new Theory. Workers in all branches of 
Science find that the Theory of Games provides new avenues of approach to unsolved 
problems and places new interpretations on existing data. 

MATRIX, a simple and interesting game based on the Theory of Games, trains you 
to think subconsciously in the new logic of this Theory. 

Two MATRIX players take turns placing their numbered markers. They could assem- 
ble a matrix that looks like the figure illustrated. 

The player who placed the Black tiles selects 
a horizontal row on his indicator; the player 
who placed the white tiles selects a vertical 
column on his indicator. On the first play of 
this particular matrix, both players simultane- 
ously reveal their indicators set as shown. 

WHITE scores 5 points. If you were BLACK, 
in what proportion should you destribute your 
choices among the rows A B C D to be sure 
of winning this particular game over a series of 
plays regardless of what WHITE may do? 

After you have played several games of 
MATRIX by guesswork alone, you begin in- 
tuitively to solve problems such as the one 
illustrated above. Though MATRIX is a simple 
enough game for a child to play, a new fac- 
tor rapidly becomes apparent. MATRIX is 
unique! In chess or checkers you plan your 
next move only after your opponent has made 
his move. In MATRIX, because both players 
reveal their choices simultaneously, you must 
think from two points of view at the same time! 

The new multi-valued logic inherent in the 
Theory of Games becomes a new thought 
habit as you use it in the concrete situations 
MATRIX provides. This fascinating game is 
a training aid to reach a higher order of 
thinking! 

MATRIX, the strategy game, based on the Theory of Games includes a handsome 
8x8 board, 16 gold-stamped plastic markers, two indicators, score pad, pencil, and a 
24 page booklet. The first two pages of the booklet tell you how to play MATRIX. 
Then the booklet explains some of the basic concepts of the Theory of Games. It 
shows you how to arrive at an arithmetical approximation to the solution of a matrix 
problem such as the' one above. In addition it gives examples of the application of the 
Theory of Games to conflict situations in marketing and military strategy.

MATRIX is an enjoyable 
game. It teaches fascinat- 
ing new thought processes 
as it entertains. In the 
past only those with a 
knowledge of advanced 
mathematics have under- 
stood this method of sta- 
tistical inference. Now, 
with MATRIX, you too 
can add this valuable new 
tool to your powers of 
analysis.

PART 1 OF A 4-PART SERIAL 



T he liner from Port 
Lyautey was comfortable 
and slick, but I was lean- 
ing forward in my seat as we 
came in over Naples. I had been 
on edge all the way across the 
Atlantic. Now as the steward 
came through the compartments 
to pick up our Blue Plate ration 



coupons for the trip, I couldn’t 
help feeling annoyed that I 
hadn’t eaten the food they repre- 
sented. For the Company wanted 
everyone to get the fullest possi- 
ble benefit out of his policies — 
not only the food policies, but 
Blue Blanket, Blue Bolt and all 
the others.

PREFERRED 

RISK 



By EDSON McCANN 

Winner of the $6,500 Galaxy-Simon & Schuster novel contest, 
this taut suspense story asks the challenging question: how 
dangerous would it be to live in a rigidly risk-tree world? 



Illustrated by KOSSIN 




PREFERRED RISK

We whooshed in to a landing 
at Carmody Field, just outside of 
Naples. My baggage was checked 
through, so I didn’t expect to 
have any difficulty clearing past 
the truce-team Customs inspec- 
tors. It was only a matter of 
turning over my baggage checks, 
and boarding the rapido that 
would take me into Naples. 

But my luck was low. The man 
before me was a fussbudget who 
insisted on carrying his own bags, 
and I had to stand behind him a 
quarter of an hour, while the 
truce-teams geigered his socks 
and pajamas. 

While I fidgeted, though, I no- 
ticed that the Customs shed had, 
high up on one wall, a heroic- 
sized bust of Millen Carmody 
himself. Just standing there, un- 
der that benevolent smile, made 
me feel better. I even managed to 
nod politely to the traveler ahead 
of me as he finally got through 
the gate and let me step up to 
the uniformed Company expe- 
diter who checked my baggage 
tickets. 

And the expediter gave me an 
unexpected thrill. He leafed 
through my papers, then stepped 
back and gave me a sharp mili- 
tary salute. “Proceed, Adjuster 
Wills,” he said, returning my 
travel orders. It hadn’t been like 
that at the transfer point at Port 
Lyautey — not even back at the 

8 



Home Office in New York. But 
here we were in Naples, and the 
little war was not yet forgotten; 
we were under Company law, and 
I was an officer of the Company. 

It was all I needed to restore 
my tranquility. But it didn’t last. 

f I ^HE rapido took us through 
lovely Italian countryside, 
but it was in no hurry to do it. 
We were late getting into the 
city itself, and I found myself al- 
most trotting out of the little 
train and up into the main wait- 
ing room where my driver would 
be standing at the Company desk. 

I couldn’t really blame the 
Neapolitans for the delay — it 
wasn’t their fault that the Sicili- 
ans had atomized the main pas- 
senger field at Capodichino dur- 
ing the war, and the rapido wasn’t 
geared to handling that volume 
of traffic from Carmody Field. 
But Mr. Gogarty would be wait- 
ing for me, and it wasn’t my busi- 
ness to keep a Regional Director 
waiting. 

I got as far as the exit to the 
train shed. There was a sudden 
high, shrill blast of whistles and 
a scurrying and, out of the con- 
fusion of persons milling about, 
there suddenly emerged order. 

At every doorway stood three 
uniformed Company expediters; 
squads of expediters formed al- 
most before my eyes all over the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



train shed; single expediters ap- 
peared and took up guard posi- 
tions at every stairwell and plat- 
form head. It was a triumph of 
organization; in no more than 
ten seconds, a confused crowd 
was brought under instant con- 
trol. 

But why? 

There was a babble of sur- 
» prised sounds from the hurrying 
crowds; they were as astonished 
as I. It was reasonable enough 
that the Company’s expediter 
command should conduct this 
sort of surprise raid from time 
to time, of course. The Company 
owed it to its policyholders; by 
insuring them against the haz- 
ards of war under the Blue Bolt 
complex of plans, it had taken 
on the responsibility of prevent- 
ing war when it could. And ordi- 
narily it could, easily enough. 

How could men fight a war 
without weapons — and how 
could they buy weapons, particu- 
larly atomic weapons, when the 
Company owned all the sources 
and sold only to whom it pleased, 
when it pleased, as it pleased? 
There were still occasional out- 
I breaks — witness the recent 
strife between Sicily and Naples 
itself — but the principle re- 
mained. Anyway, surprise raids 
were well within the Company’s 
rights. 

I was mystified, though — I 



could not imagine what they were 
looking for here in the Naples 
railroad terminal; with geigering 
at Carmody Field and every 
other entry point to the Princi- 
pality of Naples, they should 
have caught every fissionable 
atom coming in, and it simply 
did not seem reasonable that any- 
one in the principality itself 
could produce nuclear fuel to 
make a bomb. 

Unless they were not looking 
for bombs, but for people who 
might want to use them. But that 
didn’t tie in with what I had 
been taught as a cadet at the 
Home Office. 

f I ■'HERE was a crackle and an 
A unrecognizable roar from the 
station’s public-address system. 
Then the crowd noises died down 
as people strained to listen, and 
I began to understand the words: 
“. Where you are in an orderly 
fashion until this investigation is 
concluded. You will not be de- 
layed more than a few minutes. 
Do not, repeat, do not attempt 
to leave until this man has been 
captured. Attention! Attention! 
All persons in this area! Under 
Company law, you are ordered 
to stop all activities and stand 
still at once. An investigation is 
being carried out in this build- 
ing. All persons will stand still 
and remain where you are in an 



PREFERRED RISK

orderly fashion until this investi- 
gation . 

The mounting babble drowned 
the speaker out again, but I had 
heard enough. 

I suppose I was wrong, but I 
had been taught that my duty 
was to serve the world, by serv- 
ing the Company, in all ways at 
all times. I walked briskly toward 
the nearest squad of expediters, 
who were already breaking up 
into detachments and moving 
about among the halted knots of 
civilians, peering at faces, asking 
questions. 

I didn’t quite make it; I hadn’t 
gone more than five yards when 
a heavy hand fell on my shoulder, 
and a harsh voice snarled in the 
Neapolitan dialect, “Halt, you! 
Didn’t you hear the orders?” 

I spun, staggering slightly, to 
face an armed expediter-officer. 
I stood at attention and said 
crisply, “Sorry. I’m Thomas Wills, 
Claims Adjuster. I thought I 
might be able to help.” 

The officer stared at me for a 
moment. His cheeks moved; I 
had the impression that, under 
other circumstances, he would 
have spat on the floor at my feet. 
“Papers!” he ordered. 

I passed him my travel orders. 
He looked them over briefly, then 
returned them. Like the Customs 
expediter at Carmody Field, he 
gave me a snap salute, militarily 

10 



precise and, in a way I could 
not quite define, contemptuous. 
“You should just stay here. Ad- 
juster Wills,” he advised — in a 
tone that made it a command. 
“This will be over in a moment.” 
He was gone, back to his post. 
I stood for a moment, but it was 
easier to listen to his orders than 
to obey them; the Neapolitan 
crowd didn’t seem to take too 
well to discipline, and though 
there was no overt resistance to 
the search squads, there was a 
sort of Brownian movement of 
individuals in the throng that 
kept edging me back and away 
from where I had been standing. 
It made me a little uncomfort- 
able; I was standing close to the 
edge of a platform, and a large 
poster announced that the Milan 
Express was due to arrive on that 
track at any moment. In fact, I 
could hear the thin, effeminate 
whistle of its Diesel locomotive 
just beyond the end of the plat- 
form. I tried to inch my way 
from the edge. I dodged around 
an electric baggage-cart, and trod 
heavily on someone’s foot. 

XCUSE me,” I said quick- 
ly, looking at the man. He 
glared back at me. There was a 
bright spark in his eyes; I could 
tell little about his expression be- 
cause, oddly enough in that coun- 
try of clean-shaven faces, he wore 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a heavy, ragged, clipped beard. 
He wore the uniform of a porter. 
He mumbled something I could 
not quite catch, and moved as if 
to push me away. I suppose I put 
up my arm. My papers, with the 
Company seal bright gold upon 
them, were still in my hand, and 
the bearded man caught sight of 
them. 

If there had been anger in his 
eyes before, there was now rag- 
ing fury. He shrilled, “Beast! Ani- 
mal!” He thrust at me blindly 
and leaped past me, out of the 
shelter of the bags; he went spin- 
ning furiously through the crowd, 
men and women ricocheting off 
him. 

I heard a harsh bellow; “There 
he goes! Zorchi! Zorchi!” And I 
could hear the bearded man 
shrieking curses as he hurtled up 
the platform, up toward the on- 
coming train, over to the edge — 
and off the platform to the tracks! 

He fell less than a yard in 
front of the slim nose of the 
Diesel. I don’t sqppose the speed 
of the train was even five miles 
an hour, but the engineer hadn’t 
a chance in the world to stop. 

While I watched, struck mo- 
tionless, along with all the others 
on that platform, the engine 
passed over the huddled form. 
The brakes were shrieking, but 
it was much, much too late. Even 
in that moment I thought he 



would not be killed — not in- 
stantly, at least, unless he died 
of loss of blood. The trunk of 
his body was safely in the well 
between the tracks. But his legs 
were sprawled over a rail. And 
the slow click-click of the wheels 
didn’t stop until his uniformed 
body was far out of sight. 

It was shocking, sickening, un- 
believable. 

And it didn’t stop there. A 
strange thing happened. When 
the man had dived into the path 
of the train, there was a sudden 
fearful hush; it had happened too 
suddenly for anyone to cry out. 
And when the hush ended, there 
was only a momentary, instinc- 
tive gasp of horror. Then there 
was a quick, astonished babble of 
voices — and then cheers! And 
applause, and ringing bravos! 

I didn’t understand. 

The man had thrown himself 
deliberately under the train. I 
was sure of it. 

Was that something to cheer? 

1 finally made it to where the 
Regional Director was wait- 
ing for me — nearly an hour late. 

It was at a hotel overlooking 
the Bay, and the sight was thrill- 
ing enough to put the unpleasant 
accident I had seen out of my 
mind for a moment. There was 
nothing s6 beautiful in all the 
world, I thought, as the Bay of

Naples at sunset. It was not only 
my own opinion; I had seen it 
described many times in the 
travel folders I had pored over, 
while my wife indulgently looked 
over my shoulder, back in those 
remote days of marriage. “La 
prima vista del mundo,” the fold- 
ers had called it — the most 
beautiful sight of the world. They 
had said: “See Naples, and die.” 

I hadn’t known, of course, that 
Marianna would die first. 

But that was all behind me. 
After Marianna’s death, a lot of 
things had happened, all in a 
short time, and some of them 
very bad. But good or bad, I had 
laid down a law for myself: I 
would not dwell on them. I had 
started on a new life, and I was 
going to put the past in a locked 
compartment in my mind. I had 
to! 

I was no longer an ordinary 
civilian, scraping together his 
Blue Heaven premiums for the 
sake of a roof over his head, budg- 
eting his food policies, carrying 
on his humdrum little job. I was 
a servant of the human race and 
a member of the last surviving 
group of gentleman-adventurers 
in all the world: I was an Insur- 
ance Claims Adjuster for the 
Company! 

All the same, I couldn’t quite 
forget some of the bad things that 
had happened, as I walked into 

12 



the hotel dining room to meet the 
Regional Director. 

13EGIONAL Director Gogarty 
■*-*- was a huge, pale balloon of a 
man. He was waiting for me at 
a table set for four. As he greeted 
me, his expression was sour. 
“Glad to meet you. Wills. Bad 
business, this. Bad business. He 
got away with it again.” 

I coughed. “Sir?” I asked. 
“Zorchi!” he snapped. And I 
remembered the name I had 
heard on the platform. The mad- 
man! “Zorchi, Luigi Zorchi, the 
human jellyfish. Wills, do you 
know that that man has just 
cashed in on his twelfth disability 
policy? And not a thing we could 
do to stop him! You were there. 
You saw it, didn’t you?” 

“Well, yes, but — ” 

“Thought so. The twelfth! And 
your driver said on the phone it 
was both legs this time. Both legs 
— and on a common carrier. 
Double indemnity!” He shook his 
enormous head. “And with a 
whole corps of expediters stand- 
ing by to stop him!” 

I said with some difficulty, “Sir, 
do you mean that the man I saw 
run over by the train was — ” 
“Luigi Zorchi. That’s who he 
was. Ever hear of him. Wills?” 
“Can’t say I have.” 

Gogarty nodded his balloon- 
like head. “The Company has 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



kept it out of the papers, of 
course, but you can’t keep any- 
thing from being gossiped about 
around here. This Zorchi is prac- 
tically a national hero in Naples. 
He’s damn near a millionaire by 
now, I guess, and every lira of it 
has come right out of the Com- 
pany’s indemnity funds. And do 
you think we can do anything 
about it? Not a thing! Not even 
when we’re tipped off ahead of 
time — when, what, and where! 

“He just laughs at us. I know 
for a fact,” Gogarty said bitterly, 
“that Zorchi knew we found out 
he was going to dive in front of 
that express tonight. He was just 
daring us to stop him. We should 
have! We should have figured he 
might disguise himself as a por- 
ter. We should — ” 

I interrupted, “Mr. Gogarty, 
are you trying to tell me this 
man deliberately maims himself 
for the accident insurance?” Go- 
garty nodded sourly. “Good heav- 
ens,” I cried, “that’s disloyal!” 

Gogarty laughed sharply and 
brought me up standing. There 
was a note to the way he laughed 
that I didn’t like; for a moment 
there, I thought he was thinking 
of my own little — well, indis- 
cretion. But he said only, “It’s 
expensive, too.” I suppose he 
meant nothing by it. But I was 
sensitive on the subject. 

Before I could ask him any 



more questions, the massive face 
smoothed out in a smile. He rose 
ponderously, greeting someone. 
“Here they are. Wills,” he said 
jovially. “The girls!” 

T he headwaiter was conduct- 
ing two young ladies toward 
us. I remembered my manners 
and stood up, but I confess I was 
surprised. I had heard that disci- 
pline in the field wasn’t the same 
as at the Home Office, but after 
all — Gogarty was a Regional 
Director! 

It was a little informal of him 
to arrange our first meeting at 
dinner, in the first place. But to 
make a social occasion of it was 
— in the straitlaced terms of the 
Home Office where I had been 
trained — almost unthinkable. 

And it was apparent that the 
girls were mere decoration. I had 
a hundred eager questions to ask 
Gogarty — about this mad Zorchi, 
about my duties, about Company 
policy here in the principality of 
Naples — but it would be far 
out of line to bring up Company 
matters with these females pres- 
ent. I was not pleased, but I man- 
aged to be civil. 

The girls were decorative 
enough, I had to admit. 

Gogarty said expansively, all 
trace of ill humor gone, “This is 
Signorina dell’Angela and Miss 
Susan Manchester. Rena and

13 



Susan, this is Tom Wills.” 

I said stiffly, “Delighted.” 

Susan was the blonde one, a 
small plump girl with the bubbly 
smile of a professional model. 
She greeted Gogarty affection- 
ately. The other was dark and 
lovely, but with a constant shad- 
ow, almost glowering, in her eyes. 

So we had a few drinks. Then 
we had a few more. Then the 
captain appeared with a broad 
menu, and I found myself in an 
embarrassing position. For Go- 
garty waved the menu aside with 
a gesture of mock disgust. “Save 
it for the peasants,” he ordered. 
“We don’t want that Blue Plate 
slop. We’ll start with those little 
baby shrimps like I had last 
night, and then an antipasto and 
after that — ” 

I broke in apologetically, “Mr. 
Gogarty, I have only a Class-B 
policy.” 

Gogarty blinked at me. 
“What?” 

I cleared my throat. “I have 
only Class-B coverage on my 
Blue Plate policy,” I repeated. 
“I, uh, I never went in much for 
such — ” 

He looked at me incredulously. 
“Boy,” he said, “this is on the 
Company. Now relax and let me 
order. Blue Plate coverage is for 
the peasants; I eat like a human 
being.” 

It shook me a little. Here was 



a Regional Director talking about 
the rations supplied under the 
Company’s Blue Plate coverage 
as “slop.” Oh, I wasn’t naive 
enough to think that no one 
talked that way. There were a 
certain number of malcontents 
anywhere. I’d heard that kind of 
talk, and even worse, once in a 
while from the Class-D near-un- 
insurables, the soreheads with a 
grudge against the world who 
blamed all their troubles on the 
Company and bleated about the 
“good old days.” Mostly they did 
their bleating when it was pre- 
mium time. I’d noticed. 

But I certainly never expected 
it from Gogarty. 

Still — it was his party. And 
he seemed like a pretty nice guy. 
I had to allow him the defects 
of his virtues, I decided. If he 
was less reverent to the Com- 
pany than he should have been, 
at least by the same token he 
was friendly and democratic. He 
had at least twenty years senior- 
ity on me, and back at the Home 
Office a mere Claims Adjuster 
wouldn’t have been at the same 
table with a Regional Director. 

And here he was feeding me 
better than I had ever eaten in 
my life, talking as though we 
were equals, even (I reminded 
myself) seeing to it that we had 
the young ladies to keep us com- 
pany.

W E WERE hours at dinner, 
hours and endless glasses of 
wine, and we talked continually. 
But the conversation never came 
close to official business. 

The girl Rena was comfortable 
to be with, I found. There was 
that deep, eternal sadness in her 
eyes, and every once in a while 
I came up against it in the mid- 
dle of a laugh; but she was soft- 
voiced and pleasant, and unde- 
niably lovely. Marianna had been 
prettier, I thought, but Mari- 
anna’s voice was harsh Midwest 
while Rena’s — 

I stopped myself. 

When we were on our after- 
dinner liqueurs, Rena excused 
herself for a moment and, after a 
few minutes, I spotted her stand- 
ing by a satin-draped window, 
looking wistfully out over a bal- 
cony. Gogarty winked. 

I got up and, a little unsteadily, 
went over to her. “Shall we look 
at this more closely?” I asked 
her. She smiled and we stepped 
outside. 

Again I was looking down on 
the Bay of Naples — a scene 
painted in moonlight this time, 
instead of the orange hues of sun- 
set. It was warm, but the Moon 
was frosty white in the sky. Even 
its muddled reflection in the slag- 
ged waters was grayish white, 
not yellow. There was a pale 
orange halo over the crater of 



Mount Vesuvius, to our left; and 
far down the coast a bluish phos- 
phorescence, over the horizon, 
marked Pompeii. “Beautiful,” I 
said. 

She looked at me strangely. 
All she said was, “Let’s go back 
inside.” 

Gogarty greeted us. “Looking 
at the debris?” he demanded 
jovially. “Not much to see at 
night. Cheer up, Tom. You’ll see 
all the damage you want to see 
over the next few days.” 

I said, “I hope so, sir.” 

Gogarty shook his head reprov- 
ingly. “Not ‘sir,’ Tom. Save that 
for the office. Call me Sam.” He 
beamed. “You want to know 
what it was like here during the 
war? You can ask the girls. They 
were here all through. Especially 
Susan — she was with the Com- 
pany’s branch here, even before 
I took over. Right, Susan?” 
“Right, Sam,” she said obedi- 
ently. 

Gogarty nodded. “Not that 
Rena missed much either, but 
she was out of town when the 
Sicilians came over. Weren’t 
you?” he demanded, curiously in- 
tent. Rena nodded silently. “Na- 
ples sure took a pasting,” Go- 
garty went on. “It was pretty 
tough for a while. Did you know 
that the Sicilians actually made 
a landing right down the coast at 
Pompeii?”

“I saw the radioactivity,” I 
said. 

“That’s right. They got clob- 
bered, all right. Soon’s the barges 
were in, the Neapolitans let them 
have it. But it cost them. The 
Company only allowed them five 
A-bombs each, and they had to 
use two more to knock out Paler- 
mo. And — well, they don’t like 
to tell this on themselves, but one 
of the others was a dud. Probably 
the only dud A-bomb in history, 
I guess.” 

He grinned at Rena. Astonish- 
ingly, Rena smiled back. 

She was, I thought, a girl of 
many astonishing moments; I 
had not thought that she would 
be amused at Gogarty’s heavy- 
handed needling. 

OGARTY went on and on. I 
was interested enough — I 
had followed the Naples-Sicily 
war in the papers and, of course, 
I’d been briefed at the Home 
Office before coming over — but 
the girls seemed to find it pretty 
dull. By the time Gogarty fin- 
ished telling me about the Sicili- 
an attempt to trigger Mt. Vesu- 
vius by dropping an A-bomb 
into its crater, Rena was frankly 
bored and even Susan was yawn- 
ing behind her palm. 

We finally wound up under the 
marquee of the restaurant. Go- 
garty and the blonde politely 

16 



said good night, and disappeared 
into a cab. It was clearly up to 
me to take Rena home. 

I hailed a cab. When I made 
up my new insurance schedule 
at the Home Office before com- 
ing over, I splurged heavily on 
transportation coverage. Perhaps 
I was making up for the luxuries 
of travel that life with Marianna 
hadn’t allowed me. Anyway, I’d 
taken out Class AA policies. And 
as the cab driver clipped my 
coupons he was extremely polite. 

Rena lived a long way from 
the hotel. I tried to make small 
talk, but she seemed to have 
something on her mind. I was in 
the middle of telling her about 
the terrible “accident” I had seen 
that evening at the station — 
suitably censored, of course — 
when I observed she was staring 
out the window. 

She hadn’t been paying atten- 
tion while I talked, but she no- 
ticed the silence when I stopped. 
She gave a little shake of the 
head and looked at me. “I’m 
sorry, Mr. Wills,” she said. “I am 
being rude.” 

“Not at all,” I said gallantly. 

“Yes.” She nodded and smiled, 
but it was a thoughtful, almost a 
sad, smile. “You are too polite, 
you gentlemen of the Company. 
Is that part of your training?” 

“It’s easy to be polite to you, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Miss dell’ Angela,” I said by rote. 
Yes, it was part of our training: 
A Claims Adjuster is always cour- 
teous. But what I said was true 
enough, all the same. She was a 
girl that I enjoyed being polite 
to. 

“No, truly,” she persisted. “You 
are an important officer in the 
Company, and you must have 
trained long for the post. What 
did they teach you?” 

“Well — ” I hesitated — “just 
the sort of thing you’d expect, I 
guess. A little statistical mathe- 
matics — enough so we can un- 
derstand what the actuaries 
mean. Company policies, business 
methods, administration. Then, 
naturally, we had a lot of morale 
sessions. A Claims Adjuster — ” 
I cleared my throat, feeling a 
little self-conscious — “a Claims 
Adjuster is supposed to be like 
Caesar’s wife, you know. He must 
always set an example to his staff 
and to the public. I guess that 
sounds pretty stuffy. I don’t mean 
it to be. But there is a lot of em- 
phasis on tradition and honor and 
discipline.” 

She asked, rather oddly, “And 
is there a course in loyalty?” 

“Why, I suppose you might say 
that. There are ceremonies, you 
know. And it’s a matter of cadet 
honor to put the Company ahead 
of personal affairs.” 



a A ND do all Claims Adjusters 
live by this code?” 

For a moment I couldn’t an- 
swer. It was like a blow in the 
face. I turned sharply to look at 
her, but there was no expression 
on her face, only a mild polite 
curiosity. 

I said with difficulty, “Miss 
dell’Angela, what are you getting 
at?” 

“Why, nothing!” Her face was 
as angelic as her name. 

“I don’t know what you mean 
or what you may have heard 
about me. Miss dell’Angela, but 
I can tell you this, if you are in- 
terested. When my wife died, I 
went to pieces. I admit it. I said 
a lot of things I shouldn’t have, 
and some of them may have re- 
flected against the Company. I’m 
not trying to deny that but, you 
understand, I was upset at the 
time. I’m not upset now.” I took 
a deep breath. “To me, the Com- 
pany is the savior of humanity. 
I don’t want to sound like a fan- 
atic, but I am loyal to the Com- 
pany, to the extent of putting it 
ahead of my personal affairs, to 
the extent of doing whatever job 
the Company assigns to me. And, 
if necessary, to the extent of dy- 
ing for it if I have to. Is that 
clear?” 

Well, that was a conversation- 
stopper, of course. I hadn’t meant 



PREFERRED RISK 



17 



to get all wound up about it, but 
it hurt to find out that there had 
been gossip. The dell’Angela girl 
merely said: “Quite clear.” 

We rode in silence for a while. 
She was staring out the window 
again, and I didn’t especially 
want to talk just then. Maybe I 
was too sensitive. But there was 
no doubt in my mind that the 
Company was the white hope of 
the world, and I didn’t like being 
branded a traitor because of what 
I’d said after Marianna died. I 
was, in a way, paying the penalty 
for it — it had been made pretty 
clear to me that I was on proba- 
tion. That was enough. 

As I said, she lived a long way 
from the Gran Reale. I had 
plenty of time for my flare-up, 
and for brooding, and for getting 
over it. 

But we never did get around 
to much idle conversation on that 
little trip. By the time I had sim- 
mered down, I began to have 
disturbing thoughts. It suddenly 
occurred to me that I was a man, 
and she was a girl, and we were 
riding in a cab. 

I don’t know how else to say 
it. At one moment I was taking 
her home from a dinner; and at 
the next, I was taking her home 
from a date. Nothing had 
changed — except the way I 
looked at it. 

18 



A ll of a sudden, I began to 
feel as though I were four- 
teen years old again. It had been 
quite a long time since I had had 
the duty of escorting a beautiful 
girl — and by then I realized 
this was a really beautiful girl — 
home at the end of an evening. 
And I was faced with the ques- 
tion that I had thought would 
never bother me again at least a 
decade before. Should I kiss her 
good night? 

It was a problem, and I 
thought about it, feeling a little 
foolish but rather happy about it. 
But all my thinking came to 
nothing. She decided for me. 

The cab stopped in front of a 
white stucco wall. Like so many 
of the better Italian homes, the 
wall enclosed a garden, and the 
house was in the middle of the 
garden. It was an attractive 
enough place — Class A at least, 
I thought — though it was hard 
to tell in the moonlight. 

I cleared my throat and sort 
of halfway leaned over to her. 

Then she turned and was look- 
ing up at me, and the moonlight 
glinted brightly off what could 
only have been tears in her eyes. 
I stared. 

She didn’t say a word. She 
shook her head briefly, opened 
the door and was gone behind 
the gate. 

It was a puzzlement. Why had 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



she been crying? What had I 
done? 

I reviewed my conduct all the 
way back to the hotel, but noth- 
ing much came of it. Perhaps I 
had been brusque — but brusque 
enough to bring tears? I couldn’t 
believe it. 

Curious new life! I fell asleep 
with the pale moon shining in 
the window, brooding about the 
life I was just beginning, and 
about the old life behind me that 
was buried in the same grave 
with Marianna. 

II 

T he Naples branch of the 
Company lay in the heart of 
the city. I took a cab to a sort of 
dome-roofed thing called a gal- 
leria, and walked under its skele- 
tal steel ceiling to my new office. 
Once the galleria had been roofed 
with glass, but the glass had 
powdered down from the concus- 
sion of the Mt. Vesuvius bomb, 
or the Capodichino bomb, or one 
of the other hammerblows the 
Sicilians had rained on the prin- 
cipality of Naples in the recent 
unpleasantness. 

I entered the office and looked 
around. The blonde girl named 
Susan appeared to double as the 
office receptionist. She nodded 
efficiently and waved me to a 
fenced-off enclosure where Sam 



Gogarty sat, plump and un- 
troubled, at an enormous desk. 

I pushed open the swinging 
gate. 

Gogarty looked at me icily. 
“You’re late,” he said. 

He had no hangover, it was 
clear. I said apologetically, 
“Sorry, I’m — ” 

“Never mind. Just don’t let it 
happen again.” It was clear that, 
in the office, business was busi- 
ness; the fact that we had been 
drinking together the night be- 
fore would not condone liberties 
the morning after. Gogarty said, 
“Your desk is over 'there. Wills. 
Better get started.” 

I felt considerably deflated as 
I sat down at my desk and stared 
unhappily at the piles of blue 
and yellow manifolds before me. 

The Company had trained me 
well. I didn’t need to be coached 
in order to get through the work; 
it was all a matter of following 
established techniques and prece- 
dents. I checked the coverage, re- 
duced the claim to tape-code, fed 
the tapes into a machine. 

If the claim was legitimate, the 
machine computed the amounts 
due and issued a punch-card 
check. If there was anything 
wrong, the machine flashed a red 
light and spat the faulty claim 
out into a hopper. 

And there were plenty of 
claims. Every adult in Naples, of 



PREFERRED RISK 



19 



course, carried the conventional 
War-and-Disaster policy — the 
so-called Blue Bolt coverage. 
Since few of them had actually 
been injured in the war, the 
claims were small — mostly for 
cost of premiums on other poli- 
cies, under the disability clauses. 
(For if war prevented a policy- 
holder from meeting his Blue 
Plate premiums, for instance, the 
Company itself under Blue Bolt 
would keep his policies paid — 
and the policyholder fed.) 

But there were some big 
claims, too. The Neapolitan gov- 
ernment had carried the conven- 
tional Blue Bolt policies and, 
though the policy had been can- 
celed by the Company before 
hostilities broke out — thus reliev- 
ing the Company of the neces- 
sity of paying damages to the 
principality of Naples itself — 
still there were all the subsidiary 
loss and damage claims of the 
Neapolitan government’s bur- 
eaus and departments, almost 
every one of them non-canceling. 

It amounted to billions and 
billions of lire. Just looking at 
the amounts on some of the 
vouchers before me made my 
head swim. And the same, of 
course, would be true in Sicily. 
Though that would naturally be 
handled by the Sicilian office, not 
by us. 

However, the cost of this one 



brief, meager little war between 
Naples and Sicily, with less than 
ten thousand casualties, lasting 
hardly more than a week, must 
have set the Company’s reserves 
back hundreds of millions of dol- 
lars. 

And to think that some people 
didn’t like the Company! Why, 
without it, the whole peninsula 
of Italy would have been in fi- 
nancial ruin, the solvent areas 
dragged down with the combat- 
ants! 

Naturally, the Regional Office 
was understaffed for this volume 
of work — which is why they 
had flown in new Adjusters like 
myself. 

I LOOKED up from my desk, 
surprised. Susan was standing 
next to me, an aspirin and a 
paper cup of water in her hand. 
“You look like you might need 
this,” she whispered. She winked 
and was gone. 

I swallowed it gratefully, al- 
though my hangover was almost 
gone. I was finding in these dry 
papers all the romance and ex- 
citement I had joined the Com- 
pany’s foreign service for. Here 
before me were human lives, 
drama, tragedy, even an occa- 
sional touch of human-interest 
comedy. 

For the Company was support- 
ing most of Naples and whatever 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



affected a Neapolitan life showed 
up somehow in the records of the 
Company. 

It was a clean, dedicated feel- 
ing to work for the Company. 
The monks of the Middle Ages 
might have had something of the 
same positive conviction that 
their work in the service of a 
mighty churchly empire was right 
and just, but surely no one since. 

I attacked the mountain of 
forms with determination, taking 
pleasure in the knowledge that 
every one I processed meant one 
life helped by the Company. 

It was plain in history, for all 
to see. Once the world had been 
turbulent and distressed, and the 
Company had smoothed it out. 
It had started with fires and dis- 
ease. When the first primitive 
insurance companies — there 
were more than one, in the early 
days — began offering protection 
against the hazards of fire, they 
had found it wise to try to pre- 
vent fires. There were the adver- 
tising campaigns with their wist- 
ful-eyed bears pleading with 
smokers not to drop their lighted 
cigarettes in the dry forest; the 
technical bureaus like the Under- 
writer’s Laboratory, testing elec- 
trical equipment, devising intri- 
cate and homely gimmicks like 
the underwriter’s knot; the Fire 
Patrol in the big cities that fol- 
lowed up the city-owned Fire De- 



partment; the endless education- 
al sessions in the schools. And 
fires decreased. 

Then there was life insurance. 
Each time a death benefit was 
paid, a digit rang up on the actu- 
arial scoreboard. Was tuberculosis 
a major killer? Establish mo- 
bile chest X-rays; alert the peo- 
ple to the meaning of a chronic 
cough. Was it heart disease? Ex- 
plain the dangers of overweight, 
the idiocy of exercise past forty. 
People lived longer. 

Health insurance followed the 
same pattern. It had begun by 
paying for bills incurred during 
sickness, and ended by provid- 
ing full medical sickness preven- 
tion and treatment for all. Elab- 
orate research programs reduced 
the danger of disease to nearly 
nothing. Only a few rare cases, 
like that of Marianna. 

I shook myself away from the 
thought. Anyway, it was neither 
fire nor health insurance that 
concerned me now, but the Blue 
Bolt anti-war complex of the 
Company’s policies. It was easy 
enough to see how it had come 
about. For with fire and accident 
and disease ameliorated by the 
strong protecting hand of the 
Company, only one major haz- 
ard remained — war. 

And so the Company had log- 
ically and inevitably resolved to 
wipe out war.

1 LOOKED up. It was Susan 
again, this time with a card- 
board container of coffee. 

“You’re an angel,” I said. She 
set the coffee down and turned 
to go. I looked quickly around 
to make sure that Gogarty was 
busy, and stopped her. “Tell me 
something?” 

“Sure.” 

“About this girl, Rena. Does 
she work for the Company?” 
Susan giggled. “Heavens, no. 
What an idea!” 

“What’s so strange about it?” 
She straightened out her face. 
“You’d better ask Sam — Mr. 
Gogarty, that is. Didn’t you have 
a chance to talk to her last night? 
Or were you too busy with other 
things?” 

“I only want to know how she 
happened to be with you.” 

Susan shrugged. “Sam thought 
you’d like to meet her, I guess. 
Really, you’ll have to ask him. 
All I know is that she’s been in 
here quite a lot about some 
claims. But she doesn’t work here, 
believe me.” She wrinkled her 
nose in amusement. “And I won’t 
work here either, if I don’t get 
back to my desk.” 

I took the hint. By lunch time, 
I had got through a good half of 
the accumulation on my desk. I 
ate briefly and not too well at a 
nearby trattoria with a “B” on 
the Blue Plate medallion in its 

22 



window. After the dinner of the 
night before, I more than half 
agreed with Gogarty’s comments 
about the Blue Plate menus. 

Gogarty called me over when 
I got back to the office. He said, 
“I haven’t had a chance to talk 
to you about Luigi Zorchi.” 

I nodded eagerly. I had been 
hoping for some explanations. 

Gogarty went on, “Since you 
were on the scene when he took 
his dive, you might as well fol- 
low up. God knows you can’t do 
worse than the rest of us.” 

I said dubiously, “Well, I saw 
the accident, if that’s what you 
mean.” 

“Accident! What accident? 
This is the twelfth time he’s done 
it, I tell you.” He tossed a file 
folder at me. “Take a look! Loss 
of limbs — four times. Internal 
injuries — six times. Loss of vi- 
sion, impaired hearing, hospitali- 
zation and so on — good lord, I 
can’t count the number of sep- 
arate claims. And, every one, he 
has collected on. Go ahead, look 
it over.” 

I PEERED at the folder. The 
top sheet was a field report on 
the incident I had watched, when 
the locomotive of the Milan ex- 
press had severed both legs. The 
one below it, dated five weeks 
earlier, was for flash burns suf- 
fered in the explosion of a stove, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



causing the loss of the right fore- 
arm nearly to the elbow. 

Curious, I thought, I hadn’t 
noticed anything when I saw the 
man on the platform. Still, I 
hadn’t paid too much attention 
to him at first, and modern pros- 
thetic devices were nearly mirac- 
ulous. I riffled through the red- 
bordered sheets. The fifth claim 
down, nearly two years before, 
was — 

I yelped, “Mr. Gogarty! This 
is a fraud!” 

“What?” 

“Look at this! ‘On 21st Octo- 
ber, the insured suffered severe 
injuries while trapped in a rising 
elevator with faulty safety equip- 
ment, resulting in loss of both 
legs above knees, multiple lacer- 
ations of — ’ Well, never mind 
the rest of it. But look at that, 
Mr. Gogarty! He already lost 
both legs! He can’t lose them 
twice, can he?” 

Gogarty sat back in his chair, 
looking at me oddly. “You 
startled me,” he complained. 
“Wills, what have I been trying 
to tell you? That’s the whole 
point, boy! No, he didn’t lose his 
legs twice. It was five times!” 

I goggled at him. “But — ” 

“But, but. But he did. Wait a 
minute — ” he held up a hand to 
stop my questions — “just take 
a look through the folder. See for 
yourself.” He waited while, in- 



credulously, I finished going 
through the dossier. It was true. 
I looked at Gogarty wordlessly. 

He said resentfully, “You see 
what we’re up against? And none 
of the things you are about to 
say would help. There is no mis- 
take in the records — they’ve 
been double and triple-checked. 
There is no possibility that an- 
other man, or men, substituted 
for Zorchi — fingerprints have 
checked every time. The three 
times he lost his arms, retina- 
prints checked. There is no pos- 
sibility that the doctors were 
bribed, or that he lost a little bit 
more of his leg, for instance, in 
each accident — the severed sec- 
tions were recovered, and they 
were complete. Wills, this guy 
grows new arms and legs like a 
crab!” 

I looked at him in a daze. 
“What a fantastic scientific dis- 
covery!” I said. 

H e snorted. “Fantastic 

pain in the neck! Zorchi 
can’t go on like this; he’ll bank- 
rupt the Company. We can’t stop 
him. Even when we were tipp>ed 
off this time — we couldn’t stop 
him. And I’ll tell you true. Wills, 
that platform was loaded with 
our men when Zorchi made his 
dive. You weren’t the only Ad- 
juster of the Company there.” 

He picked a folded sheet of 



PREFERRED RISK 



33 



paper out of his desk. “Here. 
Zorchi is still in the hospital; no 
visitors allowed today. But I 
want you to take these creden- 
tials and go to see him tomorrow. 
You came to us with a high 
recommendation from the Home 
Office, Wills — ” That made me 
look at him sharply, but his ex- 
pression was innocent “You’re 
supposed to be a man of intelli- 
gence and resourcefulness. See if 
you can come up with some ideas 
on dealing with that situation. I’d 
handle it myself, but I’ve got — ” 
he grimaced — “certain other 
minor administrative difficulties 
to deal with. Oh, nothing impor- 
tant, but you might as well know 
that there appears to be a little, 
well, popular underground resent- 
ment toward the Company 
around here.” 

“Incredible!” I said. 

He looked at me thoughtfully 
for a moment. “Well,” he said, 
“it’s quitting time. See you in the 
morning.” 

I had a lonely dinner at the 
same cheap restaurant where I’d 
had my lunch. I spent an hour in 
my room with my Company-is- 
sued Adjuster’s Handbook, look- 
ing for some precedent that had 
some sort of bearing on the case 
of a man who could grow new 
arms and legs. There wasn’t any- 
thing, of course. I went out for a 
walk . and still it wasn’t nearly 



time for me to retire to bed. 

So I did what I had been 
avoiding doing. I looked in the 
phone book for Rena dell’ Ange- 
la’s number. There was, it devel- 
oped, a Benedetto dell’Angela at 
the address she’d given the cab 
driver; but the phone was dis- 
connected. 

So I wandered around some 
more, and then I went to sleep, 
dreaming about Benedetto dell’ 
Angela. I saw him as a leather- 
faced, white-bearded and courtly 
old gentleman. Rena’s father, 
surely. Possibly even her elder 
brother. Certainly not her hus- 
band. 

It was a dull finish to the first 
full day of my rich, exciting new 
life. 

T he “minor administrative 
difficulties” got major. So I 
didn’t get to see Zorchi the next 
day, after all. 

A Junior Adjuster named 
Hammond — he was easily sixty, 
but the slow-moving, unenter- 
prising type that would stay jun- 
ior till the day he died — came 
white-faced into the office a few 
minutes after opening and hud- 
dled with Gogarty for a quarter 
of an hour. 

Then Gogarty called me over. 
He said, “We’re having a spot of 
trouble. Hammond needs a little 
help; you’re elected. Draw what 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you need, take a couple of ex- 
pediters along, report back to me 
this evening.” 

Hammond and I stopped at 
the cashier’s office to draw three 
dispatch-cases full of lira-notes. 
Outside, an armored car was 
waiting for us, with a full crew 
of six uniformed expediters. We 
raced off down the narrow streets 
with the sirens wailing, climbing 
the long hill road past the radio- 
active remains of Capodichino, 
heading out toward the farm- 
lands. 

Hammond worriedly filled me 
in on the way. He had got in 
early to his branch office that 
morning, but no earlier than the 
first of a long line of policyhold- 
ers. There had, it appeared, been 
some kind of rumor spread that 
the Company was running out of 
money. It was preposterous on 
the face of it — after all, who 
printed the money? — but you 
can’t argue with a large group of 
people and, before the official 
hour of opening the branch, there 
were more than a hundred in the 
knotted line outside the door. 

Hammond had rushed into the 
Naples office for help, leaving his 
staff to do the best they could. 
He said gloomily, staring out 
through the view-slits at the 
farmlands and vineyards we were 
passing through, “I just hope we 
still have a branch office. This is 



a bad spot. Wills. Caserta. It got 
bombed out, you know; the whole 
southern end of the town is radio- 
active. And it has a long history 
of trouble. Used to be the sum- 
mer royal seat of the old Italian 
monarchy; then the Americans 
used it for a command headquar- 
ters in the war Mussolini got into 

— the first atom war. It’s been 
fought over time and again.” 

I said reasonably, “But don’t 
they know the Company has all 
the resources in the world?” 

“Sure they do — when they’re 
thinking. Right now they’re not 
thinking. They’ve got it in their 
heads that the Company isn’t go- 
ing to pay off. They’re scared. 
You can’t tell them anything. 
You can’t even give them checks 

— they want cash on the line.” 

I said, “That’s pretty silly, isn’t 

it? I mean — ugh!” I retched, as 
I suddenly got a whiff of the 
most unpleasant and penetrating 
odor I had ever encountered in 
my life. It was like death and de- 
struction in gaseous form; a sick- 
ly sweet, clinging stink that oozed 
in through the pores of my skin 
to turn my stomach. “Wowl” I 
said, gasping. 

Hammond looked at me in be- 
wilderment; then he grinned 
sourly. “New here, aren’t you?” 
he inquired. “That’s hemp. They 
grow the stuff for the fibers; and 
to get the fibers out, they let it

get good and rotten. You’ll get 
used to it,” he promised. 

I tried. I tried pretty hard to 
get used to it; I hardly heard a 
word he said all the rest of the 
way in to Caserta, I was trying 
so hard. But I didn’t get used to 
it. 

T hen I had my mind taken 
off my troubles. The branch 
was still doing business when we 
got there, though there were 
easily three or four hundred an- 
grily shouting policyholders mill- 
ing around in front of it. They 
scattered before us as the ar- 
mored car came racing in; we 
skidded to a stop, siren blasting, 
and the expediters leaped out 
with their weapons at the ready. 

Hammond and I climbed out 
of the armored car with our bags 
of money. There was an audible 
excitement in the crowd as the 
word spread back that the Com- 
pany had brought in enormous 
stores of lire, more than any man 
had ever seen, to pay off the 
claims. We could hear the chat- 
ter of many voices, and we al- 
most could feel the tension slack 
off. 

It looked like the trouble was 
over. 

Then there was a shrill whistle. 
It sounded very much like the 
alarm whistle of one of our ex- 
pediters but, thinking back, I 

26 



have never been sure. 

Perhaps it was a nervous ex- 
pediter, perhaps it was an agent 
provocateur in the crowd. But, 
whoever pulled the trigger, the 
explosion went off. 

There was a ragged yell from 
the crowd, and rocks began whiz- 
zing through the air. The paci- 
fists in the mob began heading 
for the doorways and alleys 
around; women screamed, men 
shouted and bellowed, and for a 
moment it looked like we would 
be swamped. For not very many 
of them were pacifists, and there 
were at least a hundred scream- 
ing, gesticulating men lunging at 
us. 

One cobblestone shattered the 
theoretically unbreakable wind- 
shield of the truck next to my 
head; then the expediters, gas 
guns spitting, were ringing around 
us to protect the money. 

It was a short fight but vicious. 
By the time the first assault was 
repulsed there were at least fifty 
persons lying motionless in the 
street. 

I had never seen that sort of 
violence before. It did something 
to my stomach. I stood weaving, 
holding to the armored car, while 
the expediters circled the area 
around the branch office, firing 
hurry-up shots at the running 
rioters. Hammond looked at me 
questioningly. 

GALAXY S C I E N C E F I C T I O N 



“That smell,” I said apologeti- 
cally. 

He said only, “Sure.” True, the 
fetid aroma from the hemp fields 
was billowing all around us, but 
he knew as well as I that it was 
not the smell that was bothering 
me. 

In a few moments, as we were 
locking the bags of money into 
the office safe, red-crossed vehi- 
cles bearing the Company insig- 
nia appeared in the street out- 
side, and medics began tending 
to the victims. Each one got a 
shot of something — an antidote 
to the sleep-gas from the expedit- 
ers’ guns, I guessed — and was 
loaded unceremoniously into the 
ambulances. 

Hammond appeared beside 
me. “Ready for business?” he 
asked. “They’ll be back any min- 
ute now, the ones that can still 
walk. We’ll be paying off until 
midnight, the way it looks.” 

I said, “Sure. That — that gas 
doesn’t hurt them any, does it? 
I mean, after they go to the hos- 
pital they’ll be all right, won’t 
they?” 

Hammond, twirling a pencil in 
his fingers, stared broodingly at 
the motionless body of one poli- 
cyholder. He was a well-dressed 
man of fifty or so, with a reddish 
mustache, unusual in that area, 
and shattered rimless glasses. Not 
at all the type I would expect to 



see in a street fight; probably, I 
thought, a typical innocent by- 
stander. 

Hammond said absently, “Oh, 
sure. They’ll be all right. Never 
know what hit them.” There was 
a tiny sharp crack and the two 
halves of the pencil fell to the 
floor. He looked at it in surprise. 
“Come on. Wills. Let’s get to 
work.” 

Ill 

COURSE I still believed 
in the Company. 

But all the same, it was the 
first time since I went to work 
for the Company that I had even 
had to ask myself that question. 

That long, long day in Ham- 
mond’s puny little branch office, 
sweltering in the smell of the 
hemp fields, pushing across the 
mountains of lire to the grim- 
faced policyholders left me a lit- 
tle less sure of things. Nearly all 
of the first hundred or so to pass 
my desk had been in the crowd 
that the expediters had fired on. 
A few had fresh bandages to 
show where stones had missed 
the expediters, but found targets 
all the same. Nearly all of them 
were hostile. There was no casual 
conversation, very few “Grazie^’ 
as they received their payments. 

But at last the day was at an 
end. Hammond snapped an order 



PREFERRED RISK 



27 



to one of the clerks, who shoved 
his way through the dwindling 
line to close the door and bang 
down the shutters. I put through 
the last few applications, and we 
were through. 

It was hot and muggy out in 
the streets of New Caserta. Truce 
teams of expediters were patrol- 
ling the square, taken off their 
regular assignments of enforcing 
the peace between Naples and 
Sicily to keep down Caserta’s 
own mobs. Hammond suggested 
dinner, and we went to a little 
Blue Plate in the palace itself. 

Hammond held Class-A food 
policies, but he was politeness it- 
self; he voluntarily led the way 
to the Class-B area. We presented 
our policy-cards to the waiter for 
canceling, and sat back to enjoy 
the air conditioning. 

I was still troubled over the 
violence. I said, “Has there been 
any trouble around here before?” 

Hammond said ruefully, “Plen- 
ty. All over Europe, if you want 
my opinion. Of course, you never 
see it in the papers, but I’ve 
heard stories from field workers. 
They practically had a revolu- 
tion in the Sudeten strip after 
the Prague-Vienna affair.” He 
stopped talking as the waiter set 
his Meal-of-the-Day in front of 
him. Hammond looked at it sour- 
ly. “Oh, the hell with it, Wills,” 



he said. “Have a drink with me 
to wash this stuff down.” 

W E ORDERED liquor, and 
Hammond shoved his Class- 
A card at the waiter. I am not a 
snoop, but I couldn’t help notic- 
ing that the liquor coupons were 
nearly all gone; at his present 
rate, Hammond would use up his 
year’s allotment by the end of 
the summer, and be paying cash 
for his drinks. 

Dinner was dull. Hammond 
made it dull, because he was 
much more interested in his 
drinking than in me. Though I 
was never much of a drinker, I’d 
had a little experience in watch- 
ing others tank up; Hammond I 
classified as the surly and silent 
type. He wasn’t quite rude to me, 
but after the brandy with his 
coffee, and during the three or 
four straight whiskies that fol- 
lowed that, he hardly spoke to 
me at all. 

We left the Blue Plate in a 
strained silence and, after the 
cooled restaurant, the heat out- 
side was painful. The air was 
absolutely static, and the odor 
from the hemp fields soaked in- 
to our clothes like a bath in a 
sewer. 

Overhead it was nearly dark, 
and there were low black clouds. 
“We’d better get going,” I ven- 
tured. “Looks like rain.” 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Hammond said nothing, only 
grunted. He lurched ahead of me 
toward the narrow street that led 
back to the branch office, where 
our transport was waiting. 

The distance was easily half a 
mile. Now I am not terribly lazy, 
and even in the heat I was will- 
ing enough to walk. But I didn’t 
want to get caught in a rain. 
Maybe it was superstition on my 
part — I knew- that the danger 
was really slight — but I couldn’t 
forget that three separate atomic 
explosions had gone off in the 
area around Caserta and Naples 
within only a few months, and 
there was going to be a certain 
amount of radioactivity in every 
drop of rain that fell for a hun- 
dred miles around. 

I started to tell Hammond 
about it, but he made a disgusted 
noise and stumbled ahead. 

It wasn’t as if we had to walk. 
Caserta was not well equipped 
with cabs, but there were a few; 
and both Hammond and myself 
ranked high enough in the Com- 
pany to have been able to get q 
lift from one of the expediter 
cars that were cruising about. 

There was a flare of lightning 
over the eastern mountains and, 
iff a moment, the pounding roll 
of thunder. And a flat globule of 
rain splattered on my face. 

I said, “Hammond, let’s wait 
here for a lift.” 



Surprisingly he came along 
with me. 

If he hadn’t, I would have left 
him in the street. 

W E WERE in a street of tene- 
ments. It was almost desert- 
ed; I rapped on the nearest door. 
No answer, no sound inside. I 
rapped again, then tried the door. 
It was locked. 

The next door — ancient and 
rickety as the first — was also 
locked, and no one answered. The 
third door, no one answered. By 
then it was raining hard; the knob 
turned under my fingers, and we 
stepped inside. 

We left the door ajar, on the 
chance that a squad car or cab 
might pass, and for light. It was 
almost dark outside, apart from 
the light from the lightning flash- 
es, but even so it was darker 
within. There was no light at all 
in the narrow, odorous hall; not 
even a light seeping imder the 
apartment doors. 

In the lightning flare, Ham- 
mond’s face was pale. He was 
beginning to sober up, and his 
manner was uneasy. 

We were there perhaps half 
an hour in that silent hall, watch- 
ing the rain sleet down and the 
lightning flare and listening to 
the thunder. Two or three times, 
squad cars passed, nosing slowly 
down the drenched streets, but 



PREFERRED RISK 



29 



though Hammond looked long- 
ingly at them, I still didn’t want 
to get wet. 

Then the rain slowed and al- 
most simultaneously a civilian 
cab appeared at the head of the 
block. “Come on,” I said, tugging 
at his arm. 

He balked. “Wait for a squad 
car,” he mumbled. 

“Why? Come on, Hammond, 
it may start to pour again in a 
minute.” 

“No!” 



His behavior was exasperating 
me. Clearly it wasn’t that he 
was too niggardly to pay for the 
cab; it was almost as if he were 
delaying going back to the branch 
office for some hidden reason. 
But that was ridiculous, of course. 

I said, “Look, you can stay 
here if you want to, but I’m go- 
ing.” I jumped out of the door- 
way just in time to flag the cab; 
it rolled to a stop, and the driver 
backed to where I was standing. 
As I got in, I looked once more 




to the doorway where Hammond 
was standing, his face unread- 
able. 

He made a gesture of some 
sort, but the lightning flashed 
again and I skipped into the cab. 
When I looked again he was in- 
visible inside the doorway, and 



“Un momento. Signore ’Am- 
mond!” 

I stared at the man, a rather 
badly dressed Neapolitan. I said 
angrily, “Hammond isn’t here!” 
The man’s expression changed. 
It had been belligerent; it now 
became astonished and apologe- 




I told the driver to take me to 
the branch office of the Company. 

Curious; but it was not an end 
to curious things that night. At 
the branch office, my car was 
waiting to take me back to Na- 
ples. 

I surrendered my travel cou- 
pons to the cab driver and 
jumped from one vehicle to the 
other. 

Before my driver could start, 
someone appeared at the window 
of the car and a sharp voice said. 



tic. “A thousand times excuse 
me,” he said. “The Signore ’Am- 
mond, can you say where he is?” 
I hesitated, but only for a mo- 
ment. I didn’t like the little man 
peering in my window, however 
humble and conciliatory he had 
become. I said abruptly, “No.” 
And my driver took off, leaving 
the man standing there. 

I turned to look back at him 
as we drove off. 

It was ridiculous, but the way 
he was standing as we left, hold-

ing one hand in his pocket, eyes 
narrowed and thoughtful, made 
me think that he was carrying a 
gun. 

But, of course, that was impos- 
sible. The Company didn’t per- 
mit lethal weapons, and who in 
all the world would challenge a 
rule of the Company? 

Vj^HEN I showed up in the 
Naples office the next morn- 
ing, Susan had my coffee ready 
and waiting for me. I said grate- 
fully, “Bless you.” 

She chuckled. “That’s not all,” 
she said. “Here’s something else 
you might like. Just remember 
though, if anyone asks, you got 
it out of the files yourself.” 

She slipped a folder under the 
piles of forms on my desk and 
disappeared. I peered at it curi- 
ously. It was labeled; “Policy 
BNT-3KT-890776, Blue Bolt 
Comprehensive. Insuree: Ren- 

ata dell’Angela.” 

I could have been no more 
grateful had she given me the 
Company Mint. 

But I had no chance to ex- 
amine it. Gogarty was calling for 
me. I hastily swallowed my cof- 
fee and reported for orders. 

They were simple enough. The 
appointment with Zorchi that I 
hadn’t been able to keep the day 
before was set up for right then. 
I was already late and I had to 

32 



leave without another glance at 
Rena’s file. 

The hospital Zorchi honored 
with his patronage was a marble- 
hailed palace on the cliff^s that 
rimmed the southern edge of the 
Bay of Naples. It was a luxurious, 
rich man’s hospital, stuffy with 
its opulence; but the most opu- 
lent of all was the plush-lined 
three-room suite where Zorchi was. 

A white-robed sister of some 
religious order led me into a si- 
lent elevator and along a statued 
hall. She tapped on a door, and 
left me in the care of a sharp- 
faced young man with glasses 
who introduced himself as Mr. 
Zorchi’s secretary. 

I explained my business. He 
contemptuously waved me to a 
brocaded chair, and left me alone 
for a good half hour. 

By the time Zorchi was ready 
to see me, I was boiling. Nobody 
could treat a representative of 
the Company like an errand boy! 

I did my best to take into con- 
sideration the fact that he had 
just undergone major surgery — 
first under the wheels of the train, 
then under the knives of three of 
Naples’ finest surgeons. 

I said as pleasantly as I could, 4 
“I’m glad to see you at last.” 

T he dark face on the pink 
embroidered pillow turned 
coldly toward me. “Che volete?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he demanded. The secretary 
opened his mouth to translate. 

I said quickly, “Scusi; parlo un 
po’ la lingua. Non bisogno un 
traduttore.” 

Zorchi said languidly in Italian, 
“In that case, Mario, you may 
go. What do you want with me, 
Weels?” 

I explained my duties as a 
Claims Adjuster for the Com- 
pany, pointing out that it was my 
task, indeed my privilege, to 
make settlement for injuries cov- 
ered by Company policies. He 
listened condescendingly. I 
watched him carefully while I 
talked, trying to estimate the ap- 
proach he might respond to if I 
was to win his confidence. 

He was far from an attractive 
young man, I thought. No longer 
behind the shabby porter’s uni- 
form he had worn on the plat- 
form of the station, he still had 
an unkempt and slipshod appear- 
ance, despite the heavy silken 
dressing gown he wore and the 
manifest costliness of his room. 
The beard was still on his face; 
it, at least, had not been a dis- 
guise. It was not an attractive 
beard. It had been weeks, at the 
least, since any hand had trim- 
med it to shape and his hair was 
just as shaggy. 

Zorchi was not impressed with 
my friendly words. When I had 
finished, he said coldly, “I have 



had claims against the Company 
before, Weels. Why is it that this 
time you make speeches at me?” 

I said carefully, “Well, you 
must admit you are a rather im- 
usual case.” 

“Case?” He frowned fiercely. 
“I am no case, Weels. I am 
Zorchi, if you please.” 

“Of course, of course. I only 
mean to say that — ” 

“That I am a statistic, eh?” He 
bobbed his head. “Surely. I com- 
prehend. But I am not a statistic, 
you see. Or, at best, I am a sta- 
tistic which will not fit into your 
electronic machines, am I not?” 

I admitted, “As I say, you are 
a rather unusual ca — a rather un- 
usual person, Mr. Zorchi.” 

He grinned coldly. “Good. We 
are agreed. Now that we have 
come to that understanding, are 
we finished with this interview?” 
I coughed. “Mr. Zorchi, I’ll be 
frank with you.” He snorted, but 
I went on, “According to your 
records, this claim need not be 
paid. You see, you already have 
been paid for total disability, 
both a lump sum and a continu- 
ing settlement. There is no possi- 
bility of two claims for the loss 
of your legs, you must realize.” 
He looked at me with a touch 
of amusement. “I must?” he 
asked. “It is odd. I have discussed 
this, you understand, with many 
attorneys. The premiums were

paid, were they not? The lan- 
guage of the policy is clear, is it 
not? My legs — would you like 
to observe the stumps yourself?” 

TTE FLUNG the silken covers 
-*■ off. I averted my eyes from 
the white-bandaged lower half of 
his torso, hairy and scrawny and 
horribly less than a man’s legs 
should be. 

I said desperately, “Perhaps I 
spoke too freely. I do not mean, 
Mr. Zorchi, that we will not pay 
your claim. The Company always 
lives up to the letter of its con- 
tracts.” 

He covered himself casually. 
“Very well. Give the check to my 
secretary, please. Are you con- 
cluded?” 

“Not quite.” I swallowed. I 
plunged right in. “Mr. Zorchi, 
what the hell are you up to? How 
do you do it? There isn’t any 
fraud, I admit it. You really lost 
your legs — more than once. You 
grew new ones. But how? Don’t 
you realize how important this 
is? If you can do it, why not 
others? If you are in some way 
pecu — that is, if the structure of 
your body is in some way differ- 
ent from that of others, won’t you 
help us find out how so that we 
can learn from it? It isn’t neces- 
sary for you to live as you do, 
you know.” 

He was looking at me with a 



hint of interest in his close-set, 
dull eyes. I continued, “Even if 
you can grow new legs, do you 
enjoy the pain of having them 
cut off? Have you ever stopped 
to think that some day, perhaps, 
you will miscalculate, and the 
wheels of the train, or the truck,

or whatever you use, may miss 
your legs and kill you? That’s 
no way for a man to live, Mr. 
Zorchi. Why not talk freely to 
me, let me help you? Why not 
take the Company into your con- 
fidence, instead of living by 
fraud and deceit and — ” 



I had gone too far. Livid, he 
snarled, “Ass! That will cost your 
Company, I promise. Is it fraud 
for me to suffer like this? Do I 
enjoy it, do you think? Look, 
ass!” He flung the covers aside 
again, rippeck at the white band- 
ages with his hands — Blood

spurted. He uncovered the raw 
stumps and jerked them at me. 

I do not believe any sight of 
my life shocked me as much as 
that; it was worse than the Ca- 
serta hemp fields, worse than the 
terrible gone moment when 
Marianna died, worse than any- 
thing I could imagine. 

He raved, “See this fraud, look 
at it closely! Truly, I grow new 
legs, but does that make it easier 
to lose the old? It is the pain of 
being born, Weels, a pain you 
will never know! I grow legs, I 
grow arms, I grow eyes. I will 
never die! I will live on like a 
reptile or a fish.” 

His eyes were staring. Ignor- 
ing the blood spurting from his 
stumps, ignoring my attempts to 
say something, he pounded his 
abdomen. “Twelve times I have 
been cut — do you see even a 
scar? My appendix, it is bad; it 
traps filth, and the filth makes 
me sick. And I have it cut out — 
and it grows again; and I have 
it cut out aigain, and it grows 
back. And the pain, Weels, the 
pain never stops!” He flung the 
robe open, slapped his narrow, 
hairy chest. 

I gasped. Under the scjaggly 
hair was a rubble of boils and 
wens, breaking and matting the 
hair as he struck himself in 
frenzy. “Envy me, Weels!” he 
shouted. “Envy the man whose 

36 



body defends itself against every- 
thing! I will live forever, I prom- 
ise it, and I will always be in 
pain, and someone will pay for 
every horrible moment of it! Now 
get out, get out!” 

I left under the hating eyes of 
the sharp-faced secretary who si- 
lently led me to the door. 

1 HAD put Zorchi through a 
tantrum and subjected myself 
to as disagreeable a time as I’d 
ever had. And I hadn’t accom- 
plished a thing. I knew that well 
enough. And if I hadn’t known it 
by myself, I would have found 
out. 

Gogarty pointed it out to me, 
in detail. “You’re a big disap- 
pointment to me,” he moaned 
sourly. “Ah, the hell with it. What 
were you trying to accomplish, 
anyway?” 

I said defensively, “I thought 
I might appeal to his altruism. 
After all, you didn’t give me very 
explicit instructions.” 

“I didn’t tell you to remember 
to wipe your nose either,” he said 
bitterly. He shook his head, the 
anger disappearing. “Well,” he 
said disconsolately, “I don’t sup- 
pose we’re any worse off than we 
were. I guess I’d better try this 
myself.” He must have caught a 
hopeful anticipatory gleam in my 
eye, because he said quickly, 
“Not right now. Wills. You’ve 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



made that impossible. I’ll just 
have to wait until he cools off.” 

I said nothing; just stood there 
waiting for him to let me go. I 
was sorry things hadn’t worked 
out but, after all, he had very 
little to complain about. Besides, 
I wanted to get back to my desk 
and the folder about Rena dell’- 
Angela. It wasn’t so much that I 
was interested in her as a person, 
I reminded myself. I was just 
curious. 

Once again, I had to stay curi- 
ous for a while. Gogarty had 
other plans for me. Before I knew 
what was happening, I was on my 
way out of the office again, this 
time to visit another Neapolitan 
hospital, where some of the se- 
verely injured in the recent war 
were waiting final settlement of 
their claims. It was a hurry-up 
matter, which had been post- 
poned too many times already; 
some of the injured urgently re- 
quired major medical treatment, 
and the hospital was howling for 
approval of their claims before 
they’d begin treatment. 

This one was far from a mar- 
ble palace. It had the appearance 
of a stucco tenement, and all of 
the patients were in wards. I was 
a little surprised to see expediters 
guarding the entrance. 

I asked one of them, “Any- 
thing wrong?” 

He looked at me with a flicker 



of astonishment, recognizing the 
double-breasted Claim Adjuster 
uniform, surprised, I think, at my 
asking him a question. “Not as 
long as we’re here, sir,” he said. 

“I mean, I was wondering what 
you were doing here.” 

The surprise became overt. 
“Vaults,” he said succinctly. 

I PRODDED no further. I knew 
what he meant by vaults, of 
course. It was part of the Com- 
pany’s beneficent plan for ameli- 
orating the effects of even such 
tiny wars as the Naples-Sicily 
affair that those who suffered 
radiation burns got the best 
treatment possible. And the best 
treatment, of course, was sus- 
pended animation. The deadly 
danger of radiation burns lay in 
their cumulative effect; the first 
symptoms were nothing, the man 
was well and able to walk about. 
Degeneration of the system fol- 
lowed soon, the marrow of the 
bone gave up on its task of pro- 
ducing white corpuscles, the 
blood count dropped, the tiny 
radiant poisons in his blood 
spread and worked their havoc. 
If he could be gotten through the 
degenerative period he might 
live. But, if he lived, he would 
still die. That is, if his life pro- 
cesses continued, the radiation 
sickness would kill him. The an- 
swer was to stop the life process,

37 



temporarily, by means of the in- 
jections and deep-freeze in the 
vaults. It was used for more than 
radiation, of course. Marianna, 
for instance — 

Well, anyway, that was what 
the vaults were. These were un- 
doubtedly just a sort of distribu- 
tion point, where local cases were 
received and kept until they 
could be sent to the main Com- 
pany vaults up the coast at Anzio. 

I wasn’t questioning the pres- 
ence of vaults there; I was only 
curious why the Company felt 
they needed guarding. 

I found myself so busy, though, 
that I had no time to think about 
it. A good many of the cases in 
this shabby hospital really need- 
ed the Company’s help. But a 
great many of them were obvious 
attempts at fraud. 

There was a woman, for in- 
stance, in the maternity ward. 
During the war, she’d had to hide 
out after the Capodichino bomb- 
ing and hadn’t been able to reach 
medical service. So her third 
child was going to be a girl, and 
she was asking indemnity under 
the gender-guarantee clause. But 
she had only Class-C coverage 
and her first two had been boys; 
a daughter was permissive in any 
of the first four pregnancies. She 
began swearing at me before I 
finished explaining these simple 
facts to her. 

38 



I walked out of the ward, hot 
under the collar. Didn’t these 
people realize we were trying to 
help them? They didn’t appear 
to be aware of it. Only the terri- 
bly injured, the radiation cases, 
the amputees, the ones under an- 
esthetic — only these gave me 
no arguments, mainly because 
they couldn’t talk. 

1%/I'OST of them were on their 
-LrAway to the vaults, I found. 
My main job was revision of their 
policies to provide for immobili- 
zation. Inevitably, there are some 
people who will try to take ad- 
vantage of anything. 

The retirement clause in the 
basic contract was the joker here. 
Considering that the legal retire- 
ment age under the universal 
Blue Heaven policy was seventy- 
five years — calendar years, not 
metabolic years — there were 
plenty of invalids who wanted a 
few years in the vaults for rea- 
sons that had nothing to do with 
health. If they could sleep away 
two or three decades, they could, 
they thought, emerge at a physi- 
cal age of forty or so and live 
idly off the Company the rest of 
their lives. 

They naturally didn’t stop to 
think that if any such practice 
became common the Company 
would simply be unable to pay 
claims. And they certainly didn’t 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



think, or care that, if the Com- 
pany went bankrupt, the world 
as we knew it would end. 

It was a delicate problem; we 
couldn’t deny them medical care, 
but we couldn’t permit them the 
vaults unless they were either in 
clearly urgent need, or were will- 
ing to sign an extension waiver 
to their policies. 

I saw plenty of that, that after- 
noon. The radiation cases were 
the worst, in that way, because 
they still could talk and argue. 
Even while they were being load- 
ed with drugs, even while they 
could see with their own eyes the 
blood-count graph dipping lower 
and lower, they still complained 
at being asked to sign the waiver. 

There was even some fear of 
the vaults themselves — though 
every living human had surely 
seen the Company’s indoctrina- 
tion films that showed how the 
injected drugs slowed life pro- 
cesses and inhibited the body’s 
own destructive enzymes; how 
the apparently lifeless body, 
down to ambient air temperature, 
would be slipped into its herme- 
tic plastic sack and stacked away, 
row on row, far underground, to 
sleep away the months or years 
or, if necessary, the centuries. 
Time meant nothing to the sus- 
pendees. It was hard to imagine 
being afraid of as simple and 
natural a process as that! 



Although I had to admit that 
the vaults looked a lot like mor- 
gues. 

I didn’t enjoy it. I kept think- 
ing of Marianna. She had feared 
the vaults too, in the childish, un- 
reasoning, feminine way that was 
her characteristic. When the Blue 
Blanket technicians had turned 
up the diagnosis of leukemia, 
they had proposed the sure-thing 
course of putting her under sus- 
pension while the slow-acting 
drugs — - specially treated to 
operate even under those condi- 
tions — worked their cure, but 
she had refused. There had been, 
they admitted, a ninety-nine and 
nine-tenths per cent prospect of 
a cure without suspension. 

It just happened that Mari- 
anna was in the forlorn one-tenth 
that died. 

I couldn’t get her out of my 
mind. The cases who protested 
or whined or pleaded or shrieked 
that they were being tortured 
and embalmed alive didn’t help. 
I was glad when the afternoon 
was over and I could get back 
to the office. 

A S I came in the door, Gogarty 
was coming in, too, from the 
barbershop downstairs. He was 
freshly shaved and bearriing. 

“Quitting time, Tom,” he said 
amiably, though his eyes were 
memorizing the pile of incom- 



PREFERRED RISK 



39 



plete forms on my desk. “All 
work and no play, you know.” 
He nudged me. “Not that you 
need reminding, eh? Still, you 
ought to tell your girl that she 
shouldn’t call you on office time, 
Tom.” 

“Call me? Rena called me?” 
He nodded absently, intent on 
the desk. “Against Company 
rules, you know. Say, I don’t like 
to push you, but aren’t you run- 
ning a little behind here?” 

I said with some irritation, “I 
don’t have much chance to catch 
up, the way I’ve been racing 
around the country, you know. 
And there’s plenty to be done.” 
He said soothingly, “Now, take 
it easy, Tom. I was only trying 
to say that there might be some 
easier way to handle these 
things.” He speared a forth, 
glanced over it casually. He 
frowned. “Take this, for instance. 
The claim is for catching cold as 
a result of exposure during the 
evacuation of Cerignola. What 
would you do with that one?” 
“Why — pay it, I suppose.” 
“And put in the paper work? 
Suppose it’s a phony, Tom? Not 
one case of coryza in fifty is gen- 
uine.” 

“What would you do?” I asked 
resentfully. 

He said without hesitation, 
“Send it back with Form CBB- 
23A192. Ask for laboratory 

40 



smear-test reports.” 

I looked over the form. A long 
letter was attached; it said in 
more detail than was necessary 
that there had been no labora- 
tory service during the brief war, 
at least where the policyholder 
happened to be, and therefore he 
could submit only the affidavits 
of three registered physicians. It 
looked like a fair claim to me. 
If it was up to me, I would have 
paid it automatically. 

I temporized. “Suppose it’s 
legitimate?” 

“Suppose it is? Look at it this 
way, Tom. If it’s phoney, this 
will scare him off, and you’d be 
saving the Company the expense 
and embarrassment of paying off 
a fraudulent claim. If it’s legiti- 
mate, he’ll resubmit it — at a 
time when, perhaps, we won’t be 
so busy. Meanwhile that’s one 
more claim handled and disposed 
of, for our progress reports to the 
Home Office.” 

I STARED at him unbelieving- 
ly. But he looked back in per- 
fect calm, until my eyes dropped. 
After all, I thought, he was right 
in a way. The mountain of work 
on my desk was certainly a log- 
jam, and it had to be broken 
somehow. Maybe rejecting this 
claim would work some small 
hardship in an individual case, 
but what about the hundreds and 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thousands of others waiting for 
attention? Wasn’t it true that no 
small hardship to an individual 
was as serious as delaying all 
those others? 

It was, after all, that very soli- 
citude for the people at large that 
the Company relied on for its 
reputation — that, and the iron- 
clad guarantee of prompt and 
full settlement. 

I said, “I suppose you’re right.” 

He nodded, and turned away. 
Then he paused. “I didn’t mean 
to bawl you out for that phone 
call, Tom,” he said. “Just tell her 
about the rule, will you?” 

“Sure. Oh, one thing.” He wait- 
ed. I coughed. “This girl, Rena. 
I don’t know much about her, 
you know. Is she, well, someone 
you know?” 

He said, “Heavens, no. She was 
making a pest out of herself 
around here, frankly. She has a 
claim, but not a very good one. 
I don’t know all the details, be- 
cause it’s encoded, but the ma- 
chines turned it down automatic- 
ally. I do know that she, uh — ” 
he sort of half winked — “wants 
a favor. Her old man is in trou- 
ble. I’ll look it up for you some 
time, if you want, and get the 
details. I think he’s in the cooler 
— that is, the clinic — up at 
Anzio.” 

He scratched his plump jowls. 
“I didn’t think it was fair to you 



for me to have a girl at dinner 
and none for you; Susan prom- 
ised to bring someone along, and 
this one was right here, getting 
in the way. She said she liked 
Americans, so I told her you 
would be assigned to her case.” 
This time he did wink. “No harm, 
of course. You certainly wouldn’t 
be influenced by any, well, per- 
sonal relationship, if you hap- 
pened to get into one. Oh, a 
funny thing. She seemed to recog- 
nize your name.” 

That was a jolt. “She what?” 
Gogarty shrugged. “Well, she 
reacted to it. ‘Thomas Wills,’ I 
said. She’d been acting pretty 
stand-offish, but she warmed up 
quick. Maybe she just likes the 
name, but right then is when she 
told me she liked Americans.” 

I cleared my throat. “Mr. Go- 
garty,” I said determinedly, 
“please get me straight on some- 
thing. You say this girl’s father 
is in some kind of trouble, and 
you imply she knows me. I want 
to know if you’ve ever had any 
kind of report, or even heard any 
kind of rumor, that would make 
you think that I was in the least 
sympathetic to any anti-Com- 
pany groups? I’m aware that 
there were stories — ” 

He stopped me. “I never heard 
any, Tom,” he said definitely. 

I hesitated. It seemed like a 
good time to open up to Gogarty; 



PREFERRED RISK

I opened my mouth to start, but 
I was too late. Susan called him 
off for what she claimed was an 
urgent phone call and, feeling 
let-down, I watched him waddle 
away. 

Because it was, after all, time 
that I took down my back hair 
with my boss. 

VI^ELL, I hadn’t done any- 
” thing too terribly bad — 
anyway, I hadn’t meant to do 
anything bad. And the circum- 
stances sort of explained it, in a 
way. And it was all in the past, 
and — 

And nothing. I faced the facts. 
I had spent three solid weeks 
getting blind drunk, ranting and 
raving and staggering up to every 
passer-by who would listen and 
whining to him that the Com- 
pany was evil, the Company was 
murderous, the Company had 
killed my wife. 

There was no denying it. And 
I had capped it all off one bleary 
midnight, with a brick through 
the window of the Company 
branch office that served my 
home. It was only a drunken 
piece of idiocy, I kept telling my- 
self. But it was a drunken piece 
of idiocy that landed me in jail, 
that had been permanently in- 
dorsed on every one of my poli- 
cies, that was in the confidential 
pages of my Company service 

42 



record. It was a piece of idiocy 
that anyone might have done. 
But it would have meant deep 
trouble for me, if it hadn’t been 
for the intercession of my wife’s 
remote relative. Chief Underwrit- 
er Defoe. 

It was he who had bailed me 
out. He had never told me how 
he had found out that I was in 
jail. He appeared, read the riot- 
act to me and got me out. He put 
me over the coals later, yes, but 
he’d bailed me out. He’d told me 
I was acting like a child — and 
convinced me of it, which was 
harder. And when he was con- 
vinced I had snapped out of it, 
he personally backed me for an 
appointment to the Company’s 
school as a cadet Claims Ad- 
juster. 

I owed a considerable debt of 
gratitude to my ex-remote-in- 
law, Chief Underwriter Defoe. 

W HILE I still was brooding, 
Gogarty came back. He 
looked unhappy. “Hammond,” he 
said bitterly. “He’s missing. Look, 
was he drunk when you left him 
last night?” I nodded. “Thought 
so. Never showed up for work. 
Not at his quarters. The daily 
ledger’s still open at his office, 
because there’s no responsible 
person to sign it. So naturally 
I’ve got to run out to Caserta 
now, and what Susan will say — ” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He muttered away. 

I remembered the file that was 
buried under the papers on my 
desk, when he mentioned Susan’s 
name. 

As soon as he was out of the 
office, I had it open. 

And as soon as I had it open, 
I stared at it in shock. 

The title page of the sheaf in- 
side was headed: Signorina Ren- 
ata dell’Angela. Age 22; daughter 
of Benedetto dell’Angela; accept- 
ed to general Class-AA; no em- 
ployment. There were more de- 
tails. 

But across all, in big red let- 
ters, was a rubber stamp: Policy 
Canceled. Reassigned Class-E. 

It meant that the sad-eyed 
Rena was completely uninsur- 
able. 

IV 

I 3 HONE or no phone, I still 
had her address. 

It was still daylight when I 
got out of the cab, and I had a 
chance for a good look at the 
house. It was a handsome place 
by day; the size of the huge 
white stucco wall didn’t fit the 
uninsurable notation on Rena’s 
claim. That wall enclosed a gar- 
den; the garden could hardly 
hold less than an AA house. And 
Class-Es were ordinarily either 
sent to public hostels — at the 



Company’s expense, to be sure 
— or existed on the charity of 
friends or relatives. And Class-Es 
seldom had friends in Class-AA 
houses. 

I knocked at the gate. A fat 
woman, age uncertain but ex- 
treme, opened a little panel and 
peered at me. I asked politely, 
“Miss dell’Angela?” 

The woman scowled. “Che 
dice?” 

I repeated: “May I see Miss 
dell’Angela? I’m a Claims Ad- 
juster for the Company. I have 
some business with her in con- 
nection with her policies.” 

“Ha!” said the woman. She 
left it at that for a moment, purs- 
ing her lips and regarding me 
thoughtfully. Then she shrugged 
apathetically. “Momento,” she 
said wearily, and left me standing 
outside the gate. 

From inside there was a mut- 
tering of unfamiliar voices. I 
thought I heard a door open, and 
the sound of steps, but when the 
fat woman came back she was 
alone. 

Silently she opened the door 
and nodded me in. I started auto- 
matically up the courtyard to- 
ward the enclosed house, but she 
caught my arm and motioned me 
toward another path. It led down 
a flowered lane through a grape 
arbor to what might, at one time, 
have been a caretaker’s hut. 



PREFERRED RISK 



43 



I knocked on the door of the 
hut, comprehending where Rena 
dell’ Angela lived as a Class-E un- 
insurable. 

Rena herself opened it, her 
face flushed, her expression sur- 
prised — apprehensive, almost, 
I thought at first. It was the first 
time I had seen her by daylight. 
She was — oh, there was no other 
word. She was lovely. 

She said quickly, “Mr. Wills! 
I didn’t expect you.” 

I said, “You phoned me. I 
came as soon as I could.” 

She hesitated. “I did,” she ad- 
mitted. “It was — I’m sorry, Mr. 
Wills. It was an impulse. I 
shouldn’t have done it.” 

“What was it, Rena?” 

She shook her head. “I am 
sorry. It doesn’t matter. But I 
am a bad hostess; won’t you 
come in?” 

T he room behind the door 
was long and narrow, with 
worn furniture and a door that 
led, perhaps, to another room be- 
hind. It seemed dusty and, hating 
myself as a snooping fool, I took 
careful note that there was a 
faint aroma of tobacco. I had 
been quite sure that she didn’t 
smoke, that evening we had met. 

She gestured at a chair — 
there only were two, both pulled 
up to a crude wooden table, on 
which were two poured cups of 

44 



coffee. “Please sit down,” she in- 
vited. 

I reminded myself that it was, 
after all, none of my business if 
she chose to entertain friends — 
even friends who smoked par- 
ticularly rancid tobacco. And if 
they preferred not to be around 
when I came to the door, why, 
that was their business, not mine. 
I said cautiously, “I didn’t mean 
to interrupt you.” 

“Interrupt me?” She saw my 
eyes on the cups. “Oh — oh, no, 
Mr. Wills. That other cup is for 
you, you see. I poured it when 
Luisa told me you were at the 
gate. It isn’t very good, I’m 
afraid,” she said apologetically. 

I made an effort to sip the cof- 
fee; it was terrible. I set it down. 
“Rena, I just found out about 
your policies. Believe me, I’m 
sorry. I hadn’t known about it, 
when we had dinner together; 
I would have — Well, I don’t 
know what I would have done. 
There isn’t much I can do, truth- 
fully; I don’t want you thinking 
I have any great power. But I 
wish I had known — I might not 
have made you cry, at any rate.” 
She smiled an odd sort of 
smile. “That wasn’t the reason, 
Mr. Wills.” 

“Please call me Tom. Well, 
then, why did you cry?” 

“It is of no importance. 
Please.”

I coughed and tried a different 
tack. “You understand that I do 
have some authority. And I 
would like to help you if I can 
— if you’ll let me.” 

“Let you? How could I pre- 
vent it?” 

Her eyes were deep and dark. 
I shook myself and pulled the 
notes I’d made on her policies 
from my pocket. In the most offi- 
cial voice I could manage, I said, 
“You see, there may be some lee- 
way in interpreting the facts. As 
it stands, frankly, there isn’t 
much hope. But if you’ll give me 
some information — ” 

“Certainly.” 

“All right. Now, your father — 
Benedetto dell’ Angela. He was a 
casualty of the war with Sicily; 
he got a dose of radiation, and he 
is at present in a low-metabolism 
state in the clinic at Anzio, wait- 
ing for the radiogens to clear out 
of his system. Is that correct?” 
“It is what the Company’s re- 
port said,” she answered. 

H er tone was odd. Surely she 
wasn’t doubting a Company 
report! 

“As his dependent, Rena, you 
applied for subsistence benefits 
on his Blue Blanket policies, as 
well as war-risk benefits under 
the Blue Bolt. Both applications 
were refused; the Blue Blanket 
because your father is technically

not hospitalized; the Blue Bolt, 
as well as all your other personal 
policies, was cancelled, because of 
— ” I stuttered over it — “of 
activities against the best interest 
of the Company. Specifically, giv- 
ing aid and comfort to a known 
troublemaker whose name is 
given here as Slovetski.” I showed 
her the cancellation sheet I had 
stolen from the files. 

She shrugged. “This much I 
know, Tom,” she said. 

“Why?” I demanded. “This 
man is believed to have been 
instrumental in inciting the war 
with Sicily!” 

She flared, “Tom, that’s a lie! 
Slovetski is an old friend of my 
father’s — they studied together 
in Berlin, many years ago. He is 
utterly, completely against war 
— any war!” 

I hesitated. “Well, let’s put 
that aside. But you realize that, 
in view of this, the Company can 
maintain — quite properly in a 
technical sense — that you con- 
tributed to the war, and there- 
fore you can’t collect Blue Bolt 
compensation for a war you 
helped bring about. You were 
warned, you see. You can’t even 
say that you didn’t know what 
you were doing.” 

“Tom,” Rena’s voice was in- 
finitely patient and sad. “I knew 
what I was doing.” 

“In that case, Rena, you have 



to admit that it seems fair 
enough. Still, perhaps we can get 
something for you — even if 
only a refund of your premiums. 
The Company doesn’t always fol- 
low the letter of the law, there 
are always exceptions, so — ” 
Her expression stopped me. 
She was smiling, but it was the 
tortured smile of Prometheus 
contemplating the cosmic jest 
that was ripping out his vitals. 

1 ASKED uncertainly, “Don’t 
you believe me?” 

“Believe you, Tom? Indeed I 
do.” She laughed out loud that 
time. “After what happened to 
my father, I assure you, Tom, I 
am certain that the Company 
doesn’t always follow the law.” 

I shook my head quickly. “No, 
you don’t understand. I — ” 

“I understand quite well.” She 
studied me for a moment, then 
patted my hand. “Let us talk of 
something else.” 

“Won’t you tell me why your 
policy was cancelled?” 

She said evenly, “It’s in the 
file. Because I was a bad girl.” 
“But why? Why — ” 

“Because, Tom. Please, no 
more. I know you are trying to 
be just as helpful as you can, but 
there is no help you can give.” 
“You don’t make it easy, 
Rena.” 

“It can’t be easy! You see, I

admit everything. I was warned. 
I helped an old friend whom the 
Company wanted to — shall we 
say — treat for radiation sick- 
ness? So there is no question 
that my policy can be cancelled. 
All legal. It is not the only one 
of its kind, you know. So why 
discuss it?” 

“Why shouldn’t we?” 

Her expression softened. “Be- 
cause — because we do not agree. 
And never shall.” 

I stared at her blankly. She 
was being very difficult. Really, I 
shouldn’t be bothering with her, 
someone I barely knew, someone 
I hadn’t even heard of until — 
That reminded me. I said, 
“Rena, how did you know my 
name?” 

Her eyes went opaque. “Know 
your name, Tom? Why, Mr. Go- 
garty introduced us.” 

“No. You knew of me before 
that. Come clean, Rena. Please.” 
She said flatly, “I don’t know 
what you mean.” She was begin- 
ning to act agitated. I had seen 
her covertly glancing at her 
watch several times; now she 
held it up openly — ostenta- 
tiously, in fact. “I am sorry, but 
you’d better go,” she said with a 
hint of anxiety in her voice. 
“Please excuse me.” 

Well, there seemed no good 
reason to stay. So I went — not 
happily; not with any sense of 

48 



accomplishment; and fully con- 
scious of the figure I cut to the 
unseen watcher in the other 
room, the man whose coffee I 
had usurped. 

Because there was no longer 
a conjecture about whether there 
had been such a person or not. 
I had heard him sneeze three 
times. 

"O ACK at my hotel, a red light 
was flashing on the phone as 
I let myself in. I unlocked the 
play-back with my room key and 
got a recorded message that Go- 
garty wanted me to phone him 
at once. 

He answered the phone on the 
first ring, looking like the wrath 
of God. It took me a moment to 
recognize the symptoms; then it 
struck home. 

The lined gray face, the jittery 
twitching of the head, the slow, 
tortured movements; here was a 
man with a classic textbook case 
of his ailment. The evidence was 
medically conclusive. He had 
been building up to a fancy 
drinking party, and something 
made him stop in the middle. 

There were few tortures worse 
than a grade-A hangover, but one 
of those that qualified was the 
feeling of having the drink die 
slowly, going through the process 
of sobering up without the anes- 
thetic of sleep. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He winced as the scanning 
lights from the phone hit him. 
“Wills,” he said soyrly. “About 
time. Listen, you’ve got to go up 
to Anzio. We’ve got a distin- 
guished visitor, and he wants to 
talk to you.” 

“Me?” 

“You! He knows you — his 
name is Defoe.” 

The name crashed over me; I 
hadn’t expected that, of all things. 
He was a member of the Council 
of Underwriters! I thought they 
never ventured far from the 
Home Office. In fact, I thought 
they never had a moment to 
spare from the awesome duties 
of running the Company. 

Gogarty explained. “He ap- 
peared out of nowhere at Car- 
mody Field. I was still in Caserta! 
Just settling down to a couple 
of drinks with Susan, and they 
phoned me to say Chief Under- 
writer Defoe is on my doorstep!” 
I cut in, “What does he want?” 
Gogarty puffed his plump 
cheeks. “How do I know? He 
doesn’t like the way things are 
going, I guess. Well, I don’t like 
them either! But I’ve been twen- 
ty-six years with the Company, 
and if he thinks. Snooping and 
prying. There are going to be 
some changes in the office, I can 
tell you. Somebody’s been pass- 
ing on all kinds of lying gossip 
and — ” He broke off and stared 

PREFEliRED RISK 



at me calculatingly as an idea 
hit him. 

Then he shook his head. “No. 
Couldn’t be you. Wills, could it? 
You only got here, and Defoe’s 
obviously been getting this stuff 
for weeks. Maybe months. Still 
— Say, how did you come to 
know him?” 

I T WAS none of his business. I 
said coldly, “At the Home Of- 
fice. I guess I’ll take the morning 
plane up to Anzio, then.” 

“The hell you will. You’ll take 
the night train. It gets you there 
an hour earlier.” Gogarty jerked 
his head righteously — then 
winced and clutched his temple. 
He said miserably, “Oh, damn. 
Tom, I don’t like all of this. I 
think something happened to 
Hammond.” 

I repeated, “Happened? What 
could happen to him?” 

“I don’t know. But I found out 
a few things. He’s been seen with 
some mighty peculiar people in 
Caserta. What’s this about some- 
body with a gun waiting at the 
office for him when you were 
there?” 

It took a moment for me to 
figure out what he was talking 
about. “Oh,” I said, “you mean 
the man at the car? I didn’t know 
he had a gun, for certain.” 

“I do,” Gogarty said shortly. 
“The expediters tried to pick him 



49 



up today, to question him about 
Hammond. He shot his way out.” 
I told Gogarty what I knew, 
although it wasn’t much. He lis- 
tened abstractedly anc^ when I 
had finished, he sighed. “Well, 
that’s no help,” he grumbled. 
“Better get ready to catch your 
train.” 

I nodded and reached to cut 
off the connection. He waved 
half-heartedly. “Oh, yes,” he add- 
ed, “give my regards to Susan 
if you see her.” 

“Isn’t she here?” 

He grimaced. “Your friend De- 
foe said he needed a secretary. 
He requisitioned her.” 

1 BOARDED the Anzio train 
from the same platform where 
I had seen Zorchi dive under the 
wheels. But this was no sleek ex- 
press; it was an ancient three-car 
string that could not have been 
less than fifty years out of date. 
The cars were not even air-con- 
ditioned. 

Sleep was next to impossible, 
so I struck up a conversation with 
an expediter-officer. He was 
stand-offish at first but, when he 
found out I was a Claims Ad- 
juster, he mellowed and produced 
some interesting information. 

It was reasonable that Defoe 
would put aside his other duties 
and make a quick visit to Anzio, 
because Anzio seemed to need 

50 



someone to do something about 
it pretty badly. My officer was 
part of a new levy being sent up 
there; the garrison was being 
doubled; there had been trouble. 
He was vague about what kind 
of “trouble” it had been, but it 
sounded like mob violence. I 
mentioned Caserta and the near- 
riot I had been in; the officer’s 
eyes hooded over, and about five 
minutes after that he pointedly 
leaned back and pulled his hat 
over his eyes. Evidently it was 
not good form to discuss actual 
riots. 

I accepted the rebuke, but I 
was puzzled in my mind as I 
tried to get some sleep for my- 
self. 

What kind of a place was this 
Naples, where mobs rioted 
against the Company and even 
intelligent-seeming persons like 
Renata dell’Angela appeared to 
have some reservations about it? 

V 

1 SLEPT, more or less, for an 
hour or so in that cramped 
coach seat. I was half asleep 
when the train-expediter nudged 
my elbow and said, “Anzio.” 

It was early — barely past 
daybreak. It was much too early 
to find a cab. I got directions 
from a drowsing stationmaster 
and walked toward the vaults. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The “clinic,” as the official 
term went, was buried in the feet 
of the hills just beyond the 
beaches. I was astonished at the 
size of it. Not because it was so 
large; on the contrary. It was, as 
far as I could see, only a broad, 
low shed. 

Then it occurred to me that 
the vaults were necessarily al- 
most entirely underground, for 
the sake of economy in keeping 
them down to the optimum sus- 
pendee temperature. It was safe 
enough and simple enough to put 
a man in susjjended animation 
but, as I understood it, it was 
necessary to be sure that the sus- 
pendees never got much above 
fifty degrees temperature for any 
length of time. Above that, they 
had an unwelcome tendency to 
decay. 

This was, I realized, the first 
full-scale “clinic” I had ever seen. 
I had known that the Company 
had hundreds, perhaps thousands, 
of them scattered all over the 
world. 

I had heard that the Com- 
pany had enough of them, mostly 
in out-of-the-way locations, to 
deep-freeze the entire human 
race at once, though that seemed 
hardly reasonable. 

I had even heard some ugly, 
never - quite - made - clear stories 
about why the Company had so 
many clinics . but when peo- 



ple began hinting at such ridicu- 
lous unpleasantness, I felt it was 
my duty to make it clear that I 
wanted to hear no subversive 
talk. So I had never got the de- 
tails — and certainly would nev- 
er have believed them for a mo- 
ment if I had. 

I T WAS very early in the morn- 
ing, as I say, but it seemed that 
I was not the first to arrive at the 
clinic. On the sparse grass before 
the main entrance, half a dozen 
knots of men and women were 
standing around apathetically. 
Some of them glared at me as I 
came near them, for reasons I 
did not understand; others mere- 
ly stared. 

I heard a hoarse whisj>er as I 
passed one group of middle-aged 
women. One of them was saying, 
“Benedetto non e morte.” She 
seemed to be directing it to me; 
but it meant nothing. The only 
comment that came to my some- 
what weary mind was, “So what 
if Benedetto isn’t dead?” 

A huge armed expediter, yawn- 
ing and scratching, let me in to 
the executive office. I explained 
that I had been sent for by Mr. 
Defoe. I had to wait until Mr. 
Defoe was ready to receive me 
and was finally conducted to a 
suite of rooms. 

This might have once been an 
authentic clinic; it had the asep- 



PREFERRED RISK 



51 



tic appearance of a depressing 
hospital room. One for, say, Class- 
es with terminal myasthenia. 
Now, though, it had been refitted 
as a private guest suite, with an 
attempt at luxurious drapes and 
deep stuffed armchairs superim- 
posed on the basic adjustable 
beds and stainless steel plumb- 
ing. 

I hadn’t seen Defoe in some 
time, but he hadn’t changed at 
all. He was, as always, the per- 
fect model of a Company execu- 
tive of general-officer rank. He 
was formal, but not unyielding. 
He was tall, distinguished-gray at 
the temples, spare, immaculately 
outfitted in the traditional vest 
and bow tie. 

I recalled our first meeting. He 
was from the side of Marianna’s 
family that she talked about, and 
she fluttered around for three 
whole days, checking our Blue 
Plate policies for every last exo- 
tic dish we could squeeze out to 
offer him, planning the television 
programs allowed under our en- 
tertainment policies, selecting the 
most respectable of our friends 
— “acquaintances” would be a 
better description; Marianna 
didn’t make friends easily — to 
make up a dinner party. He’d 
arrived at the stroke of the hour 
he was due, and had brought with 
him what was undoubtedly his 
idea of a princely gift for newly- 

52 



weds — a paid-up extra-coverage 
maternity benefit rider on oxir 
Blue Blanket policies. 

We thanked him effusively. 
And, for my part, sincerely. That 
was before I had known Mari- 
anna’s views on children; she had 
no intentions of raising a family. 

A S I walked in on Defoe in his 
private suite at the clinic, he’ 
was standing with his back to 
me, at a small washstand, peer- 
ing at his reflection in a mirror. 
He appeared to have finished 
shaving. I rubbed my own 
bristled chin uneasily. 

He said over his shoulder, 
“Good morning, Thomas. Sit 
down.” 

I sat on the edge of an enor- 
mous wing chair. He pursed his 
lips, stretched the skin under his 
chin and, when he seemed per- 
fectly satisfied the job was com- 
plete, he said as though he were 
continuing a conversation, “Fill 
me in on your interview with 
Zorchi, Thomas.” 

It was the first I’d known he’d 
ever heard of Zorchi. I hesitantly 
began to tell him about the meet- 
ing in the hospital. It did not, I 
knew, do me very much credit, 
but it simply didn’t occur to me 
to try to make my own part look 
better. I suppose that if I thought 
of the matter at all, I simply 
thought that Defoe would in- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stantly detect any attempt to 
gloss things over. He hardly 
seemed to be paying attention to 
me, though; he was preoccupied 
with the remainder ol his morn- 
ing ritual — carefully massaging 
his face with something fragrant, 
brushing his teeth with a mad- 
dening, old-fashioned insistence 
on careful strokes, combing his 
hair almost strand by strand. 

Then he took a small bottle 
with a daub attached to the stop>- 
per and touched it to the distin- 
guished gray at his temples. 

I spluttered in the middle of 
a word; I had never thought of 
the possibility that the hand- 
somely grayed temples of the 
Company’s senior executives, as 
inevitable as the vest or the 
watch chain, were equally a part 
of the uniform! Defoe gave me a 
long inquiring look in the mirror; 
I coughed and went on with a 
careful description of Zorchi’s 
temper tantrum. 

Defoe turned to me and nodd- 
ed gravely. There was neither 
approval nor disapproval. He had 
asked for information and the in- 
formation had been received. 

He pressed a communicator 
button and ordered breakfast. 
The microphone must have been 
there, but it was invisible. He 
sat down at a small, surgical- 
looking table, leatied back and 
folded his hands. 



“Now,” he said, “tell me what 
happened in Caserta just before 
Hammond disappeared.” 

Talking to Defoe had some- 
thing of the quality of shouting 
down a well. I collected my 
thoughts and told him all I knew 
on the riot at the branch office. 

While I was talking, Defoe’s 
breakfast arrived. He didn’t know 
I hadn’t eaten anything, of course 
— I say “of course” because I 
know he couldn’t have known, he 
didn’t ask. I looked at it longing- 
ly, but all my looking didn’t alter 
the fact that there was only one 
plate, one cup, one set of silver- 
ware. 

H e ate his breakfast as me- 
thodically as he’d brushed 
his teeth. I doubt if it took him 
five minutes. Since I finished the 
Caserta story in about three, the 
last couple of minutes were in 
dead silence, Defoe eating, me 
sitting mute as a disconnected 
jukebox. 

Then he pushed the little table 
away, lit a cigarette and said, 
“You may smoke if you wish, 
Thomas. Come in, Susan.” 

He didn’t raise his voice; and 
when, fifteen seconds later, Susan 
Manchester walked in, he didn’t 
look at all impressed with the 
efficiency of his secretary, his in- 
tercom system, or himself. The 
concealed microphone, it oc-

S3 



curred to me, had heard him 
order breakfast and request his 
secretary to walk in. It had im- 
doubtedly heard — and most 
probably recorded — every word 
I had said. 

How well they did things on 
the upper echelon of the Com- 
pany! 

Susan looked — different. She 
was as blonde and pretty as ever. 
But she wasn’t bubbly. She 
smiled at me in passing and hand- 
ed Defoe a typed script, which 
he scanned carefully. 



He asked, “Nothing new on 
Hammond?” 

“No, sir,” she said. 

“All right. You may leave this.” 
She nodded and left. Defoe 
turned back to me. “I have some 
news for you, Thomas. Ham- 
mond has been located.” 

“That’s good,” I said. “Not too 
badly hung over, I hope.” 

He gave me an arctic smile. 
“Hardly. He was found by a cou- 
ple of peasants who were picking 
grapes. He’s dead.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The Necessary Thing 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

The idea behind the machine was splendid 
— if only it did not have ideas ail its own! 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



R ichard Gregor was 
seated at his desk in the 
dusty offices of the AAA 
Ace Interplanetary Decontamin- 
ation Service, staring wearily at 
a list. The list included some 
two thousand three hundred and 
five separate items. 

Gregor was trying to remem- 
ber what, if anything, he had left 
out. Anti-radiation salve? Vac- 
uum flares? Water purification 
kit? Yes, they were all there. 

He yawned and glanced at his 
watch. Arnold, his partner, should 
have been back by now. Arnold 
had gone to order the two thou- 
sand three hundred and five 

THE NECESSARY THING 



items and get them stowed safely 
aboard the spaceship. In a few 
hours, AAA Ace was scheduled 
to blast off on another job. 

But had he listed everything 
important? A spaceship is, neces- 
sarily, an island unto itself, self- 
sufficient, self-sustaining. If you 
ran out of beans on Dementia II, 
there was no corner store where 
you could buy more. No Coast 
Guard hurried out to replace the 
burned-out lining on your main 
drive. You had to have another 
lining on board, and the tools to 
enable you to replace it, and the 
manuals telling how. Space was 
just too big to permit much in 

55 



the way of rescue operations. 

Oxygen extractor? Extra cigar- 
ettes? It was like putting jets on 
a department store, Gregor 
thought. He pushed the list aside, 
found a pack of tattered cards, 
and laid out a complex solitaire 
of his own devising. 

Minutes later, Arnold stepped 
jauntily in. 

G regor looked at Ws partner 
with suspicion. When the lit- 
tle chemist walked with that pe- 
culiar bouncing step, his round 
face beaming happily, it often re- 
sulted in trouble for AAA Ace. 

“Did you get the stuff?” Gre- 
gor asked. <• 

“I did better than that,” Arnold 
said proudly. “I have just saved 
us a considerable sum of money.” 
“Oh, no,” Gregor sighed. “What 
have you done?” 

“Consider,” Arnold said im* 
pressively, “just consider the 
sheer waste in equipping the 
average expedition. We pack two 
thousand three hundred and five 
items, just on the off chance we 
may need one. Our payload is 
diminished, our living space is 
cramped, and most of the stuff 
never gets used.” 

“Except for once or twice,” 
Gregor said, “when it just hap- 
pens to save our lives.” 

“I took that into account. I 
gave the whole problem careful 



study. And, through a bit of luck, 
I found the one and only thing 
an expedition needs. The neces- 
sary thing.” 

Gregor arose and towered over 
his partner. Visions of mayhem 
danced through his brain, but he 
controlled himself with an effort. 
“Arnold, I don’t know what 
you’ve done. But you’d better 
get those two thousand three hun- 
dred and five items on board and 
get them fast.” 

“Can’t do it,” Arnold said with 
a nervous little laugh. “The mon- 
ey’s gone. This thing will pay for 
itself, though.” 

“What thing?” 

“The one really necessary 
thing. Come out to the ship and 
I’ll show you.” 

Gregor couldn’t get another 
word out of him. Arnold smiled 
mysteriously on the long drive 
to Idlewild Spaceport. Their ship 
was already in a blast pit, sched- 
uled for takeoff in a few hours. 

Arnold swung the port open 
with a flourish. “There! Behold 
the answer to an expedition’s 
prayers.” 

Gregor stepped inside. He saw 
a large and fantastic-looking ma- 
chine with dials, lights and indi- 
cators scattered haphazardly 
over it. 

“Isn’t it a beauty?” Arnold 
patted the machine affectionate- 
ly- “Joe the Interstellar Junkman

happened to have it tucked away. 
I conned it out of him for a song.” 

T hat settled it as far as Gre- 
gor was concerned. He had 
dealt with Joe the Interstellar 
Junkman before, and had inevit- 
ably come out on the shortest 
end of the deal. Joe’s gadgets 
worked, but when, how often, and 
with what kind of attitude, was 
something else again. 

Gregor was stern. “No gadget 
of Joe’s is going into space with 
me. Not again. Maybe we can 
sell it for scrap metal.” He began 
to hunt around for a wrecking 
bar. 

“Wait,” Arnold begged. “Let 
me show you. Consider. We are 
in deep space. The main drive 
falters and fails. Upon examina- 
tion, we find that a quarter-inch 
durraloy nut has worked its way 
off the number three pinion. We 
can’t find the nut. What do we 
do?” 

“We take a new nut from the 
two thousand three hundred and 
five items we’ve packed for emer- 
gencies just like this,” Gregor 
said. 

“Ah! But you didn’t include 
any quarter-inch durraloy nuts!” 
Arnold was triumphant. “I 
checked the list. What then?” 

“I don’t know, you tell me.” 
Arnold stepped up to the ma- 
chine, punched a button and said 



in a loud, clear voice, “Durraloy 
nut, quarter-inch diameter.” 

The machine murmured and 
hummed — Lights flashed — A 
panel slid back, revealing a 
bright, freshly machined durra- 
loy nut. 

“That’s what we do,” Arnold 
said. 

“Hmm,” Gregor was not par- 
ticularly impressed. “So it manu- 
factures nuts. What else does it 
do?” 

Arnold pressed the button 
again. “A pound of fresh shrimp.” 

When he slid back the panel, 
the shrimp were there. 

“I should have had it peel 
them,” Arnold said. “Oh, well.” 
He pressed the button. “A graph- 
ite rod, four feet long with a 
diameter of two inches.” 

The panel opened wider this 
time to let the rod come through. 

“What else can it do?” Gregor 
asked. 

“What else would you like?” 
Arnold said. “A small tiger cub? 
A Model-A updraft carburetor? 
Possibly a 25-watt light bulb? 
Or a stick of chewing gum?” 

“You mean it’ll turn out any- 
thing?” Gregor asked. 

“Anjrthing at all. It’s a Con- 
figurator. Go ahead, try it your- 
self.” 

Gregor tried and produced in 
rapid succession, a pint of fresh 
water, a wrist watch, and a jar of 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Mother Merton’s cocktail sauce. 

“Hmm,” he said. 

“See what I mean? Isn’t this 
better than packing two thou- 
sand three hundred and five 
items? Isn’t it simpler and more 
logical to produce what you need 
when you need it?” 

“It seems good,” Gregor said. 
“But . .” 

“But what?” 

Gregor shook his head. What 
indeed? He had no idea. It had 
simply been his sad experience 
that gadgets are never as useful, 
reliable or consistent as they 
seem at first glance. 

He thought deeply, then 
punched the button. “A transis- 
tor, series GE 1324E.” 

The machine hummed. And 
there was the tiny transistor. 

“Seems pretty good,” Gregor 
admitted. “What are you doing, 
now?” 

“I’m peeling the shrimp,” Ar- 
nold said. 

After enjoying a tasty shrimp 
cocktail, the partners received 
their clearance from the tower. In 
an hour, the ship was in space. 

T hey were bound for Dennett 
IV, an average-sized world in 
the Sycophax cluster. Dennett 
was a hot, steamy, fertile planet, 
suffering from only one major 
difficulty: Too much rain. It 

rained on Dennett nine-tenths of 

THE NECESSARY THING 



the time, and when it wasn’t rain- 
ing, it was threatening rain. 

Fortunately, the principles of 
climate control were well-known, 
since many worlds suffered from 
similar difficulties. It would take 
only a few days for AAA Ace to 
interrupt and alter the climate 
pattern. 

After an uneventful trip, Den- 
nett came into view. Arnold re- 
lieved the automatic pilot and 
brought the ship down through 
thick cloud banks. They dropped 
through miles of pale, gossamer 
mist. At last, mountain-tops be- 
gan to appear, and then they saw 
a level, barren gray plain. 

“Odd color for a landscape,” 
Gregor said . 

Arnold nodded. With practiced 
ease he spiraled, leveled out, 
came down neatly above the 
plain and, with his forces bal- 
anced, cut the drive. 

Gregor had a sudden premoni- 
tion of disaster. “Take her up!” 
he shouted. Reacting instinctive- 
ly, Arnold jabbed at the firing 
control and missed. The ship 
hung for a moment, then dropped 
through the plain and fell an- 
other eight feet toward the 
ground. 

The plain, it seemed, was fog 
of a density only Dennett could 
produce. 

Hastily they unbuckled them- 
selves and tested various teeth, 

59 



bones and ligatures. Upon find- 
ing that nothing personal was 
broken, they thoroughly checked 
the ship. 

The impact hadn’t done their 
old spaceship any good. The 
radio and automatic pilot were a 
complete loss. Several stern 
plates had buckled and, worst of 
all, some delicate components in 
the turn-drive control were shat- 
tered. 

“We were lucky at that,” Ar- 
nold said. 

“Yeah.” Gregor peered through 
the blanketing mist. “But next 
time we use radar.” 

“In a way I’m glad it hap- 
pened,” Arnold said. “Now you’ll 
see what a lifesaver the Configur- 
ator really is. Let’s get to work.” 

T hey listed all the damaged 
parts. Arnold stepped up to 
the Configurator, pressed the but- 
ton and said, “A drive plate, five 
inches square, half-inch diameter, 
steel alloy 342.” 

The machine quickly turned it 
out. 

“We need ten of them,” Gregor 
said. 

“I know.” Again Arnold pressed 
the button. “Another one.” 

The machine did nothing. 
“Probably have to give the 
whole command,” Arnold said. 
He punched the button again and 
said, “Drive plate, five inches 

60 



square, half-inch diameter, steel 
alloy 342.” 

The machine was silent. 
“That’s odd,” Arnold said. 
“Isn’t it, though?” Gregor had 
an odd sinking sensation in the 
pit of his stomach. 

Arnold tried again with no suc- 
cess. He thought deeply, then 
punched the button and said, “A 
plastic teacup.” 

The machine turned out a tea- 
cup of bright blue plastic. 

“Another one,” Arnold order- 
ed. When the Configurator did 
nothing, Arnold asked for a wax 
crayon. The machine gave it to 
him. “Another wax crayon.” The 
machine did nothing. “That’s in- 
teresting. I suppose someone 
should have thought of that pos- 
sibility.” 

“What possibility?” 
“Apparently the Configurator 
will turn out anything,” Arnold 
said. “But only once.” 

“That’s fine. We need nine 
more plates. And the turn-drive 
controls need four identical parts. 
What are we going to do?” 

“We’ll think of something.” 
“I hope so,” Gregor said. 
Outside the rain began. The 
partners settled down to think. 

I ■'HERE’S only one explana- 
-I- tion,” Arnold said .several 
hours later. “Pleasure principle.” 
“Huh?” Gregor asked. He had 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been dozing, lulled by the patter 
of rain against the hull of their 
spaceship. 

“This machine must have some 
form of intelligence,” Arnold 
said. “After all, it receives stim- 
uli, translates ’em into action 
commands, and fabricates a prod- 
uct from a mental blueprint.” 
“Sure it does. But only once.” 
“Yes. But why only once? 
That’s the key to our difficulties. 
I think it must be a self-imposed 
limit linked to a pleasure drive.” 
“I don’t follow you,” Gregor 
said. 

“Look. The builders wouldn’t 
have limited their machine in this 
way purposely. The only possible 
explanation is this: When a ma- 
chine is constructed on this order 
of complexity, it takes on quasi- 
human characteristics. It derives 
a mechanical pleasure from pro- 
ducing a new thing. But a thing 
is only new once. After that, the 
Configurator wants to do some- 
thing else.” 

Gregor slumped back into his 
apathetic half-slumber. 

Arnold went on talking. “Ful- 
fillment of potential, that’s what 
a machine wants. The Configura- 
tor’s desire is to create every- 
thing possible. From this point 
of view, repetition would be a 
waste of time, as well as boring.” 
“That’s the most suspect line 
of reasoning I’ve ever heard,” 



Gregor said. “But, assuming you 
are right, what can we do about 
it?” 

“I don’t know,” Arnold said. 

“That’s what I thought.” 

For dinner that evening, the 
Configurator turned out a very 
creditable roast beef. They fin- 
ished with apple pie a la machina 
with sharp cheese on the side. 
Their morale was considerably 
improved. 

“Substitutions,” Gregor said 
later, smoking a cigar a la ma- 
china. “That’s what we’ll have to 
try. Alloy 342 isn’t the only thing 
we can use for the plates. There 
are plenty of materials that’ll last 
until we get back to Earth.” 

T he Configurator couldn’t be 
tricked into producing a plate 
of iron, or any of the steel alloys. 
They asked for and received a 
plate of bronze. But then the 
machine wouldn’t give them cop- 
per or tin. Aluminum was accept- 
able, as was cadmium, platinum, 
gold and silver. A tungsten plate 
was an interesting rarity; Arnold 
wished he knew how the machine 
had cast it. Gregor vetoed plu- 
tonium, and they were running 
short of suitable metals. Arnold 
hit upon an extra-tough ceramic 
as a good substitute. And the 
final plate was pure zinc. 

The noble metals would tend 
to melt in the heat of space, of 



THE NECESSARY THING 



61 



course. But with proper refrigera- 
tion, they might last as far as 
Earth. All in all, it was a good 
night’s work, and the partners 
toasted each other with an excel- 
lent, though somewhat oily, 
sherry. 

The next day, they bolted the 
plates into place and surveyed 
their handiwork. The rear of their 
ship looked like a patchwork 
quilt. 

“I think it’s quite pretty,” Ar- 
nold said. 

“I just hope it’ll last,” said 
Gregor. “Now for the turn-drive 
components.” 

But that was a different prob- 
lem altogether. Four identical 
parts were missing — delicate, 
precisely engineered affairs of 
glass and wire. No substitutions 
were possible. 

The Configurator turned out 
the first without hesitation. But 
that was all. By noon, both men 
were disgusted. 

“Any ideas?” Gregor asked. 

“Not at the moment. Let’s take 
a break for lunch.” 

They decided that lobster 
salad would be pleasant and or- 
dered it on the machine. The 
Configurator hummed for a mo- 
ment, but produced nothing. 

“What’s wrong now?” Gregor 
glared at the machine. 

“I was afraid of this,” Arnold 
said. 

62 



“Afraid of what? We haven’t 
asked for lobster before.” 

“No,” Arnold said, “but we did 
ask for shrimp. Both are shellfish. 
I’m afraid the Configurator is be- 
ginning to make decisions accord- 
ing to classes.” 

“Then you’d better break out 
a few cans.” 

Arnold smiled feebly. “Well, 
after I bought the Configurator, I 
didn’t think we’d have to bother. 
I mean — ” 

“No cans?” 

“Nope.” 

They returned to the machine 
and asked for salmon, trout and 
tuna, without results. Then they 
tried roast pork, leg of lamb and 
veal. Nothing. 

“I guess it considers our roast 
beef representative of all mam- 
mals,” Arnold said. “This is in- 
teresting. We might be able to 
evolve a whole new theory of 
classes — ” 

“While starving to death,” Gre- 
gor interrupted. He tried roast 
chicken, and this time the Con- 
figurator came through without 
hesitation. 

“Eureka!” Arnold shouted. 

“Damn!” Gregor said. “I should 
have asked for a turkey. A big 
one.” 

T he rain continued to fall on 
Dennett and mist swirled 
around the spaceship’s gaudy 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



patchwork stern. Arnold began a 
long series of slide-rule calcula- 
tions. 

Gregor finished off the sherry, 
tried unsuccessfully to order a 
case of Scotch, and started play- 
ing solitaire. He always did his 
best thinking while playing. 

They ate a frugal supper on 
the remains of the chicken and 
then Arnold completed his calcu- 
lations. 

“It might work,” he said. 

“What might work?” 

“The pleasure principle.” Ar- 
nold stood up and began to pace 
the cabin. “This machine has 
quasi-human characteristics. Cer- 
tainly it possesses learning po- 
tential. I think we can teach it to 
derive pleasure from producing 
the same thing many times. 
Namely, the turn-drive compon- 
ents.” 

“It’s worth a try,” Gregor 
agreed. “But now you know why 
Configurators wound up at Joe 
the Junkman’s instead of on the 
market.” 

Late into the night, they talked 
to the machine. Arnold mur- 
mured persuasively about the 
joys of Repetition. Gregor spoke 
highly of the esthetic values in- 
herent in producing an artistic 
object such as a turn-drive com- 
ponent, not once but many times, 
each item an exact and perfect 
duplicate. 



Arnold murmured lyrically to 
the machine about the thrill, the 
supreme thrill of fabricating end- 
lessly parts without end; again 
and again, the same parts, pro- 
duced of the same material, 
turned out at the same rate. Ec- 
stasy! 

And, Gregor put in. Repetition 
was so beautiful a concept philo- 
sophically and so completely suit- 
ed to the peculiar makeup and 
capabilities of a machine. As a 
conceptual system, he continued. 
Repetition (as opposed to mere 
Creation) closely approached the 
status of entropy, which, mechan- 
istically, was perfection. 

By clicks and flashes, the Con- 
figurator showed that it was lis- 
tening intently. And when Den- 
nett’s damp and pallid dawn was 
in the sky, Arnold pushed the 
button and gave the command 
for a turn-drive component. 

The machine hesitated. Lights 
flickered uncertainly, indicators 
turned in a momentary hunting 
process. Doubt showed in every 
tube. 

There was a click. The panel 
slid back — and there was anoth- 
er turn-drive component. 

“Success!” Gregor shouted, and 
slapped Arnold on the back. 
Quickly he gave the order again. 
But this time the Configurator 
emitted a loud and emphatic 
buzz. 



THE NECESSARY THING 



63 



And produced nothing. 

Gregor tried again. But there 
was no more uncertainty from the 
machine — and no more com- 
ponents. 

“What’s wrong now?” Gregor 
asked. 

“It’s obvious,” Arnold said sad- 
ly. “It decided to give repetition 
a try, just in case it had missed 
something. But after trying it, the 
Configurator decided it didn’t like 
it.” 

“A machine that doesn’t like 
repetition!” Gregor groaned. “It’s 
inhuman!” 

“On the contrary,” Arnold said 
unhappily. “It’s all too damned 
human.” 

TT WAS suppertime, and the 

partners had to rack their 
memories for foods the Configur- 
ator would produce. A vegetable 
plate was easy enough, but not 
too filling. The machine allowed 
them one loaf of bread, but no 
cake. Milk products were out, 
since they had had cheese the 
other day. 

Finally, after an hour of trial 
and error, the Configurator gave 
them a pound of whale steak, 
apparently imcertain as to its 
category. 

Gregor went back to work, 
crooning the joys of repetition in- 
to the machine’s receptors. A 
steady hum and occasional flash- 



es of light showed that the Con- 
figurator was listening. It was a 
hopeful sign. 

Arnold took out several refer- 
ence books and embarked on a 
project of his own. Several hours 
later he looked up with a shout 
of triumph. “I knew I’d find it!” 

“What?” 

“A substitute turn-drive con- 
trol!” He pushed the book under 
Gregor’s nose. “Look there. A sci- 
entist on Vednier II perfected 
this fifty years ago. It’s clumsy, 
by modern standards, but it’ll 
work. And it’ll fit into our ship.” 

“But what’s it made of?” Gre- 
gor asked. 

“That’s the best part of it. We 
can’t miss! It’s made of rubber!” 

Quickly he punched the Con- 
figurator’s button and read the 
description of the turn-drive con- 
trol. 

Nothing happened. 

“You have to turn out the Ved- 
nier control!” Arnold shouted at 
the machine. “If you don’t, you’re 
violating your own principles!” 
He punched the button and, 
enunciating with painful clarity, 
read the description again. 

Nothing happened. 

Gregor had a sudden terrible 
suspicion. He walked to the back 
of the Configurator, found what 
he had feared and pointed it out 
to Arnold. 

There was a manufacturer’s 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



plate bolted there. It read: Class 
3 ConfiguratoT. Made by Vednier 
Laboratories, Vednier II. 

“So they’ve already used it for 
that,” Arnold said. 

Gregor didn’t speak. There just 
didn’t seem to be anything to say. 

M ildew was beginning to 
form inside the spaceship, 
and rust had already appeared 
on the steel plate in the stern. 
The machine still listened to the 
partners’ song of repetition, but 
did nothing about it. 

The problem of another meal 
came up. Fruit was out because 
of the apple pie, as were all 
meats, vegetables, milk products, 
fish and cereals. At last they 
dined sparsely on frogs’ legs, 
baked grasshoppers (from an old 
Chinese recipe) and filet of igu- 
ana. But now, with lizards, in- 
sects and amphibians used up, 
they knew that their machine- 
made meals were practically at 
an end. 

Both men were showing signs 
of strain. Gregor’s long face be- 
came bonier than ever. Arnold 
found traces of mildew forming 
in his hair. 

Outside, the rain poured cease- 
lessly, dripped past the portholes 
and into the moist ground. The 
spaceship began to settle, bury- 
ing itself under its own weight 
For their next meal they could 



think of nothing whatever. 

Then Gregor conceived an 
idea. 

He thought it over carefully. 
Another failure would shatter 
their badly bent morale. But, 
slim though the chance of success 
might be, he had to try it 

Slowly he approached the Con- 
figurator. 

Arnold looked up, frightened 
by the wild light gleaming in his 
eyes. “Gregor! What are you go- 
ing to do?” 

“I’m going to give this thing 
one last command.” With a 
trembling hand, Gregor punched 
the button and whispered his re- 
quest. 

There was a moment of utter 
silence. Then Arnold shouted, 
“Get back!” 

The Configurator was quiver- 
ing and shaking, dials twitching, 
lights flickering. Heat and energy 
gauges flashed through red into 
purple. 

“What did you tell it to pro- 
duce?” Arnold asked. 

“I didn’t tell it to produce any- 
thing,” Gregor said. “I told it to 
reproduce!” 

The Configurator gave a con- 
vulsive shudder and emitted a 
cloud of black smoke. The part- 
ners coughed and gasped for air. 

When the smoke cleared away, 
the Configurator was still there, 
its paint chipped and several in- 



THE NECESSARY THING 



65 



dicators bent out of shape. And, 
beside it, glistening with machine 
oil, new and factory-fresh, was a 
duplicate Configurator. 

“You’ve done it!” Arnold was 
exultant. “You’ve saved us!” 

“I’ve done more than that,” 
Gregor said with weary satisfac- 
tion. “I’ve made our fortunes.” 
He turned to the duplicate Con- 
figurator, pressed its button and 
cried, “Reproduce yourself!” 

W ITHIN a week, Arnold, Gre- 
gor and three Configurators 
were back in Idlewild Spaceport, 
the work on Dennett completed. 
As soon as they landed, Arnold 
left the ship and caught a taxi. 

He went first to Canal Street, 
then to midtown New York. His 
business didn’t take long and 
soon he was back at the ship. 

“Yes, it’s all right,” he called 
to Gregor. “I contacted several 
jewelers. We can dispose of quite 
a few big stones without depress- 
ing the market. After that, I think 
we should have the Configurators 



concentrate on radium for a 
while, and then — What’s 
wrong?” 

Gregor looked at him sourly. 
“Notice anything different?” 
“Huh?” Arnold stared around 
the cabin, at Gregor, and at the 
Configurators. 

Then he noticed it. 

There were four Configurators 
in the cabin, where there had 
been only three. 

“You had one of them repro- 
duce?” Arnold asked. “Nothing 
wrong with that. Just tell them 
to turn out a diamond apiece — ” 
“You still don’t get it Watch.” 
Gregor pressed the button on the 
nearest Configurator and said, “A 
diamond.” 

The Configurator began to 
quiver. 

“Repetition!” Gregor said. “It’s 
ruined everything. You and your 
damned pleasure principle.” 

The machine shook all over 
and produced — 

Another Configurator.

and the Physicist

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Z EN the Terrible lay quies- 
cent in the secret retreat 
which housed his corporeal 
being, all the aspects of his per- 
sonality wallowing in the luxury 
of a day off. How glad he was 
that he’d had the forethought to 
stipulate a weekly holiday for 
himself when first this godhood 
had been thrust upon him, hun- 
dreds of centuries before. He’d 
accepted the perquisites of divin- 
ity with pleasure then. It was 
some little time before he discov- 
ered its drawbacks, and by then 
it was too late; he had become 
the established church. 

All the aspects of his person- 
ality rested . save one, that is. 
And that one, stretching out an 
impalpable tendril of curiousity, 
brought back to his total con- 
sciousness the news that a space- 
ship from Earth had arrived when 
no ship from Earth was due. 

So what? the total conscious- 
ness asked lazily of itself. Prob- 
ably they have a large out-ot- 
season order for hajench. My 
hajench going to provide salad 
bowls for barbarians! 

When, twenty years previous- 
ly, the Earthmen had come back 
to their colony on Uxen after a 
lapse of thousands of years, Zen 
had been hopjeful that they would 
take some of the Divine Work 
off his hands. After all, since it 
was they who had originally es- 




THE PRINCESS AND THE PHYSICIST 



69 



tablished the colony, it should be 
their responsibility. But it seemed 
that all humans, not merely the 
Uxeriach, were irresponsible. The 
Earthmen were interested only 
in trade and tribute. They even 
refused to believe in the exist- 
ence of Zen, an attitude which he 
found extremely irritating to his 
ego. 

T rue, Uxen prospered com- 
mercially to a mild extent 
after their return, for the local 
ceramics that had been devel- 
oped in the long interval found 
wide acceptance throughout the 
Galaxy, particularly the low 
bowls which had hitherto been 
used only for burning incense be- 
fore Zen the Formidable. 

Now every two-bit planet of- 
fered hajench in its gift shops. 

Culturally, though, Uxen had 
degenerated under the new Earth 
administration. No more crimi- 
nals were thrown to the skwitch. 
Xwoosh lost its interest when 
new laws prohibited the ancient 
custom of executing the losing 
side after each game. 

There was no tourist trade, for 
the planet was too far from the 
rest of the Galaxy. The commer- 
cial spaceships came only once 
every three months and left the 
same day. The two destroyers 
that “guarded” the planet arrived 
at rare intervals for fueling or 



repairs, but the crew never had 
anything to do with the Uxenach. 
Local ordinance forbade the 
maidens of Uxen to speak to the 
outlanders, and the outlanders 
were not interested in any of the 
other native products. 

But the last commercial space- 
ship had departed less than three 
weeks before on its regular run, 
and this was not one of the guard 
ships. 

Zen reluctantly conceded to 
himself that he would have to 
investigate this situation further, 
if he wanted to retain his reputa- 
tion for omniscience. Sometimes, 
in an occasional moment of self- 
doubt, he wondered if he weren’t 
too much of a perfectionist, but 
then he rejected the thought as 
self-sacrilege. 

Zen dutifully intensified the 
beam of awareness and returned 
it to the audience chamber where 
the two strange Earthmen who 
had come on the ship were being 
ushered into the presence of the 
king by none other than Guj, the 
venerable prime minister himself. 

“Gentlemen,” Guj beamed, his 
long white beard vibrating in an 
excess of hospitality, “His Gra- 
cious Majesty will be delighted 
to receive you at once.” 

And crossing his wrists in the 
secular xa, he led the way to 
where Uxlu the Fifteenth was 
seated in full regalia upon his im- 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



posing golden, gem-encrusted 
throne. 

Uxlu himself, Zen admitted 
grudgingly, was an imposing 
sight to anyone who didn’t know 
the old yio. The years — for he 
was a scant decade younger than 
Guj — had merely lent dignity to 
his handsome features, and he 
was still tall and upright. 

“Welcome, Earthlings, to Ux- 
en,” King Uxlu said in the sonor- 
ous tones of the practiced public 
speaker. “If there is aught we can 
do to advance your comfort 
whilst you sojourn on our little 
planet, you have but to speak.” 

He did not, Zen noted with 
approval, rashly promise that re- 
quests would necessarily be 
granted. Which was fine, because 
the god well knew who the car- 
rier out of requests would be — 
Zen the Almighty, the All-Power- 
ful, the All-Put-Upon. 

“Thank you. Your Majesty,” 
the older of the two scientists 
said. “We merely seek a retired 
spot in which to conduct our re- 
searches.” 

“Researches, eh?” the king re- 
peated with warm interest. “Are 
you perhaps scientists?” 

“Yes, Your Majesty.” Every 
one of Zen’s perceptors quivered 
expectantly. Earth science was 
banned on Uxen, with the result 
that its acquisition had become 
the golden dream of every Uxena, 



including, of course, their god. 

The older scientist gave a stiff 
bow. “I am an anthropologist. My 
name is Kendrick, Professor Al- 
pheus Kendrick. My assistant, 
Dr. Peter Hammond — ” he indi- 
cated the tall young man with 
him — “is a physicist.” 

T he king and the prime min- 
ister conferred together in 
whisjjers. Zen wished he could 
join them, but he couldn’t ma- 
terialize on that plane without 
incense, and he preferred his sub- 
jects not to know that he could 
be invisibly present, especially 
on his day off. Of course, his Im- 
material Omnipresence was a 
part of the accepted dogma, but 
there is a big difference between 
accepting a concept on a basis of 
faith or of proven fact. 

“Curious researches,” the king 
said, emerging from the confer- 
ence, “that require both physics 
and anthropology.” 

“Yes,” said Kendrick. “They 
are rather involved at that.” Peter 
Hammond shuffled his feet 

“Perhaps some of our techni- 
cians might be of assistance to 
you,” the king suggested. “They 
may not have your science, but 
they are very adept with their 
hands. .” 

“Our researches are rather lim- 
ited in scope,” Kendrick assured 
him. “We can do everything need- 



THE PRINCESS AND THE PHYSICIST 



71 



ful quite adequately ourselves. 
All we need is a place in which 
to do it.” 

“You shall have our own sec- 
ond-best palace,” the king said 
graciously. “It has both hot and 
cold water laid on, as well as cen- 
tral heating.” 

“We’ve brought along our own 
collapsible laboratory - dwelling,” 
Kendrick explained. “We just 
want a spot to set it up.” 

Uxlu sighed. “The royal parks 
are at your disposal. You will un- 
doubtedly require servants?” 

“We have a robot, thanks.” 

“A robot is a mechanical man 
who does all our housework,” 
Hammond, more courteous than 
his superior, explained. Zen won- 
dered how he could ever have 
felt a moment’s uneasiness con- 
cerning these wonderful strang- 
ers. 

“Zen will be interested to hear 
of this,” the prime minister said 
cannily. He and the king nodded 
at one another. 

“Who did you say?” Kendrick 
asked eagerly. 

“Zen the Terrible,” the king 
repeated, “Zen the All-Powerful, 
Zen the Encyclopedic. Surely 
you have heard of him?” he asked 
in some surprise. “He’s Uxen’s 
own particular, personal and pri- 
vate god, exclusive to our planet.” 

“Yes, yes, of course I’ve heard 
about him,” Kendrick said, trem- 



bling with hardly repressed ex- 
citement. 

What a correct attitude! Zen 
thought. One rarely finds such re- 
ligious respect among foreigners. 

“In fact, I’ve heard a great deal 
about him and I should like to 
know even more!” Kendrick 
spoke almost reverently. 

“He is an extremely interesting 
divinity,” the king replied com- 
placently. “And if your robot can- 
not teleport or requires a hand 
with the heavy work, do not hesi- 
tate to call on Zen the Accommo- 
dating. We’ll detail a priest to 
summon — ” 

“The robot manages very well 
all by itself, thank you,” Kendrick 
said quickly. 

TN HIS hideaway, the material 

body of Zen breathed a vast 
multiple sigh of relief. He was 
getting to like these Earthmen 
more and more by the minute. 

“Might I inquire,” the king 
asked, “into the nature of your 
researches?” 

“An investigation of the pre- 
valent nuclear ritual beliefs on 
Uxen in relation to the over-all 
matrix of social culture, and we 
really must get along and see to 
the unloading of the ship. Good- 
by, Your Majesty . Your Ex- 
cellency.” And Kendrick dragged 
his protesting aide off. 

“If only,” said the king, “I were 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



still an absolute monarch, I would 
teach these Earthlings some man- 
ners.” His face grew wistful. 
“Well I remember how my father 
would have those who crossed 
him torn apart by wild skwitch.” 
“If you did have the Earthlings 
torn apart by wild skwitch, Sire,” 
Guj pointed out, “then you would 
certainly never be able to obtain 
any information from them.” 
Uxlu sighed. “I would merely 
have them torn apart a little — 
just enough so that they would 
answer a few civil questions.” He 
sighed again. “And, supposing 
they did happen to — er — pass 
on, in the process, think of the 
tremendous lift to my ego. But 
nobody thinks of the king’s ego 
any more these days.” 

No, things were not what they 
had been since the time the plan- 
et had been retrieved by the 
Earthlings. They had not com- 
municated with Uxen for so many 
hundreds of years, they had ex- 
plained, because, after a more 
than ordinarily disastrous war, 
they had lost the secret of space 
travel for centuries. 

Now, wanting to make amends 
for those long years of neglect, 
they immediately provided that 
the Earth language and the Earth 
income tax become mandatory 
upon Uxen. The language was 
taught by recordings. Since the 
Uxenach were a highly intelligent 



people, they had all learned it 
quickly and forgotten most of 
their native tongue except for a 
few untranslatable concepts. 

“Must be a new secret atomic 
weapon they’re working on,” Ux- 
lu decided. “Why else should 
they come to such a remote cor- 
ner of the Galaxy? And you will 
recall that the older one — Ken- 
drick — said something about 
nuclear beliefs. If only we could 
discover what it is, secure it for 
ourselves, perhaps we could de- 
feat the Earthmen, drive them 
away — ” he sighed for the third 
time that morning — “and rule 
the planet ourselves.” 

J UST then the crown princess 
Iximi entered the throne room. 
Iximi really lived up to her title 
of Most Fair and Exalted, for 
centuries of selective breeding 
under which the kings of Uxen 
had seized the loveliest women 
of the planet for their wives had 
resulted in an outstanding pul- 
chritude. Her hair was as golden 
as the ripe fruit that bent the 
boughs of the iolo tree, and her 
eyes were bluer than the uriz 
stones on the belt girdling her 
slender waist. Reproductions of 
the famous portrait of her which 
hung in the great hall of the 
palace were very popular on 
calendars. 

“My father grieves,” she ob- 



THE PRINCESS AND THE PHYSICIST 



73 



served, making the secular xa. 
“Pray tell your unworthy daugh- 
ter what sorrow racks your noble 
bosom.” 

“Uxen is a backwash,” her 
father mourned. “A planet forgot- 
ten, while the rest of the Galaxy 
goes by. Our ego has reached its 
nadir.” 

“Why did you let yourself be 
conquered?” the princess retorted 
scornfully. “Ah, had I been old 
enough to speak then, matters 
would be very different today!” 
Although she seemed too beauti- 
ful to be endowed with brains, 
Iximi had been graduated from 
the Royal University with high 
honors. 

Zen the Erudite was particu- 
larly fond of her, for she had 
been his best student in Ad- 
vanced Theology. She was, more- 
over, an ardent patriot and lead- 
er of the underground Moolai 
(free) Uxen movement, with 
which Zen was more or less in 
sympathy, since he felt Uxen be- 
longed to him and not to the 
Earthlings. After all, he had been 
there first. 

“Let ourselves be conquered!” 
Her father’s voice rose to a 
squeak. “Let ourselves! Nobody 
asked us — we were conquered.” 

“True, But we could at least 
have essayed our strength against 
the conquerors instead of capitu- 
lating like yioch. We could have 

74 



fought to the last man!” 

“A woman is always ready to 
fight to the last man,” Guj com- 
mented. 

“Did you hear that, ancient 
and revered parent! He called 
me, a princess of the blood, a — 
a woman!” 

“We are all equal before Zen,” 
Guj said sententiously, making 
the high xa. 

“Praise Zen,” Uxlu and Iximi 
chanted perfunctorily, bowing 
low. 

Iximi, still angry, ordered Guj 
— who was also high priest — to 
start services. Kindling the in- 
cense in the hajen, he began the 
chant. 

Of course it was his holiday, 
but Zen couldn’t resist the appeal 
of the incense. Besides he was 
there an3rway, so it was really no 
trouble, no trouble, he thought, 
greedily sniffing the delicious 
aroma, af all. He materialized a 
head with seven nostrils so that 
he was able to inhale the incense 
in one delectable gulp. Then, “No 
prayers answered on Thursday,” 
he said, and disappeared. That 
would show them! 

“Drat Zen and his days off!” 
The princess was in a fury. “Very 
well, we’ll manage without Zen 
the Spiteful. Now, precisely what 
is troubling you, worthy and un- 
deservedly Honored Parent?” 

“Those two scientists who ar- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rived from Earth. Didn’t you 
meet them when you came in?” 
“No, Respected Father,” she 
said, sitting on the arm of the 
throne. “I must have just missed 
them. What are they like?” 

H e told her what they were 
like in terms not even a 
monarch should use before his 
daughter. “And these squuch,” 
he concluded, “are undoubtedly 
working on a secret weapon. If 
we had it, we could free Uxen.” 
“Moolai Uxen!” the princess 
shouted, standing up. “My friends, 
must we continue to submit to 
the yoke of the tyrant? Arise. 
Smite the . .” 

“Anyone,” said Guj, “can make 
a speech.” 

The princess sat on the steps 
of the throne and pondered. “Ob- 
viously we must introduce a spy 
into their household to learn their 
science and turn it to our advan- 
tage.” 

“They are very careful, those 
Earthlings,” Guj informed her 
superciliously. “It is obvious that 
they do not intend to let any of 
us come near them.” 

The princess gave a knowing 
smile. “But they undoubtedly will 
need at least one menial to care 
for their dwelling. I shall be that 
menial. I, Iximi, will so demean 
myself for the sake of my planet! 
Moolai Uxen!” 



“You cannot do it, Iximi,” her 
father said, distressed. “You must 
not defile yourself so. I will not 
hear of it!” 

“And besides,” Guj interposed, 
“they will need no servants. All 
their housework is to be done by 
their robot — a mechanical man 
that performs all menial duties. 
And you. Your Royal Highness, 
could not plausibly disguise your- 
self as a machine.” 

“No-o-o-o, I expect not.” The 
princess hugged the rosy knees 
revealed by her brief tunic and 
thought aloud, “But . .• . just . 
supposing . something . went 
wrong with the robot. They do 
not possess another?” 

“They referred only to one. 
Highness,” Guj replied reluctant- 
ly. “But they may have the parts 
with which to construct another.” 
“Nonetheless, it is well worth 
the attempt,” the princess de- 
clared. “You will cast a spell on 
the robot, Guj, so that it stops.” 
He sighed. “Very well. Your 
Highness; I suppose I could man- 
age that!” 

Making the secular xa, he left 
the royal pair. Outside, his voice 
could be heard bellowing in the 
anteroom, “Has any one of you 
squuch seen my pliers?” 

“There is no need for worry. 
Venerated Ancestor,” the prin- 
cess assured the monarch. “All- 



THE PRINCESS AND THE PHYSICIST 



75 



Helpful Zen will aid me with my 
tasks.” 

Far away in his arcane retreat, 
the divinity groaned to himself. 

A NOTHER aspect of Zen’s 
personality followed the two 
Earthmen as they left the palace 
to supervise the erection of their 
prefab by the crew of the space- 
ship in one of the Royal Parks. 
A vast crowd of Uxenach gath- 
ered to watch the novelty, and 
among them there presently ap- 
peared a sinister-looking old man 
with a red beard, whom Zen the 
Pansophic had no difficulty in 
recognizing as the prime minis- 
ter, heavily disguised. Of course 
it would have been no trouble for 
Zen to carry out Guj’s mission 
for him, but he believed in self- 
help — especially on Thursdays. 

“You certainly fixed us up 
fine!” Hammond muttered disre- 
spectfully to the professor. “You 
should’ve told the king we were 
inventing a vacuum cleaner or 
something. Now they’ll just be 
more curious than ever. And I 
still don’t see why you refused 
the priest. Seems to me he’d be 
just what you needed.” 

“Yes, and the first to catch on 
to why we’re here. We mustn’t 
antagonize the natives; these 
closed groups are so apt to resent 
any investigation into their 
mythos.” 

76 



“If it’s all mythical, why do 
you need a scientist then?” 

“A physical scientist, you 
mean,” Kendrick said austerely. 
“For anthropology is a science, 
too, you know.” 

Peter snorted. 

“Some Earthmen claim actual- 
ly to have seen these alleged 
manifestations,” Kendrick went 
on to explain, “in which case 
there must be some kind of me- 
chanical trickery involved — 
which is where you come in. Of 
course I would have preferred an 
engineer to help me, but you 
were all I could get from the 
government.” 

“And you wouldn’t have got 
me either, if the Minister of Sci- 
ence didn’t have it in for me!” 
Peter said irately. “I’m far too 
good for this piddling little job, 
and you know it. If it weren’t for 
envy in high places — ” 

“Better watch out,” the profes- 
sor warned, “or the Minister 
might decide you’re too good for 
science altogether, and you’ll be 
switched to a position more in 
keeping with your talents — say, 
as a Refuse Removal Agent.” 
And what is wrong with the 
honored art of Refuse Removal? 
Zen wondered. There were a lot 
of mystifying things about these 
Earthmen. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



HE scientists’ quaint little 
edifice was finally set up, and 
the spaceship took its departure. 
It was only then that the Earth- 
men discovered that something 
they called cigarettes couldn’t be 
found in the welter of packages, 
and that the robot wouldn’t cook 
dinner or, in fact, do anything. 
Good old Guj, Zen thought. 

“I can’t figure out what’s gone 
wrong,” Peter complained, as he 
finished putting the mechanical 
man together again. “Everything 
seems to be all right, and yet the 
damned thing won’t function.” 
“Looks as if we’ll have to do 
the housework ourselves, con- 
found it!” 

“Uh-uh,” Peter said. “You can, 
but not me. The Earth govern- 
ment put me under your orders 
so far as this project is concerned, 
sir, but I’m not supposed to do 
anything degrading, sir, and men- 
ial work is classified as just that, 
sir, so — ” 

“All right, all right!” Kendrick 
said. “Though it seems to me if 
I’m willing to do it, you should 
have no objection.” 

“It’s your project, sir. I gath- 
ered from the king, though,” Peter 
added more helpfully, “that some 
of the natives still do menial la- 
bor themselves.” 

“How disgusting that there 
should still be a planet so back- 
ward that human beings should 



be forced to do humiliating 
tasks,” Kendrick said. 

You don’t know the half of it, 
either, Zen thought, shocked all 
the way back to his physical be- 
ing. It had never occurred to him 
that the functions qf gods on 
other planets might be different 
than on Uxen . unless the 
Earthlings failed to pay rever- 
ence to their own gods, which 
seemed unlikely in view of the 
respectful way with which Pro- 
fessor Kendrick had greeted the 
mention of Zen’s Awe-Inspiring 
Name. Then Refuse Removal 
was not necessarily a divine pre- 
rogative. 

Those first colonists were very 
clever, Zen thought bitterly, 
sweet-talking me into becoming 
a god and doing all their dirty 
work. I was happy here as the 
Only Inhabitant; why did I ever 
let those interlopers involve me 
in Theolatry? But I can’t quit 
now. The Uxenach need Me . 
and I need incense; I’m fettered 
by my own weakness. Still, I have 
the glimmerings of an idea. 

“Oh, how much could a half- 
witted menial find out?” Peter 
demanded. “Remember, it’s either 
a native servant, sir, or you do 
the housework yourself.” 

“All right,” Kendrick agreed 
gloomily. “We’ll try one of the 
natives.” 



THE PRINCESS AND THE PHYSICIST 



77 



Co THE next day, still attend- 
^ ed by the Unseen Presence of 
Zen, they sought audience with 
the prime minister. 

“Welcome, Earthmen, to the 
humble apartments of His Maj- 
esty’s most unimportant subject,” 
Guj greeted them, making a very 
small xa as he led them into the 
largest reception room. 

Kendrick absently ran his fin- 
ger over the undercarving of a 
small gold table. “Look, no dust,” 
he whispered. “Must have excel- 
lent help here.” 

Zen couldn’t help preening just 
a bit. At least he did his work 
well; no one could gainsay that. 

“Your desire,” Guj went on, 
apparently anxious to get to the 
point, “is my command. Would 
you like a rojh of dancing girls 
to perform before you or — ?” 
“The king said something yes- 
terday about servants’ being 
available,” Kendrick interrupted. 
“And our robot seems to have 
broken down. Could you tell us 
where we could get someone to 
do our housework?” 

An expression of vivid pleasure 
illuminated the prime minister’s 
venerable countenance. “By for- 
tunate chance, gentlemen, a small 
lot of maids is to be auctioned off 
at a village very near the Im- 
perial City tomorrow. I should be 
delighted to escort you there per- 
sonally.” 



“Auctioned?” Kendrick repeat- 
ed. “You mean they sell servants 
here?” 

Guj raised his snowy eyebrows. 
“Sold? Certainly not; they are 
leased for two years apiece. After 
all, if you have no lease, what 
guarantee do you have that your 
servants will stay after you have 
trained them? None whatsoever.” 

When the two scientists had 
gone, Iximi emerged from behind 
a bright-colored tapestry depict- 
ing Zen in seven hundred and 
fifty-three of his Attributes. 

“The younger one is not at all 
bad-lookihg,” she commented, 
patting her hair into place. “I do 
like big blond men. Perhaps my 
task will not be as unpleasant as 
I fancied.” 

Guj stroked his beard. “How 
do you know the Earthlings will 
select you, Your Highness? Many 
other maids will be auctioned off 
at the same time.” 

The princess stiffened angrily. 
“They’ll pick me or they’ll never 
leave Uxen alive and you. Your 
Excellency, would not outlive 
them.” 

A LTHOUGH it meant he had 
to overwork the other aspects 
of his multiple personality, Zen 
kept one free so that the next 
day he could join the Earthmen 
— in spirit, that .was — on their 
excursion in search of a menial. 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“If, as an anthropologist, you 
are interested in local folkways. 
Professor,” Guj remarked gra- 
ciously, as he and the scientists 
piled into a scarlet, boat-shaped 
vehicle, “you will find much to 
attract your attention in this 
quaint little planet of ours.” 

“Are the eyes painted on front 
of the car to ward off demons?” 
Kendrick asked. 

“Car? Oh, you mean the yio!” 
Guj patted the forepart of the 
vehicle. It purred and fluttered 
long eyelashes. “We breed an es- 
pecially bouncy strain with seats; 
they’re so much more comfort- 
able, you know.” 

“You mean this is a live ani- 
mal?” 

Guj nodded apologetically. “Of 
course it does not go very fast. 
Now if we had the atomic power 
drive, such as your spaceships 
have — ” 

“You’d shoot right off into 
space,” Hammond assured him. 

“Speed,” said Kendrick, “is the 
curse of modern civilization. Be 
glad you still retain some of the 
old-fashioned graces here on 
Uxen. You see,” he whispered to 
his assistant, “a clear case of 
magicp-religious culture-freezing, 
resulting in a static society un- 
able to advance itself, comes of 
its implicit reliance upon the 
powers of an omnipotent deity.” 
Zen took some time to figure 



this out. But that’s right! he con- 
cluded, in surprise. 

“I thought your god teleported 
things?” Peter asked Guj. “How 
come he doesn’t teleport you 
around, if you’re in such a hurry 
to go places?” 

Kendrick glared at him. 
“Please remember that I’m the 
anthropologist,” he hissed. “You 
have got to know how to describe 
the Transcendental Personality 
with the proper respect.” 

‘We don’t have Zen teleport 
animate objects,” the prime min- 
ister explained affably. “Or even 
inanimate ones if they are fragile. 
For He tends to lose His Temper 
sometimes when He feels that 
He is overworked — ” Feels, in- 
deed! Zen said to himself — “and 
throws things about. We cannot 
reprove Him for His misbehavior. 
After all, a god is a god.” 

“The apparent irreverence,” 
Kendrick explained in an under- 
tone, “undoubtedly signifies that 
he is dealing with ancillary or, 
perhaps, peripheral religious be- 
liefs. I must make a note of 
them.” He did so. 

B y the time the royal yio 
had arrived at the village 
where the planetary auctions for 
domestics were held, the maids 
were already arranged in a row 
on the platform. Most were de- 
pressingly plain creatures and

79 




dressed in thick sacklike tunics. 
Among them, the graceful form 
of Iximi was conspicuous, clad in 
a garment similar in cut but fash- 
ioned of translucent gauze al- 
most as blue as her eyes. 

Peter straightened his tie and 
assumed a much more cheerful 
expression. “Let’s rent that one!” 
he exclaimed, pointing to the 
princess. 

“Nonsense!” Kendrick told 
him. “In the first place, she is ob- 
viously the most expensive 
model. Secondly, she would be 



too distracting for you. And, fi- 
nally, a pretty girl is never as 
good a worker as a plain ... We’ll 
take that one.” The professor 
pointed to the dumpiest and old- 
est of the women. “How much 
should I offer to start. Your Ex- 
cellency? No sense beginning the 
bidding too high. We Earthmen 
aren’t made of money, in spite of 
what the rest of the Galaxy seems 
to think.” 

“A hundred credits is stand- 
ard,” Guj murmured. “However, 
sir, there is one problem — have 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




you considered how you are go- 
ing to communicate with your 
maid?” 

“Communicate? Are they 
mutes?” 

“No, but very few of these 
women speak Earth.” A look of 
surprise flitted over the faces of 
the servants, vanishing as her 
royal highness glared at them. 

Kendrick pursed thin lips. “I 
was under the impression that 
the Earth language was manda- 
tory on Uxen.” 

“Oh, it is; it is, indeed!” Guj 



said hastily. “However, it is so 
hard to teach these backward 
peasants new ways.” One of the 
backward peasants gave a loud 
sniff, which changed to a squeal 
as she was honored with a pinch 
from the hand of royalty. “But 
you will not betray us? We are 
making rapid advances and be- 
fore long we hope to make Earth 
universal.” 

“Of course we won’t,” Peter 
put in, before Kendrick had a 
chance to reply. “What’s more, I 
don’t see why the Uxenians 



THE PRINCESS AND THE PHYSICIST 



81 



shouldn’t be allowed to speak 
their own language.” 

The princess gave him a daz- 
zling smile. “Moolai Uxen! We 
must not allow the beautiful 
Uxulk tongue to fall into desue- 
tude. Bring back our lovely lan- 
guage!” 

Guj gestured desperately. She 
tossed her head, but stopped. 

“Please, Kendrick,” Peter beg- 
ged, “we’ve got to buy that one!” 
“Certainly not. You can see 
she’s a troublemaker. Do you 
speak Earth?” the professor de- 
manded of the maid he had 
chosen. 

“No speak,” she replied. 

Peter tugged at his superior’s 
sleeve. “That one speaks Earth.” 
Kendrick shook him off. “Do 
you speak Earth?” he demanded 
of the second oldest and ugliest. 
She shook her head. The others 
went through the same proce- 
dure. 

“It looks,” Peter said, grinning, 
“as if we’ll have to take mine.” 

“I suppose so,” Kendrick 
agreed gloomily, “but somehow I 
feel no good will come of this.” 
Zen wondered whether Earth- 
men had powers of precognition. 

No one bid against them, so 
they took a two-year lease on the 
crown princess for the very rea- 
sonable price of a hundred cred- 
its, and drove her home with 
them.

Iximi gazed at the little prefab 
with disfavor. “But why are we 
halting outside this gluu hutch, 
masters?” 

Guj cleared his throat. “Sirs, 
I wish you joy.” He made the 
secular xa. “Should you ever be 
in need again, do not hesitate to 
get in touch with me at the pal- 
ace.” And, climbing into the yio, 
he was off. 

^^HE others entered the small 
dwelling. “That little trip cer- 
tainly gave me an appetite,” Ken- 
drick said, rubbing his hands to- 
gether. “Iximi, you had better 
start lunch right away. This is 
the kitchen.” 

Iximi gazed around the cubi- 
cle with disfavor. “Truly it is not 
much,” she observed. “However, 
masters, if you will leave me, I 
shall endeavor to do my poor 
best.” 

“Let me show you — ” Peter 
began, but Kendrick interrupted. 

“Leave the girl alone, Ham- 
mond. She must be able to cook, 
if she’s a professional servant. 
We’ve wasted the whole morning 
as it is; maybe we can get some- 
thing done before lunch.” 

Iximi closed the door, got out 
her portable altar — all members 
of the royal family were qualified 
members of the priesthood, 
though they seldom practiced — 
and in a low voice, for the door

and walls were thin, summoned 
Zen the All-Capable. 

The god sighed as he material- 
ized his head. “I might have 
known you would require Me. 
What is your will, oh Most Fair?” 

“I have been ordered to pre- 
pare the strangers’ midday re- 
past, oh Puissant One, and I 
know not what to do with all this 
ukh, which they assure me is 
their food.” And she pointed 
scornfully to the cans and jars 
and packages. 

“How should / know then?” 
Zen asked unguardedly. 

The princess looked at him. 
“Surely Zen the All-Knowing 
jests?” 

“Er — yes. Merely having My 
Bit of Fun, you know.” He hastily 
inspected the exterior of the al- 
leged foods. “There appear to be 
legends inscribed upon the con- 
tainers. Perchance, were we to 
read them, they might give a clue 
as to their contents.” 

“Oh, Omniscent One,” the prin- 
cess exclaimed, “truly You are 
Wise and Sapient indeed, and it 
is I who was the fool to have 
doubted for so much as an in- 
stant.” 

“Oh you doubted, did you?” 
Terrible Zen frowned terribly. 
“Well, see that it doesn’t happen 
again.” He had no intention of 
losing his divine authority at this 
stage of the game. 



“Your Will is mine, All-Wise 
One. And I think You had best 
materialize a few pair of arms as 
well as Your August and Awe- 
Inspiring Countenance, for there 
is much work to be done.” 

S INCE the partitions were thin, 
Zen and the princess could 
hear most of the conversation in 
the main room. “. First thing 
to do,” Kendrick’s voice remark- 
ed, “is find out whether we’re per- 
mitted to attend one of their re- 
ligious ceremonies, where Zen is 
said to manifest himself actually 
and not, it is contended, just sym- 
bolically. .” 

“The stove is here. Almighty,” 
the princess suggested, “not 
against the door where you are 
pressing Your Divine Ear.” 

“Shhh. What I hear is fraught 
with import for the future of the 
planet. Moolai Uxen.” 

“Moolai Uxen,” the princess 
replied automatically. 

“. I wonder how hard it’ll be 
to crash the services,” Kendrick 
went on. “Most primitives don’t 
like outsiders present at their 
ritual activities.” 

“Especially if there are actual 
manifestations of their god,” 
Hammond contributed. “That 
would mean the priests are up to 
some sort of trickery, and they 
wouldn’t care to run the risk of 
having us see through — ”

He was interrupted by a loud 
crash from the kitchen. 

“Are you all right, Iximi!” he 
yelled. “Need any help?” 

“All is well!” she called back. 
“But, I pray you, do not enter, 
masters. The reverberation was 
part of a rite designed to deflect 
evil spirits from the food. Were 
a heretic to be present or inter- 
rupt the ceremonies, the spell 
would be voided and the food 
contaminated.” 

“Okay!” Peter returned and, in 
a lower tone, which he probably 
thought she could not overhear, 
“Seems you were right.” 

“Naturally.” There was com- 
placency in the professor’s voice. 
“And now let us consider the 
validating features of the social 
structure as related to the m3rthos 

— and, of course, the ethos, where 
the two are not coincident — of 
the Uxenians. .” 

“Imagine,” Zen complained in 
the kitchen, “accusing Me of be- 
ing a mere trick of the priesthood 

— Supreme Me!” , 

“Supreme Butterfingers!” the 

princess snapped, irritation driv- 
ing her to the point of sacrilege. 
“You spilled that red stuff, the 
. .” she bent over to read the 
legend on the container “. the 
ketchup all over the floor!” 

“The floor is relatively clean,” 
Zen murmured abstractedly. “We 
can scoop up the substance and 



incorporate it in whatever dainty 
dish we prepare for the Earth- 
lings’ repast. Now they’ll think 
that I, Zen the Accessible, am 
difficult to have audience with,” 
he mourned, “whereas I was par- 
ticularly anxious to hold con- 
verse with them and discover 
what quest brings them to Uxen. 
That is,” he added hastily, re- 
membering he was omniscient, 
“just how they would justify its 
rationale.” 

“Shall we get on with our cul- 
inary activities. Almighty One?” 
Iximi asked coldly. 

If the Most Fair and Exalted 
had a flaw, Zen thought, it was a 
one-track mind. 



44 V|^HAT in hell did you put 
” in this, Iximi?” Kendrick 
demanded, after one taste of the 
steaming casserole of food which 
she had set proudly before the 
two Earthmen. 

“Ketchup, that’s for sure. .” 
Peter murmured, rolling a mouth- 
ful around his tongue as he 
sought to separate its component 
flavors. “And rhubarb, I should 
say.” 

“Dried fish and garlic. .” Ken- 
drick made further identifica- 
tions. 

“And a comestible called 
marshmallow,” Iximi beamed. 
“You like it? I am so glad!” 

“I do not — ” Kendrick began. 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but Peter intervened. 

“It’s very nice, Iximi,” he said 
tactfully, “but I guess we’re just 
used to old run-of-the-mill Earth 
cooking. It’s all our fault; we 
should have given you a recipe.” 
“I had a recipe,” Iximi re- 
turned. “It came to me by Divine 
Inspiration.” 

Kendrick compressed his lips. 
“Useful sort of divinity they 
have around here,” Peter said. 
“Everything that goes wrong 
seems to take place in the name 
of religion. Are you sure you 
didn’t happen to overhear us talk- 
ing before, Iximi?” 

“Don’t be silly, Hammond!” 
Kendrick snapped. “These simple 
primitives do not have the sophis- 
tication to use their religious be- 
liefs consciously as rationaliza- 
tion for their incompetence.” 
“Even had I wished to eaves- 
drop,” Iximi said haughtily, “I 
would hardly have had the op- 
portunity; I was too busy trying 
to prepare a palatable repast for 
you and — ” her voice broke — 
“you didn’t like it.” 

“Oh, I did like it, Iximi!” Peter 
protested. “It’s just that I’m al- 
lergic to rhubarb.” 

“Wait!” she-exclaimed, smiling 
again. “For dessert I have an es- 
pecial surprise for you.” She 
brought in a dish triumphantly. 
“Is this not just how you have it 
on Earth?” 



“Stewed cigarettes with whip- 
ped cream,” Kendrick muttered. 
“Stewed cigarettes! Where on 
Ear — on Uxen did you find 
them?” 

“In a large box with the other 
puddings,” she beamed. “Is it not 
highly succulent and flavorful?” 

The two scientists sprang from 
their chairs and dashed into the 
kitchen. Iximi stared after them. 
When they returned, they looked 
much more cheerful. They seated 
themselves, and soon fragrant 
clouds of smoke began to curl 
toward the ceiling. 

They are calling me at last, 
Zen thought happily, and with 
such delightful incense! Who * 
wants chants anyway? 

“But what are you doing!” the 
princess shrieked. 

•^EN hastened to manifest him- 
^ self, complete with fourteen 
nostrils, before she could spoil 
everything. “The procedure is 
most unorthodox,” he murmured 
aloud, “but truly this new in- 
cense has a most delicious aroma, 
extremely pleasing to My Ego. 
What is your will, oh, strangers?” 

“All-Merciful Zen,” the prin- 
cess pleaded, “forgive them, for 
they knew not what they did. 
They did not mean to summon 
You.” 

“Then who,” asked Zen in a 
terrible voice, “is this wonderful

smoke for? Some foreign god 
whom they worship on My Terri- 
tory?” And he wouldn’t put it 
past them either. 

Peter looked at the anthropolo- 
gist, but Kendrick was obviously 
too paralyzed with fright to 
speak. “As a matter of fact, Your 
— er — Omnipotence,” the phy- 
sicist said haltingly, “this is not 
part of our religious ritual. We 
burn this particular type of in- 
cense which we call tobacco, for 
our own pleasure.” 

“In other words,” Zen said 
coldly, “you worship yourselves. 
I work and slave My Godhood 
to the bone only to have egotists 
running all over My Planet.” 
“No, it’s nothing like that at 
all,” Kendrick quavered. “We 
smoke the tobacco to — well — 
gratify our appetites. Like — like 
eating, you know.” 

“Well, you will have to forego 
that pleasure,” Zen said, frown- 
ing terribly. Even the tall one 
cowered, he noted with apprecia- 
tion. It had been a long time 
since people had really cringed 
before his frown. The Uxenach 
had come to take him too much 
for granted; they would learn 
their mistake. “From now on,” he 
said portentously, “the tobacco 
must be reserved for My Use 
alone. Smoke it only for purposes 
of worship. Once a day will be 
sufficient,” he added graciously, 



“and perhaps twice on holy days.” 
“But we do not worship alien 
gods,” Kendrick persisted in a 
shaky voice. “Even if you were 
a god. .” 

Zen frowned. “Would you care 
to step outside and test my divin- 
ity?” 

“Well, no ... but . .” 

“Then, as far as you’re con- 
cerned, I am Divine, and let’s 
have no more quibbling. Don’t 
forget the tobacco once a day. 
About time I had a change from 
that low-grade incense.”

He vanished. Too late he re- 
membered that he’d planned to 
ask the Earthlings why they had 
come to Uxen, and to discuss a 
little business proposition with 
them. Oh, well, time for that at 
his next materialization for them. 
And, now that he considered the 
matter, the direct approach might 
very well be a mistake. 

He hoped Iximi would make 
sure they burned him tobacco 
regularly — really good stuff; al- 
most made godhood worthwhile. 
But then he’d felt that way about 



incense at first. No, he had other 
ideas for making divinity worth- 
while, and Iximi was going to 
help him, even if she didn’t know 
it. People had used him long 
enough; it was his turn to use 
them. 

TN THE kitchen, Iximi recalled 

Zen and together they washed 
the dishes and listened to the 
scientists quarreling in the next 
room. 

“You will note the use of in- 
cense as standard socio-religious

parallelism, Hammond. Men have 
appetites that must be gratified 
and so they feel their supreme 
being must also eat . only, be- 
ing a deity, he consumes aromas.” 

“Yes,” Peter said. “You ex- 
plained all that to Him much 
more succinctly, though.” 

“Hah! Well, have you any idea 
yet as to how the trick was 
worked?” 

“Worked? What do you 
mean?” 

“How they made that talking 
image appear? Clever device, I 
must say, although the Scoomps 
of Aldebaran III — ” 

“Didn’t look like a trick to me.” 

“That’s a fine young man,” Zen 
said approvingly to Iximi. “I like 
him.” 

“You really do, Most High? I 
am so glad!” 

“You don’t mean you really 
believe this Zen is an actual liv- 
ing god?” Kendrick spluttered. 

There was a silence. “No, not 
a god,” Peter said finally, “but 
not a human, either. Perhaps an- 
other life-form with attributes 
different from ours. After all, do 
we know who or what was on 
Uxen, before it was colonized by 
Earth?” 

“Tcha!” Kendrick said. 

Iximi looked at Zen. Zen 
looked at Iximi. “The concept of 
godhood varies from society to 
society,” the divinity told the 



princess. “Peter is not being sac- 
rilegious, just manifesting a 
healthy skepticism.” 

“You’re a credulous fool,” Ken- 
drick said hotly to his assistant. 
“I don’t blame the Secretary for 
demoting you. When we return 
to Earth, I shall recommend your 
transfer to Refuse Removal. You 
have no business at all in Sci- 
ence!” 

There was the sound of foot- 
steps. “Leaving , my noxious com- 
pany?” Peter’s voice asked tight- 
ly- 

“I am going out to the nearest 
temple to have a chat with one 
of the priests. I can expect more 
sensible answers from him than 
from you!” The outside door 
slammed. 

“Speaking of Refuse Removal, 
Almighty,” Iximi said to Zen, 
“would you teleport the remains 
of this miserable repast to the 
Sacred Garbage Dump? And you 
need not return; I’ll be able to 
handle the rest myself.” 

“Moolai Uxen,” Zen reminded 
her and vanished with the gar- 
bage, but, although the refuse 
was duly teleported, the unseen, 
impalpable presence of the god 
remained. 

T he door to the kitchen 
opened, and Hammond walk- 
ed in, his face grim. “Need any 
help, Iximi?” he asked, not very 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



graciously. “Or should I say ‘Your 
Royal Highness’?” 

Iximi dropped a plate which, 
fortunately, was plastic. “How 
did you know who I was?” 

He sat down on a stool. “Didn’t 
you remember that your portrait 
hung in the great hall of the 
palace?” 

“Of course,” she said, cha- 
grined. “A portrait of a servant 
would hardly be hung there.” 
“Not only that, but I asked 
whom it depicted. Do you think 
I wouldn’t notice the picture of 
such a beautiful girl?” 

“But if you knew, why then 
did you. ?” 

He grinned. “I realized you 
were up to no good, and I have 
no especial interest in the success 
of Kendrick’s project.” 

Iximi carefully dried a dish. 
“And what is his project?” 

“To investigate the mythos of 
the allegedly corporeal divinity 
in static primitive societies, with 
especial reference to the god-con- 
cept of Zen on Uxen.” 

“Is that all?" 

All! Zen thought. Sounds like 
an excellent subject for research 
to me. Unfortunate that I cannot 
possibly let the study be com- 
pleted, as I am going to invali- 
date the available data very 
shortly. 

“That’s all, Iximi.” 

“And how is it that Professor 



Kendrick did not recognize me 
from the picture?” 

“Oh, he never notices girls’ pic- 
tures. He’s a complete idiot. 
You overheard us just now? 
When we get back to Earth, I’m 
going to be a garbage collector.” 
“Here on Uxen, Refuse Re- 
moval is a Divine Prerogative,” 
Iximi remarked. 

“Poor Zen, whatever he is,” 
Peter said to himself. “But a god, 
being a god,” he went on in a 
louder voice, “can raise himself 
above the more sordid aspects of 
the job. As a mere human, I can- 
not. Iximi, I wonder if. .” He 
looked nervously at his watch. 
“I hope Kendrick takes his time.” 
“He will not return soon,” 
Iximi told him, putting away the 
dish towel. “Not if he is deter- 
mined to find a temple. Because 
there are no temples. Zen is a 
god of the Hearth and Home.” 
“Iximi,” Peter said, getting up 
and coming closer to her, “isn’t 
there some way I can stay here 
on Uxen, some job I can fill? 
You’re the crown princess — you 
must have a drag with the civil 
service.” He looked at her long- 
ingly. “Oh, if only you weren’t 
so far above me in rank.” 

“Listen, Peter!” She caught his 
hands. “If you were the Royal 
Physicist, our ranks would not be 
so far disparate. My distinguished

father would make you a dxike. 
And princesses have often . 
she blushed . that is to say, 
dukes are considered quite eligi- 
ble.” 

“Do you think I have a chance 
of becoming Royal Physicist?” 

“I am certain of it.” She came 
very close to him. “You could 
give us the atomic drive, design 
space ships . weapons . for 
us, couldn’t you, darling?” 

“I could.” He looked troubled. 
“But it’s one thing to become an 
extraterrestrial, another to betray 
my own world.” 

Iximi put her arms around 
him. “But Uxen will be your 
world, Peter. As prince consort, 
you would no longer be con- 
cerned with the welfare of the 
Earthlings.” 

“Yes, but . .” 

“And where is there betrayal? 
We do not seek to conquer Earth 
or its colonies. All we want is to 
regain our own freedom. We are 
entitled to freedom, aren’t we, 
Peter?” 

He nodded slowly. “I . sup- 
pose so.” 

“Moolai Uxen.” She thrust a 
package of cigarettes into his 
hand. “Let us summon the Al- 
mighty One to bless our betroth- 
al.” 

Peter obediently lit two cigar- 
ettes and gave one to her.

Z EN materialized his head. 

“Blessings on you, my chil- 
dren,” he said, sniffing ecstatic- 
ally, “and welcome. Holy Chief 
Physicist, to My Service.” 

“Royal Chief Physicist,” Iximi 
corrected. 

“No, that is insufficient for his 
merits. Holy and Sacrosanct 
Chief Physicist is what he will 
be, with the rank of prince. You 
will have the honor of serving 
Terrible Zen Myself, Peter Ham- 
mond.” 

“Delighted,” said the young 
man dubiously. 

“You will construct robots that 
do housework, vehicles that carry 
refuse to the Sacred Garbage 
Dump, vans that transport house- 
hold goods, machines that lave 
dishes. .” 

“Will do,” Peter said with ob- 
vious relief. “And may I say. Your 
— er — Benignness, that it will 
be a pleasure to serve You?” 

“But the atomic power drive 
. freedom?” Iximi stammered. 

“These will point the surer, 
shorter way to the true freedom. 
My Omnidynamism has stood in 
the way of your cultural advance- 
ment, as Professor Kendrick will 
undoubtedly be delighted to ex- 
plain to you.” 

“But, Your Omnipotence. .” 
“Let us have no more discus- 
sion. I am your God and I know 
best.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Yes, Supreme One,” Iximi 
said sullenly. 

“You Uxenach have kept Me 
so busy for thousands of years, I 
have had no time for My Divine 
Meditations. I shall now with- 
draw Myself from mundane af- 
fairs.” 

The princess forgot disappoint- 
ment in anxiety. “You will not 
leave us, Zen?” 

“No, My child, I shall be al- 
ways present, watching over My 
People, guiding them, ready to 
help them in case of emergency. 
But make sure I am not sum- 
moned save in case of dire need. 
No more baby-sitting, mind you.” 
“Yes, Almighty One.” 

“The incense will continue to 
be offered to me daily by every- 
one who seeks My Sacred Ear, 
and make sure to import a large 
quantity of this tobacco from 
Earth for holy days . and other 
occasions,” he added casually, 
“when you wish to be especially 
sure of incurring My Divine 
Favor. And I wish to be worship- 
ped in temples like other gods.” 
Less chance of my being stuck 
with some unexpected household 
task. “I shall manifest Myself on 
Thursdays only,” he concluded 
gleefully, struck by the consum- 
mate idea. “Thursday will be My 
Day to work and your holy day. 
All other days you will work, and 
I will indulge in Divine Medita- 



tion. I have spoken.” 

And he withdrew all aspects of 
his personality to his retreat to 
wallow in the luxury of six days 
off per week. Naturally, to make 
sure the Uxenach kept the in- 
cense up to scratch, he would 
perform a small miracle now and 
again to show he was still Omni- 
present. 

Being a god, he thought as he 
made himself more comfortable, 
was not a bad thing at all. One 
merely needed to learn how to 
go about it in the right way.

for your information 




By WILLY LEY 

KONSTANTIN ANKLITZEN 
ALIAS FRIAR BERTHOLDUS 

T he city chronicle of a 
West German city — 
Ulm, if I remember cor- 
rectly — contains a simply won- 
derful entry, written by an un- 
known hand around the year 
1380. It reads: “A knight came 
and besieged the town and shot 
at it with thunder guns. It did 
no harm.” 

There are several things about 
this short entry that I find in- 
teresting. 

One is that the knight who be- 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sieged the town was not even 
mentioned by name, apparently 
a little siege now and then being 
quite commonplace. I have the 
feeling that this one may not 
have been mentioned at all if it 
had not been for the thunder gun. 

The second interesting point 
is, of course, that it was the 
knight who sported the thunder 
gun and not the city. The cus- 
tomary explanation is that the 
knights were opposed to firearms 
as a principle of knightly honor. 
Though their reasoning may have 
been faulty, they at least alleged- 
ly displayed good judgment be- 
cause firearms supposedly ended 
knighthood. Well, the firearms 
did contribute at a later date, 
when they had grown into siege 
guns, but even then mostly for 
the reason that the rich cities 
could afford siege guns while the 
knights could not. 

T he third interesting point is 
that this ineffective shooting 
took place in the very year in 
which, according to an en- 
trenched belief, bolstered by a 
load of old books and manu- 
scripts, guns and gunpowder 
were invented by the monk Ber- 
thold Schwarz, who was a mem- 
ber of a monastery in or near the 
city of Freiburg in the Breisgau. 

Many of the manuscripts sol- 
emnly added that “said Berthold 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



was executed from life to death 
because of his invention of this 
art in 1388 A.D.” ^ after which 
they proceeded without notice- 
able scruples to teach appren- 
tices how to purify saltpeter, mix 
gunpowder and cast cannon. 

But when the city of Freiburg 
erected a monument to the in- 
ventor in somewhat belated rec- 
ognition of the passing of five 
centuries since his deed, the City 
Council, after careful delibera- 
tion and much correspondence 
with historical societies, had the 
year 1354 engraved as the year 
of his death on the pedestal of 
his monument. 

Since Arabic manuscripts speak 
of powder and of rockets more 
than a century before 1380, and 
since Roger Bacon’s famous let- 
ter in which he defended himself 
against the accusation of witch- 
craft is of equal age, and since 
the oldest picture of what is in- 
dubitably a firearm dates back to 
1326, there was evidently some- 
thing wrong with the story. 

Either the mysterious monk 
did not live at the time men- 
tioned in the old manuscripts, or 
else he was simply a legend and 
the statement that his name had 
been Konstantin Anklitzen be- 
fore he joined a monastic order 
had been invented by a local his- 
torian of Freiburg at an early 
time because this and similar 

93 



names were peculiar to the Frei- 
burg area. 

Whether “Berthold Schwarz” 
should be considered as “Man or 
Myth?” was quite an issue for 
decades among historians, espe- 
cially the military variety. While 
his supposed native city spent 
money on a public monument, a 
Royal Historical Commission 
which compiled a comprehensive 
Biographical Encyclopedia (the 
Allgemeine Deutsche Biogtaphie ) 
of all famous Germans resolved 
not to include him as being “un- 
historical.” 

Remains of this disagreement 
persist to this day. In the Ency- 
clopaedia Britannica, the monk, 
spelled Berthold Schwartz, is 
mentioned four times (in the arti- 
cles on Ammunition, Fireworks, 
Guns and Ordnance), but does 
not have an article of his own. 
On the other hand, Webster’s 
Biographical Dictionary lists him 
as a historical person, merely 
questioning his identity “with the 
Franciscan, Meister (Magister) 
Berthold, real name Konstantin 
Anklitzen.” 

I^EITHER authority, strange- 

’ ly enough, points out that 
Berthold Schwarz (or Schwartz) 
cannot have been his name, 
whether he lived or not. 

The word schwarz (^schwartz 
is merely the older spelling) is 

94 



the German word for “black” and 
in this connection it is also a 
mistake. The older manuscripts, 
both in German and in Latin, re- 
fer to him as Berchtholdus niger, 
which means Berthold the Black. 
For a while, this was properly 
translated into German as Ber- 
thold der Schwarze, until some- 
body wrote the name as Berthol- 
dus Niger, which then produced 
Berthold Schwarz. This is about 
as correct as translating Charle- 
magne’s Latin name, Carolus 
Magnus, as Charles Grand. 

Since we already know that 
guns did exist in 1380 and that 
the invention, therefore, must 
have been made earlier, it might 
be best to work our way back- 
ward from that date. Several his- 
torians of the 19th century did 
just that — they read their way 
through old city chronicles in 
search of mention of guns. 

One, a retired German colonel 
by the name of A. Essenwein, 
found several: 

In 1378, a Johann von Aarau 
made three guns for the city of 
Augsburg and instructed the pa- 
tricians Johann Ilsung, Johann 
Vend and Johann Feinsbach in 
their use. The chronicle of the 
city of Speyer reported in 1374 
that a gunnery master (not 
named) was paid a cash honor- 
arium. The chronicle of Nurem- 
berg for the year 1356 mentions 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a payment to Master Blacksmith 
Saenger for guns and ptowder. 
The expense accounts of the city 
of Frankfurt on the Main were 
preserved beginning with the one 
for the year 1348; they show ex- 
penditures for the purchase of 
guns and gunpowder from that 
date on, but unfortunately do not 
tell where the guns and the pow- 
der were bought. 

There were, however, quite a 
number of places, for the British 
historian John Upman estab- 
lished the mention of gunpowder 
mills for various cities: Augsburg 
had one in 1340, Spandau in 
1344 and Liegnitz in 1348. The 
chronicle of Liibeck for the year 
1360 states fairly calmly that the 
City Hall caught fire because of 
the carelessness of those qui pul- 
veris pro bombardis parabant 
(who make the powder for the 
bombards). 

Another British historian, Os- 
car Guttmann, discovered not 
less than seven documents deal- 
ing with firearms for the period 
from 1344-1348, among them an 
invoice for gunpowder and an 
iron cannon bought by the city 
of Aachen in 1346, a document 
stating that the city of Cambrai 
bought, in 1342, ten cannon, “five 
of iron and five of metal” 
(bronze?) and several bills paid 
by the exchequer of King Ed- 



ward III of England in 1344- 
1347. 

TN ADDITION to these more 

recent researches, the Italian 
historian Muratori stated that, in 
1347, one Hugonino di Chatillon 
made four bronze cannon for the 
Marquise de Monferrato. 

Another “document” is fur- 
nished, believe it or not, by an old 
natural history book. Konrad von 
Megenberg, Archdeacon of the 
cathedral of Regensburg, spent 
the two years of 1349-50 trans- 
lating a Latin work by a French 
churchman into German. The 
original had been written almost 
precisely one century earlier and 
its author, Thomas de Cantim- 
pre, or Thomasius Cantipratensis, 
had likened lightning to a missile 
from a tormenta, one of the 
old crossbowlike javelin-throwers. 
Konrad, the translator, changed 
that sentence to read: “like a 
missile from a shotgun” which, 
because of the noise, seemed to 
him a better comparison to light- 
ning and thunder. 

This not only proves that fire- 
arms existed in 1349, but also 
that they were sufficiently well 
known to be used for literary 
comparisons. 

The oldest picture of a gun 
originated in England in 1326. 
A Walter de Milemete -wrote a 
fairly short work “On the Duties 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

of a Prince” (De Officiis Return) 
and the picture was used to fill 
an otherwise empty manuscript 
page. The gun is not mentioned 
in the text, but its type is known 
to historians. It was a so-called 
“bottle gxm” or vasa (Figure 1), 
which fired darts. 

From the picture, it seems as 
if the firing was accomplished by 
touching a red-hot iron hook to 
the touch hole. Since too much 
gas would leak aroimd the shaft 
of the dart, it can be assuiiied 
that some wadding, probably 
leather, was used. The vasa must 
have been propped up with wood- 
en wedges, but the drawing in 
the manuscript does not show 
this; it shows a bare wooden ta- 
ble. The gunner is shown stand- 



ing off to one side, however, so 
they must have had experience 
with recoil. 

Looking at the picture of a 
vasa, you find that the chroni- 
cler’s sentence “it did no harm"^ 
becomes understandable. The 
wonder is that these weapons 
were not abandoned as soon as 
they had been invented, for they 
must have been awkward to carry 
around, difficult to serve, rather 
expensive and, of course, cursed 
with long intervals between shots. 
A heavy spear thrown by a strong 
man must have been more accu- 
rate and possibly more destruc- 
tive, too. 

The oldest report of the actual 
use of such guns is just one year 
older than this picture. The Eng- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



96 



lish, accompanied by Flemish 
soldiers, fought the Scots, and 
Archdeacon Babour of Aberdeen 
reported that the “crakys of war” 
were a novelty then. He added 
that they had not been used in 
an earlier battle in 1319, when 
the defenders of Berwick fought 
bravely, but “gynis for crakys had 
he [they] nane.” In other words, 
they had no guns to shoot. 

/~kNE very interesting fact is 
that the various places men- 
tioning gunpowder during the 
preceding century do not men- 
tion guns. The oldest source 
about which there is no doubt, a 
Chinese chronicle, speaks of 
rockets and bombs on chains 
(and, by implication, of powder) 
for a war in the year 1232, with- 
out saying when these things 
were invented. (But a later Chin- 
ese chronicler by the name of 
Wuh-i-siao declared categorically 
that “guns came from the outer 
barbarians.” ) 

Only eight years after that bat- 
tle, saltpeter, the most important 
ingredient of powder, was known 
to an Arab savant with the some- 
what unwieldy name of Abu Mo- 
hammad Abdallah ben Ahmad 
Almaliqi. He did not mention 
that it was used for explosive 
mixtures, but the name he used 
is indicative — he called it “Snow 
from China.” Forty years after 



that (around 1280), another 
Arab, Hassan el-Rammah, still 
called rockets alsichem alkhatai 
— “Chinese arrows.” 

By that time rockets had al- 
ready received documentary 
mention in Europe; they were 
used in Cologne in 1258. And 
written prescriptions for making 
powder and rockets were, so to 
speak, all over the place. 

Roger Bacon, whom his con- 
temporaries called with awe and 
some uneasiness the Doctor mira- 
bilis, gave these recipes in his 
Epistola, written in 1247 or 1248. 
Roger Bacon still disguised the 
information; by way of much lit- 
erary padding, he made it appear 
as if he were describing the mak- 
ing of gold or the Philosopher’s 
Stone. 

But his German contemporary 
and counterpart, Albert von Boll- 
stadt or Albertus Magnus (he 
was called the Doctor universalis 
by his contemporaries), wrote 
about the same things openly. 
Just when Albertus wrote the 
one of his many works in which 
powder and rockets are explained 
is not known. One could say that, 
since he died in 1280, it must of 
necessity have been earlier than 
that, but precise dating is unim- 
portant, for both Roger Bacon 
and Albertus had their informa- 
tion from an older book, the 
Liber ignium (“Fire Book”).

Its author, Marchus Graecus, 
is otherwise completely unknown. 
It is likely that he was just the 
translator of an Arabic original 
that is now lost. As for dating, 
my own guess is around 1240; it 
has to be early enough for Roger 
Bacon to read, but it is unlikely 
that it was prior to the time of 
Almaliqi. 

The point of all this is that, up 
to, say, 1280, we hear of powder 
and rockets and of occasional 
bombs, while the “gynis for 
crakys” suddenly appear in 1325 
and are the main thing from then 
on. Evidently the invention of 
the gun falls into this interval of 
about half a century. 

I T WAS around the year 1840 
that an officer of the Belgian 
army, a Major Renard, found an 
entry in the chronicle of the City 
of Ghent. In this so-called Mem- 
orieboek, the entry appears un- 
der the year of 1313, but that 
was the fiscal year of the city, 
which ran from August to August. 
Expressed in calendar years, it 
comprised the second half of 
1313 and the first half of 1314. 

The entry reads: Item, in dit 
jaer was aldereerst gevonden in 
Duitschland het gebruik der bus- 
sen van eenen mueninck. In lit- 
eral translation: “Furthermore, in 
this year was for the first time 
found in Germany the use of 

98 



bussen by a monk.” The word 
bussen is still around in English 
in the word blunderbuss (origin- 
ally Dutch dunderbuss, the first 
part of the word meaning “thun- 
der”) and in German in the word 
Biichse, which means a smooth- 
bore hunting piece. 

In this entry, the genuineness 
and dating of which have stood 
up against all inspection, we find 
missing as well as known ingredi- 
ents of the story stated in dry 
commercial language. The year 
of the invention falls into that 
gap. The country of origin is stat- 
ed to be Germany, as was assert- 
ed about a century later by a 
whole raft of Italian historians, 
two Spaniards and one Greek. 
And the inventor is said to be a 
monk. 

In the following years, the 
Memorieboek contains several 
entries about bussen med kruyd 
(bussen with powder) as an item 
of commerce and, soon after that, 
the King of England began to 
hire Flemish soldiers who had 
the “gynis for crakys.” 

It would be so nice if the gen- 
tlemen who wrote the Memorie- 
boek had seen fit to mention the 
monk’s name. Since he didn’t, 
the name of “black Berthold” 
must have come from elsewhere, 
especially because that sentence 
in the Memorieboek had been 
forgotten until Major Renard re- 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



surrected it in the 19th century. 

The main — but not the only 
— source for the name of the 
monk is another old book with 
a few mysteries of its own. Its 
title is simply “Fireworks Book” 
of which many manuscript are 
known and which was even print- 
ed later. But we are not certain 
who wrote it, for the author did 
not reveal his name. In his fore- 
word, he said by way of apology 
that he had written down all 
these secrets “because there are 
so many things which every Mas- 
ter must know that one cannot 
remember all of them without 
writing.” 

Nor do we know just when it 
was written. One of the oldest 
manuscript copies known (MS 
No. 1481a of the Germanic Mu- 
seum in Nuremberg, if you insist 
on a specific reference) was made 
between 1415 and 1425. Since it 
is known that the gunnery master 
Abraham von Memmingen wrote 
a fireworks book for his Lord, 
Duke Friedrich of Tyrol, in 1410, 
it is believed that this book, of 
which we only know that it was 
written, and the anonymous Fire- 
works Book of which we have 
so many copies are one and the 
same. 

I '*HIS art,” the Fireworks 

A Book says, with reference 
to the art of shooting, “has been 



found by a magister. His name 
was Magister Berthold, who was 
a magister in artibus and who 
dealt with Great Alchemy. The 
Magister Berthold desired to 
burn a gold tincture and this 
tincture requires saltpeter, sulfur, 
lead and oil, and he mixed the 
ingredients together in a copper 
vessel and after he had closed it 
tightly as one must do and put 
the vessel on the fire . the 
vessel broke into small pieces. 
Later the magister left out the 
oil and the lead and put charcoal 
into it and tried to find whether 
one might throw a stone that 
way.” 

This, at first glance, looks like 
an entirely different story. From 
the sources surveyed so far, we 
had a right to conclude that at 
some time around the year 1300 
somebody, identified by the 
chronicle of Ghent as a monk in 
Germany, invented the gun but 
did not have to invent the powder 
because it was already well 
known to literate men of the 
time. Now the Fireworks Book 
says that Friar Bertholdus — 
whom others called Berthold the 
Black — invented both and did 
so more or less by accident while 
pursuing an experiment in al- 
chemy. 

We’ll soon see that there is 
some sense to the story. 

As for the experiment itself, 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

the alchemical reasoning has 
been clearly explained by the 
famous French historian of chem- 
istry, Marcellin Berthelot. Mer- 
cury, which obviously was a very 
puzzling substance to people of 
that time, was believed by some 
to be the prima materia, the 
“original substance.” Because it 
was that (I’m now quoting from 
Berthelot), “it had to be solidi- 
fied first; that is, made solid and 
stable in fire like the other metals. 
Then it had to be colored by 
means of a coloring principle, 
white or yellow ... so it would 
be changed into silver or gold.” 

Apparently it was believed 
that the “original substance,” if 
left uncolored, would look black, 
for making it was often referred 
to as “preparing the blackness” 
— and outsiders to whom this 
term may have “leaked” called 
the whole thing the “black art.” 
Hence Berthold the Black may 
very well mean Berthold the Al- 
chemist. 

A Swiss priest, Felix Hemmer- 
lin (of course he Latinized his 
name, into Malleolus), who 
wrote, incidentally while impri- 
soned, around 1460 and who does 
not seem to have known about 
the purely military and some- 
what secret Fireworks Book, told 
very much the same story. 

Mercury, as everybody knows, 
is liquid because it is inhabited 



by a basilisk that must be driven 
out. The alchemist Berthold 
(Hemmerlin does not mention 
that he was a monk, presumably 
because he had claimed earlier 
that “monks are dumb and lazy” 
and did not want to ruin his own 
argument) tried to do this first 
by heat alone and then by adding 
the sulphus, which is hot by Na- 
ture, and the saltjjeter, which is 
cold by Nature, so that in the 
battle between the hot and the 
cold substance, the basilisk might 
be killed, too. 

F olk tale has it that Friar 
Bertholdus had studied at St. 
Blasien and that he received his 
degree there. It also says that his 
fellow monks were highly indig- 
nant (read: afraid) about his al- 
chemical experiments and impri- 
soned him. And although he is 
said to have been a member of 
the Monastery of Thennenbach, 
which belonged to the Cistercian 
Order, he was later referred to as 
a Franciscan. 

All this can easily be true. St. 
Blasien was the nearest seat of 
learning to Freiburg. That the 
fellow monks were afraid of ex- 
plosions is understandable and if 
the prior imprisoned him, he only 
did to Berthold what other spirit- 
ual superiors did to Roger Bacon. 
Finally, since the Franciscans are 
a much stricter order than the 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




BERTHOLD THE BLACK 
From Andr6 Thevet's work on lives of iltus* 
trious people, published in Paris in 1584. 



Cistercians, it may well be that 
it was the punishment he finally 
received or, rather, the “pardon” 
— namely, to join a stricter order. 

There is no documentary proof 
known, but the various events at 
least make a logical sequence. 
And if the story of the explosion 
because of an alchemical experi- 
ment is true, one may assume 
that Berthold quickly recognized 
what it was that had happened 
to him. He must have read the 
works of Albertus Magnus at St. 
Blasien and may even have met 
the Doctor universalis in person, 
for Albertus was an inveterate 
traveler. 

A few words about dates must 



still be added to this report. 

The oldest document about 
firearms — if dated correctly — 
is an old drinking song in which 
each stanza tells of an improba- 
ble feat. In one, a crayfish plays 
on a horn; in another, a bumble- 
bee rhapsodizes on Biblical 
themes; in a third, an old and 
toothless steer bites the heads of 
twelve lions off, etc. etc. One of 
these stanzas reads in part: 

Ich sach uz einer biichsen 
schiessen, daz es nieman hort 

siben wachteln zerstort. 

« 

I can’t translate this so that it 
rhymes, but line for line it reads: 

I saw that with a bussen 
shooting, which nobody heard, 
seven quail destroyed 

In short, everybody knew that a 
bussen did make noise. Now 
comes the difficult question of 
dating. The known manuscript 
copy was made in 1371, accord- 
ing to a statement on the manu- 
script itself. But when was it 
written? One other stanza reads: 

The Romans already knew 
that Count Konrad’s 
house in Freiburg is finished. 

UNFORTUNATELY, there 
^ were three counts by that 
name in Freiburg. The first of 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



101 



the three died in 1271, the second 
in 1350 and the third in 1422, 
which is too much of a spread. 
But the first of the three was in- 
strumental in building a very spe- 
cial “house,” the cathedral, which 
might well have been referred to 
as Count Konrad’s house. 

The tower of the cathedral 
was finished after Konrad’s 
death, in 1296. The song must 
have been written fairly soon af- 
ter that date — the completion 
of the building was news — prob- 
ably within a decade or so. The 
song might, therefore, antedate 
the entry in the Memorieboek by 
a few years — logically so, for it 
was written in Freiburg, where 
Friar Bertholdus frightened his 
fellow monks. 

But then where did “they” get 
the date of 1354 to put on the 
monument or 1388 when Ber- 
tholdus was allegedly “executed 
from life to death”? 

The first one is simple. The 
Bavarian historian Johannes 
Thurmayr (who called himself 
Johannes Aventinus) found in 
Hemmerlin’s book the statement 
that it took two centuries for 
Berthold’s invention to become 
known. Thurmayr thought this 
too long and settled for one cen- 
tury; but Hemmerlin had not 
said from what year he counted 
backward, so Thurmayr counted 
from the year in which Hemmer- 

102 



lin was imprisoned, which was 
1454. Don’t be surprised at such 
carelessness. It was also Thur- 
mayr who converted Black Ber- 
thold into Berthold Black. 

The year 1380 came from the 
collective effort of a number of 
Italian authors. Although Mura- 
tori mentioned earlier dates for 
the use of firearms in Italy, most 
Italians were convinced that the 
weapon first appeared when Ven- 
ice fought Genoa about the island 
of Chiozza. Their words instru- 
mento nuovo trovato (newly in- 
vented instrument) make it clear 
that they thought the invention 
had just been made; the war 
about Chiozza was over in 1381. 
And seven years later, the devil 
took the inventor — no, no, in 
1388 A.D. he was executed. 

To accomplish this, the story 
was told that Friar Bertholdus 
was offered and accepted a pro- 
fessorship in Prague. King 'Wen- 
ceslas, who ruled then, was known 
to be free with death sentences, 
so all that was needed from the 
point of view of the storyteller 
who wanted to do away with the 
inventor was to move him to 
Prague. 

But when questioned in 1890, 
the head librarian of the Univer- 
sity of Prague could name all the 
professors of that time. No Friar 
Bertholdus or Magister Berthol- 
dus was among them. The story 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of his execution was merely a 
story, just like the other story 
that he died in an explosion. 

In all probability, he died a 
normal death. But we would like 
to know where and when. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Does any form of life exist on 
the Earth that is not based on 
carbon? I have read someplace 
that there is a small plant on the 
Antarctic continent that is based 
on silicon. 

Earl H. Mann 
12859 Sherman Way 
North Hollywood, Calif. 

You may have read this in a 
story without rememhering 
now that it was fiction and not 
an article. There are various 
life-forms that utilize silicon 
compounds for protective 
spikes, etc. Some plants get rid 
of silicon, which they absorbed 
without much need for it, by 
excreting it. The so-called 
“bamboo pearls” that caused 
much superstitious to-do in the 
past are an example. But the 
living tissue of all plants and 
animals on Earth is based on 
carbon. 

Perhaps this doesn’t belong in 
GALAXY, but you may be able 
to settle a minor point of dispute. 



Is there now or has there ever 
been a German noble family by 
the name of Frankenstein? 

Pfc. John M. Kilgus 
AMEDS-Det. APO 154 
c/o PM, New York 
To my own surprise, the an- 
swer is yes. There exists a fam- 
ily of the Barons von Francken- 
stein — spelled with a “c,” 
you’ll note — two members of 
which have made the grade of 
being listed in “Webster’s Bio- 
graphical Dictionary.” 

The first is Georg Arhogast 
Baron von und zu Francken- 
stein (1825-1890), who was a 
well-known politician in his life- 
time, having been the leader of 
the (Catholic) Centrist Party, 
member of the Reichstag and, 
for a while, vice-president of 
the Reichstag. 

The other member of the 
family was (or still is) the 
composer Clemens Baron von 
Franckenstein (born 1875) 
who composed several operas, 
Griseldis (in 1898), Rahab (in 
1911) and Li Tai Pe (in 1920). 

I don’t think, however, that 
Mary Shelley had this family in 
mind when she wrote Frank- 
enstein. She probably just 
picked a typically Teutonic 
name.

Picture Bride 

As pretty as a picture? Yes, 
because that was all she was 
...or would become some day! 



By WILLIAM MORRISON 

Illustrated by EMSH 



M y brother, Perry, always 
was a bit cracked. As a 
kid, he almost blew up 
our house doing experiments. 
When he was eighteen, he wrote 
poetry, but fortunately that didn’t 
last long and he went back to 
science. 

Now, when he showed me this 
picture, I figured he’d had a re- 
lapse of some kind. “This is the 
girl I’m in love with,” he said. 

She wasn’t bad. Not bad at all, 
even if her clothes were crazy. 
She wasn’t my type — too brainy- 
looking — although I could see 
how some guys would go for her. 
‘*I thought you liked blondes.” 



“I wouldn’t give you two cents 
for all the blondes in Hollywood,” 
he answered. “This is the only 
girl for me.” 

“You sound as if you’ve got it 
bad,” I said. “You going to marry 
her?” 

His face dropped about a mile. 
“I can’t.” 

“You mean she’s married al- 
ready?” I was surprised. This 
wasn’t like Perry at all. 

He sort of hesitated, as if he 
was afraid of saying too much. 
“No, she isn’t married. I asked 
her about that. But I can’t marry 
her because — well. I’ve never 
met her. All I’ve seen of her is 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this picture and a few more. She 
doesn’t live here.” 

“You mean she’s in Europe?” 
I’ve heard of these love affairs by 
mail, and they never made much 
sense to me. I said to Perry, “Why 
can’t she come to this country?” 
“Oh, there are a lot of things 
in the way.” 

It sounded worse and worse. I 
said, “Look, Perry, this smells like 
a racket to me. It’s the kind of 
thing a couple of shrewd opera- 
tors cook up to take some hick 
for a ride. I’m surprised at you 
falling for it. How do you know 
there really is a dame like that 
in Europe? Anybody can send 
pictures — ” 

“You’ve got it all wrong,” he 
said. “I’ve spoken to her.” 

“By phone? How do you know 
who’s on the other end? You hear 
a dame’s voice you never heard 
before. What makes you think 
it’s hers?” 

A gain he didn’t seem to want 
to talk, as if he had some 
secret to hide. But I guess he felt 
like gettings things off his chest, 
too, or he wouldn’t have opened 
up in the first place. And he had 
already told me enough so that 
if he didn’t tell me more he’d 
sound like a dope. 

So after hesitating even longer 
than before, he said, “Let’s get 
this straight, George. This is no 



racket. I’ve seen and talked to 
her at the same time. And the 
things she talked about, no con 
man would know.” 

“You’ve seen and talked to her 
at the same time? You mean by 
TV? I don’t believe it. They can’t 
send TV to Europe.” 

“I didn’t say it was TV. And I 
didn’t say she lived in Europe.” 
“That’s exactly what you did 
say. Or maybe you meant she 
lived on Mars?” 

“No. She’s an American.” 

“This makes less and less sense 
to me. Where did you meet her?” 
He turned red, and squirmed 
all over the place. Finally he said, 
“Right here in my own labora- 
tory.” 

“In your own laboratory! But 
you said you never met her in 
the flesh!” 

“I didn’t. Not really by TV 
either. The fact is — she isn’t 
born yet.” 

I backed away from him. When 
he was a kid and blew up our 
kitchen, I didn’t like it. When he 
wrote poetry, I was kind of 
ashamed and didn’t want my pals 
to know he was my brother. Now, 
I was really scared. Everything 
he had been saying in the last 
ten minutes began to make sense, 
but a screwy kind of sense. 

He saw how I felt. “Don’t 
worry, George, I haven’t gone 
crazy. Her time is 2973, more

than a thousand years from now. 
The only way I’ve seen and 
talked to her is on a time-contact 
machine.” 

“Come again?” 

“A kind of time machine. It 
can’t send material objects back 
and forth across time, as far as I 
know, but it can send certain 
waves, especially the kind we use 
to transmit signals. That’s how 
she and I could talk to each other 
and see each other.” 

“Perry, I think you ought to 
see a good doctor.” 

“It’s a remarkable device,” he 
said, paying no attention to how 
I was trying to help him. “She’s 
the one who first constructed it 
and contacted me. It’s based on 
an extension of !^instein’s equa- 
tions — ” 

“You think you can explain so 
much,” I said. “Okay, then, ex- 
plain this. This dame isn’t going 
to be born for a thousand years. 
And yet you tell me you’re in 
love with her. What’s the differ- 
ence between you and somebody 
that’s nuts?” I asked, as if any- 
body knew the answer. 

H e certainly didn’t. In fact, he 
went ahead and proved to me 
that they were the same thing. 
Because for the next couple of 
weeks, the only thing he’d talk 
about, outside of equations I 
couldn’t understand, was this 



dame. How smart she was, and 
how beautiful she was, and how 
wonderful she was in every way 
that a dame can be wonderful, 
and how she loved him. For a 
time he had me convinced that 
she actually existed. 

“Compared with you,” I said, 
“Romeo had a mild case.” 

“There are some quantities so 
great that you can’t measure 
them,” he said. “That will give 
you some idea of our love for 
each other.” 

There it went, the old poetry, 
cropping out in him just like be- 
fore. And all the time I’d been 
thinking it was like measles, 
something that you get once and 
it builds up your resistance so 
you don’t get it again, at least 
not bad. It just goes to show how 
wrong I could be. 

“What preacher are you going 
to get to marry you?” I asked. “A 
guy born five hundred years from 
now?” 

“I don’t think that’s funny,” he 
said. 

“You’re telling me. Look, Perry, 
you’re smart enough to know 
what I’m thinking — ” 

“You still think I’m crazy.” 

“I got an open mind on the 
subject. Now, if you won’t see a 
doctor — then how about letting 
me take a look at this dame, so I 
can convince myself?” 

“No,” he said. “I’ve considered 



PICTURE BRIDE 



107 



doing that, and decided against 
it. Her voice and image come 
through for only about five min- 
utes a day, sometimes less. And 
those minutes are very precious 
to us. We don’t want any one else 
present, any one at all.” 

“Not even to convince me she 
actually exists?” 

“You wouldn’t be convinced 
anyway,” he said very shrewdly. 
“No matter what I showed you, 
you’d still find a reason to call it 
a fraud.” 

He was right at that. It would 
take a lot of convincing to make 
me believe that a babe who 
wasn’t going to get born for a 
thousand years was in love with 
him. 

By this time, though, I was 
sure of one thing — there was 
something screwy going on in 
that laboratory of his. For five 
minutes a day he was watching 
some dame’s picture, listening to 
her voice. If I had an idea what 
she was like, I might figure out 
where to go from there. 

1 BEGAN keeping an eye on 
Perry, dropping in at the lab- 
oratory to pay him visits. There 
was what looked like a ten-inch 
TV tube in one corner of his 
place, not housed in a cabinet, 
but lying on the table among doz- 
ens of other tubes and rheostats 
and meters and other things I 



didn’t know about. Along the wall 
that led from this corner was a 
lot of stuff which Perry said was 
high voltage, and warned me not 
to touch. 

I kept away. I wasn’t trying to 
figure out how to get myself 
killed. All I wanted to know was 
when he saw this girl. 

Finally I managed to pin the 
time down to between three and 
four in the afternoon. For five 
minutes every day, during that 
hour, he locked the door and 
didn’t answer phone calls. I fig- 
ured that if I dropped in then I 
might get a glimpse of her. 

And that’s what I did. 

At first, when I knocked on the 
door, there was no answer. In a 
minute, though, I heard Perry’s 
voice, but he wasn’t talking to me. 
He was saying, “Darling,” and he 
sounded kind of sick, which I 
figured was due to love. Come to 
think of it, he might have been 
scared a little. I heard him say, 
“Don’t be afraid,” and it was quiet 
for about fifteen seconds. 

Then I heard a terrific crash, 
like lightning striking. The door 
shook, and I smelled something 
sharp, and the first thing I wanted 
to do was get out of that place. 
But I couldn’t leave my brother 
in there. 

I put my shoulder to the door 
and had no trouble at all. The 
explosion, or whatever it was, 



10S 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



must have weakened the hinges. 
As the door crashed in, I looked 
for Perry. 

There was no sign of him. But 
I could see his shoes, on the floor 
in front of that TV tube, where 
he must have been standing. No 
feet in them, though, just his 
socks. All the high-voltage stuff 
was smoking. The TV screen was 
all lit up, and on it I could see 
a girl’s face, the same girl whose 
picture Perry had shown me. She 
was wearing one of those funny 
costumes, and she looked scared. 
It was a clear picture, and I could 
even see the way she gulped. 

Then she broke out into a 
happy smile and, for about half 
a second, before the second ex- 
plosion, I could see Perry on the 



screen. After that second explo- 
sion — even though it wasn’t 
near as big as the first — that 
TV set was nothing but a mess of 
twisted junk, and there was no 
screen left to see anything on. 

Perry liked to have everything 
just so, and he’d never think of 
going anyplace without his tie 
being knotted just right, and his 
socks matching, and so on. And 
here he’d traveled a thousand 
years into the future in bare feet. 
I felt kind of embarrassed for 
him. 

Anyway, they were engaged, 
and now they must* be married, 
so I guess she had slippers wait- 
ing for him. I’m just sorry I 
missed the wedding.

FORECAST 



Next month's installment of PREFERRED RISK by Edson McCann, the Galaxy-Simon & 
Schuster prize novel, adds to its portfolio of tension and devious threat as it reveals the 
premium put on an insured world. For there is a price for protection against all the sins 

and ills of mankind . but how big is it, who pays, who is the beneficiary . and 

is it worth the cost? No, the answers are riot as simple and clear-cut as the actuarial 
tables they are based on! 

Even if there is room for only one novelet, it's a truly big and important one. THE 

MAPMAKERS by Frederik Pohl charts the course of an expedition as historical and fear- 

some as Columbus's . more so, in fact, because his great danger was falling off the 
edge of Earth, which is naturally impossible . while this one's is toppling right out of 
the Universe, which isn't impossible at alii Then why must the harrowing trip be made? 
Well, you've undoubtedly wondered who calibrated the jumps through hyper-space that 
bridge the light-years between solar systems. Here they are, the whole heroic crew of 
people capable of fear and bewilderment in an unknown dimension, doing a job because 
it has to be done! You won't forget them or the tormented man who discovers how 
necessary a handicap can be!

Grandy Devil 

By FREDERIK POHL 

Speak of the devil and Grandy appeared — but 
not when he was desperately, urgently needed! 



Illustrated by ASHMAN 



M AHLON begat Timothy, 
and Timothy begat Na- 
than, and Nathan begat 
Roger, and the days of their years 
were long on the Earth. But then 
Roger begat Orville, and Orville 
was a heller. He begat Augustus, 
Wayne, Walter, Benjamin and 
Carl, who was my father, and I 
guess that was going too far, be- 
cause that was when Gideon Up- 
shur stepped in to take a hand. 

I was kissing Lucille in the par- 
lor when the doorbell rang and 
she didn’t take kindly to the in- 
terruption. He was a big old man 



with a burned-brown face. He 
stamped the snow off his feet and 
stared at me out of crackling 
blue eyes and demanded, 
“Orvie?” 

I said, “My name is George.” 

“Wipe the lipstick off your 
face, George,” he said, and walked 
right in. 

Lucille sat up in a hurry and 
began tucking the ends of her 
hair in place. He looked at her 
once and calmly took off his coat 
and hung it over the back of a 
chair by the fire and sat down. 

“My name is Upshur,” he said. 



no 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Gideon Upshur. Where’s Orville 
Dexter?” 

1 HAD been thinking about 
throwing him out up until then, 
but that made me stop thinking 
about it. It was the first time 
anybody had come around look- 
ing for Orville Dexter in almost 
a year and we had just begun 
breathing easily again. 

I said, “That’s my grandfather, 
Mr. Upshur. What’s he done 
now?” 

He looked at me. “You’re his 
grandson? And you ask me what 
he’s done?” He shook his head. 
“Where is he?” 

I told him the truth: “We 
haven’t seen Grandy Orville in 
five years.” 

“And you don’t know where he 
is?” 

“No, I don’t, Mr. Upshur. He 
never tells anybody where he’s 
going. Sometimes he doesn’t even 
tell us after he comes back.” 

The old man pursed his lips. 
He leaned forward, across Lu- 
cille, and poured himself a drink 
from the Scotch on the side table. 

“I swear,” he said, in a high, 
shrill, old voice, “these Dexters 
are a caution. Go home.” 

He was talking to Lucille. She 
looked at him sulkily and opened 
her mouth, but I cut in. 

“This is my fiancee,” I said. 
“Hah,” he said. “No doubt. 
Well, there’s nothing to do but 



have it out with Orvie. Is the 
bed made up in the guest room?” 

I protested, “Mrs Upshur, it 
isn’t that we aren’t glad to see 
any friend of Grandy’s, but Lord 
knows when he’ll be home. It 
might be tomorrow, it might be 
six months from now or years — ” 
“I’ll wait,” he said over his 
shoulder, climbing the stairs. 

H aving him there wasn’t so 
bad after the first couple of 
weeks. I phoned Uncle Wayne 
about it, and he sounded quite 
excited. 

“Tall, heavy-set old man?” he 
asked. “Very dark complexion?” 
“That’s the one,” I said. “He 
seemed to know his way around 
the house pretty well, too.” 

“Well, why wouldn’t he?” Un- 
cle Wayne didn’t say ansdhing 
for a second. “Tell you what, 
George. You get your brothers 
together and — ” 

“I can’t, Uncle Wayne,” I said. 
“Harold’s in the Army. I don’t 
know where William’s got to.” 

He didn’t say anything for an- 
other second. “Well, don’t worry. 
I’ll give you a call as soon as I 
get back.” 

“Are you going somewhere, 
Uncle Wayne?” I wanted to 
know. 

“I certainly am, George,” he 
said, and hung up. 

So there I was, alone in the 
house with Mr. Upshur. That’s 



GRANDY DEVIL 



111 



the trouble with being the young- 
est. 

Lucille wouldn’t come to the 
house any more, either. I went 
out to her place a couple of times, 
but it was too cold to drive the 
Jaguar and William had taken 
the big sedan with him when he 
left, and Lucille refused to go 
anywhere with me in the jeep. 
So all we could do was sit in her 
parlor, and her mother sat right 
there with us, knitting and mak- 
ing little remarks about Grandy 
Orvie and that girl in Eatontown. 
So, all in all, I was pretty glad 
when the kitchen door opened 
and Grandy Orvie walked in. 

“Grandy!” I cried. “I’m glad to 
see you! There’s a man — ” 

“Hush, George,” he said. 
“Where is he?” 

“Upstairs. He usually takes a 
nap after I bring him his dinner 
on a tray.” 

“You take his dinner up? 
What’s the matter with the ser- 
vants?” 

I coughed. “Well, Grandy, af- 
ter that trouble in Eatontown, 
they — ” 

“Never mind,” he said hastily. 
“Go ahead with what you’re do- 
ing.” 

I finished scraping the dishes 
into the garbage-disposer and 
stacked them in the washer, while 
he sat there in his overcoat 
watching me. 

“George,” he said at last, “I’m 



an old man. A very old man.” 

“Yes, Grandy,” I answered. 

“My grandfather’s older than 
I am. And his grandfather is older 
than that.” 

“Well, sure,” I said reasonably. 
“I never met them, did I, 
Grandy?” 

“No, George. At least, I don’t 
believe they’ve been home much 
these last few years. Grandy 
Timothy was here in ’86, but I 
don’t believe you were born yet. 
Come to think of it, even your 
dad wasn’t born by then.” 

“Dad’s sixty,” I told him. “I’m 
twenty-one.” * 

“Certainly you are, George. 
And your dad thinks a lot of you. 
He mentioned you just a couple 
of months ago. He said that you 
were getting to an age where you 
ought to be told about us Dex- 
ters.” 

“Told what, Grandy Orville?” 
I asked. 

“Confound it, George, that’s 
what I’m coming to! Can’t you 
see that I’m trying to tell you 
something? It’s hard to put into 
words, that’s all.” 

“Can I help?” said Gideon Up>- 
shur from the door. 

G randy Orviiie stood up 
straight and frosty. “I’ll thank 
you, Gideon Upshur, to stay the 
be-dickens out of a family dis- 
cussion!” 



GRANDY DEVIL 



113 



“It’s my family, too, young 
man,” said Gideon Upshur. “And 
that’s why I’m here. I warned 
Cousin Mahlon, but he wouldn’t 
listen. I warned Timothy, but he 
ran off to America — and look 
what he started!” 

“A man’s got a right to pass on 
his name,” Grandy Orville said 
pridefully. 

“Once, yes! I never said a man 
couldn’t have a son — though 
you know I’ve never had one, 
Orvie. Where would the world 
be if all of us had children three 
and four at a time, the way you 
Dexters have been doing? Four 
now — sixteen when the kids 
grow up ^ sixty-four when their 
kids grow up. Why, in four or 
five hundred years, there’d be 
trillions of us, Orvie. The whole 
world would be covered six lay- 
ers deep with immortals, squirm- 
ing and fidgeting and — ” 

“Hush, man!” howled Grandy 
Orville. “Not in the front of the 
boy!” 

Gideon Upshur stood up and 
yelled right back at him. “It’s 
time he found out! I’m warning 
you, Orville Dexter, either you 
mend your ways or I’ll mend 
them for you. I didn’t come here 
to talk — I’m prepared to take 
sterner measures if I have to!” 
“Why, you reeking pustoon,” 
Grandy Orville started — but 
then he caught sight of me. “Out 



of here, George! Go up to your 
room till I call you. And as for 
you, you old idiot, I’m as pre- 
pared as you are, if it comes to 
that — ” 

I went. It looked like trouble 
and I hated to leave Grandy 
Orville alone, but orders were 
orders; Dad had taught me that. 
The noises from the kitchen were 
terrible for a while, but by and 
by they died down. 

It was quiet for a long, long 
time. After a couple of hours, I 
began to get worried and I went 
back downstairs quietly and 
pushed the kitchen door open a 
crack. 

Grandy Orville was sitting at 
the kitchen table, staring into 
space. I didn’t see Mr. Upshur 
at all. 

Grandy Orville looked up and 
said in a tired voice, “Come in, 
George. I was just catching my 
breath.” 

“Where did Mr. Upshur go?” 

I asked. 

“It was self-defense,” he said 
quickly. “He’d outlived his use- 
fulness, anyway.” 

T STARED at him. “Did some- 

thing happen to Mr. Upshur?” 

I asked. 

He sighed. “George, sometimes 
I think the old blood is running 
thin. Now don’t bother me with 
any more questions right now, till 
I rest up a bit.” 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Orders were orders, as I say. 
I noticed that the garbage-dis- 
posal unit was whirring and I 
walked over to shut it off. 

“Funny,” I said. “I forgot I 
left it running.” 

Grandy Orville said nervously, 
“Don’t give it a thought. Say, 
George, they haven’t installed 
sewer lines while I was away, 
have they?” 

“No, they haven’t, Grandy,” I 
told him. “Same old dry well and 
septic tank.” 

“That’s too bad,” he grumbled. 
“Well, I don’t suppose it matters.” 
I wasn’t listening too closely; 
I had noticed that the floor was 
slick and shiny. 

“Grandy,” I said, “you didn’t 
have to mop the floor for me. I 
can manage, even if all the ser- 
vants did quit when — ” 

“Oh, shut up about the ser- 
vants,” he snapped testily. 
“George, I’ve been thinking. 
There’s a lot that needs to be 
explained to you, but this isn’t 
the best time for it and maybe 
your dad ought to do the explain- 
ing. He knows you better than I 
do. Frankly, George, I just don’t 
know how to put things so you’ll 
understand. Didn’t you ever no- 
tice that there was anything dif- 
ferent about us Dexters?” 

“Well, we’re pretty rich.” 

“I don’t mean that. For in- 
stance, that time you were run 
over by the truck when you were 



a kid. Didn’t that make you sus- 
pect anything — how soon you 
mended, I mean?” 

“Why, I don’t think so, 
Grandy,” I said, thinking back. 
“Dad told me that all the Dex- 
ters always healed fast.” I bent 
down and looked under the table 
Grandy Orville was sitting at. 
“Why, that looks like old clothes 
down there. Isn’t that the same 
kind of suit Mr. Upshur was 
wearing?” 

Grandy Orville shrugged tired- 
ly. “He left it for you,” he ex- 
plained. “Now don’t ask me any 
more question, because I’ve got 
to go away for a while and I’m 
late now. If your Uncle Wayne 
comes back, tell him thanks for 
letting me know Mr. Upshur was 
here. I’ll give your regards to 
your dad if we happen to meet.” 

W ELL, that was last winter. I 
wish Grandy would come 
back so I could stop worrying 
about the problem he left me. 

Lucille never did get over her 
peeve, so I married Alice along 
about the middle of February. 
I’d have liked having some of the 
family there at the wedding, but 
none of them was in town just 
then — or since, for that matter 
— and it wasn’t really necessary 
because I was of legal age. 

I was happy with Alice right 
from the start, but even more 
important, it explained what 



GRANDY DEVIL 



IIS 



Grandy and Mr. Upshur had 
been trying to tell me. About 
what us Dexters are, that is. 

Alice is a very attractive girl 
and a good housekeeper, which 
is a good thing — we haven’t 
been able to get any of the ser- 
vants back. But that’s good, too, 
in a way, because it keeps her 
inside the house a lot. 

It’s getting on toward nice 
weather, though, and I’m having 



a tough time keeping her away 
from the third terrace, where 
the dry well and septic tank are. 
And if she goes down there, she’s 
bound to hear the noises. 

I don’t know. Maybe the best 
thing I could do would be to roll 
the stone off the top of the septic 
tank and let what’s struggling 
around in there come out. 

But I’m afraid he’s pretty mad.

EARTHLIGHT by Arthur C. 
Clarke. Ballantine Books, $2.00 
Cloth, 35c Paper 

T KNOW of no one who can 
i make the as-yet-unknown so 
vividly and immediately real as 
Arthur C. Clarke. Earthlight, 
which deals with life on the 
Moon at a time when it is serv- 
ing as a way station to Terr an 
outposts on most of the planets 
and large satellites of our system, 
has the palpable, almost visual 
effect of an eyewitness report. 

The plot is a fairly standard 
type of melodrama, but it is de- 



veloped with all the author’s 
abundant ability to make even 
melodrama plausible. For my 
money, this is the best tale about 
what it would be like on the 
Moon that has yet been written.

EXPLAINING THE ATOM by 
Selig Hecht. Revised and with 
Four Additional Chapters by Eu- 
gene Rabinowitch. Viking Press, 
$3.75 

XT’S a pleasure to have a chance 

to bring this book, which ori- 
ginally appeared in 1947, to your 
attention. It is still far and away 
the best lay book on atomic 
energy ever written. 

Dr. Rablnowitch’s revisions 
and additions to the late Dr. 
Hecht’s text are excellent, too, 
and the book makes the history 
and science of nuclear physics — 
including the hydrogen bomb — 
clear, understandable and genu- 
inely exciting. 

It does assume a fairly mature 
reader, since it is not “written 
down” or patronizing or over- 
simplified, but anyone who can 
read Galaxy can read and profit 
by it.

MESSIAH by Gore Vidal. Bal- 
lantine Books, 35c 

‘j%/|’Y' REACTION to this aston- 
■^’-■-ishing novel can best be sum- 
marized by describing it as 
“Henry James cross-pollinated 
with M. P. Shiel.” For it is writ- 
ten (at first, at least) with an 
almost Jamesian luxuriance of 
style, while the plot is almost 
Shielian in fantastic vividness. 
The story is that of an anti- 
religious religious leader who 
preaches that Death is more de- 
sirable than anything. It tells 
how his simple but poisonous 
ideas are subverted by a Holly- 
wood-type publicity man and 
how the narrator, who begins by 
being persuaded of the Messiah’s 
creed, ends by being his (or, 
rather, the publicity man’s) an- 
tagonist. 

It’s a strange and uncomfort- 
able anti-utopia, done with much 
more than routine literary skill.

from his non-fact “Encyclopedia 
of Galactic Culture.” 

They, the Heinlein and novel- 
las by Pohl, Sturgeon and Damon 
Knight come from Galaxy; 
stories by Poul Anderson, Walter 
M. Miller, Jr., and the late Mal- 
colm Jameson are from Astound- 
ing. None has ever been antholo- 
gized before, either. 

I think the book is an essential 
addition to anyone’s basic library 
of science fiction. 

THE CHEMICALS OF LIFE by 
Isaac Asimov. Abelard-Schuman, 
$2.50 

/~kNE of the best science popu- 
larizations I have ever read 
is here presented, unfortunately, 
as a juvenile. It isn’t. Asimov 
(yes, our Asimov) has simply 
taken the basic knowledge about 
enzymes, vitamins and hormones 
and translated it into the lan- 
guage of the layman. 

I have always found biochem- 
istry a formidable subject, but 
this little volume offers a delight- 
ful and understandable introduc- 
tion to it. And the drawings by 
John Bradford are excellent, too. 

THE REBELLIOUS STARS by 
Isaac Asimov; AN EARTH 
GONE MAD by Roger Dee. Ace 
Books, 35c 



Ace double contains the 
ever-superb The Stars, Like 
Dust, here quite unnecessarily re- 
titled as above — Galaxy read- 
ers remember it as Tyrann — 
and Dee’s ominous-pitched piece 
of turgidity about a world of to- 
morrow in which some sort of 
alien “things” are gradually tak- 
ing over the human race, indi- 
vidual by individual, and turn- 
ing them into willing slaves. 

THE CHAOS FIGHTERS by 
Robert Moore Williams. Ace 
Books, 25c 

npHE prolific short-story writer 
Robert Moore Williams’ first 
novel deals with parapsychology 
and with the notion of genetic 
leaps: the idea that Man pro- 
gresses not by gradual, almost 
invisible evolution, but by sud- 
den mutations. 

In this fast-moving job, the 
mutation is both physical and 
moral; and, despite its overmelo- 
dramatic plot and undistin- 
guished style, it makes its point 
quite positively. It’s no master- 
piece, but I think you will enjoy 
it, if you like still more about the 
unlimited power of Mind over 
Matter. Personally, I could do 
with less of Psi; it’s being ram- 
med both into the ground and 
down readers’ throats.

DESIGN OF THE UNIVERSE 
by Fritz Kahn. Crown Publishers, 
$5.00 

T^OR someone who wants a 
bird’s-eye view of science, 
from physics to geology, from 
chemistry to astronomy, this 
book will have a useful function. 
It’s big, profusely (though not 
always well) illustrated, and 
very Comprehensive indeed. The 
style is lively and the inaccura- 
cies, which are not few, are minor. 
It’s almost a home correspond- 
ence course in science, without 
any of the pedantry that too of- 
ten mars such courses. 

As books go today, it’s a re- 
markable bargain at its price. 
Definitely worth your considera- 
tion. 

FALSE NIGHT by Algis Budrys. 
Lion Books, 35c 

B uilt around Budrys’ Gal- 
axy story “Ironclad,” this 
book achieved for me a maxi- 
mum of confusion with a mini- 
mum of direction — and yet I 
found it moderately good reading. 

It’s another tale of the attempt 
of remnants of the human race 
to recivilize itself after an un- 
named world catastrophe, and 
it’s almost as bloody and chaotic 



as the situation would be if it 
actually occurred. 

EXPLORING MARS by Robert 
S. Richardson. McGraw-Hill 
Book Co., $4.00 

T he only thing wrong with 
this study is its title, for less 
than 100 of its 252 pages are 
devoted to the Red Planet. 

Actually, the book is a fine re- 
view of current knowledge on the 
prospects of space travel, the na- 
ture of lunar existence, the prob- 
abilities of Martian ecology, and 
what conditions would be like on 
the other planets of the Solar 
System. 

A good job, though perhaps a 
bit simple for those who have 
already boned up on the subject 
in more advanced books. Fine, 
though, for the novice. 

T>R/£F NOTES. Tenn’s Of All 
Possible Worlds, originally 
reviewed in these columns in 
April, 1954, is at last published 
by Ballantine (35c). Watch for 
it . Donald Day informs me 
that, the price of his invaluable 
Index to the Science Fiction 
Magazines is still $6.50, not $5.00 
as I erroneously reported in 
February.

GAtAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



(Continued from page 4) 

“Now the U.S.D.A. entomolo- 
gists are figuring out how many 
sterilized males will be needed to 
hunt down all the females in the 
state of Florida. They are even 
hoping to use the same method 
to exterminate other insect pests 
whose females are equally mon- 
ogamous.” 

Bully for our side, of course 
— with such animal suffering 
and economic waste involved, I 
take my stand boldly against the 
screw worm. 

But it brings up, as I men- 
tioned, the question of invasion 
techniques that writers are so 
fond of. Alien conquest of Earth 
is the usual goal of these stories, 
though sometimes it’s the East- 
West conflict. Many of the meth- 
ods suggested are clever; none, 
however, has been as devilish as 
the one quoted. 

Before anybody leaps hope- 
fully to the typewriter, let me 
point out that it’s only some in- 
sects that go on reproducing af- 
ter a single impregnation. A good 
thing, too, or we’d be up to here 
in flora, fauna and each other. 
And a world like that should be 
given gladly to any beings will- 
ing to take it. 

Our lures and traps are all ap- 
peals to basic instincts. The 
moose and duck calls, and the 
supersonic gadget that broadcasts 
the mosquito siren song and 



brings males crashing into an 
electrified barrier, play on sex 
drive. Food is more commonly 
used, of course, but there are 
others, too. 

Assuming one wants to wipe 
out mankind, what’s the best 
bait? Food, sex and such are fine 
for destroying individuals, but I 
doubt if they can be made to do 
in the whole species. 

Well, war is the closest thing 
to alien invasion. Why do people 
fight? The realpolitik reason is 
generally .real estate, but that’s 
for the statesmen; the population 
needs slogans to die for. They 
won’t accept cynical goals. 

So with those who know suck- 
ers best — on a cosmic scale — 
idealism is a thousand-to-one 
favorite over lust and greed. 

If universal suicide could be 
induced, there would be less of a 
mess. Here are the necessary con- 
ditions: 

The suicide rate is four times 
as high after 60 as before 20; 
higher among divorced than mar- 
ried persons; among professionals 
than non-professionals; white-col- 
lar workers than laborers; officers 
than enlisted men; urbanites than 
ruralites. 

But it’s too complicated. I’ll 
put my money on idealism. I 
wish it weren’t so exploitable, 
yet that’s the essence of a lure 
— and idealism is Man’s bait.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Inside Story 

By RICHARD WILSON 



Even Mars had its silly season, when news 
is so slack that it has to be invented . 
only this item was the horrifying McCoy! 

Illustrated by MEL HUNTER 



T he teletype on the wave 
to Earth clacked briefly to 
life and Scott Warren look- 
ed inquiringly at the operator. 
The operator handed him the 
message from Galactic News 
Service headquarters in New 
York. It said; dullest here. 
ANYTHING RPT ANYTHING AVBL YR 
END QUERY. 

Scott, bureau chief at lopa, 
Martian headquarters for Galac- 
tic News, shrugged and said, 
“Tell them ‘Nothing repeat noth- 
ing available here. Deadest ever.’ ’’ 
Kathy Brand, a red-headed 
reporter, looked up from her desk 
where she was pecking fitfully at 



a typewriter. She held out a slip. 

“I’ve got a real hot item here 
on the longevity of the Martian 
sand lizard, if that’s any help, 
Scott,’’ she said. “Honestly, I’ve 
never seen it so slow.’’ 

T he door from the corridor 
opened and George Mercer 
came in, carrying himself care- 
fully as if he were maintaining 
his balance only by the utmost 
concentration. 

“Hi, people,” George said. “No- 
tice anything different about 
me?” 

George covered the Martian 
parliament for Galactic News, 



NSIDE STORY 



123 



but parliament was out of ses- 
sion now and he’d been switched 
temporarily to a roving assign- 
ment. 

“You sound tinny,” Scott said, 
“as if you had something in your 
throat. Been treating it down at 
New York Dan’s?” New York 
Dan’s was the bar and steak- 
house nearby. 

“Sober as a senator,” George 
Mercer asserted. “Guess again.” 

“You look sort of — flattened 
out,” Kathy Brand said. “Your 
tunic isn’t hanging right, for in- 
stance, and your breeches are all 
bunched up.” 

“Observant girl. She’ll go far, 
Scott. It happens you’re both 
right, in a way. I’m wearing the 
latest in outdoor fashion — an in- 
visible suit. Over my regular out- 
fit. Ask me why.” 

“Why?” Kathy asked duti- 
fully. 

“Trying it out for a friend. It’s 
heatproof and airtight.” 

“Skintight, too,” Scott said. 

“True,” George said. “It clings. 
That’s one of its advantages. No 
more cumbersome spacesuits. No 
clanking around like a trained 
monster when you have to ex- 
plore an airless world. Go as you 
are in cool comfort, retain your 
dexterity. Communicate by short 
wave. That’s why I sound tinny.” 

“How come it’s invisible?” 
Scott asked. 

“Just happened. A batch of 



gunk boiled over and my friend 
discovered that made it non-re- 
fractive. So of course you can’t 
see it. Just an extra added attrac- 
tion. The suit would work just 
as well in sky-blue or yellow- 
stripe, if that happened to be the 
fashion.” 

“What does your friend plan 
to do with it?” 

George shrugged. “He’s a re- 
search chap. Figures things out, 
or stumbles on them. Leaves it 
to others to find a use for them.” 

“Hmm,” Scott said. “If we 
could make you invisible, as well 
as the suit, we might scare up a 
story. New York’s been utmost- 
ing us for copy and all we’ve 
got is the latest Museum pro- 
nouncement on the sand lizard.” 

“Mid-season doldrums, eh?” 
George absent-mindedly reached 
toward his pocket, but was stop- 
ped by the all-enveloping suit. 
He grinned. “I was going for a 
cigarette, but I couldn’t get any- 
thing in my mouth anyway. Does 
my face look scrunched around 
any? It feels all lopsided under 
this stuff.” 

“It flattens out your nose a 
little,” Kathy said. “If I remem- 
ber your old nose correctly. But 
nothing serious. How do you 
breathe?” 

“Oxygen pack in my belt. Self- 
charging and it lasts indefinitely. 
I’d just as soon have a little real 
air now, though.” He began to 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



peel off the suit, starting with 
some sort of fastening under the 
chin. 

They watched him, fascinated. 
He looked as if he were pulling 
invisible spider webs from vari- 
ous parts of his body. Finally he 
sat down and, lifting one leg at a 
time, pulled handfuls of nothing 
off the ends of his feet. 

“Better remember where you 
put it down,” Scott said, “or 
you’ll never find it again.” 

A COMMUNICATOR lighted 
up and Scott answered it: 
“Galactic News, Warren.” 

It was a GN stringer at Druro, 
site of a notorious concentration 
camp of the former Martian re- 
gime. 

The camp was now a nully 
colony. The nullies were outcasts 
— diseased, feeble-minded, ani- 
mal-people — mostly Martians 
and a few Earth people, too, 
transported from the slums of 
lopa, Senalla and other big Mar- 
tian cities to the remote wilder- 
ness around Druro. 

There was no known cure for a 
nully. His disease, highly con- 
tagious, was so loathsome that the 
Martian government deemed the 
nully colony the best solution 
short of extermination. Scott 
sometimes wondered if Druro’s 
nully colony was any better than 
the old concentration camp of the 
deposed Rockhead regime. 



The Druro stringer was calling 
Scott about the latest of a series 
of rumors about the colony. The 
reports could not be verified be- 
cause none but a nully ever en- 
tered the colony, set back in the 
hills. 

The nullies lived a wild life in 
the huts and barracks scattered 
around, or in caves, as they chose. 
Once inside the colony they never 
came out. Supplies were air- 
dropped to them and pilots often 
reported scenes of savagery as the 
ragged nullies fought over the 
food packages. 

The rumors were about the 
nullies organizing. That they had 
leaders who enforced discipline. 
The old anarchistic ways were 
being curbed and some mysteri- 
ous project was in the works t^ack 
in the hills, hidden from the 
eyes of spotter pilots. 

The stringer had a new one 
this time. He’d seen mysterious 
lights floating above the colony, 
at levels ranging from six feet to 
two thousand feet. The funny 
thing, the stringer said, was that 
the nullies didn’t seem to be 
alarmed by the lights. They either 
took no notice of them or, in 
one or two instances, seemed to 
be friendly with them — almost as 
if they were in communication. 

Scott Warren took notes as the 
stringer talked, then thanked him 
and asked him to keep in touch 
with the situation. 



INSIDE STORY 



125 



S COTT knocked out a story of 
a few hundred words and 
sailed it to the operator for trans- 
mission to news-hungry Earth. 

But then he thought better of 
it and took it back. 

“I’m getting sophomoric in my 
tedium,” he said. “This could 
start off the silly season with a 
bang. I wish I knew what was 
really going on in that nully 
colony, though.” He put the story 
on the spike. 

George Mercer lifted it off and 
read it. Then he said to Scott, 
casually, “Like me to find out 
for you?” 

“Huh?” 

“I’m on roving assignment,” 
George said. “I could easily rove 
over Druro way.” 

“I admit you’re a better re- 
porter than our stringer there,” 
Scott said. “I suppose you could 
scratch together a decent think- 
piece or a situationer, but I 
frankly don’t believe it would 
justify the expense.” 

“You’re talking about a knot- 
hole view, from outside the 
fence,” George said. 

“Of course.” 

“Well, I’m not,” said George. 
“I’m talking about an inside 
story.” 

“Inside the nully colony?” said 
Scott. “You’re crazy!” 

“I would have been yesterday. 
But today I’ve got a new suit.” 
He looked around for it. “Wher- 



ever I put it. Wearing that, I 
could get inside without risking 
infection and without anybody 
suspecting I was anything but an- 
other poor old nully.” 

“I repeat,” said Scott, “you’re 
crazy. They never let anybody 
out of the colony once he’s in. 
You know that.” 

George gestured airily. “A mere 
administrative detail. That’s your 
department, as I see it. You’d 
have to persuade the Health 
Commission that the suit does 
make me contagion-proof and 
then arrange to get me out when 
I have the story. I’ll keep you 
posted on interim details by short 
wave.” 

K athy Brand wandered over. 

“You’d better give up, 
George,” she said. “Scott’s pretty 
pigheaded about this hero busi- 
ness. I learned that when I 
sneaked off to the outlaw camp 
and pretended I was a convert — 
just to make a story. Scott’s still 
sore because he had to play hero 
himself to come rescue me. Made 
him very uncomfortable.” 

“An altogether different situa- 
tion,” said George stiffly. “Go 
’way, little girl, and don’t bother 
us big men.” 

Kathy shook her head insist- 
ently so that her long red hair 
whipped across her face. “It’s ex- 
actly the same thing. I quote you 
the words of the master, which 



T26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



are engraved in my memory in 
letters of fire: ‘We’re reporters, 
not secret agents. Our job is to 
report the news, not make it.’ 
By Scott Warren, Bureau Chief. 
Ask him.” 

Scott smiled. “She may have a 
point there, George. There’s no 
double standard any more, you 
know. What’s sauce for the goose 
. if you’ll excuse the expres- 
sion, Kathy.” 

She made a face at him, but 
George Mercer scowled. 

“Look, Scott,” he said. “If 
you’re going to say no, okay, 
it’s no. But you haven’t said it 
yet and I don’t think you will. 
This is no hero pitch. This is 
an assignment, geared to the cir- 
cumstances. I have no intention 
of doing more than finding out 
what goes on in the nully colony 
and doing a straightforward re- 
porting job. If I stumble across 
anything too big for me. I’ll hol- 
ler for help. But if there’s any- 
thing to be found I’ll find it. 
There’s a story there, in any case. 
Now give me your answer — yes 
or no — like a newsman, not like a 
big sister.” 

“Well . .” said Scott. 

George grinned triumphantly 
at Kathy. “Okay,” he said, “it’s 
settled. You start cutting the red 
tape, Chiefie, and I’ll get in some 
research on the nullies so I can 
act like one. Now where did I 
put that suit?” 



G eorge Mercer had been 
gone three days. He hadn’t 
reported in all that time, and 
Scott Warren sat by a communi- 
cator, nibbling on a fingernail, 
waiting. 

There was nothing else to do. 
The doldrums were still on. The 
operator sat at his silent ma- 
chine, a pastime button plugged 
in one ear, grinning idiotically at 
some program no one else was 
able to hear. Kathy Brand sat at 
her desk, putting on lipstick. 

Scott made a check mark on a 
pad. “This is the sixteenth time, 
by actual count, that you’ve 
made yourself a new mouth,” he 
said. 

“I can’t help it,” she said. “I 
keep biting it off. Why doesn’t 
he call in?” 

Scott shrugged. “I have no ob- 
jections to makeup,” he said. “On 
the contrary. But I do object to 
women giving themselves more 
lip than they really have. It’s in- 
sincere.” 

“I experiment,” Kathy said. 
“I’ve got a right. I don’t tell you 
how to shave.” 

“True,” said Scott, starting on 
another fingernail. 

The communicator buzzed and 
lit up. He snapped it on. 
“Galactic News, Warren.” 
“Hello, Scott,” a tinny voice 
said. “This is George, I guess.” 
“Go ahead, George,” Scott 
yelled. “What do you mean ‘I 



NSIDE STORY 



127 




guess’? Are you all right? Come 
on — talk!” 

“It’s pretty rugged in here. I’ve 
been on the labor detail ever since 
I got in. The new arrivals get 
the worst of it. This is the first 
chance I’ve had to get away by 
myself.” 

“Have you seen any of those 
lights?” 

“Only from a distance. I don’t 
know what they are. But every 
time they come there’s some sort 
of conclave back in the hills. I 
haven’t been able to get in on 
the party. Only the Regulars are 
allowed back there.” 

“The Regulars?” 

“The leaders. The strongest 
ones among those with the most 
seniority. They’re a pretty clan- 
nish crew.” 

“Have you got anything that’d 
make a story? Forgive me for 
being commercial.” 

“Not yet. I just wanted to re- 
port in. Wait a minute — some- 
body’s coming. I’ll leave the beam 



on so you’ll hear, in case I can’t 
talk to you again. I’d leave it 
on all the time, but I’ve got to 
conserve the power.” 

There was an interim of silence, 
punctuated only by George’s 
breathing. Then Scott heard a 
faint voice. 

“What you do out here?” 
“Just takin’ a walk, boss,” 
George’s voice said meekly. 

“You get back!” 

There was an “Uh!” from 
George, as if he’d been struck, 
or kicked. “Okay, boss. I’m go- 
ing.” 

“You go fast. Got work to do.” 
Evidently George decided there 
was no point in communicating 
any more of this. The wave went 
dead. 

A buzz woke Scott Warren. 

He snapped on his bedside 
communicator reflexively. He 
checked the time — about an hour 
before dawn. 

There was a wild laugh from 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the speaker. Then a low voice 
said, “Don’t talk to me! Just 
listen!’’ 

It had a tinny sound and Scott 
recognized it immediately. He 
kept silent. 

“Great Scott! The lights!” the 
voice said. “By George!” 

George Mercer, somewhere in 
the nully colony, and obviously 
where he could be overheard, was 
improvising a code to identify 
himself. 

There was an insane cackle, not 
from George but close by him. 

“Pretty lights!” another voice 
said. “I catch!” 

“Balloons,” George said. “Like 



NSIDE STORY 



129 



fire balloons, as big as your head. 
You like balloons, Mogi?” 

“Very fine,” the voice replied — 
a Martian voice. “I catch.” 

“Look out!” George’s voice. 
“Duck! It’s trying to catch you!” 
There was the wild laugh again. 
“It did catch you! Went right 
into your head and disappeared. 
Great Scott! Can you imagine 
that?” 

I hear you, George, Scott said 
to himself. Good work, boy. I 
hope you’re all right. 

“Mogi,” George said. “Speak to 
me, Mogi, you old balloon-head. 
Mogi! Where are you going? 
Come back!” 

There was perhaps a minute of 
silence, then George’s voice came 
again, normal now and pitched 
softly. “Scott. You there?” 

“Yes,” he whispered. 

“Good. This will have to be 
quick. There were two balloons 
and two of us. Mogi and I were 
committed in the same batch. 
He used to be a pit-filler at the 
spaceport; lived in that slum be- 
hind Market East. He’s a pretty 
sick boy. I copied his cough and 
his cackles. But these balloons. 
They’re about six inches in diam- 
eter, yellow-white, glow in the 
dark, and they appear to have 
intelligence. You hear me all 
right?” 

“Fine,” Scott said. “I’m making 
notes.” 

“Naturally,” George chuckled. 



“Put us both down for overtime. 
Anyhow, Mogi and I slipped 
away to pick edibark — anything 
to supplement our austerity diet. 
We were in the woods when the 
two fire balloons came over. They 
swooped at us. One went right for 
Mogi, seemed to merge with his 
head, then disappeared complete- 
ly. The other one made a pass 
at me, but then veered off and 
zoomed away. Mogi went dashing 
off in the brush. 

“That’s the picture, Scott. No 
time to theorize now. I’ve got to 
get back before they find I’m 
missing, or there’ll be new welts 
on my tender hide. The suit’s no 
protection against that sort of 
thing. Tell Kathy she was right 
about this secret agent stuff. I 
shoulda stood in the newsroom.” 
The tinny voice stopped. 

S COTT sat for a moment, lis- 
tening to the faint whoops 
and squeals of a disconnected 
wave, then flicked off the com- 
municator. He swung his feet out 
of bed, lit a cigarette and read 
over his notes. 

The glowing balloons, with 
their seeming intelligence, had 
avoided George. Did his skin- 
tight invisible suit protect him 
from the balloons, as well as from 
infection from the diseased nul- 
lies? And, having preferred the 
Martian, were the balloons now 
suspicious? 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Scott went back a step. If the 
fire balloons were intelligent, or 
directed by intelligence, what 
were they? Some new outlaw de- 
vice? 

Not likely. The outlaws, bad- 
ly defeated in their last guerrilla 
foray against World Govern- 
ment troops, had retreated into 
the desert wastes. That was their 
land — the flat desert beyond Revo 
to the north — not the scrubby 
hills and dwarf forest of the 
Druro nully colony. 

Were the balloons perhaps a 
tool of the “Regulars,” the self- 
appointed leaders of the colony? 
It was possible they were just 
awe-inspiring gadgets to keep the 
lesser nullies in line. But then 
they wouldn’t have awed George 
unless they were something more 
sinister. 

Maybe this was the time to 
call in the authorities. George 
was just one man and his only 
resources were his untested suit, 
his reporter’s ingenuity and his 
tenuous link of communication to 
Galactic News — which, after all, 
was only a civilian agency with 
highly unofficial standing at 
W.G. headquarters. As Kathy 
Brand had reminded him, it was 
really a job for the World Gov- 
ernment Investigators, the pro- 
fessional secret agents. 

But George, in spite of his half- 
serious grumble as he signed off, 
would be indignant if he were 

INSIDE STORY 



pulled off the assignment now, 
just when he’d made his first re- 
vealing contact. 

Scott snuffed out his cigarette 
and lay back. 

“Okay, George,” he said half- 
aloud, “it’s your story. But don’t 
kill yourself getting it.” 

K athy Brand filled a cup 
with cold water from a ca- 
rafe. She set the cup on Scott’s 
desk and plunked a tablet into it. 
The liquid churned up, turned 
dark and began to steam. 

“Black,” she said, “as directed. 
That’s your fourth cup of coffee 
this morning, Scott. You must 
have been out all night,” 

“Up,” he said, “but not out. 
George called me at home.” 

“Oh? Any news?” 

“Nothing waveworthy,” he said, 
“unless we go off half-cocked and 
tip our hand. No use letting the 
opposition in on what we’re do- 
ing until we can sew up the 
yarn.” 

He was telling her what George 
had learned so far when the 
Earthwave began to clack away. 
The operator handed him the 
message, welcome matcher i.n. 
SAYING EXSENALLA LIFE REPORTED 
DEIMOS. 

I.N. was Interplanetary News, 
Galactic’s major rival. Senalla 
was Mars’ second biggest city. 

“That old chestnut,” Scott 
snorted. “They drag that one out 

131 



every year or so, whenever it’s 
dull. If it isn’t Deimos, it’s Pho- 
bos.” 

Nevertheless he scanned the 
drop copy from the Mars circuit. 
Nothing there. He prepared a 
message for the GN bureau at 
Senalla. N.y. has i.n. reviving 

PERENNIAL ABOUT LIFE DEIMOS- 
WISE. WANT OWN STORY ONLY IF 
ABLE NAIL DOWN HARD QUOTES EX- 
HEAVIEST AUTHORITIES OTHERWISE

The acknowledgment came im- 
mediately with this added note. 
ALREADY CHASING. APPEARS I.N. 
MAY HAVE SOMETHING THIS TIME. 
INFORMATIVELY THEY QUOTE SCAV- 
ENGER SKIPPER REPORTING MOLES- 
TATION BY FIERY GLOBES WHILE 
UPPICKING SCRAP. 

“Fiery globes!” Kathy said. 
“Isn’t that what George saw?” 
“Yes,” he said. “Kathy, call 
the Observatory. Get Dr. Erris; 
he knows us. See if he has any 
independent knowledge. If not, 
try to get a quote from him on 
the possibility of life on Deimos, 
or comment on the scavenger 
skipper’s story.” 

“Right.” 

S COTT itched to call George 
Mercer, but he knew it would 
be unwise. George couldn’t talk 
if he were under the eyes of the 
nully leaders — ^the Regulars. His 
existence was tough enough with- 
out complicating it further. Scott 



would just have to wait till 
George called him. 

Kathy had got through to Dr. 
Erris and was making notes as 
she talked to him. Scott looked 
over her shoulder and read her 
neat abbreviated longhand. 

“Dr unheard skipper story un- 
has own knwldg life Marsmoons 
but wld spose if existed b totly 
alien life as knwn Mars-Earth 
owing uttr lack air infintsml 
grvty outpointg too sevl explore- 
trips unfnd lifesigns . .” 

Scott turned away to the Se- 
nella printer, which had come 
to life. Kathy’s story was too un- 
sensational to be anything but a 
“with” piece. 

But GN’s Senalla bureau had 
something, senalla, mars — 
(gn) — “Reports from a scavenger 
ship that life in the form of fiery 
globes might exist on Deimos, 
Mars’ farther satellite, received 
a cautious reception in official 
quarters here. 

“Spokesmen who were quick to 
discount similar reports in past 
years have guarded answers to- 
day when asked to confirm or 
deny the story. 

“It was learned that the Com- 
mission of Exploration and As- 
sessment had dispatched a scout 
ship to Deimos to check up on 
the reports, which came origin- 
ally from the master of the scav- 
enger vessel.” (memo desk: i.n. 
UPSEWED SKIPPER PLUGGED ALL

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



LEAKS BEFORE TURNING HIM OVER 
TO C.E.A. BUT WE SEEKING INTER- 
VIEW FIRST MATE.) . 

Scott read copy on the story, 
tore off and spiked the memo, 
and gave the story to the operator 
to put on the wave to Earth be- 
fore New York could complain 
again about I.N.’s big beat. 

Kathy, finished talking to Dr. 
Erris, typed out her piece. It 
wasn’t much, but it would keep 
the story ticking for a while. 
Scott penciled through the copy, 
wrote “With Senalla Globes” at 
the top of it and passed it on to 
the operator. 

Obviously there was a connec- 
tion between what the scavenger 
skipper had seen on Deimos and 
the fire balloons George Mercer 
had been in the nully camp. If 
only George would call in, GN 
might be able to recoup on the 
story. 

Interplanetary News was now 
miles ahead, having gone full tilt 
with first and second leads, adds, 
bulletin intros, urgents, precedes, 
follows and all the other sluglines 
of a fast-breaking story. Galactic 
limped along behind. The com- 
bined efforts of the lopa and 
Senalla bureaus could produce no 
more for the Earth wave than 
two “it was learned” stories, 
Kathy’s “with” bit and half a 
dozen “speculation here” think 
pieces and sidebars. 

Far from appeasing Galactic’s 



head office, these seemed only to 
infuriate it. By the time Scott 
Warren had an ill-digested lunch 
and his fifteenth cup of coffee at 
his desk, the messages from New 
York had reached a peak of im- 
plied invective in the tightly 
written waves of interplanetary 
communications. 

K athy Brand plopped an- 
other coffee tablet into a cup 
and set it in front of Scott. 

“What we need,” she said, “is 
an interview with one of those fire 
globes. I don’t think Senalla’s 
ever going to find that first mate. 
I could take the correspondent 
car and make a fast jaunt to 
Deimos. T Talked to a Fiery 
Globe, an Exclusive Galactic 
News Interview by Kathy Brand.’ 
How about it, Scott?” 

“No!” he shouted, slamming 
his palm on the desk. “We can’t 
spare any more heroes.” 

Kathy looked hurt at his show 
of temper. “I was only kidding. 
Chief,” she said. “Don’t take it 
so hard. Suppose I.N. did beat 
us on this one. It’s just a fluke. 
We scoop them every other day 
in the year.” 

Scott took a sip of the hot 
coffee, then put the cup down 
with a clatter. “I’m not worrying 
about scoops and beats. I’m won- 
dering what the hell happened 
to George.” 

As if on cue, the communicator 



INSIDE STORY 



133 



buzzed and lighted up brightly. 

“Galactic, Warren,” Scott 
barked. 

“This is your wandering boy,” 
said George’s voice, tinny but 
clear. 

“George! Are you all right? 
Where are you?” 

“I’m all right, considering. I’m 
in no man’s land — ^halfway be- 
tween the Regulars back in the 
hills and the new nullies, the ones 
that came in recently. I’m an 
outcast.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I mean neither group will have 
anything to do with me. The 
Regulars have barricaded them- 
selves and won’t let anybody else 
in. They’ve got crude weapons, 
but they’re effective enough — 
they winged me once with a 
slingshot — and I beat it out of 
there. And the new nullies — ^those 
who’ve been here six months or 
less — have all been taken over by 
the balloons. The balloons are in- 
telligent, Scott, no doubt about 
it, and when they take over a 
nully he becomes a real smart 
cookie.” 

“The balloons are from Dei- 
mos, from all indications,” Scott 
told him. “They’ve been seen 
there, at least.” 

“Interesting,” George said. 
“Have they showed up anywhere 
else?” 

“No.” 

“Apparently they’ve all come 



here. You can only see them at 
night and obviously they’re the 
lights our Druro stringer saw 
here in the nully colony. You 
spiked that yarn, but I suppose 
it’s common property now and 
Druro’s crawling with the press.” 
“As a matter of fact, nobody’s 
connected the two,” Scott said. 
“Maybe we’d better have an eye- 
witnesser from you now, before 
they beat us with our own story.” 
“I’d rather you didn’t, Scott. 
If you can hold off a while long- 
er, I may be able to give you a 
better yarn.” 

“What’s your theory? Are the 
Deimons taking over the nully 
colony? But why only there? And 
why are the Regulars keeping the 
others at bay? It sounds as if 
the Regulars are immune to 
them, somehow. And you, George. 
Why haven’t the balloons taken 
you over?” 

“I don’t know. I’m working on 
it. I don’t think it’s the suit, but 
something stops them.” 

“What are they up to, these 
balloons?” 

“From what I’ve seen — they 
don’t let me get too close — I’d 
say it was some kind of mobiliza- 
tion. The nullies hold secret con- 
claves. They size up the Regu- 
lars’ fences. They drill, like mili- 
tia, with sticks for guns. Individ- 
ually they act pretty crazy, like 
typical nullies, but when you put 
the pieces together there seems 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to be a plan behind it all. If you 
want a snap answer I’d say they 
were mobilizing for — take it or 
leave it — conquest.” 

“Conquest? Of the Regulars?” 
“Just at first,” George said. 
“Then of Druro. And then maybe 
the rest of Mars.” 

G alactic News caught up 
with the life-on-Deimos story 
by the second day, after the skip- 
per of the salvage ship issued an 
official statement through the 
C.E.A., but Interplanetary News 
wa§ basking in its initial beat 
and its stories were getting the 
play on Earth. Bits of Galactic’s 
dispatches, the New York bureau 
told Scott angrily, were being 
shirt-tailed on to the I.N. stories, 
if used at all. 

Scott fidgeted, bit a fingernail, 
drank black coffee and wished 
he hadn’t promised George he’d 
hold off on the Druro angle. But 
of course he had to, if George’s 
position was not to be jeopard- 
ized further. There was still a 
chance that GN could regain all 
it had lost, if things broke right. 
Scott was worried, though, that 
by then he’d be a nervous wreck. 
And George, if his suit failed 
him, could become a physical 
wreck — a nully — doomed to 
spend the rest of his life in the 
colony. 

One small satisfaction was that 
there would be no more hard 



news about the globes on Deimos, 
now that World Government had 
stepped in. W.G.’s Exploration 
and Assessment Commission was 
notoriously hush-hush when it 
was on the trail of something 
that might even remotely affect 
the public safety. If he knew E 
8s A, and he did, there wouldn’t 
even be a leak about its activities 
until it had everything analyzed, 
categorized, ecologized and then, 
perhaps, partly declassified. 

So it all depended on George. 

And George came through. A 
first-rate reporter with an in- 
stinctive sense of deadline and 
drama, he called in at the right 
moment. 

“George Mercer here,” he said 
in a terse whisper. “Stand by.” 

Scott turned up the volume for 
the voice-cast from George. He 
flipped on the switch to record it. 
He directed Kathy to make long- 
hand notes for ready reference 
and another staffer to make a 
complete shorthand transcription 
for fuller interim quotes if they 
were needed before the tape play- 
back could be used. Scott sta- 
tioned himself next to the opera- 
tor on the Earthwave, ready to 
dictate bulletin matter direct. 

G EORGE’S voice came again. 

“Here’s the situation. The 
nullies — ^the newcomers like me 
— are preparing to attack the 
Regulars. I’m pretty sure that by 



NSIDE STORY

now all the nullies except me 
have been taken over by the fiery 
balloons. I assume the Regulars 
are not possessed, but I don’t 
know why not. «. 

“The Regulars will be at- 
tacked at the weakest spot in 
their perimeter — a segment of 
barricade built at the top of a 
sandy hill. If the nullies can 
loosen a couple of logs, they’re 
in. 

“The Regulars are armed to 
their back teeth, with slings, 
spears, clubs, pots of boiling 
water, primitive stuff like that, 
but plenty effective against un- 
armed men. That’s what the nul- 
lies are, except for their crazy 
sticks. Whether they have some 
special kind of power because 
the balloons have taken them 
over, I don’t know. I should 
think they’d have to.” 

“Where are you, George?” 
“I’m up a tree,” George said 
wryly. “Literally. I’ve climbed 
the tallest tree overlooking the 
battlefield and I’m pretty well 
hidden. I’ll give it to you play- 
by-play as soon as the whistle 
blows. That ought to be any 
minute, if I’ve eavesdropped cor- 
rectly.” 

“Good boy,” said Scott. “Have 
you seen any of the fire balloons 
lately? As such, I mean?” 

“Not since last night. A dozen 
of them, traveling in formation, 
went over the barricade. They all 



came back, as if they tried to 
take over the key men among the 
Regulars and’ failed. They 
hovered around the nullies for a 
while, then took off.” 

“In what direction?” 

“Straight up,” said George. 
“Deimos was zooming up from 
the horizon at the time, if you 
want to make anything of that.” 
“I’ll make a note of it, for 
now,” Scott said. 

T he nullies came out of the 
dwarf forest, each carrying 
a piece of wood fashioned like a 
Q rifle. The nullies, looking pur- 
poseful and unafraid, walked up 
the sandy hill toward the barri- 
cade. They did not run. They 
held the mock rifles at present 
arms, not aiming them. 

The regulars opened fire. 
Spears whistled, rocks were 
slung, wicked boomerangs hurt- 
led. The attackers went down, 
singly at first, then in pairs, then 
by the dozen. They made no at- 
tempt to take cover or increase 
their pace. Those that remained 
upright continued to walk, inex- 
orably, toward the barricade. 
The wounded hobbled or crawled 
toward it. 

“I don’t get it,” George said at 
one point in his description. “It’s 
suicide.” 

The massacre went on. Finally 
there was only one nully left. As 
if unaware that he was alone, he

137 



walked on. He had been hit in 
the arm and dropped his stick, 
but he went on. A new barrage 
came from behind the barricade, 
concentrating on the lone at- 
tacker. He went down. 

One last spear whistled through 
the air and there was a gasp of 
pain from George Mercer. 

“It got me in the arm, Scott,” 
he said in a low, taut voice. “Pin- 
ned me to the tree trunk.” 

Scott heard sounds that told 
him George must be trying to 
wrench the spear loose. Then he 
heard, “It’s no use. I can’t get it 
out. Tore the suit, dammit!” 
That meant George no longer 
had protection from the disease 
that infected all the nullies, the 
loathsome disease without a cure 
that turned men into animals. 

“They’re coming out from be- 
hind the barricade,” George’s 
pain-wracked voice said. “The 
Regulars. They’re finishing off 
that nully who was wounded at 
close range.” 

“George, never mind that 
now,” Scott said urgently. “We’ve 
got to get you out of there. Give 
me your coordinates, as near as 
you can, and we’ll have a World 
Government ship to you in ten 
minutes.” 

“Too late, Scott. They’ve spot- 
ted me. Here they come now.” 
There was no way out. If they 
didn’t kill him, they would cap- 
ture and infect him. Those were 



the alternatives — death or a 
living death. 

“They’re under the tree now,” 
George said. “I guess they’re not 
going to kill me or they’d’ve done 
it already. One of them’s climb- 
ing up. One of the leaders. An 
Earthman.” 

Scott heard George’s heavy 
breathing, then the rustle of 
branches being climbed. 

An unfamiliar voice was say- 
ing, “Okay, fella, let’s get you 
loose. If you bystanders insist on 
getting in the way, you’re bound 
to get hurt.” 

There was a sharp crack, ap- 
parently the spear being broken 
off close to George’s arm. George 
gasped with pain. 

“Now brace yourself,” the 
voice said, “while I pull you off 
the rest of it.” 

There was a shuddering groan 
from George. Then silence. 

“He fainted,” someone said. 
“Lost a lot of blood. Here, I’ll 
lower him to you. Easy! He’s not 
a sack of meal, he’s a man. And 
a brave man at that.” 

S COTT Warren and the others 
at Galactic News listened in 
taut silence. Kathy Brand, who 
sometimes pretended to be a 
hardboiled newsgal, had tears in 
her eyes. 

Scott, for the dozenth time 
since George left for Druro, 
looked frustrated. George’s fate 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was in the hands of the Regulars 
— ^the mysterious people of the 
nully colony who in some un- 
known way had risen above their 
destiny and become men again. 
At least the man who had taken 
George down from the tree was 
no nully. He was a man of leader- 
' ship and intelligence. He even 
had a sense of humor. 

Scott hadn’t dictated any- 
thing. Sure, there had been a 
battle, and one side had won, but 
what did it all mean? Without 
perspective, the story would be 
a bare recital of meaningless 
events. 

He could make nothing of the 
desultory talk, as the unconscious 
George was carried inside the 
barricade. There were sounds that 
told him they were preparing to 
treat George’s arm, which had 
been tourniqueted earlier, then 
expressions of surprise when it 
was discovered that George was 
wearing a transparent protective 
suit. 

He heard the leader say in 
further surprise, “What’s this?’’ 

Apparently George’s com- 
municator was found. Then there 
was no more talk and in a mo- 
f ment someone had clicked off the 
communicator. 

A N hour passed. Two hours. 
* Quitting time came, but no 

one went home. The day shift 
filled in the oncoming night shift 



on the details of George Mercer’s 
capture. 

The staffers sat around, taking 
routine calls from the men on the 
beats, knocking out routine 
stories, doing the routine news 
roundups for the special clients, 
drinking coffee, getting in each 
other’s way, smoking much too 
much. 

The day operator, speaking of 
George, referred to him in the 
past tense. Kathy rebuked him 
gently. 

He apologized. 

They saw the Martian night 
come quickly, settle over the city 
and the sandy wastes beyond. 
Lights blazed on in lopa, winked 
on here and there in the out- 
skirts. But beyond that there 
was only blackness. 

And somewhere out there was 
George. 

Scott stopped pacing the floor 
and sat down with decision. 

“It’s not my responsibility any 
more,” he said to no one in par- 
ticular. “I’ve stood around like 
a helpless nincompoop long 
enough. It’s time to call in the 
professionals.” 

“World - Government?” Kathy 
asked. 

Scott nodded. He reached for a 
handset. 

George’s voice beat him to it. 
“Hello, Galactic,” it said. 

Scott whirled in his chair. 
“Hello, you beat-up old report- 



NSIDE STORY 



139 



er,” he yelled into the communi- 
cator. Then he asked kindly, 
“How is it, Georgie, kid?” 
“Scott?” George said. “Work- 
ing overtime again? Me, too. Lis- 
ten, I’m all right, They saved my 
arm. Gave me a transfusion — 
crude but effective. What’s more 
— listen carefully, boy — I’m not 
a nully. I’m as healthy and full 
of corpuscles as you are.” 

“That’s great!” Scott said. 
“The gloom around here was so 
thick you could have planted lil- 
ies in it. But are you sure? How 
can you tell?” 

“Also who, what, when and 
where,” said George happily. “Al- 
ways the newsman, you old 
ghoul. All right. I’ll be objective. 
I don’t know for absolutely sure, 
of course. Nothing you could dic- 
tate a bulletin on yet. But if you 
can get W.G.’s Health Commis- 
sion to fly in some nully special- 
ists, I’m ninety-nine per cent cer- 
tain they’ll find I’m no Typhoid 
Mary. And what’s more — get 
this, Scott — neither are any of the 
Regulars.” 

“What?” 

“I said the Regulars are not 
nullies. They were, but they’re 
not any more. That’s the who 
and the what. Here comes the 
why. Maybe you’d like to take it 
down.” 

“You’re being recorded on 
tape, you hero,” Scott said. “Go 
on.” 



“Z^KAY. I’m no medical writer, 
but it’s my theory that nul- 
lies are bred in the slums. Dirt, 
malnutrition, bad sanitation. I 
think there’s probably a psycho- 
somatic angle to it, too — squalor, 
apathy and hopelessness play a 
part. But then they put the nul- ^ 
lies in the colony here. The only 
object was segregation, but un- 
consciously they were also pro- 
viding fresh air, good food — no 
substandard rations came in the 
airdrops — hard work and, most 
of all, incentive.” 

“Incentive?” Scott asked, puz- 
zled. 

“Sure, incentive. The will to 
live. The urge to survive is never 
stronger than when you’ve been 
cast off somewhere to die. A lot 
did die, of course. But the strong- 
est survived and, in surviving, 
they licked the disease. They’ve 
rehabilitated themselves.” 

“Assuming that,” Scott said, 
“what about the Deimons?” 

“The creatures that attacked 
the Regulars,” George said, “were 
Deimons in everything but form. 

Lane had it figured out the same 
way I did.” 

“Lane?” asked Scott. 

“The leader of the Regulars,” < 
George said. “The man who saved 
my life. He’s responsible for or- 
ganizing these people out of mob 
chaos. He was a crewman on an ' 
Earth-Mars liner. In a nutshell, 
he signed off the ship to set up a 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



business in lopa, got sick, was too 
proud to ask for help, caught the 
nully disease from a Martian wo- 
man who was taking care of him, 
then got rounded up with her.” 

From Lane, when George put 
him on, Scott learned that the 
Regulars had been aware of the 
danger from the fiery globes al- 
most from the first — even before 
George had smuggled himself into 
the colony. They recognized them 
as sensient aliens, though they 
had no idea where they came 
from, and saw them take over the 
newcomers to the colony and 
make them into automata. 

Lane reasoned that the Regu- 
lars were in some way different 
from the new nullies. Then the 
globes tried and failed to inhabit 
the Regulars. He concluded that 
the Regulars not only differed 
from the nullies, but that they 
had been cured of their disease. 

“TIUT knowing something and 
proving it are two entirely 
different things,” Lane told Scott. 
“Who would listen to us? We 
were the forgotten men, complete- 
ly cut off from the outside. Our 
food came from the air. The pi- 
lots ignored the messages we 
wrote on the ground. If they took 
pictures of them, they thought 
they were a trick. The guards at 
the fences had shoot-first instruc- 
tions and none of them ever came 
close enough to talk to.” 



“Rough,” Scott agreed. 

“That was the way things 
stood before your boy George 
Mercer came along. I guess he 
fooled the nullies, but he didn’t 
fool us. George was just too 
smart a lad to be one of them. 
Then, when the globes wouldn’t 
have anything to do with him, 
we knew he was for us.” 

“But he tried to reach you,” 
Scott protested, “and you drove 
him off.” 

“That was a mistake,” Lane 
said. “There was a new guard 
on watch Snd he got rattled. Be- 
lieve me, we looked hard enough 
for him afterward, but didn’t find 
him till that wild spear got him 
during the battle.” 

“That’s reasonable, I suppose,” 
Scott said. But he sounded 
doubtful and George cut back 
into the conversation. 

“What’s the matter, Scott? 
Come on, spill it. I know that 
tone of voice — it means you’re 
full of question marks. Maybe 
you think I really have become 
a nully and this is all a trick to 
get me and my new buddies out. 
Is that it?” 

“Well—” Scott said. 

“Look, Scott,” George said. 
“You’ve got a right to be skep- 
tical. It’d be a terrible thing to 
bring a couple of hundred of us 
out into civilization and then find 
that we were — a sick menace. 
You’d never sleep again, I know.

How can I convince you?” 

“George, it isn’t that — ” 

“I’ve got to convince you. It’s 
true that if I were a nully and 
was trying to kid you, I’d prob- 
ably talk the same way as I am 
now . kid you! That’s it, Scott! 
The kids!” 

“What?” Scott sounded lost. 

“The kids!” George yelled. 
“The children! Send over a plane 
■ and take pictures, if you like. The 
population of the colony at the 
latest census was ninety-eight 
men, two dozen women and quite 
a number of children. There are 
over fifty kids here, Scott.” 

“Children?” said Scott, incred- 
ulous. “But nullies are known to 
be sterile.” 

“They sure are, Scott. That’s 
my point! Nullies are sterile. Ex- 
nullies are not. That’s the clinch- 
er, isn’t it? That’s the trump card 
to play on the Health Commis- 
sion, if they’re as stubborn as 
you are.” 

Scott laughed in relief. “Of 
course,” he said. “I’ve got it now. 
Forgive me for being so slow.” 
He turned to Kathy Brand. 
“Kathy, you heard it all. Get 
through to the Health Commis- 
sion and tell them. George, shall 
we get a party out to you 
tonight?” 

“Tomorrow’ll be time enough, 
Scott. Some of these people have 
been here for ten years. Lane’s 
one of them. Another ten hours 



won’t be an eternity. I’ll be see- 
ing you soon, Scott!” 

G eorge Mercer was sitting 
up in his bed as if it were 
a throne when Scott and Kathy 
visited him in lopa General 
Hospital. 

“Lap of luxury,” George grin- 
ned. “Love it. Love you, too. 
Gorgeous,” he said to Kathy. 
She bent and kissed him on the 
cheek. George winked at Scott. 
“Privileges of the convalescent,” 
he said. 

“How’s the arm?” Scott asked. 
“Coming along. Doc says Lane 
did a first-rate job on it, for an 
amateur. Lane’s just down the 
hall. They’re keeping him under 
observation. If he continues to 
respond to the biopsies and what- 
all, he’ll be discharged in a 
month. His wife, too — the Mar- 
tian woman he got rounded up 
with — and the children and the 
rest of them. How’d we do on 
the story, Scott?” 

“We creamed them. Two- 
hour beat over the nearest op- 
position. And of course they had 
nothing like your eyewitnesser.” 
“Naturally,” George said. “I 
wasn’t a nully for nothing. By the 
way. Doc tells me they’re setting 
aside the new wing of the hospital 
for future nullies. They’ll have 
lots of air, good food and occu- 
pational therapy. Should be able 
to cure ’em in a year. Now if

we could clean up the slums . 

“That’s a job for parliament. 
You’ll follow through on that 
angle when you get back to your 
old beat. But since parliament 
doesn’t reconvene for three 
months, New York thought you 
might like to convalesce on 
Earth for a while.” 

“Oh, no!” George protested. 
“You seem to forget I’m still on 
assignment. You gave me the 
job of getting a story on the fire 
globes. Did I get it? No. They 
censored all that out of my copy 
— made it strictly a yarn about 
the nullies. So I’m still working, 
Chiefie.” 

“You talk like a man with a 
hole in his head, instead of his 
arm,” Scott said. “That’s another 
story entirely, those globes.” 

“You can’t sweet -talk me out 
of it, Scott. When I get out of 
here, I want you to have a little 
spacer waiting for me. Just point 
it at Deimos and I’ll do the rest. 
The Deimons got clobbered at 
the nully colony, sure. But they’ll 



be up to something else and if I’m 
on the job, maybe we won’t be 
scooped by Interplanetary News 
again.” 

“It’s still no — and it isn’t just 
heartless old me saying it. W.G. 
sent a small armada up there and 
Deimos has been off limits for a 
week. We’ll get the story even- 
tually, I suppose, but I have a 
hunch that when we do, it’ll be 
in the form of a communique.” 
George sank back into his pil- 
low. “Shucks,” he said mildly, 
looking at Kathy. Then he 
brightened. “How about Phobos? 
That’s not off limits, is it?” 
“No,” Kathy said. “But why 
would anybody want to go to 
that forsaken rockpile?” 

“We could look for the Pho- 
bosians, you and I,” he said, 
“hand-in-hand in the Marslight, 
strolling from crag to crag.” He 
leered at her. “Anyone for 
Phobos?” 

Kathy grinned back at him. 
“Loon,” she said.

INSIDE STORY 



143 




Here is 1955's first important science 
fiction book— a dazzling literary one- 
man show. Many of the magazines 
these stories appeared in are now 
collector's items that cost as much as 
this whole volume. 



Distinguishing this brilliant collec- 
tion from all others are the vivid notes 
from the author's own working journal, 
giving the thematic origin and back- 
ground of every story. Fascinating for 
readers and immensely valuable for 
writers, they demonstrate the skill and 
bravura that have made H. L. Gold 
an acknowledged master both as 
author and editor of science fiction.

very special extra .
