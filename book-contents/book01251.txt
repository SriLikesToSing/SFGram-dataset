TESTING ENGINES FOR STAGE ONE — The two rocket motors for Stage 
One are mounted here in tandem for test firing prior to installation in the air 
frame. These motors are designed to yield three hundred thousand pounds 
of thrust to lift the three stage assembly. The test crew is stationed in a 
heavily armored vehicle downslope from the test stand to observe the firing. 
The vibration and roar created by these monster engines is inconceivable 
to anyone who has not witnessed such a firing. Men have been known to 
assume the foetal position, or lose control of their bodily functions, under its 
impact. (Now see inside back cover.)

A YEAR from now (and who 
doesn’t know it?) science will em- 
bark on the most colossal probing 
of the mysteries of the universe the 
world has ever known. The occa- 
sion, of course, is the International 
Geophysical Year — an 18-months 
“year” which will last from July 1, 
1957, through December, 1958. 
During this time 40 nations will 
pool their scientific brains to prove 
a lot of things and to disprove a 
lot of other things. Weather, grav- 
ity, outer atmosphere, latitudes 
and longitudes, oceanography, 
earthquakes, glaciology and many 
other pertinent subjects will get 
close clinical scrutiny. It’s going to 
be an exciting 18 months, not only 
for the science minded and the 
science fiction fan but for anyone 
who can read, write, see, feel, smell 
or hear. 

BEGINNING in this issue, we are 
publishing a series of articles that 
may well turn out to be a world 
scoop on anticipating the design 


and functioning of the artificial 
satellite to be launched through 
“Operation Vanguard”, pne of the 
United States’ most prominent con- 
tributions to the IGY — and cer- 
tainly the most dramatic. Since the 
first announcement by President 
Eisenhower, there has been a 
bombardment of newspaper, radio 
and TV stories, but still the public 
has received only a vague, general 
idea of what this first (if Russia 
doesn’t make good its boast) arti- 
ficial satellite is actually going to 
be like. Being a top-secret project, 
this is only natural. And it’s going 
to be a good while before anybody 
gets the Government’s own story. 
However, we did the next best 
thing: we sought the calculated 
predictions of scientists who, though 
not connected with “Project Van- 
guard”, are actively engaged in 
various phases of rocket develop- 
ment — rocket design, propulsion, 
astrophysics, instrumentation and 
other phases of astronautics. They 
are men high in their fields — and, 
we believe, what they present will 
be very, very close to the satellite 
of “Project Vanguard”. The au- 
thors of the first two articles are 
James M. Nuding and Paul J. Van- 
ous, who present a plan for con- 
structing and launching the satel- 
lite vehicle, and the instrumenta- 
tion and operation of the actual 
satellite after it reaches its orbit. 

JAMES M. NUDING is lead Re- 
search Engineer, Atomic Research 
Energy and Problems of Instru- 
mentation, at North American 
Aviation. His rise to eminence has 
the flavor and color of a story by 


2 




Horatio Alger. Born in Oakland, 
California, in 1905, he was or- 
phaned at the age of ten. Through 
training received in technical 
classes in high school and night 
school, he was able to secure a 
license as a radio operator. His 
first job as a radio operator was 
aboard a four-masted barque 
bound for the Bering Sea. From 
“wind jammering” he went to the 
Coast Guard, where he served 
aboard a rum-runner in the same 
capacity. After leaving the Coast 
Guard he had a variety of jobs 
which included experimenting with 
X-ray, glass blowing for neon 
tubes, and work on high-voltage 
electrical systems. 

His first big step upward in the 
field of science was when he went 
to Stanford University to work on 
the Klystron Project, under the 
Varian brothers. (The klystron, in- 
cidentally, is a gadget that makes 
possible U.H.F. transmission.) A 
year later, he went to Sperry Gyro 
to work out commercial applica- 
tions for the klystron. When the 
Sperry laboratories moved east, he 
went to the University of Cali- 
fornia, where he worked, under 
Professor Lawrence, on TUBA, a 
radar- jamming device used in 
World War II. After a short tenure 
here he transferred to the 60-inch 
cyclotron lab, becoming its chief of 
operations. 

In 1942, with the war at fever 
pitch, he was again transferred, this 
time to the Calutron Project, where 
he experimented with an electronic 
device for separating the U235 
isotope for use in the A-bomb. 
Within a year he was a supervisor 


and training head. In 1943 he was 
sent to Oak Ridge and for three 
years he was engaged in work on 
process improvement of the Elec- 
tromagnetic Separation Plant. He 
went to North American Aviation 
in 1946 and has remained there 
since. 

James Nuding is a long time 
member and former president of 
the Pacific Rocket Society, an ac- 
tive group dedicated to the pursuit 
of astronautical research and the 
furtherance of space flight. Under 
the auspices of this organization, he 
became one of the pioneers in the 
actual designing, building and fir- 
ing of many of the successful 
rockets which have roared into 
southern California skies. 

PAUL J. VANOUS, a young man 
of 31 years, is Microwave Senior 
Design Engineer, Missile Guidance 
Systems Division, at Bendix Avia- 
tion. A resident of Burbank, Cali- 
fornia, he holds a degree in Elec- 
trical Engineering from the Uni- 
versity of California and a mem- 
bership card in the Microwave 
Chapter of I.R.E. Much of his time 
is spent flying across the country on 
problems of component develop- 
ment. Mr. Vanous made the orig- 
inal designs and drawings from 
which the interior illustrations and 
June and August covers were 
adapted. 

MUCH MORE could be written 
about James Nuding and Paul 
Vanous. I wish we could run a 
more detailed story about each in- 
stead of this brief introduction.

“Operation Vanguard”, Man’s first skirmish with outer space, 
has fired the imaginations of millions who want to know: 
What will the Satellite actually look like? How will it reach its 
orbit? What instruments will it carry and what will they tell 
us? . Here are the predictions of two eminent rocket men.

T HE THOUGHT that Man the weak sputter that filtered 
might someday contrive to through Dr. Goddard’s basement 
hoist himself by his own bootstraps window has been raised to the shat- 
across the last, and most formi- tering roar of today’s rocket motors, 
dable of the great frontiers into producing horsepower measured in 
Space, has inflamed the imagi- large chunks of a million. Power in 
nation of writers, scientists and lay- amounts almost unimaginable a 
men for many generations. Out of few years ago has come into our 
these imaginations over the years, hands; and with it, the announce- 
have come ideas. From the many ment by the President of the Unit- 
fields of science and engineering ed States that this nation will 
have come concepts and mechan- pioneer in the exploration of the 
ical improvements, until at last space frontier by launching a tem- 

34 



porary satellite into a predeter- 
mined orbital path around the 
Earth. 

This launching of an Earth 
Satellite Vehicle is perhaps the 
most exciting of all the projects 
planned for the - International 
Geophysical Year 1957. The pro- 
gram, known as “Project Van- 
guard”, can, if it is successful, con- 
tribute more to the science of the 
world in general than any other 
single project envisaged. The mere 
fact that the Satellite when 
launched must necessarily fly over 
all the countries of the world, will 
call for a mutual trust and cooper- 
ation between them which will be 
unprecedented. 

Coupled with this is the fact that 
such a Satellite will offer an un- 
paralleled opportunity for science 
to study the physical phenomena 
surrounding the earth. During the 
past hundred years, Man, despite 
being earthbound, has made enor- 
mous strides toward understand- 
ing the universe. However, the lim- 
itations of not being able to mount 
his instruments above the heavy 
blanket of the atmosphere, has 
forced many of the problems to re- 
main unsolved. With today’s knowl- 
edge of rockets and instrumentation 
this need no longer be true. 

There appear to be four main 
objectives to be accomplished in 
“Project Vanguard”, the first of 
which is the testing of the feasibil- 

At right are the dimensions of the 
three-stage Satellite rocket, the Satellite 
itself being the third stage. The “bas- 
ketball” ' shape theory is exploded as 
impractical. The Satellite is here shown 
to be needle-shaped, 19.5 feet long and 
one foot in diameter.

ity of constructing a three stage 
Rocket-Satellite Vehicle and suc- 
cessfully establishing it in an orbit 
around the earth. Viewed from 
the standpoint of an astronautical 
enthusiast, the successful accom- 
plishment of the first objective will 
justify the expense and effort of the 
whole project. However, since pub- 
lic funds are being spent in the fi- 
nancing of the program, other 
things must be accomplished to 
satisfy not only the general public, 
but also the scientists concerned 
with the Geophysical Year. 

The second objective is the in- 
strumentation of the third stage so 
that once in orbit, information of 
interest to the I.G.Y. scientists can 
be collected by it and transmitted 
to strategically placed monitor 
stations on the ground. From the 
viewpoint of the scientists, the ac- 
complishment of the second ob- 
jective will be the main justifi- 
cation; the more diverse the infor- 
mation collected, the more price- 
less the Satellite’s contribution to 
research. 

The knowledge gained by the 
second objective will be of vital 
importance in the accomplishment 
of the next step. This will be the 
planning of larger, more elaborate, 
and possibly manned satellites to 
be built in the future. The third ob- 
jective, we feel, is probably of ma- 
jor interest to the military and, if 
pursued with the proper attitude, 
can be of inestimable value in the 
preservation of world peace. 

The fourth objective is of longer 
range and possibly of somewhat 
visionary character, although one 
which should not be dismissed be- 


cause of the lack of immediacy. It 
is the. exploration of the hazards of 
space and the gaining of knowledge 
of space travel in general. Once a 
space vehicle has been manned, in- 
terplanetary exploration and travel 
will be the next logical step. 

It is well to point out at this time 
that the actual design specifications 
to be used in the satellite project 
will undoubtedly involve rockets 
and instrumentation which are part 
of the military security of the 
United States, and as such have al- 
ready been classified as secret. But 
since the authors of this article 
have no connections with, or 
sources of information from, “Pro- 
ject Vanguard”, it will be interest- 
ing to see how close an “educated 
guess” will bring us to what actually 
develops. 

W E feel that the “basket ball” 
nomenclature was an unfortu- 
nate choice. In the first place, it is 
very unlikely that the Satellite will 
look anything like a basket ball. The 
diameter of a basket ball is roughly 
twelve inches, and in order to put 
such a sphere into an orbit around 
the earth it must be carried there 
by a missile whose diameter must 
necessarily be somewhat larger. The 
missile must contain besides its 
propulsion system and guidance 
mechanism, a device for expulsion 
of the satellite. If this device is to 

Scale at right shows altitudes at which

Nuding and Vanous predict that orbit 
eventually will be 300 miles above 
Earth's surface instead of 200 or 250 
miles .

add any appreciable velocity to 
that already attained from the 
carrier rocket, it will have to con- 
tain additional fuel in the form of 
an explosive charge. This explosive 
and the gun-like mechanism would 
be heavy, requiring many thou- 
sands of pounds of fuel in the first 
and second stages just to get it up 
there. 

Assuming that we have placed a 
“basket ball” in orbit, what of 
value, if anything, will we have? 
A little rough calculation will show 
that a sphere twelve inches in di- 
ameter can contain very little use- 
ful instrumentation. It is possible 
that it could hold a battery oper- 
ated power supply and a small radio 
transmitter of sufficient strength to 
be heard back on earth. By no 
amount of miniaturization how- 
ever, could we squeeze in much of 
anything else. Authorities on upper 
atmosphere research agree that a 
Satellite Vehicle placed in a stable 
orbit 300 miles up could probably 
stay there a year before it fell back 
to earth. If this is so, then ob- 
viously no battery would be suffi- 
cient to power the transmitter for 
that length of time. Also, if the 
Vehicle is going to be circling the 
earth for that period of time, com- 
mon sense dictates that it should 
be so instrumented that full ad- 
vantage be taken of its sojourn in 
space. 

It is true that some useful in- 
formation other than the mechanics 
of getting up there, could be ob- 
tained from an uninstrumented 
Vehicle orbiting around die earth 
at a known altitude and velocity. 
Deviations in its orbital path as a 

38 


function of geographical location 
would provide some clue to the de- 
viations in the earth’s magnetic 
field. Change in orbital velocity 
as a function of time and latitude 
would tell something about the 
density of the residual atmosphere 
through which the Satellite must 
travel as it slowly spirals its way 
back to earth. With the exception 
of these two bits of information, it 
is unlikely that anything of impor- 
tance could be obtained from an 
uninstrumented vehicle. However, 
if the whole third stage of the 
rocket assembly is utilized, as it 
probably will be, the increased 
available volume and the great 
saving in weight will allow a much 
more elaborate instrumentation 
system to be put in orbit, with a cor- 
respondingly greater amount of 
useful information transmitted. 

The designing and building of a 
rocket combination which is ca- 
pable of raising the Satellite Vehicle 
to an altitude of up to 300 miles, is 
in itself an engineering feat of ma- 
jor importance. It is true that the 
United States has already sent a 
two stage rocket (Bumper Project) 
up 250 miles; but one must remem- 
ber that the second stage of Bumper 
was a relatively small rocket with 
a very small payload. This was 
launched vertically and arrived at 
its 250 mile altitude with zero ve- 
locity, whereupon it merely fell 
back to earth. 

In the case of the Satellite’s sec- 
ond stage, it must, while carrying 
the relatively heavy third stage, ar- 
rive at or near the 300 mile goal 
in a fairly horizontal position and 
path. It must also at this time have 

JAMES M. NUDING 



achieved a large fraction of the 
17,400 miles per hour horizontal 
velocity necessary to keep the satel- 
lite in orbit. To do this it is neces- 
sary that stage one and stage two 
be BIG rockets! 


S TAGE ONE will probably be 
larger than any single rocket that 
has ever flown up to this time and 
will most likely consist of two of 
the largest rocket motors built, 
mounted side by side. It will de- 
velop in the neighborhood of 300,- 
000 pounds of dirust for a period 
in excess of one minute. It will be 
about 15 feet in diameter and 
approximately 100 feet high. Its 
total weight will be on the order of 
200,000 pounds, 150,000 pounds of 
which will be liquid fuel and oxi- 
dizer. The fuel will be alcohol or 
some similar liquid and the oxident 
will be liquid oxygen. 

The propulsion system will be a 
modernized version of that used in 
the V2 rockets, i.e. — a steam or 
gas driven turbo-pump which draws 
the fuel and oxident from large 
storage tanks and forces them, at 
about 350 pounds per square inch 
pressure, through spray nozzles and 
combustion chambers where they 
combine and burn. The resultant 
hot gases, escaping through the 
motor nozzles, furnish the impulse 
which causes the assembly to rise. 

Stage one will carry in its upper 
end, just below the socket where 
stage two sits, an electronic “brain” 
which will take controlling im- 
pulses from the master “brain” lo- 
cated in stage three. These im- 
pulses will be amplified and fed 

SATELLITE 


to servo-mechanisms located in 
the tail which will in turn actuate 
the steering vanes on the fins and 
also carbon vanes in the jet stream, 
just below the rocket nozzles. These 
carbon vanes will stabilize the 
rocket during the period in take-off 
when tail fins are ineffective. 

Stage II may well be a Viking 
rocket or one similar in size and 
performance. The small tail fins 
used by the Viking could very well 
be left off in the case of the second 
stage. The motor mounted on a 
gimbal allows it to be swiveled in 
any direction, thus permitting the 
thrust from the jet to be used to 
steer the rocket after it has left the 
atmosphere — where tail fins would 
have nothing to bear against. 

The apparently excessive size of 
Stage I and Stage II is necessitated 
by the fact that nearly all of the 
300 mile altitude and the 17,400 
mile per hour orbital velocity must 
be attained by the second stage so 
that fuel left in Stage III can be 
used for making orbital corrections 
in both position and velocity. 

Stage III, which will also be the 
Satellite itself, should be a rocket 
with the performance character- 
istics of the Aerobee and with a 
guidance system similar to that of 
the Wac Corporal. While it should 
resemble the system of the Wac 
Corporal, it will require a consid- 
erable amount of modification to 
fit it for use as a satellite. This 
would involve mounting the motor 
on gimbals, and the installation of 
hydrogen peroxide jets mounted 
laterally for making altitude and 
roll corrections.

Time reversal exists at the sub-atomic level according to

the strange co-existence of Summer, Mark and Wyn? 



BY CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



W HAT SCIENTIFIC or super- 
natural principle is behind the 
mysterious appearances recorded 
some years ago by Mr. Charles 
Fort, I’m sure I don’t know. It 
could, of course, be the same as 
that behind the sudden appearance 
of Wyndham Storm in Central 
Park, but I don’t believe I’ve heard 
of a case that exactly paralleled this 
one. 

I gather from a perusal of Mr. 
Fort’s works that it is not uncom- 
mon for these unheralded visitors 
to come onstage without the for- 


41 


mality of clothing; but I don’t be- 
lieve it’s customary for them to 
bring their wives along, 

I got caught in a thunderstorm 
that night in Central Park — not 
New York’s Central Park, but Al- 
lertown’s Central Park, which isn’t 
as big. Having no raincoat — the 
skies had appeared clear when I 
left home for the movies — I took 
refuge in the big octagonal band- 
stand. 

The storm was brief, but spec- 
tacular; one of those violent affairs 
that often mark the arrival of a 
cold front to dispel an unusually in- 
tense midsummer heat wave. The 
rain slashed across the park in 
wind-whipped sheets, managing to 
drench me even in my shelter. Big 
trees bowed low and reluctantly 
hurled away leaves and limbs. 
Thunder rolled incessantly and the 
lightning made an eerie daylight of 
the blackness. 

Suddenly, there was a terrific clap 
of thunder and a fiery flash that 
blotted out everything around me. 
Shaken, I picked myself up from 
the floor of the bandstand, still not 
sure I hadn’t been struck. Blue 
smoke was boiling away from a 
wrecked tree about thirty feet away, 
in the midst of a clump of charred, 
waving shrubbery. 

And like Venus rising from the 
foam the naked woman stepped 
out of the shrubbery, followed by 
the naked man. 

My first impulse was to laugh 
at these two whom the storm had 
chased from their hiding place and 
to be astonished at their brashness 
in disrobing completely in the heart 
of the park. Then it occurred to 

42 


me that the lightning must have 
stripped them. They might be hurt. 

I jumped from the bandstand 
and walked swiftly over to them. 
To my utter amazement, the young 
woman promptly threw her arms 
around my neck and said : 

“Whatever has just happened, 
Don, I want you to know it’s you I 
love.” 

Then she kissed me. 

“What on earth!” I exclaimed, 
disengaging myself. The man was 
looking from one to the other of 
us, mutely. 

“I’m Summer Storm and this is 
my husband, Wyn Storm, and we 
live at 138 March Street,” she said, 
all in a rush. “Oh, Don, I’m sorry 
you don’t know us any more, but I 
should have known from the way 
Wyn was acting and everything 
that’s going to happen . .” 

“Wait a minute, wait a minute!” 
I interrupted. “I don’t know you. 
How did you know my name?” 
She didn’t answer, but just stood 
there, looking at me intently. I 
averted my eyes. I was beginning 
to recover from shock enough to be 
embarrassed. 

“How about this?” I asked the 
man. “Why should I know you, 
and where do you come from?” 
“I’m afraid I don’t know,” he 
replied, sounding perfectly honest 
about it. “I’m afraid I don’t re- 
member anything. Do you suppose 
I have amnesia?” 

“That’s possible,” I said. “But 
your wife seems not to be bothered 
with it. All right. Summer Storm 
and Wyn Storm it is— but the 
names are too trite in these circum- 
stances not to be false. Both of 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



you had better get back in the 
shrubbery while I get some help.” 

I found the policeman on the 
Main Street beat. As I thought, it 
was my old friend, Gus Adams. He 
accompanied me back to the park, 
the rain gleaming on his slicker. 

“They picked a good address to 
lie about,” he said, when I had ex- 
plained the situation to him on the 
way. “The house at 138 March 
Street is vacant.” 

“They’re probably spooners who 
got caught by that lightning bolt 
and are too ashamed to give their 
right names,” I said. “If they had 
any clothes, I don’t know what 
happened to them. I didn’t see any 
in those bushes.” 

“What do you figure I ought to 
do with them, Mr. Gracey?” he 
asked. 

“They look like decent young- 
sters,” I said. “If it’s all right with 
you, we’ll take them out. to my 
house until they’re ready to let me 
help them get back where they 
came from,” 

“You’re taking a chance,” he 
grunted. But we wrapped the 
woman in his slicker and tied my 
best suit coat around the man’s 
waist. Gus called the town’s only 
patrol car and had them drive us 
out to my house. 

I suppose nudists and doctors 
eventually reach the point where 
they look on nakedness as normal. 
But, to me, my “orphans of the 
storm” looked a lot more like ,hu- 
man beings when I had them 
clothed in a couple of my old sweat- 
ers and some slacks. 

They might have been twins. For 
all I knew, they were, in spite of 

Z 


the woman’s claim that they were 
man and wife. Their eyes were an 
identical sky-blue, their hair an 
identical pale, wavy gold. Her hair 
was cut short, his needed cutting, 
so they were a good match. I 
judged their ages to be about 23, 
although I’ve been over-estimating 
young women’s ages since I passed 
30. 

“Now, suppose you tell me where 
you’re from and what this is all 
about,” I said sternly, when they 
had finished eating the meal I had 
rustled up for them. 

The man spread his hands and, 
for the first time, he smiled. It was 
the smile of an archangel. What- 
ever the failure of his memory, his 
smile was that of wisdom and pa- 
tience. I was to find, not much 
later, that the woman’s smile was 
its feminine counterpart. 

“I’m afraid I don’t remember 
anything before standing in the 
park in the rain,” said the man. 

“What wrong? What’s wrong, 
Don?” demanded the woman, a 
note of hysteria in her voice. 
“What’s happening to us?” 

“It’s just that I don’t understand 
this situation at all,” I said. “You 
say you’re husband and wife. Then 
you won’t mind both sleeping here 
in the den, and tomorrow we’ll see 
what we can find out.” 

In this remarkable fashion be- 
gan a remarkable fifteen years. 


L ooking back on it, i sup- 

i pose I loved Summer Storm 
from the time I saw her. I’ve been 
trying to decide what that makes 
me. Incestuous? Just narcissistic?' 

43 



Or, perhaps, Jovian? 

She was alone in the den when 
I looked in the next morning be- 
fore breakfast. Wyn — short for 
“Wyndham,” I learned later — was 
wandering around in the back yard, 
looking lost. 

Summer had a pair of my scis- 
sors in her hand, evidently prepar- 
ing to trim her hair. Somewhat to 
my surprise, she looked contrite 
when she saw me. 

“I just thought I might look bet- 
ter with short hair,” she explained. 

“Good Lord, it’s too short now!” 
I exclaimed. “I like women with 
long hair.” 

She hesitated, then reached up 
to begin clipping. Somewhat net- 
tled, I turned on my heel and 
walked out. 

That incident is noteworthy for 
its strange sequel. At breakfast, I 
was thunderstruck to observe that 
Summer Storm’s hair was long — at 
least shoulder length, for it was 
done up in a neat bun behind her 
head. Where in my house had she 
found a wig to match her own 
hair? And how long must the wig 
have been originally, for her to have 
cut from it the long tresses I found 
later in the wastebasket? 

After breakfast, I took Wyn with 
me to check on the house at 138 
March Street. I left Summer at 
home. Although she claimed to re- 
member things and Wyn said he 
couldn’t, I could make nothing of 
her “memories.” There was a 
strangeness about talking with her, 
too, something I couldn’t quite put 
my finger on yet. 

As Gus had said, the house at 
138 March Street was vacant It 

44 


was for rent. The owner, old Al- 
bert Meecham, lived next door, and 
I made an impulsive decision on 
the spot. 

“Your wife insists you live here, 
so you two must be connected with 
this address in some way,” I told 
Wyn. “I’ll rent the place for you 
while we’re trying to run down 
some information on your back- 
ground. If you decide to stay in 
Allertown, you can pay me back 
after you get a job.” 

The only way I knew to probe 
the origins of Wyn and Summer 
was through the customary chan- 
nels. That afternoon, I went down 
to the police station to talk with 
my friend, Gus, before he started 
on his beat. 

The Allertown police station is 
nothing but a room in the ancient 
city hall, a block off Main Street, 
but it does have a separate outside 
entrance. Gus was sitting on a 
bench in the shade by the entrance, 
fanning himself with his cap. The 
perspiration pasted his dark blue 
shirt to his well-padded arms and 
chest. The relief the storm had 
brought hadn’t lasted long. 

I sat down on the other end of 
the bench. 

“Gus,” I said, “can you fellows 
help me find out who those people 
are we picked up in the park last 
night? It’s funny, but the man has 
amnesia, and I think the woman’s 
a little strange in the head.” 

Gus looked at me a little re- 
proachfully. He laid the cap down, 
to pull his handkerchief from his 
hip pocket and mop his brow. 

“You mean that story you told 
me was the truth?” he asked. “I 


CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



thought they might be some rela- 
tives of yours, that had got into 
some sort of a scrape. Both of them 
look a lot like you.” 

“Do they? Well, they’re no rel- 
atives of mine. I’d like to know 
just who they are. Mr. and Mrs. 
Wyndham Storm, she says.” 

“They don’t come from Aller- 
town,” he said. “I’d know them if 
they was from Allertown. But they 
was raised around in this country 
somewhere.” 

“How do you know that?” 
“There’s a way of talking folks 
have around here. You don’t hear 
it outside these three or four coun- 
ties, and you wouldn’t notice it if 
you wasn’t watching for it. Take 
my word for it, those folks was 
bom and raised not fifty miles from 
here.” 

“Well, just to be on die safe 
side, you’d better check to see that 
they’re not wanted criminals,” I 
said. “Amnesia would make a good 
dodge for a criminal.” 

“I’ve already done that,” he said 
quiedy. “The/re not.” 

Wyn and Summer weren’t 
missing persons from anywhere in 
our secdon of the state, either. Gus 
looked into that angle very 
thoroughly dining the next few 
weeks, and reported failure. 

Wyn got a job as clerk at Mc- 
Clellan’s Dry Goods Store and, for 
reasons he did not confide to me, 
enrolled in night classes at Slayden 
College. He and Summer soon 
were established in the neighbor- 
hood as “that nice young couple 
that Don Gracey brought in from 
somewhere out West.” How the 
townspeople got started on that 

Z 


Western origin theory, I don’t 
know; I suppose it’s natural for 
people to tack some sort of an origin 
on strangers. 

I confess that their origin soon 
became a matter of minor impor- 
tance to me, although I remained 
curious about it. I found Wyn ex- 
tremely likeable; we became very 
close friends, although I estimate 
that I am ten to fifteen years older 
than Wyn. And, as I say, I was 
in love with Summer, although it 
was a long time before I admitted 
that to myself. 

I told myself I felt about Sum- 
mer as I would my own daughter, 
if a bachelor like me could say such 
a thing; and I felt toward Wyn as 
though he were my son. There was 
a good deal of accuracy to that 
description of my feelings, but 
there was a mystery about Summer 
that drew me powerfully. 

I think the unattainable in 
woman is always irresistible. Sum- 
mer had the most peculiar air of 
unattainability about her I ever 
have experienced. It was as though, 
when I touched her, it was a fleet- 
ing touch; when I looked at her, 
I was constantly beset by the feel- 
ing that she would, the next instant, 
shimmer into insubstantiality. 

Talking with her heightened this 
illusion, rather than lessening it. A 
conversation with Summer was a 
unique experience. It was a little 
like two people trying to talk at 
once, each talking, then each hesi- 
tating to let the other have his say. 
Our words crossed each other, like 
scissor blades that do not quite 
meet. She might answer a question 
before it was asked, or take the 

45 



conversation off on tangent after 
tangent. Disconnected, discontin- 
uous — those adjectives describe 
our conversations. 

Except for his amnesia, dating 
back to the night in the park, Wyn 
was perfectly normal. After some 
time, he confided that he, too, was 
concerned about Summer’s strange- 
ness. I got the impression from 
him — though he did not go into 
great detail— that it extended be- 
yond her conversation, to her ac- 
tions. 

“It seems to me that I ought 
to know what’s wrong with Sum- 
mer,” he told me, very puzzled 
about it. “I mean, it seems I ought 
to remember. But I don’t. I’ve gone 
so far as to talk it over with her.” 

“What did she say?” I asked. 

“She said she wasn’t going to 
tell me now. She said she’d tell me 
one of these days, but that when 
she did, I’d leave her. She smiled all 
the time she was saying it, in the 
strangest way.” 

Well, we had Summer examined. 
Old Doctor Lodge is no psychia- 
trist, but a man isn’t a general prac- 
titioner for as long as he’s been at 
it without learning something about 
the way a person’s mind ticks. He 
said there was nothing wrong with 
Summer, mentally. 

“She acts like she’s still suffering 
a little from some sort of shock,” 
he said. “If she was right next to 
a lightning bolt when it struck, I’m 
not surprised. It’s lasting a little 
longer than such things usually do, 
but it’ll clear up.” 

It didn’t clear up, but Wyn and 
I got used to it. 

Amateurs, they say, shouldn’t 
46 


fool around with hypnosis, and I 
suppose there’s a sound reason be- 
hind that admonition. But I’m a 
little better than the average ama- 
teur hypnotist. I’ve not only done 
a good deal of it at club benefits 
and what not, but I’ve read pretty 
heavily in psychology. I decided to 
see if hypnotizing Wyn would give 
me any clue to his past and Sum- 
mer’s. 

Summer sat beside me that night 
at their home, as I went through 
the familiar motions and Wyn sank 
into hypnotic trance. 

Under hypnosis, Wyn recalled 
easily everything that had happened 
since that night in the park. But 
attempts to regress him past that 
night brought only a death-like si- 
lence, in which he sat pale and im- 
mobile. I tried several times, and at 
last succeeded in getting him in an 
extremely deep hypnotic state. 

Suddenly, Summer interrupted 
with an exclamation. 

“That’s me!” she exclaimed. 
“That’s what I told him four years 
ago!” 

“Quiet, Summer,” I commanded, 
looking at her curiously. “I think 
I may be able to get something out 
of Wyn now.” 

Despite total lack of response 
when regressed to ages 22 and 20, 
I regressed him to age 18. He 
stirred and murmured. His eyelids 
fluttered. 

“What do you see?” I asked 
eagerly. “What are you doing?” 

“Wyn?” he exclaimed. His voice 
was clear and treble, the voice of a 
woman, as he called his own name. 
He clenched his fists, and moved 
his head from side to side. “Wyn, 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



I’m going to have a baby!” 
“What!” I exploded, amazed. 
“Wyn, what do you see?” 

He opened his eyes. 

“Why, I see you, Don,” he said 
in his normal hearty voice. “What 
else should I see?” 

With a suddenness I never have 
seen before or since, he had come 
out of the hypnotic state. I was 
afraid to delve any deeper. I 
didn’t try hypnosis again. 

During these first few years, Wyn 
and Summer gradually lost that 
identity of appearance which had 
made them look so much like twins 
the night I found them in the 
park. Wyn aged, not excessively 
but as any adult man would age in 
a few years. Summer, on the other 
hand, seemed to have found the 
secret of eternal youth. She grew 
ever more delicate and beautiful, 
and her fair skin seemed to take on 
a translucent glow. 

I was a close friend of the couple, 
and I found that I was alone with 
Summer a good deal. Summer had 
shown an interest in schooling, 
too. She started in college with 
Wyn, then dropped back to high 
school, and finally fell back on 
studying at home. It wasn’t that 
she wasn’t bright. She seemed to 
recognize the facts she was studying 
almost at once, but tests and exam- 
inations were her downfall. She 
never could remember enough of 
the things she had studied to make 
a passing grade. 

So I went to the house at 138 
March Street often in the early 
evenings, to help Summer in her 
studies. 

Z 


Their son was bom about six 
years after they came to Allertown. 
It was a peculiar thing. There was 
no noticeable sign of pregnancy. 
Summer was sure she was preg- 
nant, but Doctor Lodge scoffed at 
her, right up to the time of the 
birth. 

“Sure, she has milk,” he told 
Wyn and me, tugging at his white 
mustache and giving us a wise 
smile. “It’s not unusual. She isn’t 
carrying a child, though. It’s a 
false pregnancy.” 

But the child was bom. Then 
Doctor Lodge reversed himself and 
insisted she was carrying an unborn 
twin. Again he was wrong. Summer 
gradually but steadily recovered 
from the effects of the birth and 
regained her slender figure. 

I still do not attempt to excuse 
Wyn for leaving his wife and new- 
born son. He was overwrought, it’s 
true, but he should have taken them 
with him. 

Instead, he came to me, his suit- 
case packed, when the child was 
about a month old. His face showed 
his agitation. 

“Don, I’m leaving Summer,” he 
said abruptly. 

“Wyn! Why? What’s hap- 
pened?” 

“I found out yesterday why she 
acts and talks so strangely. She told 
me. I couldn’t sleep last night, and 
I’ve decided I must leave Aller- 
town. Somewhere there may be 
people who can help me, but I can’t 
find the help I need here.” 

“Was it so terrible?” I asked, 
trying to calm him. “What did 
she tell you, Wyn?” 

He leaned forward intensely, 

47 



pointing a finger at me, and opened 
his mouth to speak. Then he shut 
it and sat back. He shook his head. 

"No,” he said. "Maybe it 
wouldn’t affect you as it has me, 
but you couldn’t feel comfortable 
about it. All I want from you, Don, 
is the promise that you’ll take care 
of Summer and little Mark for me 
until I come back.” 

"You know I’ll do that. They 
can move in here right away. But 
I think you’re making a mistake, 
running away from whatever it is.” 

"I’m not running away,” he re- 
plied. "I told you, I’ve got to have 
help.” 

That’s all he would say. He left 
on the mid-afternoon train for 
Mayer City, and I went around to 
138 March Street to help move 
his wife and child into my own 
home. 

I didn’t recall until three days 
later that Summer had predicted 
— or so Wyn had said — that when 
she told him why she acted as she 
did, he would leave her. 

I F I CAN’T excuse Wyn for 
leaving his wife and child, I have 
even less excuse for becoming his 
wife’s lover. The fact that the inter- 
lude may have been necessary to 
his very existence — and hers — is no 
justification, for I did not know 
that then. Nor do I know it cer- 
tainly now. 

But picture the plight of a man 
who has in his home a young and 
beautiful woman, the realization 
growing on him, day by day, that 
he has loved her for six years. And 
it was Summer’s fault, as much as 

48 


my own. Perhaps more. Despite 
Wyn’s words, I could not be sure 
that he would return to her, and 
certainly she must have known 
that he would. Despite this, she 
did more than merely encourage 
me. 

I have wondered often about the 
philosophical implications of this 
fact. If Summer had not encour- 
aged me, I wouldn’t have been 
bold enough to make any advances 
on my own account . and where 
would that have left Summer? 

On the other hand, it was the 
most natural thing in the world 
that Summer should encourage me. 
She knew. 

Wyn had been away only about 
two months when Summer, rous- 
ing herself from a deeply pensive 
mood one night, sat down by my 
side on the sofa and snuggled up 
close to me. I couldn’t bring my- 
self to pull away from her, but I 
exclaimed : 

"Summer, this isn’t right. What 
about Wyn?” 

"I don’t understand this cool- 
ness toward me, Don,” she said, 
laying her head on my shoulder. 
"People who love each other 
shouldn’t act so aloof.” 

"I was thunderstruck at this ad- 
mission. But I couldn’t help saying 
what I said then. 

"I do love you, Summer,” I con- 
fessed, almost choking. 

At once she arose and left me. I 
thought I had offended her, and I 
was almost relieved that I had. It 
was best that she should be dis- 
couraged about any ideas she might 
have about me. 

But thirty minutes later she gave 
CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



me a smile that made me not so 
sure she was offended. And the 
incident seemed to increase, rather 
than dampen, the warmth of her 
attitude toward me. 

It was unpardonable, with Wyn 
gone so short a time, but I had no 
strength to resist the inexorable 
attentions of a woman I loved. 
When she came to me in negligee 
late one night a week later, I be- 
came Summer’s lover. 

I have said it was partly Sum- 
mer’s fault, and the sequence of 
events would make it appear al- 
most entirely her fault. This is not 
true; and I found out several years 
later why it is not true. 

My inexcusable affair with Sum- 
mer lasted for about a year, before 
the conversation occurred which 
caused me to terminate it abruptly. 
I had just entered the parlor, where 
Summer was curled in a big chair, 
reading. 

“I don’t see any reason for our 
not loving each other, if we really 
do, Don,” she said petulantly. 
“Wyn says he’s my husband, but I 
don’t feel that he is. Why should 
I be tied by a marriage ceremony 
I don’t know anything about yet?” 

I could not answer, for I was 
looking at her through new eyes. 
Her tone of voice had been so like 
that of an indignant child that it 
awakened me to something I 
should have seen before. 

How like an adolescent girl she 
was, really! The pale gold hair 
framed a young face. Despite the 
rondures of her figure, there was 
a looseness about the way her legs 
were attached to her pelvis, giving 
her frame that impression of hoi- 

Z 


lowness that is frequent among 
slender young virgins. 

In the seven years I had known 
her, how could I ever have built 
up in my mind the picture of her 
as a mature woman? 

When I thought about that sud- 
den protestation of hers, made after 
we had lived as man and wife for 
a year, it seemed to me that it 
could only have arisen from re- 
morse at such a situation. But it 
was neither this nor the fact that 
I was wronging her and Wyn that 
caused me to resolve then and 
there that never again would I so 
much as kiss her. It was that she 
was too young! 

I did not waver in that resolve, 
from that time on. 

But I thought a great deal about 
this matter: I had known Summer 
for seven years and she had been 
a woman when I first saw her. Yet 
her youthful appearance now made 
it impossible that she should have 
been adult then. Surely my memory 
did not play me wrong in picturing 
the Summer Storm I had seen that 
night in the park; indeed, the pic- 
ture of her was burned indelibly 
on my mind. She must have, in the 
interim, become slighter, even 
smaller. 

Oddly, this slenderizing process, 
once I noticed it, seemed reluctant 
to stop. The bathroom scales proved 
that she was losing weight slowly, 
but in her appearance the decline 
progressed much more rapidly. She 
began to get leggy and angular and 
she completely lost the once-volup- 
tuous contours of her body, despite 
all the milk and starchy foods I 
could feed her. Nor was it that she 


49 



lost appetite. She ate voraciously. 

At the same time, I became con- 
vinced she was losing her memory. 
Chance remarks dropped at odd 
times indicated that her recollection 
of Wyn, of the events before Mark’s 
birth, of all her past life in Aller- 
town, was extremely faulty; she 
never had shown signs of remem- 
bering any events before she came 
to Allertown. 

As a matter of fact, it became in- 
creasingly apparent that she no 
longer accepted Mark as her son. 
The boy was growing out of baby- 
hood with that speed which is so 
remarkable in children. She cared 
for him solicitously, but seemed to 
look on him as her little brother. 

Of course, I took her to Doctor 
Lodge. He, in turn, went with us to 
consult doctors at Mayer City. He 
could find nothing wrong with 
Summer physically, nor could they. 

They seemed to think we were 
faking. They heard my assurances, 
and those of Doctor Lodge, that 
Summer must be approaching the 
age of thirty, with obvious skepti- 
cism. 

“There is nothing wrong with 
this girl except an unfortunate 
emotional aberration,” one doctor 
told me flatly. “Physiologically she 
is a girl of about fourteen, and it is 
difficult for me to believe that her 
chronological age is any higher.” 

“As I told you before, she has a 
son nearly four years old,” I said. 

“I don’t say that’s impossible at 
her age, for it isn’t,” he retorted. 
“But this girl has never been a 
mother. She’s a virgin.” 

I should have realized what all 
this meant. I believe there have 

50 


been such cases in medical history 
before. But I suppose I was too 
close to it. I didn’t understand, 
even when Summer reposed child- 
ish confidence in me. 

“I know what’s going to happen, 
you know, because it’s already hap- 
pened to me,” she said. She was a 
skinny girl now, with enormous 
blue eyes. “You know what’s hap- 
pened, because its already hap- 
pened to you. Isn’t it funny?” 
Fortunately, Wyn returned not 
long after that. Wyn had the an- 
swer to the questions that had been 
puzzling me. 

W YN GAVE no warning of his 
return. He just walked into 
the house one afternoon, carrying a 
suitcase and smoking a pipe. 

When I found Wyn and Sum- 
mer in the park, they had appeared 
to be twins. During Wyn’s absence 
his hair had begun to gray — pre- 
maturely, I’m sure — and now he 
looked like Summer’s father. The 
change in her must have been even 
more noticeable to him than it was 
to me, because he had been sepa- 
rated from her during its most re- 
markable development. But he 
showed no surprise at it. 

“I knew what the trouble was be- 
fore I left,” he said soberly. “You 
see, as Summer’s husband I was 
much closer to her than you could 
be, even since she and the boy 
have been living with you.” 

I could feel my ears turning red. 
I asked hurriedly: 

“What is wrong with Summer, 
Wyn?” 

“She lives backwards,” he said. 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



“Time is reversed for her. It isn’t 
only a physiological reversal. Every- 
thing goes backwards in time for 
her. The future is the past to Sum- 
mer, and the past is the unknown 
future. She remembers the future, 
Don — she remembers it, because 
she has seen it happen.” 

“That’s impossible!” I exclaimed. 
“How can she? It hasn’t happened 
yet!” 

“To her it has,” he replied. “It 
may upset your conception of the 
future as a fluid thing of limitless 
possibilities, but Summer’s experi- 
ence is pretty good evidence that it 
is as frozen and stable as the past. 
As the Orientals say, what is to be 
will be.” 

I thought about that, and I 
thought I detected a flaw. 

“Oh, no!” I said. “Wait a min- 
ute here, Wyn. If she can’t re- 
member the past even a minute 
ahead, you couldn’t even talk with 
her. She’d remember what you 
were going to say, instead of what 
you had said. Not only that, she’d 
talk backward! You’d never be able 
to understand her.” 

“People are adaptable,” he re- 
plied. “She evidently learned to talk 
backward — to her; correctly, to us. 
People learn to talk so others can 
understand them. And as for con- 
versation, do you remember Sum- 
mer ever answering a question di- 
rectly?” 

I started to say I did, for it 
seemed that I did. But a moment’s 
reflection changed my mind. Not 
a direct question; and her partici- 
pation in a conversation always 
had been a jumpy and disturbing 
thing. 

Z 


“But we can talk with Sum- 
mer,” I protested. “For years 
we’ve been able to understand each 
other.” 

“Like writing letters that cross 
in the mails,” he said. “And I 
think people do have some knowl- 
edge of the immediate future, even 
you and I. Summer would develop 
that faculty more than the average 
person.” 

Certainly. No wonder she had 
been so affectionate to me that it 
had been impossible for me to re- 
sist her. To her, at that time, we 
had already been lovers. By the 
same token, my own knowledge 
when the affair was concluded that 
we had been lovers must have 
created in me an attitude that was 
a strong incentive for her to yield 
to me at the end of our relation- 
ship — the beginning, to her. 

What a way to live! Always try- 
ing to guess, from the conversation 
of those around her, what (to her) 
was going to happen, so she could 
react intelligently. 

“But,” I protested, still unwilling 
to accept it, “if the past is the 
future to her, her actions could 
affect the past.” 

“Exactly,” he said. “I told you, 
this means you have to accept the 
principle that the past is just as 
mailable as the future, and the 
future is no more mailable than the 
past.” 

Wyn had known all this before 
he left. He had gone, not just to 
avoid seeing his wife revert to child- 
hood before his eyes, but to delve 
into studies on the nature of time 
itself. Where he had been, how he 
had supported himself I didn’t 

51 



know. I still don’t know. 

Summer, her age now about 
thirteen, was old enough to under- 
stand that she was Wyn’s wife, but 
he did not resume his position as 
husband to her. Instead, he acted 
toward her and Mark both as a 
father. Me? I suppose I was some- 
thing in the nature of a benevolent 
uncle now. 

As a matter of fact, Wyn plunged 
so deeply into work that the task 
devolved upon me to be both 
father and mother to Summer and 
her child. Mark, developing apace 
into a vigorous young specimen, 
looked like both his parents — since 
their features were so much alike, 
he could not be said to resemble 
one more than the other. 

Wyn did not return with his 
family to the house at 138 March 
Street. It had long been occupied 
by someone else. He moved in with 
us and, with my tacit consent, made 
my home both his home and the 
headquarters for his work. 

His work actually was double. 
He got a good job, this time as en- 
gineer at the Allertown Mill Indus- 
tries. During all his spare time, he 
worked at converting my precious 
den and my basement into some- 
thing completely beyond my under- 
standing. 

There are some people who ac- 
cept misfortune and live with it — 
or die with it. Others battle it 
angrily to the bitter end, even 
when there is no evidence that any- 
one ever conquered their particular 
misfortune before. Admittedly, 
there was little precedent for Sum- 
mer’s case ; and this made the prog- 
nosis even less optimistic. Still, Wyn 

52 


was constitutionally the latter type 
of person. 

“I don’t know how much longer 
she lived in the past before you 
found us,” he told me. “Nothing I 
could do has helped my amnesia 
for that period. She may have lived 
to a ripe old age, for all I know. 

“But we know that she has only 
a few years to live, the way she is 
now — perhaps twelve or thirteen. 
That’s her physical age, and she is 
living backwards toward baby- 
hood.” 

“What will she do?” I asked 
curiously. “Just fade away?” 

“She has to be born,” he an- 
swered solemnly. “My guess is that, 
a few years in the future, there will 
occur the most unique birth ever 
known to man— a birth in reverse. 
Some couple, somewhere — perhaps 
someone we know here in Aller- 
town — will live through the ex- 
perience of the daughter they never 
knew reentering the mother’s 
womb and retracing her steps 
through the embryo stage to the 
moment of conception.” 
“Fantastic!” I exclaimed. 

“It must be true;” he insisted. “It 
has to be true, unless she reversed 
. will reverse . her direction 
in time after birth. In that case, 
perhaps some baby girl here even 
now is Summer, living coexistently 
with her reversed self.” 

“If you’re going to reverse her 
direction in time again and make 
her live normally,” I said, for he 
already had told. me this was his 
aim, “I don’t see how you can pre- 
vent a paradox. She has already 
lived in the past as an adult woman. 
If you reverse her existence at this 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



stage, then she can’t be born, be- 
cause she’d be living from her pres- 
ent age on, both forward and back- 
ward in time.” 

He shook his head. 

“I don’t know,” he said. “Per- 
haps it can’t be done. Perhaps it 
would involve a parallel time 
stream, if there is such a thing. All 
I know is that I must try. If I 
can, she might still consent to be 
my wife later, if the difference in 
our ages isn’t too great. That would 
be up to her.” 

“I don’t see how you even know 
where to start on such a project,” 
I confessed. 

“The chances are slim,” he ad- 
mitted, “but I have some hope. The 
only actual time reversal we know, 
scientifically, is at the sub-atomic 
level. The theory was advanced by 
Feynman that annihilation of an 
electron-positron pair upon contact 
might be, not actual annihilation, 
but a ‘time reversal’ of the electron. 
The emission of a photon of energy, 
in such cases, is powerful enough to 
cause a recoil in time, and the 
positron is merely the electron 
traveling backward through time 
after the energy explosion.” 

I looked extremely blank. 

“Look,” said Wyn, taking up a 
pencil. He drew a big “Z” on a 
piece of scrap paper, labelling the 
two arms “E” and the connecting 
line “P”. The angles he marked 
“A” and “B:” 

“The flow of Time is from left 
to right,” he explained. “At left is 
the past, at right the future. This 
electron, E, is moving normally 
along at the top of the diagram 

Z 


E 



when it runs into an energy explo- 
sion at A. It reverses itself, going 
back through time as the positron, 
P, until it hits another energy ex- 
plosion at B. Then it is reversed 
again into the right time direction, 
continuing as the electron E, at the 
bottom. You follow the line, as the 
pencil point does in making the Z, 
and it’s a single body. 

“But,” and he drew a vertical 
line through the Z, “we move al- 
ways forward in time. To us, the 
energy explosion at B happens be- 
fore the one at A. Suddenly at B, a 
positron and an electron are created 
out of nothing. The electron at the 
top apparently has nothing to do 
with either of them. But the posi- 
tron moves along and collides with 
it at A, leaving nothing there again 
— except, once more, an apparently 
unrelated electron, the one at the 
bottom of the diagram.” 

“But you’re saying the same 
thing can exist in three places at 
once,” I objected. 

“Exactly, but in one of those 
places, it’s traveling backward in 
time. So, if Summer’s time reversal 


53 



occurred or will occur after birth, 
she may be existing somewhere 
else, as a younger girl, right now; 
besides being here in the house with 
us.” 

“Your example is, as you say, at 
the atomic level,” I said. “How 
can you transfer that into terms of 
human beings?” 

“The only thing I know to do,” 
he said, is to create an energy ex- 
plosion which I know won’t hurt 
Summer physically, but may reverse 
her back to a normal direction. It 
would be like the energy explosion 
that meets the positron at B and 
forces it to continue existence as an 
electron.” 

“It appears to me,” I said slowly, 
trying to grasp the concept, “that 
your explosion at B would have to 
have happened already if it were 
going to happen at all.” 

The amazing thing about it is 
that Wyn, the man who had studied 
all this thoroughly, apparently 
didn’t understand what I meant. It 
just goes to show that he must have 
been right, when he said the future 
is as fixed as the past. 

I T TOOK WYN four years to 
get his equipment ready for a 
test. He explained to me what it 
was supposed to do, but I never 
did get more than a general idea 
of the principle involved. The heart 
of the thing was a heavily wired 
chamber in the basement. 

“The human body can take a lot 
of electricity, if it’s administered 
in the right way,” he said. “If it’s 
administered in the wrong way, 
you’ve electrocuted somebody. 

54 


“I still don’t know whether I've 
probed the secrets of the space-time 
fabric deeply enough to make this 
work, but I think it will reverse the 
charge of every atomic particle in 
the body of whatever is in that 
cubicle. I’m going to put a cat in 
it, as our first time-traveler. 

“We may turn up with a cat and 
an anti-cat, the latter traveling 
backward in time. We may end 
with no cat at all. If so, maybe 
we’ve created an anti-cat in the past 
or maybe we’ve just electrocuted 
a cat.” 

“I don’t see how you expect to 
interpret your results,” I com- 
mented drily. 

“If there’s no cat, I won’t risk 
it,” he answered. “If we double 
our cats, I think we’re on the way 
to something that may help Sum- 
mer.” 

We picked our way through the 
mess of wiring and went upstairs. 
He had torn my bookcases out of 
one wall of the den and installed a 
control board with a television 
screen where the fireplace had been. 

“The experiment will be con- 
trolled from here,” he said. “The 
energies that are going to run 
around all over the basement would 
make it pretty dangerous for any- 
one down there. I’m sorry you 
can’t watch, but somebody’s got to 
keep the children away from here.” 

When he said “children,” he 
meant Summer and Mark. Sum- 
mer now looked as much a twin 
to her nine-year-old son as she had 
looked to her husband when I first 
saw them. At the last two Christ- 
mases, we had bought toys for 
both of them, and she played 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



happily with Mark. She called 
Wyn “daddy” and me “Uncle 
Don,” just as Mark did. 

Making them look even more 
like twins as we entered the living 
room on the day of Wyn’s experi- 
ment was the fact that they were 
dressed alike. She wore a pair of 
Mark’s overalls, and both had on 
T-shirts. 

At the moment, the two were 
trying to put doll clothes on 
Thomas, the stray yellow cat Wyn 
had picked up for his experiment. 
We had had Thomas about six 
months now. Wyn and I had 
dubbed the animal “Tom,” un- 
aware of its sex — it had borne kit- 
tens during its stay with us — but the 
children thought the cat too digni- 
fied for the nickname. It was, ex- 
cept when they were trying out 
their various original ideas on it. 

“Thomas is our first heroine — or 
martyr,” said Wyn, and swept the 
cat up from the floor. Over the 
protests of the children, he stripped 
off the doll clothing. “You young- 
sters go out on the side lawn and 
play. Uncle Don will take care of 
you for a while.” 

Caring for the children had been 
my chore for so long I was accus- 
tomed to the peculiarities involved. 
Mark was as much a problem as 
any normal, active boy — no more. 
But Summer’s reverse living, her re- 
verse memory, made her even more 
difficult to deal with as she reverted 
to childish habits and attitudes. 

For some weeks now, she had 
indulged in the fantasy that she 
was Mark and Mark was she, a 
game Mark rebelled at strenuously. 
At the same time, her manner of 

Z 


speaking had become so confused 
and tangled that it was often in- 
coherent. If Wyn failed in his ex- 
periment, the next nine years 
threatened to be trying indeed. 

The children left the house with 
me docilely enough, but as soon as 
we reached the lawn Mark burst 
into tears. 

“What’s the matter with you, 
young fellow?” I asked in surprise. 

“What’s Daddy going to do to 
Thomas?” he demanded. “Daddy’s 
going to hurt Thomas!” 

“Don’t worry, Thomas isn’t going 
to hurt,” I reassured him, aware 
that I might not be telling the 
truth. 

The boy looked at me straight 
“I know what a martyr is,” he 
said indignantly, his sobs subsiding. 
“I studied Joan of Arc in school.” 
“Daddy . Thomas in big fur- 
nace put,” Summer informed us in 
her labored fashion. “Thomas all 
burnt up was going to. Him . but 
I him saved. Saved him, Summer 
and I.” 

“Neither one of you is going to 
do anything about Thomas right 
now,” I said brusquely, recognizing 
Summer’s use of the past tense as 
an expression of intention. “When 
Daddy’s through with Thomas, you 
may play with him again.” 

Mark subsided, but he retained 
on his face a rebellious expression 
which had by now become familiar 
to me. Summer, although she said 
nothing for a few moments, became 
more excited. She alternately 
flushed and paled, breathing hard, 
until I began to fear she was ill. 

Now a deep, powerful hum arose 
from the house. Wyn had switched 

55 



on the power and was ready for his 
experiment. 

It was a tremendous volume of 
sound, a physical thing that 
throbbed through the ground un- 
der our feet and caused the leaves 
of the trees to tremble as in a 
breeze. An electric tension filled the 
air and seemed to intensify Sum- 
mer’s agitation. Her eyes dilated 
in fright and her teeth began to 
chatter. 

“Away got I but!” she cried sud- 
denly in a shrill voice. “Up blew it 
before away ran he and Thomas 
saved I! Me with up blew it and 
fire of full furnace big a was it! 
Furnace a in Thomas had they!” 

“Here, child!” I shouted above 
the increasing roar of the genera- 
tors. “You’re hysterical. Nothing’s 
going to happen to Thomas.” 

She quieted abruptly, glaring at 
Mark in affright. He stared back, 
equally alarmed. 

“He isn’t, Summer he’s?” she 
asked me plaintively. “Boy a be 
Summer could how? Mark I’m 
know I.” 

I didn’t understand this at all, 
especially when Summer began 
feeling her arms and legs and in- 
specting herself all over, carefully. 

The sound of the machinery in 
the basement reached a shrieking 
crescendo that must have put the 
teeth of everyone in the neighbor- 
hood on edge. Mark came to life. 
His eyes shining fiercely, he grasped 
Summer by the arm. 

“Are they going to hurt 
Thomas?” he demanded intently. 
“Are they, Summer?” 

She looked at me, not the boy, 
and suddenly she was calm as 

56 


though in the grip of profound 
shock. I could hardly hear her 
quiet, childish voice through the 
noise from the basement. 

“Where . know . don’t,” she 
began haltingly. “Gone . Sum- 
mer’s but. Furnace the in him had 
they. Thomas saved I.” 

Her voice trailed to a gurgle and 
then she began to chant, “Bum 
Thomas bum Thomas bum 
Thomas . .” 

The boy suddenly broke from her 
and began to run for the house. 

And, BACKWARD, she ran 
after him. 

Caught by surprise, it was a mo- 
ment before I could gather my wits 
and follow, shouting at them. They 
had disappeared around the cor- 
ner of the house, and I rounded it 
in time to see them tug open the 
outside basement door and vanish 
inside. An eerie blue light flickered 
from the open door. 

Trying to run too fast, I tripped 
over the garden hose and fell. I 
got to my feet, momentarily dazed. 

The explosion knocked me flat 
on my back, blinded by the flash 
that burst from the basement win* 
dows and through the cracking 
walls. 

The blast tilted the den up from 
the bottom. Its metal and concrete 
floor, reinforced for the experi- 
ment, buckled but remained un- 
broken, like a giant slide. Down 
that slide, through the smashed 
walls, Wyn catapulted, to fall un- 
hurt into the grass. 

But the rest of the house crum- 
pled in on the basement and caught 
fire. Under the blazing piles of 
ruins, I could only surmise, were 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 



trapped the children, both mother 
and son. 

I wept frantically. At my age, I 
must have been a pitiful spectacle. 
Neighbors put their arms around 
my shoulders, tried to comfort me. 

In contrast, Wyn was remarkably 
calm as he reported to Gus Adams. 

“Every precaution was taken, 
Mr. Adams,” he said, staring mo- 
rosely into the smoking embers of 
the house. “Both of them ran into 
the basement just before the ex- 
plosion. There was nothing anyone 
could do after that.” 

“Too bad, Mr. Storm, to lose 
your wife and son all at once,” said 
Gus sympathetically, writing in his 
report book. We had kept Summer 
pretty well concealed behind the 
high board fence in recent years, 
so few people were aware of her 
retrogression. “If there’s anything I 
can do to help, let me know.” 

I upbraided Wyn for his appar- 
ent callousness when we got to a 
room at the City Hotel. 

“You may be right,” he said. 
“But, first, I want to know some- 
thing.” 

He had me relate to him every- 
thing that had transpired with the 
children after we left the house. He 
made me repeat several points and 
questioned me closely. He was in- 
terested particularly in what Sum- 
mer had said, how she had said it 
and how she had acted. The whole 
thing was so clearly impressed on 
my mind, as it is today, that I’m 
sure I made few errors. 

“Well,” he said, when I had fin- 
ished, “we’ll never see either of 
them again, but I think I can say 

Z 


definitely they weren’t killed in that 
explosion.” 

“I don’t see how you can say 
that!” I exclaimed. 

“You remember what I told you 
— that if Summer’s existence had 
been reversed in time after she was 
bom, she was existing somewhere 
else at the same time? Living nor- 
mally as a younger child in one 
place, and as we knew her in re- 
verse?” 

I did remember it. 

“Well, she was. But we thought 
she’d be a girl in both instances. 
When her time direction was re- 
versed, so was her sex. Mark and 
Summer were the same person!* 9 

I gasped. Wyn took a piece of 
hotel stationery from the rickety 
desk and scratched a zigzag on it 
with his pen. It was a figure like 
the one he had drawn in the library 
of our home, except that the top 
arm of this Z was very short. 

He labelled the top arm of the Z 
“Mark,” and the diagonal “Sum- 
mer.” 

“My mistake was that I thought 
my energy explosion would be at B, 
throwing Summer back into a nor- 
mal time direction. Instead, it was 
at A, reversing the time direction 
of Mark’s existence: and the re- 
versed Mark was Summer.” 

“But Mark was Summer’s son.” 
I exclaimed. 

“Curious, isn’t it?” he agreed, 
smiling strangely. “She gave birth 
to herself, like the phoenix. Nor is 
that all. She conceived herself!” 

With a firm hand, he wrote 
“Wyn” above the bottom arm of 
the Z! 

The diagram looked like this: 


57 



MARK 



“The re-reversal !” His blue eyes 
were a little self conscious as they 
looked at me now. “Don, I was 
bom Mark Storm. This explosion 
today reversed my time direction 
and I became Summer Storm, to 
give birth to myself nine years ago. 
And in a terrific burst of natural 
energy that you yourself saw, a 
crucible so fiery that it could 
wrench the very inner fabric and 
physical form of the body, the time 
flow for me was twisted back to its 
proper direction that night in the 
park and I became myself — to 
father myself six years later! 

“I was my mother. I am my own 
father and my own son!” 

There it is. Wyn believes he 
sprang from nothingness, from 
himself. Amid the wreckage of the 
laws of cause and effect that this 
whole thing involves, it’s possible, 
I suppose. But a couple of details 
still bother me, details I haven’t 


mentioned to Wyn. 

Oh, it isn’t the coincidences. If 
the future is fixed as is the past, 
they wouldn’t necessarily be coin- 
cidences: things like Summer—in 
the reversed time in which she 
lived— stripping off her clothes, 
donning Gus Adams’ raincoat over 
her nakedness and going with us 
out to the park, to that rendezvous 
with the lightning and Wyn. 

One of the details I can’t take is 
that it’s hard to believe that, even 
in such strange twistings and turn- 
ings of time, any creature can in- 
itiate itself and, in effect, spring 
from nothing — though Wyn says 
it’s done at the sub-atomic level in 
simple terms of conversion of en- 
ergy to matter. But how about the 
fact that such a complicated crea- 
ture as man is built by the action 
of the genes and chromosomes? 

The other is that year that I was 
Summer’s lover. If she was living 
backward biologically, wouldn’t 
that apply, too, to the growth of an 
unborn child while it was still part 
of her. And Wyn left Allertown 
right after Mark’s birth. 

I’ve heard of virgin mothers. I’d 
rather believe in a “virgin father” 
than human creation from nothing- 
ness. 

I once had hair, and it was 
blond. My eyes are blue. I look in 
the mirror, and then I look at Wyn 
lounging at ease behind his news- 
paper. 

My son? My motherless son?

Wellesley was ordered to check on deviants 


or mutants. But the evidence was often 


subtle, and he knew he couldn’t afford to 


take a chance . 


the scam per ers 

BY CHARLES A. STEARNS 


T HE EARTHMAN, Wellesley, came to Ophir 
in the season of aphelion, when the binary suns 
of that remote planet were cold serpent’s eyes, dim- 
ly seen above the chill mists that shrouded its fern 
forests and craggy, young mountains, its silent 
oceans and magnificent organ pipe cities of legend. 

From space one might look down upon the vista 
of these latter prominences and imagine a vast, 
exotic civilization spread over the face of the 
equinoctial swamps, but Wellesley knew that the 
giant towers were mere calcareous shells, hollow as 
the expectations they had inspired in the first 


61 




planeteers to arrive here two hun- 
dred years ago— they were the 
work, in fact, of small, mindless 
crustaceans. 

His own destination, a small, 
shabby, corporate plantation, was 
less impressive in appearance. Its 
name was Aidennsport. It consisted 
of a hundred buildings, including a 
commissary and a hulking com- 
munal storehouse. The primordial 
jungle was all about it. 

To Wellesley, yellow-cheeked 
from too many years in space, cyn- 
ical from the paucity of human 
values in his life, Aidennsport was 
the despised prototype of colonial 
stagnation about the galactic rim. 
For he was a dour, lanky pessimist 
among that immense, invaluable, 
but nondescript order of men, the 
Rift constabulary, wjiose beat is the 
emptiness between the stars, and 
which enforces the name of law 
throughout the vast reaches of the 
firmament beyond Sol’s sprawling 
civilization. 

Wellesley’s ship was accustomed 
to describe an elliptical orbit which 
brought it near the system contain- 
ing Ophir once every seventh side- 
real month. It never stopped. Its 
course was an inexorable as a 
comet’s; nevertheless, he had lately 
received the commission of an er- 
rand here for the omnipotent De- 
partment of Genetics and Gene- 
alogical Records. 

And so he was forced to make 
landfall in a rocket tender in a 
meadow by Aidennsport, while the 
ground quaked dangerously be- 
neath the settling blasts of the tiny 
vessel. He located the single course 
of the village without difficulty. 

62 


Half a dozen ragged children were 
playing there, and stopped to stare. 
Women peered at his dark uniform 
from behind curtains in the stained, 
milk-colored bungalows. Quaintly 
dressed men, tending the auto-pick- 
ers in nearby fields of drug-plant, 
shaded their eyes to gaze with si- 
lent menace, though there was no 
sun. 

He was able to find the house of 
the agent by the frayed company 
flag flying over it. To the right of it 
was the warehouse where the an- 
nual crop of senna-like leaves of 
the drug-plant were stored for dry- 
ing. This was Aidennsport’s meagre 
industry. Beyond lay the swamp, 
and far across its desolate surface, 
the multi-colored towers of the 
pipes fingered the sky, aloof and 
sinister in aspect. 

A boy of no more than ten, dark 
eyed but with that startling, bur- 
nished-gold complexion so often 
found in the systems of twin or 
multiple suns, sat upon the steps 
before the cottage. He was playing 
with a furry animal not unlike a 
Martian ferrax, which sprang up, 
scarlet-eyed and bristling, at the 
sight of Wellesley. 

“Here, boy,” said Wellesley, who 
neither liked nor trusted children. 
“Is this the house of Amos Sealilly, 
the factor of Aidennsport?” 

“Sure. That’s my pa. Say, are 
you a spaceman?” 

“Never mind that. Where is your 
father?” 

“In the warehouse,” the boy said. 
“I’ll show you how to get inside. 
My name’s Joseph, and I have a 
spaceship in the back yard. I call it 
the Stygia, after the pirate ship of 

CHARLES A. STEARNS 



the twenty-eighth century* Do you 
want to see my crew?” 

“Later, perhaps,” said Wellesley 
dryly. “Come along, now*” 

They found tall, aluminum doors 
which slid back at the wave of a 
hand, and entered into a vastness 
of cool gloom, permeated by a 
spicelike odor of curing leaves. 

A figure emerged from the dry- 
ing racks at the other end of die 
warehouse. 

“Is that you , Joseph ?" 

“That’s pa,” Joseph said. 

“Damn you, Joseph!” 

“I guess he’s drunk,” Joseph said. 

Wellesley advanced. “I am Lieu- 
tenant Wellesley of the Rift po- 
lice,” he said. 

Amos Sealilly was a great, craggy 
ruin of a man, with seamed face 
and heavy grey brows that shad- 
owed intense blue eyes. Eyes that 
glared just now. “What do you 
want here?” he bellowed. 

“My mission is to perform an 
ethnic census for the Bureau of 
Genetics. I shall require your co- 
operation.” 

“There are three hundred and 
twelve people in Aidennsport,” 
Sealilly said. “Write that down and 
get out. Go back to your space 
castle and leave us alone.” 

Wellesley sighed. “I am afraid 
that an ethnic census is never quite 
that simple. However, since you are 
required by law to assist me, you 
may as well know the truth. This 

community is suspected of inbreed- 

• » 
mg. 

Inbreeding is not, of course, a 
crime, except against nature. Nor 
is it ordinarily dangerous. Com- 

THE SCAMPERERS 


bined, however, with the environ- 
mental influences of certain Rim 
planets, it may cause genuine, true- 
breeding mutations within the 
species, such as monsters, impres- 
siono-telepaths, psycho-variants and 
other undesirables which, if al- 
lowed to multiply for a few genera- 
tions, might become dominant. 
They are located and deported to 
A-type worlds. 

It had been an anonymous tip 
that had brought Wellesley to 
Ophir, but in all the inhabited uni- 
verse, he knew, the Bureau was the 
sole guardian of the classic blood 
strain, and it took no chances. 

“What’s ‘inbreeding,’ pa?” said 
Joseph, tugging solemnly at his 
father’s sleeve. 

“A naughty word of the middle 
ages,” said Sealilly thickly. “A bug- 
aboo of the mighty sky-chiefs. If we 
do not co-operate we bring their 
lightning upon our heads. Yet, 
what must we do?” 

Wellesley did not smile. “You 
must inform the colonists that I 
wish to interview each member of 
every family and clan briefly, be- 
ginning tomorrow morning at 
seven. I do not mind in the least 
being persona non grata, but if any 
person fails to show up, or if there 
is any trouble, you will be held per- 
sonally responsible. Moreover, I do 
not think you are as drunk as you 
would like me to believe.” 

Amos Sealilly bowed, took a flask 
from his pocket and drained it. 

“One other thing. I shall need a 
place to sleep.” 

Sealilly smiled. “There is an 
abandoned native daub-hut behind 
my house. You are welcome to it.” 

63 



“It will serve,” answered Welles- 
ley coldly. “There are natives in the 
area then?” 

“Yes. Bipeds, though not mam- 
malian, you will find. In fact, quite 
low in the scale of evolution. They 
are nearsighted and harmless by 
day, but you will be wise to keep to 
your hut after dark.” 

“I can take care of myself.” 

“I’ll show you the place,” Joseph 
offered. “I can carry your space kit, 
too.” 

“Over there is my ship,” Joseph 
said, pointing. “We are making 
ready to put out for Arcturus.” 

There was a bright constancy 
about Joseph that clutched at the 
heart. Not Lieutenant Wellesley’s 
heart, of course, he reminded him- 
self. The “ship” was indeed the 
rusty, peaked foretank from some 
ancient freighter, complete with 
hatch. It was set on end at the edge 
Of the swamp. To any boy it would 
have been a starship. 

It was already dusk. The Ophir- 
ian daub-hut was not so bad as he 
expected. It was massive. The ori- 
fice had been enlarged into a door. 
Windows had been added. The 
only furnishing was the rude couch. 
It was a measure of Sealilly’s hos- 
tility. 

Joseph spied the ferrax-thing 
scuttling across the lawn and dived 
at it. The two of them rolled over 
and over, Joseph laughing, the ani- 
mal growling and spitting. 

Wellesley went in, closed the 
door and removed his official log 
from its case. The next two hours 
were spent in a carefully worded 
account — for space logs are part of 

64 


the permanent records of the Ga- 
lactic Court, among others — of the 
events of the day, including a bleak 
and perhaps prejudiced account of 
the character of Aidennsport and 
of Amos Sealilly. 

Afterwards he lay back on the 
couch and smoked several cigarettes 
in lieu of the food capsules that he 
did not crave. He was far from 
imaginative; nevertheless, the char- 
acter of the place crept at last into 
his consciousness. He was used to 
cramped, machinery-filled spaces 
and the sterile smells of hot metal 
and ozone ; here was an aura of de- 
caying organic matter — and of 
something else. A faint, but unmis- 
takable reptilian odor, attesting to 
the nature of past inhabitants. 

The vault of darkness was abso- 
lute, unabated by the dim patches 
of light that were the fenestrations 
above where he lay. 

And presently someone very 
stealthily opened the door and en- 
tered. 

Only for an instant was the fig- 
ure silhouetted there before the 
door closed and darkness reigned 
supreme once more. Yet that in- 
stant was long enough to tell him 
that it had been a woman. And 
though her features had not been 
discernible, he had gotten the im- 
pression of exceptional beauty. 

For a time there was no move- 
ment; no sound save her faint 
breathing. “Who’s there?” he said. 
“What do you want?” 

And then she came nearer and 
stood so close to him that the per- 
fume of her breath was upon his 
face. Suddenly he groped, caught 

CHARLES A. STEARNS 



her arm and pulled her to him. The 
warmth of her body was against 
him. He felt her tremble. But she 
did not try to pull away. 

He laughed. “Perhaps I may re- 
vise my opinion of Ophir,” he said. 

“No light!” she whispered. Her 
voice was low and vibrant. 

“Why not?” 

“I must not be seen here. But I 
had to warn you. It would not have 
been right not to warn you about 
Aidennsport.” 

“What of Aidennsport?” 

“It is a dreadful — an evil place. 
There are forces here which you 
would not understand. Leave at 
once while you are still able to go!” 
“You forget that I am a police- 
man. To leave without completing 
the census would be dereliction. I 
remind you that the Empire is in- 
exorable in these things. And who 
are you, anyway?” 

She did not answer, but drew 
away so quickly that he could not 
grasp her. In a moment, from across 
the room her voice came. It was less 
intimate, even matter-of-fact. 

“If you will not leave,” she said, 
“lock this door behind me and do 
not, as you value your life, step out- 
side this hut until daylight.” 

She was suddenly gone and he 
was alone in mystification and won- 
der, and a dull, stirring anger that 
he could not account for. 

But he could make nothing of it 
and after a time he put the incident 
resolutely out of his mind and tried 
to sleep. This was not accomplished 
at once. Curious sounds had begun 
to filter in through the fenestra- 
tions. Some were the night sounds 
of birds or insects. Other sounds, 

THE SCAMPERERS 


faint hissings and gruntings, were 
unidentifiable. Once he thought he 
heard the slap-slap of bare feet 
running past his door. 

At last he was forced to employ 
a mild form of auto-suggestion* 
learned long ago and employed 
often during those first lonely years 
in space. He slept. 

But once, in the early hours of 
morning, he was awakened by a 
tumult. There was much loud hiss- 
ing and the scampering of many 
feet outside the daub-hut, as though 
some intricate and riotous game 
might be in progress out there, the 
nature Of the game — or for that 
matter, the players — unguessed at. 
But he was half asleep, and thought 
little of it until he awoke again at 
daybreak. 

T HE AUTHORITY of the Rift 
constabulary is acknowledged 
universally, though sometimes 
grudgingly. The men of Aidenns- 
port, therefore, sullenly reported to 
Wellesley, and brought their fam- 
ilies. 

It is a singular thing, but almost 
every birth and death in the galaxy 
is recorded by the Empire. The 
laws concerning this are old and 
stringently enforced. Therefore 
Wellesley already had a fairly ac- 
curate estimate of the true popula- 
tion of Aidennsport, and it came 
close to the number offered by 
Amos Sealilly. 

Following the seldom-used man- 
ual of the Bureau, he received vital 
statistics, made micro-photos and 
dermal prints, and endeavored .a 
minute scrutiny of every man, 

65 



woman and child that passed be- 
fore him. He was finished by mid- 
afternoon. 

Evidence of ingeneration he 
found in plenty, in the marked 
similarity of features among certain 
families, but nothing which could 
be called deviation or mutation. 
Not even polydactylism, which is 
one of the earlier manifestations. 
Still, he knew that the physical im- 
press of the mutant was often sub- 
tle, and that he might have over- 
looked something. 

In none of the females could he 
identify the girl of last evening. If 
she had failed to appear — was hid- 
ing in the village — might not others 
be hiding too? 

The only recourse was to study 
the natives and try again. In many 
cases deviation among homo sapi- 
ens , who had colonized the Rim 
planets, simulated the natural char- 
acteristics of native races. The re- 
lationship between mutation and 
environment was obvious. 

The chief magistrate, factor, or 
leader of any colony with an official 
grant was required by law to assist 
and obey any member of the Rift 
police in the capacity of a deputy. 

Wellesley called Amos Sealilly, 
who had been avoiding him all day. 
“Is there a tribe of the dominant 
native species near here?” he asked. 

Sealilly was still drinking, and 
saluted stiffly. “In the swamp, Lieu- 
tenant.” 

“Guide me there.” 

“You can go to hell,” Sealilly 
said, “and I will guide you there ” 

“You refuse?” 

“I do. It’s too dangerous for a 
spaceman. Full of bog-fever. 

66 


You’ve no natural resistance. Be- 
sides, I’m busy inventorying.” 
“Very well,” Wellesley said, 
struggling to hold his temper in 
check, “I’ll find them alone.” 

“In which case,” said Sealilly, 
“you will not come back, and that 
will be an irreparable loss to the 
Empire.” 

Wellesley left him and made his 
way toward the swamp. Joseph was 
playing near his ship, and calling 
orders to an imaginary crew in- 
side. When he saw Wellesley he 
came running. 

“We were just blasting off for 
Earth,” he said, “but I heard you 
and Pa talking. If you want to go 
in the swamp. I’ll show you the 
way. I’ve been there lots. The 
Ophirians hang out on the shores 
of the black lake, where the organ 
pipes are.” He pointed to the tow- 
ering pinnacles in the distance. 
“They catch shellfish there.” 

“You know them?” 

“Everybody has seen them. They 
are kind of green and slimy, but 
they won’t hurt you. They can’t see 
in the day-time. Only smell. Any- 
way, I’m not afraid of them.” 
“Done,” said Wellesley, “and in 
return for the favor I promise to 
put in a word for you at the nearest 
spaceman’s hiring hall.” 

“You won’t have to do that,” 
Joseph said. “My crew and I are 
going to be space pirates.” 

Then Wellesley laughed aloud, 
and felt better afterward than he 
had felt in many a long month. 

The trail through the swamp was 
damp and primitive. Everywhere 
the cycads, giant ferns and reeds 

CHARLES A. STEARNS 



overhung the path. There were 
great, blood-colored flowers which 
snapped at twigs that Joseph put 
into their corollas. 

Meanwhile, the ferrax-beast la- 
bored behind them, following with 
its proboscis to the ground, until 
the boy, taking pity, picked it up 
and carried it. Wellesley asked its 
name. 

“His name is Omur,” Joseph 
said. “I caught him in the moun- 
tains when he was little and raised 
him. But now Omur is too fat to 
walk.” 

Eventually they emerged into an 
open swale, with a stretch of dark 
water before them. On the other 
side of the slough lay a sight well 
worth a day’s march. Dozens of 
giant pipes, some two hundred feet 
or more in height, stood braced 
against the sky, pastel blue, pink, 
and gold in the mists. 

But Wellesley was less interested 
in these than the creatures which 
moved like grubs about their base, 
at the edge of the lake — squat, gro- 
tesque forms that waded the shal- 
low water, scavenging for shellfish 
and crustaceans, and took no no- 
tice of the humans. 

On coming nearer, however, 
Wellesley observed a very curious 
fact. The Ophirians were of two 
varieties. The ones in the mud were 
gross and toadlike in appearance. 
Whenever they found an especial 
delicacy they would run, with their 
webbed feet making smacking 
sounds in the shoal water, and lay 
it at the feet of an Ophirian who 
sat in a wallow of peat moss and 
mud, and did nothing. He was a 
much smaller variety, but, Welles- 

THE SCAMPERERS 


ley noted, with considerably greater 
frontal development to his skull. 
Also his thin body bore a long, 
green tail. The tails of the workers 
were vestigial. 

“The chief?” Wellesley asked. 

“No,” Joseph said. “It’s some- 
thing else.” 

“Are they a clan, then, or 
brothers?” 

“Closer than brothers,” Joseph 
said, scratching Omur’s head. 

“I have it — avatars! I should 
have guessed!” He had heard of 
this odd genetic arrangement be- 
fore, but never witnessed it. In such 
cases a dozen or more individuals 
were bom of a single nucleus in a 
single egg. Of these, one developed 
more fully than the rest and con- 
trolled his mentally-stunted avatars 
with a mental vinculum far more 
fundamental and powerful than 
mere telepathic union. On the 
other hand, the avatars were his 
hands and feet, and had larger 
bodies. 

The large-headed Ophirian sat 
in his wallow and accepted the food 
offered him with long, leathery fin- 
gers. He crunched noisily. Once he 
turned to stare at them briefly with 
great, owl eyes. Eleven avatars 
turned simultaneously to stare. It 
was like looking into a multiple 
mirror. 

“They sense us,” Joseph said, 
“but they can’t see us. Come on.” 

From nearby, the pipes were 
even more awe-inspiring. Besides 
the massive old towers there were 
smaller ones in every stage of de- 
velopment. It was incredible to 
think that they were actually grow- 
ing; pushing up out of the lake. 

67 



In one of them a jagged hole, 
five or six feet in circumference, 
had been broken at the base. Jo- 
seph, with his furry pet under his 
arm, went to investigate it. 

A moment later there came a 
shout from him that brought Wel- 
lesley running. “What’s the mat- 
ter?” 

“Omur went up the pipe,” Jo- 
seph said, “but you can get him.” 
There were tears in his eyes. Be- 
seeching tears. 

“We’ll see,” said Lieutenant 
Wellesley brusquely. He put his 
head inside the pipe. A tiny circle 
of light far above him showed at 
what an awesome height was the 
upper rim. The inner surface, how- 
ever, was very rough, and there 
were plenty of holds for hands and 
feet. He could not see Omur; only 
the circle of light, and around it, 
blackness. Suppose the damned 
thing bit him when he tried to 
rescue it! A faint, moaning sound 
emanated from the vast funnel, 
doubtless from the updraft. 

He found a place for his foot; 
drew himself up a step; then an- 
other. Joseph’s white face was star- 
ing up at him from below. And 
suddenly the circle of light was 
blotted out! 


T HERE WAS a rustling sound 
like dry leaves in the wind, and 
a sudden, sharp pain in his temple. 
Then another at the base of his 
neck. He fell back and sprang out 
into the open. The aperture, in an 
instant, was full of small, needle- 
like fluttering things. 

“Stingbats!” Joseph screamed. 

68 


“Run!” 

Wellesley fled after him, but he 
was already beginning to feel a 
sick, draining weakness. Within a 
few steps his legs had become rub- 
bery. Joseph was out of sight. Per- 
haps gone for help. But then Jo- 
seph did not know that he had 
been stung. 

After a while he came to a small, 
black pond in his path. He had got- 
ten off the trail. He sank down, 
there, beneath a fern tree, cursing. 

He was sure that he was dying, 
for a numbness, an absence of feel- 
ing, had stolen up from his feet and 
possessed his legs. He essayed a bit- 
ter smile. He was more chagrined 
than afraid, for this was an igno- 
minious way to pass, here in a 
nameless swamp, alone, not even 
beset by one worthy enemy. And 
perhaps when he thought he smiled, 
he was merely baring his teeth in 
that manner that certain neurotox- 
ins leave their corpses always . 

Someone was shaking him bru- 
tally and insistently, and someone 
was repeating his name, over and 
over. He knew the voice at once, 
for it had been lately in his 
thoughts. 

“Get up!” she said. 

“I can’t.” 

“You must — or die. (Jet up now 
and try to walk. Come, I’ll help 
you.” 

She did help him, and with her 
support he managed to get to his 
knees and then to his feet. He 
walked. 

Afterward, there was a kind of 
delirium. He remembered bitter 
tasting capsules which she made 

CHARLES A. STEARNS 



him swallow later on in the daub- 
hut, but he did not recall having 
arrived there. He only knew that it 
was pleasant to have her cool hands 
on his forehead. The hands seemed 
to fill a vast, fundamental need. 
And this was out-of-character for 
Lieutenant Wellesley. 

After a w r hile he was lucid, and 
was surprised to note that, as at 
their other meeting, the darkness 
was absolute. “It’s night,” he said. 
“Very dark.” 

“Yes.” 

“Give me your hand.” 

He held it for a time in both his 
own. It was a firm, capable hand 
with long, tapering fingers. “Be- 
lieve that I am grateful,” Wellesley 
said, “even though I must be grate- 
ful to a benefactor whom I have yet 
to see for the first time. Let me look 
at you. I cannot command you to 
tell me who you are, as an officer 
of the Rift constabulary, but I ask 
it as your friend.” 

“You ask the impossible,” she 
said. “The worst is over for you, 
but there may be still another shock 
to come. You must stay here until 
you are stronger, and then I will 
help you escape. Now I had better 
go, before— before I am missed.” 
He heard her retreating footsteps 
and the closing of the door. 

Escape from what ? he wondered 
vaguely. The poison, or the anti- 
dote seemed to have brought about 
some curious psychological change 
in him. He could not think with 
the old, clear incisiveness. The 
drive was gone, the purposefulness 
of his mission to Ophir. He was like 
Samson shorn — or a man taken 
with void amentia whose mind be- 


comes as a child’s. 

And it was so dark. A horrible 
suspicion arose in his mind. He 
searched for, and found the torch 
that was in his kit. He turned it on. 
Nothing happened. No beam of 
light shot out to illuminate the ceil- 
ing. He clicked the switch several 
times, then held the lens against 
his cheek. It was warm, all right. 

He was stone blind. 


W ELLESLEY was not un- 
learned in the physiological 
sciences. He guessed that the blind- 
ness might be temporary — a result 
of neural shock, but that was scant 
consolation. 

Now it seemed to him that since 
his arrival an invisible pattern of 
ill-will had been forming up around 
him. An ugly something lurking be- 
neath the sullen surface of this 
strange village. A malignant force, 
beyond doubt, that well knew his 
true mission on Ophir. 

Now he was helpless, incapable 
of concerted action. He could not 
even retreat, but only lie and listen 
and wait. Now it was their move. 
The terrors of the blind were apt to 
be blind terrors indeed. 

The sounds were not long in be- 
ginning. At first an indistinct mur- 
mur. Then something — or someone 
— scampered swiftly past his door. 
He got up and locked it; then lay 
back, spent by the exertion. Pres- 
ently the running and scampering 
began in earnest. And a hissing and 
squealing such as might have ema- 
nated from all the fiends in Hell. 
Once there came .a scratching at 
the door. 


THE SCAMPERERS 


69 



An hour passed like a century. 
The sounds had gradually died 
away into an absolute silence that 
was much worse. He waited. 

There came a knock at the door. 

He sat up quickly. “Who is it?” 

“It’s me — Joseph ” 

He unlocked the door and the 
boy came in with light, eager tread. 
“You all right?” he said. 

“Yes — yes, I’m all right. But I 
can’t see. Tell me, what time is it?” 

“It’s nearly morning.” 

“Thank God! Now listen care- 
fully. Do you know what a strategic 
withdrawal is?” 

“Sure, everybody knows that. 
Every spaceman, I mean.” 

“Good. It is time for me to with- 
draw to my patrol monitor in space 
and make a radio report. Will you 
guide me to the rocket? There may 
be danger.” 

“I’m not afraid,” Joseph said. 
“Come on, I know a short cut.” 

Wellesley slung his space kit over 
his shoulder and followed, with his 
hand on Joseph’s collar. They went 
out into the night air which smelled 
fresh and clean after the daub-hut, 
and revived him a little. 

At first he walked easily, for the 
ground was level, but after a min- 
ute or two the growth became 
heavy underfoot, causing him to 
stumble, and reeds were whipping 
against his face. 

Presently they halted. 

“Why have we stopped?” Welles- 
ley asked. 

“Here we are,” Joseph said. 

“We couldn’t have gotten there 
in such a short time. Not even by a 
short cut.” 

“Put your hand out before you,” 
70 


Joseph commanded. “You’ll see. I 
guess we can blast off any time.” 
There was a sound of feet, scram- 
bling up a steel ladder. A moment 
later he could hear Joseph’s voice 
from inside, echoing hollowly. 

He put his hand out and touched 
the ladder. The rungs were flaked 
with heavy rust beneath his finger. 
“This is not my rocket!” 

“It’s my rocket,” said Joseph’s 
disembodied voice, from somewhere 
above his head. 

Wellesley cursed him. 

“It’s the fastest ship in the uni- 
verse,” Joseph said. “ Where you 
going?” 

Black anger possessed him, but 
the keen instinct of orientation 
common to men who have lived in 
interstellar space worked for his 
salvation. He might have blundered 
into the swamp, but he did not. In- 
stead he came up, after a terrible 
half-hour, against the wall of a 
building which, by its immense ex- 
tent, could only have been the 
warehouse. He moved along its 
sheer, featureless side until he came 
to a door, which reoriented him, 
then struck out in the direction that 
he guessed the daub-hut to be. 

He bumped against it at last, lo- 
cated its door, flung himself in and 
thankfully bolted it behind him. 

But he was not alone. She was 
there, waiting for him. He started 
when she spoke. 

“Where have you been?” she 
breathed. “I have been terrified. I 
found the hut empty and I was 
sure that you were dead.” 

“Like a bad penny,” he said, “I 
return. But your being here is good 

CHARLES A. STEARNS 



fortune. I am certain that you will 
consent to leading a blind man to 
his ship without resorting to child- 
ish trickery. In fact, I shall make 
sure of it.” 

“Not now,” she said. “It is too 
dangerous. We could never get 
through the swamp. Besides, you 
must still be weak from the effects 
of the poison. Let us wait until 
morning.” 

He seized her wrists and 
squeezed. 

“You’re hurting me!” she cried. 

“Then waste no time. And if you 
try to break way, or lead me into a 
trap, I’ll snap your wrist like a 
straw!” He dragged her to the 
door. 

“Through the village is best,” 
she said. “They are sure to see us, 
but in the open we may be able to 
outrun them.” 

“Who is sure to see us?” 

“Never mind that now. Follow 
me! 

Their flight had a father dream- 
like quality because nothing im- 
peded them, even beyond the vil- 
lage. Miraculously she seemed to 
guide him where no underbrush or 
tangling grasses caught his feet, so 
that not once did he fall. 

“There it is, just ahead,” she 
said. “The rocket tubes appear to 
have sunk into the mud two or 
three feet, though. Do you think 
you will be able to take off?” 

“It will not matter in the least,” 
he said. “But tell me, is it still 
dark?” 

“Yes.” 

“Quite dark?” 

“Very dark,” she said. 

“That’s all I wanted to know. 


Open the airlock and climb up. I’ll 
follow.” 

Once aboard, he found the con- 
trols and set them for take-off. 
Then he pressed a small button. 
The port began to swing shut. He 
heard her run toward it, but he 
caught her and held her until the 
heavy hatch had banged shut with 
a hiss of escaping air. 

“Let me go,” she whimpered. 
“What are you going to do to me?” 
“You are under civil arrest,” he 
said harshly. 

“But I haven’t done anything. I 
have helped you.” 

“Of course. But you forget that 
I represent law — not justice. Once 
I told you that I could be ruthless. 
You see, whoever you are, you are 
what I came here to find. I have 
suspected all along; now I am cer- 
tain.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You brought me here without 
losing the way. Then, from a hun- 
dred feet away you saw that this 
rocket tender had settled two feet 
into mud. All this in absolute dark- 
ness, That must mean that you 
have night sight — like the natives, 
a sure sign of abnormality. Besides 
that, you have consistently avoided 
me in daylight. Meaning that I 
must not get a glimpse of you, even 
though you were able to see me 
quite well. You were the reason for 
Sealilly’s hostility. He wanted to get 
rid of me before I found out about 
you. Joseph, the normal child, was 
used as a decoy to mislead me. But 
Joseph’s sister was a mutant.” 

She fell to the deck, sobbing, as 
he throttled full power for the 
blast-off. 


THE SCAMPERERS 


71 



W ELLESLEY left Ophir a 
small, grey-green globe in the 
vastness of black space and set an 
automatic course for the mother 
ship, where he intended to submit 
a detailed report by radio to Re- 
gional Headquarters on Rigel 
Twelve. 

So far as he was concerned, the 
case was closed, once they were 
aboard the patrol ship, but it was 
three weeks to the vicinity of Rigel, 
and in that time a curious sequel 
had developed. 

The girl (her name turned out 
to be Laura) had stopped crying, 
and had begun to take an interest 
in life once more. In fact, he 
sensed that she was studying him a 
great deal of late. 

They were standing before the 
viewport, she looking at the great 
angry mass of Rigel, magnified in 
the glass, but actually still two 
days ahead, he listening to every 
sound aboard the huge ship as he 
had learned to listen since the dark- 
ness closed in on Ophir. 

She spoke. “How will it be on 
Rigel Twelve? Will I ever see you 
again?” 

“Will you care?” he said. 
“Perhaps I ought to hate you, 
but it is only because you are blind 
that you can not understand. On 
Ophir I was not happy, but at least 
it was home. Out there they may 
laugh at me. It is exciting and won- 
derful, but terrifying.” 

“They will not laugh at you. You 
will be allowed to live on any ap- 
proved planet that you wish, and 
choose your own profession. You 
will be trained at the expense of 
the Empire. And in a few years

you may be allowed to visit your 
father and brother on Ophir. Only 
visit , I mean. Does that sound 
so bad?” 

“But if they laugh — ” 

“I am not laughing,” said Welles- 
ley, with a strange lump in his 
throat. 

“You might if you could see me. 
I’m too dark. My eyes are too big. 
My ears are too small.” 

“I can see you,” he said. 

“Is it true!” She clasped his 
shoulders. “But when — how long?” 

“Since this morning, a little. The 
effect of the venom is passing. Now 
I can see you perfectly, and you are 
beautiful. Strange, and — and beau- 
tiful.” 

And she was. 

“Do not go to Rigel Twelve. 
Stay with me,” he said. (It was 
Wellesley’s misfortune that he al- 
ways sounded like a policeman 
making an arrest, but she kissed 
him anyway.) 

And he thought what a fool 
Amos Sealilly had been. 

But Amos Sealilly had had 
troubles of his own. It was the eve- 
ning after Wellesley had taken 
leave of Ophir forever. Sealilly 
dreaded the coming night, as he 
always did, and had fortified him- 
self against it. He was drunk, but 
not drunk enough. 

The warehouse was locked for 
the day. He was walking toward 
the house, lurching a little, and 
mumbling curses as he did so. Then 
he spied Joseph. 

Joseph, a small figure in the 
dusk, had just climbed out of the 
rusty old peak-tank at the edge of 

CHARLES A. STEARNS 



the swamp. He had furnished it 
with a bunk, as befit a well-found 
spaceship, and often slept there. 

The fact was that he had been 
sleeping there all day, having been 
up all night. Joseph did not go to 
school. He yawned and stretched. 

Amos Sealilly went on to the 
house, and started to shut the door 
behind him, but Joseph, coming up 
behind him, pushed it open and 
came in. He was breathing hard, 
having hurried to catch up with 
his father. He asked : 

“What about the spaceman ?” 
“What about him?” 

“Was he lost in the swamp?” 
“Where did you get that idea?” 
Sealilly said. “He made it. Took 
off before you were up this mom* 
ing, just before dawn.” 

“I was up,” Joseph said. “I 
thought it was a meteorite. Damn!” 
He stamped his small foot. 

Sealilly grinned thinly. “Laura 
went with him.” 

Joseph’s face whitened. “Laura? 
Damn him! Damn her too.” 

“You always hated her,” said 
Seallilly, taking the bottle out of 
his pocket and sucking it. “She 
was too normal for you to stomach, 
I guess.” 


“I would’ve got him if he hadn’t 
run away like a yellow dog,” Joseph 
said. “The stingbats would have 
done it if she hadn’t interfered. 
And then this morning I had him, 
too.” He was thoughtful for a mo- 
ment. “Who do you suppose tipped 
him off?” 

And he watched his father’s 
pasty face. 

“Who?” 

Sealilly laughed. 

“All right,” Joseph hissed. “I’ll 
get you for that. You wanted to get 
rid of me, I’ll bet. But you got rid 
of her instead.” 

But Sealilly continued to laugh, 
inside, because this was almost as 
good as getting rid of Joseph, hav- 
ing Laura out of his clutches at 
last. 

“Me and my crew will fix you for 
that,” Joseph said bitterly. 

And with that, his avatars came 
crowding in behind him, squat, 
powerful and ugly, their saucer 
eyes intent upon Sealilly. 

He had been through it several 
times before, but this time he 
screamed a little bit before it was 
over. He could not get away from 
Joseph, of course. There was too 
many of him. • • •

SATELLITE 


( Continued from page 39 ) 

E stablishing a satellite in 

its orbit is an extremely critical 
operation, which if improperly car- 
ried out could result in an orbit so 
eccentric that even though the sat- 
ellite had the correct orbital ve- 
locity, it could re-enter the earth’s 
atmosphere in less than one revolu- 
tion around the earth. This of 
course, would result in its destruc- 
tion. In fact, there are an infinite 
number of orbital paths possible 
depending on the attitude of the 
rocket while it is achieving its or- 
bital velocity. Common sense there- 
fore dictates that it be possible to 
make corrections in its course after 
it has arrived at the proper altitude. 

It seems likely that if an instru- 
mented third stage is used as the 
Satellite, the control and sequenc- 
ing mechanism for all three stages 
will be carried in the third stage. 
This will include, besides a stabi- 
lized platform which acts as a point 
of reference for the guidance sys- 
tem, an integrating accelerometer. 
This device integrates the acceler- 
ation achieved by each stage, so 
that after a predetermined amount 
of velocity has been gained, the fuel 
is shut off and the stage is dropped. 
This is extremely important in 
order that the final stage will ar- 
rive at maximum altitude with the 
proper orbital velocity. 

As each stage is exhausted, it is 
dropped and the control will be 
transferred to the next higher stage 
which will then carry on through 
its programmed flight until it has 
contributed its part to the altitude/ 
velocity/attitude picture. It would 


be of great advantage if the Stage 
III could arrive in its orbit with 
enough fuel left in its tanks so 
that observers on the ground could 
use its radio receiver to make minor 
adjustments in its course and ve- 
locity. It would then be possible to 
more nearly approach an optimum 
orbit, which would prolong the 
satellite’s stay in space. 

It is possible that Stage I, which 
will be a huge and costly affair, 
might be recovered by parachute; 
since it will be spent at an altitude 
of somewhere between ten and 
twenty miles. Stage II, however, 
will go so high and attain such ve- 
locity that frictional heat developed 
as it re-enters the atmosphere will 
destroy it. As announced, the 
three stage rocket will be launched 
at the Government’s long distance 
rocket proving grounds on the 
Florida coast. This location will 
provide a good 5,000 miles of 
practically unobstructed ocean for 
the spent rockets to fall into, as 
well as a number of strategically 
placed islands which are already 
equipped with the instrumentation 
for tracking long distance military 
rockets. 

It is practically impossible to do 
more than briefly touch on the im- 
mense technical complexities in- 
volved in getting such a small un- 
manned vehicle into space even 
temporarily. However, the second 
article, which will appear in the 
next issue of IF, will discuss in con- 
siderable detail the probable make- 
up of the third-stage Satellite Ve- 
hicle itself, as well as instrumenta- 
tion of monitor stations. • • •

Alarms plan might save the 
race from extinction — but he 
was the clan's only husband 
and had to be protected from 
his own folly . 


B EFORE THE first shots rang 
out, Alan had been sitting with 
some twenty young people of the 
Wolf clan in a grove of aspen ap- 
proximately half way between the 
fields and the citadel on the hill- 
top. He had been teaching them 
myth-legend and, as usual, the girls 
were bored and unbelieving, the 
boys open mouthed. 

He realized, even as he spoke, 
diat the telling had changed even 
since his own youth. As a boy of 
ten, before it was definitely known 
whether or not he was a sterilie, 
he had sat at the feet of the Turtle 
clan's husband as open mouthed 
as those who sat at his feet now. 
But the telling was different. Now, 
had he spoken openly of when 
men bore weapons and women 
lived at home with the children, 
he would have crossed the boun- 
daries of decency. It hadn’t been so 
in his own youth, but then, when 
he was a boy, they had been one

generation nearer to the old days, 
which weren’t so far back after 
all. 

Helen complained, “This is so 
silly, Alan. Why don’t you tell us 
something about . well, about 
hunting, or true fighting?” 

He looked at her. Gould this 
be a daughter of his? Tall for her 
fourteen years and straight, clear 
of eye, aggressive and brooking of 
no nonsense. The old books told 
of the femininity of women, but . 

The shots went bang , bang, bang, 
from below, faint in the half mile 
or more of distance. And then 
bang, bang again and several 
booms from the new muzzle loading 
muskets. 

Helen was on her feet first, her 
eyes flashing. Instantly she was in 
command. “Alan,” she snapped. 
“Quick, to the citadel. All of you 
boys, hurry! To the citadel!” 

She whirled to her older class- 
mates. “Ruth, Margo, Jenny, Paula. 
Get stones, sharp stones. You 
younger girls go with Alan. See if 
you can help at the citadel. We’ll 
come last. Hurry Alan.” 

Alan was already off, herding the 
boys before him. Possibly all of them 
were sterilies and so wouldn’t 
count. But you never knew. 

As they climbed the hill, he 
looked back over his shoulder. 
Down in the fields he could see the 
workers scattering for their weapons 
and for cover. One stumbled and 
was down. In the distance he 
couldn’t make out whether she had 
fallen accidentally or been wounded. 
Further beyond the fields he could 
see the smoke from a half dozen or 
more places where the shots had 



originated. It didn’t seem to be an 
attack in force. 

Not far up the hill from the field 
workers, on a overhanging boulder 
in a lookout position, he could 
make out Vivian, the scout chief. 
She sat, seemingly in unconcerned 
ease, one elbow supported on a 
knee as her telescoped rifle went 
crack, cracky crack. If he knew 
Vivian there was more than one 
casualty among the raiders. 

Who could it be this time? Deer 
from the south, Coyote or Horse 
from the east? Possibly Eagles, 
Crows or Dogs from Denver way. 
The clan couldn’t stand much 
more of this pressure. It was the 
third raid in six months. They 
couldn’t stand it and put in a crop, 
nor could the drain on the arsenal 
be maintained. He had heard that 
the Turtle clan, near Colorado 
Springs, the clan of his birth, had 
got to the point where they were 
using bows and arrows even for 
defense. If so, it wouldn’t be long 
before they would be losing their 
husband. 

He was puffing somewhat by the 
time they reached the citadel. Helen 
and her four girls were coming 
much more slowly, watching the 
progress of the fight below them, 
keeping their eyes peeled for a 
possible break through of individ- 
ual enemies. The stones in their 
hands were pathetically brave. 

The rounded citadel building, 
stone built, loopholed for rifles, 
loomed before them. He swung 
open the door and hurried inside. 

“Hello, honey,” a strange voice 
said pseudo-pleasantly. “Hey, you’re 
kind of cute.” 

92 


Alan’s eyes went from the two 
figures before him, automatic rifles 
cuddled under their arms, to the 
two Wolf clan sentries collapsed in 
their own blood on the floor. They 
had paid for lack of vigilance with 
their lives. 

He could see that the strangers 
were of different clans by their 
kilts, one a Horse the other a 
Crow. This would mean two clans 
had united in order to raid the 
Wolves and that, in turn, would 
mean the Wolves were outnum- 
bered as much as two to one. 

“Relax, darling,” the second one 
said, a lewd quality in her voice. 
“Nothing’s going to happen to you.” 
Her eyes took in the dozen boys 
ranging in age from five to twelve. 
“Look like a bunch of sterilies to 
me,” she sneered. “Get them up 
above, and those girls too. You 
stay here where we can watch you, 
honey.” 

The Crow went to a small win- 
dow, stared down below. “Wanda 
is holding them pretty well but 
they’re beginning to work their way 
back in this direction.” She laughed 
harshly. “These Wolves never could 
fight.” 

Her companion fingered the 
Bren gun which lay on the heavy 
table top in the round room’s cen- 
ter. Aside from four equally heav- 
ily constructed chairs the table was 
the large room’s sole furniture. 
While Alan was ushering the boys 
and younger girls up to the second 
floor where they would be safe, 
the Horse said musingly, “We could 
turn this loose on them even at this 
distance.” 

The crow shook her head. “No. 

MACK REYNOLDS 



It’ll be better to wait until they’re 
closer. Besides, by that time Peggy 
and her group’ll be coming up from 
the arroyo. There won’t be a Wolf 
left half an hour from now.” 

Alan, his stomach empty, stared 
out the loophole nearest him. 

One of the women said, grinning, 
“You better get away from there, 
honey. Make you sick. That’s a 
mighty pretty suit you’ve got on. 
Make it yourself?” 

“No,” Alan said. As a matter of 
fact one of the sterilies had made 
it. 

She laughed. “Well, don’t be so 
uppity. You’re going to have to 
learn how to be nice to me, you 
know.” 

Both of them laughed, but Alan 
said nothing. He wondered how 
long the women of these clans had 
been without a husband. 

Down below he could make out 
the progress of the fighting and 
then realized the battle plan of the 
aggressors. They must have planned 
it for months, waiting until the 
season was such that practically the 
whole Wolf clan, and particularly 
the fighters, would be at work in 
the fields. They’d sent these two 
scouts, probably their best warriors, 
to take the citadel by stealth. Only 
two of them, more would have been 
conspicuous. 

They had then, with a limited 
force, opened fire on the field 
workers, pinning them down tem- 
porarily. 

Meanwhile, the main body was 
ascending the arroyo to the left, 
completely hidden from the de- 
fending forces although they would 
have been in open sight from 

AFTER SOME TOMORROW 


above had the citadel remained un- 
captured. 

Alan could see plainly what the 
next fifteen minutes would mean. 
The Wolf clan would draw back 
on the citadel, Vivian and her 
younger warriors bringing up the 
rear. When they broke into the 
clear and started the last dash for 
the safety of their fortress, they 
would be in the open and at the 
mercy of the crossfire from arroyo 
and citadel. 

If only these two had failed in 
their attempt to . 

The Crow woman said, “Look 
at this. Five young brats with stones 
in their hands. What do you say?” 

It was Helen and her four girls. 

Alan said, “They’re only chil- 
dren! You can’t . 

“You be quiet, sweetheart. We 
can’t be bothered with you.” 

The Horse said, “Two years from 
now they’ll all be warriors. Here, 
let me turn this on them.” 

Alan closed his eyes and he 
wanted to retch as he heard the 
automatic rifle speak out in five 
short bursts. In spite of himself 
he opened them again. Helen, his 
first born, Paula, his second. Ruth, 
Margo and Jenny, all his children. 
They were crumbled like rag dolls, 
fifty feet from the citadel door. 

Now he was able to tell himself 
that he should have called out a 
warning. One or two of them, at 
least, might have escaped. Might 
have escaped to warn the approach- 
ing fighters of the trap behind them. 
Tradition had been too strong 
within him, the tradition that a 
man did not interfere in the busi- 
ness of the warriors, that war was 

93 



a thing apart. 

Jenny’s body moved, stirred 
again, and she tried to drag herself 
away. Little Jenny, twelve years 
old. The rifle spat just once again 
and she slumped forward and re- 
mained quiet. 

“Little bitch,” the Crow woman 
said. 

The heavy chair was in his hands 
and high above his head, he had 
brought it down on her before the 
rage of his hate had allowed him 
to think of what he was doing. The 
chair splintered but there was still 
a good half of it in his hands when 
he spun on the Horse woman. She 
stepped back, her eyes wide in dis- 
belief. As her companion went 
down, the side of her face and her 
scalp welling blood, the Horse at 
first brought up her rifle and then, 
in despair, tried to reverse it to use 
its butt as a club. 

She was stumbling backward, try- 
ing to get out of the way of his im- 
provised weapon, when her heel 
caught on the body of one of the 
fallen Wolf sentries. She tried to 
catch herself, her eyes still staring 
horrified disbelief, even as he 
caught her over the head, and then 
once again. He beat her, beat her 
hysterically, until he knew she must 
be dead. 

He worked now in a mental 
vacuum, all but unconsciously. He 
ran to the stair bottom and called, 
“Come down,” his voice was shrill. 
“Alice, Tommy, all of you.” 

T HEY CAME, hesitantly, and 
when they saw the shambles of 
the room stared at him with as 

94 * 


much disbelief as had the enemy 
women. He pointed a finger at the 
oldest of the girls. “Alice,” he said, 
“you’ve been given instruction by 
the warriors. How is the Bren gun 
fired?” 

The eleven year old bug eyed at 
him. “But you’re a husband, 
Alan .” 

“How is it fired?” he shrilled. 
“Unless you tell me, there will be 
no Wolf clan left!” 

He lugged the heavy gun to the 
window, mounted it there as he 
had seen the women do in practice. 

“Tommy,” he said to a thirteen 
year old boy. “Quick, get me a pan 
of ammunition.” 

“I can’t,” Tommy all but wailed. 

“Get it!” 

“I can t. It’s . it’s unmanly !” 
Tommy melted into a sea of tears, 
utterly confused. 

“Maureen,” Alan snapped, cooler 
now. “Get me a pan of ammunition 
for the Bren gun. Quickly. Alice, 
show me how the gun is charged.” 

Alice was at his side, trying to 
explain. He would have let her take 
over had she been larger, but he 
knew she couldn’t handle the 
bucking of the weapon. Maureen 
had returned with the ammunition, 
slipped it expertly into place. She 
too had had instructions in the 
gun’s operation. 

Alan ran his eyes down the ar- 
royo. There were possibly forty of 
them, Horses and Crows — well 
armed, he could see. Less than a 
quarter of them had the new muz- 
zle loaders being resorted to by 
many as ammunition stocks for the 
old arms became increasingly rare. 
The others had ancient arms, rifles, 

MACK REYNOLDS 



both military and sport, one or two 
tommy guns. 

He waited another three or four 
minutes, one eye cocked on the 
progress of the running battle be- 
low. Vivian, the scout chief, had 
dropped back to take over com- 
mand of the younger warriors. She 
was probably beginning to smell a 
rat. The intensity of fire wasn’t 
such as to suggest a large body of 
enemy. 

The women in the arroyo were 
placed now as he wanted them. 
He forced himself to keep his eyes 
open as he pressed the trigger. 

Blat, blat, blat . 

The gun spoke, kicking high the 
dust and gravel before the Horse 
and Crow warriors advancing up 
the arroyo. 

They stopped, startled. The cit- 
adel was supposedly in their hands. 

They reversed themselves and 
scurried back to get out of their ex- 
posed position. 

He touched the trigger again. 
Blat , blat, blat. The heavy slugs 
tore up the arroyo wall behind 
them, they could retreat no further 
without running into his fire. 

They stopped, confused. 

Alan said, “Maureen, get an- 
other pan of ammunition. I’ll have 
to hold them there until Vivian 
comes up. Alice, run down to the 
matriarch and tell her about the 
warriors in the arroyo. Quickly, 
now.” 

Little Alice said sourly, “A hus- 
band shouldn’t interfere in warrior 
affairs,” but she went. 

When Vivian strode into the 
citadel she had her sniper rifle 

AFTER SOME TOMORROW 


slung over her back and was ad- 
miring a tommy gun she had taken 
from one of the captured Horses. 
“Perfect,” she said, stroking the 
stock. “Perfect shape. And they 
seem to have worlds of ammunition 
too. Must have made some kind of 
deal with the Denver clans.” 

Her eyes swept the room and her 
mouth turned down in sour amuse- 
ment. The Horse woman was dead 
and the Crow had by no,w been 
marched off to take her place with 
the other prisoners who were be- 
ing held in the stone corral. 

“What warriors,” she said con- 
temptuously. “A man overcomes 
two of them. Two of them, mind 
you.” She looked at Alan, the re- 
action was upon his now and he 
was white faced and couldn’t keep 
his hands from trembling. “What 
a cutie you turned out to be. Who 
ever heard of such a thing?” 

Alan said, defensively, “They 
didn’t expect it. I took them un- 
awares.” 

Vivian laughed aloud, her even 
white teeth sparkling in the redness 
of her lips. She was tall, shapely, a 
twenty-five year old goddess in her 
Wolf clan kilts. “I’ll bet you did, 
sweetie.” 

One of the other warriors en- 
tered from behind Vivian, looked 
at the dead Horse . woman and 
shuddered. “What a way to die, not 
even able to defend yourself.” She 
said to Vivian worriedly, “They’ve 
got an awful lot of equipment, 
chief.” 

Vivian said, “Well, what’re you 
worrying about, Jean? We have it 
now.” 

The girl said, “They have three 

95 



tommy guns, four automatic rifles, 
twenty grenades and forty sticks 
of dynamite.” 

Vivian was impatient. “They 
had them, now they’re ours. It’s 
good, not bad.” 

Jean said doggedly, “These raids 
are coming more and more often. 
We’ve lost ten fighters in less than 
a year. And each time they come at 
us they’re better equipped and 
there’re more of them.” She looked 
over at Alan. “If it hadn’t been 
for this . this queer way things 
worked out, they’d have our hus- 
band now and we’d be done for.” 

“Well, it didn’t happen that 
way,” Vivian said abruptly, “and 
we still have our husband and we’re 
going to keep him. This wasn’t a 
bad action at all. They killed three 
of us, we’ve got more than forty 
of them.” 

“Not three, eight,” Jean said. 
“You forget the five girls. In an- 
other couple of years they’d have 
been warriors. And besides, what 
difference does it make if we’ve got 
forty of them? There’re always 
more of them where they came 
from. There must be a thousand 
women toward Denver without a 
husband between them.” 

Vivian quieted. “Let’s hope they 
don’t all decide on Alan at once,” 
she said. “I wonder if the Turtles 
are having the same trouble.” 

“They’re having more,” Alan 
said. He had lowered himself 
wearily into one of the chairs. 

The two warriors looked at him. 
“How do you know, sweetie?” 
Vivian asked him. 

“I was talking to Warren, a few 
weeks ago. He’s husband of the 

96 


Turtle clan now, they traded him 
from the Foxes. Both clans were 
getting too interbred . .” 

“Get to the point, honey,” Jean 
said, embarrassed at this man talk. 

“The Turtles are having more 
trouble than we are. They have a 
stronger natural fortress at the cen- 
ter of their farm lands, but they’ve 
had so many raids that their arsenal 
is depleted and half their warriors 
dead or wounded. They’re getting 
desperate.” 

“That’s too bad,” Vivian mut- 
tered. “They make good neigh- 
bors.” 

Jean said, “The matriarch told 
me to let you know there’d be a 
meeting this afternoon in the as- 
sembly hall. Clan meeting, all pres- 
ent.” 

“What about?” Vivian said, her 
attention going back to the beauty 
of her captured weapon again. 

“About the prisoners. We’ve got 
to decide what to do with them.” 

“Do with them? We’ll push them 
over the side of the canyon. Nobody 
thought we’d waste bullets on them 
did they?” 

Alan said, mildly, “The question 
has come up whether we ought to 
destroy them at all.” 

Vivian looked at him in gentle 
annoyance. “Sweetie,” she said, 
“don’t bother your handsome head 
with these things. You’ve had 
enough excitement to last a nice 
looking fellow like you a lifetime.” 

Jean said, echoing her chief’s dis- 
gust, “Anyway, that’s what the 
meeting is about. Alan, here, has 
been talking to the matriarch and 
she’s agreed to bring it up for dis- 
cussion.” 


MACK REYNOLDS 



Vivian said nastily, “Sally is be- 
ginning to lose her grip. If there’s 
anything a clan needs it’s a strong 
matriarch.” 

“A wise matriarch,” Alan 
amended, knowing he shouldn’t. 

Vivian stared at him for a mo- 
ment, then threw her head back 
and laughed. “I’m going to have to 
spank your bottom one of these 
days,” she told him. “You get aw- 
fully sassy for a man.” 

A S CHAIRMAN, Alan had a 
voice but not a vote in the 
meetings of the Wolf clan. He 
sometimes wondered at the institu- 
tion which had come down from 
pre-bomb days. Why was it neces- 
sary to have a chairman. Of course, 
myth-legend had it that men were 
once just as numerous and active in 
society’s economic (and even mar- 
tial!) life as were women. But that 
was myth-legend. It all had a basis 
in reality, perhaps, but some of it 
was undoubtedly stretched all but 
to the breaking point. 

Of course if all men had been 
fertile in the old days. But if you 
started with if, as a beginning point, 
you could go as far as you wished 
in any direction. 

He called the meeting to order 
in the assembly hall which stood 
possibly a hundred feet below the 
citadel in one direction, another 
hundred from the stone corral 
which housed their prisoners, in the 
other. The Wolf clan was present 
in its entirety with the exception of 
children under ten and except for 
four scouts who were holding the 
prisoners. As chairman, Alan sat 

AFTER SOME TOMORROW 


on the dais flanked by Sally, the 
matriarch, 35 years of age, tall, 
Junoesque, on one side and by 
Vivian the scout chief, on the 
other. 

Before them sat, first, the active 
warrior-workers, some thirty-five of 
them. Second, the older women, less 
than a score. Further back were the 
sterilies, possibly twenty of these 
and quite young, only within recent 
memory had they been allowed to 
become part of the clan, in the past 
they had been driven away or 
killed. Further back still were the 
children above ten but too young 
to join the ranks of either warrior- 
workers or sterilies. 

Alan called the meeting to order, 
quieted them somewhat and then 
invited the matriarch to take the 
floor. 

Sally stood and looked out over 
her clan, the dignity of her pres- 
ence silencing them where Alan’s 
plea had not. 

She said, “We have two matters 
to bring to our attention. First, I 
believe the clan should make it 
clear to Alan, our husband, that 
such interference in the affairs of 
women is utterly out of the ques- 
tion. I am speaking of his unmanly 
activities in the raid this morning.” 

There were mumblings of ap- 
proval throughout the hall. 

Alan came to his feet, his face 
bewildered. “But, Sally, what else 
could I do? If I hadn’t overcome 
the enemy warriors and turned the 
Bren gun on the others you would 
all be gone now. Possibly none of 
you would have survived.” 

Sally quieted him with a chill 
look. “Let me repeat what is well 

97 



known to every member of the 
clan. We consist of less than sixty 
women, a few more than thirty-five 
of whom are active. There are 
twenty sterilies and twenty-five or 
so children. And one husband. A 
few more than one hundred in all.” 

Her voice slowed and lowered 
for the sake of emphasis. “All of 
our women — except for two or 
three — might die and the clan 
would live on. The sterilies certain- 
ly might all die, and the clan live 
on. Even the children could all die 
and the clan live on. But if our hus- 
band dies, the clan dies . The great- 
est responsibility of every member 
of any clan is to protect the hus- 
band. Under no circumstances is he 
to be endangered. You know this, 
it should not have to be brought to 
your attention.” 

There was a strong murmur of 
assent from those seated before 
them. 

Alan said, “But, Sally, I saved 
your lives! And if I hadn’t, I would 
have been captured by the Crows 
and Horses and you would have lost 
me at any rate.” 

This was hard for Sally Wolf, but 
she said, “Then, at least, they 
would have had you. If you had 
died, in your foolhardiness, you 
would have been gone for all of us. 
Alan, two clans, husbandless clans, 
united in this attempt to capture 
you from us. While we fought to 
protect our husband, the life of our 
clan, we hold no rancor against 
them. In their position, we would 
have done the same. Much rather 
would we see you taken by them, 
than to see you dead. Even though 
the Wolf clan might die, the race 

98 


must go on.” She added, but not 
very believably, “If they had cap- 
tured you, perhaps we could have, 
in our turn, captured a husband 
from some other clan.” 

“The reason we probably 
couldn’t,” Vivian said mildly, “is 
that since we’ve turned to agricul- 
ture and settled, our numbers have 
dropped off by half. We had more 
than sixty warriors while we were 
hunter-foragers.” 

“That’s enough, Vivian,” Sally 
snapped. “The question isn’t being 
discussed this afternoon.” 

“Ought to be,” somebody whis- 
pered down in front. 

“Order,” Alan said. He knew it 
was a growing belief in the clan 
that giving up the nomadic life had 
been a mistake. From raiders, they 
had become the raided. 

Sally said, “The second order of 
business is the disposal of the Horse 
and Crow prisoners captured in the 
action today.” 

Vivian said, “We can’t afford to 
waste valuable ammunition. I say 
shove them into the canyon. 

Most of those seated in the hall 
approved of that. Some were puz- 
zled of face, wondering why the 
matter hadn’t been left simply in 
the scout chief’s hands. 

Sally said, dryly, “I haven’t 
formed an opinion myself. How- 
ever, our chairman has some words 
to say.” 

Vivian looked at Alan as though 
he was a precocious child. She 
shook her head. “You cutie, you. 
You’re getting bigger and bigger 
for your britches every day.” 

Two or three of the warriors 
echoed her by chuckling fondly. 

MACK REYNOLDS 



Alan said nothing to that, need- 
ing to maintain what dignity and 
prestige he could muster. 

He stood and faced them and 
waited for their silence before say- 
ing, “You feminine members of the 
clan are too busy with work and 
with defense to pursue some of the 
studies for which we men find 
time.” 

Vivian murmured, “You ain’t 
just a whistlin’, honey. But we 
don’t mind. You do what you want 
with your time, honey.” 

He tried to smile politely, but 
went on. “It has come to the point 
where few women read to any ex- 
tent and most learning has fallen 
into the hands of the men — few as 
we are.” 

Sally said impatiently, “What has 
this got to do with the prisoners, 
Alan dear?” 

It would seem that he had ig- 
nored her when he said, “I have 
been discussing the matter with 
Warren of the Turtle clan and two 
or three other men with whom I 
occasionally come in contact. At 
the rate the race is going, there will 
be no men left at all in another few 
generations.” 

There was quiet in the long hall. 
Deathly quiet. 

Sally said, “How . how do you 
mean, dear?” 


“I mean our present system can’t 
go on. It isn’t working.” 

“Of course it’s working,” Vivian 
snapped. “Here we are aren’t we? 
It’s always worked, it always will. 
Here’s the clan. You’re our hus-\ 
band. After we’ve had you for 
twenty years, we’ll trade you to an- 
other clan for their husband — pre- 
vents interbreeding. If you have a 
fertile son, the clan will either split, 
each half taking one husband, or 
we’ll trade him off for land, or 
guns, or whatever else is valuable. 
Of course, it works.” 

He shook his head, stubbornly. 
“Things are changing. For a gen- 
eration or two after bomb day, we 
were in chaos. By time things 
cleared we were divided as we are 
now, in clans. However, we were 
still largely able to exist on the 
canned goods, the animals, left over 
from the old days. There was food 
and guns for all and only a few of 
the men were sterilies.” 

Vivian began to say something 
again, but he shook a hand nega- 
tively at her, pleading for silence. 
“No, I’m not talking about myth- 
legend now. Warren’s great-grand- 
father, whom he knew as a boy, re- 
members when there were four 
times or more the number of men 
we have today and when the 
sterilies were very few.”

Vivian said impatiently, “What’s 
this got to do with the prisoners? 
There they are. We can kill them 
or let them go. If we let them go, 
they’ll be coming back, six months 
from now, to take another crack at 
us. Alan is cute as a button, but I 
don’t think he should meddle in 
women’s affairs.” 

But most of them were silent. 
They looked up at him, waiting for 
him to go on. 

“I suppose,” Sally said, “that 
you’re coming to a point, dear?” 
He nodded, his face tight. “I’m 
coming to the point. The point is 
that we’ve got to change the basis 
of clan society. This isn’t working 
any more — if it ever did. There’s 
such a thing as planned breeding 
. it had been hard to say this, 
and the younger women in the 
audience, in particular, tittered 
. and we’re going to have to 
think in terms of it.” 

Sally had flushed. She said now, 
“A certain dignity is expected at a 
clan meeting, Alan dear. But just 
what did you mean?” 

Vivian said, “This is nonsense, 
I’m leaving,” and she was up from 
the speaker’s table and away. Two 
or three of her younger girls looked 
after, scowling, but they didn’t fol- 
low her out of the hall. 

“I mean,” Alan said doggedly, 
“that one of those Crow women has 
been the mother of two fertile men. 
To my knowledge she is the only 
woman within hundreds of miles 
this can be said about. We men 
have been keeping records of such 
things.” 

Sally was as mystified as the rest 
of the clan. 

100 


* 

Alan said, “I say bring these 
women into the clan. Unite with 
the Turtles and the Burros so that 
we’ll have three clans, five counting 
the Horses and Crows. Then we’ll 
have enough strength to fight off 
the forager-hunters, and we’ll have 
enough men to experiment in selec- 
tive breeding.” 

Half of the hall was on its feet in 
a roar. 

“Share you with these . • these 
desert rats who just raided us, who 
killed eight of our clan?” Sally 
snapped, flabbergasted. 

He stood his ground. “Yes. I’ll 
repeat, one of those Crow women 
has bonie two fertile men children. 
We can’t afford to kill her. For all 
we know, she might have a dozen 
more. This haphazard method of a 
single husband for a whole clan 
must be replaced . .” 

The hall broke down into chaos 
again. 

Sally held up a commanding 
hand for silence. She said, “And if 
we share you with another forty or 
fifty women, to what extent will the 
rest of us have any husband at all?” 

He pointed out the sterilies, 
seated silently in the back. “It 
would be healthier if you gave up 
some of this superior contempt you 
hold for sterile males and accept 
their companionship. Although 
they cannot be fathers, they can be 
mates otherwise. As it is, how much 
true companionship do you secure 
from me — any of you? Less than 
once a month do you see me more 
than from a distance.” 

“Mate with sterilies?” someone 
gasped from the front row. 

“Yes,” Alan snapped back. “And 

MACK REYNOLDS 



let fertile men be used expressly 
for attempting to produce addi- 
tional fertile men. Confound it, 
can’t you warriors realize what I’m 
saying? I have reports that there is 
a woman among the Crows who 
has borne two fertile male children. 
Have you ever heard of any such 
phenomenon before? Do you realize 
that in the fifteen years I have been 
the husband of this clan, we have 
not had even one fertile man child 
bom? Do you realize that in the 
past twenty years there has been 
bom not one fertile man child in 
the Turtle clan? Only one in the 
Burro clan?” 

He had them in the palm of his 
hand now. 

“What — what does the Turtle 
clan think of this plan of yours?” 
Sally said. 

“I was talking to Warren just the 
other day. He thinks he can win 
their approval. We can also prob- 
ably talk the Burros into it. They’re 
growing desperate. Their husband 
is nearly sixty years old and has 
produced only one fertile male 
child, which was later captured in 
a raid by the Denver foragers.” 

Sally said, “And we’d have to 


share you with all these, and with 
our prisoners as well?” 

“Yes, in an attempt to breed fer- 
tile men back into the race.” 

Sally turned to the assembled 

clan. 

A heavy explosion, room-shaking 
in its violence, all but threw them 
to the floor. Half a dozen of the 
younger warriors scurried to the 
windows, guns at the ready. 

In the distance, from the outside, 
there was the chatter of a machine 
gun, then individual pistol shots. 

“The corral,” Jean the scout 
said, her lips going back over her 
teeth. 

Vivian came sauntering back into 
the assembly hall, patting the stock 
of her new tommy gun appreciate- 
ly. “Works like a charm,” she said. 
“That dynamite we captured was 
fresh too. Blew ’em to smithereens. 
Only had to finish off half a dozen.” 
Alan said, agonizingly, “Vivian! 
You didn’t . the prisoners?” 

She grinned at him. “Alan, you’re 
as cute as a button, but you don’t 
know anything about women’s af- 
fairs. Now you be a honey and go 
back to taking care of the children.”

NIGHT COURT 


PffilUllllllUIIIHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIIUIIIliUlUlllllllllUIIIIIIIIIIIIIUIIIH 


With a new cast nightly, it was the best 
show in town. Gay crowds mobbed the box 
office for tickets; but few went back more 
than twice . 


BY NORMAN ARKAWY 


T HE OLD courthouse was in the 
unreconstructed part of town. 
No buses ran out here, and the 
only way that Stan and Julie could 
reach the court was on foot, thread- 
ing their way through the debris of 
neglect and vandalism that littered 
the narrow streets. 

This was a part of New York 


that Julie had never seen. Twen- 
tieth century tenements, dimly il- 
luminated by ancient incandescent 
lamps, lined the rubble-filled 
streets, where garbage and the de^ 
caying carcasses of poisoned rats 
lay stinking in the gutters. The 
night was warm, but Julie shivered. 
She hurried along at Stan’s side, 


102

trying to hold her breath to shut 
out the unpleasant smells. 

They stopped at the edge of the 
sidewalk across the street from the 
court and watched a crowd of peo- 
ple milling about the entrance, 
anxiously pressing to the box office 
to try to get hard-to-get tickets. 

“Look at that mob!” Julie said. 


“We’ll never get in!” She tried to 
sound disappointed, but she knew 
that she could not hide her feeling 
of relief. She didn’t want to go in. 
She wanted to go away, back to the 
clean, pretty city she knew. 

Stan smiled and patted her hand. 
“You underestimate me, honey. 
Little Stanley knows how to take 


103 


care of himself. I knew there’d be a 
crowd tonight, so . .” He drew 
two tickets from his pocket. “If you 
don’t reserve ’em, you don’t de- 
serve ’em, I always say!” 

He took her hand, and they 
started across the street toward the 
courthouse. It was a bleak, gray, 
Stone-faced building whose ornate 
sculptured trim was weather worn 
and darkened with age. Once an 
aspiration to architectural beauty, 
it was pathetically ugly, a melan- 
choly reminder of a bygone and 
possibly better era. 

A modem theater marquee had 
been incongruously added to the 
old structure and, atop the shiny 
new addition, huge letters of light 
spelled out NIGHT COURT. 
Smaller cast aluminum letters pro- 
truded upward from the metal rim 
of the arcing canopy and formed 
the words of a motto: “Judge not, 
that ye be not judged”. Bold type 
plastered across the gleaming glass 
facade of the marquee loudly pro- 
claimed: “NEW SHOW NIGHT- 
LY”. 

Stan and Julie pushed through 
the congestion outside the entrance 
of the court. A dizzying confusion 
Of elbows and backs and sweating, 
eager faces surrounded them. Stan 
squeezed through the seething mass 
of people and, holding tightly to 
his hand, Julie followed. For the 
tenth — or hundredth — time, she 
was sorry that she had come. But it 
was too late to turn back now. 

Stan showed his tickets to the 
guard at the door, and they were 
ushered politely inside where a uni- 
formed woman with a military bear- 
ing guided them to their seats. 

104 


“Your ID cards, please,” the 
young woman said. 

Julie was startled by the request, 
and alarmed. A confiscated ID card 
meant trouble — police trouble ! 

“Why?” she asked, nervously, 
“What did we do?” 

Stan smiled knowingly. “It’s just 
a formality,” he assured her. “They 
give it back to you when you leave.” 
He handed the usher his card. 
“And yours, miss?” 

Hesitantly, Julie took out her 
wallet. A cold premonition urged 
her to stop, to leave now, before it 
was too late. Then she saw Stan’s 
amused eyes grinning at her and 
she reminded herself that it was al- 
ready too late for her to leave. She 
gave the girl her ID card. 

The usher smiled mechanically. 
She handed them each a program 
and hurried away up the aisle. 

“Don’t worry, honey,” Stan said, 
“you’ll get it back.” He held his 
program up for her to admire. 
‘ Pretty snazzy, huh?” 

Julie nodded half-heartedly and 
silently leafed through her own pro- 
gram. It was a four page souvenir 
booklet. On the first page, or front 
cover, was the seal of justice with a 
perfectly balanced scale and a few 
words of Latin. Above the seal, 
NIGHT COURT OF THE CITY 
OF NEW YORK was embossed in 
black on the slick yellow paper, and 
below it, the legend “Judge not, 
that ye be not judged”. Beneath 
the seal, in red italics, was the in- 
scription: “For with what judg- 
ment ye judge 3 ye shall be judged: 
and with what measure ye mete , it 
shall be measured to you again . — 
Matthew, 7:2.” 


NORMAN ARKAWY 



The page was set up attractively 
but, Julie thought, the quotations 
seemed inappropriate. What was 
the purpose of the court, if not to 
judge? 

“I still can’t figure it out,” Stan 
said, as if he had read her thoughts. 
He reached over and tapped Julie’s 
program with his finger. “This is 
the third time I’ve been here, and 
you can believe me, honey, they 
both judge and mete out justice in 
this place!” He grinned at her. 
“This ‘judge not’ business doesn’t 
make sense!” 

Julie said nothing. There was 
nothing to say. 

The room was rapidly filling up 
now, and she watched the people 
slowly filing in. She was fascinated 
by the looks of anticipatory pleas- 
ure in their faces, the whole place 
tingled with barely repressed excite- 
ment. 

The spectators packed into the 
room until every seat was taken 
and they were standing, eight deep, 
in the rear of the court. Scanning 
their faces, Julie could feel — could 
almost taste — the many varied 
emotions that radiated from them: 
amusement, lust, hatred, curiosity, 
vengeance. It was a puzzling com- 
bination. 

“Now, this quotation makes some 
sense,” Stan was saying. Julie 
turned her attention back to him. 
He had opened his program booklet 
to the centerfold, and he pointed 
to an inscription printed across the 
top of the two inner pages. “An eye 
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,” he 
recited. “That’s what this place 
really stands for!” He said it with 
relish. 


Julie began to feel sick. She did 
not like the hungry look on Stan’s 
face or the merciless atmosphere 
in the courtroom. Why had she 
come? 

She stifled a shudder. She knew 
why she had come. She had come 
because Stan wanted her to and, 
to be honest, because she had been 
curious to see what the Show was 
like. Now that she was here, she 
could not call the whole thing off 
just because her curiosity was satis- 
fied or because she was too squeam- 
ish to enjoy what many people con- 
sidered the best entertainment in 
town. She had no right to ruin 
Stan’s evening. 

She tried to assume a casual in- 
terest in the impending events. 
“What are all these lines for?” she 
asked weakly, indicating the hori- 
zontal lines that crossed the inner 
pages and were bisected by three 
vertical lines into four columns of 
uneven width. “It looks like a 
ledger.” 

“It is, sort of,” Stan said. “Y’see, 
honey, this is a scorecard. In the 
first column, you put the name of 
the accused; in the second, the of- 
fense he’s charged with; in the 
third, his plea; and in the fourth, 
the disposition of the case. Up 
here,” he explained, showing her 
the appropriate place, “you fill in 
the name of the presiding magis- 
trate. And here,” he continued, 
“you put in the date. It makes a 
nice souvenir. If you fill it out right, 
you can look at it six months from 
now and remember all the fun, just 
as if it were happening all over 
again.” 

“Fun?” Julie’s voice cracked. 


NIGHT COURT 


105 



“Sure!” Stan said with enthusi- 
asm. “It’s a terrific show! Everyone 
has a good time. Well, anyhow . 
and he chuckled, “everyone but the 
bums!” He laughed. 

A man in the row in front of 
them turned around and looked at 
Julie. Perspiration glistened in an 
oily film on his round, pudgy 
moon-face. A lewd grin twisted his 
mouth. “First timer?” he asked. 

Stan grinned back at him, shar- 
ing a comradeship of common ex- 
perience. “Yeah. I kept telling her 
she didn’t know what she was miss- 
ing. Finally convinced her to give it 
a try. I’ve been here twice before, 
myself,” he added proudly. 

“Yeah? Me too!” the man said. 
“Guess that makes us real old pros: 
third timers!” He laughed and 
mopped his face with a crumpled 
handkerchief. “Damn! it’s hot in 
here!” 

Mild embarrassment and a vio- 
lent dislike for the oily-skinned man 
combined to redden Julie’s face in 
a hot blush. She shifted uncomfort- 
ably in her seat. 

“Y’know, I never thought of it 
before,” Stan said to the man in 
front, “but now that you mention 
it, I don’t know of anybody who’s 
been here three times.” A smile of 
accomplishment spread onto his 
face. “I’ll bet I’m the first one in 
my sector!” 

A growing anger blended into 
Julie’s feeling of disgust. “I don’t 
see that it’s anything to be proud 
of,” she said coldly. 

Stan’s laugh was a derisive bray. 
“She talks just like a first timer, 
doesn’t she?” The man in front of 
them nodded knowingly, again 

106 


sharing with Stan the common 
bond of experience. 

“The next thing you know,” Stan 
jeered kiddingly, “she’ll be preach- 
ing to us like one of those crack- 
pot reformers.” 

The revulsion that Julie felt must 
have been clearly evident now. 
Stan smiled fondly and put his arm 
around her shoulder. “I’m only 
kidding, honey,” he half-apolo- 
gized. 

“What’s so wrong about the re- 
formers?” Julie demanded, angrily 
shrugging away his arm. “Why 
shouldn’t men be given another 
chance? What . ?” 

“Men?” The man with the moon 
face burst into loud laughter. 
“Wait’ll you see these bums, kid! 
They’re not men, they’re things l” 
“He’s right, honey,” Stan said. 
“These joes don’t have any homes 
or jobs or families or friends. They 
don’t even have ID cards.” 

“No ID cards?” That was im- 
possible! But Julie was beginning 
to learn that many impossible 
things could happen in a world 
that most citizens knew nothing 
about. “Then how can they be ex- 
pected to get jobs? You’ve got to 
have an ID card in order to be as- 
signed . .” 

“That’s the general idea, lady,” 
someone nearby said in a loud 
voice. Several people laughed. 
“You don’t wanna put the court 
out of business, do ya?” 

Julie’s lips trembled as she 
opened her mouth to voice the 
word that shouted emphatically 
within her: yes! yes! 

“Here they come!” someone 
shouted, and excited conversation 

NORMAN ARKAWY 



buzzed throughout the room. Julie’s 
voice was never heard. She stared 
silently at the people near her, then 
turned to the front of the room to 
see what they were all watching so 
avidly. 

A straggling line of bedraggled, 
dirty, unshaven men shuffled into a 
wire enclosure set along the right 
wall of the courtroom. Crushed 
men — weary, lifeless, resigned to a 
life without hope — they filed into 
the pen and slumped onto the 
wooden benches that were placed 
lengthwise in three rows in the ob- 
long cage. Their shoulders drooped 
in beaten curves. Their heads were 
bowed. 

The man in front turned around 
and nudged Julie’s knee. His tri- 
umphant smile was an obscenity. 
“Call those men?” He laughed and 
winked at Stan, then turned back 
to the front of the court to watch 
the preliminary proceedings. 

An incipient convulsion crawled 
about in Julie’s stomach. Her knee 
felt cold and clammy where the 
moon-faced man had touched it. 
Her skin was prickly and tight. She 
began to itch. 

“Get up, honey,” Stan was say- 
ing. “Here comes the judge.” 

She stood, numbly, her eyes 
riveted on the men in the wire en- 
closure. 

“Julie!” She felt a hand tugging 
at her arm. “You can sit down now, 
Julie,” Stan said. “Sit down!” 

Mechanically, she sat down. 
Woodenly, she stared at the tableau 
before her — the judge perched on 
his elevated throne, the stone-faced 
attendants at each side of the dais, 
the wire pen filled with misery. 

NIGHT COURT 


Through the almost tangible excite- 
ment and glee of the spectators, the 
misery reached her, held her. 

T HE COURT was in session: 
the people of the City of New 
York against . against an assort- 
ment of outcasts — drunks, derelicts, 
cripples, beggars — the “undesir- 
ables” that had been rounded up 
by the police in the past twenty- 
four hours. The people of the City 
of New York against a pen full of 
men whose only crimes, for the 
most part, were sickness, lack of 
hope and failure to possess the ID 
cards which everyone needed and 
which, somehow, they had been 
denied. 

How? Julie wondered. How 
could anyone not have an ID? 
Even if you lost your card you 
could get a new one simply by pay- 
ing a fine. Even if you had been in 
prison you got a new card when 
you were released. You had to have 
a card! Everyone had to . 

A court attendant called out: 
“Garcia, Miguel!” and a small, 
dark-complexioned man walked 
out of the detention pen and stood 
meekly before the judge. 

The clerk of the court read the 
charge, rattling it off in the sing- 
song jargon of court clerks, his 
words slurred together into one al- 
most unintelligible burst of sound. 
There was a pause, and silence in 
the courtroom. 

“Well?” said the magistrate, 
“how do you plead?” His voice 
sounded kindly. He sat high on his 
bench, hunched into his black robe, 
and looked down with apparent be- 

107 



nignancy on the little man who 
stood silently before him. 

The audience was hushed. It 
watched hopefully and waited. 

Julie could sense the intense ex- 
citement in Stan as he leaned for- 
ward, straining to catch every de- 
tail of the scene, anxious not to 
miss a thing. 

She heard a giggle, then Stan’s 
hearty laugh, then a loud burst 
of laughter. She opened her eyes. 

The defendant was shrugging his 
shoulders in bewilderment. He 
turned half-way around to look at 
the laughing audience, a sheepish 
grin on his face. 

The magistrate smiled his ap- 
preciation of the humorous response 
to his question. “So, you can’t 
make up your mind?” he said in a 
seemingly friendly and sympathetic 
way. “Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll 
do, Miguel. I’ll give you thirty days 
in the city’s hotel to think it over.” 

Laughter and applause filled the 
room. The judge nodded his head 
in a little bow of acknowledgement. 
Miguel Garcia was led away, still 
smiling, obviously ignorant of what 
was happening. Miguel Garcia ap- 
parently did not understand Eng- 
lish. 

Stan was happily filling in the 
first line of his scorecard. His face 
was flushed. His eyes were bright. 
A satisfied smile lingered on his 
lips. 

“Stan, let’s leave,” Julie said. 

Stan laughed in disbelief. “Are 
you kidding? The fun’s just start- 
mg. 

“Please, Stan. I ... I don’t feel 
well.” 

“Oh? I’m sorry, honey.” It was 

108 . 


a formality, like saying T beg your 
pardon’ to a stranger you bump 
into in a crowd. There was no con- 
cern in Stan’s voice. The second 
case was being presented, and his 
attention was rapt upon the clerk 
and the object of the proceedings, 
an old white haired derelict. 

“Stan, please!” Julie insisted. 

“Look, honey,” Stan said im- 
patiently, “we can’t leave now, even 
if we wanted to. They don’t give 
back the IDs until after it’s all 
over.” 

A sharp burst of laughter brought 
his attention abruptly back to the 
action up front. The old man had 
dropped his hat and an attendant 
had kicked it away from him. The 
white haired castoff shuffled across 
the room to retrieve it. 

“I missed something!” Stan said, 
testily. He turned to his neighbor 
and was hurriedly filled in on what 
had happened. 

“Well, Vm leaving!” Julie said. 
She got up and edged her way out 
to the aisle. Stan made no protest. 
He was concentrating on the per- 
formance up front. 

Julie hurried up the aisle and 
pushed through the pack of people 
standing in the back of the room. 
She found the usher at the door. 
“I’d like to leave,” she told the girl. 
“May I please have my ID?” 

The usher’s face was expression- 
less, her voice efficiently official. 
“ID cards will be returned at the 
conclusion of the session.” 

“But I want to leave now!” Julie 
protested. “I don’t want to see 
any more of this!” 

“No cards can be returned until 
the session is concluded,” the usher 

NORMAN ARKAWY 



recited. It was a final decree of 
official policy. There could be no 
arguing, no appeal from the 
decision. There was no alternative 
but to abide by it. 

Julie returned to her seat. She 
squeezed past a barricade of knees, 
rousing disgruntled comments from 
several of the spectators. 

Stan glanced up at her as she 
settled back into the seat at his side. 
It was only a glance, and then his 
eyes were fixed once again on the 
magistrate, the attendants, and the 
“undesirable” being judged. 

Minutes passed. Hours. Julie 
suffered the time in silence. She 
saw and heard, but could hardly 
believe, the unrestrained sadism 
of the giggling, laughing, applaud- 
ing, cheering, jeering audience. 
What kind of people were these, 
who laughed at the pain and hu- 
miliation of others? What did they 
find amusing in the ruin of human 
life? 

They laughed when a partially 
paralyzed hunchback limped be- 
fore the judge and pleaded guilty 
to a charge of ogling girls in a 
public park. They roared with hi- 
larity when the magistrate sus- 
pended sentence and commented 
that a more appropriate charge 
would have been that of defacing 
public property. They applauded 
lustily when he said to the arrest- 
ing officer, “Bring him in on that 
one tomorrow and I’ll throw the 
book at him!” 

They laughed when an alcoholic 
appeared, twitching and brushing 
imaginary creatures from his tom 
jacket. They howled gleefully when 

NIGHT COURT 


he whimpered and sobbed like a 
small boy having a nightmare. 

They laughed when the magis- 
trate said his fountain pen had run 
out of ink and, looking into the de- 
tention pen, inquired, “Would any 
of you blue bloods care to make a 
donation?” 

They laughed when a court at- 
tendant read a complaint which 
charged that the defendant, a small 
skinny man, had attacked the ar- 
resting officer, and that the officer 
( six-three, two hundred and ten 
pounds) had used reasonable force 
in defending himself. The man’s 
broken arm was in a sling and 
bandages covered twelve stitches 
in his scalp. 

The audience laughed. They 
gloated. They sat in judgment of 
their fellow men and called for 
punishment — the more severe, the 
better. 

At last, the detention pen was 
empty. The last “undesirable” was 
brought before the bench. He was a 
small, pathetic looking man dressed 
in sailor’s dungarees. He spoke 
Norwegian and clumsily tried to ex- 
plain his predicament with the few 
words of English that he knew. 

“Stop gibbering!” the judge 
shouted at him. The magistrate’s 
facade of kindliness had long since 
disappeared. He turned to the ar- 
resting officer. “Do you speak that 
language?” He made it sound like 
a disgrace to be able to speak Nor- 
wegian. 

The officer shook his head. 

“Neither do I,” the magistrate 
said, with obvious pride that he 
was not contaminated by such 
knowledge. He arbitrarily ordered 

109 



the man held until he learned to 
make himself understood; the hear- 
ing to take place when that had 
been accomplished. The sailor was 
led away. 

The Show was over. 

“That’s the end of it, folks,” the 
judge said, genially. He tapped his 
gavel and rose from his seat. The 
courtroom rang with lusty applause. 

The judge hurried through the 
door to his chambers and the 
applause died out. The people 
started to leave. Their animated 
discussions of the evening’s events 
dinned through the room in a 
babble of noise. 


J ULIE’S head throbbed painfully 
and there was a queasy feeling 
in her stomach. She thirsted for 
fresh air. 

Slowly, the mob of spectators 
formed a procession in the aisle. 
Slowly, the column of people moved 
toward the exit. Slowly, slowly, 
Julie was pushed along with the 
crowd. 

The line paused as each person 
stopped at the door and waited 
until his ID card was located and 
returned to him. Then the pro- 
cession would take another step 
forward. And pause again. And 
again. Occasionally, an ID could 
not be found and its owner was 
requested to step aside and allow 
the line to move on while the search 
for his card continued. And there 
was another step forward. 

Stan held Julie’s hand to prevent 
the pressing crowd from separating 
them. “How’d you like it?” he 
asked. He was aglow with satisfac- 

110 


tion, tired by the long evening’s 
excitement but with a pleasant 
weariness of accomplishment. “It’s 
a terrific show, isn’t it?” 

Julie did not answer him. She 
wanted to break away and run and 
run and run and run! She inched 
along with the rest of the proces- 
sion. 

At last they reached the door. 
They told the usher their names 
and she methodically checked 
through the cards in her file. The 
procession behind them waited. 

Julie’s ID card was quickly found 
and returned to her, but the usher 
reported some difficulty in finding 
Stan’s card. He was asked to step 
aside, please, and let the line go 
through. He protested at the in- 
convenience, then sullenly joined 
a few other people waiting for their 
cards in the rear of the court. 

Julie stood impatiently in the 
doorway. She watched Stan strike 
up a grumbling conversation with 
another detained person. It was 
the moon-faced man who had been 
sitting in front of them. For a fleet- 
ing moment she thought of the old 
adage about “birds of a feather”. 

She waited. People filed past her 
in a steady stream, from the court- 
room, across the lobby, out through 
the street door. Watching them — 
smiles and pleasant conversation, 
civilized small talk and serious de- 
bate of the merit of the evening’s 
fare, as if it were a dramatic work 
of art. She clenched her teeth and 
prayed that Stan would hurry up. 

Soon the flow of people stopped. 
Still no Stan. Julie waited. 

Some twenty minutes later, an 
attendant came out of the court- 


NORMAN ARKAWY 



room. He went past Julie, then 
paused at the door, turned and 
came over to her. “Waiting for 
someone, miss?” 

“Yes. My friend. They seem to 
have misplaced his ID card.” 

The attendant smiled and shook 
his head. “You might as well go on 
home, miss. If he’s still in there, he 
won’t be coming out for some 
time.” 

“I’ll wait,” Julie said. 

“You don’t understand, miss. He 
won’t be out tonight.” 

“What are you talking about? 
He’s just waiting till they find his 
ID, and it couldn’t have gotten up 
and . 

“Seventeen IDs were lost,” the 
attendant explained, “Those people 
in there can’t get them back. 
They’re going to have to go to 
Caracas or Milan to apply for new 
cards.” 

“Don’t be silly!” Julie scoffed, 
“You don’t have to go to another 
city to apply for a new card! All 
you have to do is file a claim and 
pay the fine.” 

“These are special cases,” the 
attendant said uneasily. He seemed 
reluctant to talk about it. 

Julie frowned. “What’s special 
about them? Their ID cards were 
lost, weren’t they?” 

“Look, miss, all I know is every 
time an ID is lost in there,” he 
nodded toward the courtroom, 
“they’ve gotta go out of the country 
to apply for a new one. That’s all 
I can tell you.” 

“But why out of the . .?” 

“The reassignment orders are 
being drawn up right now,” the 
attendant said. He led Julie to the 

NIGHT COURT 


street exit. “So you’d better go 
home and forget that fellow.” 
Confusion and a vicarious fear 
made Julie shiver. “Will he . will 
they get new cards?” 

The attendant shrugged. “They 
might — some day.” He touched her 
arm. His voice was low, barely 
audible. “Was this your first time 
at the Show?” 

Julie nodded. 

“How did you like it?” 

“I . I . .” She shook her 
head. 

The attendant smiled at her 
gently. “Don’t ever be a third- 
timer.” He released her arm and 
hurried away down the street. 

Julie puzzled over his parting re- 
mark as she went out into the foul 
smelling night and walked away 
from the courthouse. Suddenly, the 
street before her dimmed as the 
lights on the huge marquee blinked 
out. She turned and looked back at 
the entrance of the court, now dark 
and deserted. And then she under- 
stood. 

She remembered the moon-faced 
man’s observation about the scarcity 
of third-timers. She understood 
how the “undesirables” lost their 
ID cards and why so many could 
not speak English. She understood 
the apparent cruelty of the sen- 
tences meted out to them, too. 

The answer was on the marquee. 
As she looked back at it, only the 
raised letters on the canopy were 
visible, shining luminously in the 
darkness: “judge not, that ye be 
not judged And she recalled the 
quotation on the program: “For 
with what judgement ye judge , ye 
shall be judged * • • •

SCIENCE 




at the rate of a million calories per 
minute. Architects of tomorrow 
who will be thinking less in terms 
of insulation to keep out the sun’s 
heat and more in terms of using the 
roof as part of the heating system 
will be making this new unit a 
common household term to replace 
‘‘gallons” of oil and “tons” of coal. 


Hope of making milk a disease- 
germ-fighting substance — so that 
all who drink it would have im- 
munity to a host of ailments — is 
held out for the future by research- 
ers at the University of Minnesota. 
The method would be to inject 
vaccines for disease-causing bac- 
teria and viruses into the cow’s 
udders. In response to this kind of 
vaccination, cows produce large 
quantities of antibodies. This would 
give milk drinkers passive immu- 
nity, which is not as long lasting 
as the kind one gets from an at- 
tack of a disease or a vaccination. 
However, by continuing to drink 
the milk die passive immunity 
could be continued. 

Science minded folks of the future 
may soon be adding two new 
words to their vocabulary of meas- 
urements. Timekeeping with atomic 
clocks has produced the word 
“essen” to designate a second as 
measured by atomic vibrations, to 
distinguish it from the word used 
to designate astronomical seconds. 
“Roof” is a new unit described as 
the quantity of energy that would 
fall on the actual roof area of a 
small house about 33 feet square 
during a day when the sun shines 


The marriage of the engine of the 
future with the fuel of the future 
was described recently at the first 
unclassified public discussion of 
nuclear gas turbines. Such nuclear 
gas turbine plants will have their 
greatest application in ships and in 
areas where other power plants 
cannot be used. With a gas turbine 
as the ideal power take-off for the 
nuclear reactor, they could be used 
in remote areas where power is 
now unavailable, where storage of 
conventional fuels is a problem, 
and during wartime where both 
storage and refueling for long life- 
lines are important. The gas turbine 
power plant takes up less space 
and operates at a higher efficiency 
than do power plants run on wa- 
ter or fossil fuels. Perhaps their 
greatest advantage over existing 
power plants is the fact that they 
can be transported from one place 
to another. Although there are still 
refinements to be made, nuclear 
gas turbine plants are a fact, and 
will come into use in the not too 
distant future. 

Housewives may have to go to the 
frozen food counter for a loaf of 
bread in tomorrow’s supermarket. 
Bakers are looking hopefully to- 
ward the commercial freezing of 


113 



bread, a practice that promises to 
reduce staling, loss of unsold loaves 
and costly night baking. Experts 
have probed into the technical 
problems, and learned that the 
maximum storage temperature for 
top quality bread is 10 degrees 
Fahrenheit for periods of about a 
week. Zero degrees is needed for 
extended storage. Moisture distri- 
bution, firmness, and taste are es- 
sentially the same as in freshly 
baked bread and will remain that 
way for four to seven weeks at zero 
degrees Fahrenheit 

Aircraft of the future may have to 
be designed to last for only a few 
hours, and then be scrapped. The 
problems created by the thermal 
barrier are triggering this new de- 
sign philosophy. The two problems 
that must be mastered before 
Man’s missiles can break through 
the earth’s atmosphere at super- 
sonic speed are: heat and creep 
(the softening of materials under 
increased stress). At five times the 
speed of sound at sea level tem- 
peratures are sufficient to melt the 
best aluminum alloys known. This, 
coupled with a weight penalty due 
to weakening of materials brought 
on by aerodynamic heating, may 
limit sustained flight to a region 
below three and a half times the 
speed of sound. 

A national astronomical observa- 
tory, long the dream of astrono- 
mers, will become an accomplished 
fact in about five years. The first 
of its kind in the United States, the 
observatory will probably be run 
jointly by several institutions. It 


will give astronomers from all over 
the country much better research 
facilities than their institutions can 
separately afford. A grant of 
$279, (XX) has been made to the 
University of Michigan to look for 
an appropriate site and begin con- 
struction of a 36-inch telescope. 

A mass trial of a vaccine against a 
special type of infectious cold is ex- 
pected to get under way within a 
year. It will be similar to the trials 
of the polio vaccine; but instead of 
grade school children, military re- 
cruits will be lining up for shots. 
A vaccine for the grippe-like virus 
colds has already been tried on 
prison volunteers. It prevented the 
sickness in about 70% of the sus- 
ceptible volunteers when the vac- 
cine was “challenged” by doses of 
live virus swabbed into the eye. It 
is expected to give even greater 
protection against naturally caught 
disease, since a person is not likely 
to get such a big dose of virus that 
way. The vaccine caused no reac- 
tion among the volunteers and 
takes effect within ten days to two 
weeks. It will probably protect for 
a year or more, although this fact 
has not yet been proved. 

There may be a whole new con- 
cept of music for the listeners of 
tomorrow. R.C.A. recently an- 
nounced a “music synthesizer” — 
electronic equipment that can imi- 
tate any known musical sound or 
instrument and also create a mul- 
tiplicity of sounds for which there 
is no known mechanical means of 
generation. The device also has an 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



endless capacity for rhythmical 
variation. 

Jet planes may soon be able to 
land on runways only one-third as 
long as those now needed. Engi- 
neers have been experimenting 
with a new type of built-in brake 
for jet craft known as thrust re- 
verses. The reverses scoop up the 
jet blast, diverting it to the opposite 
direction. The devices can poten- 
tially reduce ground roll far more 
efficiently than the parachutes used 
at present. The idea behind them 
is not only to slow down the jets 
on landing, but to brake them in 
mid-air. 

Totally automatic defense of North 
America by guided missiles auto- 
matically directed to their target 
by giant electronic “brains” is only 
a matter of time. This is foreseen 
with the announcement of a new 
electronic system which controls 
aircraft flight and fires the plane’s 
rockets at the proper instant after 
it is within 15 miles of its target. 
When the radar “eyes” spot the 
attacking bomber, the pilot pushes 
a button, locking the radar on tar- 
get. An electronic computer takes 
over, flying the plane on intercep- 
tion course no matter how the 
bomber maneuvers. At exactly the 
correct moment, the rockets are 
automatically launched. 

The U.S. Army has developed a new 
radio transmitter powered by the 
voice of the sender alone. The one- 
and-one-half pound device re- 
quires no batteries or external 
source of power and may be able 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 


to transmit at a range of one mile. 
A tiny companion receiver now un- 
der development would use voice 
energy that had been stored up 
during transmission to power it. 
Together the two would make a 
battery-less walkie-talkie small 
enough to fit into a telephone 
mouthpiece. 

A new experimental machine which 
can print, at the touch of a single 
key, any one of 42 eighteen-char- 
acter words or phrases at the rate 
of 150 words per minute was re- 
cently announced by I.B.M. The 
model is a standard electric type- 
writer. Connected to it is a mem- 
ory system set up in a control panel. 
The typewriter can be used nor- 
mally, but a slight pressure on a 
foot switch converts it into the 
Wordwriter which types the stock 
phrases such as “Dear Sirs:”, “In 
response to your request”, “Yours 
truly”, etc.

Spaceman's air domes may soon be 
dotting the countryside. Inflated 
fabric domes used for housing ra- 
dar equipment have pointed the 
way for practical construction of 
such buildings. Structures such as 
these already in use can withstand 
wind velocities up to 100 miles per 
hour and varying temperature 
changes. Practical aspects of these 
inflated buildings include portabil- 
ity, safety, and unlimited space; 
commercial blowers being the only 
mechanical device necessary to 
maintain the pressure to keep them 
inflated. Researchers at Cornell are 
already constructing a hockey rink 
using this principle.

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

As one of your silent readers who 
has bought your fine book ever 
since it came out without missing 
an ish, I’ve a gripe to give you. 
Why the heck have you gone bi- 
monthly? Good grief, with the 
hokum and bunk several other 
mags offer all the time without 
folding, you’re at least as good as 
any of file rest pubbing monthly. 
The poorer mags as a rule are the 
ones pubbing less often or on a bi- 
monthly schedule. You’ve got a 
first class mag! Why bi-monthly 
then? 

I like the idea of bringing back 
the letter department; also the 
other departments. But you could 
still use a few more. It’s like the 
guy who gets a grade-A steak three 
times a day — he finally gets tired 
of it and wouldn’t mind eating the 
humble bean or potato in between 
— not that there’s anything humble 


about good non-fiction. 

In the February ish, G.A. Kemp- 
ner’s letter is in part foolish. He 
argues that time travel is for the 
birds. So was atomic power 25 
years ago, at least in theory. Then 
he really puts his foot into it re 
telepathy. “. no conclusive evi- 
dence is available at present”. I 
wonder what Dr. Rhine would say 
to this, or what several scores of 
students and scientists who partici- 
pated in conclusive telepathic ex- 
periments would voice in angry re- 
buttal? These people ain’t a bunch 
of Rosicrucians bub! This can be 
considered answer enough to the 
rest in “Hue and Cry” who hold 
with Kempner’s viewpoint. 

How about having Cal Beck do 
some fanzine reviews, club reports, 
movie reviews and similar stuff, 
and get Miller or Knight for book 
reviews. With men like that in IF, 
you’d have about the best mag in 
SF, bar none. 

— Bernard Krumpel 
Newark, N. J. 

See this issue for that non-fiction 
but this is definitely not fC the bean 
and potato” kind. As to the other 
suggestions . how about some 
reader comments? 

Dear Editor: 

I have just finished reading Jim 
McConnell’s very good story 
“Avoidance Situation” and can 
only say “he goofed”. He refers to 
a C 2 drive and a C 2 radio. He 
neglects the fact that C 2 is not a 
velocity. Consider c — 3 x 10 10 
cm/sec. Then c 2 = 9 x 10 20 
cm/sec2. Obviously this is not a 


116 


velocity. 

Now I suppose someone will say 
that he didn’t mean to square the 
units, only the numerical magni- 
tude. Let us see where this leads. 
Considering c 2 as a velocity we 
get: for c — 3 x 10 10 cm/sec, 
c 2 =* 9 x 10 20 cm/sec; for c = 1.86 
x 10 5 miles/sec, c 2 — 3.46 x 10 10 
miles/sec, which is the same as 
5.57 x 10 15 cm/sec; for c — 1 
(light-sec) /sec, c 2 = 1 (light-sec) / 
sec which is the same as 3 x 10 10 
cm/ sec. Obviously the value of 
c 2 depends upon the units used 
in c. 

Now Mr. McConnell says that 
the Terran ship can travel faster in 
subspace than the alien can using 
the c 2 drive. This implies that the 
alien uses the same system of units 
as we do. This is a statistical night- 
mare. The units we use are arbi- 
trary. (This would not be the case 
if we used a distance of 1 light 
unit and a time of the same unit, 
but then c 2 is no faster than c.) 
I cannot see how the alien could 
have the same system. 

— Stuart L. Anderson 
Seattle 22, Wash. 

It would be a coincidence; but 
how else could McConnell get the 
idea across for the non-mathema- 
tician? 

Dear Editor: 

As an old time “sfan” — if I may 
coin such a word at this late date 
in my science-fiction career — I find 
great interest in your articles by 
Forrest Ackerman, whom I knew 
well in the early thirties. His Feb- 


ruary comments on the origin of 
S-F terms particularly intrigued 
me. 

While he did not mention the 
word “scientifilm”, Fve seen it 
used enough to make me take a 
small measure of pride in having 
created that hybrid. If I remember 
correctly, it first appeared in print 
in The Time Traveller , the earliest 
sfan paper, which I edited back in 
1932. Since I don’t have a single 
issue left for reference, FJA or 
some other old-timer may confirm 
my recollection. 

Another word I coin around 
that time was “scientale”, but ap- 
parently it never caught on. Now 
I wonder what “sfandom” will 
think of my latest creation, “sfan”? 
That term seems so natural and ob- 
vious I can hardly believe it’s real- 
ly new; but I haven’t seen it any- 
where else before. 

— Allan Glasser 
Brooklyn, New York 

Any old timers who still have 
copies of The Time Traveller? 
And how about “sfan”? 

Dear Mr. Q: 

I’m getting a little tired of all 
the protesting that only in the lib- 
eral arts can the true gospel of 
Man be found and the tendency to 
make the scientists the scapegoats 
for all the ills of the modem world. 

Too many of today’s men of af- 
fairs are proud that they know 
nothing about science, and as a re- 
sult the world has a philosophy 
that the men of science and engi- 
neering are narrowly materialistic 
and heedless of human values.

Please make the following ob- 
servation: Complete understanding 
of the destructive possibilities of an 
atom bomb does not mean that one 
must be built — somebody has to 
want one. 

The nature of their work being 
what it is, skilled scientists and 
technicians usually work for the 
men of affairs. Can there then be 
so much questioning of their mo- 
tives and values by the “human- 
ists”? 


— J. R. Ryder 
Chicago, 111. 


This has all the earmarks of a good 
controversy . Who’s on who’s side? 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I must air some comments on the 
delightful February issue. The 
Hunter cover and space satellite 
drawings were worth the price of 
the magazine itself. Have one ques- 
tion to ask. When did you change 
art editors? Since I missed the De- 
cember issue, I don’t know whether 
you changed then or with this issue. 

And now to the inside. The short 
novel “Avoidance Situation” was 
extremely good. The writing some 
of the best I’ve seen in a long time. 
The Anderson novelette just didn’t 
seem to click, though I usually like 
his stories very much. The rest of 
the stories were above average. The 
gem of the whole issue is “The 
Drivers” by Ed Ludwig. It’s a most 
thought provoking story which 
takes today’s reckless driving to 
perhaps the ultimate in story tell- 
ing.

See what happens when you miss 
an issue? There’s more to come on 
the satellite too . Better not miss any 
more . 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

I haven’t had a chance to read 
more than a couple of stories in the 
February IF — “The Drivers”, in- 
cidentally was excellent — but as 
usual, I read the letter section and 
features first. May I dip a short 
oar into the controversy over G. W. 
Walton’s viewpoint? 

It’s rather bold to say that any- 
thing is impossible. I can think of 
two circumstances under which 
time travel — physical, that is — 
would be conceivable. One is the 
Einsteinian theory of time as an- 
other dimension of space, on which 
present advanced science is based. 
Under this concept, the future 
exists and has existed just as the 
past and the present and no change 
can be made in it. A theoretical 
time traveler finds that his action 
changes nothing, because he was 
already back at the point to which 
he traveled in time and his influ- 
ence there had a casual effect on 
circumstances before the back- 
ward jump — maybe even caused it. 
It is difficult to see, however, how 
a man could “skip” over a period 
of years in traveling either forward 
or backward in time. 

The other possibility is one 
which has a part in African savage 
religions, the concept of the “fan- 
shaped” destiny. At every moment 
of choice, when the choice is even- 
ly balanced, both courses are taken. 
This of course involves parallel 
time streams, and many parallel 


118 



worlds diverging from every pos- 
sible point. A return to a parallel 
world then would involve no para- 
dox. If we limit ourselves to proven 
facts in our themes, we have no 
science fiction.

See Mr . Fontenay 3 s “Z 33 in this is- 
sue for one Einsteinian time con- 
cept . and tell us what you think . 

Dear Sir: 

Mel Hunter has goofed! Take a 
copy of February IF . turn to 
the inside front cover. Look in the 
upper left hand corner. We see a 
three stager taking off; Minimum 
Orbital Unmanned Satellite of 
Earth. But all three stages have 
wings! Only the first stage needs 
wings and they are just to enable 
it to navigate a shallow orbit 
(straight up is needless and, at 
present, impossible). However, 
there will be no air after Stage I 
falls to earth and Stage II takes 
over as far as airfoils are con- 
cerned. That is, there will not be 
enough air with which to glide. 
Sheer momentum and free fall will 
hold it up.

Mr. Page, you are right! Hunter 
and editor both goofed . The draw- 
ing. of the satellite rocket on page 
35 will bear you out . And don 3 t 
miss the August issue ! 

Dear Editor: 

Have read for years stories and 
articles on space travel that make 


the false assumption that a person 
on the Moon or other planet of 
lighter-than-Earth gravity would 
be able to leap over obstacles of a 
height greater than those he could 
clear on Earth, the height being 
figured as inversely proportional to 
the decrease in gravity. The gentle- 
men who write such “data” say a 
man can jump over a five-foot ob- 
stacle on Earth; on the Moon, 
gravity is only one-sixth as strong; 
therefore he can jump six times as 
high or clear a thirty-foot obstacle! 
Sounds logical, but overlooks some 
of the important facts about how 
people jump — and confuses clear- 
ing an obstacle with lifting the hu- 
man C.G. A six-foot man, standing, 
has a C.G. roughly three and a half 
feet from the ground. In leaping 
over a five-foot barrier, his C.G. 
will clear it by a foot or less; there- 
fore he lifted two and one half feet* 
the other two and one half feet for 
clearing the obstacle being ob- 
tained by tucking up the legs. If I 
haven’t overlooked some factors, 
then a man on the Moon should be 
able to leap over a seventeen-to 
eighteen-foot obstacle, hoisting his 
C.G. 6 x 2*4, or 15 feet pulling his 
legs in for the rest. There should be 
another way to calculate this: a 
man on the moon would weigh one 
sixth of, say, one hundred and 
eighty pounds — or thirty pounds. 
Now, if we knew how fast a man’s 
legs muscles could push an object 
weighing thirty pounds with an 
inertia of one hundred and eighty 
pounds, we could calculate how 
long that six-foot per sec (approxi- 
mate) gravity of the Moon would 
take to stop and retrieve it, and 


m 



how far it would travel before it 
stopped.

How about jumping obstacles un- 
der an air dome on the moon? 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

At present you are up with the 
other top magazines in maintain- 
ing a proper balance between fic- 
tion and the features. However, I 
disagree with Mr. Hallam of the 
Dec. *55 issue, regarding technical 
articles. IF has yet to produce ar- 
ticles as absorbing as those on 
Thiotimiline or the series Origins 
of Galactic Etiquette.

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

How about more stories such as 
Raymond Jones’ “Human Error” 
and Ed Ludwig’s “The Drivers”? 
These have the ring of reality and 
authenticity. If I could have one 
wish, I think I would like to live 
as long as Methuselah. Reincarna- 
tion wouldn’t be the answer — I 
wouldn’t want to miss the next nine 
hundred years. 

How about some more letters 
from lady S.F. fans? Interest in S.F. 
isn’t silly girls, it beats love stories 
all to pieces. Then too, some of our 
great scientists are women. I have 
been an S.F. fan for five years and 
I’m proud of it.

EDITOR'S REPORT 

(Continued from page 3) 

However, as you have no doubt 
surmised by now, their specula- 
tions on the Satellite are not idle 
conjecture but come from a wealth 
of working know-how and personal 
experience. 

The first article (page 34) dis- 
misses the “basketball” idea and 
presents the satellite as a giant 
needle, 19.5 feet in length and one 
foot in diameter, and discusses the 
requirements for getting it into 
space. The second article, which 
will appear in the August issue, 
goes into more detail and describes 
instrumentation, functioning, orbi- 
tal behavior and transmission of 
intelligence. — jlq

HOISTING STAGE TWO INTO POSITION— Forty feet in length, Stage Two 
is shown being hoisted into position atop Stage One, one hundred feet high. 
The twenty foot Stage Three Satellite will be placed in position last. Monster 
gantry rig is built with adjustable crane arm to facilitate simultaneous rapid 
fueling of all three stages just prior to takeoff, in order to minimize boiloff 
of volatile oxidizer. Just before firing, tower will be pulled back to allow 
rocket to stand alone. Blockhouse is underground a half-mile away. Scene 
is near Patrick Air Force Base, Cocoa, Florida. (Drawings by Mel Hunter)
