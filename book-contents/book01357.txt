S AND, fear, blood and gawkers She came yesterday on the day 
— the trivia of a thousand are- of the games after I had neatly 
nas on a thousand planets in a decapitated the former champion 
thousand ages. 1 am an athlete of the Sabre worlds by means 
of great proportions, strength and of wrist pressors only. Declared 
skill — one who kills by order of the season’s Grand Champion, 
the gawkers or my master, head garlanded with red-brandy 
whichever calls first — and I am vines, chest proudly extended 
one soon to be killed. against chest band, I swaggered 



4 




away from the game’s space on 
wrist pressors only, as if to say, 
Look at me, you weaklings. I have 
bested your best. Now who is 
master and who is slave? 

Their sun of a thousand yellow 
rays beat down on my back as I 
pushed my way across the game’s 
space into the lower ramp to my 



cage, expecting there to relax with 
wine, song and the caress of the 
opposite sex as, I suppose, has 
been done by my kind for ages 
past. 

Then she came. The lights 
burned brightly as the crowd 
surged past our flux cages. The 
public was not satisfied with the 



5 



death, pain and sadism of the 
arena, but demanded that my 
cage — all our cages — be kept 
open to public gathering. Like my 
cell-mates I was a freakish one-G 
animal, trained by means of 
gravity-like pressor and tractor 
beams to tear and hew at others. 

She walked with her father. He, 
merely a seven-tenths-G animal, 
was human and shaped like 
myself. He had a strong smile, 
cropped gray hair and rugged 
features set-off by sunken eyes, 
a bulbous nose and bright, straight 
teeth. Oh God! How I hated that 
animal — that all-powerful, all- 
great leader of the Sabre planets. 
Trevic Strenger and his family 
walked in public gathering to view 
me, this season’s Grand Cham- 
pion, in my “natural” habitat! 

First came the retinue of syc- 
ophants and guards. Cloaked in 
tight plastic of weblon to nullify 
pressor and tractor rays, they sta- 
tioned themselves to one side of 
my cage, holding the crowded 
path open for the dictator Strenger 
and his family. 

I threw my wine outward to 
vent my disgust and anger, help- 
lessly watching as it struck the 
surrounding magnetic field, to be 
sucked inward and downward 
instantaneously as the powerful 
field latched onto minute iron 
particles in the liquid. 

They didn’t yield an inch nor 
did they acknowledge my act by 
even a twitch of the mouth — ex- 



cept Trevic Strenger. He passed 
his hand back to his beautiful 
wife and gently tugged her for- 
ward so as not to miss the show, 
just as he did the night I was 
taken, five years ago, on my rocky 
planet. 

I CAME from an unusual brood 
and, had I known then what I 
now know, even their fleetest 
hunters would have gone back to 
the ship empty. My brood cell — 
brothers, sisters, mother and 
father — had left me for the day. 
I tossed rocks at the passing pack 
animals below our cave, not aware 
of the hunters swooping over me, 
preparing to entangle me in their 
rays and beams. I spat at Trevic 
with the thought, and he pulled 
his head back to laugh, just as 
he had the day I was brought, 
bound and struggling before him. 

Oh, I was more than a bar- 
barian from the Planet of Rocks. 
I was an educated barbarian, for 
their pleasure would not be 
enough unless they knew that 
inside of each gladiator lay a 
trapped, cunning and scheming 
modern mind — a mind equal 
perhaps even to their own in 
knowledge, yet trapped by their 
science and their orders to fight 
on a barbaric level of their choice. 
I spat again when I thought of 
their educators and how facts 
were poured into my animal brain 
day and night, indiscriminate 
facts.

IF 




Did you know that a man named 
Plato once said, “Know thyself?” 

I spat again in honor of such 
useless information. 

His wife’s face strained at her 
husband’s sadistic laughter and I 
imagined that she disapproved. 
Then I vowed some day to kill 
Trevic Strenger with my own bare 
hands. I watched the daughter. 

She pushed through the crowd 
and I saw perfection. I had known 
many other women, slave women 
thrown to us along with victory 
wines and victory songs. I had 
seen none with the grace, the 
litheness, the color, the shadows 
of this one. Daughter of a mad 
king and a radiant slave-queen, 
she was — and her eyes seemed 
to glow with a kind of empathy 
for me I had never before known 
outside of the brood chamber. 

I opened my gnarled fists, 
dropping my cups, and sprang to 
the field’s side. My chest band 
pulsed with heat as its magnetic 
field fought against the lines of 
force. I strained my body mightily 
to bring it closer to her side until 
only inches separated us and my 
metal chest-belt glowed cherry red 
from hysteresis. 

Across those billions of lines 
of flux sprang the stronger invisi- 
ble rays of my love. Her blue 
eyes met my gray ones and mine 
clung while the world dissolved 
around us. Though worlds of dif- 
fering customs and a powerful 
kingdom lay between us, I vowed 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



to reach her as deeply and 
strongly as I had just vowed to 
kill her father. 

W OULD PATRICIA STRENGER 
respond to me? Could a 
barbaric brood-world creature 
reach her more refined heart? 
Though doubt assailed my 
thoughts, I clung to my twin emo- 
tions of hate for her father 
and my new-born love for her. 

“Barbarian,” he said, “You 
must come to terms with your 
simple emotions. In you lie only 
the pure emotions — hate, love, 
anger — not any refined, civilized, 
subtle and complex ones.” 

Snarling, I threw my drinking 
vessel at him, only to see it stop 
in mid-air, then retreat backward 
from the invisible wall. He did 
not even laugh at my anger. 

“Our people crave heroes,” 
he continued evenly. “You may 
be a great one. With gladiator 
success come civilized opportuni- 
ties which would normally be de- 
nied one of your kind. You may 
soon see complete freedom, then 
complete citizenship with all the 
rights and privileges of a Sabre 
citizen. Shall we drop this silly 
feud now?” 

Hate boiled in me like a hidden 
volcano and I did not answer. 

Trevic Strenger paused silently 
to watch my heaving chest, then 
added: “After all, barbarian, had 
it not been you who was captured, 
another from your brood world 

7 




would now be standing where you 
are — another would now be of- 
fered full education, citizenship 
and opportunity for world-wide 
adulation.” 

I could not control my emo- 
tions. So complete was my hatred 
for this man who had torn me 
from brood-home that my whole 
muscular body convulsed as I spat 
directly at his face. 

Without change of tone in his 
voice he said, “Tomorrow I will 
introduce you to Urut of Ewit, 
a two-point-five-G champion.” 

I sneered, as I had yet to learn 
of either Ewit or Urut of Ewit 
and therefore lacked com- 
prehension of his plans for the 
morrow. 

Trevic narrowed his browless 
eyes to watch as he bored in with 
his varied rapier-like pieces of 
knowledge, “Urut can crush rocks 
on your planet between his two 
hands. On his world a day lasts 
seven of yours. A day’s work to 
him means seven times twenty- 
four or one hundred and sixty- 
eight of your hours. Can you fight 
him even one of his days. Grand 
Champion?” 

I knew the answer. Urut's skin 
would be as tough as rock, his 
stamina far beyond any normal 
one-G human’s bounds, and his 
strength would be like ordinary 
muscle taut against the pressure 
of invariant hydraulic presses. I 
would most surely die tomorrow. 
I knew it and Trevic Stronger 

8 



knew it. But I spat again in bar- 
baric defiance. 

II 

1 AWOKE in the morning to the 
sounds of tractor and pressor 
duels around me and knew I had 
overslept on this, my last day. 
According to my educated brain, 
thousands of years before a cer- 
tain B. Franklin had said. Early 
to bed and early to rise will make 
a man healthy, wealthy and wise. 

I paused briefly in disgust at 
giving thought to such revolting 
associations. Why had not my 
mind been permitted to remain 
that of a normal brood-world 
barbarian? 

I bound my two pressor beams 
to my wrists and my two tractor 
beams to my ankles and gyrated 
my body through the endless con- 
tortions of tension and counter- 
tension so necessary to the 
modern gladiator. 

I pulled my leg muscles to their 
limit of endurance, slowly . but 
surely overcoming the tractor-ver- 
sus-tractor configuration. Then, 
and so rapidly that the eye 
would be unable to follow, I 
twisted my body muscles to push 
pressor against pressor until, 
biceps bulging, I heard the faint 
clink of wrist plate against wrist 
plate, signifying I had once again 
overcome the hidden power of my 
death machinery. 

Only then did I eat lightly, my 

IF 




good nature returning slowly as 
I felt a sense of well-being. 

Again I passed my body 
through every one of the hard- 
learned exercises designed to test 
to the utmost one muscle against 
another, passing through the last 
just as the aurora at the side of 
my cage indicated that I was to 
move out into the arena. 

To avoid death from chest-band 
pressure, as my cell slowly con- 
tracted around me, I moved for- 
ward, following the energy glow. 
There, under the beat of their 
merciless sun, was the open arena, 
its sand, its hate-driven gawkers, 
its blood of the past and psychic 
blood yet to flow. 

Pushing my way toward the 
ellipsoid’s nearest focus, I then 
squinted to see the squat hulk 
of Urut of Ewit at the far end. 

The crowd of blood-mongers 
surrounding our large cage, except 
at floor level, howled on my entry. 
Knowing I was the handicapped, 
they screamed for Urut’s blood 
which, could I but arrange it, 
would be most happily furnished 
them — for it was his blood or 
mine. 

Almost I felt sorry for that 
hulk — short, broad of torso, leg 
and arm; flat-headed with parrot- 
like lips; humanoid of form and 
lizard-hided of skin. 

M y survival was at stake 
and my mind swiveled back 
to life and death calculations. He 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



had the sun. Trevic Stranger 
would have seen to that. He had 
more. As strong as I was, my 
muscles were but one-G trained. 
As quick as I was, he would act 
faster. Very probably I would not 
find any weak spot in his natural 
armor, whereas to him I was but 
an anthropomorphic jellyfish. 

In a gladiator’s daze I 
calculated my survival paths 
overlong — already he was swim- 
ming toward me with tractors and 
pressors working together. 

No sooner had I tensed to meet 
his first attack than he was 
beyond me, already rebounding 
from the magnetic wall. 

I pushed both tractors outward 
at the widest angle of my legs, 
unconsciously reaching for the 
bedrock which I knew to exist 
there. Both arms were folded 
against my chest band to place 
pressors in their firmest position. 
He struck like a ten-ton boulder 
rolling down the mountainside. 
My muscle-banded legs vibrated 
with the pressure and my reserves 
soon evaporated. 

His right tractor could reach 
around to the side of my head 
to hold while his left reached to 
my right side and I knew scant 
instants stood between me and 
decapitation. 

More in instinctive desperation 
than for any reason I switched 
pressors down low and slipped 
my body under his. He rocketed 
overhead to slam mightily against 

9 




the far side of the arena's shield, 
chest band glowing red, while I 
twisted around from back to belly 
on the sand floor. 

Still no strategy came to my 
mind. Can a pygmy subdue the 
elephant? Can the ant topple the 
pedestrian? Can a simple one-G 
human resist for long the heavy- 
planet man under one>G condi- 
tions? 

I concentrated every bit of 
thought and will on my survival. 
Brute force against inhuman force 
was my only strategy. 

He sliced through the air again 
and I dodged. He brought both 
legs into play to cut me in tw^o 
and I again dodged. He tried the 
ploy of alternating leg tractors and 
arm pressors and I eluded him. 
Not until he sat above me in 
the overhead tractor-lock position 
did my strategy bloom. Though 
only tiny moments of time were 
involved, my thoughts ran as 
follows. 

Why can I dodge this lightning- 
like man so easily? How is it 
he misuses his speed so much? 
Could it be that he is unused 
to fighting in a one-G environ- 
ment — that this is his first ex- 
perience on such a light world? 
If so, his timing must be too fast 
and I am not really eluding him. 
He misses me and then I dodge, 

U SING tractors, pressors, fin- 
gers and toes, I crawled ex- 
cruciatingly slowly across the bot- 

10 



tom until his tractors caught 
bedrock below and I could slide 
out from under. 

He jabbed down with pressors 
but this time I was ready. 1 kicked 
my tractors into his squat belly 
and followed behind his moving 
arms with my own pressors. He 
somersaulted then and pinwheeled 
before catching himself. 

Now 1 had the trick. Every 
time he moved I swung either 
tractor or pressor, catching his 
motion from behind and enforcing 
it. I used his own strength and 
speed against him until finally, 
during one complex maneuver 
where his tractors reinforced his 
pressor movement, I doubly rein- 
forced his action with my pressors 
and tractors and his two arms 
snapped. 

The gawkers screamed and 
howled for blood but I had other 
ideas. Already exhausted, I 
doubted my ability to penetrate 
his thick hide, though he lay help- 
less. More important to me than 
his destruction were the death of 
another and the love of a third. 

Urut floated around and around 
on tractors, frantically twisting his 
body to redirect his dangling arms 
and their pressors. I shot forward 
and spoke for the first time. 

“Urut. Cooperate with me and 
live to fight another day.” 

In a high, squeaking voice he 
warily asked, “What is it you 
want?” 

“I want out of this cage and 

IF 




you can help. What they do to 
me outside and where I go should 
be of no concern to anyone but 
me — and no one will suspect your 
help in what will follow.” 

“What do I do?” 

“I am going to use both 
pressors and tractors to propel 
myself through the cage. Only if 
I go very quickly will my chest 
band remain sufficiently cool for 
me to survive. I am going to place 
myself within range of your trac- 
tors and with their help, and the 
quickness of your legs, I can crash 
through. Will you do this Unit?” 
“But you will die if we are 
not quick enough. Why should 
you place yourself within my con- 
trol when you have already won?” 
“Urut, my friend, you and I 
have no quarrel. We have never 
had. We fight only to survive — 
now let us help each other live. 
I want freedom and revenge. You 
want your life. Why should we 
not bargain?” 

T he crowd began the death 
chant. 

“Blood — blood! Kill the hulk! 
Kill the hulk — ” 

I could tell from their frenzy 
that soon something must be done 
or their passion would be on all 
of us. Urut could also sense it. 
The idea of mutual help was not 
yet fully integrated in his mind 
but he nodded. 

“May your mud-nest be pleas- 
ing!” 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



I swung to the other side of 
the arena to begin my plan. 

From hundreds of previous 
fights I knew every inch of arena 
bedrock and I used the knowledge 
to advantage. I flung wrist 
pressors at each point behind me 
and ankle tractors ahead of me, 
accelerating swiftly in line with 
Urut. The crowd hushed and Urut 
patiently moved his hulk into 
position for the throw. 

I swung past his body swiftly. 
More swiftly still he lashed onto 
me with both tractors webbed 
together. I felt the fringe of their 
beams pass my arms, then my 
head and thick neck absorbed the 
pull and I was flung up to and 
against the magnetic shield sur- 
rounding us. 

My chest band glowed and part 
of my body tried to wrench itself 
backward — but still onward and 
through I passed. I flew over the 
heads of those in the first tiers, 
then plowed into the next ranks. 

Heads popped; chest, arm and 
leg bones snapped. I arose amidst 
the gore of dead and dying 
gawkers. Their hush changed to 
screams. Pandemonium reigned. 

A small number in the crowd 
rushed to the exits but the ma- 
jority stood shouting, “Champion! 
Champion! Champion!” 

Over and over again their ac- 
knowledgment echoed — like the 
beating of surf on the rocky 
shores — until my very bones vi- 
brated with the chant. Never 

II 




before had one escaped the 
magnetic arena and the crowd was 
wild with enthusiasm. 

I should have trusted to my 
judgment of their emotion. My 
next move was utterly foolish. I 
swung out to reach for Trevic 
Strenger, hoping to crush his thin 
neck between my pressors. Above 
and below and all around me flew 
his weblon-encaaed protectors. 

High over me were the plat- 
forms of heavy rays, while on 
each side were the smaller hand 
weapons — but I had agility, speed 
and coordination far beyond those 
of any group of Strenger guards. 
I had one tactic which would 
catch them by surprise. My mus- 
cles were trained to use beams 
but my mind was trained to use 
muscles. With those I bowled over 
the first group, tumbling weapon 
and guard onto the tiers below. 

Ill 

F ighting one-G animals in an 
open environment and with 
full knowledge of their beams and 
rays, I was more than a match 
for them all. But no matter how 
1 hacked and hewed, how cleverly 
I spilled their heavy weapons, I 
still could not reach Strenger. I 
can see him«^yet in my memory, 
sitting back, watching with faint 
amusement as I tossed his guards 
here and there like feathers — only 
to find more guards taking their 
places. 



The gawkers shrieked with 
pleasure over this new form of 
entertainment and I turned and 
ran, dashing up beyond the seat 
rims, finding space between the 
roof and two structural pressor 
beams to squeeze my bulky body 
through. 

Outside the arena I fell several 
hundred feet before my rays 
caught bedrock below and I could 
twist myself across the pylons and 
roadways of this ungodly civiliza- 
tion to search for the city's end 
and silent peace. 

Behind me, perhaps a mile 
away, the guards boiled out from 
the arena area and I swept down 
low below their sight level. 
Another mile and another and 
another — when would the city 
end? 

Then little by little trees, parks 
and farms replaced city blocks, 
until only farm land and tall 
mountains lay ahead. That first 
night I slept in peace among the 
wild foothills of this strange 
world, free for the first time since 
being taken from my brood world. 
In my dreams lived the face of 
Strenger — but also in my dreams 
was the sad, melancholy face of 
Patricia and my body longed for 
both in their proper place. 

The morning sun no longer 
seemed so hot and sultry. The 
air seemed fresher and the planet, 
even with its strange flora and 
fauna, appeared friendly. I 
speared a small carnivore with 

IF 



12 




a tractor beam, drank fresh water 
and ate the raw meat, then washed 
and rested while 1 thought. 

Were I to go back to the city 
my large bulk would easily iden- 
tify me as the Champion. My 
muscles would be impossible to 
hide in this civilization. 

Farmers I knew about because 
of my helter-skelter education — I 
knew, for example, that some Sa- 
bre planet genius had called farm- 
ers stewards of the state. Could 
I trust the farmer not to turn 
me in for one of Strenger’s high 
rewards? I thought not. 

Though I searched my brain 
for other informative tidbits on 
this society, I concluded that only 
the mountains and hills would 
hide me. 

1 REMOVED my tractors and pres- 
sors, fastening them to my chest 
band by means of twisted fibers, 
then unhesitatingly I strode off 
toward the snow-capped moun- 
tains ahead. 

Day followed day and night 
followed night. I easily speared 
game with tractor or pressor while 
I followed the animal trails from 
elevation to elevation. My body 
stayed in trim and my hate grad- 
ually oozed outward as my path 
came closer to the appearance of 
rocky plateaus similar to my 
brood world — all, that is, except 
the tiny, reserved corner of my 
emotions which repeated my need 
over and over. 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



Kill Strenger, 

The rocky path wound upward 
and I trod closer to the snowy 
peaks, my body now covered with 
animal skins for warmth. Slowly 
the rock turned to snow, then 
snow to mixed snow and ice, 
glazing white while I moved on- 
ward and upward, never hurrying, 
never slowing. 

Miles of ice w'ere crossed and 
only once did I have to pull 
myself from a deep crevice by 
means of a tractor beam. Finally 
the downslope snow line was 
reached on the mountain’s other 
side. I stepped with relief into 
familiar rocky plateaus, fully ex- 
pecting a similar leisurely pace 
downward. Then it happened. 

It was Strenger again. I was 
caught. His men dropped the cage 
neatly over my body and turned 
the field on high. He came from 
behind the rocks with his bold 
smile and just looked, hands fold- 
ed against his chest. 

“The gawkers now love you, 
barbarian, and we can still make 
a truce. Come, I invite you to 
bury your hatred. You are one 
of the greatest of our world’s 
champions — over all time — and it 
saddens me, your waste. By 
popular demand 1 can now release 
you from gladiator status to be- 
come a free citizen. But how can 
I permit a hate-driven barbarian 
to roam free among us?” 

I showed my feeling by emitting 
a low growl. I clenched my fists>

imagining his thick neck in my 
hands. 

Trevic beckoned his retainers 
to lower the cage. He found a 
convenient rock upon which to 
sit while he pleaded his case again 
with me. 

“Know this, barbarian. Your 
use of tractor and pressor beams 
can be traced wherever you go 
on the Sabre planets. Even so, 
you have no further need for 
them, no matter w'hat your 
decision.” 

He motioned with his finger 
and my cage began to tighten until 
my chest band squeezed me from 
all directions. Weblon-encased 
tools drove through my shield and 
skillfully cut my beams from my 
chest band, after which the cage 
was restored in size. 

“Your chest band is made of 
the world's strongest metal. It 
cannot be removed without special 
scientific tools. Wherever you 
wear it, you are subject to imme- 
diate seizure and capture. Do you 
still wish these marks of the glad- 
iator?” 

My tongue finally loosed. 

1 spoke in an angry voice, “You 
tore me from my brood-world 
without my permission, mad king, 
and I shall one day kill you!” 

Unable to reason with me 
further, he beckoned his men for- 
ward. My cage was lifted by 
weblon devices and I continued 
my trans-mountain flight as his 
captive. 



T hey towed me farther into 
the mountains, disregarding 
any inconvenience inertia might 
make to my caged body. My chest 
band glow'ed again and again as 
my body bounced off the cage’s 
sides. 

Perhaps fifty miles inward, we 
followed another rocky path down 
to the valley of our destination. 
Below us, laid out in neat 
geometrical array, were the energy 
cages of thousands of humans. 

Walking like tiny bugs between 
each cage were the weblon- 
protected guards who passed out 
either food or water or else the 
whip — whichever seemed most 
appropriate for the moment. 

A scrap of random information 
forced its way into my conscious 
mind — forced, I suppose, by the 
association of the antUke men far 
below. Only a century ago some- 
one named G. Harcel had said 
“Men are tiny bugs once they 
have seen their souls.” 

Could any information be more 
useless at a time like this? 

High on one side were the mine 
tailings, glistening red from the 
evening sun. Immediately behind 
those tailings stood the factory, 
puffing out streamers of noxious 
gases which, I eventually learned, 
represented part of the physical 
and chemical wastes resulting 
from separating weblon metal 
from the ores found deep in the 
planet’s crust.

IF 




My cage was tugged next to 
a larger one. The aurora along 
the side, signifying an opening in 
my cage, burned brightly and I 
hurried across into the larger. 
Trevic Strenger paid his last 
respects then. 

“Enjoy your new lessons, bar- 
barian. When you have learned 
more, find a way to contact me. 
Perhaps we may yet be friends.” 

He walked away and I flung 
myself furiously at my magnetic 
shield. 

My routine was simple. Each 
day, every day, I was chained 
to a row of ten other prisoners 
who walked two miles along the 
valley floor and three miles 
downward on sloping shafts to 
our work area. Here alternating 
tractor-pressor beams were given 
to us, each a model considered 
too large for a single human to 
support. 

Two of us would hold the 
mining tool, aiming it at the green 
streak of weblon metal running 
throughout the enormous, partly 
natural and partly man-made 
caverns. The alternating tractor- 
pressor forces acted swiftly on the 
cavern walls, grinding all but the 
impervious weblon metal to thin 
mono-molecular layers. 

Follow-up crews sucked up the 
dust-mixed metal and transported 
it back to the surface, where 
further chemical and physical 
processes separated the pure 
weblon metal from the mono- 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



molecular dust layers. Large ships 
transported the purified weblon to 
other industrial locations for 
treatment into forms and shapes 
for use wherever beam neutrality 
was required. 

I T WAS obvious from the begin- 
ning that I was different from 
the others. Most were political 
prisoners with only puny muscles. 
Most werie gregarious creatures, 
friendly with one another, some 
counting days until their release 
while others were hopelessly 
resigned to making the best of 
a lifetime under lock and chain. 

Though I was as sociable as 
anyone on my brood world, here 
I snarled and spat until, like one 
with a great scabrous disease, I 
was avoided by all. 

Enemies were easy to make. 
The chip on my shoulder was 
as big as a sturdy oak, balanced 
precariously and waiting patiently 
for anyone to tip its trunk toward 
the ground. 

It took only one or two short 
tussles for my strength, agility and 
training to show. 

We were fed in line and nor- 
mally the distance between my 
chained figure and others in my 
line was the maximum length of 
chain between us. One day a par- 
ticularly fast, aggressive person 
bumped against my broad body 
in his eagerness to get nourish- 
ment. I swung around snarling, 
grabbed his neck between my 

I5 




giant paws and began to squeeze 
the life from him. 

Only the whips of the guards 
and the combined pulls of other 
prisoners dragged me from his 
body while life still throbbed in 
him. 

Another day my reflexes were 
sufficiently quick to grab the whip 
from a guard as he swung its 
tip toward me. I turned the whip 
around and nearly lacerated the 
guard to death before others could 
stop me. 

That was the day all of them, 
prisoners and guards alike, com- 
bined positive efforts against me. 
That I was not only asocial but 
beyond the restraints of any or- 
dinary prison had now become 
obvious. 

In the first attempt at my life 
one of the heavy tractor-pressor 
beam generators was tipped on 
me from a height of about fifteen 
feet. Fortunately my gladiator- 
honed senses caught the move- 
ment and 1 easily side-stepped and 
safely evaded what seemed to me 
was the generator's slow fall. I 
didn't catch on then. 

The next time a small, wiry 
prisoner pushed his body against 
mine in such a way that I tumbled 
backward into the yawning black 
chasm below us. I twisted and 
caught the edge of the chasm’s 
rim and quickly drew myself up- 
ward. 

Already the guards had moved 
my attacker beyond reach, passing 

16 



him quickly to the surface to be- 
come part of a different and 
unreachable work crew. It was 
then I began to suspect. 

O NE day the guards left our 
work crew. All became quiet 
and I looked up from my work 
to see every eye staring at me. 
Some had grasped rocks and 
stones while others grabbed the 
neck chains lying nearby. Slowly 
the group closed in on me, eyes 
glazed and muscles taut. 

I moved swiftly to my glad- 
iator’s stance and waited quietly. 
Every sense on the alert, I could 
place every one of the nine around 
me. How little they knew of my 
training. None had access to glad- 
iator power-beams and I was 
now faced with a purely two- 
dimensional problem. 

The rocks came fiVst and I 
easily dodged them. Then, in 
quick resolve, all nine swooped 
in toward me. I rushed through 
the circle, grabbing the nearest 
one holding the chain. Lifting him 
from the ground I flailed the 
group, though the chain was still 
held by two others. Those poor 
misguided point-seven-G fools had 
no concept of a gladiator’s 
training and strength. 

I flailed until it seemed that 
none survived. But two had 
climbed above me during the 
melee to redirect the mining beam 
at my body. 

I am . quick and w'ell coor- 

IF 




dinated but even I could not move 
as fast as their fingers on the 
machine’s switch. 

Quite probably the alternating 
tractor-pressor beam had never 
been used on human flesh around 
these prisoners before. They cer- 
tainly had no knowledge of the 
effect of the beams when used 
this way. I stood my ground and 
let the waves of current ripple 
through my body, neither resisting 
nor helping the flow of alternate 
tugs and pulls, and my gladiator- 
trained body as well as my water- 
based tissue withstood the strains 
well. Every piece of metal I 
wore — including my hated chest 
band and the newly attached neck 
band — disintegrated into mono- 
molecular powder as fine as any 
created in the weblon mines. I 
was truly free of their hated in- 
struments of capture now. 

I leaped to the machine's top 
and from there crushed my at- 
tackers’ heads like eggshells. Now 
only I, the mining machine and 
the solitude of the caverns re- 
mained in this branch of the tun- 
nel. I wondered how long I had 
before the guards returned? 

Behind me lay certain capture. 
Directly ahead of me lay granitic 
rock, but to my side lay the deep, 
perhaps more dangerous chasm. 
What choice did 1 have? 

I picked up the mining tool 
and chain, using the latter to tie 
“the tool to my back. Then slowly, 
using trained fingers and toes, I 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



picked my way down the steep 
crevice’s side, using the slightest 
of indentations along the wall to 
support my own two hundred 
pounds and the additional two 
hundred on my back. 

Down I crawled. Down until 
my fingers and toes were sore 
beyond description — down until I 
reached the first ledge. Here I 
rested, conserving my strength for 
the next lap downward. Again and 
yet again I traveled downward, 
resting from ledge to ledge, 
sometimes finding one only when 
it seemed that my last reserves 
of strength had been reached. 
Would 1 never reach the bottom? 

I DROPPED pebbles down the 
long, dark, silent tube, hearing 
only the sibilance of air sweeping 
around its path — never hearing 
splash or bounce of its final strike. 
It was then I paused to consider. 

It was highly doubtful that I 
could go up again and going 
farther down seemed useless. Now 
was the time to unlimber my 
mining instrument. 

Then I pointed the alternating 
tractor-pressor inward against the 
chasm's wall and powdered my 
way forward. The first layer 
powdered at my feet and swept 
outward into the chasm below. 
Soon I was scrabbling with hands 
and knees to force the dust 
backward behind me. Fortunately 
the mono-molecular layers filled 
less space than their more com- 

17 




plcx forms and air from the cliasm 
swept in behind me as the stone 
ahead powdered to the floor. 

Mile after mile I bored ahead. 
When tired, I rested. Then I bored 
again for miles. Days passed. 
Even my gladiator's physique suf- 
fered from lack of nourishment. 
My body became sluggish, my 
mind tormented by memories of 
the sneering laughter and red- 
spurting throat of Trevic Strenger 
and by the graceful body and full 
lips of his daughter. The latter 
vision filled my mind to overflow- 
ing until my muscles responded. 

I pressed on, even forgetting 
which way was up and which 
down and distrusting my fatigued 
senses for knowledge of either 
direction. 

Dust filled my mouth, my eyes, 
my ears and, it seemed, even my 
mind, until I could go no farther. 
With one last effort at survival 
I shoved my poundage and my 
machine against the wall, lurched 
forward. Under sudden accelera- 
tion both the machine and my 
body fell outward and down as 
the thin wall between my tunnel 
and the opening broke through. 

My body revolved around and 
around. Centrifugal force flung 
my arms and legs outward as I 
plunged through a narrow fissure. 

I strained my back, neck and 
belly muscles to bring my turning 
to a stop but did not succeed. 
Light glimmered several hundred 
feet below and my frustrated mind 



focused on it until my spinning 
made it appear a whole galaxy 
of light particles swinging around 
me in tighter and tighter circles. 
My mind let go. 

My back and head hit the water 
first. To this day, I am unaware 
of the extent of the true damage 
done to me in the fall. 

V 

H ow long did I lie there? 

Weeks? Days? Minutes? No 
one will ever know. I do know 
that hundreds of thousands of 
scraps of their educative process 
passed through my mind, only one 
of which I remembered on 
regaining consciousness. 

“ The time has come,’ the 
Walrus said, ‘to talk of many 
things: Of shoes — and ships — and 
sealing wax — Of cabbages — and 
kings — ’ ” 

Could any thought have been 
more out of place and foolish 
or less useful? 

On returning to consciousness, 
I found my body to be whole 
and undamaged but bruised ter- 
ribly. Water was washing over me. 
Some trickled into my open mouth 
and some laved my nose and ears, 
trailing my hair downstream like 
fine wires extended. 

My right arm lay under me, 
touching the rocky stream bed 
below. My left arm lay partially 
submerged, the hand resting on 
a shallow bank. 



18 



IF 




My legs were upstream, resting 
on rock. My eyes were pasted 
shut by the dust around their rims. 
Soon I became aware of the 
mining tool’s soft hum and the 
gentle tugging and pulling of my 
flesh under its influence. 

I waved my right hand around 
in a circle and felt the broken 
chain with which I had attached 
the mining tool to my chest. I 
scraped mud from my swollen 
eyes, opened them and found I 
could see. Phosphorescent parti- 
cles emitted sufficient photons for 
me to view my surroundings 
dimly. The mining instrument was 
on and pointed steadily in my 
direction. 

I drank until my shrunken belly 
was fully distended, then lay back 
to rest and to sleep peacefully 
under the gentle vibration and 
hum of the tractor-pressor beam. 
Probably never before in history 
had a human being been subjected 
so long to the rapid alternate pull 
and push of the tractor-pressor 
beam. Would its effect be 
harmful? I didn’t know. 

When I awoke I crawled again 
to the stream, taking my fill. 
Below me I could see the shining 
shapes of water creatures, among 
them the unmistakably welcome 
shape of a fish. I struck with 
my right hand and grabbed the 
unwary creature tightly. Its cold 
flesh furnished my first nourish- 
ment in what seemed like months 
but may have been only days. 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



A gain I slept, then ate and 
slept again. Later I walked 
over to my mining instrument and 
turned it off. 

I felt light-headed, but oddly 
healthy and not in the least tired. 
I attributed this to the effect of 
poisons manufactured by my own 
system under unusual stress and 
at the time had no idea of the 
damage done to my body. I could 
have acted no differently under 
the conditions. Suffice it to say 
that I felt unusually alert and full 
of a sense of well-being, though 
attributing all of these charac- 
teristics to normal results of ex- 
cessive stress. 

I began my long walk along 
the stream hopefully toward light, 
air and freedom, packing the 
mining instrument on my back 
once more. The walls of the 
stream bed became narrower. 
Soon they reached a point where 
my broad shoulders could no 
longer squeeze through. My way 
forward was finally halted by 
granite blocks. 

With almost a swagger of con- 
fidence, certainly more than the 
moment warranted, I unlimbered 
the tractor-pressor and blasted my 
way out. 

T he ship waited for me at 
my exit point. Of course 
— use of tractor or pressor beams 
anywhere on the planet could be 
easily followed by Strenger and 
his men. 

19 




I turned too late to reenter my 
cavern retreat. A rock bounded 
from my head and I fell forward 
to lie unconscious once again. 

When I gained consciousness, 
my feet were trussed together, my 
arms tied behind my back and 
my head ached. I was in a cabin. 
Two gnarled men sat in front of 
me, alternately eating and gawk- 
ing. Was I back in the arena? 
Were these my new keepers? 

I strained at the bonds on my 
hands and feet but the ties were 
stronger than I. I humped my 
body to a sitting position and 
looked at my two captors, hatred 
washing through me in waves. 

“Pretty, ain’t he?” the one on 
my left said to the other. 

“Needs a bath though. Think 
we could oblige him?” 

Both stopped eating. One tied 
a drag rope to my legs and hauled 
me outside the cabin to a nearby 
spring. My flesh was torn and 
bleeding from the sharp rocks and 
sticks over which I was dragged 
and my head was still dizzy from 
the blow on my head but I uttered 
no complaint. 

They pulled the rope end over 
an overhanging rock until I was 
dangling upside down over the 
water, my head scant inches from 
its surface. I took a deep breath, 
expecting the worst. It came. I 
was dunked under water seven 
or eight times, probably saved 
from drowning only by my one-G 
physique and high lung capacity. 




I was dragged back into the 
cabin, trussed up against the post 
and forgotten for the time being. 

T hey finished their dinner, 
checked various instruments 
lying around the cabin, then turn- 
ed back to me. The older 
one — gray-haired and with a 
stubble-covered chin — was the 
first to speak directly to me. 

“You might as well tell us why 
you were snooping around our 
private weblon mine. It’s your 
only chance of saving your life.” 
My mind, now quite confused, 
failed to function as quickly as 
it might have under gladiator 
conditions. I said nothing.

IF 




me and said, “]f you are a I coughed some water from my 



government agent we will let you burning lungs and said, “I am 



go free on another planet. It’s a gladiator. I have no name.” 



BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 21 



“All gladiators have names,” 
the first one said. “Besides, what 
would a gladiator be doing using 
pressor-tractor equipment in these 
mountains? Come on, iellow — if 
you value your life — tell us the 
truth.” 

I strained every muscle of my 
body to burst the bonds. At last 
my body sagged. I knew a spasm 
of futility before I lost con- 
sciousness again. 

I came to inside their ship. The 
interior was pure luxury and there 
I learned how the gawkers had 
searched for me in vain. I was 
one of the most popular heroes 
of all Sabre history — my life was 
public property and not even 
Trevic Strenger, dictator over all, 
would dare to violate it openly. 

But no trace of me was found 
until my mining equipment had 
been sensed by these law- violating 
miners near their illegal mine. 

I was kept bound inside their 
ship while they checked and 
double-checked my now clean- 
shaven features with pictures 
taken during my gladiator days. 
Convinced I was truly the escaped 
Grand Champion, they struck my 
bonds, not knowing how close 
they were to true death at the 
moment. 

I soon learned that everywhere 
I was loved by the people. But 
I felt certain that I would still 
be unsafe anywhere on a planet 
ruled by Trevic Strenger and his 
type. 

22 



I STAYED with the mining ship, 
hoping to get back to my brood 
world one day. But how could 
I flee when my two goals of hate 
and love were here? Not only 
would deserting them be unnatural 
to my brood training — it was un- 
natural to the ' unusual state of 
my biology, still deeply hidden 
from my conscious processes. 

Still, in violation of every 
instinct, I left civilization behind 
to flee toward the Planet of Rocks 
of my birth. Seven long light-years 
lay ahead, meaning months of 
travel. Hundreds of thousands of 
strange worlds would be silently, 
unknowingly passed as we sped 
onward. How many contained 
brood worlds? How many had 
produced two-and-a-half-G mon- 
strosities like Urut of Ewit? How 
many contained Patricia Strengers 
or Trevic Strengers? How many 
had educated barbarian cham- 
pions and how many even held 
the humanoid form? 

The days passed slowly. I be- 
came acquainted with the two 
outlaws. An objective study of 
their patterns of behavior gave 
me a certain recognition of their 
finer shadings of emotions. All 
three of us were outside the law 
but these two still subscribed to 
certain ethics and species-assisting 
patterns of behavior — much as 
each of the brood helps another 
for the sake of survival of the 
whole. 

Unlike the brood, they had days 

IF 




when their minds were dominated 
by mixtures of pure emotions. 
They certainly exhibited pure 
forms of overt anger and calm 
complacency but they also showed 
fine shadings of moroseness and 
languor. I began to recognize 
emotional subtleties and, for the 
first time, began to question my 
pure hatred response to Trevic 
Strenger. Was he really as bad 
as I had projected or did he, too, 
have comprehensible feelings and 
behavior-motives mixed into his 
treatment of me? 

One day I noted the outlaws’ 
deep concern for one dial on the 
ship’s panel. Daily the dial’s in- 
dicator swung upward and daily 
other instruments were checked 
and rechecked against it. Presently 
I read their concern — patrols were 
on our path. A whole fleet crawl- 
ed toward us, closing in slowly. 

There are no maneuvers that 
can deceive a determined fleet. 
Our only hope lay in an act of 
some god who, out of the 
goodness of his being and the 
emptiness of space, would reach 
outward and hand us some device 
or means by which to escape. 

To make matters worse, I had 
no place to stand and make the 
fight mine, using my gladiator’s 
training. I felt trapped like an 
animal and could almost feel 
civilization’s magnetic cages crush 
through my bones again. My 
chest, where I had worn the metal 
band of servitude, had healed and 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



was covered with keloids. I 
wanted no more slavery. 

One slim hope remained to me. 
My captors searched the directory 
for any kind of planet with 
breathable air. Then they began 
long-range perturbation analysis 
of surrounding stars, hoping to 
spot planets within range. 

One bright yellow sun on our 
pathway seemed to offer hope and 
they quickly adjusted our route 
slightly to pass near its planets. 
We swung inward in a giant 
cycloidal loop, and an automatic 
analysis assured us that one 
planet, fourth from center, had 
breathable, oxidizing air. 

But now our range was with- 
in the patrol’s striking power and 
their beams reached out for hun- 
dreds of thousands of miles to 
vibrate our craft ceaselessly. 

Though weakened structurally, 
we recklessly approached the 
planet’s atmosphere, dropping 
swiftly into its density to skip and 
skip again as the craft was buf- 
feted by the force of its own 
passage. Now weakened further 
and red from heat, it plunged at 
even sharper angles until its tail 
section broke off and our front 
portion spun uncontrolled toward 
the water below. 

VI 

T he miners must surely have 
been killed in the plunge. 
At the time I attributed my sur- 

23 




vival to my gladiator's training 
and my powerful physique. I had 
bunched my muscles together and 
dived out the ship an instant 
before it splashed. 

I hit hard, maybe as hard as 
Unit had hit me. Maybe a little 
harder — I don't know. In any case 
my body sustained the shock and 
I swam to the surface, spotting 
land perhaps ten miles away. 
Toward this I swam and just 
before sundown reached the sandy 
beach where I lay in exhausted 
stupor. 

The jungle ahead of me was 
unrecognizable. Whether fern or 
animal, flora or fauna, I could 
not tell. Only experience would 
show. 

Food was my immediate con- 
cern. Next came shelter and 
water. I rose, rather unnaturally 
recovered, and strode confidently 
into the strange organic con- 
figurations ahead. 

Suddenly my emotional com- 
plex dropped from open elation 
and overwhelming optimism to 
complete apathy. Death would 
have seemed a pleasant release. 
Striving always with my glad- 
iator’s training and the stub- 
borness born of brood world, I 
consciously searched everywhere 
without success — no recognizable 
cause was creating my emotional 
void. 

Down the scale of emotions my 
feelings plummeted — and slowly 
and silently the fibrous matting 



of the jungle undulated toward 
me. It was white with streaks of 
gray running through it and gave 
the appearance of some broad- 
patterned. supine foliage which 
moved like a leech. Who could 
tell what it really was? I wanted 
to back away but my apathy was 
too deep. I stood in an abandon- 
ment of despair, even squatting 
so the slimy thing could more 
easily flow up my body. 

My apathy was dense — as 
dense as thick glue — and the thing 
nearly covered my back. I squat- 
ted lower to let it cover more 
of me, then felt its acid trickle 
over my skin. Apathy pre- 
vailed — nonetheless, under the 
stimulus of pain, my gladiator’s 
instinct snapped my body erect 
and my hands and feet flung the 
horrible thing from me. 

Acid had etched the skin all 
over my back, neck, arms and 
shoulders. Just as suddenly as the 
skin had been destroyed my body 
began its preconditioned, rapid 
repairs, though at the time I was 
too busy to give the phenomenon 
thought. 

I WAS not yet safe, however. The 
thing flowed toward me as be- 
fore and my apathy was as leaden 
as before. Why should I move 
when all of life seemed so useless, 
so hopeless? W. Shakespeare did 
not quite say it, but my mind, 
sunken in depths beyond con- 
scious control and mired in the

IF 




facts of the educators, paraphras- 
ed it as: “O mighty bar- 

barian — dost thou lie low? Are 
all thy conquests, glories, 
triumphs, spoils, shrunk to this 
little measure?” 

I will say this about the 
paraphrase — at least there was 
some relation between its seman- 
tics and my condition of the mo- 
ment, though there was little else 
to recommend it. 

Yet my fighting instinct had 
been aroused and at another level 
of my being I exploringly fought 
back. First I strove for excitement 
and the adrenalin lift which ac- 
companies it. Then I strove to 
force enthusiasm into the cellular 
portions of my body — to no avail. 
Whatever force the thing had, my 
manufactured enthusiasm was not 
the answer. 

I let my body freely wage swift 
endocrine war as my emotions 
tore from cheerfulness through 
antagonism, overt anger, covert 
anger, resentment, fear, grief and 
apathy. Nothing manufactured by 
my b(^y for my body helped. 

As the thing crawled closer I 
switched my endocrine war out- 
ward against the whole world of 
loops and snakelike whorls around 
me, raging within my soul but 
nonetheless subtly spouting tor- 
rents of emotion outward through 
some unseen orifice of my stilled 
body. 

It was when I again hit the 
apathy band that the thing stilled. 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



Each time my body broadcast 
apathy, it retreated a little farther. 
My body had instinctively found 
the key to survival on this planet. 
The thing’s emotional load lifted 
from my body. Again I felt 
lighthearted and full of a sense 
of health, though I still poured 
tons of black apathy at the 
crawling thing now scurrying away 
so rapidly. 

I turned back to the tangle 
of organic misshapes and little by 
little ferreted out its secrets. The 
ropy black serpent-like form 
dangling from above responded to 
fear. The flapping fan-like objects 
responded to overt anger and the 
other dangers responded to other 
emotions either singly or in com- 
bination. 

N o SINGLE entity could easily 
be identified as food, but 
now that I was learning to walk 
through the jungle by casting my 
emotions externally here and 
there, I followed the first stream 
upward with hopes of learning 
what was edible and what was 
not. Clearly the acid and base- 
forming entities were inedible. 
Time after time I succumbed to 
all their emotional complexities, 
learning only after their acidic or 
basic sting to fling them off and 
redirect my emotions outward. 
Time after time, my skin rapidly 
healed itself. 

Order began to appear from 
the chaos surrounding me. I 

25 




watched the slinker root, a slob 
of jellylike flesh that looked like 
a weathered tree-root from my 
Planet of the Rocks, as it flushed 
out its quarry, a small blob of 
milksac covered with horny pro- 
jections. 

Using almost pure fear, its 
emotion swept outward to cover 
growths of pink and purple 
velvety layers of some vertical 
materials. From the bottom of this 
growth the milksac animals — if 
that’s what they were — rushed 
directly toward the j e 1 1 y 1 i k e 
growth. 

There they were easily held un- 
til the chemical base dissolved 
their vital layers, after which they 
were absorbed into the attacker’s 
system. 

For lack of better hunch, I 
followed the next jellylike sack. 
It captured a victim, I tore it 
away from its grasp, using my 
hands for the act of tearing and 
my emotions for the act of 
neutralizing the strange beast. 

I placed the juices of the in- 
jured beast on my tongue and 
found them sweet — but some 
poisons are sweet. I didn’t know 
the difference but my body 
did — or so I thought at the time. 

I chewed and swallowed and 
stayed healthy. Looking back on 
the experience now, I wonder. Did 
my body adapt to the alien food 
or did my instinct determine what 
was food and what was not? 

I ate my way across thousands 



of miles of outrageous growths 
and forms as I traveled from coast 
to coast across one great conti- 
nent. Occasionally I hid from 
search ships — the Patrol would 
not rest until our bodies were 
discovered, I reasoned. I left no 
daily trail by use of tractor or 
pressor beam and my human body 
could hide among the fibrous, 
gelatinous, oozing, slinking, stink- 
ing mess around me. 

I crossed two mountain ranges, 
walking high above the life- 
plateau, living for weeks on air, 
water, fat and determination. 
Lonely pools of water were to 
be found at these higher levels. 

T he longer I survived in tliat 
emotional jungle the more 
grip I had on my own emo- 
tions — until I could instantly turn 
up the emotion of hate against 
Trevic Strenger or the passion 
and hunger of love for his 
daughter. 

I soon was aware of his ships 
less often and rightly assumed 
their surveillance of the planet to 
be more or less precautionary and 
automatic. 

Now I wanted the ships down, 
but only under my own terms. 
The problem was to attract their 
attention in order to make them a 
bit suspicious — ^but not overly 
so — and to trap the trappers. 

Fire is common to most 
planets — but during a year’s sur- 
vival on this one, I had never 

IF 



26 




seen a conflagration. I assumed 
that the patrol would also have 
observed this obvious fact. Could 
I make the unnatural happen by 
natural means? 

The unnatural did happen but 
in a different way. I found a large 
piece of metal with fused pieces 
and burned spots. Either our ship 
or another had caused this piece 
to be flung across the continent 
where it burned and fused on en- 
try into the atmosphere; but 
whatever the true case, I had the 
part I needed to attract Strcngcr's 
persistent watchers. 

Above the organic line, which 
is also above the rain line, are 
mountains, thin dry air and pools 
of water resting in bowls of rock 
lined with streaks of nearly pure 
lead. No w'eather or natural 
disturbance occurs at these heights 
or does so only occasionally. The 
pools are remnants of another era 
in the planet’s ecology. 

Before placing my plan into 
action, I had much work ahead 
and hoped my body was equal 
to its task. First, I found the pool 
nearest to the organic growth line. 
The pool I chose featured rocks 
jutting overhead. From one of 
these overhangs I tossed in more 
stones until the pile below the 
water’s level was nearly to its sur- 
face. 

I then lowered a large organic 
membrane to this new rock level 
under the surface, folding it into 
a kind of loosely formed bag with 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



its corners and sides above water. 
I tied the corners together loosely 
and tied the other end to a rock 
overhead. 

Within the newly separated 
layer of water I slowly lowered 
the spaceship’s metal part, keep- 
ing one end high above the rock 
projection and lowering the other 
end to the bottom of the water- 
filled bag. 

I tied another piece of organic 
rope to the top of the metal struc- 
ture and looped its end to a rock 
some seven feet back from the 
water’s edge. Then, carefully, I 
pulled on the metal, bending it 
farther and farther until it just 
touched a streak of partially ox- 
idized lead jutting from the banks 
of the pool. Again and again I 
pulled the metal until I was in 
absolute control of its motion and 
could touch the lead streak with 
the ease of long practice. 

T he next day I drove hun- 
dreds of organic entities 
ahead of me, using only the 
apathy band, for I had learned 
that this emotion was associated 
w'ith acid-bearing life. Up the 
rocks tliey tumbled and rolled, 
gyrated, squirmed and crawled 
until the pool was reached. 

When the pool was made suffi- 
ciently acid by these monsters, 
I went after the base-bearing kind, 
using covert hostility for the drive, 
and I also drove them into the 
pool without qualms. There the 

27 




the bases partially neutralized the 
acids, forming a serviceable elec- 
trolyte. 

How many beasts of which kind 
should I drive to create the huge 
battery I wanted? I did not know. 
Neither did I know about the per- 
meability of the membrane sec- 
tioning off some liquid from the 
rest, nor the difference in elec- 
trolytic potential between the 
streaks of partially oxidized lead 
crawling along the pond’s basin 
and the unknown metal now jut- 
ting above the pond’s surface. 
With so many unknowns I could 
only try — perhaps to fail and try 
again. 

After rest I pulled the metal 
down to the lead streak by means 
of the attached rope and was 
rewarded by observing a weak 
spark as the gap nearly closed. 
1 returned to the herding of more 
creatures. Night came and the 
following day and I still herded 
creatures to the pond, testing the 
spark size with every new batch. 

I hoped that the spark of light 
could be seen from a spaceship 
at night — or at least that the elec- 
tro-magnetic waves radiating from 
the source would alert the pa- 
trolling monitors. I had not 
figured on the quick response 
which actually occurred. 

I was driving my last batch 
of creatures ahead when the ship 
came. I crouched behind the rocks 
to watch when the rays hit and 
I was stuck rigid to the spot. 



Through instruments of science 
or intellect, possibly both, they 
had outwitted me again. I was 
incapable of moving a muscle. 

The ship I had seen was the 
decoy. Another one had landed 
somewhat earlier to trap me. 

vir 

T here were tw^o of them, one 
on either side of me, and 
they held me fast with heavy por- 
table pressors. I strained with 
every bit of muscle tissue to no 
useful end. 

All around me the life I had 
driven from the jungle below 
boiled in confusion and from that 
movement came my idea. I sum- 
moned my energy and emoted 
apathy, driving the group toward 
one of the men. He faltered, then 
fell under the onslaught. The 
other also slumped. The pressors 
slipped from me and I ran to 
each man in turn. One pressor 
I threw into the acid pond. The 
second I focused on the ship, 
wedging it between two rocks. 

I turned to the fallen men. One 
was encrusted with an acid which 
had eaten deeply. Almost dead, 
he would be of no help to me. 
The other was visibly shaken. I 
ran my own emotional output 
back up and down the scale 
several times until I could key 
into his basic confusion, then 
brought him up to a comfortable 
emotional level. 

IF

“How many arc in the ship?'’ 
I quietly asked. 

“Three. But who arc you? What 
are you doing alone on this sur- 
realistic planet?” 

Now it's strange, but up to that 
point I had not thought of myself 
as a name. On the planet of my 
birth I was just one of the brood 
and could easily be identified by 
smell or appearance. On the Sabre 
planet I was known as barbarian 
or Champion or Grand Champion. 
Here on an alien planet, under 
an alien sun, I was again being 
asked a most fundamental ques- 
tion whose answer I could not 
give. 

“Are you on regular patrol 
around this planet?” I asked. 

“Yes.” 

“What are your duties?” 

“We are to observe and report 
any slightest irregularity in shape 
or phenomenon or behavior over 
the whole planet's surface.” 

“How long has your patrol had 
the planet under surveillance?” 

“Better than a year. Ever since 
outlaws were seen to approach 
the planet.” 

I moved the patrolman closer 
to the pressor beam so that I 
could more quickly reach its con- 
trols if I needed to. 

“What did you expect to find 
here?” I asked. 

“None of us knows. We merely 
take orders. We sighted the pond’s 
heat activity by auto-infrared sur- 
veillance and watched you at 

BRCX)D WORLD BARBARIAN 



work. It was then we laid our 
trap to capture you and find out 
what was happening.” 

“Are you a follower of the glad- 
iators?” I asked. 

“Who isn't?” he replied. He 
looked up expectantly. 

“Then you are familiar with 
the disappearance of your Grand 
Champion over a year and a half 
ago?” 



H e looked me over from top 
to bottom before answering, 
then said excitedly, “Why, I 
believe you are he. Yes — you 
must be — ” 

His emotions bounced from my 
artificially maintained level to 
his interest and sincerity. 

“If you are indeed the Grand 
Champion of a year ago — you 
should know that your status is 
that of a free man. After your 
successful fight with Urut of Evvit 
and your escape from the arena 
you were declared free by the 
enthusiasm and will of all the 
people. How did you get here?” 

At one time I might have 
snarled and growled at this rep- 
resentative of their civilization. 
Now my mind froze as my con- 
scious portion became aware of 
my own lack of emotional 
response to him. I listened politely 
and rationally to his talk. My 
mind, though, buzzed with con- 
sternation. Was I wTong to hate 
Trevic Strenger so? Was their 

29 




world really all bad? Would I 
have been better off on the Planet 
of the Rocks, chasing rock wolves 
and fighting with others of the 
brood? 

Then, against all the instincts 
which make up a brood world 
barbarian, I freed the man and 
docilely followed him to his ship. 

The way back to Sabre planet 
was filled with wining and dining 
in the best of the patrol tradition. 
Word went out that the Grand 
Champion had survived shipwreck 
on a horribly inimical planet, and 
space for parsecs around was 
charged with the news. 

My fame had spread — and my 
prowess increased. I had been the 
Greatest of Grand Champions and 
had so been declared on official 
gladiator roles. And only Trevic 
Strenger knew my true status but 
even he was not certain how I 
bad come to be found on the 
forlorn Planet of Emotion. 



VIII 

W E WERE like two giant com- 
puters battling one another. 
Trevic Strenger knew that every 
move I made might lead inevitably 
to his death — for I still meant 
to keep my vow. I knew that 
anything he did might cause my 
destruction directly or indirectly. 
He held the power, the education 
and the experience. 

I was the Great Grand Cham- 



pion, beloved of the people and 
not entirely unused to facing the 
thought of daily danger. Urut of 
Ewit was now champion, for no 
ordinary one-G humanoid had 
been able to withstand his stam- 
ina, strength and speed once he 
had grown experienced in one-G 
conditions. Between Urut and 
myself the people gawked as only 
gawkers can. 

When I entered the gladiator 
stands, the gawkers stood and 
cheered for fifteen minutes. On 
the other side, far away from my 
grasping hands, Trevic Strenger 
sat surrounded by his sycophants 
and guards. Did I still wish him 
ill? I genuinely did not know. I 
knew only that I meant to kill 
him. 

Urut entered and the crowd 
applauded with enthusiasm. To- 
day was his show as well as mine. 
Then Trevic began his clever 
move against me. He arose, stilled 
the crowd, announced that it was 
only fitting that the newest and 
best of champions, Urut of Ewit, 
be challenged by the world’s Great 
Grand Champion. 

As he knew it would, the idea 
caught the gawkers’ imagination 
and they howled their approval. 
I was committed before my bar- 
baric wits could form a defensive 
reply. 

Only by sustaining the people’s 
good will could I be safe from 
Trevic and he had cleverly made 
use of the situation. I had to 



30 



IF 




fight. I flung off my civilized ac- 
couterments and leaped into the 
arena, no longer bound by chest 
band, free to enter and leave 
whenever I wished. 

I caught the tractor and pressor 
beams, tying them quickly to my 
ankles and wrists, and waited for 
Urut to move. He looked at me 
sadly from his heavy-lidded eyes 
and parrot-shaped mouth and I 
knew he had no desire for what 
he felt was sure to come. 



H IS first blow, with pressor, 
was light and I knew he was 
pulling his attack. As any other 
one-G gladiator would be, I was 
clumsy, slow and weak compared 
to Urut. I was also out of training. 
At any time he could have 
decapitated me or ripped my body 
to shreds, for his timing was per- 
fect. 

For purpose of show. I’m sure, 
he let me cartwheel him several 
times and the gawkers thought my 
response would soon build in 
duration and quality. I knew and 
he knew that we were mismatched 
and that he had the advantage. 
Survival on the Planet of Emotion 
had taught me that emotion, too, 
can be a club if only one knows 
how to generate it. I had much 
practice and while Urut had his 
will with me — now under tractor 
lock, then under pressor throw — I 
sought the key to the emotions 
in his humanoid bulk. 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



My endocrine system worked 
rapidly, generating pure emotions 
from apathy to grief, resentment 
to fear, boredom to happiness. 
None worked. I then tried com- 
binations as I had learned to do 
on the Planet of Emotions. Once 
I saw Urut falter briefly and pause 
to stare from glazed eyes. I 
thought then I had the key but 
lost the combination. 

My powerful physique was tir- 
ing fast. Urut had pressors on 
opposite sides of my body and 
tractors at right angles, on op- 
posite sides. I was being simul- 
taneously squeezed and pulled on 
different body sections. I could 
almost feel cartilage tear and 
muscle tissues pop. 

The gawkers were yelling for 
blood as I continued my search. 

I caught the emotional com- 
bination to his alien form and 
Urut paused again briefly. I drove 
my emotional wedge in and he 
faltered. He stumbled and fell to 
his chest as I slowly rose from 
the sand, giving every appearance 
of pushing back on pressors and 
pulling back from tractors still 
clinging to me. 

The gawkers screamed. 

As my body strengthened, my 
emotional output rose and Urut 
twitched in agony. I have no idea 
what the emotional content meant 
to his way of life; but it was 
a powerful antidote to his physical 
superiority. 

By the time I reached his side, 

31 




my body was fully recovered and, 
using every ounce of my two hun- 
dred pounds of muscle, I might 
have been able to decapitate him. 
I looked to the crowd and asked 
their pleasure and I thanked the 
great brood-God that nearly all 
screamed for his release. 

The gawkers yelled, stamped 
their feet and clapped their hands 
together. For them the solution 
had the appeal of a well-laid plot. 
How else could they have both 
their Great Grand Champion and 
the newest Champion to carry on 
with their future entertainment? 

T he day of Strenger's trap 
ended and I rested in my 
public-donated apartment that 
was lined with trophies of my 
earlier slave-status wins. Now, I 
thought, it was my turn against 
Strenger. My plan took form. 

During my planning stages and 
the impasse to follow the faulty 
educative process to which I had 
been subjected caused A. Zlinsky’s 
ph rase to repeat through my mind. 
It ran: “To the wise go words!” 
A meaningless utterance. I tried 
to suppress it. It wouldn’t go 
away, so I found myself trying 
to rationalize it. I did need a 
true and honest education to 
compete with Strenger — maybe 
that was what Zlinsky's silly 
quotation meant. I don’t know. 
But eventually it led me directly 
to more efficient and better 
organized educators. 

32 



The habit pattern my mind had 
developed of tracing all knowledge 
through quotations or simulated 
quotations whenever possible was 
disturbing. My new educators ex- 
plained that I would slowly lose 
the habit with time if I made 
a conscious effort to do so and 
that it arose from faulty use of 
the educator when I was a glad- 
iator trainee. 

Time passed. I became more 
acclimated to civilized behavior 
patterns. My emotional control 
was nearly perfect and I could 
more easily read the emotional 
patterns of others. Were it not 
for my vow against Strenger’s life, 
I might have learned to enjoy my 
new free status. 

When I was invited to attend 
the annual fealty procession and 
to serve as one of many state 
showpieces for public consump- 
tion, I could not help but suspect 
that Trevic Strenger’s next trap 
was ready. My own plan was 
shelved and I prepared myself to 
look for any opening, regardless 
of cost to myself. 

S INCE our procession was to 
approach Trevic Strenger’s 
seat within a matter of feet, I 
knew our day of confrontation 
had come and that I was being 
baited. He couldn’t know of my 
new ability to manipulate emo- 
tion, with which I would trap 
trapper. 

I took his challenge. On each 

IF 




leg and arm I attached secret 
pressor and tractor beams and 
joined the grand procession. 
Behind the others, I slowly ap- 
proached his position to give my 
symbol of fealty to the state. I 
could sense Trevic’s muscles 
tighten as I approached him. His 
emotions became snarled and bent 
by covert hostility. 

I grabbed his emotions by 
means of my new talents and 
twisted them down through grief 
and apathy. Downward they went 
until his face became placid, his 
arms and neck muscles relaxed 
and his whole stance presented 
a hopelessness. 

Only one person stood between 
Trevic and me and that one 
quickly left, urged on by another 
emotional impulse from my hulk- 
ing body. 

I faced Strenger as if he and 
I were alone in the world. His 
eyes seemed to plead and I scorn- 
ed him, for what power could 
this emotional invalid have over 
me? 

And then I knew that my hate 
for him was over and I dropped 
my long vow of hate and 
vengeance. 

Suddenly the floor dropped 
from under me. Instantly my 
reflexes snapped on tractors and 
pressors and I curved my body 
into the best stance to slow my 
fall. 

Slow it would not! Somewhere 
above me automatics caught and 

BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN 



sheared off my powers. No matter 
how I scrambled and twisted my 
body, the machinery kept up with 
my efforts, seeming to anticipate 
every one of my merely human 
emotions. 

The fall was not far. I landed 
catlike on all fours and bounded 
up to my feet again. Automatic 
machinery continued to nullify my 
pressors and tractors and steel 
bars surrounded me. Light came 
from the walls outside my new 
steel cage. 

I heard a door open in the 
outside wall and then Trevic 
Strenger's careful tread. He did 
not smile; neither did he frown. 
I reached forward with my emo- 
tions to engulf him in apathy 
again but he spoke quickly. 

“Turn off your machinery, bar- 
barian. Throw out your tractor 
and pressor beams, too. I ex- 
pected you to try for my life again 
and, as you can see, your attempt 
has not and cannot succeed. Face 
up to the fact that your machine- 
built education is only veneer- 
deep, your emotional control is 
uncivilized and your continuous 
attempts to kill me are more bar- 
baric than our gladiator’s arena. 
At least, there you know the 
rules.” 



1 THREW the pressor and tractors 
outward but remained silent. 
“That’s better,” he said. “At 
least you are intelligent enough 

33 




to know when you are captured. 
That’s more than I could say for 
you when I first caught you on 
your Planet of the Rocks. You 
fought until exhaustion then. Why 
not now?” 

I remained quiet but watchful. 
I read less emotional hatred in 
his voice and actions than before, 
perhaps because I projected less 
of my own thoughts into the si- 
tuation. 

“I don’t know what mutational 
talent you used to control my 
emotions to such a deep apathy 
before I triggered your fall into 
this chamber,” he continued, “but 
I can assure you, you are here 
to stay until this senseless hatred 
of me is gone or — as is most 
likely from your stubborn charac- 
ter — you die of old age. Which 
shall it be?” 

Unbidden to my mind came 
Farragut’s thought, “Damn the 
torpedoes! Go ahead!” I pushed 
it below my conscious level and 
spoke to Trevic for the first time 
since his capture of me. 

“I thought to kill you upstairs 
but then realized its futility just 
before your trap door opened. My 
hate has burned itself out.” 

He smiled and I noted how 
pleasant the smile was — not at 
all malevolent as I had believed 
for so long. 

“How can I believe your state- 
ment now?” he asked. 

“You have urged me to accept 
the civilization you represent. 

34 



What guarantee do I have that it 
consists of the advantages you 
have told me about?” 

“Try it,” he said instantly. 

“Then try me,” I also said 
instantly. 

He laughed at my answer and 
seemed to consider my request 
quite seriously. He reflected only 
minutes, however, then bravely 
motioned to his retainers. 

“Free him.” 

The bars around me rose and 
I faced Trevic Strenger, separated 
by only feet. I could easily have 
killed him at that moment. 

IX 

Y ears had passed since Trevic’s 
momentous decision to free 
me. Sitting at the helm of this 
tiny empire known as the Sabre 
planets I looked back with 
nostalgia at my innocent entrance 
into its society. 

Man had gone to the stars and 
returned, gone again. And those 
remaining at home had formed a 
weakened gene reservoir. Noting 
this state of affairs, man had 
returned the gladiator games to 
his home planet and then had 
forcibly invited back the barbaric 
and the humanoid — any muta- 
tional sports or freaks bearing new 
and untested genes were brought 
to Earth as gladiators. 

Here in the arena of strength, 
agility, intelligence and courage 
the long screening took place — its 

IF 




purpose to find new blood for 
the human race. Those freed, like 
myself, were the backbone of hu- 
manity’s new drive outward and 
inward. Slowly man returned his 
genetic protoplasm to an honored, 
aggressive, survival status. 

I’ll not forget the day of my 
final release from both the steel 
cell and my own inward-driven 
emotions. Trevic Strenger stood 
before me, bravely waiting for me 
to call his bluff — to kill him sud- 
denly or to accept his offer for 
civilized peace. He waited. Then 
suddenly he tore off his shirt and 
I could see the thickened keloids 
around his chest where his glad- 
iator band had once burned into 
him. 

Patricia Strenger, hair now 
grayed, skin wrinkled, figure long 
gone, sat by my side. She crushed 
my hand in thoughtful empathy 
as I looked down on the 
newcomer from far beyond the 



Sabre planets. His hatred of me 
was volatile and could have 
exploded at any moment, were 
it a gaseous compound. 

I could have dulled the edge 
of his emotions with my own 
freakish control over external 
emotions, of course, but this 
would also crush his spirit. Who 
knew? Perhaps the young bar- 
barian below me would be my 
replacement. I smiled at the 
thought, all the time knowing that 
he would interpret my brief flicker 
as a sneering grin of hatred. 

To my mind came unbidden 
phrases from quotes of our an- 
cient past and I had finally learn- 
ed to reconcile my thoughts to 
their contents. J. Christ had said, 
“And ye shall know the truth, 
and the truth shall make you 
free.” 

I signaled to have the snarling 
barbarian thrown into our ship 
and prepared myself for our long 
trek home. • 



BROOD WORLD BARBARIAN

R obert sat up slowly and cau- 
tiously on his bed in the 
white, quiet room. Like a mem- 
brane on the infinitely clean 
skeleton of his immediate universe 
the rumpled sheet relaxed across 
his legs, curving maternally 
around the mattress corners like 
the wings of a great albino bat. 
Shifting his eyes from side to side 

36 



with nervous prudence, Robert 
held himself still for an hour, then 
two, and three — he jumped in 
surprise when air happened to 
whistle through his own nostrils. 
Under the flaccid marble of his 
brow, morning thoughts continued 
to swarm from his two personali- 
ties. But he was always calm, so 
his walls were smooth, sans pads. 

IF 




“Oh, Tve been here a long time, 
and, oh, 1 haven’t moved in a 
long long time. I’d like to move, 
to straighten that wrinkle on this 
bed — grab that fly right out of 
this room’s sky. But let me tell 
you, if 1 started to do either of 
those things, Dad would warn me 
not to. It’s as simple as that. 
Dad's always around and he 
knows what 1 shouldn’t do, and 
he tells me. 

“Oh, if I stretched my arm and 
touched the fly. Dad would stretch 
his arm from wherever he is and 
touch my face. And the power 
of Dad’s slapping hand would be 
like my hand squashing that fly. 

“That woman with the tray of 
food — she calls herself a nurse 
and tells me that I'm in a 
hospital — but I must be at home 
if Dad's voice is here as it is 
all the time. Sec the tray and 
the nurse? I’d call to her right 
now but Dad would hear me and 
smack me. 

“Dad lets me eat breakfast, 
lunch and dinner. So I'm 
stretching out my hand and 
touching the tray. Dad lets me 
chew, too, and swallow, which 
I'm doing. 

“There is also pie on the tray. 
It smells good and — ’’ 

No, Bobby! That pie is sweet, 
bad for you, for your teeth. Bad 
for your veins, bad for your mind. 
Tve told you a thousand 
times — eat to live, don't live to 
eat. It says so in the Bible and 



Benjamin Franklin, great man of 
the United States of America, said 
so, too. No pie. Tell pie goodbye. 

“Goodbye, pie. See, Dad knows 
what 1 shouldn’t eat and he tells 
me what not to eat. If I had 
licked one bit of that lemon pie 
1 would have blood on my nose 
now or bmised red eheeks or 
purple eyes like those Dad always 
gives me when 1 do bad things.” 

Y ou ask me again what it was 
like back then. Before Robert. 
Mainly 1 was young, a researeher 
for Decade. I wrote my bit for 
the magazine but I was basically 
as unaware as anyone else in the 
nation. Do your really think my 
memory is worth anything? Okay, 
but it’s your ear that will suffer. 

P for Parapsychology and 
Pctrocelle. Let’s begin with the 
doctor, since he is credited — or 
blamed — for starting it all. 

Dr. Sebastian Pctrocelle led the 
invasion of the mental hospitals 
in 1997. As a persecuted member 
of the Defense Department he had 
the right and the obligation to 
do just that. In fact, it had been 
one of his own colleagues — the 
lone mystic found in the 
department — who had discovered 
that the mentally ill seemed to 
possess awesome powers in pre- 
cognition (called ESPerception), 
and telekinesis (ESConception), 
telepathy (both ESP and ESC?) 
ct para-cetera. 

When the initial report on the 

37 



AND SO SAY ALL OF US 




significant correlations was at last 
released, psychologists, psychia- 
trists and psychoanalysts around 
the world arose, wide-eyed and 
bushy-brained, seized the problem 
by the throat and wrote the 
equivalent of five thousand 
volumes of War and Peace in just 
one month after the discovery. 
Older doctors of the psyche who 
were reluctant to accept the fact 
of extrasensory perception and 
conception (ESPC) did miss the 
the boat and failed to adorn 
themselves with all those doc- 
torate degrees that went up for 
grabs because of the giant litter 
of possible thesis topics sired by 
the Discovery. 

Doctors willing to admit the 
existence of ESPC — with, of 
course, a scientist’s self-assurance 
that extrasensory merely involved 
some yet undiscovered sense that 
had its own easily comprehensible 
laws of order — embraced the cru- 
cial question: “Is the presence of 
extrasensory perception and con- 
ception in the metally ill the result 
or the cause of the mental 
illnesses?” 

Of the five thousand rambling 
nonfictive books written to answer 
that question, one thousand 
responded: “Illness is the cause.” 

One thousand claimed: “Illness 
is the result.” 

The remaining three thousand 
concluded in faddish anti-Black 
Box manner, “The two cannot 
be considered independently — no 

38 



clear-cut cause-effect relationship 
is evident.” 

Dr. Petrocelle did eventually 
read one of the five thousand 
Great World Articles written on 
the ESPC-mental illness sub- 
ject. That article happened to be 
the prototype of all of them and 
had been written by a colleague. 
Consistent with Petrocelle’s usual 
MO, his perusal of the article 
came twelve months after he led 
the invasion of the mental 
hospitals, twelve months after his 
grandiose faux pas with Robert 
Johnson. Petrocelle, having spilt 
the Defense Department's milk, 
was in a rest home when he finally 
got around to reading it. 

I N THE beginning, Petrocelle’s 
sole concern was for the power 
potential in the ESPC-mental 
illness correlation. 

“Power for progress,” he was 
known to say, “and progress in 
competion with the Enemy — who 
hasn’t always been the enemy but 
happens to be now.” 

Dr. Petrocelle received easy fi- 
nance for his search for the power 
potential simply because his usual 
skepticism about parapsychology 
and other occult fields was well 
known. His was also a skepticism 
recognized, respected, and 
matched by the feelings of men 
who doled Defense Department 
coin. 

“If our Dr. Petrocelle really 
sees something in this mental ill- 
ness-mental power stuff, then 

IF 




(here must be something to it.” 

Little did they know that was 
understatement. As it was, Dr. 
Pctrocelle was grasping for straws 
and could not truly chance being 
skeptical. His career in the De- 
fense Department was at stake. 

When questioned about the 
rather nebulous nature of 
parapsychology and his search for 
ESPC-fertile minds, Dr. Petrocelle 
said, “We are encouraged.” This 
meant that he and his colleagues 
hadn’t contributed significantly to 
National Defense for more than 
five years, that they feared, 
therefore, admissions of anything 
but optimism and that for 
personal survival's sake Petrocelle 
et al. were willing to try anything 
that verged on being science. 

As typical of frantic govern- 
ment antics, a machine was 
somehow thrown together, con- 
structed to test roughly for the 
presence of what the public now 
was terming “mind power.” 
Petrocelle and associates chose, 
instead, to call this power 
FA — for for titer animae — a fee- 
ble incorporation of an overly ro- 
mantic Latin phrase for adding 
dignity to their work — while at 
the same time they refrained from 
entering the Greek nomenclature 
tradition out of fear that a 
failure on their part would taint 
that wonderful medical language. 

The machine was called an 
electroFAgraph. 

Dr. Petrocelle was encouraged 

AND SO SAY ALL OF US 



as soon as his electroFAgraph 
discovered a Breton State mental 
patient with a sizzling FA poten- 
tial. At first Petrocelle remained 
uncertain about the degree of the 
power latent in the discovered pa- 
tient — but his uncertainty soon 
vanished when the final shock 
treatment prescribed for the pa- 
tient brought the poor man 
abruptly from his mental and 
physical immobility. Unfor- 
tunately the shock therapy only 
gave the patient motion — he still 
remained quite insane. A police- 
man had to shoot him to death 
when he used his FA to puncture 
a ten-foot hole in the hospital 
wall, hoping to escape. 

The officer shot him because, 
in the lawman’s own words, “He 
just wouldn’t stop coming.” And 
everyone did admit that the man 
in blue couldn’t have handled the 
FA maniac with his bare hands. 

Before the bullet punctured a 
much smaller but equally for- 
midable hole in his belly, the FA 
wielder spoke his not-soon-to-be- 
forgotten words: “1 must get 

away!” 

Everyone assumed this was a 
reference to hospital confinement. 

The policeman was not the sort 
of man who usually shot at mental 
patients. The variable factor this 
time was that all the plaster flying 
from the hospital wall reminded 
him of a grade-B movie he had 
once seen, called Earth versus the 
Mind Master — a film that had of- 



39 




fered a hot scene where a police- 
man was lucky enough to shoot 
the first seven-foot mind master 
that landed on Earth — lucky be- 
cause after that incident no human 
being was in any mental condition 
to shoot at anything. 

After the accidental execution 
of his prodigy Petrocelle grew 
cautious and more scientific. He 
snapped into action, brought more 
men to his side — allegedly for 
recording, experimenting, and 
learning but actually for verbal 
support of the doctor in case the 
FA venture didn’t progress fast 
enough for the government’s taste. 

At Adaja State mental hospital 
Dr. Petrocelle and the FA 
machine discovered a second pa- 
tient. His electroFAgraph sizzled 
in a nostalgically similar way 
to the late Breton State patient’s. 

tCoo you’ve given me the clini- 
i^cal report on Robert,” Pro- 
fessor Stapleton said. “But I don't 
understand how you’re going to 
cure his schizophrenia with my 
machine and on top of that get 
him to work for the government 
with his FA when he is cured. 
I’m a professor. Dr. Petrocelle, 
not a doctor or a government 
mind.” 

“1 know that. Stapleton. But 
you do know that machine of 
yours, and that’s all the reason 
I want you here.” 

Stapleton nodded doubtfully. 
“What we’re going to do,” Dr. 



Petrocelle continued, patting the 
teaching machine, “is crawl inside 
Robert’s mind. Instead of teaching 
a sleeping student with your 
influential voice, you're going to 
crawl inside Robert’s mind and 
you’re going to convince both 
sides of his mind — the father and 
son halves that render his whole 
being immobile and his FA only 
potential. Convince them that they 
should work together. Tell him 
that they agreed on things once 
upon a time and they should agree 
again forever. Robert will inter- 
pret your voice, Stapleton, as 
another father-voice, and his 
Bobby-son-voice will fuse with the 
critical father-voice he’s created 
for himself. Then when you pull 
out of his mind, you'll leave tlie 
father and son reconciled, happy 
together, and Robert will be able 
to move again and to utilize his 
FA. When he’s of one mind 
once more — pardon the ex- 
pression — he’ll be in our hands. 
What we must do is tell him that 
those disc-shaped wireless elec- 
trodes for the teaching machine 
are really just hearing aides so 
he can hear his father bet- 
ter — Bobby will put them on and 
give us no trouble. He’s never 
heard of a teaching machine and 
its apparatus before. Besides, he 
seems to be subnormal in in- 
telligence.” 

“How do you expect to get 
him to use his FA for the 
government? He might use it for 



40 



IF 




himself to become a criminal, you 
know. That’s what everyone has 
predicted for a situation like this.” 
“In the morass of words in 
that report you’re holding, it says 
Robert is both very religious and 
very patriotic — as his real father 
was. Unfortunately for Robert’s 
mental state — but fortunately for 
our goals — his father was also 
very strict. The patriotism, 
religious devotion and also the 
disciplinarianism of the father- 
voice in Robert’s mind will induce 
in the boy a fear of being un- 
patriotic — among other things. 
We should have no problems.” 
Stapleton looked a little pained, 
a little dubious. Dr. Petrocelle 
decided immediately on verbal 
anesthesia, his special talent. 

P ETROCELLE began: “Robert — 
motherless since he was seven 
— has always had a problem. His 
father was a paragon of discipline, 
matched only by the Inquisition 
with its brutality-for-a-higher- 
morality’s-sake. When very young, 
Robert grew accustomed to having 
his father criticize his every move 
with fiery words and physical 
abuse. Robert withdrew into 
himself, ceasing to function in any 
social way, barely eating, because 
even hidden in his own mind he 
could not escape the voice of his 
father. He’s not autistic or 
catatonic, technically, but he’s in 
a bad way. The habituation to 
criticism demanded that Robert 



fashion for himself a paternal 
gargoyle for his mind’s shoulder. 
The father-voice is very real to 
Robert, though it is only a 
manifestation ’ of his own 
generalized guilt feelings and con- 
ditioning. Unfortunately, or for- 
tunately — we haven’t yet de- 
cided which — Robert isn’t very 
smart. 

“There was a certain method to 
Robert’s father’s disciplinary 
madness but Robert, very young 
and not too intelligent, couldn’t 
discern it. Robert concluded sub- 
consciously that his father in an 
ideal state would criticize 
everything a son did. So the 
father-voice now attacks most 
every one of Robert’s motions or 
verbalizations. His survival 
instinct — to put it simply — forces 
Robert to believe his father 
wouldn’t criticize a son’s eating 
of the barest essentials — but 
sometimes the boy does nearly 
starve to death. Sometimes, 
though very infrequently, as when 
he is waking, he’ll speak words 
that express his omnipresent fear 
of his omnipotent and seemingly 
omnisagacious father.” 

Ears numb. Professor Stapleton 
muttered, “Dear God.” 

“So,” Petrocelle concluded, his 
voice bursting from its monotone, 
“1 want you, Stapleton, to get 
father and son together. Have a 
man to man talk with father and 
son. Okay?”

R obert blinked and shifted 
on the bed. His tailbone was 
feeling all tingly numb and he 
shifted again, then looked at his 
hands slowly. His temples were 
adorned with disc-like attach- 
ments. 

“Oh, I want to bite my finger- 
nail. Bite it with my teeth until 
it comes off like a crescent moon. 
But, oh, I know I shouldn’t, so 
ril be good and think of other 
things. The sun is nice through 
the window. But it makes my nose 
itch and I want to scratch it.” 
Boh, my son, scratching your 
nose is crass. It's bad manners. 
You could infect your nose, get 
it all red and puffy and look all 
diseased, too. You wouldn't want 
that would you? If you scratch 
your nose, you'll look like some 
urchin that hasn't had any up- 
bringing, so — 

bobby! ROBERT! BOB! 

“What is that? Someone calling 
me. And it^s not Dad.” 

If someone's calling you, Bob- 
by, don't listen! Don't just listen 
to any voice you hear. You can't 
always believe everything you 
hear. Listen to your father. 
Don't — 

bobby! bobby’s father! bob- 
by AND bobby’s dad, YOU SHOULD

A new voice was telling him 
things. 

Don't listen to the voice!

BOBBY. YOU ARE OF THE SAME

“Should I answer the voice? 
I think I’ll answer the voice.” 

*'No! The voice is of evil. 

“Why is the voice evil?” 

I'm NOT A VOICE OF EVIL. I AM 
THE VOICE OF GOOD, THE SPIRIT 
OF GOODNESS OF FATHER AND 
SON. 

“So the voice is good. Dad?” 

I don't know. Bob. The voice 
could be good or bad. 

“Should I move from the bed 
to open the window to let cool 
air in while I listen to the new 
voice, which told me to do as 
I want?” 

YES, OPEN THE WINDOW, BOB. 
YOUR FATHER WANTS YOU TO 
OPEN THE WINDOW, TO DO WHAT- 
EVER YOU WANT. YOU ARE STRONG 
AND A GOOD BOY, AND YOU HAVE A 
GREAT POWER TO HELP PEOPLE 
AND MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY BY 
DOING WHAT YOU WANT. OPEN 
THE WINDOW, IF YOU WANT TO. 

“Should I open the window?” 

IF 




DO WHAT YOU WANT, BOBBY. 
Yes, I guess you should do 
just exactly what you want to do, 
Bobby. 

D r. Petrocelle was excited. 

“Stapleton, did you see the 
way he finally decided to open 
that window? The crash of that 
window was a sound for sore ears. 
And he didn’t even touch it. He 
just sat on his bed and finally 
let go of his will to open that 
window, so hard that it actually 
slammed open. What FA!” 

“Yes, I saw it and heard it, 
too.” Stapleton was uncomfort- 
able in the presence of the doc- 
tor’s enthusiasm. He also felt 
guilty. “I’m glad we got out of 
his mind, though. A boy, just like 
a man, has a right to certain 
privacy of mind.” 

“Certainly, certainly. Robert 
will be working for us now.” Sud- 
denly Petrocelle’s enthusiasm 
waned slightly and he said, “I 
do wish you had said something 
to him about working for the na- 
tion, using his power for his 
country.” 

“I told him he had the power 
to help others.” 

“Yes, I know, but you should 
have said something about the 
nation. Well, anyway, he’s 
patriotic — his father was very 
patriotic. Robert’s been talking to 
everyone all morning — all the or- 
derlies and doctors — so we’ll be 
able to make our point about his 
country easily enough.” 

AND SO SAY ALL OF US 



R obert smiled, said “hello” 
loudly to himself and 
stretched, keeping eyes proudly on 
the window. The sheets felt cool 
and he stroked them hard for the 
first time ever. 

“Oh, that window went up with 
quite a noise, didn’t it?” 

Yes, Bob, it did. 

“The voice was right. I’ve got 
quite a power now.” 

Yes, a good power, Bob. 

“I wish, dear Dad, that I knew 
what the voice came for, where 
it came from, what it was. It 
was like a ghost — far-away 
sounding. But it made sense. 
Father and son. I love you, Dad, 
like a son should love his iather.” 
And I love you too, son. The 
ghost voice was good to come and 
talk and be with us — to make us 
understand what we should do, 
what you should do with your 
power. Whatever you want to do, 
isn't that right. Bob? 

Whatever you want, right? 

“Of course. I just wish I knew 
where the voice came from, what 
it was. I liked the voice. I’d like 
it to come back, you know.” 
rd like it to come back too. 
Bob. We both want it to come 
back and be with us. It made 
us feel good, didn't it. Bob? 

“Yes, it sure did. Maybe if we 
listened hard we could hear it 
again. Can you hear it?” 

I don't know. 

“I think I can hear it, barely.” 

/ think I can hear it. We both 

43 




love it and we want it to come 
back. I think I can hear it. 

“We can hear it.” 

Yes, I think we can hear it. 

CAN YOU HEAR ME? IVe COME 
BACK TO BE WITH YOU. THE 
THREE OF US NOW. CAN YOU HEAR 
ME? 

“Yes, we can hear you. But 
who are you, why are you here?” 

*'Yes, why are you here? 

LET ME THINK. I AM HERE. 
WHO AM I? WHY AM I HERE? LET 
ME THINK. 

“I will think about you, too.” 

Both of us, father and son, will 
think about you and why you're 
here and who you are. 

ALL THREE OF US WILL THINK 
ABOUT ME — ME, THE GHOST 
VOICE, THE GOOD VOICE THAT 
COMES TO FATHER AND SON AND 
SHOWS THE SON HE HAS A GREAT 
POWER TO HELP PEOPLE. LET 
US THINK. 

A S SOON as Stapleton and Pe- 
trocelle left Robert’s room, 
the boy shut the door and began 
staring through the window at the 
sky. Four steps from the door 
outside, Petrocelle stopped the 
professor. 

He asked, “What was he talking 
about? The ghost voice is back? 
I didn’t even get a chance to talk 
to him about it — he just kept 
talking so damn cryptically about 
the ghost voice.” 

Stapleton was angry. “He has 
imagined the teaching machine’s 



voice — my voice — has returned. 
We have compounded now his 
schizophrenia. He has three voices 
in his head now.” 

“Calm down. Nothing at all is 
wrong.” Petrocelle looked him in 
the eye. “He has the power and 
nothing is going to change that, 
because he’s happy now — he’s 
found an out, a way out of his 
frustration and misery from the 
critical father-voice. And he likes 
his FA power. The father-voice 
is all for that power now, too. The 
ghost voice he’s imagined won’t 
harm him. Now all we’ve got to 
do is talk to him about working 
for the defense of this nation.” 
“Can’t we just leave him alone 
with himself — with his new 

selves — for awhile. He looks so 
damn tired. He’s gone through a 
great change.” 

“We’ll give him a night by 
himself and talk to him in the 
morning. Government dragons 
will be breathing down my neck 
if I don’t get Robert moving on 
something productive soon. Ah, 
when they see him open windows 
as he can, kill flies as he can — ” 
Petrocelle was ecstatic. Staple- 
ton mumbled. 

H ospital nurses, guards, lo- 
cal police and, without a 
doubt, CIA, FBI and other rep- 
resentatives were scurrying around 
the hospital. It took Stapleton 
thirty minutes to find Dr. Petro- 
celle. 



IF 




The doctor was leaning over 
a desk telephone in the main 
hospital office, his face a dirty- 
sheet color and his eyes twitching 
with dark thoughts. 

“Robert’s gone,” Petrocelle 
said, the words slipping from limp 
lips. 

Stapleton sighed, shrugging his 
shoulders. “What did you expect? 
He was a boy on the move.” 

“We didn’t even get to talk 
about the nation and the country’s 
defense plans for the next ten 
years. His power was to be the 
main focus.” 

“He's a boy and he's just 
discovered a kind father and a 
new voice inside his head. Did you 
really think he’d stay inside the 
hospital when there’s a whole 
world outside he can voyage 
through — and when there’s his 
power, a great big toy he can 
play with?” 

“Good Lord, Stapleton — he’s a 
patriotic boy, isn’t he? He 
wouldn’t harm his own country, 
would he? His power is so 
great — ” 

“No, I don’t think he’ll hurt 
us. Tom Sawyer pranks at worst. 
Not unless you tried to stop him 
from going where he wants to. 
I’ll think he’ll be back soon. Even 
back to this place. You can talk 
with him then about the nation's 
defense. He’s not going to wreck 
anything — don’t worry. At least 
you can be confident he won’t 
go over to the other side.” Staple-

ton allowed a little sarcasm to 
show. “His fine religious and 
patriotic upbringing — or should I 
say conditioning — has made sure 
of that.” 

The professor left the doctor 
and returned to his teaching 
machine, which was crated and 
ready for the move back to the 
university. He was smiling and 
chuckling — for fear of crying. 

L ike the yellow eye of a Cy- 
clops, the sun blinked over- 
head and Robert continued walk- 
ing peacefully along the path. 

“I am the Son and I have the 
power to help people. There are 
six billion people on this earth 
and all of them have hurts in 
six billion different ways. I am 
the Son, with power. I have the 
power of good and I discovered 
who the ghost-voice is.” 

And you discovered who you 
really are, Son. We know now 
who the ghost-voice is and who 
I am. 

AND YOU, FATHER OF THE SON, 
DISCOVERED WHO YOU REALLY 
ARE. I AM THE GHOST AND WE 
ARE ONE AND THE SON HAS THE 
POWER. WE HOLY THREE. 

“I am moving and I am not 
going to stop moving until I can 
hear not just two but six billion 
voices. Until those six billion on 
this earth can hear my three 
voices.”

our shape at will, adapting to all 
conditions.” 

“This is very true.” 

“Even in this best of all possi- 
ble forms,” Jfaa 296 hurried on 
as he noticed Oyi 985 taking on 
the crenelations of the Adversary 
form, “how could we expect to 
live under the conditions of 
Thwth? The sky burns daily and 
twice as long. Being so close to 
the Primary, there are sharp dif- 
ferences from the light to full sha- 
dow. The constant change from 
true brightness to the dark con- 
trast would be dizzying. And, af- 
firmative, maddening. And, as if 
the heat of the day were not 
enough, if some poor life form 
got caught in the shadow — which 
is twice as long as ours — the drop 
of temperature would probably 
kill him on the spot.” 

“Perhaps they migrate to keep 
in the light. After all, the planet 
is smaller than Xhamllitt.” 

“That does not signify. The 
mass is different.” 

“All right. But certainly they 
have evolved in another form.” 
“Oyi Nine-eight-five, please 
negate that posture of Challenge. 
What other form could possibly 
survive? They would have to be 
formless such as we. They would 
require three sexes. And we have 
the advantage of a planet that 
revolves at a civilized pace so 
that we are never long without 
light. And we are at a respectable 
distance from the Primary.” 

THE POSTURE OF PROPHECY 



“In our studies there has been 
some debate about bodies with 
^ome type of framework.” 
“Framework?” Incredulity. 
“Tpri Seven-seven-one has sug- 
gested the possibility.” 

“Ah.” A twist of Recognition. 
“Tpri Seven-seven-one is the 
only Colleague who is doing 
creative and important thinking 
today. All the others are lost in 
a tangle of academics.” 

At this, Jfaa 296 extruded a 
second pseudopod and pulled 
himself to the full extent of 
Righteous Indignation. 

“And how could such a — a 
monster move? How would he 
keep his body from being crushed? 
Negative. That is the most 
ridiculous part of this life-on- 
Thwth nonsense.” 

“Then how do you explain the 
signals that have been picked up 
here?” 

“There must be many strange 
effects from radiation so close to 
the Primary. I think we can safely 
dismiss those as random at- 
mospheric conditions.” 

“But there was pattern and 
repetition to them.” 

“There is pattern in your mass 
fluctuation. There is repetition in 
the paths of our moons. There 
is regularity in our orbit.” 

“It’s just that — ” Oyi 985 
began to slide into Confusion. “It 
sounded so reasonable the way 
Tpri Seven-seven-one explained 
it.” 



47 




“Naturally,” Jfaa 296 went on, 
gathering himself into Maximum 
Paternal. “Tpri Seven-seven-one is 
a genius. But even genius can 
err. I commend his gift. I applaud 
his creative thinking. However, I 
leave it to those of us who have 
been instructed in the ways of 
logic to evaluate the worth of his 
work.” 

“How?” 

Jfaa 296 assumed a pose of 
Confidence. “We are better pre- 
pared. Ours is not the privilege 
of genius but the responsibility 
of knowledge.” 

“And you are convinced it is 
not possible?” 

“How can it be? Let us assume 
the pragmatic approach. The 
planet Thwth is only three from 
the Primary — far too close for 
survival. The atmosphere is a 
poisonous mass of nitrogen and 
oxygen with several other trace 
gases. It has vast seas of liquid 
ice formed of an oxygen-hydrogen 
compound and ambient vapors of 
this are always evident. Any 
natives would either boil or 
drown.” 

Oyi 985 was reluctant to con- 
cede the point. 

“Must they?” 

“Then consider the satellite. 
They've just the one — and that 
is so large that it must pull the 
seas around so violently that there 
are daily floods everywhere.” 

Oyi 985 Acquiesced. 

“Or take the radiation. I shud- 



der at the amount any poor 
inhabitant of Thwth would have 
to contend with. Why, under such 
bombardment there might be a 
dozen different species on the 
planet, assuming for the moment 
that life could exist at all. Think 
of the confusion that would cause. 
Imagine the problems in ecology. 
If you find just one other life 
form difficult to postulate — then 
what do you propose for the 
variety that would necessarily be 
part of that postulate?” 

“Til admit I hadn’t considered 
that.” 

“There could be as many as 
twenty sub-species. Nature is an 
orderly process as is demonstrated 
time and time again. There is a 
reason for all things. How could 
you find reason in the chaos that 
twenty different — different, Oyi 
Nine-eight-five — species would 
cause?” 

Jfaa 296 propelled himself for- 
ward in Emphasis. 

“Negative reaction. I am 
without defense.” 

And Oyi 985 flowed into De- 
feat. 

“There, there. You have been 
given the chance to understand 
and have done beautifully. But 
such an idea, when you look at 
it in the cool light of reason, 
defies that reason. It is disciplined 
minds, such as mine and yours, 
that will turn genius such as Tpri 
Seven-seven-one’s into the solid 
fact our science demands.” 



48 



IF 




“Should T denounce him, do 
you think?” 

“Negative. Of course not. Why, 
if it weren't for him you would 
never have given a moment's 
thought to the possibility of extra- 
Xhamllitt life.” 

“True enough,” said Oyi 985, 
looking a trifle Recovered. 

“You see, you have learned 
from this experience. There’s no 
point in behaving like Pgfd Three- 
twenty and his lot. They have 
been insisting that Tpri Seven- 
seven-one be banned from 
teaching because he has caused 
so much upset among the young.” 

“Well,” Oyi 985 allowed, 
“there has been a little trouble.” 

“But that unrest has turned 
many of you to deeper study than 
my generation has ever at- 
tempted.” 

In the posture of Embarrassed 
Acceptance of Praise, Oyi 985 
asked cautiously, “Do you think 
Pgfd Three-twenty will succeed?” 

“I doubt it.” Jfaa 296 assumed 
Contemplation and Wisdom. “As 
long as T am in charge of teaching 
the young on this planet nothing 
can go wrong.” 

Oyi 985 adjusted his ocular 
stalks and gazed rapturously at 
the horizon. 

“Even from an esthetic point 
of view, how could they live 
without the beauty of our rings? 
Think how dull their sky must 
be with just the one moon. Even 
if anything could live there, it 

POSTURE OF PROPHECY 



would have to be a dull, soulless 
thing. Obviously nothing there 
could have intelligence. Or art.” 
“Now you're thinking. You are 
intelligently considering things 
that Tpri Seven-seven-one has 
overlooked in his enthusiasm.” 
“Yet you must admit that his 
speculations are interesting.” 

Jfaa 296 jerked happily into 
Indulgent Humor, continuing, 
“They’re absolutely fascinating. 
But such ideas belong to that cult 
of Xhamllii who espouse the idea 
of interplanetary travel.” 

“I confess,” Oyi 985 admitted 
cautiously, “that I have read some 
of their scrivings. Not recently,” 
he amended hastily. 

“Ah, well, we all did in our 
youth, I suppose. Even I did. The 
scrivings were not nearly so 
sophisticated then but, still and 
all, delightful entertainment for 
the immature mind.” 

Jfaa 296 adjusted his body to 
allow the forming of a small Dent 
of Nostalgia. Oyi 985 adjusted 
himself to Acknowledgment. 

“They probably prompted me 
to consider a scientific career. 
They certainly increased my 
curiosity.” 

“Uhm?” the older Jfaa 296 
rumbled. “For that matter, those 
foolish scrivings got me started.” 
“But I’m beginning to realize 
how impossible it all is.” 

“That, my dear Qyi Nine-eight- 
five, is the trouble with growing 
up.” 

49 




They rubbed Nostalgia Dents 
and hummed in the Compan- 
ionship that a commonly mis- 
spent youth imparts. 

I T IS perhaps unfortunate that, 
just at the time of Jfaa 296's 
logical triumph, Earth launched 
its first manned Saturn probe 
which would make Jfaa 296 eat 
his words — even if he had to form 
teeth to do it. 

The day was a glorious one 
for Earth. The thirty-month probe 
was the first joint United States- 
Soviet Union project. The ship 
was crewed by one person from 
each of the two participating 
countries. 

As they passed beyond Mars, 
the captain, a thirty-three-year-old 
Marine test pilot from Boulder, 
Colorado, turned to his navigator- 
crew, a stunning brunette from 
Kazan with a command of English 
only slightly less dazzling than her 
smile. 

“You're what?" he asked. 

“I’m pregnant." 

“Are you sure?" 

She nodded triumphantly. 

“So much for those fusty old 
men back on Earth who said it 
couldn’t be done. We’ve been in 
space for three months and I'm 
going to have a baby." 

Quite a bit later, extracting 
themselves from a complicated 
free-fall embrace, he asked her 
what — according to her feminine 



intuition — she thought the baby 
was going to be. 

“Oh, I don’t care,’’ she said, 
turning lazily in his arms, “so 
long as it’s healthy." 

As far as it went she was to 
get her wish. But it was perhaps 
an unluckily accurate word. Just 
two months out from Earth when 
it was little , more than a few 
dividing cells, a random submi- 
croscopic particle that was blun- 
dering through the mother’s body 
had subtly altered the order of its 
incipient skeletal structure. For- 
tunately the radiation bombarding 
the ship’s fragile hull had played 
havoc with her blood or she would 
never have been able to nurse it. 

Even Oyi 985 would have been 
Outraged \yith the proud father's 
comment a few months later as 
he admired his wife’s swollen ab- 
domen. 

“There’s no life on Saturn now 
but we’re sure as hell gonna start 
some." 

His tone would have been con- 
siderably more apprehensive if he 
could have foreseen the quasi- 
tentacled, twenty-pound mass of 
amorphous flesh he was to cut 
from her dying body as they 
crossed Jupiter’s orbit. 

For Jfaa 296 was correct about 
Thwthian life in one particular. 
Unprotected from radiation by 
Earth’s atmosphere, unhampered 
by gravity, the child — or whatever 
it was in her womb — lived. 

And grew. •

E. CLAYTON McCARTY 



Both the man and the robot were 
old — and getting hard to take! 



R obot 678 had become a bit 
creaky about the joints dur- 
ing his long service with old 
Moondust Curtis. You could hear 
Six-seven-eight when he started 
from the kitchen. You could tell 
when he crossed the patio and 
detoured by the swimming pool. 
You knew exactly when he step- 
ped on the carpeting of the hall. 



No matter where you stood in 
the Big House you could follow 
his progress. The right knee joint 
emitted a distinctive creak. The 
left knee joint countered with a 
nerve-scraping screech pitched at 
about twelve thousand cycles. The 
elbow joints made a two-tone 
harmony as they swung, the left 
a diminished third based upon a 



51 





slightly off-tune middle C, the 
right an augmented third based 
upon A-flat below middle C. 
Syllabicated, they produced a sort 
of rhythmic hoowah-hoowoh, 
hoowali-lioowoli in the tempo of 
human arms swinging back and 
forth in contra-motion to the 
walking feet. As he approached, 
you also became aware of a con- 
stant low-key whirr of machinery 
deep within his chest — an uneven 
pulsating drone containing two 
alternating notes sounding like 
hrewer-ntniph, htewer-rumph. 

Old Man Curtis called him 
Cappy. In a dog-eared, Martian- 
huniming-fly-bcspecklcd, real Ve- 
nusian-drcamer-juice-stained Cata- 
logue, one that Moondust kept 
around somewhere in the Big 
House, Cappy was listed as R 
(for robot) 678. 

Included in the programming 
of his memory circuits was the 
manufacturer’s own sneaky little 
scheme. If, by some chance, you 
asked Cappy what you should call 
him, Cappy was triggered to 
answer, “I am Robot General 
Utility Servant, model R-Six- 
Seven-Eight. A duplicate of me 
may be purchased from any agen- 
cy of Happy Home Helpers, In- 
corporated, a licensed aitch-aitch- 
aitch representative on every 
inhabited world — or contact by 
space beam, code: Happy, 

Earthside twcnty-dash-bce-tvvo- 
six-dash-ten-four.” 

Robot 678 could not slate that 



this commercial was no longer 
valid. Happy Home Helpers, Inc., 
had allowed itself to stagnate dur- 
ing the forty years of his existence 
and had finally succumbed to 
younger and more competitive 
producers of servants whose soft, 
cosmetically perfect skin glowed 
with the pink of health and 
with a warm mockery of human 
life — and whose voices were 
capable of quarter-tone modula- 
tions in a range of three octaves. 
That information, obviously, was 
not in his circuits. So do men 
and machines lose touch with ac- 
celerating streams of evolution 
after they are tossed willy-nilly 
into its eddies. 

The catalogue had smelled of 
fresh printer’s ink when Robot 
678 came to live with Moondust. 
From its pages, gleaming with 
virginal purity, not yet stained by 
Venusian dreamer juice nor 
speckled with excreta of the Mar- 
tian humming fly, Moondust and 
his young Earthside 'bride had 
chosen R678 during the first year 
of their marriage, in the first 
month after Moon’s promotion to 
Assistant Administrator of Luna 
and after becoming certain that 
she would present her husband 
with an heir. 

An optimistic joy surroupded 
R678 until a husky son w^as 
born — who, in his journey from 
womb to world, killed his mother, 
thereby severing the zest for living 
from his father. 



52 



IF 




The baby was then shipped 
Earthside to the care of an aunt. 
Young Curtis stepped out of his 
promising career to wall off grief 
in a forty-year search for that 
fabled end of the rainbow, with 
R678 faithfully clumping along. 
Moondust prowled the interlands 
of Luna like any of the swarm 
of other dust rats, hunting for 
the big strike each of them hoped 
to find. But unlike most of the 
moondusters, perhaps because he 
did not care. Moon found his 
Eldorado — several of them — first 
on Luna and then, as those 
planets opened up, on Mars and 
Venus. And finally in a deposit 
of strangely glowing jewels out 
in the asteroid belt — which made 
his fortune one of the fabulous 
treasure accumulations of all time. 

For forty years R678 prowled 
the silences at the expanding edges 
of man’s domain in space, 
faithfully following his master. 
There were interludes during 
which Moondust would walk into 
some frontier saloon and sit 
morosely at a table with bottle 
and glass. Labels on the bottles 
changed through decades but their 
contents produced similar results. 
Robot 678 stood unmoving 
behind Moon’s chair. When the 
final glass tipped and spilled un- 
der fumbling fingers he picked up 
his comatose master and carried 
him to whatever lodgings had 
been engaged. There he stood 
quietly at Moondust’s bedside 



through the remainder of the 
night. And when the alcoholic 
sleep broke, he massaged his man 
and injected him with restoratives. 

Then inevitably Moondust 
would say, “Cappy, I’m getting 
mighty restless again. Let’s you 
and me take out.” 

The whirr within Cappy’s 
breast would become more pro- 
nounced as the proper response 
was searched from his memory 
banks. A couple of seconds later 
Cappy would answer, “As you 
wish, sir.” And within hours they 
would be off into space, following 
the beckon'mg phantoms of a 
galaxy’s buried treasure. 

Some time in their forty-first 
year, Moondust was out on a large 
asteroid, setting a small fission 
device to blast his way into some 
rock that looked promising. There 
was a premature explosion. It 
blew him clear but both his legs 
were mangled. Cappy applied 
bandages from remembered 
instructions stored during similar 
but less critical accidents. He then 
picked up his master in metalloy 
arms and strode off over the 
restricted horizon to their ship. 

By a miracle they made it 
through the vast darknesses be- 
tween the stars to Marsport, where 
the major space hospital was 
located. But both of Moon’s legs 
had to come off. 

That was when grafting of 
limbs was still a rather uncertain 
surgical problem and the doctors 



ROBOT 678 



53 




considered Curtis too old to take 
the risk. Of course there would 
be a set of clever artificial legs 
for him but Moondust saw the 
face of the coin chance had 
tossed — no more long lonely 
jaunts to the outer reaches, no 
more adventure-filled hours to 
keep a lid over grieving memories 
of his sweet young bride, 
memories as pain-filled as that 
hour when the birth cry of an 
arriving heir and the death cry 
of his mother had stirred the 
sterile hospital air simultaneously. 

When news of his double am- 
putation was chunked at him 
Moondust — still drunk from 
anesthetic- — mumbled, “Hear that, 
Cappy? I’m going to be a dad- 
blasted split-Venusian shummox- 
shucking invalid. You’re fixing to 
have to tote me around like a 
baby. Can those old scrap metal 
bones of yours take it? Or do 
I have you carted to the dump 
and buy some beautied-up imita- 
tion of a busty blonde amazon 
to do the job?” 

Speaking above the rising 
volume of noises in Cappy’s chest, 
the surgeon said heartily, “It is 
not as bad as that, Mr. Curtis. 
Prosthetics are almost as flexible 
as their human counterparts 
nowadays. You’ll walk with 
hardly a limp.” 

“Peglegs,” snorted Moondust. 

By this time R678 had found 
what seemed an appropriate 
answer to Moon’s question. His 

54 



speaker sizzled and his reply came 
in the statement form of the two 
inflections which had been built 
into his vocal mechanism. “I shall 
require more data to understand 
imitation of a busty blonde 
amazon, sir, before I can reach 
a conclusive answer.” 

Moon snapped, “Oh, go lay an 
egg, you pile of junk tin.” 

Cappy answered, “I have not 
been programmed for that par- 
ticular operation.” 

Moon shouted, “Don’t you 
answer me back, you iron-headed 
goony bird!” 

And the doctor said, “Pshaw 
now, Mister Curtis, don’t let a 
little thing like those legs upset 
you. You’ll hardly feel them.” 
“You bet your life I won’t,” 
Moon snorted. “There won’t be 
any nerves or flesh or blood in 
the damned things.” 

However, Moondust wobbled 
out of the hospital after a con- 
valescence remarkably short, his 
mind in the dark blue area of 
the soul’s spectrum. He moaned 
peevishly, “I can’t get the hang 
of these crazy metalloy legs, Cap- 
py. They aren’t going to carry 
me over anything rougher than 
a plasticon walkway. I’m nothing 
but a half-man now.” 

The nearest appropriate answer 
Cappy could find in his memory 
systems was, “That is undoubtedly 
true, sir.” 

And Moondust squalled, “You 
don’t have to rub it in, you pea- 

IF 




brained assembly-line welded 
conglomeration — ” 

Moon tacked to port and head- 
ed for the joy district, grimly 
determined to drown himself in 
Venusian dreamer juice. R678 
clumped along beside him, making 
the evening air melodious with 
his eek-hoowah-hoowoli brewer- 
rumph, yiku hoowah-hoowoh 
brewer-rumph — sweet harmonies 
of his joints and his continuing life 
processes. 

But Moondust discovered that 
dreamer juice would neither kill 
him nor hold back memory de- 
mons, no matter how protracted 
the binge. He came to that point 
where he could not think of the 
stuff without gagging. 

Then, after he had spent an 
hour staring through liquor-fuzzed 
eyes at a full glass, trying to coax 
inner reflexes out of their deter- 
mination to eject the bubbling 
blood-colored liquid the moment 
it reached them, he growled, 
“Blast your dod-rotted selenium 
soul, Cappy. Why don’t you stop 
me from making an ass of 
myself?” 

Through the familiar prelude of 
all the whirring brewer-rumph and 
crackling speaker Cappy quickly 
answered, “You have set a prob- 
lem which is impossible for me 
to solve, sir.” 

He picked up the wilting 
Moondust and walked out of the 
joy joint. 



I T WAS an old prospecting part- 
ner and friend, Jim Stanton — 
now a government commissioner 
of something or other in the 
Department of Planetary Ex- 
pansion — who had a remedy. The 
visiphone in Moondust’s lodgings 
chimed and Jim’s homely face 
came up on the screen. 

“I’ve been off planet and only 
just now heard about the accident. 
How's the ipvalid?” 

“Sick,” Moondust moaned. 
“There’s no prospecting left for 
me. I’m just a piece of a man, 
a planet-bound jail bird. I’m 
headed for the crazy house.” 
“Want a job to keep your mind 
off your troubles?” Jim asked. 

Moon shouted, “I couldn’t 
stomach being a fancy-pants did- 
dling around an office.” 

“Well, let me think about it 
anyway, you old dust rat,” Stan- 
ton shot back at him. “And in 
the meantime be careful not to 
bite yourself and die of 
hydrophobia.” 

And before Saturday noon 
(Earthside Greenwich), Com- 
missioner Jim Stanton had his old 
friend and the faithful 678 on a 
government star cruiser, headed 
out of the solar system. Moon 
had been invested with the title 
of Administrator, member of the 
sparse band of governors of 
Earth’s expanded frontiers. 

The planet entrusted to Moon- 
dust was almost literally at the 
end of time — a humid world, fresh 



ROBOT 678 



55 




from an era when the shallow 
seas completely covering its sur- 
face had once been shoved 
cataclysmically into more confin- 
ed beds by new mountain ranges 
and young continents. The cruiser 
plunked Administrator Curtis and 
R678 down on the only explored 
area. It was a triangular patch 
of fifty thousand or so square 
miles, fenced on its north by a 
two-hundred-mile lava dike which 
still steamed, and on each side 
by two huge rivers that rolled 
along, mightier than Earth’s 
Mississippi, toward a restless 
plankton-cluttered ocean. 

It was a beautiful spot if you 
liked the swamps and bayous of 
Louisiana, the moss-covered oaks 
of Mississippi and East Texas and 
the chiggers and moccasins and 
alligators of the whole Deep 
South, Earthside. 

Newly appointed Administrator 
Curtis looked at the land he would 
govern, sucked in heavy pollen- 
scented air, and crooned to his 
faithful servant, “Cappy, we’re 
home. I could just shut my eyes 
and imagine I was a little shaver 
waiting for my papy and mammy 
to come back from New Orleans, 
driving their spanking pair of 
matched blacks proud and happy 
and Old Uncle Tom setting in 
the back of the surrey, grinning 
like a slice of brown watermelon 
with white seeds. Cappy, just 
smell this air. I’m almost expect- 
ing to hear a steamboat whistling 
around the river bend any minute. 

56 



And listen to all the little bugs 
scritching in the woods.” 

R678 whirred a moment, then 
answered, “The olfactory im- 
pressions cannot be recorded. I 
shall keep a sensor trained upon 
the river bend. I am attempting 
to classify and record all vibration 
patterns of the scritching bugs, 
sir.” 

Administrator Curtis tore into 
his new job with all the excitement 
of a kid with a handful of light- 
ning bugs. The work was not mon- 
umnetal in its demands. Planet 
Sol Type Series XX-201, Sector 
711, was in a sense being kept 
on ice against the time when the 
fecundity of man should require 
its broad living room. Exploration 
and development of its unknown 
lands could proceed at a leisurely 
pace, in fact was not proceeding 
at all during the present decade, 
and Moondust there had no E. 
and D. men around underfoot to 
bother him. 

It was a toss-up whether the 
native inhabitants of the explored 
area should be classified as pre- 
stone age or post-ape age. They 
had to be handled like a band 
of educated chimps in a space 
lab. They possessed a language 
which seemed as substantial as' 
swamp shine, consisting of clicks, 
grunts, growls and gurgles, ac- 
companied by elaborate charades 
and posturings and an ever- 
present grin. 

The key to their communication 

IF 




had not yet been deciphered but 
there was a faded female with 
thick glasses and a Bryn Mawr 
air who spent her days among 
them with recorders and 
psychological gadgets, trying to 
break the code. Moondust found 
that she was quartered in Ad- 
ministration House, as was the 
balance of his staff, which con- 
sisted of a nervous, allergy- 
afflicted clerk of male persuasion 
and a Venusian cook who was 
neither, or both or either, 
whichever way you looked at the 
problem and whatever phase of 
the life cycle was uppermost. 
These formed the total non-native 
population of XX-201. 

Patchy surveys had shown the 
huge unexplored areas of XX-201 
to contain another type of 
primitive dweller, designated by 
some E. and D. man on the 
discovery crew as a Noddy. 
Nothing was known about the 
race, except that its members 
seemed to be able to change their 
shapes — revised thus from con- 
clusions of the first contacts which 
had noted a dozen different spe- 
cies. The Noddies smelled like 
skunk cabbages after a rain. 

This facility for changing shape 
was discovered by the only 
investigator in E. and D. to return 
alive from its second expedition 
across the big rivers. Later, other 
vaguely noted characteristics, not 
too clearly substantiated, filtered 
into the lore surrounding this sel- 

ROBOT 678 



dom-seen unique species. Mem- 
bers evidently mated as some 
Earth animals did. As her labor 
time approached, the female ate 
her mate. Each female ran to the 
hilltops at rutting season and 
howled until a band of males an- 
swered. The strongest and fastest 
got her. On moonlit nfghts, inhab- 
itants of the explored triangle 
could hear packs of young studs in 
screaming pursuit of females in 
heat. And when the chase circled 
to the river bank, a more grisly 
sound sometimes lifted above the 
banshee howls — the slurp of tribal 
jaws signifying that one of the 
pursuers had injured himself and 
was being devoured by his com- 
rades. The species was listed as 
dangerous. 

Fortunately, for some reason as 
yet undiscovered. Noddies could 
not seem to cross w^ater, a trait 
which probably saved the little 
settlement between XX-20rs big 
rivers, for no means had yet been 
found to kill them. The one sur- 
viving E. and D. member of that 
second expedition had written in 
his notes that both laser and ex- 
plosive projectiles just passed 
through a Noddy — any portion of 
its body that was struck simply 
dissolved around the penetrating 
force and flowed with the balance 
of the creature’s bulk into some 
new form. His was the only 
authentic account. No one else 
who might have gotten close 
enough to a Noddy to testify to

this report had ever returned from 
across the river. 

The tame natives in Moondust’s 
little triangular province, two 
small tribes, performed as laborers 
for the settlement, mechanically 
and zestfully, like trained dogs 
in a circus. You blew a horn 
at sunrise and they sprinted from 
their grass and mud huts and rac- 
ed for the corkroll fields. There 
they followed the same pattern 
day after day, tirelessly, with all 
the verve of a blind mule plodding 
a circle around a sugar cane grind- 
er back in the Old South, 
Earthside, circa eighteen hundred 
something — cultivating corkroll, 

Which actually rather resembled 
Earthside cane, except that its sap 
was dried and powdered and 
shipped to Earth pharmaceutical 
companies to form the basic 
ingredient of a miracle drug which 
had added almost a hundred years 
to man’s life. 

And the natives’ quick fingers 
and steadily chomping jaws were 
much more effective than any 
insecticide that could be devised 
for the tender corkroll plants. 

At sundown you blew the horn 
once more and they scattered, like 
chickens running from a hawk, 
into the woods to hunt swamp 
fleas and crack them to suck out 
their juices, or to paddle down 
under the black bayou waters, 
scrounging for frogs and snails 
and snakes to pop into their 
mouths. Nobody from Cultural 

58 



Affairs Department, Earthside, 
had yet been able to interest them 
in setting a formal table. 

These far from arduous duties 
thus left Administrator Curtis with 
plenty of time to stroll out to the 
hickory grove that shaded the hog 
hollow — except that the hickories 
were scaly-barked Bronta trees 
bearing iron-hard seeds in a 
chestnut type burr which at ripen- 
ing time squirted them out with 
the range and velocity of shotgun 
pellets. And the hogs were nonex- 
istent — the place merely bore a 
resemblance to the old home 
hollow. Moondust strolled there 
or sat upon the dewy grass in 
perpetual June-time weather and 
floated back on memory’s drift. 

R678 stood patiently behind 
Moondust, recording in his 
memory circuits every word the 
old man spoke and every sniff 
he took of the balmy air, offering 
a shoulder to support him when 
moist midday heat drove him in- 
doors. Cappy fanned him through 
the steaming afternoon, woke him 
from his nap when the hour came 
to blow the horn and send native 
plantation hands scampering off 
on their frenetic food hunt. It was 
like putting raw whiskey away in 
charred oak barrels. Moondust 
mellowed. 

T he mellowing first assumed 
the form of an attempt to 
duplicate his by now exaggerated 
memories of the old plantation. 



IF 




He took 678 out where a long 
grassy slope tilted toward the river 
and said, “Cappy, pry into this 
blasted thick skull of mine and 
get a clear picture of just what 
Tve been dreaming about. Then 
design me a real honest-to- 
goodness Louisiana plantation 
house that’ll fit right on top of 
that knob.” 

The robot replied, “As you 
wish, sir.” It adjusted sensors to 
make contact with the master’s 
head. 

Moondust said, “Now I’ll just 
sit down right here and fix my 
eyeballs on the river and I’ll say 
to myself ‘Good old Mississippi.’ 
I’ll start thinking about that house 
so hard you won’t have any trou- 
ble catching just what I want. 
And mind you, Cappy, don’t make 
one little smidgin of that house 
any different from the way I’m 
seeing it in my mind or I’ll build 
a bonfire and melt you down to 
a cinder. I want me a real old 
mansion.” 

“As you wish, sir,” answered 
678. 

And silence settled while 
Moondust concentrated and Cap- 
py recorded brain waves — silence 
except for the brewer-rumph in 
Cappy’s ehest and the chittering 
of a million insects and the ulula- 
tion of a Screaming Slug Eater 
and the moaning of several 
macaw-like flying things, the siz- 
zling of swamp worms, plash of 
river and whisper of breezes.

Construction presented no prob- 
lem. Moon’s limitless fortune 
brought space freighter, con- 
tractors, architects and an army 
of robot artisans to XX-201. The 
problems arose from a tempera- 
mental melee which blew up be- 
tween the highly paid architects 
and Administrator Curtis over his 
insistence that 678’s plans be ex- 
ecuted down to their last detail, 
exactly as drawn. 

Violent tantrums got the 

architects nowhere, nor did 

derision. There was no way for 
them to ease their ulcers by walk- 
ing off the job. When you’re stuck 
on a distant planet, you’re stuck. 
So a rambunctious compromise 
resulted after 678, on command, 
had brought them all tenderly, two 
at a time, one under each arm, 
and set them gently in a row 
of chairs facing Moon. So the 
mansion took form. 

It had the wide wind-swept 
porches and tall white columns, 
the gracious entrance hall and 
sweeping staircase of ante-bellum 
plantation showplaces. But senti- 
mental remembrances of one’s 
childhood are apt to become con- 
fused with more recent im- 
pressions over a half-century span. 
Beyond the great stairway came 
Moorish arches, Byzantine in- 
crustations, Japanese prayer lan- 
terns, Chinese pagoda, Spanish 
patio, moon-base dome and a 
Hollywood swimming pool, all 
tied together. 



59 




Then the space freighter lifted, 
taking with it the artisans and 
architects, leaving behind to keep 
Administrator Curtis company 
only the female Bryn Mawr type, 
the male allergic clerk and the 
uncommitted Venusian cook. 

The next phase of mellowing 
in the charred wood of the barrel 
settled upon Moondust. He rub- 
bed his hands together, snapped 
his fingers and said, “By Gadfry, 
Cappy, weTe alone again.” 

R678’s circuits buzzed a bit. 

He eventually replied, “The 
definition of alone must be 
altered, sir, or some other 
descriptive symbol used.” 

“Now just you don’t bother 
your tin head about that, Cappy. 
What I’m after is for you to tote 
me a rocking chair out on this 
veranda and fetch me a big tall 
cold julep.” 

R678’s speaker rumbled, “As 
you wish, sir.” 

And he went Eek hoowah- 
hoowoh brewer-rumph, yiku 
hoowah-hoowoh brewer-rumpli 
to the kitchen. 

Administrator Curtis found that 
only a smidgin of imagination was 
required to transport him back 
to the old home place to rock 
on a shady porch of the Big 
House, with scented breezes stir- 
ring stray locks of white hair and 
a julep ever waiting at his elbow. 

Although the imitation skin of 
678 was not black, its texture 
and hue of weathered chamois did 



fit the picture to some degree. 
And the robot could mix a julep 
worthy of its prototypes, with 
ingredients much more exotic than 
its ancestors, including a sprig of 
plueil, which was not only more 
tangy than mint but left one in 
a heavenly state of euphoria. 

The cicadas and lightning bugs 
were missing and the coughing 
snort of XX-201’s swamp lizards 
bore no real resemblance to that 
full-throated roar of the good old 
green bullfrog giants of Mississip- 
pi’s river bottoms. And no haunt- 
ing harmonies drifted from cabins 
of the field hands. But heavy 
flower-scented air drifted thickly 
after sundown and one could 
dream quite effectively with eyes 
closed, so that the thick, three- 
foot fronds of Bronta trees did 
not destroy images of oaks and 
magnolias hanging over oleanders 
and calycanthus — that is, unless 
a flock of rock chickens happened 
to be foraging in the area. Their 
nasty chuckles and cat-calls, as 
well as a certain post-digestive 
habit, could destroy any reverie. 

Then Moondust went through 
another mellowing stage. 

One twilight redolently damp 
with dew upon the meadow and 
a scent of mud grass heavier than 
a dowager’s cosmetics and the 
rock chicken flocks far enough 
away so that their lewd noises 
could be ignored. Old Man Curtis 
suddenly said, “Cappy, I’ve got 
a son somewhere in this far-flung 

IF

gaggle of stars and I bet he’s 
feeling plumb low because his 
pappy never did right by him. 
We're just fixing to find that little 
boy and make up to him for rac- 
ing around this here galaxy petting 
up our own sorry feelings and 
letting him get spoiled by some 
female relation. Go get me Henry 
Riitenhauser.” 

R678 eek~yikued over to Ad- 
ministration House to fetch the 
allergic clerk. So Henry, under 
instructions, poured a bucketful 
of Moondust’s wealth into the 
pockets of a detective agency. The 
dicks were efficient. They found 
the son’s grave, the son’s widow 
and his twins, a boy and a girl. 

“That’s no more than 1 deserve 
for negleeting the poor boy,” 
Moon moaned to the clerk. And 
to the robot he said, “If you ever 
get any kids, Cappy, don't you 
be a dod-swizzled fool like me 
and let them get away from you.” 

Through a slightly uneven 
brewer-rumph Cappy stated, “The 
R Six-seven-eight model was not 
designed with the ability to re- 
produce, sir.” 

• “Don’t tell me things I already 
know, you dag-nabbed rusty junk 
pile,” growled his master, “I was 
talking to myself. Reckon the best 
way to make it up to my poor 
dead boy is to bring his pretty 
young widow and his two babies 
here to live with me.” He turned 
to the clerk. “Henry, you get busy 
on that little old thing.” 

ROBOT 678 



Jt would have done no good 
to remind Moondust then that 
inexorable time had probably 
helped the young widow to skate 
toward forty and that the twins 
must be babies of at least nine 
summers. In his mellow role of 
plantation colonel, with a rosy 
filter censoring any rays that 
might have played white light over 
his imaginative excursions, Moon 
was destined to wait and receive 
such news with shock when a star- 
ship's shuttle dropped the little 
family off on XX-201. 

The widow turned out to be 
a pale-eyed blonde instead of 
Moondust’s romanticized picture 
of a small dark-haired beauty 
scarcely out of her teens, whose 
brown eyes glowed with warm 
sentiment — his own portrait un- 
consciously influenced by age- 
misted memories of the only other 
woman in his life. But Moon 
could adjust. The widow’s sharp- 
nosed appearance he could blame 
on no one but her ancestors. 
Marking her with the name Tcena 
was the fault of her parents. Moon 
had too little experience with 
civilized ways to determine 
whether Tecna's silvered yellow 
hair was the product of genes or 
industrial chemistry. But the chil- 
dren had the look of his dead 
son, even though they were older 
than he pictured. 

They sidled toward him, 
responding to nudging from 
Tcena. The girl curtsied; the boy 



61 




offered his hand. And both said 
politely, “How do you do, 
Grandfather?” And their mother 
followed them and touched her 
lips briefly to Moon's wrinkled 
cheek. 

Then they all looked at each 
other until Moon gestured toward 
the landscape and said, “Well, 
how do you like it?'’ 

Teena stared at the terrain. 
“There isn't much here, is there? ' 
And the children asked, “Where's 
the city?'’ 

Moondust explained that this 
was an undeveloped planet but 
very comfortable and full of great 
promise for the future. Teena 
assured him that she didn’t mind, 
that she and the children were 
deeply indebted to Grandfather. 

“We'll miss the stimulation and 
conveniences of city life but 
pleasure costs too much for a 
widow with only a few credits 
in the bank. I wouldn't care for 
myself but I want good things 
for the children. We can't thank 
you enough for asking us to come 
live with you.” 

The twins' butterfly minds had 
darted to things more interesting 
than politenesses. Jill tugged hard 
at her grandfather and pointed 
to 678. 

Bill cried, “That’s a funny 
robot — ” 

Jill asked, “Does it belong to 
you?” “Why doesn't its face look 
like a face?'* Bill finished. 

•*That's Cappy,'* Curtis told 



them and put a hand on the 
robot's metal shoulder. “These are 
Billy and Jill, Cappy. And Teena, 
I want you and Cappy to be ac- 
quainted. He’ll take real good care 
of you all. Cappy and T have 
been friends for years." 

The twins went into a fit of 
giggles at the rising hrewer-rumph. 
as 678 spoke in his statement 
inflection, “I have been instructed 
to serve Billy and Jill and Madam 
faithfully." 

Teena said, “It's certainly an 
old relic. I suppose on worlds 
like this you can't find anything 
better." 

Billy added, “Back on Earth 
robots look like people." 

Jill giggled. 

“And they don't talk funny.” 

A rousing welcome banquet 
awaited the new family of Ad- 
ministrator Curtis. No shining 
carriages discharged southern 
belles and courtly gentlemen at 
the portico but the company did 
its best to make up this lack by 
animation. Henry Rutenhauser 
was there, well shaven, with 
allergy under temporary control 
and two new jokes picked off the 
space waves. The Bryn Mawr type 
lent dignity with discourses upon 
the aspirated whisde and nose- 
damped hoot of the natives. Of- 
ficers of a freighter, down for 
their midseason consignments of 
powdered corkroll, were glad of 
an opportunity for dining on un- 
concentrated food. 



62 



IF 




All stuffed themselves with 
beaten biscuits from real 
Earthside wheat flour and the 
Venusian cook had whomped up 
a reasonable facsimile of southern 
fried chicken from a scaly flying 
creature called by the natives a 
swsss, accompanied by patting of 
midriffs and flapping of arms. 
Crystals impregnated with ancient 
Stephen Foster melodies disgorged 
home-sick sweetness through the 
stereo horns and 678 eek-yi kneel 
through butler routines ac- 
ceptably. 

^ II 

T he trouble between the 
twin's mother and 678 bare- 
ly waited twenty-four hours later 
before erupting. Curtis heard 
Teena shrieking in the Spanish 
patio. He clumped back there as 
fast as his prosthetics would carry 
him and found his robot backing 
toward the Hollywood pool while 
the blonde daughter-in-law threw 
chair cushions and julep glasses 
and end tables at the metal man. 

“Get away from me, you thing! 
You nightmare! I can't stand that 
squeaking of yours. Get out!” 
Henry Rutenhauser held her 
hand, trying to comfort Teena. 

He led her to a lounge, croon- 
ing, “There now. Don't. let it upset 
you. 1 can't understand why the 
Administrator keeps a nightmare 
like that but some men get a 

ROBOT 678 



little batty with age, you know?” 

Moondust whispered, “Cappy, 
you’d better go on out front.” 
And to the clerk he said with 
exaggerated mildness, “Henry, I’m 
not batty enough to forget there’s 
an office full of manifests to work 
up so that freighter can lift off on 
time. Maybe you’d better go,” 

Henry went — fast. 

Moon limped to his daughter- 
in-law and sat beside her. 

“You don't need to be so upset 
with Cappy. Just tell him what 
you want and he’ll do it.” 

She dabbed her eyes. “He’s like 
a scarecrow. He grates on my 
nerves. When I try to take a nap 
that thing's squeaks wake me up. 
Tm a sensitive person. I can't 
stand shrill noises.” 

“You just keep remembering 
Cappy has a heart of gold,” Moon 
said. 

“That blank face makes me ill,” 
Teena said. 

“You'll get used to him,” Moon 
said firmly. 

Teena w^aited, “With all your 
money — I can't understand why 
you don’t junk the monster and 
buy some of the new miracle 
robots.” 

“Why, I couldn't do that. Cap- 
py’s like a big brother to me. 
Why, Td die before I did anything 
to hurt Cappy's feelings. You 
wouldn't want me to put Cappy 
out of his own house, would 
you?” 

Teena ran out sniffling. 



63 




Only a week after this Moon- 
dust found Teena in his special 
rocking chair on the north veran- 
da. Slie gave her pouting smile 
and started to rise, sighing mar- 
tyrishly. 

[ Moon protested: “Now don't 
you get up." 

^ He eased himself down on the 
porch and leaned against a pillar 
to enjoy harp sounds a breeze 
played in Bronta fronds, the bub- 
bling, whistling, far-off chit-chat 
of natives in the corkroll fields 
and the calls of fauna in the 
swamp lands as they gaily gobbled 
each other for lunch. 

I Moondust waved a languid paw 
and yawned. “Listen to all those 
little things. Makes the air 
downright peaceable." 

i The forced smile again touched 
Teena, with a pucker to her un- 
derlip that Curtis decided must 
have made her look sort of cute 
in the first bloom of girlhood. 

And thafs when my son 
courted her. 

1 He could imagine how his boy 
might have found her intriguing 
and blamed himself anew for not 
sticking by his boy to educate 
him about women. 

But Tecna's voice was fretful. 
“It’s lonely here. We had lots of 
people around us all the time back 
on Earth to keep life exciting. 
And visiscreens to pass the time. 
Even if we were so poor we didn’t 
know where the next meal was 
coming from.” 

(A 



“You’re hankering to go back 
there?" 

“Oh, no. Til endure any kind 
of hardship to make life easy for 
my children." She stopped rocking 
and puckered her lip again. 
“Maybe if we had some servants 
that looked like real people and 
talked like them 1 wouldn’t be 
so lonesome." 

“Oh, we don't need extra help. 
Missy," the old man answered 
amiably. “Cappy can take care 
of all of us." He watched clouds 
cover his daughter-in-law's face 
and twist her mouth and shook 
his head sadly. “I’m sorry you’ve 
taken out a hate on Cappy. I 
want the mother of my boy's chil- 
dren to be happy." 

“Then get servants that look 
like people and talk like people." 

“That kind are a mighty far 
piece from this planet and we 
won’t be having another ship 
touch down until Spring." 

“Henry says there are some 
down in the warehouse." 

“You been talking to my clerk 
about this?" 

She pouted. “Henry’s very un- 
derstanding. But he has his work 
and he can’t be around all the 
time to talk to." 

Moon muttered, “He'd better 
not." 

“Henry says there’s a whole 
retinue of house servants in their 
original boxes stored there. All 
we have to do is activate them. 
He says they are the latest models. 

IF 





You can’t tell them from real 
people, even when you touch 
them.” 

Moon sighed. “Well, Missy, I 
reckon it would be more peaceful 
for us all to give in to you. Til 
just mosey down and set Henry 
to breaking those boxes open this 
afternoon.” 

“And then we could get rid 

ROBOT 678 



of that horrible-looking old robot 
that follows you around.” 

“Get rid of Gappy? No, ma’am. 
Gappy’s my friend. Gappy’s saved 
my life more times than you have 
fingers and toes.” 

She started to sniffle. “I won’t 
endure it. He scares me. I can’t 
eat for watching him.” 

Moon shook his head sadly. 

65 



“Fm sorry, Missy. I couldn’t look 
Cappy in the eye if 1 was thinking 
of doing him in. He’s got a right 
to live, same as you and I.” 

“But he’s just a robot. He’s 
not a person.” 

Moon said positively, “No, 
ma’am.” 

“That imitation skin is full of 
moth-eaten patches. It disgusts 
me. 

“Then you'll just have to look 
somewhere else.” 

Teena had sense enough to 
recognize the determination in 
Moondust’s voice. She took her 
pouting elsewhere and hunted up 
Henry Rutenhauser for consola- 
tion. 

Put Eve into an Eden and she 
does not need an apple or a ser- 
pent. A squeaky robot and an 
allergic clerk will do. 

Together, Teena and Henry 
planned a strategic campaign. Af- 
ter the new servants had been 
on the job a few days, Teena 
began hinting, finally asking 
Moon outright, “Don’t you just 
love the way our new servants 
keep the house?” 

And Henry added casually at 
other times, “Good thing we had 
a retinue of robot house servants 
in stock, sir. They’re remarkably 
efficient. It’s a joy to watch them 
work.” 

And Teena, as if in af- 
terthought: “They’re so efficient 
that they leave absolutely nothing 
for that mouldy old robot to do. 



And they talk like real people.” 

“That's right nice,” Moon told 
her the first few times. “Cappy 
don’t mind letting your pretty 
dolls do the housekeeping. Cappy 
deseiA^es to take life easy. He’s 
got old and creaky like he is by 
keeping me out of trouble, and 
any man that’s done his duty in 
this galaxy ought to have a long 
easy-going old age. You keep your 
dolls out of Cappy’s way and off 
my veranda so I won’t have to 
listen to their jabbering and they 
can work all they want to.” 

Then Eve chose her Adam. 
Moondust heard it from the chil- 
dren first. 

“We’re going to have a new 
father,” Jill burbled. 

Teena admitted that she and 
Henry had decided upon marriage. 

Old Moondust complained to 
678 at the edge of the corkroU 
fields where he felt safe from in- 
quisitive ears. “Cappy, I just can’t 
make out what she sees in that 
nose-blowing diddler after being 
married to my son. Can you? But 
I also can’t figure out what kind 
of a prize my boy thought she 
was.” 

From the midst of the brewer- 
rumph exertion 678 replied, 
“More data required before an 
answer to your question can be 
formulated.” 

“I didn’t ask any questions, you 
blasted chatterbox. I just remark- 
ed to myself that if your squeak- 
ing sends her into a tizzy, then 

IF 



66 




Ill 



I don’t see how Henry’s eternal 
sniffing wouldn’t give her a con- 
niption fit.” 

“Squeaks and sniffs are not 
synonymous,” Cappy answered. 

Moondust behaved like the in- 
dulgent, plueil-mellowed southern 
colonel he had built in imagina- 
tion. He gave the bride away and 
stirred up the gayest wedding 
supper that could be arranged 
with one guest, Bryn Mawr type. 
The marriage was performed via 
the space beam by the Space 
Academy chaplain far off on 
Mars, and the groom movechihto 
Teena’s quarters in the Big House. 

And Henry began to expand, 
gradually changing his manner of 
addressing Administrator Curtis, 
abandoning the subservient “sir” 
for a patronizing “grandfather.” 

Moon enlightened him quickly 
on that point. “I am not your 
grandpappy and I never hope to 
be. Let’s straighten out our little 
old relationship in a big hurry, 
Henry.” 

The clerk said, with a lift of 
an eyebrow, “Happy to oblige 
you. I assumed that using 
‘grandfather’ would make things 
less confusing for the children. 
I had forgotten that you might 
be a little bit sensitive about your 
age.”^ 

“It’s not the age, Henry Ru- 
tenhauser. It’s your claiming to 
be related in a way you just don’t 
have any dag-swizzled right to 
be.” 



N OTHWiTHSTANDiNG the atti- 
tude of the parents, 678 was 
no anathema to the children. They 
were constantly with the robot, 
each holding tightly to a metalloy 
hand from which the imitation 
skin was shredding. Under Cap- 
py’s guidance they explored the 
plantation, chattering like Martian 
Jabber Birds. Out in the corkroll 
fields they giggled at the 
monkeylike movements of natives 
and Jill hid her face against the 
robot’s hard side each time she 
saw workers snatch wriggling, 
many-legged black things from the 
plants and pop them into their 
mouths. 

Where the last grassy slope slid 
toward the swamp the children 
tugged hard, trying to coax the 
stubborn metal man farther into 
black tunnels of fernlike thickets 
where vines writhed when touched 
and made soft plopping noises. 

“I want to find out what’s doing 
that zing sound,” Billy urged. 

“It is forbidden to take you 
into the swamp,” Cappy's state- 
ment inflection rattled over the 
hrewer-rianph, “The zing is the 
feeding song of a sizzling swamp 
worm.” 

“I want to see it.” 

And Jill begged, “Come on, 
Cappy.” 

“The sting of the swamp worm 
is fatal. We shall go to the Big 
House instead.” 



ROBOT 678 



67 




Their feeble fingers could not 
break the robot's iron grip, gentle 
though it was. They went to the 
Big House, fussing like two flies 
stuck to a piece of tanglefoot. 

“Let’s go for a boat ride on 
the river then,” Billy pleaded. 

“It is forbidden to take you 
on the river,” rumbled Six Seven 
Eight’s speaker. 

They soon found Administrator 
Curtis in his porch rocker. 

“Why can’t we have a boat 
ride?” the twins asked together. 
“Please, Grandfather?” 

Moondust shook his head. “The 
current could sweep you too close 
to the other bank and Noddies 
hang from tree limbs out over 
the water, waiting for things to 
float past.” 

“What the devil is a Noddy, 
Grandfather?” And Jill chimed in 
with, “Are they animals?” 

“Nobody’s sure what they are,” 
the old man muttered. “You don’t 
know whether they’re around or 
what they’re going to look like 
until one of the dad-blasted 
thingumbobs starts for you.” 
“Oh!” Jill cried, big-eyed, and 
Billy asked, “Do they eat you?” 
Moondust said, “Reckon they 
do. Many’s the field hand that’s 
swum too far under water looking 
for water worms and come up 
right under a tree limb hanging 
low over the river, right in the 
claws of a Noddy that was there 
waiting for him. The Noddies drag 
them off into those mountains 



across the river — and that’s the 
last you ever see of the native 
fools.” 

Billy had a logical mind, keen 
for a nine-year-old. “Why don’t 
those Noddies swim over here and 
kill people on this side of the 
river?” 

“Because their constitutions 
can’t stand soaking in water.” 

“What’s constitutions?” asked 
Jill. 

“It’s their innards,” Moon 
replied. 

“What do Noddies look like?” 
Billy asked. 

“Like almost anything they take 
a notion to. Sometimes it’s a rock; 
like as not one could be aping 
a tree stump — or anything.” 

Billy was the skeptic. “Aw, how 
could a rock or a bush hurt you?” 

“Trouble is, they don’t stay that 
way, Billy. When you blunder 
against one, all of a sudden it 
gets big and round and arms like 
those of an octopus come out 
and grab you.” 

Billy said, “Aw — ” 

But he was impressed. 

The children turned back to 
678. He had become their friend, 
their confidant, their story-teller. 
Forty years of Moondust’s gusty 
tales were imprinted on his 
memory circuits, an inexhaustable 
store of colorful adventure related 
verbatim in the vigorous language 
of his master. 

It needed only Jill’s plea, “Tell 
us another story. Gappy.”

IF 




Oscillation of the brewer-rumph 
would intensify, the speaker which 
formed a round “O” where a 
mouth belonged would crackle 
and Cappy would begin, always 
a new yarn: “I remember one 
scary time when I got stuck on 
a mile-wide hunk of magnetite 
fizzling around an orbit out in 
the Betelgeuse sector — ” 

Or the story would take another 
track: “There used to be an old 
joy joint out in the Red Hills 
settlement on Mars where dust 
rats like me could get about every 
kind of entertainment a fellow 
could think of. An old witch by 
the name of Luna Maggie kept 
the blasted shack. I was sitting 
there fixing to kill my first liter 
of dreamer juice when this here 
dad-blastedandshummox-shucking 
Venusian went right into a change 
of gender. The frummel-gnittling 
chittler was neutral when it came 
in, but young ones don’t have 
enough experience to feel one of 
those dag-nabbed transformations 
coming on in time to get off by 
themselves. And the dad-burned 
cycle turned out to be female and 
I was the first male her eyes turn- 
ed on. And there I was, with 
the blasted thingamabob coming 
straight for me — ” 

Which brought Teena frothing 
to Moon. “You’ve got a stop that 
filthy mouthed old robot from 
telling stories to the twins.” 

And Moon would say sadly, 
“Cappy, we’ve got to remember 

ROBOT 678 



we’re in civilized company now 
and watch how we talk.” 

And the robot’s speaker would 
sizzle and an answer finally come: 
“All data filed in my circuits de- 
fine this as a remote, primitive 
planet, sir.” 

“This is the last straw,” Teena 
raged. “I won’t have that machine 
corrupting my children.” 

She stamped into the house and 
Moon said sadly, “Cappy, we just 
don’t seem to be able to keep 
out of the doghouse.” 

The robot answered, “The 
meaning of doghouse is obscure, 
sir.” 

R678 disappeared that night. 
Moondust Curtis went to sleep 
in his high-ceilinged bedroom 
whose broad windows looked past 
white columns across the sloping 
Bronta-dotted lawn to the moon- 
silvered river. Spicy scent of cork- 
roll blossoms drifted into the 
room. Bronta-fronds rattled like 
dry bones in a soft southern 
breeze. An occasional yiku or an 
eek punctuated the tropic night 
murmur. Moon’s eyes closed and 
his senses vaguely notified his 
somnambulant brain that Cappy 
stood in his accustomed place at 
the bedside, unsleeping and watch- 
ful over his master's health and 
safety. 

Middle of the night ululations 
of a Noddy pack coursing a 
breeding female disturbed Moon 
only slightly. Some other type of 
confusion touched him during the 

69 




dark hours but he fuzzily equated 
it with a wild dream whose ten- 
tacles clutched him. 

Moondust awoke to sun in his 
eyes and a rude racket of rock 
chickens somewhere in the rose 
garden. 

“Shut those things up, Cappy,'’ 
he muttered, then became aware 
that no eek or yiku answered. 
Moon sat up in bed growling, 
“Cappy, are you getting deaf?” 

He saw only emptiness where 
678 usually stood. Precariously 
balancing on the edge of his bed. 
Moon laboriously adjusted his ar- 
tificial limbs and pulled on his 
clothes, rattling the windows 
meanwhile with frantic bellows for 
the absent servant. 

He stomped downstairs, teeter- 
ing and swaying like a swimmer in 
a riptide. Teena was the first 
person to meet him. 

“Where’s Cappy?” he roared. 

Her pale eyes opened round 
and wide. 

“I really don’t know.” 

Moon staggered off down the 
warehouse path, yelping, “Cap- 
py — ” with one breath and, 
“Henry — ” with the next. 

Henry tried to make a joke 
of it. “Never can tell what will 
happen to junk piles like that 
robot. Maybe a circuit burned out 
and the thing’s gone AWOL — 
could be headed for the other 
side of the planet.” He saw the 
look in Moon’s eyes and suddenly 
assumed an aggrieved tone. “If I 

70 



took time off my job down here 
to keep track of that worn-out 
old machine you’d flay the hide 
off my back.” 

“That just might happen 
anyhow if you and that woman 
have done anything to Cappy.” 

“I don’t enjoy knowing that 
when something goes wrong 
around here I will automatically 
be accused of being responsible,” 
the clerk muttered. 

His words were strong but Hen- 
ry’s voice held an undertone of 
the born underling’s self-pity. 

Halfway to the Big House, 
Moondust met the twins. 

“Why can’t you go after Cap- 
py?” they begged. “Please? He’ll 
die. The Noddies are after him.” 
Jill was crying. “Will the Nod- 
dies eat him up?” 

“Mother says he won’t ever 
come back,” Billy gulped. 

Moon roared to silence the 
breathless stabbing of their words. 
“Here now — Be quiet. Who told 
you the Noddies have Cappy?” 
Bill stood straight and accusing. 
“Mother. She says you made him 
work too hard and that’s why 
he ran away. And you can’t bring 
him back because your legs won’t 
stand going. There’s nobody to 
find him.” 

Moon stomped off to say the 
harsh things he was thinking to 
the twins’ mother. She had pru- 
dently hidden herself. Not until 
midafternoon did her wailing ad- 
vertise her. 



IF 




“1 can't find the twins. What 
have you done with my children?” 
She pointed an accusing finger at 
Moon. 

Moon stomped away as fast 
as Ins metal legs would allow him, 
a fearful certainty in his mind. 
No special talent was needed to 
trace them to the river bank. A 
severed rope which had moored 
a rowboat told the rest as clearly 
as if a note had been left behind. 
The twins were across in the 
unexplored country of the Nod- 
dies, hunting for their robot 
friend. 

“You did this,” Moon stormed 
at Teena. “You told them that 
Cappy went across the river. 
You've killed those children.” 
Incoherently, between sobs, 
Teena repeated, “I couldn’t think 
of anything else to tell them. I 
didn’t know they would run away. 
I didn’t know — ” 

“And you and Henry did 
something to Cappy, between you. 
I can’t go after those children 
without Cappy to help me walk. 
What did you do with Cappy? 
Quick, While there’s time.” 

Teena cried, “I don’t know.” 
“All right. Stand there and lie 
and let your babies die.” 

Teena wrung her hands hel- 
plessly a moment, then moaned, 
“I made Henry dump the robot 
into the bayou.” 

Henry joined them, saying, 
“I’m responsible.” 

“Show me where,” Moon yelped. 

ROBOT 678 



“I don't know where,” the clerk 
answered, frightened into a falset- 
to by Moon’s ferocity. “I let a 
bunch of natives do the job.” 

The old man let out a bellow 
that shook the Bronta trees and 
headed for the river, striding with 
an awkward up and down motion 
on his artificial limbs. “I’m going 
across by myself,” he called back. 
“Any minute those poor kids 
might meet up with one of those 
thingamabobs. You find Cappy 
and git a new power pack in him 
and send him after me or I’ll 
tear you to pieces when I get 
back.” 

Moondust had a rowboat in the 
water when he heard the Bryn 
Mawr female calling. “You can’t 
go alone.” 

“Don’t bother me,” he roared 
and slipped the oars into the pins. 

“I’m going with you.” 

“I haven’t got time to take care 
of any female,” he snapped. 

“I’ve got two eyes and a 
shoulder you can lean on,” she 
answered, frosty and impatient. 

Moon had the blades dug deep 
by this time and pulled hard. He 
looked up in time to see the lady 
pull up her skirts and jump. She 
landed hard, thumping on to the 
stem thwart. The boat took some 
water. 

Moon roared. 

“It won’t do you any good to 
use that kind of language,” she 
said firmly. “You need help and 
I am the only other human being 



71 




IV 



on this planet who isn’t a sniveling 
idiot, so kindly continue your 
rowing.” 

The current rapidly whirled 
them out. 

She guided the old man, 
carefully scanning the opposite 
bank for a safe place to land, 
a spot with reasonable chance of 
being free from any wandering 
Noddy. 

The skiffs bottom soon scraped 
mud and Moon handed her an 
oar. 

“Now you hold this boat 
against the bank while I climb 
out,” he told her. 

Thumping, catching one metal 
foot under a thwart, he managed 
to scramble over the bow and 
crawl up the muddy slope, turning 
first to give the boat a hearty 
shove that sent it swirling out 
into swift river current. “I can’t 
have you along taking chances on 
getting killed,” he yelled. “Now 
get on home and make those two 
crazy people find Cappy and start 
him after me. I don’t want any 
dead females bothering my con- 
science.” 

She was scrambling to her 
knees, screaming, “That was most 
unkind of you.” And she grabbed 
the oars and worried the boat 
around, trying to pull awkwardly 
back tow'ard Moon. 

“You turn back across that 
river,” he called and entered the 
dense thicket without giving her 
opportunity to reply. 

72 



H umidity pressed upon him 
like huge balls of damp cot- 
ton, soaking his skin with hot 
perspiration, weighing upon his 
breath so that it seemed almost 
viscous to his nostrils. And thorn- 
studded branches tore at the old 
man. Underfoot there was no 
kindness for artificial limbs that 
could not feel and telegraph back 
to Moon’s brain the sudden 
upthrust of rock, tangle of vine 
or unseen softness of a swampy 
spot. 

Moon stumbled, fell, crawled, 
pulled himself erect, stumbled and 
fought each forward inch, calling 
at intervals the twins’ names. No 
echo came back through deadness 
of jungle-confined air. On Moon’s 
own side of the river there would 
have been vocal responses to the 
noise of his progress: the snort 
and hiss from a giant lizard, 
grunts, squeals, hasty stirring of 
retreating animal feet. But here 
nothing moved — nothing but the 
slow gyrations of a strangler vine 
caught his eye and not even 
vagrant whispers of heat-stirred 
air touched Moon’s eardrums. The 
forest lay dead. Moon’s calls died 
barely beyond his lips, absorbed 
by heavy foliage. And scattered, 
worried thoughts of the Noddies 
stared from subliminal corners of 
his mind — no animal species 
could survive the voraciousness of 
Noddy appetites, not even the 

IE 




weaker Noddies. There was no 
living being on this side of the 
river except Noddies. Moon knew 
he limped toward certain death. 
He knew the twins were already 
dead — yet he hoped for a miracle. 

When eventually steep incline 
and dense river forest gave way 
suddenly to scraggly brush and 
wide expanse of grassland. Moon 
just stood there completely spent, 
breathless, eyes unfocused for 
several moments. Tn the clearing's 
center one lone lichen-covered 
lava block stood man-high, a good 
place to lean and recover strength. 
But before moving to it. Moon 
turned a slow circle, a wary search 
for the possibility that a wander- 
ing Noddy might be close. He 
drew a breath of relief and out 
of the corner of his eyes caught 
a stirring. 

He froze, afraid to move. 
Slowly he shifted his gaze and 
saw the thing. What had seemed 
a rock half covered with scraggly 
moss was beginning t o 
dissolve — not dissolve, his mind 
amended, but flow — or like the 
trick camera work of Tri-D 
screens, a second image superim- 
posed itself over another and with 
increasing speed was blanking out 
the rock outlines. 

Ragged moss became a mass 
of coarse hair. Yellow and green 
patches of lichenlike growth 
gathered into warty scales. Rock 
planes relaxed into a knobby body 
that suddenly rose upon two 

ROBOT 678 



heavy legs. A single yellow eye 
with the glaze of an agate glared 
from under the thatch of tangled 
hair and a mouth cracked open 
beneath, a horrible maw — nar- 
row, almost pointed arch of teeth, 
three rows above, three below. 
A big shark-like mouth in a head 
nearly as large as the whole body. 

Moon was quick. He shot even 
as the false rock had begun its 
metamorphosis. He could see the 
passage of the projectile througli 
the Noddy, its body substance 
flexing and rolling like a bow- 
wave curling from the prow of 
a swiftly moving boat and like 
a w^ave, subsiding again into the 
mass from which it had risen. 
There was no second shot. Change 
came too fast. Even as a mouth 
formed over the rock-like first 
image, tentacles whipped out and 
Moon found himself in their tight 
curls. 

The Noddy moved with him, 
bounding high over bushes, grow- 
ing in stature as it raced aw'ay. 
Moon could hear breath snore in 
its single wrinkled nostril. He 
could hear a peculiar bubbling, 
like a chuckle, deep in the Nod- 
dy's throat, as if it laughed in 
ecstatic anticipation. And he 
could smell the beast — a filthy 
carrion scent. 

They whipped through a Bronta 
forest, then out on a barren slope. 
The Noddy headed up its steep 
surface, leaping over crevices and 
over crumpled up-thrusting dikes 

73 




of heat-puddled lava. Moon's 
captor topped the ridge. An an- 
cient crater lay below. The Noddy 
screamed and answering howls 
rose from the crater floor. 

Jumping, sliding, the Noddy 
flipped in a corkscrew course 
around the volcanic throat and 
raced across the jagged bottom 
toward basalt cliffs. There the 
tentacle coils unwound suddenly 
and Moon slammed upon pitted 
rock and rolled against the 
blackened wall. 

He sat up, painfully scratched. 
More of the frightful beings faced 
him, each with a single glazed 
eye focused unwinkingly upon 
Moon. Sudden silence let his heart 
sound like a drum in Moon's ears. 

Then he heard a low sobbing 
coming from around the edge of 
a buttress leaning from the crater 
wall. For a moment he thought 
it to be a variation upon the Nod- 
dy’s ululations. Then a human 
voice spoke — Billy, shaky but 
trying to comfort a crying Jill. 

“Billy — ’’ called Moon, and the 
twins ran into his arms. He turned 
to shield them but the frightful 
apparitions stared and made no 
menacing gesture toward their 
prisoners. 

The Noddies gathered in a 
group perhaps thirty feet away. 
They squatted in a semicircle and 
watched, tentacles at rest. It 
seemed they waited for something. 

The waiting was not long. Some 
time before Moondust could sense 

74 



any sound the Noddies rose from 
their squat and turned to face 
the opposite crater wall. And 
several breaths later, more of their 
tribe appeared high on the rim. 
They screamed and held high a 
human body. It could be no other 
than the Bryn Mawr female. 

“Stubborn woman,” Moon 
thought. 

The Noddies bounded in a cir- 
cular sidehill slant toward the 
crater bottom. Their comrades at 
the bottom began a weird pro- 
longed scream and were soon 
answered. Sound rose and rever- 
berated on the crater walls 
throughout the descent, until the 
climbers leaped over the last bar- 
rier of brush and tossed their bur- 
den in a rolling tumble toward 
Moon. 

The old man was able to place 
himself as a buffer between the 
Bryn Mawr female and the jagged 
rock wall but the collision sent 
him tumbling. 

She helped him up, saying with 
wry coolness, “We’re in something 
of a pickle.” 

Moon scarcely heard. “That 
hard metal in my legs hurt you?” 

She said, “Not as much as the 
rock would have.” 

The Noddies squatted again, all 
but one. It moved in a swaying 
short-step dance from one end of 
their line to the other. Then the 
thing faced them and its enormous 
mouth opened. The other Noddies 
opened their mouths in unison. 

IF 




The leader snapped his shut, and 
the triple row of sharp teeth 
clicked unpleasantly. The Noddy 
line clicked teeth in response. 
Then, one at a time, each imitated 
the steps of the leader. 

“Interesting,” said the Bryn 
Mawr person. “I would think this 
is some kind of ritual preparation 
for dining.” 

She scribbled in her notebook. 

“Won’t do you any good to 
write in that book,” Moon told 
her. “We’re done for.” 

“I am aware of that. T am 
aware also that the human being 
often muddles his way out of ut- 
terly hopeless situations. I shall 
conceal my notebook in some 
crevice at the last moment and 
hope it will be found and a bit 
more information added to man’s 
store.” 

Moon said suddenly^ “You’re 
quite a lady.” 

The corners of her mouth 
crinkled. 

The Noddy dance became more 
complicated now, their line sway- 
ing in hop-step toward the cap- 
tives. 

Frenzy crept into the ceremony. 
Noddies’ breathing quickened, 

snoring loudly through single nos- 
trils. Only a few feet separated 
the monsters from their captives 
now. A low wail added itself to 
the clash of teeth. 

A new sound sifted through the 
cacophony: **Eek hoowah* 

hoowoh hrewer-rumph, yikti 

ROBOT 678 



hoowah-hoowoh brewer-rumph.** 
Moon roared, “Gappy!” 

The children were crying, 
“Gappy — here’s Gappy — ” 

Loose rock rattled down the 
crater wall and Robot 678 
followed,- sliding the last dozen 
feet to thump with a clattering 
of metal. 

“Get us out of this mess, you 
damned tin can,” Moon yelped. 

R678’s speaker sizzled and his 
flat tones answered, “It will be 
necessary to furnish more data 
re the meaning of ‘mess,’ sir.” 
Before Moon could reply the 
Noddies began their last rush, 
jaws wide, a moaning sound of 
anticipation in their throats. Gap- 
py turned and moved out to meet 
them, arms flailing. The pack 
swarmed upon him, four of the 
stinking creatures at once. They 
sprang, jaws crunching upon the 
robot’s arms and legs. Gappy went 
down. 

Four Noddy voices screamed 
in waves of ascending yells. They 
backed away from the robot, 
howling. Tentacles writhed toward 
mouths. There was blood on the 
gaping jaws, a thick greenish 
purple. Pieces of broken teeth fell 
from the mouths. A fifth Noddy 
plunged upon the prostrate robot 
and clamped its jaws on a waving 
leg. Its scream rose above the 
other four and it stood, tentacles 
reaching into its mouth. 

Moon yelled, “Go to it. Gap- 
py — ^break their jaws!” 



75 




But the Noddies backed away 
from 678. They passed him, 
ignoring the kicking legs, moving 
more warily now toward the other 
captives. The Bryn Mawr person 
turned to hug the children closer 
and cover them with her body. 
Moon stood between them and 
the advancing tribe, knowing this 
was the end. 

The old man hobbled out to 
meet the fright things. He picked 
up a rock large enough to crush 
a skull and brought it down hard 
on the leading Noddy’s head. The 
rock twisted and curved off, 
shunted by the strange yielding 
flesh of the Noddy. 

Every bit of Moon's strength 
had been in the blow. He followed 
the rock to the ground, rolling 
on his back, helpless, legs waving 
in the air. And the Noddies were 
upon him, great jaws clamping 
down on those thrashing limbs. 

And they screamed and backed 
away, spitting out broken teeth. 

“My legs — my legs — ” Moon 
called out. “They broke their jaws 
on these damned imitation legs! ’ 
Moon rolled over and thrust 
a leg at the nearest Noddy. It 
backed away, howling. “Come on, 
Cappy!” Moon shouted. “Bust 
some more teeth!” 

R678 clanked to his feet and 
stomped toward the Noddies, The 
Bryn Mawr female helped Moon 
to his feet and the humans faced 
the howling aborigines. Humans 



stepped forward and the Noddies 
edged backward. 

“Run, you frummel-gnittling 
chittlcrs,” Moondust taunted. He 
staggered after them, ripping off 
every colorful piece of vocabulary 
he knew. And suddenly the 
monsters broke, whirled toward 
the crater’s opposite wall and up 
its steep side in ten-foot leaps. 
Their howling could be heard long 
after the things disappeared over 
the rim. 

I T WAS dawn before Henry and 
Tecna heard an old familiar 
eek hoowah-hoowoh brewer- 
riuuph, yikii hoowah-hoowoh 
hrewer-rumph and saw against the 
growing gray of river fog the tall 
awkward form of 678 clumping 
along, Moondust sitting conir 
fortably in the crook of one. arm, 
the other hand holding the little 
fingers of Jill, with Billy grasping 
her right hand, and the Bryn 
Mawr person striding alongside. 

And the last mellowing stage 
crept over Moon. He found 
himself thinking of her as a com- 
panion — with Tcena, the allergic 
clerk and the uncommitted 
Venusian cook banished to Ad- 
ministration house. But those who 
wailed were aware of nothing but 
eek hoowah-hoowoh brewer- 
rumph, yiku hoowah-hoowoh 
brewer-rumph. What went on in 
Moon’s mind sprang at them 
much later, like a Noddy. •

But each time Levy’s murderous 
attack drove him out. He lost the 
point and retired to the clinic. 

The bored paramed had an 
ulnar pin ready to insert. He 
quickly swabbed Zuliani's elbow 
and stabbed the skin. Zuliani put 
his mind elsewhere as the drill 
moved the long pin down the 
medullary space of the broken 
bone, splinting the fragments from 
the inside. 

“Forty minutes,” announced a 
sibilant voice from Zuliani’s belt. 

He closed his eyes and 
cautiously relaxed his autonomies. 
Pain appeared, delineating the 
fracture lines around the pin in 
his left forearm. Lesser soft-tissue 
traumas went unnoticed by his 
cerebral cortex. Tears welled up 
momentarily. Then, as the nerve 
endings dulled, he slept. The 
paramed covered him with a 
blanket and quietly tidied up his 
surgical tray for the afternoon 
Games. 

Robert Zuliani the Sixth (sixth 
generation colonist from Earth) 
had just lost in Procyon’s 
Semifinals, bested by the bulky 
Negro, Levy. In less than an hour 
they both would reenter the Ring 
to face new opponents: Levy 
fighting for a First Place, Zuliani 
for Third. Meanwhile they rested, 
while recharging their neurones. 
Zuliani’s belt soothed him with 
his favorite gladiator music, the 
low notes slightly distorted by its 
resonance limitations. 



The music stopped. “Five 
minutes,” announced the belt. 

Zuliani sat up, wincing at the 
arm pain. He concentrated. The 
pain diminished. He reasoned that 
his next opponent would probably 
have essentially the same number 
of injuries, having faced the same 
number of Ring encounters, so 
his own pinned ulna shouldn’t be 
too much of a handicap. Stoically 
he walked out to face 
Jones — young, sinewy and a 
genetic Amerind. 

L eaving the clinic’s astringent 
odors, Zuliani returned to the 
Ring and the ominous smell of 
death — blood and urine spilled by 
the decerebrate losers. Jones ap- 
proached stiff-legged. Much of his 
racial pigmentation was now 
masked by layers of protec- 
tive — as well as rather anony- 
mous — syntheskin. Zuliani hoped 
the limp indicated a serious knee 
injury, such as a rewired patella. 
(It took more than self-hypnosis 
to get a weight-bearing joint’s 
function back.) 

Their telemetered cardiograms 
ticked off a hundred regular beats 
and the paramed nodded them in- 
to the thirty-yard-diameter Ring. 
Jones’s limp vanished as he cir- 
cled warily. Sparring, they assess- 
ed each other’s reaction times. 
Feinting and blocking, they 
quickly burned up what little ner- 
vous reserve they had been 
hoarding for this final match.

Jones, a serious businessman, 
directed a growing mining opera- 
tion. He considered The Games 
an avocation; tomorrow he’d be 
back exploiting the planet’s 
mineral resources. His strength 
and enthusiasm had carried him 
this far, but to him it was still 
just a game. 

On the other hand, Zuliani was 
a born competitor. He had literal- 
ly been bred for the Ring, his 
parents being selected for their 
winning qualities. The cybernetic 
belt he wore marked him as one 
of the Competitor genetic lines. 
His parents had “won” and his 
entire lifetime had been spent in 
preparation. The belt had raised 
him, setting his habits and pro- 
viding for his essentials. He had 
been honed for the Games. 

In their stumbling they found 
themselves grappling awkwardly. 
Zuliani locked his grip around 
Jones’s waist and wrenched him 
off his feet. Jones threw his arms 
out wide and chopped viciously 
at Zuliani’s straining neck — bruis- 
ing the soft tissues under the angle 
of the jaw and depolarizing the 
nerves in the carotid sinus. Zu- 
liani’s heart stopped. 

Zuliani felt a dull flop in his 
chest as his heart squeezed out 
its last beat, marking the begin- 
ning of the loud silence of 
asystole. Terror showed on his 
face but his mind schemed. He 
still had almost a minute to win 
the point. His grip tightened to 

STAR SEEDER 



the sound of a wet popping in 
Jones’s spine, until cerebral anox- 
ia tipped him over. 

His telemetered cardiac arrest 
brought the resuscitator team to 
oxygenate his convulsing body. 
Jones limped from the Ring. The 
team worked. Zuliani’s en- 
cephalogram hardly missed a 
spike but his cardiogram remained 
isoelectric. The clock ran. 

Suddenly the team jumped 
back, as if they had just roped 
and tied a calf. Zuliani’s heart 
was beating again and the point 
was still to be won. The paramed 
counted out a hundred systoles 
and waved Jones back into the 
Ring. Zuliani’s gaze cleared. He 
rolled over into a crouch — alert. 

Zuliani’s neck and shoulder 
muscles bunched and twitched. 
Jones stood there for a moment, 
evaluating the killer he faced, 
while his own aches and pains 
welled up against him. Zuliani’s 
last bear-hug had momentarily 
displaced several vertebrae and 
had polarized his lumbar au- 
tonomies — nerves he relied upon 
to mask the pain impulses from 
his legs injuries. His gait became 
stiff-legged in spite of his concen- 
tration. He backed out of the ring. 
Zuliani pounced — feinting — psy- 

chologically driving his opponent 
back from the edge of the ring. 

Jones weighed his chances in 
the ring against the immediate 
relief of the pain medication. 
Fourth place was good enough

for a hobby. He had his family, 
his job — and another chance next 
year. Opting for fourth, Jones 
reclined on the floor, leaving 
Zuliani standing alone. 

T hird place in The Games. 

It seemed to satisfy the belt. 
But it didn’t satisfy Zuliani. 

A year earlier he had placed 
tenth in the planetwide Long Run. 
Now he would travel to the 
equator and train for next year’s 
thirty-hour Swim. He’d probably 
not even make the top ten in 
that event. A fine Competitor he 
was turning out to be. 

He stopped in front of a public 
dispenser, ignoring the credit card 
slot. A rivet-sized optic pickup 
on his belt focused. His index 
finger moved down the list of 
choices, pausing at a stringy pro- 
tein, a semiliquid carbohydrate 
and a small, sticky fat. Each time 
his finger stopped, his belt spoke 
silently to the machine, and the 
food item dropped into the chute. 
“Thanks, belt,” he said, eating. 
“Y'welcome.” 

T he year in the Tropics went 
smoothly for Zuliani. His 
belt — in contact with several of 
the alert cybernetic off-shore 
buoys — led him to ample ocean 
edibles. His ab-iron and spear 
supplied protein, while machine- 
cultivated flora supplied carbohy- 
drates. He seldom had to resort 
to the dispensers. 



, He fathered an eight-pound 
baby girl and placed seventh in 
the Long Swim. Jones placed fifty- 
fourth, and Levy — lacking an 
adequate amount of subcutaneous 
fat— dragged himself in after the 
“medal positions” were closed. 

“That’s another medal for us,” 
congratulated his belt as he 
crawled up on the twin-hulled 
“cat” after his swim. 

“But no first places,” he 
gasped, glancing at the six ex- 
hausted humans who had arrived 
before him. 

“You’ve medaled straight 
through. Your profile may be the 
current highest,” reassured the 
belt. 

His profile proved the highest 
and the celebration lasted three 
days. Overindulgence— considered 
a vice by everyone of the com- 
petitors — brought little joy to 
Zuliani. But he mingled easily 
with the celebrants, accepting 
their accolades. His profile did 
entitle his new daughter to a cere- 
monial genetic belt of the type he 
wore through life; and this glad- 
dened him. It assured her of status 
in life — a Competitor. After her 
belt was awarded he bowed out, 
taking one of the single-seaters to 
a mountain retreat. 

T he hovercraft slipped quietly 
out of the cloud layer and 
hung for a moment above the 
damp fir trees. Its headlights 
flickered about, searching. Then, 

IF

deep among the trees, a small, 
rustic cabin blinked back; and the 
craft landed. A fireplace came to 
life as the cabin’s circuits awoke. 
Wisp of resin-scented smoke curl- 
ed out of the conglomerate chim- 
ney. The hovercraft’s class VII 
brain ruminated a moment and 
then roused its sleeping cargo. 

‘'Up, Zuliani. You’re here.” 

Blinking, he stumbled from the 
craft and shuffled up the path, 
allowing most of his mind and 
body to enjoy the languid state 
of half-sleep. Sullen softwoods 
crowded out of the night mists. 
The cool mountain air went un- 
noticed as he pictured the soft 
bed that awaited him. The craft’s 
directional speaker focused soft 
music on his receding back. 

“Zuliani?” came the question- 
ing voice of a female in the 
darkness over his right shoulder. 

Turning, he peripherally saw a 
shadowy form. 

“Kick, kick, kick!” shouted his 
belt. 

Instantly he bent over at the 
waist and drove his right heel out 
hard. A bright flash warmed the 
air and the acrid stench of singed 
moss filled his olfactory bulbs. 
He saw a Bodkin III hand-laser 
tumble into the moist pine needles 
and heard the sound of his 
assailant thrashing in the brush. 
He crouched, silent. A small flame 
flickered up in the moss and then 
went out. The assailant’s move- 
ments stopped. 

STAR SEEDER 



“Thanks, belt,” he whispered. 

“Welcome,” said the belt. 

Belatedly, bright lights from the 
cabin illuminated the low, white 
clouds, bringing bright high-noon 
visibility. 

“We're alone,” reassured the 
belt. 

He stood up and walked to 
the still form of his assailant. A 
female. Her abdominal muscles 
were still twitching, but no breath 
moved through her open mouth. 
He felt no pulse. Between her 
breasts he saw his brown-stained 
heel print. The sternum was de- 
pressed and made gritty sounds 
when he palpated it. Fractured. 
And probably displaced into the 
mediastinum, cutting off venous 
blood flow back to the heart. He 
grabbed both of her wrists and 
jerked them over her head, lever- 
ing the bone fragments up. 

Her heart fluttered and began 
to beat as soon as the pressure 
was taken off the large veins. Slie 
gasped several times, mouthing 
like a dry fish. Her face pinked 
up. 

She looked to be about his age, 
mid-twenties. A stranger. Not 
unattractive. Dressed in a thermal 
suit and boots. Empty holster. A 
small back pack. 

“Assassin,” said his belt in a 
matter-of-fact tone. 

He raised his eyebrows. “How 
can you tell?” 

“Her cold, businesslike ex- 
pression as she squeezed the trig- 

81 




ger. Her finger was already start- 
ing to tighten as you turned. No 
question about it. She was just 
going to kill you. Fry you on 
the spot — no questions asked,” 
answered the belt. 

H er eyes opened wide — 
briglit, screaming sclerae. 
Her face tightened into a grimace 
exposing regular, white teeth. 
Growling and clawing for his 
throat, she tried to leap up, only 
to invite another thrust against 
her already damaged breast bone. 
She went down in a heap, and 
he resuscitated her by pressing 
her elbows up over her head. 

“Relax! Take it easy or I’ll 
turn you off again,” he warned. 

Her eyes opened. This time 
they appeared glassy and failed 
to focus. The last anoxic episode 
must have scrambled her memory 
a bit, he thought. 

He tightened the straps of her 
back pack to splint her rib cage. 
Then he carried her into the cabin 
where 'he quickly taped her 
shoulders back with a heavy 
figure-eight bandage. Then her 
breathing became easier. She lay 
still, watching him as he deac- 
tivated the Bodkin HI. Leaving 
his belt to watch her, Zuliani 
crawled wearily into the other 
bunk and slept soundly. 

“Visitors,” announced the belt. 
The prisoner opened her eyes 
but remained still. Zuliani sat up. 
He heard footsteps approaching 



the cabin. The door opened and 
four uniformed young men step- 
ped quickly inside. They carried 
hand weapons. An older soldier, 
thick of neck and wrist, remained 
outside. He beckoned for Zuliani 
to join him. 

“Colonel Budd. We’re Alien 
Security,” the older soldier said 
as he shook Zuliani’s hand firmly. 

“Alien?” repeated Zuliani 
blankly. 

“Your prisoner,” began the 
colonel. “Oh, I keep forgetting 
how naive some of you Com- 
petitors are. You were almost 
killed by an off-worlder last night. 
She — or it — is from another 
planet. Another star system 
altogether. Your capturing it was 
a break for us. Gives us a hostage 
as well as a specimen for study.” 

Zuliani glanced back inside. He 
knew of life on other planets — his 
ancestors had come from one. 
Earth. But other planets held 
man. Humans, not aliens. 

“But we’ve never heard of — ” 
began the belt. 

The colonel glanced down at 
the four-inch wide belt — 
featureless except for a few small 
rivets — audio membranes and 
microcircuits hidden in its eighth- 
of-an-inch thinness. 

“You’re not supposed to be 
here. This is classified,” said the 
colonel. He motioned for one of 
his aides. The belt loosened itself 
and was carried silently into the 
cabin. 



82 



IF 




The colonel waited until they 
were alone and continued : “She’s 
a Dreg. A non-human. Subhuman. 
Her race lives out in the Rim 
of our galaxy. They have some 
sort of a bizarre relationship with 
their machines — use them for re- 
production and everything. This 
is the first time I’ve ever seen 
one of them away from its 
machine. I’m half afraid it’ll self- 
destruct or something.” 

They were interrupted by a 
squad of parameds carrying a 
stretcher into the cabin. The 
number of soldiers in the area 
seemed to be increasing. Zuliani 
stared. 

“But she doesn’t look much 
different — ” 

“Oh, she’s one of them, all 
right. Easy to spot. Full of wires 
and transmitters. Show up' on the 
scope like one of our self- 
contained communicator booths,” 
said the colonel. 

The Dreg was carried out, her 
willowy frame strapped firmly to 
the stretcher. Armed guards 
glanced warily about. They filed 
down the trail and into a large 
personnel carrier. Other military 
hovercraft were scattered about 
the valley at treetop level. 

“Zuliani, you might as well 
return to the base with us,” sug- 
gested Colonel Budd. The silent 
guard formed up behind them, 
giving Zuliani little choice in the 
matter. The belt made the trip 
in one of the lesser vehicles. Its. 



optic pickup cleared and it eyed 
the Dreg’s back pack and Bodkin 
III suspiciously. 

The morning sun burned tlie 
mists out of the little valley. As 
the troops left, silence returned. 
In a few minutes the cabin’s cir- 
cuits had returned to standby. 

A s THEY lifted off, Zuliani 
noticed the Dreg’s face go 
white. She started to retch. He 
motioned for one of the parameds 
to help and they hastily unbuckled 
her shoulder strap. She sat up 
and vomited copiously. Her ster- 
num gave an audible crunch with 
each effort. Then she collapsed 
back onto the stretcher, breathing 
weakly. 

Comfortable in the colonel’s 
cabin, Zuliani and Budd watched 
the Dreg on the viewscreen. Her 
straps had been loosened and the 
parameds — mostly young and 
conscious — quickly busied them- 
selves around the now trembling 
female form. 

“Lucky for you that we arrived 
in time. No telling what they 
would have tried next,” said the 
colonel. 

“How did you know?” asked 
Zuliani. 

“Your class sevens reported up 
through channels. Of course they 
didn’t know the significance of 
it — not knowing about the Dregs. 
But when it reached the class 
threes, we were then notified,” 
answered Budd. 



STAR SEEDER 



83 




Budd explained that the Dreg 
spaceship had appeared in the 
Procyon system about thirty years 
ago, carrying human genetic 
material. The suspended sperm, 
eggs, embryos and fetuses had 
been part of the cargo of one 
of Earth's Implant Starships — the 
one bound Out Galaxy to An- 
dromeda. Neither the genetic 
material nor the Implant Starship 
had been damaged and the Dregs 
continued to maintain that their 
intentions were peaceful — until 
this attack on Zuliani. 

“If they are so peaceful — why 
did they stop our ancestor’s 
starship in the first place?” ask(^d 
Zuliani. 

“They don’t want man to leave 
this galaxy. Oh, it is more com- 
plicated than that. But their view 
of mankind is some sort of a 
naked anthropoid cluttering up 
planets with his babies and 
civilized garbage. Their machine- 
run planets are supposed to be 
long on flowers and philosophy 
and short on men. Those Dregs! 
They worship natural beauty — 
open space — unspoiled, virgin 
planets. They shudder at our ran- 
dom approach to our ecology — 
violence, madness and disease. 
After we ‘contaminate’ a star 
system they find it no longer 
suitable for meditation. The way 
we’re going they fear that only 
the other galaxies will have a 
chance to remain pure and un- 
spoiled. Their machines are 



powerful and they control the 
Rim. They can probably keep us 
here — unless we want to go to 
war. And the politicians don’t 
want that,” said Budd. 

“But they are still holding our 
spaceship,” said Zuliani bellig- 
erently. “Isn’t that an act of war?” 
The colonel shrugged. “They’re 
too clever for that. They say that 
they'll return the ship, or — they’ll 
let it continue its journey as a 
scout ship. One human can go.” 

Z ULIANI raised his eyebrows. 

“One human — no sexual re- 
production.” 

“Right.” 

“And the other Earth life 
forms: the plants and animals in 
suspension?” 

“Intact.” 

“The Tattering apparatus?” 
“Intact. With mechanical em- 
bryogenesis the scout could make 
genetic carbon copies of himself 
from any of his diploid, somatic 
cells. Theoretically he could put 
armies all over Andromeda — each 
surrounded by an Earth biosphere 
of plants and animals,” said Col- 
onel Budd. 

Zuliani thought for a minute 
or two. The Tatteripg ap- 
paratus — standard equipment in 
most starships — provided efficient 
genetic copying. A single cell from 
a carrot, frog or a man could 
be embryonated into a new in- 
dividual. All that was required 
was a class VI computer, a 

IF 



84 




greenhouse life-support system 
and time. Gestation by that 
method took no longer than when 
triggered sexually. 

When Professor Tatter had 
succeeded in producing the first 
human being in his prototype 
machine he had said something 
about “predictable genetic copy- 
ing’’ and an “improved race of 
man.” Obviously the Dregs had 
a similar attitude toward a 
monogenetic. Tattered race of hu- 
mans. Being all of one sex they’d 
be dependent on the mechanical 
asexual reproduction. Not much 
danger of “contaminating” a 
planet. The technology required 
to support the Tattering apparatus 
was infinitely greater than the re- 
quirements of a pregnant human 
female. 

Colonel Budd continued: “The 
Dregs have no fear of a machine- 
dependent mankind. We’d be like 
them. They’d probably consider 
us a higher form of life — like 
themselves — and they could deal 
with us as equals.” 

At their destination the person- 
nel carrier landed immediately 
while the lesser craft stacked 
themselves in the sky to await 
instructions. The Dreg — ap- 
parently asleep — was rushed into 
a low-profile blockhouse under 
heavy guard. Colonel Budd and 
Zuliani strolled more leisurely 
towards a tall glass-and-plastic- 
tower. Everyone they passed 
wore a large T.D. badge. Heavy 

STAR SEEDER 



gates and doors buzzed open and 
shut as they passed. Zuliani began 
to get apprehensive. The reason 
for his presence became clearer 
as the guards casually nodded him 
through the gates — him with 
nothing more than his face to 
identify him. 

Obviously he was more than 
the object of an attempted 
assassination. He was to be the 
Andromeda scout. 

Z ULIANI felt ridiculous in the 
foil and ceramic costume. 
Designed to lull the Dregs, this 
comic “space-scout suit” had been 
embellished with gaudy boots, 
gauntlets, helmet and even with 
extremely unsophisticated elec- 
tronic gewgaws. Even his belt, 
which contained a class VI brain, 
had been disguised with a scab- 
bard and small tool kits. The cap- 
tive mended while the colonel 
negotiated. 

The Dreg ship sat exactly where 
it had appeared thirty years 
before, a human force field cov- 
ering it. The military base which 
had grown up around it controlled 
the aliens' contacts with the 
planet. Communications and 
visitors were monitored. On the 
other hand, the Dregs seemed 
eager to have themselves and their 
ship's gear examined. Their 
machines appeared competent but 
not overly bright. Children were 
born on the ship, whose quarters 
provided room for about a hun- 

85 




dred adults. They aged rapidly, 
but none seemed to be over the 
age of thirty. 

Negotiations went along very, 
very smoothly. Dreg command 
soon apologiz^ for the actions of 
the assassin — claimed she acted as 
an individual, and offered to have 
lier executed when she was 
released. The colonel demurred. 
The captive remained in her cell. 

The Dregs agreed to free the 
Andromeda starship. They would 
accept Zuliani as the scout and 
transport him out to their Rim 
territory with their own ship. 

^ w ULiANi sat by the captive’s 
bunk, his helmet balanced 
on his knee. A delicate chain 
tethered her right ankle to a ring 
in the wall. Her guileless con- 
versations truly fascinated him. 
Evidently the Dregs never learned 
to lie. Or they couldn’t. Or — and 
the possibility worried him — they 
were the best liars in the universe. 

She sat up and began brushing 
her hair whenever he visited. The 
crackle of the static electricity 
seemed to relax her. Perhaps it 
helped drown out whatever bug- 
ging devices were built into herself 
or the room. 

“Glad to see you haven’t left.” 

“Because when I do go it'll 
mark the end of your way of 
life?” he said, picking up the con- 
versation where they had left off 
the previous morning. 

She continued to brush. Her 




arms still moved stiffly, as her 
clavicles and pectoralis muscles 
were tender from her injury. She 
had been born on this planet and 
so was probably younger than he. 
Her Meck-angel — the machine she 



36 





grew up with — had mentioned he began. “But we’re treating you 
Zuliani’s competition record when well.” 

the colonel had announced his “Only because it serves your 
winning the High Profile award, purposes,” she said. “You’d kill

a? 



He started to object mildly. 

She continued; “1 know youVe 
going to say it was my gun up 
in the mountains. But the fact 
that I failed to kill you points 
out the differences in our cultures. 
We Symbiots — or Dregs, as you 
call us — are very peaceful. From 
an ordered, peaceful planet. We 
have no competition for sur- 
vival — no famine, war or disease. 
We don't waste nature’s resources. 
We just improve our minds and 
bodies. And — and — ” she search- 
ed for words. 

“And are happy” he supplied. 

“We’re really no match for 
you — killers — carnivores. You who 
actually are trained to kill. That's 
repulsive,” she said. 

Zuliani leaned into the con- 
versation. 

“You call us killers and shud- 
der. Aren’t you competing with 
us for Andromeda? Weren’t you 
planning to kill for your aims?” 

“Not at all,” she answered. 
“We're not going to colonize An- 
dromeda. We seldom have the 
need to add a new planet to our 
federation. We just don't want to 
.see you humans rushing out there 
while you're still a young, ignorant 
race. You'll spoil it. Waste the 
resources and clutter it up with 
your — civilization.” 

“But later it will be okay?” be 
asked. 

“Certainly. When you have 
evolved into a more conserv- 
ative race — such as our own. 



Then perhaps vve can explore 
together — with our machines.” 

“But you don't want me to go 
now — as a scout?” he said. 

Her voice became sullen. 
“You're no scout. You’re a Com- 
petitor. Suffering or waste doesn’t 
bother you. You’ll try to go out 
there and populate the next galaxy 
just because it is th^re. You don't 
want to save anything for the 
future races.” 

They stared silently at each 
other for a moment. Then Zuliani 
shrugged and left. Their con- 
versations were always the same. 

II 

oi ONEL Budd took Zuliani 

J through the mockup of the 
alien craft. 

“Td swear that their machines 
arc getting simpler each year. 
Here is their astrogation center. 
Sec how all the star maps are 
projected from the Rim and again 
from the Hub. They don’t seem 
to favor any one Arm more than 
another. Makes it hard for us to 
evaluate which zones they actually 
control. 

“Their suspension apparatus is 
quite similar to ours — graded 
hypothermia, oxygen squeeze and 
hypertonics. Similarities in life 
support are obvious. Their 
physiology is almost identical to 
ours. But here is where the 
problems come in — bulkheads,” 
said the colonel. 




Zuliani palpated the mock-up 
walls — three and four feet of 
smooth-surfaced dividers between 
the ship’s compartments. 

“Our engineers tell us there 
is no reason for much of the space 
these walls take up. In some sec- 
tions you could squeeze whole 
extra rooms into the damn walls. 
I’m suspicious — but I can’t very 
well go cutting into their ship 
without their permission,” said the 
colonel. 

Zuhani shrugged again. After 
talking to the captive he’d accept 
almost any explanation for the 
unused space taken up by wall 
width — probably part of Dreg 
religion — to save some space for 
the future generations. 

T he next day Zuliani met one 
of the Dreg’s machines — 
supposedly the Meck-angel which 
had raised the captive female 
assailant. It stood four feet 
high — a small head and body on 
soft, bulky treads. It had two 
arms, two eyes and a mandible- 
like mouth that clicked when it 
talked. 

“Click, click. You Zuliani? You 
scout?” it asked awkwardly. 

Zuliani fingered the hilt of a 
new broadsword that hung by his 
left side. A bright red cape draped 
his left shoulder, contrasting 
sharply with the silver sheen of his 
ceramic and foil costume. 

^‘Mc scout,” he said. 

His belt winced. 

STAR SEEDER 



The force fields were shut down 
and the Meck-angel led Zuliani, 
the colonel and his entourage into 
the belly of the alien starship. A 
half a dozen Dregs of assorted 
sizes and body colors were 
installing a suspension tank for 
the scout. It was hard to believe 
that they were all genetic carbon 
copies — but by means of hormone 
management, their bodies had 
been molded — pituitary hormones 
for size, and gonadal hormones 
for sexual characteristics. Body 
paints added to the variety. 

Two large male Dregs helped 
the parameds hook up the fifty- 
liter container of suspension 
fluids. The tank’s membranes 
would use the alien’s life-support 
fluids for the gas exchange. 

“Click, click. What are in these 
small tanks?” asked the Meck- 
angel. 

The paramed moved his index 
finger across the row of 
transparent bottles connected to 
the pump by a web of tubes. 

“Induction sedatives. Energy 
concentrate. And also rewarming 
sedatives — ” There was one bottle 
left. 

" “And— click, click, click?” 

“And adrenal steroids to buffer 
his system against the shock,” said 
the paramed. 

Zuliani glanced at the controls. 
The low temperature readings 
frightened him a little. But he 
knew that the alien faster-than- 
light drive involved powerful 

89 




fields. Stress lines would polarize 
any living cell that was not frozen 
solid. He was not afraid of the 
hazards themselves — he simply 
preferred to be awake when he 
faced them. 

But he would have to sleep 
through this one. 



B ack in the briefing room an 
aide asked for Zuliani’s belt 
and took it out of the room. 

“You are leaving tonight. The 
medic here is going to give you 
a run-down on this transparent 
mannequin, pointing out the latest 
data we have on the Dregs’ 
personal circuitry. These small 
transducers in the skull may be 
used to communicate directly to 
the cerebral cortex. This could 
give the appearance of mental 
telepathy. The energy converters 
are here in the large leg muscles. 
Autonomies are heavily wired for 
monitoring — should be able to 
control pain and emotions better 
than you. And remember — the 
Meck-angel may very well be in 
charge, not the biological huma- 
noid,” said Colonel Budd. 

As the medic began to outline 
the circuits, Zuliani wondered 
where they had gotten such de- 
tailed information. He hoped it 
hadn’t come from a dissection. 
But then he caught himself — after 
all, these were aliens he was 
thinking about. 

“Now about the Dregs’ 



genetics,” the medic continued. 

“They have an uneven number 
of chromosomes. This explains 
their dependence on machines for 
their reproduction. The nuclear 
material is decidedly human — just 
a minor error here,” he said, 
pointing to the karyogram. “This 
then matches up as two X 
chromosomes — the larger ones. 
And this tiny one looks like a 
Y. We’ve decided that the best 
interpretation is an XXY anomaly. 
They are unable to make haploid 
sex cells — no eggs or sperms. 
But — by exposing the embryo to 
high levels of estrogen — they can 
cause the female organs to 
develop fairly normally. And a 
high testosterone level would give 
them a passable male body. But 
they’re sterile.” 

Zuliani glanced up. “An extra 
chromosome?” 

“Yes. They have forty-seven. 
Normal humans have forty- 
six — forty-four somatic and two 
sex.” 

Sterile, thought Zuliani — re- 
membering the definitely male and 
female Dregs he had seen. 

“Isn’t there something that can 
be done to correct it? If there 
is just one extra chromosome?” 
asked Zuliani. 

The medic smiled and conti- 
nued that line of thought. 

“Why don’t we just pick out 
the extra one — leaving a normal 
cell? In theory it sounds fine. Ac- 
tually there is a human genetic

defect like that XXY — it’s the 
Klinefelter’s syndrome. B y 

removing an X it leaves an XY 

pair (normal male) — and by 
removing the Y it leaves an XX 
pair (female). Research biologists 
working with cell cultures from 
these patients have been suc- 
cessful in removing the 

chromosomes many times. They 
have to do it under phase micro- 
scopy as the living cell goes into 
metaphase at the beginning of cell 
division (when the chromosomes 
can be seen best). But so 
far — nothing. Going through the 
nuclear membranes with a hook 
is not the best way to get a good 
cell division. There are molecular 
and ionic forces at work, dividing 
up the genetic material. And 
sticking anything into the cell just 
wrecks everything. Maybe some 
day,” answered the medic. 

It looked easy on paper. Oh, 
well. Zuliani glanced at the col- 
onel. 

“Now Zuliani, we want to give 
you a posthypnotic suggestion. 
Something important to you and 
the human race — for when you 
arrive at the starship. You’ll be 
traveling in the Dregs’ ship, so 
there is no way we can com- 
municate with you without their 
knowing. Just put yourself in a 
trance and the hypnotists will take 
over from there.” 

Zuliani snapped his mind out 
of his body, using the same 
techniques that protected him 

STAR SEEDER 



from pain during the Games. 
When he woke up he was on 
the Implant Starship leaving the 
Galaxy for Andromeda. 

Ill 

i t T T ow do you feel?” asked 
XI the high-pitched voice. 

“Fine, belt,” Zuliani answered, 
picking up his familiar compan- 
ion. 

“It was a rough trip. They 
brought you up to a light sleep 
several times and questioned you 
about your mission.” 

“Did they learn anything?” 
asked Zuliani. 

He could remember nothing 
that would indicate that this was 
anything other than a scout 
mission. Perhaps the post- 
hypnotic suggestion would clarify 
everything — but so far he drew 
a blank. His mind was a vacuum 
after his self-induced trance. 

His belt continued: “When they 
started probing your mind I got 
so worried that my anxiety circuits 
must have overheated. Tliey 
detected me and took me away. 
I don’t know what happened the 
rest of the trip. How is your 
memory? Any big voids?” 

. “No. I don’t think so. I guess 
they are pretty refined with their 
erasing. Or else they didn’t find 
anything worth erasing,” said 
Zuliani. “How does the starship 
check out?” 

“Fine,” said the belt. “A servo 

91 




took me through the hull. Plenty 
of Earth genes are represented in 
the suspension tanks — plants, 

animals, even microorganisms. 
But no humans.” 

”The Clicks and Dregs were 
that thorough? I’m the only hu- 
man on board?” asked Zuliani. 
“Yes.” 

“Well, I wonder what the col- 
onel had in mind.” 

“All you need is a source of 
female genes. There isn’t any skin 
under your fingernails, is there?” 
asked the belt — half in jest. 

“No.” Zuliani smiled. “But the 
cells would have to be alive and 
capable of division in our Tat- 
tering apparatus. No sense in 
searching for secret compartments 
in my sword or other gear either. 
Outside of suspension the Dreg’s 
faster-than-light drive would have 
killed any cytoplasmic units they 
might have carried.” 

They rechecked the gear and 
his outlandish costume. Nothing. 
He began to notice a number of 
unexpected aches and pains as the 
rewarming drugs wore off, so he 
settled down in his control couch 
to rest — and think. 

“Message from the Dregs,” an- 
nounced the ship. 

“I’ll take it here,” he said and 
turned toward the viewscreen. 

“Qick, click. Have a nice 
scouting trip. Don’t forget to send 
your message torpedo back to 
Procyon. We wouldn’t want them 
to worry.’* 



“Can we answer that?” asked 
Zuliani. 

“Probably,” replied the ship. 
“We’re still under light-speed one. 
But there is no need to. If we 
send the torpedo they’ll detect its 
trail through their system.” 

Zuliani considered not sending 
it. That would upset the military 
and raise doubts about the Dregs’ 
good intentions. Perhaps it would 
lay the groundwork for a future 
space war. Well, he’d send it. Play 
by the rules and see what hap- 
pens. 

After the ship filled the 
torpedo’s memory banks he added 
a postscript with some of his 
suspicions and sent it back. 

Z ULIANI floated in the Tatter- 
ing section while the machine 
harvested his buffy coat for cell 
cultures. About half a pint of his 
blood went through the separator, 
which removed his white blood 
cells. The red cells and plasma 
were transfused back. The buffy 
layer — a light yellow-white mix- 
ture of plasma and white 
cells — was suspended for future 
embryogenesis. About three 
ounces a day were harvested. 

He tried to be cheerful. “We 
can start a monogenetic line and 
build a civilization that rivals the 
Dregs,” he said. 

“Unfortunately that isn’t possi- 
ble,” said the starship. “A cell 
line can not replicate indefinitely. 
After about fifty or a hundred 

IF 



92 




doublings the cell line dies out 
of old age. Each nucleus seems 
to have a molecular clock that 
ticks off the cell divisions. When 
an organism uses up its ticks — it 
dies. Sexual reproduction is need- 
ed to make a new organism with 
a new clock.” 

He looked at the ship's optic 
pickup. 

“But how do the Dregs 

manage? he asked. 

“A hundred doublings, more or 
less, still gives you billions of in- 
dividual cells. By using three- 

fourths of the doublings to make 
cell cultures they've grown a 
massive supply of genetic units. 

But that leaves only one-fourth 
of the doublings for each individ- 
ual’s life span — and you prob- 
ably noticed that all the Dregs 
were under thirty. That is about 
a fourth of the usual human life 
span. However, there is evidence 
that they are getting to the end 
of their material. The Clicks will 
soon have to adopt a few humans 
or go on working without 
biological units for pets,” said the 
ship. 

Zuliani doubted that many hu- 
mans would accept the Clicks on 
the same terms the Dregs had. 
But then, the Dregs were quite 
sterile and had no alternative. 

^ /f' ESSAGE coming in.” 

IVJL “Click, click, Symbiot,” 
said the Meck-angel over the 
viewscreen. 



The appellation depressed Zu- 
liani, but that was what he had 
become — a symbiot. A human 
alone in intergalactic space, away 
from his species and dependent 
on machines for asexual repro- 
duction. 

Then the alien machine shuck- 
ed its angular jaw. Its voice lost 
its metallic quality as a 
featureless, egg-shaped “head” 
drifted up from the silent husk 
of its robot facade. 

“Go on to the next galaxy and 
explore. Live with your machines, 
Symbiot. But go knowing that you 
failed to deceive us. We removed 
your uterus and ovaries, so you 
can’t contaminate Andromeda 
with your primitive race,” said the 
alien. 

Zuliani didn’t understand. 

The message continued : 
“Foolish, Our technicians knew 
that your steroid treatment was 
a protective cover for a graft, but 
female sex organs were so ob- 
vious! But a hermaphroditic space 
scout would be your race’s answer 
to the problem we have of- 
fered — reflecting the ingenuous- 
ness of a race that has been in 
space only a few centuries — ” 

The message became frag- 
mented as their acceleration car- 
ried them up into light-speed and 
the cone of blackness blotted out 
the center of the screen. 

Zuliani palpated his abdomen. 
Syntheskin still covered his body, 
sprayed on to protect him from 

93 



STAR SEEDER 




friction during his suspension. A 
tender spot below the umbilicus? 
Masked by the generalized aches 
and pains of rewarming and hid- 
den under the syntheskin, he 
found the small incision in his 
lower abdomen. So that was it! 
The colonel must have bungled 
the posthypnotic suggestion, but 
he could imagine what it had 
been. Fill the sperm banks 
first — since the same body can't 
produce both eggs and sperm at 
the same time. Then with a heavy 
dose of estrogens he could bring 
the infantile uterus and ovaries to 
maturity in a few years to provide 
the eggs. Basic biology. Almost 
too basic. The Clicks had 
discovered it and thwarted him. 
Mankind would have to wait a 
while longer before it could go 
Out Galaxy. 

Depressed, he w^ent back into 
suspension to wait out the long 
trip. 

M any years later the starship 
orbited a likely looking star 
in the Rim of Andromeda. There 
were two planets to choose from, 
both Earthlike. The Tattering 
systems activated. Mobile surface 
units were put on both planets 
to compare the environments. The 
nearer planet finally was select- 
ed and Zuliani was rewarmed. 

His memory was intact and he 
was still depressed by his defeat 
at the hands of the Clicks. Then 
a cold fear dampened his axillae 

94 



and bleached out his adrenals. 
The Tattering apparatus contained 
males and females — fetuses of all 
sizes and colors. 

“That is a Click trick — hor- 
mones, dye. What am I on? A 
Click ship?” he asked. 

His belt reassured him: “This 
isn’t a Click ship. I would know. 
Take me to the Tattering con- 
trols.” 

He studied the controls. His 
belt’s optic pickup focused on the 
readouts. 

“No overriding hormone con- 
trols here. Those fetuses are 
developing with their own hor- 
mones and genes,” said the belt. 

“But those were my cells. I’m 
not a mosaic. I’m just one indivi- 
dual,” he protested. 

The starship activated a 
viewscreen in front of them and 
projected the standard list of 
1,034 genetic types of Earth hu- 
mans. 

“These red arrows indicate the 
genetic types we have already 
identified in the incubators. Red 
dots are probables — yellow dots 
are possibles. Apparently your 
bloodstream was filled with the 
Rainbow Mix of white cells just 
prior to suspension. With an um- 
brella of steroids to prevent rejec- 
tion most of the cells survived 
and are now producing daughter 
cells. You have acquired 
mosaicism,” said the ship. 

“What will that do to me?” 
he asked apprehensively. 



IF 




“Nothing. We’ll harvest buffy 
coat for a couple weeks and then 
stop the steroids. After that, your 
own antibodies will clean your 
system of any foreign cells,” said 
the ship. 

Zuliani smiled. The Rainbow 
Mix — designed for suspension- 
storage in the Tattering ap- 
paratus — but evidently capable of 
setting up a limited kind of 
“housekeeping” in the vascular 
spaces of his spleen, lymph nodes 
and marrow. He’d get rid of them 
before they got a good hold on 
his marrow. He didn’t want them 
to reject him. But meanwhile, they 
represented mankind. 



T he human race had come to 
Andromeda in the body of 
Zuliani. Now it was poised on 
the rim of that Galaxy — poised 
and ready to pounce — spreading 



babies, the picnic litter of civiliza- 
tion throughout the star systems. 

Zuliani walked from the corn- 
field into the Meek nursery, 
brushing pollen from his 
shoulders. As he waded among 
the smiling faces, distributing pats 
and wwds of encouragement, he 
reflected on their rainbow skin 
colors: reds, whites, browns, 

yellows. Outwitting the Dregs with 
mosaicism had been easy, for the 
Dregs were really a clone 
race — monogenetic. Single genetic 
pattern and single antigenic pat- 
tern. Their cells and organs were 
freely interchangeable between 
individuals. But, because the 
transplanted tissue lost its donor 
identity in the Dregs they had 
no way of detecting it — therefore 
they couldn’t even understand the 
theory of human mosaicism. 

And therefore humanity would 
soon own another galaxy. •

PHILIP ST. JOHN 



K eir Soth lifted his eyes weari- 
ly from the tattered fragment 
of a book he was trying to read 
as he heard the gritty cycle of 
the airlock. He sighed and rose 
to his feet to stare through the 
left vision port at the alien 
landscape beyond the ship. 



Melok was a harsh world. Even 
at sunset it showed no softening 
of the raw desert that ran directly 
to the ugly brick towers of the 
city to Keir’s right. The sky was 
dull with a thin overcast of dust 
and haze. Three miles away most 
of the red sun was hidden- by

error. Religion worships 
the truth. Between 
must lie — confusion! 

the immense pyramid that was the 
native temple. Already there was 
a yellow wash of light glowing 
from an opening in the fane. 

Por Dain came into the control 
room to stand beside him. The 
scientist was older than Keir and 
slightly shorter but they might 
have been brothers from their 
looks. Both were normally dark 
of complexion and abnormally 
lean and sharp of features. Por 
Dain had removed his protective 
garment but sand and grit still 
clung to the creases around his 
eyes. Fatigue from the double 
gravity of Melok showed in the 
droop of his shoulders. 

“Five thousand light-years of 
searching space in this can,” he 
muttered. “Then, less than thirty 
parsecs from home we find — this. 
By Earth, Tm tired of all these 
superstitious savages and their tin 
god!” 

'Keir Soth winced at the oath, 
reaching out to touch the tiny 
emblem that represented a 
hemisphere of lost Earth. He was 
noti t>f course, superstitious. But 
childhood habits were hard to 
break. 



Por Dain snorted. “Can't you 
get it through your head there’s 
no truth to the legend, Keir? 
How could any planet wrap itself 
in a silver haze and then just 
disappear — supposedly into some 
mystic higher dimension — to leave 
its colonies stranded? Tommyrot!” 

“But we found the picture of 
just such a happening on that 
world in the third quandrant,” the 
captain protested. 

“A world that had been barren 
of human life for at least twenty 
thousand years,” Por Dain re- 
minded him. “Do you think our 
legend would have lasted that 
long?'’ 

Keir Soth shook his head reluc- 
tantly. There were legends of 
some great w^ar in the heavens 
that had blasted civilizations back 
some fifteen hundred years — and 
those were probably true. There 
was even evidence that Melok 
itself might have been the enemy 
world, since it had been rendered 
almost lethally radioactive at the 
same time. Its atmosphere still 
contained more radiation than 
Keir found comfortable to think 
of. But a legend older than twenty 
millennia. .? 

And there were other puzzles. 
If men had been colonizing worlds 
so long ago, why were there no 
ancient and advanced worlds? Did 
every planet rise to spew out col- 
onies and then die in some new 
holocaust of war with those colo- 
nies? Was life so stupid? 



THE LAST TRUE SOD

L yssa the Novitiate came into 
the cabin then, bringing broth 
and platters of rations for them. 
She was quite typical of her 
kind — blond as no other women 
were, slight, resembling a porce- 
lain doll. The girls who served 
Earth were carefully bred to look 
alike. 

Surprisingly, For Dain made 
room for her on his seat. The 
old agnostic usually avoided her, 
bitter at the law forcing all ships 
to carry at least one Novitiate. 
She smiled her usual pleasant and 
empty smile at him as she began 
the evening invocation in the an- 
cient speech. 

'' 'F / forgethce Ozinc. , .** 

“She did fine today,'’ For Dain 
admitted when he saw Keifs 
questioning look. “She talked that 
high priest Shaggoth into letting 
her up by that Earth-damned tin 
god of theirs and she planted three 
pickups.” 

She made the circle of Earth 
but the blasphemy didn't seem to 
bother her. 

“Shaggoth calls it the last true 
god,” Lyssa said. 

She had been uncomplaining 
throughout the voyage. After find- 
ing the pieces of books on the 
ancient planet, she had even begun 
teaching them the ancient tongue. 
That had proved fortunate, since 
the natives of Mclok also used 
it for their ritual and Shaggoth 
spoke it enough like Lyssa’s 
version to be understood. She'd 



proved helpful enough on the 
voyage. Besides, men needed a 
woman on a long trip. 

Why Shaggoth seemed to accept 
her was another puzzle about this 
dratted world. He had been rough 
enough on For and Kier, forbid- 
ding them to come within three 
hundred feet of his fane. And 
he had refused to let even the 
girl see his sacred books, though 
he made no secret of their ex- 
istence. The scholars back on 
Homework! would give a dozen 
fortunes for the legends of any 
alien world, too! 

It was dark outside — except 
for the red light of Mclok's four 
visible moons — when For Dain 
finished his food and sttx>d up 
to ti7 the tricky outside recep- 
tors. The old man's hands shook 
with fatigue as he tuned them. 
Then he grunted with pleasure and 
surprise. He had been tinkering 
with the receptors for weeks — and 
now at last one seemed to be 
working properly. It showed the 
inside of the temple clearly. Shag- 
goth was fussing about with bits of 
wire, making happy sounds. The 
high prievSt was a dark, hairy man, 
grotesquely short and ugly. There 
was something indecent about his 
expression and his chuckling. 

Then the focus cleared for 
depth. For the first time, the two 
men saw the god worshiped on 
Melok. 

“A robot!” Kier exclaimed. “A 
robot like the legends in the books 

IF

from the ruined planet.” 

Por Dain ncxlded slowly. 
“Looks like it. I knew it was 
metal — yet how ean it be? Metal 
would have gone to pieces by 
now. It must be some kind of 
statue shaped of tin and made 
to look like the robots their 
legends described. These savages 
are worshipping a machine.” 

I I WAS an ancient piece in any 
event. Dust and grime had been 
polished from it but there was 
an unmistakable patina of cen- 
turies. It was vaguely manlike, 
though its face gained the touch 
of nobility without any definite 
features. 

“Maybe it is the wreck of a 
real robot,” Por decided. ”lf the 
ancients before the bombing here 
had some of our alloys — it could 
be. Now there's religion for 
you, Kcir. A race of men blindly 
w'orshipping something they made 
for a servant.” 

Lyssa touched the Earth 
emblem but her smile remained 
unchanged. She no longer pro- 
tested Por's remarks. Instead she 
pointed to Shaggoth, who was 
blowing out the torch and turning 
down the gas mantles. 

“He’s coming here,” she said. 
In that she was right. The 
pickup showed him moving across 
the sand toward them, badly 
distorted but recognizable. 

Por had turned the gain up 
enough to see by the dim temple 

THE LAST TRUE GOD 



lights. He caught Kier’s attention 
and began tracing the thing Shag- 
goth had been working on. 

It was a weirdly wired mess 
of coils and blocks of some kind, 
seemingly directed toward their 
ship. Por pointed out where the 
wires led from it and were cither 
stuck on the robot body or 
somehow plugged in. 

“Must be a mockup of some 
machine from tlie legends,” Kicr 
guessed. “Ritual magic — similarity 
principle. But docs he think some 
kind of god power is still gen- 
erated in that creature?” 

“There’s always power in the 
god,” Lyssa informed them. 
“Shaggoth has bragged of it. He 
makes miracle fires with it.” 

Any power in those batteries 
had been dead for millennia, Kicr 
realized. But a clever priest could 
fake something to convince his 
followers. 

“Maybe he's coming here to 
warn us he’s making big medicine 
and we’re in his power,” Por 
guessed. 

Lyssa shook her head, her smile 
deepening slightly. “He’s coming 
to sec me. He asked me today. I 
think he wants to be converted 
to the blessed lost-Eartli faith.'’ 
“You’re not going out. Lyssa,'’ 
Kier told her sharply. “And you’re 
not letting him in.” He flipped 
a toggle to cut in the hull pickups. 
Around the ship were some fifty 
partly concealed figures waiting 
patiently, as they had wailed every 

^9 




night. “That’s an order. Lyssa. 
Stay away from the airlock until 
morning.” 

She nodded faintly, then more 
firmly at his expression. “All 
right,” she agreed softly, though 
her smile was almost gone. “Good 
night, then. I'll sleep now.” 

They heard her sounds of final 
prayers and the faint noise of her 
body sinking into the hammock 
in her tiny room. After a while 
Por Da in also retired. 

K niR sat watching the high 
priest. Shaggoth reached the 
ship and knocked softly. Then he 
squatted down in the sand, mo- 
tionless and patient. Kier waited 
but nothing else happened. And 
finally he released his control scat 
and sank onto it. The last sounds 
he heard were the heavy breathing 
of Por Dain and L.yssa's faintly 
adenoidal snores. 

A heavy hand on his shoulder 
shook him back to consciousness. 
Por Dain stood over him, scowling 
and swearing. 

“She's gone! The Earth-damned 
crusading little fool — she pulled 
a sneak and they're all gone.” 
Kier snapped out of his stupor. 
By the clock, six hours of the 
long Melok night had passed since 
he fell asleep. He saw that the 
outside hull pickups were on, 
showing no sign of the natives 
or of Shaggoth. 

“We’ve got to get out and res- 



cue her,” he muttered thickly, 
reaching for the caffein tablets. 

“No chance. Holy Earth, look 
at them!” 

Por Dain had turned the pick- 
ups toward the temple and the 
distorted one showed an enormous 
crowd of Melok natives streaming 
from the city and mounting 
toward their fane. 

Then the one good pickup 
caught Shaggoth as the priest 
moved into view. Gas jets were 
now casting a half-light over the 
temple, and the priest was again 
busy with his wired contraption. 

“Damn him,” Por growled. “He 
isn't as ignorant as I thought. That 
savage is tuning a circuit, looks 
like. Ah!” 

As he spoke, the contraption 

seemed to come to life. A blue 
glow ran over the coils and turned 
white. It seemed to spread like 

a spark climbing a Jacob’s ladder. 
Then it was a faint glow of 
spherical shape that stretched and 
grew too thin to see. 

Then acolytes appeared, bear- 
ing Lyssa. She was trussed firmly 
but seemed unharmed. She made 
no sound but her smile was gone. 
Her eyes, wide and round with 

fear, were centered on Shaggoth. 

A chanting began as the 

acolytes laid her on a stone block 
before their last true god. Shag- 
goth approached her, holding two 
wands from which wires led to 
the robot's body.

IF 




K eir Soth found himself 
blaspheming heavily as he 
reached for the weapons in a 
drawer of the control panel. 

But Ror Dain held him back. 
“Don’t be a fool, Captain. It’s 
a bluff. He wants us to come 
out to rescue her. That’s his whole 
plan. Then he’ll have the ship. 
There must be a horde of the 
savages waiting below the hull 
where we can’t pick them up.” 
“Then we’ll take the ship 
there.” 

“No.” Anger mingled with 
reluctant respect in For Dain’s 
.expression. “I recognize that field 
he’s generating now from the 
layout of parts. We’ve got one 
like it on Homeworld — only no 
bigger than a pea yet at maxi- 
mum. You can’t get through. It 
would damp the engines half a 
mile before we reached the 
pyramid.” 

No wonder the priest had 
refused to let them see the ancient 
books. He must have a technical 
library there — and somehow the 
old faker comprehended what was 
in them, however little he used 
them for the good of his followers. 

Shaggoth was staring directly 
into the pickup, as if aware that 
they could see him. Now he 
brought the wands into contact 
with Lyssa’s body, smiling thickly 
as she screamed. 

Keir began warming the 
engines. “I’ll take the ship in as 
close as we dare,” he said. “Then 

THE LAST TRUE GOD 



we get out and kill as many as 
we can trying to reach her.” 

For Dain began loading the 
weapons as the engines warmed. 

Again Shaggoth brought the 
insulated wands against the Novi- 
tiate's body. Her muscles tensed 
in a wild spasm but the savage 
chant rose to cover any cries she 
made. 

The ship was just beginning to 
respond, rising sluggishly. Keir 
grinned thinly, hoping a horde of 
Melok natives were caught under 
that pressure field. The ship 
couldn’t yet operate well but 
power was building up. 

Again Melok brought down the 
wands. And this time the chant 
quieted. 

“Help me — ” Hers was a cry 
that should have torn the heart 
from a brazen idol. “For the love 
of Earth, help me — ” 

And help came. 

T he robot figure moved. A 
metal arm swung down to 
tear the wires free from its body. 
Slowly, ponderously, the figure 
straightened. There was a creaking 
sound as the limbs moved, and 
dirt and scale chipped away. Then 
it was erect. 

In two strides the metal figure 
had caught the frozen priest and 
broken him like a thin stick across 
one knee. Shaggoth was flung back 
into the mob of screaming, fleeing 
worshippers. 

For a moment the robot halted. 

101 




staring toward Lyssa. It sank to 
one knee. Shaggoth was flung 
gesture of some kind. A bass voice 
sounded over the pickup, using 
an oddly pure-sounding form of 
the ancient tongue. 

“Saintly One, I — “ 

The words cut off as the robot 
bent closer. Then something like 
a sigh came from it. It stood 
up quietly, moving to snap the 
bindings away from Lyssa’s limbs. 
She lay limp. The metal arms 
reached under her to lift her. 

The robot turned then, facing 
away from the pickup for a long 
minute, its head up as if listening. 
Again there was a sigh. 

“The field is too strong,” the 
even bass voice said in the ancient 
tongue. The figure turned, 
searching until it located the 
pickup. 

“1 go by another way.” the 
robot said slowly and carefully. 
“Your lady is safe but you who 
are in the ship must wait until 
I appear again.” 

It turned quickly toward the 
throne on which it had sat. A 
foot reached out to kick the 
massive structure aside, while a 
hand made a pass through the 
air. Almost instantly, an opening 
appeared in what had seemed 
solid rock. The robot stepped into 
it, carrying the Novitiate, and 
disappeared. Immediately after it 
was gone the rock closed tightly. 
A small explosion seemed to take 
place inside. 

102 



Keir had the ship up but now 
there was no place to go. “Wait 
until he appears where?” he asked 
bitterly. “Or until he can get 
safely hidden away witj? her in 
some hole in the ground?” 

“Try cruising slowly toward the 
pyramid,” Por Dain suggested. 
“Maybe there’s a secret shaft out 
to the bottom and he’ll show up 
there.” 

“He’d better.” 



B efore the ship was in full 
motion, however, they saw the 
robot again. This time he was 
only a dot on their screen until 
Por raised the magnification of 
the hull pickup. He stood threQ 
miles from the pyramid on a nar- 
row ledge of the most ancient 
of the brick structures. Lyssa was 
still unconscious in his arms. 
Somehow he had traveled that 
distance in less than five minutes. 
Now he stood staring into space, 
as if listening to a voice from 
the stars. 

Then his head dropped. “So 
long?” he asked. “Fifteen hundred 
years from the radiation that 
paralyzed my mind until the right 
words could waken me?” He 
sighed again and seemed to listen 
once more. He nodded slightly 
and turned to face the ship. From 
the receiver of the now useless 
temple pickup a softer and warm- 
er voice spoke, using standard 
Homeworld speech. “Bring your 

IF 




ship close to me and open your 
airlock. I will leap across. And 
do not fear. I shall be the Watcher 
for Homeworld now, since these 
people have forfeited all right to 
one.” 

Keir Soth manipulated the ship 
very delicately across the small 
distance while Por Dain went 
down to the airlock. It was tricky 
maneuvering but Keir had time 
enough to see a series of small 
explosions running like a mole’s 
trail from the pyramid across the 
desert to the big brick building. 
Whatever secret way the robot 
had known was destroyed now. 

The metal figure leaped when 
the ship was fifty feet away. Keir 
flinched and held his breath. Then 
he heard the lock cycling to full 
space closure and the robot came 
into the control room, with Lyssa 
conscious and smiling her pleasant 
and empty smile beside him. Por 
Dain stood in the doorway as 
the robot glanced around at the 
controls. 



“I have brought the few books 
from here that you can use,” the 
robot said, pointing to a small 
sack Por Dain was holding. 
“There is no need to wait here 
longer.” 

He slipped confidently into the 
captain’s chair, reaching for the 
controls. With unerring accuracy 
he plotted the course toward 
Homeworld and the ship began 
its gradual acceleration into the 
red sky and toward space. 

Keir Soth shook his head, be- 
numbed by wonder. “How could 
Melok have lost any war if they 
could create robots like you?” 

The Watcher looked back at 
the three humans and his voice 
was soft but filled with immense 
pride. “I was never created on 
Melok,” he said. “I came from 
Earth!” 

There was only the soft drone 
of the ship’s engines as Lyssa and 
Keir Soth slipped to their knees, 
to be followed a moment later 
by a former agnostic, Por Dain. •

THE 

STORY 



OF 

OUR 
EARTH 




1. How Long Is the Post? 



#News of the sudden untimely 
passing of Willy Ley has reached 
us just as we go to press. His 
death shocks the worlds of science 
and science fiction. He leaves 
an empty place in the hearts of 
his co-workers and friends, a 
place no other can fill— for 
Willy Ley was unique. 

In his honor, and because of 
its interest and significance, 
we shall publish posthumously 
that portion of his new series 
with which he has supplied us. 

It concerns the Earth's geologic 
history, the emergence of life, 
and its fascinating evolution in 
multiple forms— including man. 

104 



O NCE upon a time much of 
North America was covered 
by glaciers. At an earlier time 
the central portion of the North 
American continent had been 
flooded — with “sea serpents” in 
the water and “flying dragons” 
overhead. And before that, lux- 
urious but strange jungles grew 
in Pennsylvania, leaving coal 
seams behind. Before that there 
was a time when the land was 
devoid of life. And once upon 
a time the earth did not exist. 

First question — what does 
“once upon a time” mean in 
years? In plain language — how 
old is the earth? 



who knew? For two centuries 
or so there was a traditional 
answer. Didn’t it say in the margin 
of the Authorized Version of the 
Bible that the world had been 
created in 4004 B.c.? Most of the 
people who quoted the figure 
knew that it had been supplied by 
the Irish archbishop James Ussher 
(1581-1656), however very few 
knew how it had been established. 
What the good Ussher had done 
was to add up the genealogies 
given in the Old Testament but 
since the statements are often not 
very explicit quite a number of 
assumptions had to be made. 

For that reason the Roman 
Catholic Church disapproved of 
the method. And Jews and Ger- 
man Lutherans said that rabbi 
Shemayah Hillel, a pupil of the 
High Rabbi Loew of Prague — he, 
who is said to have made the 
Golem — had done the same about 
a hundred years earlier and had 
done it better. 

At any rate, Ussher and the 
Jewish calendar do not agree. Ac- 
cording to the Jewish calendar, it 
is now 5730 years since Creation 
while according to Ussher it 
should be 5973. 

Leaving theological thinking 
behind we can now progress to 
a man who thought that it should 
be possible to calculate the age 
of the earth. He was a French 
count who was in addition an ex- 
cellent mathematician, who had 
translated the works of Sir Isaac 

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



Newton into French and who was 
also an all-around naturalist, 
usually referred to as Buffon. His 
full name was Georges Louis 
Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and he 
lived from 1707 to 1788. 

His reasoning was that the 
earth must have been a part of 
the sun at some time and after 
it had been split off the sun (by 
a glancing blow of a large comet, 
he thought) it naturally was hot. 
Now it was no longer hot, at 
least not at the surface. How long 
would it take a sphere of metals 
and rocks the size of the earth 
to cool off from “very hot” to 
the present temperature? 

To find the answer he ordered 
a number of spheres made. They 
were all of the same size but 
of different materials — iron, 
brass, copper and various kinds 
of rocks. Next he had a number 
of wire holders prepared. The 
spheres rested in these, making 
minimum contact with anything 
but the atmosphere. After that he 
had a blacksmith heat all these 
spheres in his furnace, with orders 
to run the furnace as hot as he 
possibly could. When the spheres 
were hot they were placed in the 
wireholders and Buffon sat, watch 
in hand and waited for them to 
cool off. Every once in a while 
he would touch them, first with 
a gloved hand, then, when it 
seemed safe, with his fingers. 
Each time he wrote down how 
many minutes had elapsed. The 

105 




most important times were when 
his fingers could just stand the 
heat of the spheres and when he 
could not longer perceive a dif- 
ference between the temperatures 
of the spheres and the temperature 
in the room. 

Then he started calculating, 
trying to apply the cooling times 
he had found to a ball of rock 
the size of the earth. He found 
that the whole cooling period 
would amount to 74,832 years 
for the earth. About 25,000 years 
ago the earth had cooled off 
enough to be touched and Buffon 
assumed that life had appeared 
about then. 

Any high school physics student 
of today can think of a number 
of flaws in the experiment. For 
example any temperature which 
did not even melt the metals ob- 
viously was not high enough. And 
the spheres were cooled by both 
radiation and convection, while a 
hot planet in space would cool 
off by radiation alone. But Buf- 
fon’s experiment had its value as 
an attempt at actually measuring 
the age of the earth. And at least 
it showed that that age had to 
be expressed in tens of thousands 
of years. 

T he next attempt to calcu- 
late the age of the earth was 
not made until 1860. Geologists 
had been busy in the meantime. 
Austria, France, Germany and 
Russia had their share of 



geologists during the early part 
of the nineteenth century but 
England and especially Scotland 
provided an unusually high num- 
ber. Many of the latter were 
amateurs in the sense that they 
did not get paid for their 
geological explorations. But they 
were good amateurs. More by 
coincidence than for any other 
reason, many were churchmen. 

They first established that some 
layers of rock were older than 
others. The rocks of Wales seem- 
ed to be especially old and came 
to be referred to as Cambrian, 
for Cambria is the Latin name 
of Wales. The famous chalk cliffs 
were indubitably younger than the 
rocks of Wales but older than 
certain layers of sandstone. A 
nice, simple theory was pro- 
mulgated: the Primary Period was 
examplified by the Cambrian, the 
Secondary Period by the chalk 
cliffs. The Tertiary Period was 
the time during which these 
sandstone layers had formed. 

Unfortunately the simple theory 
did not hold up for long. 

There was coal. Lots of 
coal — its formation must have 
covered a period of its own. Next 
some German geologists said that 
the Jura mountains of southwest 
Germany and Switzerland did not 
fit into the basic scheme — the 
theory had to be revamped, espe- 
cially after Jurassic formations 
had been discovered in England, 
too. By a happy coincidence the 

IF 



106 




new scheme held six geological 
periods and, of course, the amateur 
geologists — remember that quite a 
considerable number of them were 
clergymen — thought this a fine 
agreement with the “days of crea- 
tion” of Genesis. The new scheme 
looked as follows: 

1. Laurentian Period — by defini- 
tion the oldest 

2. Cambrian Period — now the 
second oldest 

3. Carboniferous Period — the time 
when the coal seams had been 
formed; the name comes from 
carbo, Latin for “coal” 

4. Jurassic Period — after some 
discussion conceded to be older 
than the chalk cliffs 

5. Cretaceous Period — the time 
the chalk cliffs were formed; the 
name comes from creta, Latin for 
“chalk” 

6. Tertiary Period — the youngest 
of all, which kept its name even 
though it did not make any sense 
any more 

Not much later the Russians 
started publishing papers that 
showed that the rocks in the 
Russian District of Perm did not 
fit into the scheme since these 
Permian rocks seemed to be older 
than the German Jurassic rocks 
but probably were not old enough 
to belong to the Carboniferous 
Period. 

Whether there had been six or 
seven or even more geological 
periods was a minor question by 

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



comparison to problem of how 
long it took for these periods to 
follow each other. Nobody men- 
tioned the 4004 B.c. date any- 
more except in some rural areas 
where few people read and 
knowledge was word of mouth 
from generation to generation. But 
how much time had truly elapsed? 
The German physicist Hermann 
von Helmholtz (1821-1894) had 
established an upper limit based 
on the “fused” theory of the origin 
of the solar system by Immanuel 
Kant (1724-1804) and Pierre Si- 
mon, Marquis de Laplace (1749- 
1827). 

Their ingenious theory assumed 
that the solar system had really 
begun as a diffuse cloud of cosmic 
dust and gases. This cosmic cloud 
was to contract slowly by the mu- 
tual gravitational attraction of the 
gas molecules and particles. As 
it contracted it grew hot, especial- 
ly the central condensation that 
was to become the sun. The 
rapidly rotating sun was then sup- 
posed to have produced the 
planets one by one, by throwing 
off a ring of matter that had 
formed around its equator because 
of the fast rotation. The whole 
idea was discarded later but when 
von Helmholtz did his work no 
doubts had yet been uttered. 

Hermann von Helmholtz ap- 
proached the problem as 
systematically as possible. The 
sun shone and threw vast amounts 
of energy into space every mo- 

107 




ment. That energy had to come 
from somewhere and the only 
source Helmholtz could think off 
was contraction — a major part of 
the theory. This continued con- 
traction because of the mutual at- 
traction of the molecules meant 
that the sun was gaining density 
at every moment. Calculation said 
that after another 17 million years 
the sun would have contracted as 
much as it possibly could. Then 
it would radiate its heat away 
into space and would stop shining. 
But the geologists were not so 
much interested in the 17 million 
years of sunshine to come — they 
wanted to know what had gone 
before. 

In the past the sun had been 
less dense and had, therefore, 
taken up a larger volume of space. 
Considering the rate of shrinkage 
that von Helmholtz had al- 
ready calculated, the diameter of 
the sun must have been 186 
million miles 50 million years ago. 
One hundred eighty six million 
miles is the diameter of the earth’s 
orbit. This meant that the earth 
could not possibly be older than 
50 million years. Actually it had 
to be younger — how much 
younger remained to be seen. 

By 1 890 the geologists had nine 
geological periods on their lists 
but their estimates of the duration 
of these periods were mainly 
guesswork. They had two clues. 
One of which was evolution — - 
pretty generally accepted by 

108 



then — while the other was “rate of 
sedimentation.” All one could say 
definitely about evolution was that 
it must have taken a long time. 
Nobody could tell at what rate 
evolution progressed and it was 
doubtful even then that the rate 
was consistent. We now know that 
at some times in the geological 
past evolution proceeded at a sur- 
prisingly fast rate, while there 
seem to have been long periods 
during which the picture did not 
change much. 

Nor was the rate of sedimenta- 
tion more helpful. 

Of course one could observe 
how much sand and mud a given 
river would deposit in a bay per 
year. One could establish how 
much of the yearly total had 
been deposited in late spring and 
how little in winter. Then, having 
found that the average was half 
an inch per year one could be 
quite close to the truth if one 
assumed that the half inch of sand 
and mud would make a layer of 
sandstone slightly less than a tenth 
of an inch in thickness by being 
compressed into stone. And it was 
then a question of elementary 
arithmetic to calculate how many 
years had been needed to deposit 
a 250-foot thickness of a 
sandstone layer. Unfortunately 
different rivers perform at dif- 
ferent rates, depending on the rate 
of flow of the river as it fought 
its way to the sea — and also on 
the material along the course of 

IP 




the river. Estimates of how much 
time was required to form a given 
deposit were simply estimates. 

Moreover, if an area had been 
flooded and sediments had formed 
and it subsequently became dry 
land — only to be flooded again 
after some time, the number of 
years for that “some time" were 
not even an estimate but just a 
guess. Small wonder that different 
books by different and respected 
experts gave figures for the same 
phenomenon that had nothing in 
common, except for the fact that 
they represented vast ages com- 
pared to the human life span. 
Some time ago [ found a beautiful 
example, two estimates of the age 
of the black slate in which a fossil 
reptile (Ichthyosaurus) occurs. It 
had been found off the British 
coast (Isle of Wight) and, in 
much larger quantity, in 
southwest Germany. One estimate 
was an age of two million years 
and the other was five or six 
million years. Now if one of these 
estimates had been about the 
British deposits and the other 
about the German deposits one 
might consider that the different 
localities somehow played a role. 
But both estimates referred to the 
German deposits in Swabia. 

P eople who were not geolo- 
gists regarded even these fig- 
ures with a mixture of alarm and 
contempt. A teacher of mine often 
related the story that he had taken 

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



a course in ancient history at the 
University of Heidelberg during 
the last decade of the nineteenth 
century. The historian had told 
his students that chronology was 
fine back to early Greece, say 
800 B.c. Of course Egypt, Assyria 
and Babylonia were older, though 
one could not say by how much. 

“All in all,’’ my teacher quoted 
him as saying, “history will add 
up to about 6000 years and that 
is what we do now. Now if you 
should ask a geologist you’ll hear 
that he counts in millions but that 
has nothing to do with science 
any more." 

And at that time geologists 
were timid indeed. The total 
duration of all geological periods, 
they said, might add up to ten 
million years. 

Interestingly enough, t h e 
discoveries that were to provide 
the answer were just being made 
at the time when my teacher’s 
history professor made his 
remarks about the “unscientific" 
behavior of the geologists. The 
discoveries were the ones that 
showed that an atom was not an 
indestructible and eternal super- 
tiny sphere of matter but 
something that had a structure, 
too. 

One day in 1901 at McGill 
University in Montreal, Canada, a 
discussion look place that has 
been partly preserved. The two 
men involved were Sir Ernest 
Rutherford (1871-1937) and 

109 




Frederick Soddy (1877-1956), 
who was a graduate of Oxford 
and had just joined forces with 
Rutherford. They studied the 
long-known element thorium 
which gave off what was then 
called “emanation.” First they 
found that that “emanation” did 
not come from thorium but from 
something else they called 
thorium-X. Then Soddy found 
that the emanation was a gas like 
argon — actually it was the 
radioactive gas radon which had 
not yet been discovered — and 
when he felt sure of the facts 
he said: “Rutherford, this is 

transmutation — the thorium is 
disintegrating and turning itself 
into an argon gas.” Rutherford 
did not doubt the facts either, 
but answered: “For Mike’s sake, 
Soddy, don’t call it transmutation! 
They'll have our heads off as 
alchemists.” So in their publica- 
tion they spoke of “sub-atomic 
chemical change.” 

An American, Bertram Borden 
Boltwood (1870-1927) believed 
Rutherford and Soddy and after 
a year or so of work announced 
that the parent substance seemed 
to be uranium. Uranium became 
radium after an intermediate stage 
and radium, going through several 
other stages, finally became lead, 
which is no longer radioactive, 
it must be remarked here that 
all the early descriptions are 
somewhat vague and full of names 
one can’t find in a handbook any 



more, because the concept of an 
isotope was still in the future. 
Isotopes are different versions of 
the same element that are 
chemically the same — but their 
atoms have slightly different 
weights. Since this idea had not 
yet occurred to anybody the early 
researchers believed each time 
when they had discovered a new 
isotope that they had discovered 
a new element. 

After Soddy had left Ruther- 
ford the latter acquired a new 
assistant: Otto Hahn (1879- 

1968), who was also interested 
in thorium and had discovered 
something which he called “radio- 
thorium.” In Canada he 
discovered “meso-thorium” which 
then turned out to be a mixture 
of meso-thorium 1 and meso- 
thorium 2. (Actually they all were 
just various thorium isotopes.) 
Hahn thought that there was in 
addition a second line of “natural 
transmutation,” beginning with 
thorium and also ending up as 
lead. Though he was an ac- 
complished chemist he did not 
succeed in detecting any dif- 
ference but still thought it prudent 
to speak of “radium-lead” and 
“thorium-lead.” 

W HILE these men still did 
not know about isotopes the 
very important concept of “half- 
life” had been evolved. Radioac- 
tive elements changed into other 
elements and that took time. But 



MO 



IF 




one could not speak about the 
“life-time” of a radio-active ele- 
ment, for that would depend on 
the amount you had. A large 
sample naturally lasted longer 
than a small sample. However, 
one could, regardless of the size 
of the sample, say that after so 
and so much time half of it would 
have changed into something 
else — hence half-life. It was found 
fairly fast that there was no way 
of influencing the half-life of a 
naturally radio-active element. It 
was also found that the half-lives 
of different elements were of dif- 
ferent lengths. 

A few samples (modern 
figures) must be given here to 
show how it works. Element no. 
85, astatine, of atomic weight 
210, has a half-life of 8 hours 
and 30 minutes. Element no. 89, 
actinium, of atomic weight 227, 
has a half-life of 22 years. Ele- 
ment no. 84, polonium, of atomic 
weight 209, has a half-life of 103 
years and element no. 88, radium, 
of atomic weight 226, has a half- 
life of 1620 years. 

These short half-lives could be 
established after a few days, or 
months, of observation — I should 
add here that astatine was not 
yet known. But when it came to 
uranium of atomic weight 238 
things were difficult — we now 
know that its half-life is 4500 
million years. But once it became 
apparent that the half-life of ura- 
nium had to be expressed in 

THE STORY OF OUR EARTH 



millions of years a clue to the 
age of the earth had been found. 
Look for uranium-bearing rocks. 
Check the percentage of uranium, 
then check on the percentages of 
other elements that are the 
“descendants” of uranium, mainly 
lead. And you know how old these 
rocks arc. Early figures which we 
know now to be too small were 
that way because at the time the 
half-life of uranium had still been 
underestimated. 

And that is why we know that 
those famous ichthyosaurs of 
Swabia enjoyed life not a million 
years ago or five million years 
ago — but 140 million years ago. 
Coal turned out to be about 300 
million years old. But the chalk 
cliffs could boast an age of only 
about 70 million years. 

In the meantime the geologists 
had rewritten their table of 
periods, going by their own 
evidence — the atomic scientists 
only added the proper age figures. 
The whole history of the earth, 
beginning with the first clear 
fossils, was subdivided into three 
eras. There was the Paleozoic Era 
that began 550 million years ago 
and lasted for 355 million years, 
comprising six geologic periods, 
named Cambrian, Ordovician, 
Silurian, Denovian, Lower Car- 
boniferous (Mississipian in the 
U.S.A.), Upper Carboniferous 
(Pennsylvanian in the U.S.A.) 
Permian. 

Then followed the Mesozoic 

III 




Era, beginning about 200 million 
years ago and lasting for 135-140 
million years. It comprised only 
Ihree geologic periods: Triassic, 
Jurassic and Cretaceous. 

The newest is the Cenozoic Era 
which began 60 million years ago. 
It is equivalent to the old Tertiary 
period which still bears that name 
and which has been divided into 
half a dozen sub-periods called 
Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, 
Miocene and Pliocene. Then came 
one million years of Pleistocene, 
otherwise known as the Jee Age 
which ended 1 1 ,000 years ago. 
And the second half of that small 
remainder is what is called 
“history.” 

T said a while ago that the 
geologists wrote their own table 
and that the atomic scientists only 
added figures. That is correct for 
the periods since the time of the 
earliest fossils. Where the atomic 
scientists did add something was 
at the front end, so to speak. 
Everything older than the Cam- 
brian period was logically called 
the Pre-Cambrian and its duration 
could not be guessed until dating 
by radioactivity proclaimed that 
some rocks had to be more than 
3000 million years old.* 



The Pre-Cambrian was then 
split into Lower and Upper Pre- 
Cambrian and a duration of 650 
million years was assigned to 
each. Subsequently this was in- 
creased to “750 million years or 
more” so that the beginning of 
the Lower Pre-Cambrian is now 
thought to have been 2000 million 
years in the past. 

By that time the earth was fully 
formed, with a solid surface, with 
liquid water filling depressions 
and with an atmosphere. That at- 
mosphere would not be to our 
liking — in fact it would kill us 
in about a minute — but it was 
an atmosphere. 

How long it took for the earth 
to be formed by accretion of cos- 
mic dust and gas is unknown, 
though the process is estimated 
to have taken around 3000 
million years. What is important 
is that at some time during the 
Pre-Cambrian life originated. • 



* T never say “billion” because a 
billion is 1000 million only in the 
United States. Anywhere else beginning 
with Canada and Mexico, a billion is 
a million million. Hence I prefer to 
talk of thousands of million, if 
necessary. There are enough interna- 
tional misunderstandings as it is. 





F or the past year one of the 
loudest literary controversies 
of science fiction has centered 
around a new novel by Norman 
Spinrad — one often encouraged by 
vigorous diatribes from Spinrad. 
Each step in its history was 
treated as a major disaster or 
triumph. 

The publisher who had con- 
tracted for the book rejected it 
upon its completion. Nobody 
wanted it until it was finally 
serialized in the British New 
Worlds, where the postal service 
tried to suppress it. After that, 
naturally, the American publishers 
began bidding for it. Spinrad held 
out for a contract that would 
guarantee to preserve every word 
exactly as he wrote it. Then at

last we learned that art had 
triumphed; a contract was signed. 

Now it is out in both soft-cover 
and hard-bound editions: Bug 

Jack Barron by Norman Spinrad 
(Avon, 950; Walker and Co., 
$5.95). Now you can read it for 
yourself and you can determine 
whether — according to the Avon 
jacket copy — it should be damned 
as “depraved” or hailed as a work 
of genius. Tf you do, you may 
wonder what all the shouting was 
about. 

Don’t expect to be shocked if 
you’ve been reading many of the 
current best-sellers. Compared to 
Harold Robbins’ Carpetbaggers, 
this will seem pretty tame. Aside 
from a heavy sprinkling of four-

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



BAT HARDIN is a peace of- 
ficer for New Woodstock, a small 
mobile artists* colony of trailers 
that is heading through Mexico 
toward South America, Many 




ko' 





people live in such towns now, 
most living off their Negative In- 
come Tax from the Welfare State, 
or Meritocracy, Bat feels he 
doesn*t have enough **merit** for 
better work, since an Army test 
set his l.Q, at only 93 . 

Not all are poor, however. 
DOCTOR BARNES enjoys a 
chance to practice after his forced 

I 



retirement. And DEAN ARMAN- 
RUDER is an art dilettante who 
acts as mayor and is rich enough 
to keep a secretary named NA- 
DINE PASKOW and two ser- 
vants, MANVEL CHAVEZ and 
his wife. 

They stop for the night outside 
Linares. Bat and FRED ZOG- 





BAUM, who is a writer, go into 
Linares, where they sense surpris- 
ing hostility. In a local bar they 
are forced into a fight. Bat 
escapes unhurt, but Fred develops 
a sudden severe headache. 

Then Bat is forced to fight 
again when JEFF SMITH, an 
unreconstructed type of old-time 



** southerner,'* challenges Fred be* 
cause the writer has been 
^^bothering" DIANA SWARD, a 
pretty and talented young artist. 
Jeffs biggest complaint is that 
Fred is a Negro and has no right 
to compete with him for Diana's 
favors. 

Bat reports to the town council.

stressing the rising hostility jrorn 
the local Mexicans. Then he takes 
ojf in his official car on a scouting 
trip to examine their route. On 
the way, he is stopped by an arm- 
ed young Mexican who gives his 
name as JOSE. Bat is disarmed 
and blindfolded. He is taken to 
a place where someone named 
DON CAESAR, who talks like 
a polished gentleman, threatens 
like a wild bandit. 

Don Caesar tells Bat that Mex- 
ico is being ruined by the 
relatively rich ^'Gringo'' tourists 
who come in their mobile towns 
and turn the Mexican people into 
nothing but mendicants. Don 
Caesar heads a group sworn to 
stop this. If New Woodstock does 
not turn back to the United 
States, the town will be ambushed 
and everyone in it will be killed. 

Bat is permitted to leave, but 
his gun and all-purpose phone are 
not returned to him. He goes back 
to report to the Town Council. 
Later, while they are discussing 
their best course, he finds his 
possessions returned to his car. 

The Town Council calls a 
general meeting to decide what 
to do. And Bat starts to tell his 
story. But Jeff Smith interrupts 
to question whether there is 
anything to worry them. He 
points to Bat and ridicules the 
story of the threats. 'It's all a 
damned lie," he claims. 

VI 

T here was another moment 
of shocked silence and then 
a muttering, then a jabbering. 

116 



Dean Armanruder rapped them 
to silence. 

He looked at Jeff Smith, still 
standing, a defiant smirk on his 
face. The senior executive com- 
mittee member said evenly, “Mr. 
Smith, you have either said too 
much or too little. Will you please 
elucidate?” 

Jeff Smith was eager to do so. 
“For the first part of the story 
we have only the word of Hardin 
and Zogbaum — from whom we 
haven’t as yet heard, though I 
assume he’ll back his fellow bar- 
room brawler. They say they went 
into town and that the Mexicans 
started a fight. That’s what they 
say. Evidently, the Linares chief 
of police sees it otherwise. The 
second part of the story has 
nothing to back it whatsoever. 
Mexico is a civilized country. 
Armed vigilantes don’t attack 
peaceful tourists. What Hardin’s 
purpose is, I wouldn’t know. For 
some reason he evidently doesn’t 
want to see New Woodstock con- 
tinue to our destination, South 
America. He wants to turn back. 
Possibly he’s afraid of the long 
trip ahead and would rather re- 
main in the States where life is 
admittedly easier, especially for 
the town’s peace officer.” 

The assembly buzzed again and 
Armanruder rapped for silence. 

He looked at Bat Hardin and 
said, “Do you have anything to 
say to this, Mr. Hardin?” 

“No,” Bat said. 

Armanruder looked back at Jeff 
Smith. “And what is your pro- 
posal, Mr. Smith?” 

“I propose, first, that we go 

IF 




on, as planned. And secondly that 
we depose this alarmist and elect 
a new police officer. I make it 
a motion.” 

There was silence for a mo- 
ment. 

Finally, Jim Blake said, “For 
the sake of bringing it to the vote, 
1 11 second that motion. And Fll 
also vote for Bat Hardin being 
retained.” 

Armanruder said, “Motion has 
been moved and seconded. Bat 
Hardin to be dismissed as police 
officer of New Woodstock. Miss 
Paskov, are you tied into the 
computer for voting?” 

“Yes, sir.” 



D ean Armanruder looked 
at the assembly. “To simpli- 
fy, if there is no objection, cast 
your vote for either Mr. Smith 
or Mr. Hardin.” 

There was little hesitation. 
Each member of the assembly put 
his pocket phone to his mouth 
and cast his vote. 

Nadine Paskov said dryly, 
“There were two votes for Mr. 
Smith.” 

A laugh tittered through the 
assembly. 

Jeff Smith flushed angrily and 
sat down. 

Bat Hardin, obviously, was 
gratified. He also wondered 
vaguely who had cast the second 
vote in favor of Smith, who had 
obviously voted for himself. 

Armanruder was saying, “We 
have all, except two, evidently ac- 
cepted the truthfulness of Mr. 
Hardin’s story, that he was kid-

napped and the town threatened. 
How large an element has threat- 
ened us, we cannot say, but a 
threat has been made. Further 
comments before we put to a vote 
whether or not we retreat?” 

Phil Terwilliger requested per- 
mission to speak. 

He said, “It is all very well 
to be gung ho, to wish to press 
on into adventure. However, when 
my wife — who is already quite 
ill — and I voted to take this trip 
with the rest of the town, we 
did not expect to be bitten by 
snakes in Nicaragua, or buried 
by a landslide in Costa Rica, 
or. .” His elderly voice went 
sarcastic. “. or even attacked 
by head-hunting Indians in Ecua- 
dor. We had been of the opin- 
ion that with the advent of the 
Pan American Highway it was 
quite possible these days to travel 
all the way to our destination in 
reasonable comfort and safety. 
However, if on our first day we 
are threatened by a body of armed 
men, then I think we have stuck 
our necks into something more 
than we had originally planned. 
I strongly urge that we turn back 
as a town. If you others vote to go 
on, then I, at least, will now 
disassociate myself from New 
Woodstock and return to the 
States to take up residence in 
some other mobile town or city.” 

There were others. They spoke 
in varying degrees of heat, in- 
dignation or fearfulness, some 
taking one side, some the other. 

When it was finally put to the 
vote, four-fifths of the assembly 
were for going on. The remainder 

117 




refused to accept the decision of 
the majority and decided to return 
in a body to Texas. The returnees 
numbered approximately one 
hundred of the mobile homes, 
largely those owned by the more 
elderly and by those not really 
involved in the arts themselves 
but more or less hangers-on of 
the art colony. 

T he question then became 
what to do with the com- 
munity property such as the aux- 
iliary vehicles and the town 
treasury, which was not overly 
large. The treasury was ac- 
cumulated by a slight tax on all 
citizens of the town, or a com- 
munity assessment if an emergen- 
cy of more than usual magnitude 
developed. 

Since the vote had gone so 
strongly for the element that 
wished to go on, it was decided 
that all auxiliaries remain with 
New Woodstock and that those 
who were returning be recom- 
pensed out of town funds for their 
share of what they left behind. 

And the question then became, 
where were these funds to come 
from, since the treasury held no 
such amount? 

This was solved by several of 
the more affluent town members 
such as Armanruder, Doctor 
Barnes and Jim Blake making a 
loan to the town which would 
be repaid as tax money came in. 
A small levy was also to be made, 
small enough not to be a strain 
even on citizens who existed solely 
on their Negative Income Tax, to 
help in the transaction. 

118 



Still another problem arose. 
Among those who were to return 
was the middle-aged Barbara Ste- 
vens, the competent nurse of Doc 
Barnes. He had two or three other 
practical nurses in the town, on 
whom he could call in emergency, 
but Miss Stevens was the only 
professional. 

In all, the meeting of the 
assembly took several hours and 
Bat Hardin could see that they 
wouldn’t be getting away that day. 
He didn’t like it. He didn’t like 
giving the vigilantes under Don 
Caesar the extra time to con- 
solidate their forces and to pre- 
pare for whatever trouble they had 
in mind for New Woodstock. 

‘However, there was nothing for 
it. Even aher the assembly had 
adjourned, there was considerable 
to be completed in the breakaway 
of the hundred mobile homes that 
had decided to return to the 
States. 

Bat headed in the direction of 
Sam Prager’s home and repair 
shop. 

He discovered Sam seated, 
sprawled rather, before his vehi- 
cles, in the same folding chair he 
had occupied at the assembly 
shortly before. He was scowling in 
thought. 

Bat said, “Having second 
thoughts about going on?” 

The other stirred. “No, not 
really. But I must say, I didn't 
expect to run into a hassle such 
as this so early in the game.” 

“Nor did I,” Bat admitted. “I 
didn’t know you were a Canadian, 
Sam — till you mentioned it.” 

“No particular reason to lean 

IF 




on the fact. There’s precious lit- 
tle difference between a Canadian 
such as myself and a Yankee such 
as you.” 

Bat had to laugh. “Calling me 
a Yankee is on the side of 
stretching a point I’m getting 
called just about everything today, 
starting with Gringo this morning. 
But I’m somewhat surprised 
you’re not with one of the Cana- 
dian mobile towns.” 

Sam shrugged. “Easier to get 
work in a Yank town. Not many 
of you have to work. You have 
Negative Income Tax. We haven’t 
come to that yet in Canada. 
Knock on wood.” 

Bat looked at him. “You don’t 
approve of NIT?” 

“Nope. Makes bums of people. 
Man was created to make his 
bread by the sweat of his brow.” 
Bat nodded. “I think you’re 
right. A man should work. Which 
brings us to the point. Did you 
finish repairing my phone?” 

S AM stood up and turned to- 
ward the door of his combined 
home and shop. “Yeah. I had 
to put in an entire new unit. Bat. 
You going to pay for it, or should 
I bill the town?” 

“Just to speed things up, I’ll 
pay you. I’ll take the bill to Ar- 
manruder later.” 

Bat Hardin followed the elec- 
tronic repairman into his shop. 
Sam Prager had a licensed credit 
exchanger attached to his TV 
phone screen by reason of his 
trade. Bat Hardin put his pocket 
phone cum credit card on the 
screen and his thumbprint on the 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



square at the screen’s side and 
looked at Sam. 

Sam said, “That’ll be twenty- 
three dollars and fifty cents.” 

Bat said into the screen, 
“Please credit to Sam Prager 
twenty-three dollars and fifty 
cents from my balance.” 

The screen said, “Transaction 
completed.” 

Bat took up his phone and 
returned it to his pocket. He said 
to Sam, “Do you have a gun?” 
Sam said, “Well, yes. A car- 
bine. I thought we’d possibly be 
running into deer country, wild 
pig and that sort of thing down 
in Central and South America.” 
“Does Edith drive?” 

“Sure.” 

“I suggest that when we take 
off, you let her drive and you 
sit next to her with the carbine.” 
Sam hissed a low whistle. “You 
really expect trouble, don’t you 
Bat?” 

Bat didn’t want to overly alarm 
the town. He said, “Not 
necessarily, but there’s no harm 
in being ready. If anybody does 
take a shot at us, I’d like to 
see an immediate response big 
enough to set them back on their 
heels.” 

Bat started in the direction of 
Dean Armanruder’s home, think- 
ing about it. The instructions he 
had just given Sam Prager had 
come to him on the spur of the 
moment but the more he con- 
sidered it, the more he liked the 
idea. 

A rmanruder was standing be- 
fore his mobile mansion talk- 

119 




iflg to Doc Barnes. Bat came for- 
ward and said to Armanruder and 
the other member of the executive 
committee, “I think it might be 
a good idea if you’d give me carte 
blanche on organizing the line of 
march tomorrow.” 

“How’s that, Hardin?” the for- 
mer magnate said. 

“Well, I’ve got a double motive. 
First, I think common sense dic- 
tates that we take off from 
Linares as ready for trouble as 
we can be, even though it may not 
materialize. We want no strag- 
glers, for one thing. I’m of the 
opinion that if a mobile home 
breaks down between here and 
the Pan American Highway, 
which should be safe, it should 
be abandoned and its inhabitants 
taken up to go on with us.” 

Doc Barnes said slowly, “I 
doubt if many of our people 
would simply leave their homes 
right next to the highway, Bat.” 
Bat looked at him. “Doc, I 
feel so strongly that nobody 
should be left behind that I sug- 
gest that if it becomes necessary 
to abandon one of our homes, 
or even more, that the owners 
be recompensed out of New 
Woodstock town funds.” 

Dean Armanruder puffed his 
cheeks. “That becomes quite a 
drain on the treasury, Hardin. 
And it’s already bare as a result 
of having to pay off the hundred 
homes that are turning back for 
their share of community proper- 
ty.’^ 

Bat said doggedly, “Under the 
circumstances, we can’t let 
anyone fall behind. Our best 

120 



chance is to push on as fast as 
possible. If we stopped, up there 
in the hills, we’d be sitting ducks 
for any snipers, or whatever.” 
“Ummm. And you said you had 
a double motive?” 

“Sir, usually when a mobile 
town moves, it proceeds more or 
less haphazardly. Sometimes, units 
lag behind for days. All right, 
I think that tomorrow New 
Woodstock should move in close 
order. Women driving, those 
men who possess guns sitting next 
to them, ready for action. I think, 
we should drive almost bumper 
to bumper, looking for any trou- 
ble and damn ready for it if it 
materializes.” 

Doc Barnes muttered, “Sounds 
like a confounded military con- 
voy.” 

Bat said softly, “It is.” 

Dean Armanruder was thinking 
about it. 

Bat said, “I'd like to put this 
on the community phone. You 
see, I suspect we have a leak. 
Ordinarily, our community phone 
wouldn’t be tapped by outsiders. 
But I suspect that anything that 
goes over it is forwarded to Don 
Caesar, or whoever. If so, then 
they’ll pick up this move of ours 
and perhaps our very readiness 
will dissuade them.” 

Armanruder was quite ob- 
viously taken aback. “A leak? 
What in the world do you mean 
by that?” 

“I mean that Don Caesar’s men 
were tipped off that I was coming 
up that road this morning. On 
top of that, my pocket phone was 
taken from me by the kidnappers 

IF 




but was sitting on my table when 
j returned. I doubt if a complete 
stranger to New Woodstock could 
have done it. He wouldn’t have 
known where my home was and 
he would have been spotted wan- 
dering through the town, even if 
he did know.” 

A rmanruder said, “All right, 
all right. You’re the police 
officer. So far as 1 am concerned, 
you can make any arrangement 
you wish pertaining to our so- 
called order of march tomorrow. 
Go into my office, if you wish, 
and use the desk phone there. 
You’ll be more comfortable,” 

Bat nodded, and said, “One 
other thing. I suggest we make 
all preliminary arrangements for 
leaving tonight and that we roll 
at the first flush of dawn. These 
people confronting us — if they’re 
confronting us — are not pro- 
fessional military. I doubt if they 
are very well organized. Civilians 
lack discipline. We might catch 
them unawares and be completely 
through the mountains while 
they’re still comfortably in bed.” 
“Well, that sounds reasonable,” 
Armanruder admitted. “Notify 
the town to that effect, Hardin.” 
Bat shook his head. “No. That 
wouldn’t do. We'll have to pass 
that on by word of mouth, not 
put It on the air. That might tip 
them off, if they have some way 
of tapping our communications,” 
“How about this leak of 
ydufs?” Doc Barnes demanded. 
“JF there is such a traitor among 
us, he’ll let them know.” 

Bat nodded again. “Of course. 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



And, if so, then we’ll know we’ve 
got a traitor and not just suspect 
it.” 

“You handle it, Hardin,” Ar- 
manruder said. 

Bat trudged to the major en- 
trance of the Armanruder home 
and found the door open. He en- 
tered and headed for the office. 

Nadine Paskov, in mini-shorts, 
but otherwise no advertisement 
for expansion of the textile indus- 
try, met him in the hall. 

Suddenly, she put a hand on 
his arm. “Bat, is there really 
danger?” 

He said carefully, “There prob- 
ably isn’t but the safe thing is 
to go ahead as though there is. 
The better prepared we are, the 
less danger there is.” 

“Do you think these people 
actucilly might shoot at us?” 

Bat said carefully, “They might 
but I’m not really expecting it. 
We just want to tread carefully, 
Miss Paskov.” 

“Look, Bat, do you think I 
should go back with the others 
to Texas?” 

He cocked his head slightly to 
one side. “Why didn’t you?” 

She took a breath. “It’s the 
best job I could ever get.” 

“You could always go on NIT, 
if you couldn’t get another.” 

“NIT, NIT! Poverty level, 
subsistence level income!” 

He said, “Well, it’s your 
decision, Miss Paskov. You can 
go back with the others, or on 
with us.” 

She said urgently, “B^t, you 
don’t understaild. He’s written me 
info his will. I can’t quit. But. 

121 




B at couldn’t think of anything 
to say to that. He sidestepped 
her and continued on to the office. 
He sat down at Armanruder’s 
desk and activated the TV phone 
and said into the screen, “New 
Woodstock, General Call.” 

And then: “Please hear this. 
This is Bat Hardin, your town 
police officer. With the concur- 
rence of Mr. Armanruder, I 
strongly make the following sug- 
gestions. That all of us who are 
armed, ride with our weapons at 
hand. Women should drive, when 
possible. If fired upon en route, 
return as heavy a barrage as 
possible. Even if you do not see 
an immediate target, fire in the 
direction from which the attack 
came. I want as large a display 
of fire power as we can muster. 
Even if you have a weapon of 
no larger caliber than a twenty- 
two, have it at hand. If you have 
only a shotgun, load it with as 
heavy a load as you have, either 
slugs or buckshot would be best. 
If you do not have a weapon, 
try to borrow one from those 
among us who have more than 
one. We shall proceed with several 
of our younger single men in the 
lead vehicles. If we run into a 
roadblock, it shall be their duty 
to clear it, even under fire. We’ll 
want volunteers for the lead vehi- 
cles. Please contact me. When we 
move, it will be bumper to bumper 
and no stragglers will be allowed. 
In case of breakdown, the mobile 
home involved. must be abandoned 
and its occupants taken up by 
its neighbors. We’ll try to send 
mechanics back for it from the 



next Mexican city which has 
suitable garages. If the house is 
destroyed, the owner will later be 
recompensed from the town 
treasury. If there are any ques- 
tions, please consult either me or 
Mr. Armanruder.” 

He sat there for a moment, 
thinking out further plans, then 
came to his feet and left. He 
didn’t see Nadine Paskov on his 
way out which was all right with 
him. He hated to have someone 
as nervous as she in the convoy. 
Fear is contagious. They needed 
to keep their cool, especially if 
they actually did run into grief. 

He walked over to Al Castro’s 
house and found his deputy talk- 
ing to Luke Robertson, standing 
in front of the mobile home. They 
cut short their conversation at his 
approach. He gave them a quick 
rundown on his plans and they 
nodded agreement. 

Bat said to Al Castro, “I'm 
going to let you take my usual 
place in the column. I’ll preceed 
the town by about two kilometers. 
We’ll be tuned into each other 
all the time. You do the same 
as everyone else, that is, let 
Pamela drive and you have your 
Gyro-jet pistol ready in your 
hand. Keep in continual touch 
with both me and Luke, here. 
Luke, you bring up the rear. Have 
young Tom Benton riding with 
you. My phone and Al’s will be 
continually open to you — we’ll be, 
on a three-way hookup.” 

They were both nodding. 

H e bit his heavy lower lip 
and hesitated before adding, 

IF

“Boys, once we're under way, 
ignore anything from Mr. Arman- 
ruder or anybody else of the 
executive committee, until we get 
to the Pan American Highway. 
Once on the move, wc are in 
command. There’s no democracy 
in combat. If anytlung happens 
to me, you take over, Al.” 

He told them to spread the 
word about the early departure 
time. 

Bat turned and headed for the 
nearby camper of Ferd Zogbaum. 
However, on the way he passed 
the mobile home of Diana Sward 
and found Ferd there idly talking 
with the feminine artist who was 
cleaning paint brushes. 

They gave him the standard 
friendly greeting and he explained 
the plans for the following morn- 
ing to them. 

He turned to Ferd and said, 
“Ferd, you’re cool when the bets 
are all down. I’d like you to take 
second place in the column behind 
Al Castro. If they hit us. 

Ferd said, “I don’t have a gun. 
Bat.” 

“Oh.” Bat Hardin rubbed the 
side of his face. “Well, there are 
a lot of homes in New Woodstock 
with more than one. Some of our 
people are hunting buffs. Seek one 
out and. .” 

Ferd Zogbaum’s lips were 
white. “I'm not allowed to carry 
a gun.” 

Bat looked at him. 

Ferd said, “I'm a felon. Bat.” 

VII 

44 a what.^“ Diana Sward 

Jy blurted. 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



He looked at her emptily. “I’m 
a paroled convict, Diana,” 

The three of them held a long 
silence. 

Ferd sucked in air and made 
a face. “You still don't unders- 
tand. 1 can't carry a gun. You 
see. I've got a bug planted in 
my skull.” 

That made no sense to either 
Di or Bat. 

Ferd said, “I mean an elec- 
tronic bug. Everything 1 say is 
monitored. If 1 have a gun, or 
if I get into violence, I get a split- 
ting headache and have to report 
immediately to my parole of- 
ficer — by TV phone, of course.” 

“Holy smokes,” Bat said in 
protest. 

“It’s better than being in a 
prison cell. Bat. There have been 
some changes of recent years in 
penology that a lot of people don’t 
know about. Today, most con- 
victed offenders are not kept in 
prison. Even lifers, such as 
myself.” 

“Life?” Di said. 

“Yes. I’m a three-time loser, 
Di. For the rest of my life Til 
carry this bug. If I have a gun 
in my possession, or if 1 par- 
ticipate in violence, my head 
aches unbearably until 1 report. 
They have a continual cross on 
me, always know exactly where 
I am. They don’t even care if 
I leave the country. If they 
wanted, they could drop me in 
my tracks, any place in the world. 
But at least 1 can carry on a 
reasonably normal life. It’s not- 
like the old days. Of course, 
if I wish to do certain things,

take a job, or get married, for 
instance, 1 have to report in. Then 
my parole officer decides if I can 
do it or not. A woman is warned 
that Tm a felon, a boss is also 
so informed." He added, wryly, 
‘‘Few women wish to marry a 
felon, and few bosses want one 
to work for him. However, weVe 
eligible for NIT." 

Bat said, uncomfortably, “What 
are you. .well, what were you 
sentenced for, Fcrd?" 

Ferd, his lips white again, said, 
“Are you asking me as a police 
officer?" 

“Don’t be an ass," Di said. 

Bat said, “Of course not. As a 
friend." 

“You have to ask me as a 
police officer, so I can explain 
later to my parole officer." 

“What in the hell are you talk- 
ing about?" 

Ferd sucked in air. This was 
hard for him. “Everything 1 say 
is monitored. If I use certain 
words the computers report it to 
my parole officer and I have to 
have an explanation." 

“All right," Bat said. “As town 
police officer, I ask, what were 
you given life for, Ferd?" 

“Conspiracy to commit sub- 
versive acts against the govern- 
ment." , 

They both stared at him. 

He shrugged. “You asked me. 
I told you. Shortly, I’ll get a 
headache and have to report to 
my parole officer. They caught 
me three times. 1 was easy to 
catch. Anybody's easy to catch 
these days when you can't exist 
without a credit card and when 



the computer data banks know 
everything about you that there 
is to know." 

He clasped his hands suddenly 
to his head. “Damn it! It’s start- 
ing," he muttered in agony. “I'll 
have to go." 

I N THE very first flush of dawn, 
Bat Hardin took off in his po- 
lice car. He wasn't pulling his 
mobile home. He had left it for 
Ferd Zogbaum to draw behind 
his camper. It would slow Ferd 
down but he’d be able to manage. 

Bat and his deputies had been 
lining the town up for the past 
two hours and it was as ready 
to roll as it would ever be. There 
had been a great buzz of excite- 
ment but for some reason 
everybody had tended to speak 
in whispers. 

He had both Al Castro and 
Luke Robertson on his car phone, 
the screen split so that both of 
their faces could be there at once. 

He passed Linares. The town 
was dead at this hour of the 
morning. When he was two 
kilometers along the road he 
looked at Al Castro and said, 
“Okay, Al, let her roll." 

They had agreed to attempt to 
keep at a one-hundred-kilometcrs- 
an-hour clip, if possible, and Bat 
Hardin remained at that speed. 
Light was coming on fast now 
and his head was continually in 
motion, peering to the right of 
the road, to the left, continually 
checking his rear-vision mirrors. 

He kept in continual com- 
munication with Al Castro and 
Luke Robertson, checking their

speeds. Everything was going fine. 
All during the night, the town's 
mechanics had worked on the 
engines of any electro-steamers 
that were suspect of possible 
breakdown. Thus far, all was 
tight, no stragglers. 

At almost the exact spot where 
he had been halted the morning 
before, he came to a sudden halt. 
Leaning nonchalantly against a 
lone mesquite tree by the side 
of the road was the one they 
had called Jose. He seemed to 
be alone, nor was there any cover 
in the immediate vicinity which 
might have held others. 

Bat said into the phone screen, 
“Al.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Slow down to about twenty- 
five. One of the jokers who picked 
me up yesterday is here.” 

“Okay.” 

His Gyro-jet carbine, which 
fired the very same 9mm rocket 
shell as the pistol which had been 
appropriated yesterday, was on the 
seat beside him but he left it there. 
The other had no weapon — in 
hand, at least. 

Bat got out of the car and 
approached. Jose stood erect and 
looked at him scornfully. 

“So, Gringo, you didn’t bother 
to listen to our warning.” 

Bat said, “Some did. About a 
hundred of our homes turned 
back.” 

“It isn’t enough. This is your 
last warning. Gringo. Turn back 
now and return to Texas or what 
will happen is your own fault.” 

Bat shook his head. “We have 
permission from the Mexican 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



authorities to enter and travel 
through Mexico.” He added, “As 
you know, there are women and 
children and elderly people in this 
town.” 

“We did not ask them to come 
to our country,” the other said 
flatly. “They too contribute to the 
corruption that you Gringos bring 
wherever you go.” 

B at Hardin, in a quick flow 
of motion, stepped closer and 
drove his left fist into the other’s 
stomach. Jose, his eyes popping 
in agony, folded forward and Bat 
slugged him brutally in the jaw. 
The Mexican collapsed to the 
ground. Bat reached down and 
frisked him. The other was out 
cold. 

Bat Hardin grunted satisfaction 
as he retrieved the Gyro-jet pistol 
which had been taken from him 
by the other the previous morning. 
He stuck it in his belt and return- 
ed to his car. 

He said into the car phone, 
“Okay, Al, back to full speed. 
Ignore the seeming corpse at the 
side of the road, if he’s still there 
when you go by. He’s just un- 
conscious.” 

They rolled on past the tiny 
town of Iturbide, also still asleep, 
only one or two sleepily shuffling 
locals on the streets. 

Bat was doubly alert now and 
unconsciously chewing away at his 
lip. He said to Al and Luke, 
“That fellow knew we were com- 
ing.” 

Luke said, “How could he 
have, Bat?” 

“Somebody told him.” 



125 




There was no answer to that. 

They were getting out of the 
mountains now, and Bat Hardin 
felt moderately happier. He hadn’t 
liked being caught in the canyons, 
mountain crags to both sides that 
could have sheltered snipers. For 
that matter, an enemy who was 
knowledgeable about dynamite 
could have, with a comparatively 
small charge, set off an avalanche 
that might have buried a score 
of homes. And he might have 
done it in such a manner that 
the police would have had their 
work cut out finding evidence that 
the landslide had not been an act 
of God. 

It was only forty-five kilometers 
to San Roberto and Bat realized 
that they were going to make it 
to the Pan American Highway 
without difficulty. If there was 
going to be an attack, it would 
already have taken place. The best 
spots for an ambush were all 
behind them. Don Caesar’s 
vigilantes simply had failed to 
materialize. 

It had been a bluff. A well 
acted out bluff, but a bluff. 
However, Bat didn’t like it. 
Somethiqg didn’t ring true. He had 
no doubt about the sincerity of 
Don Caesar, Jose and the others. 
They desperately wished to end 
the flood of mobile towns that 
were inundating their country. But 
what possibly could have been 
accomplished by the phony 
threat? Of course, a hundred 
homes had turned back but that 
wasn’t a drop in4he bucket. The 
vigilantes had achieved- virtually 
nothing to end. the flow of more 

126 



than . twenty towns and cities a 
day coming over the border. 

He put it from his mind. 

S HORTLY, they came to the end 
of Route E-60 and entered the 
wide Pan American Highway at 
the town of San Roberto. Without 
halting, Bat Hardin turned left 
and headed south. He had, thus 
far, continued to remain a full 
two kilometers before the convoy 
but now he dropped speed until 
Al Castro caught up with him. 

Bat said into the phone screen, 
“Okay, we can relax a bit now. 
However, still no stragglers. I 
want to put as much distance be- 
tween us and Linares as we can.” 
‘Righto,” Al yawned. “1 didn’t 
really expect anything to happen 
anyway. We have something like 
four hundred men with guns in 
this town. You’d need a small 
army to take us.” 

Bat said, “The precautions 
didn’t hurt us any.” He flicked 
Al and Luke off his phone screen 
and dialed a road map of this 
vicinity and checked if. The Pan 
American Highway at this point 
wasn’t automated so they’d have 
to remain on manual controls. 
That was all right with him. 

He flicked the map off and 
said, “New . Woodstock, Dean Ar^ 
raanruder.” 

Armanruder’s face faded m. He 
was evidently sitting next’ to Na- 
dine Paskov in his swank electro- 
steamer which drew one section 
of his mobile mansion. Bat knew 
that usually Manuel Chavez drove 
the other section and that his wife.

put as much space between us Woodstock is governed by an ex- 
and our anti-American friends as ecutive committee elected by the 
we can. It’s a fairly btg city and citizens.” 




Bat said, but gently, “Whose 
decisions have to be passed upon 
by the assembly of all town mem- 
bers.” 

“Of course. Very well, Hardin, 
ril put it to the vote, whether 
to press on all the way to San 
Luis Potosi and to skip stopping 
for lunch.” His face faded. 

Bat grunted. He sometimes 
wondered at his desire to hold 
down this job. What did he get 
out of it? Not even a bit of 
gratitude from such as Dean Ar- 
manruder, and the open dislike of 
such as Jeff Smith. 

Which brought Smith to mind 
again and again he wondered who 
had voted for that worthy to take 
over Bat’s office. But then he 
knew. Whoever the traitor was 
that had kept Don Caesar and 
his people informed on the move- 
ments of the town had also 
wanted Bat out and someone less 
competent in the crucial office of 
town police officer. That was an 
interesting thought. 

S AN Luis Potosi was the most 
modem and progressive Mex- 
ican city they had as yet seen. 
Situated, as it was, on the Pan 
American Highway and the prin- 
ciple route from the States to 
Mexico City, it was well equipped 
with sites for mobile towns. In 
fact, they spread out far over the 
countryside and in area were ac- 
tually larger than the city itself, 
though it would seem doubtful 
if all of the sites were ever com- 
pletely occupied at one time. 

There were three grades of 
sites, the smallest, ultra-luxurious 

128 



with a fine complement of stores, 
restaurants and even nightclubs 
and theatres. The least well 
equipped was by far the largest 
and intended for mobile towns 
and cities largely occupied by 
persons with no other income than 
their NIT. However, even the ac- 
commodations at this site must 
have seemed exotic to the average 
Mexican, if the complaints of Don 
Caesar and his men were to be 
taken literally. 

Dean Armanruder had called 
ahead for reservations and been 
accepted, in spite of the fact that 
two other towns were at present 
already parked in San Luis 
Potosi — evidently, like New 
Woodstock, on their way through 
to points further south. Their 
town, art colony that it was, sel- 
dom took on the expense of rent- 
ing space in sites of the more 
swank variety. Although some of 
New Woodstock’s citizens were 
rather wealthy, a considerably 
larger element were on NIT and 
had to watch expenditures. Here, 
in San Luis Potosi, they drove to 
the cheapest site available. 

Bat Hardin, as usual, parked 
near the administration building 
and before setting up his own 
home drifted about the town to 
check that all was well. Evidently 
it was. They’d had excellent luck 
all day with not a single break- 
down. The town had kept well 
together, much more so than 
usual. New Woodstock’s artists 
were apt to be a bit on the 
philosophical side and sometimes, 
on a long haul, the town might 
be stretched out several hundred 

IF 




kilometers. In fact, often single 
units or small groups would drop 
behind for days. It made life a 
misery for the town policeman 
who would have preferred more 
cohesion. 

Bat, sauntering along, passed 
Jeff Smith who was setting up 
his overly large home; overly large 
in view of its single occupant. 
Smith’s mobile home was not as 
big as those of Armanruder, Blake 
or even Sam Prager’s, although 
the Prager establishment included 
the workshop, of course. 

Jeff Smith looked up at him 
“Vigilantes,” he snorted. 

Bat ignored him and went on. 
He was afraid that the southerner 
wasn’t going to make out in New 
Woodstock. Actually, Bat was 
sorry. He couldn’t like the man 
but Smith was the only musical 
composer the art colony had and 
could have been expected to break 
down sooner or later and present 
some of his work at community 
affairs. 

All seemed i n order — with 
everyone so tired from the strain 
of the day and the long drive 
that it was a matter of a quick 
evening meal and then to bed. 
Bat returned to his own home, 
and w'ent through the motions of 
setting it up. 

H e went inside and dialed 
himself a tequila sour on the 
automatic bar. He could use the 
drink; he’d been through a lot 
and gotten precious little sleep the 
last couple of nights. 

Glass in hand, he slumped into 
the most comfortable chair and 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



automatically looked over at his 
small collection of books. But, 
the hell with it, he was too tired 
to read. 

On his phone screen, he dialed 
the local road map again and 
checked. Oueretaro was the next 
major city, two hundred and three 
kilometers to the south. That 
would probably be their next stop. 
It was far enough, in that they’d 
been pushing themselves for the 
past several days. They had made 
their decision to make the trek 
to South America while parked 
in the vicinity of New Orleans 
and had kept on the road since 
then. Some of the younger chil- 
dren, in particular, were getting 
tired. He supposed that they 
would take a several-day stop 
at Mexico City to rest up, make 
any repairs that had accumulated, 
shop for major items that might 
not be available in the smaller 
cities to the south, and allow time 
for those who had never seen the 
Mexican capital before to do some 
sightseeing. He checked. Oaxaca 
was a fairly good-sized town but 
otherwise the next major city to 
the south of Mexico City was 
Guatemala, in that country. 

There was a knock on his door 
and he said, “Come on in.” 

It was Diana Sward. 

She looked about the room and 
said, “Damn it, how is it that 
male bachelors are invariably 
neater than female ones? I’m 
ashamed of how my joint looks 
as compared to this.” 

Bat came to his feet. He said, 
“You’re an artist: paint, brushes, 
sketching paper, canvases, paint- 

129 




ings. It’s hard to expect that you 
could keep a mobile studio spot- 
less.” 

She sighed and sank down onto 
the couch, without invitation, 
stretching her long shapely legs 
out before her. 

He went over to the bar. 
“Drink?” 

“Do you have whiskey?” 

“No, you can’t have whiskey.” 
“Why not?” 

“Because you’re in Mexico. 
Drink the local product. In Mex- 
ico, drink tequila, mescal or 
Kahlua.” 

“You’re a hard man, Hardin. 

What’s Kahlua?” 

“A liqueur based on coffee and 
one of the best in the world.” 
“Sounds too sweet. What are 
you drinking?” 

“A tequila sour.” 

“You talked me into it.” 

He dialed another tequila sour 
and took it over to her and then 
returned to his own chair. 

They sipped for a moment in 
silence. Finally she said, “Re- 
member that conversation we had 
about I.Q.?” 

“Sure.” 

“I’ve been thinking about it. 
The question never occurred to 
me before — but is it desirable 
to breed for greater intelligence?” 

H e scowled at her. “How do 
you mean, Di?” 

“Well, take greater height. Why 
is being a six-footer or taller 
desirable? Why is the average 
height of the Japanese, slightly 
over five feet, not just as good, 
or better? Certainly, in the old 

130 



days when men slugged it out 
with swords, or when they worked 
with a shovel or plow, physical 
size was desirable — but why now? 
We don’t usually think of a man 
who weighs over two hundred as 
being in the best of shape, but 
we seem to have an absolute ma- 
nia to be over six feet and to 
have a genius level I.Q. Why? 
Has it ever been indicated, not 
to say proven, that the man with 
an I.Q. of 150 is happier than 
one with an I.Q. of 100? The 
genius, as well as the moron, is 
a misfit in society. Do we want 
to be smarter or happier? If it 
is the pursuit of happiness that 
is our primary interest, then 
perhaps we should not seek, as 
a race, a high intelligence quo- 
tient.” 

Bat thought about it, for some 
reason slightly irritated. The sub- 
ject was not a happy one with 
him. He said slowly, “Man is a 
thinking animal, Di. If it wasn’t 
for our superior intelligence we 
never would have gotten out of 
the caves.” 

“All right. But what I meant 
is man has largely licked the prob- 
lems he was confronted with in 
his infancy. We’ve defeated our 
animal enemies. We’ve conquered 
nature, at least to the extent where 
we can now satisfy all our needs 
in abundance. All right. Isn’t it 
time we took stock and decided 
where we want to go from here? 
We’ve achieved the necessities of 
life, now shouldn’t we resume the 
pursuit of real happiness?” 

“Whatever that is,” Bat said 
sourly. “Anyway, it’s a great idea 

IF 




that possibly the average person 
with an I.Q. of 100 is just as 
happy, or possibly happier, than 
one with 150. However, under 
the Meritocracy, I.Q. is what 
counts. And if you’re ambitious 
and want to get ahead in our 
society you’d best have one in 
the upper brackets.” 

She set her glass down and 
leaned forward slightly. “That’s 
what I mean. Maybe Ferd Zog- 
baum is correct. Maybe this 
Meritocracy of ours isn’t the end 
of the line so far as social evolu- 
tion is concerned, if there’s ever 
an end.” 

Bat said impatiently, “It’s true 
that in production today not all 
jobs require a high intelligence. 
There are various operations, the 
sensory-manipulative operations 
that are involved in handling a 
power shovel, for instance, which 
have no appreciable educational 
or intellectual requirements and 
which do not lend themselves to 
automatic processes. But the 
overwhelming majority of useful 
jobs today do require high I.Q. 
and there is simply little place 
for those who are not particularly 
bright, to put it bluntly.” 

“But there should be, that’s the 
point I’m trying to make.” 

B at made a gesture of impa- 
tience. “But the fact remains 
that there is no place for us in 
modern production. A fraction of 
the people can handle all of the 
jobs. Maybe it’s not good for the 
rest of us to sit around idle, but 
there’s no alternative.” 

She leaned forward still further, 

the towns must roll 



her elbows on her knees and her 
voice very earnest. 

“Then we’ve got to make some 
changes. Back before we licked 
the problems of production of 
abundance that was and had to 
be the main goal of the race. 
Food, clothing, shelter, medicine, 
education, recreation for all, in 
abundance. But now that we’ve 
gained the goals, let’s stop a 
minute and look around. How 
about the arts, how about the 
handicrafts? Ours has become a 
synthetic world, why not devote 
these surplus energies of ours, 
devote the leisure time that hangs 
so heavily, to cultivating the old 
virtues? My grandfather mentions 
that when he was a boy, prac- 
tically everybody played some 
musical instrument, there was a 
bandstand in every park and at 
least one band in every town, no 
matter how small. Women used 
to sew, knit, crochet, embroider, 
make quilts and so forth. Have 
you ever seen in a museum some 
of those homemade quilts and 
compared them with the mass 
produced things that we put on 
our beds today?” 

Bat was chewing away on his 
lip. He said, “Some people already 
go into the arts. Yourself, for- 
instance. But not everybody has 
talent. And most are too lazy, 
if they don’t have to, to bother 
with doing ceramics, weaving 
cloth, quilting or whatever.” 
“Perhaps they are now, but 
that’s our problem. We’ve got to 
educate our people to want to 
do them. Take cooking. Cooking 
has become automated — and it 

131 




lisstes like it. Why, the person 
who could afford decent food a 
hundred years ago wouldn't have 
dreamed of eating the tasteless 
stuff that we down these days. 
N^cver has food been more 
beautifully packaged, been so 
adulterated, and tasted so poorly. 
And music. For all practical pur- 
poses. it's all canned. Sometimes 
1 think that a few dozen musicians 
are turning out all the music for 
the country. How long has it been 
since you've seen a live musician? 
How long has it been since you've 
seen live theatre?” 

“It. doesn’t make sense in this 
day for there to be live theatres, 
employing tens of thousands of 
actors, when a cast of twenty can 
entertain fifty million persons at 
once over TV.” 

“Like hell it doesn't,” she said. 
“That’s exactly the point I was 
trying to make. I'm beginning to 
suspect that Ferd is right. Our 
present society needs a little sub- 
verting. What time is it?'’ She 
brought her pocket phone from 
l^cr jeans and dialed the time. 

“Good Lord,” she said. “Is it 
that late? I better be going. I 
assume w'e’re off to a fairly early 
start in the morning.” 

Bat shrugged. “Not necessarily. 
We'll probably only go about two 
hundred kilometers.” He stood to 
see her to the door. 

B at Hardin had been right. 

New Woodstock was slow to 
get underway the following mor- 
ing. It was almost eleven o'clock 
before they began to roll. 

Dean Armanruder was impa- 

132 



tient with 'Bat but yielded to his 
demand that the town remain in 
tight convoy again this day. 

Bat led the way down the Pan 
American Highway, about a 
kilometer in advance of the town 
proper. A1 Castro — driving today 
rather than his wife Pamela — was 
in Bat’s usual place immediately 
ahead of the column. Luke 
Robertson brouglit up the very 
rear. 

All went without incident for 
the first 120 kilometers, then 
before him Bat spotted an official- 
looking car, with two uniformed 
men next to it. There was a 
crossroad and a barrier blocked 
the highway they were proceeding 
along. The sign on the barrier 
read Dcsvicicion and an arrow 
pointed to the right. 

Bat pulled up and one of the 
uniformed Mexicans canle over 
and touched the peak of his cap 
in an informal salute. 

Bat said, “What’s up?” 

''Desviacion,'* the other told 
him, then in passable English, 
“What you call a detour, Senor. 
The road is being worked upon 
ahead.” He brought forth a road 
map from his hip pocket and 
traced on it with a finger. “It 
is not much difference in distance. 
You go over here toward Dolores 
Hidalgo and then turn south to 
San Miguel de Allende. Then you 
come out at Oucrctaro, here.” He 
shrugged. “Actually, it is a much 
more beautiful drive than this 
one.” 

Bat shrugged too. “Okay,” he 
said. The other turned and went 
back to the car. 



IF 




The town was beginning to 
catch up with him. He raised Al 
Castro in his phone and said, 
“Slight detour. We turn right.” 

“Okay as she goes,” Al yawn- 
ed. “Hotter’n hell today. 1 hate 
heat.” Al also hated cold, when 
it was cold and rain when it rain- 
ed, as Bat Hardin recalled. 

Bat flicked him off and pro- 
ceeded. 

He dialed the local road map 
and checked out the route of 
the detour. As the Mexican had 
said, it didn’t lengthen their trip 
by very much. The road, of 
course, wasn’t nearly as fine as 
the Pan American Highway, but 
it was adequate. There seemed 
to be no traffic whatsoever, which 
mildly surprised him. But then, 
of course, there weren’t nearly the 
number of vehicles in Mexico that 
there were in the States and this 
was a by-way. 

Before quite reaching the 
historic Dolores Hidalgo which. 
Bat vaguely recalled, was the town 
where the Mexican revolution 
against Spain had begun, the road 
turned south. Before him he could 
see mountains rising, but in this 
vicinity, although there were some 
hills and rises, the terrain was 
largely flat and covered with cac- 
tus and mesquite. Attractive 
enough, in sort of a wasteland 
way, but not exactly an area 
where one would build a home. 

Suddenly his screen flicked on 
and Luke Robertson’s face was 
there, his eyes wide. “Bat!” he 
yelped. “I’m under fire and. .” 

The screen blanked and Luke’s 
face was replaced with an abstract 

the towns must roll 



of meaningless flashing colors. 

A barrage of screaming bullets 
ricocheted off the armor of Bat 
Hardin’s converted police car. 
Across the fields, he could see 
large scurrying groups of men, 
running and firing, converging 
upon New Woodstock. 



VIII 

H e banged the activating 
switch of his car TV phone 
and snapped into the screen, 
“Mexican Highway Police. Em- 
ergency!” 

The screen still ran impossible 
color. 

He slewed the car to the left, 
presenting the far side to the fire 
from the attackers. He grabbed 
his portable phone from his 
pocket, aclivt^ted it and yelled, 
“Mexican Highway Police. 
Emergency! Emergency!” 

But that screen too was a 
meaningless menage of streaks of 
moving color. Bat banged out the 
side of his car and, crouching, 
darted back to Al Castro’s vehicle, 
now immediately behind him. Al 
was driving, Pamela seated next 
to him, her pudding face a lard 
gray and her eyes in shock. Al 
was firing over her through her 
window with his Gyro-jet pistol, 
his face wild with excitement. 

Bat shouted, “Al! Your car 
phone! Does it work?” 

The magazine of his deputy’s 
gun was evidently now empty. Al 
slammed the phone on. The color 
was there again. 

Bat groaned. “They’ve got 

133 




some kind of a scrambler on us. 
All Out over the fields! Lead them 
into a complete circle. Bumper 
to bumper! Take off!” 

He ripped back to his own car 
and fetched his carbine. 

Al Castro took out over the 
cactus-strewn field, bumping and 
bouncing, his mobile home 
careening every which way behind 
him. 

Jake Benton, his eyes wide, was 
immediately behind Al. Bat yelled 
to him from the shelter of the 
rear of his police car. 

“Follow Castro! Form a circle! 
Form a circle! Then get out and 
return the fire!” 

Benton’s mobile home, careen- 
ing as wildly as Al Castro’s before 
him, took out over the desolate 
field. 

Sam Prager’s vehicles were 
next. Bat yelled, “Auxiliaries to 
the middle! Form a second circle. 
Hospital and school in the cen- 
ter!” 

Sam nodded, gripped his wheel 
fiercely and v/as out after the 
others. 

Bat glared right and left. The 
attackers were largely in front 
on hills and knolls and too 
far off for really accurate fire, 
though they were closing in fast. 
However, occasionally slugs were 
still bouncing off the other side 
of his car. They seemed hitting 
from all directions and Luke’s 
warning before the phones had 
gone out meant they were in the 
rear of the convoy as well. 

He continued to yell orders 
as the homes went by. Out in 
the field, Al Castro, avoiding 



mesquite trees but plowing right 
over all except the largest cactus 
plants, was making his circle. 

Bat fished inside the car and 
located a fresh clip for his car- 
bine. He fired and fired again, 
bellowing directions to the ar- 
riving cars. 

When the hospital, one section 
of which was being driven by Doc 
Barnes himself, came up. Bat 
yelled, “The hospital and school 
to the very center. Women and 
kids into them! They’ve got the 
thickest walls, for soundproofing. 
Women and kids into school and 
hospital!” 

Doc Barnes nodded grimly and 
took off after the others, his sec- 
tion of the hospital bobbing 
desperately behind. 

A l Castro’s car and his 
drawn home were beginning 
to come up from the rear on the 
tail end of the last of the New 
Woodstock column. Even after 
the circle had been drawn, with 
Luke Robertson’s vehicles at the 
closure, Al continued to circle, 
slowing down, getting as near 
bumper to bumper as possible. 

Bat Hardin jumped back into 
his car and took after them. Luke 
Robertson slewed to one side to 
let him through. Bat drove to the 
center and popped out. All the 
auxiliaries had been drawn, as 
directed, in a smaller circle; within 
were hospital and school which 
a dozen men were setting up as 
rapidly as possible in the mount- 
ing confusion. 

Bat yelled at the top of his 

IF 



134 




voice, “All with guns take posi- 
tions behind your homes. All 
without, get shovels. Dig foxholes. 
All with more than one gun, turn 
them over to your neighbors. All 
women with children, into hospital 
or school. Lie down on the floors. 
All women under thirty-five 
without children, get guns or 
shovels. If you have no shovels, 
frying pans. Dig!” 

Children were screaming, wom- 
en calling and crying. Half of 
the town was running about in 
a hash of confusion. There were 
a dozen cases of hysteria. 

Jeff Smith came up, under his 
arm a wicked high-velocity game 
rifle with a telescopic sight. 

He looked around at the pre- 
parations Bat had ordered and 
which were now fully underway 
and said, “I understand you were 
in the Asian War. What was your 
rank?” 

Bat looked at him. “First Lieu- 
tenant, when it ended.” 

Jeff Smith cocked his head a 
little. “You don’t look the type 
that’s been through OTS.” 

Bat said, impatiently, “I was 
battle commissioned during the 
Mekong Delta debacle.” 

Smith nodded. “I was at the 
delta. 8th Airborne. Was a Staff 
Sergeant. What are your or- 
ders. .sir?” 

Bat took a breath. “Move 
around the circle, locate what 
other veterans we have. Spot them 
strategically. Be sure they all have 
the best weapons we have, even 
if you have to confiscate them 
from the others. .sergeant.” 
“Yes, sir.” Jeff Smith turned 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



and, crouching, hurried in the 
direction of the perimeter. 

Luke Robertson and Al Castro 
came in at a trot. 

“Wow!” Al shouted, over the 
blast of shotguns, the snip of 
twenty-twos and other small 
caliber gunfire, the snap of sport- 
ing and converted surplus military 
rifles. 

Bat rapped, “Al, get around 
the circle. Cut down on this fire. 
We’ll be out of ammo in half 
an hour. Cut the fire down to 
men with longer range rifles and 
our best shots. Cut those god- 
damned shotguns out. They can’t 
reach a fraction of the range those 
guys are at.” 

“Right, Bat.” Al scooted away. 

There was a whoosh of sound 
and beyond them a mesquite tree 
erupted in flame and explosion. 

Bat winced. “Holy smokes,” he 
protested. “A bazooka.” 

Luke said, pointing excitedly, 
“It came from over there on that 
knoll. Bat.” 

Bat Hardin was gnawing his 
lip in agitation. “That’s an old 
model, probably far back as the 
Second War. God only knows 
where they got it. But it’s out 
of range. Listen, Luke, go around 
and locate our best marksmen. 
They’ll know who they are. Get 
our best long-range rifles into 
their hands, those with telescopic 
sights. Pin that bazooka down. 
If they get it within range, we’re 
mincemeat.” 

Luke was off, crouching low 
as he left the semi-security of the 
inner circle of auxiliary vehicles. 

Bat snarled. So they had been 

135 




jumped in a bad spot. Now he 
realized that detour had been a 
plant. Don Caesar’s men had 
directed them out here. Now he 
realized why they hadn't been 
seeing other vehicles, cars and 
trucks along this lonely by-way. 
Somehow, the enemy had blocked 
off the road. Worse, in effect 
now, they were surrounded. Single 
men and small groups edging 
closer, darting in, scurrying 
around for cover. But the fire 
had fallen off. Evidently, the anti- 
American vigilantes hadn’t ex- 
pected this efficient a defense. 

Bat’s lips thinned back. “Come 
in and get us, you bastards,” he 
muttered. 

Two men went by with an im- 
provised stretcher. Doc Barnes 
came hurrying out of the hospital 
and bent over the victim. 

Bat called, “Is he bad?” 

Barnes looked up. ‘‘It’s 
Thompson. He’s dead.” 

Bat closed his eyes in pain. 
Fred Thompson had the biggest 
family in New Woodstock. Five 
children. 

Bat said to the two stretcher 
bearers, “Bury him immediately. 
We don’t want any of our dead 
lying around where they can be 
seen. Bad for morale,” 

Little Chuck Benton came up 
excitedly. “Mr. Hardin, what 
should I do?” 

Bat looked at him. The boy 
was eleven or twelve. He began 
to order him to the shelter of 
the school, then pulled up. He 
said, “Get a bucket of water and 
a dipper or cup, son. Go around 
to the men. Combat is dry work.” 

136 



“Yes sir.” 

Crouching low, as Smith, Cas- 
tro and Robertson before him. Bat 
left the shelter of the auxiliaries 
and scurried for the perimeter of 
mobile homes, his carbine in 
hand. He began touring, barking 
orders for more rapid digging of 
fox holes. 

Art Clarke came hurrying up 
to him, an enormous and glinting 
gun in hand. Bat Hardin 
recognized it. He snapped, “Isn’t 
that a Chinese Am-8? Where in 
the hell did you get it?” 

Even in this excitement, Clarke 
seemed slightly embarrassed. He 
said, “War souvenir.” 

“Fully automatic? How many 
clips do you have for it?” 

“Yeah. It’s the Canton model. 
Two clips.” 

“How much spare ammo?” 
“Possibly a hundred rounds.” 
Bat looked quickly around and 
yelled, “Milt Waterman! Over 
here.” 

The boy who usually drove the 
administration building when they 
were rolling came hustling up. 

Bat rapped, “You two, get into 
that hole over there. Set that au- 
tomatic rifle up. Milt, you keep 
the spare clip loaded. Art, you 
let loose a burst of fire from time 
to time. A longer burst than you’d 
expect from a gun that light. I 
want to make it look as though 
we’ve got a machine gun. Wait 
a minute. After you’ve let off a 
couple of bursts from this side, 
go to the direct opposite and do 
the same. Make it look as though 
we’ve got two machine guns. But 
go easy. Stretch out that ammo 

IF 




as much as you can, understand?” 
“Got it,” Art Clarke said ex- 
citedly. 

Bat walked on. 

D iana Sward was sitting on 
the ground at the rear of 
her mobile studio. She had a 
sporting rifle in her hands and 
her elbows were on her knees 
as she periodically and with great 
coolness squeezed off a shot. 

“Watch the ammunition,” Bat 
told her, beginning to go by. 

She grinned up at him, her eyes 
shining. “I think I nicked at least 
one. You know what this reminds 
me of? A wagon train, surround- 
ed by Sitting Bull’s braves.” 

“It is,” he said grimly and hur- 
ried on. He heard a bee buzz 
past his head. That had been a 
close one. 

He came to Dean Armanruder’s 
mobile mansion. Armanruder, his 
back tight against the side of one 
of the sections, his face pasty, 
screamed at him, 

“Do something!” 

Bat looked at him. “What? 
We’re doing all we can. They’ve 
got a scrambler around here, 
somewhere. We can’t call for 
help.” 

“Surrender! Tell them we’ll do 
anything! We've got money. 
Anything they want!” The older 
man was panting. “Tell them we’ll 
do anything they say.” 

Bat Hardin shook his head as 
though in an attempt to clear it. 
Two more of the men without 
guns went by, carrying one of 
the hospital’s stretchers, an inert 
form on it. 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



Jeff Smith was approaching 
from the direction opposite to the 
one in which Bat had been circling 
the perimeter. 

Bat said, “Sergeant, you and 
A1 Castro improvise a white flag. 

He added sardonically, “My 
compliments to Don Caesar and 
ask him for his terms.” 

“Yes, sir.” Crouching, Jeff 
Smith headed for the inner circle 
of auxiliaries. 

Bat went on. He passed Ferd 
Zogbaum, who coolly and effi- 
ciently was digging a small trench. 
He had an army surplus en- 
trenching tool. There were quite a 
few of the efficient compact tools 
in town, Bat knew. 

Bat said, “Ferd, there’s a 
scrambler on us. All electronic 
communication devices have been 
disrupted.” 

Ferd looked up, his face 
registering surprise. 

Bat said, before going on, “I 
doubt if that bug of yours is 
operative.” 

Jeff Smith and Al Castro came 
hurrying up. Smith had a white 
pillowcase tacked onto a broom 
handle with thumbtacks. 

The southerner said, “Any spe- 
cial instructions. Lieutenant?” 

Bat shook his head. “Play it 
by ear. Tell them we’ll go back. 
Tell them we pledge not to take 
any action against them, to the 
extent we can. Obviously, the 
Mexican authorities are going to 
get after them, but so far as we 
can, we’ll avoid prosecuting. Pro- 
mise anything. Armanruder of- 
fered money, but he’s hysterical.” 

“Yes, sir,” Jeff said. 



137 




T he two leaned their guns 
against a mobile home and 
stepped out into the open, the 
improvised white flag held high. 
For a moment, they stood 
there — obviously awaiting the im- 
pact of slugs before those out 
beyond could distinguish that they 
were seeking a conference. 

Bat Hardin, his hands cupped 
to his mouth was yelling, “Hold 
fire, hold fire, everybody!” 

The firing of the defenders .fell 
off. So did that of the attackers. 

Smith and Castro began to walk 
forward. Shortly, down from one 
of the nearer knolls came two 
others. Even at this distance, the 
hair of one showed gray. 

“Don Caesar,” Bat muttered. 
He 'turned and called to Ferd, 
“Make the rounds. Get Tom Ben- 
ton to go with you. Round up 
all the ammo we have and take 
it into the enclosure of the aux- 
iliaries and inventory it. Separate 
it into piles by caliber and gauge. 
Also inventory every gun we have, 
rifle, pistol, shotgun, by caliber 
and gauge. We’ve got to take rigid 
steps to conserve our munitions.” 
Dean Armanruder came up, 
still quaking, his eyes glaring. 
“What do you mean? What do 
you mean? We’re surrendering.” 
Bat said grimly, “We hope 
we’re surrendering but I doubt if 
we’re going to be allowed to.” 
He turned and called, “Keep dig- 
ging. When you get your fox holes 
finished, you with shovels go on 
into the inner circle and start a 
new trench. If worse comes to 
worst, we’ll make our last stand 
there.” 



Armanruder said shrilly, “Are 
you mad? We’re surrendering. 
We’ll do anything. I’ve got money! 
We can buy them off.” 

Bat said, “Mr. Armanruder, 
those men out there think they’re 
fighting for their country, their 
culture, for their socioeconomic 
system, their women and even 
their religion. It makes quite 
a motive for fighting. On top of 
that, it hasn’t been easy for them 
to organize this and put it over. 
They’re not going to have a sec- 
ond chance and they know it. 
The Mexican authorities are going 
to land on them like a ton of 
bricks. They’ll have to or Uncle 
Sam would take measures. So 
they’ve got to put this over this 
time. Their strategy is obvious. 
They’re going to make an example 
of us so frightful that no Ameri- 
can mobile homer would dream 
of coming to Mexico, and those 
already here are going to make 
a beeline for the border and never 
return.” 

“You’re insane!” 

“I hope so,” Bat growled. 

Several score of the men, guns 
in hand, had gathered around to 
watch after Smith and Castro, 
who had by now met the delega- 
tion from the other side. 

Bat spoke softly. “We’ve got 
one thing in our favor. They’ve 
got to finish us quickly. Somehow 
they’ve blocked the road both 
in front and behind but they can’t 
keep that up indefinitely. A police 
patrol or someone else will 
stumble on what’s happening. If 
we can stick it out until morning, 
we’ll have it made.” 



138 



IF 




Art Clarke said, “Great — but 
when night comes they’re going 
to bring that bazooka into range. 
Then we’ve had it.” 

Bat said, half angrily, “That’ll 
be all, Clarke. They probably only 
have a few rounds for it. The 
thing’s an antique. It’s unlikely 
they’ve got more than a few 
charges.” 

J EFF Smith and A1 Castro were 
on their way back. All stood 
in silence, waiting. 

The two reentered the perimeter 
of mobile homes. Both of their 
faces were strained. 

Bat said, “Well?” 

Jeff Smith looked him in the 
face. “They’ll grant no terms. 
Wouldn’t even allow the w o m - 
en and children to come out 
under a truce flag. The old one 
said it was less brutal in the long 
run to make this example so 
crushing a one that it would be 
done once and for all.” Smith 
snorted disgust. “He sent his 
apologies, but said there was no 
alternative.” 

“So,” Bat said. “A massacre.” 
He turned to the assembled men. 
“Return to your positions. So long 
as they’re at this distance, restrain 
your fire. Only veterans and 
our experienced marksmen with 
long-range rifles are to fire at 
all. Hold your small arms and 
shotguns up until they are at 
point blank range, which possibly 
won’t come until tonight.” 

Dean Armanruder shrilled, 
“No. No, don’t listen to him! 
Don’t shoot back at them! We’ll 
all surrender! We’ll go out with 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



our hands up, in a body. They’ll 
accept our surrender!” 

“Like hell they will,” Bat said. 
“Get back to your positions, 
men.” 

“Shut up, Hardin!” the former 
magnate yelled at him. “You’re 
removed from your position as 
town police officer. I’m in com- 
mand here!” He began going from 
group to group, yelling at the men, 
some of whom looked sheepish 
now. 

Somebody grumbled, “Maybe 
he’s right. If we all went out with 
our hands up. .” 

Jeff Smith looked at Bat. 

Bat said, “Sergeant, put him 
under arrest and take him into 
the inner circle. Post a guard over 
him, one of the older men we 
can spare from the firing line. 
If he attempts further to destroy 
morale, shoot him.” ' 

Smith said, “Yes, sir.” He 
turned and grabbed Armanruder 
by the arm and hustled him away, 
jerking at the restraint and pro- 
testing hysterically. 

The vigilantes were firing again, 
beginning to edge in. 

Bat began making the round 
once more, encouraging the 
marksmen, continually urging the 
conservation of all ammunition. 
“You’ll get your chance soon 
enough,” he snapped to those with 
short-range v/eapons. 

He came to Ferd Zogbaum, 
who was seated nonchalantly in 
a foxhole, looking out over the 
field. He held a double-barrel 
shotgun in his hands, but wasn’t 
firing it. 

Bat said, “See you’ve got 

139 




yourself a gun.” He began to go 
on. 

But Ferd looked at him 
strangely and said, “Bat. I've got 
a funny feeling.” 

Bat Hardin stopped and looked 
at him. 

Ferd looked out over the field 
again and said, “I've got a feeling 
that that scrambler, or whatever 
you called it, is awfully nearby. 
Well, say within a couple of hun- 
dred yards or so.” 

“How do you know?” 

“I don’t. 1 just have that 
feeling.” 

B at went on again, crouching, 
going from one foxhole to the 
next. 

He came to Sam Prager, who 
was crouched in a comfortably 
deep one-man entrenchment. Bat 
hunkered down on his heels and 
said, “Sam, tell me something 
about scramblers.” 

“Not much to tell,” Sam said. 
“You wouldn’t understand the 
workings unless you had some 
background in electronics.” 

“1 haven’t. How wide a range 
does one have?” 

Sam scowled. “According to 
what kind it is. The miiitary 
have some real doozies, blanket 
a wide, wide area.” 

“But would our pals out there 
be apt to have anything like that?” 
Sam looked up into the sky, 
scowling still. “Well, no, now that 
you mention it. And they don’t 
even have a helicopter.” 

“Why would they need one?” 
“It’d give them more range. As 
it is, they’ve probably got it 

140 



mounted on some high spot out 
there.” 

“Do I understand you right? 
It's got to be within sight of the 
area it’s blanking?” 

“Well, more or less. Part of 
it has to be. The antenna.” 

“So out there, somewhere 
within sight, is our scrambler?” 
“It’s got to be.” 

Bat took a deep breath. “Isn’t 
it portable? Can't they be moving 
it around?” 

“I wouldn’t think so. A 
scrambler’s a pretty delicate 
mechanism, Bat. They’d have to 
get it all set up. If they had to 
move it, it would be off for the 
time of moving and until they 
got it rigged up again.” 

Bat got up. The firing was 
growing slowly more intense from 
the other side, falling off on the 
part of the defenders who were 
becoming increasingly conscious 
of their depleted store of am- 
munition. New Woodstock had 
not been proceeding with any idea 
at all of a need for large stocks 
of cartridges and shells. Some 
weapons had only a score or so 
rounds available, which was the 
reason that Bat had pooled their 
supply. It was now being doled 
out grudgingly to the best shots. 

Bat Hardin again bent almost 
double as he scurried across the 
open space between the outer ring 
of vehicles and the inner. He 
sought out Jeff Smith, who was 
busy supervising the digging of 
the trench to mark their 
last stand, if it came to that. 

Bat said, “Sergeant.” 

The southerner came over and 

IF 




looked at him queslioningly. 

Bat pointed with his finger, 
swept it around the horizon. “Ac- 
cording to Sam Prager the 
scrambler is somewhere out there 
in an elevated position. Probably 
on one of those knolls. We could 
make a sortie and destroy it.” 

“Yeah,” the other one said 
disgustedly. “But which knoll?” 

Bat called over to Luke 
Robertson. “Luke, locate us a 
couple of pair of the strongest 
binoculars in town.” Then he 
turned back to Jeff Smith. 

“It seems that it takes a bit 
of time to set a scrambler up. 
Very delicate. And if you want 
to keep it in action, you can’t 
be moving it. It's got to sit there. 
Now our friend, Don Caesar, is 
no fool. He’s figured out this raid 
to the last detail. He knows that 
our only chance is to get to that 
scrambler and wreck it. He also 
knows that we have some four 
hundred armed and desperate men 
on hand for a sortie. So what 
does he do?” 



S mith’s forehead was wrinkled. 

“I’m not following you, Lieu- 
tenant.” 

“If one of those knolls out there 
was more strongly defended than 
any other, what would you 
suspect?” 

“That that’s where the 
scrambler was.” 

“And if one knoll had no men 
around it at all. 

Smith got it of a sudden. “You 
mean the old bastard is trying 
to fox us by having that damn 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



thing stuck up somewhere with 
nobody at all in the vicinity ?” 
“It's worth thinking about.” 
Luke came up with the glasses 
and handed them to Smith and 
Bat. They began to scan the vi- 
cinity slowly, carefully. 

Bat peered. “It would prob- 
ably be one of the higher knolls, 
and one not too very far away. 
They planned this down to the 
last detail. They maneuvered us 
out into this field, knew exactly 
where we’d have to go. And that 
scrambler was all set up and 
waiting for us when we arrived.” 
Jeff Smith said, “There it is. 
Lieutenant.” He pointed. “I can 
just barely make out an an- 
tenna, or whatever it is.” 

Bat Hardin direeted his glasses. 
“You're right. Okay, Sergeant. It's 
you and me.” 

Smith looked at him. “Just the 
two of us? Wouldn’t it make more 
sense if we took a hundred of 
the best men and headed for that 
knoll on the double?” 

Bat sh(X)k his head. “My con- 
verted police car is the only ar- 
mored vehicle in town and it’s a 
two-seater. We have, in short, the 
equivalent of a tank. Can you 
operate an AM-8?” 

“The Chinese automatic? Sure, 
why not?” 

“Get Art Clarke’s from him and 
both clips of ammo. I’ll meet you 
at my car.” 

Jeff Smith took off and Bat 
Hardin called to A1 Castro, “Al, 
let me have your gyro-jet pistol.” 
Al handed it over. Bat Hardin 
checked the magazine, jacked a 
9mm rocket cartridge into the 

141 




barrel. He stuck the gun in his 
belt, then brought forth his own 
identical weapon and checked and 
loaded it. Then he went over to 
his car, located spare 9mm rocket 
shells and dropped them into his 
side pocket. He took up his car- 
bine and filled the magazine to 
capacity. 

Bat said, “Al, get together our 
best half dozen marksmen. That 
knoll out there looks as though 
nobody at all is around. There’s 
nobody firing from the top or 
anything. However, I’ll bet my 
left arm that they’ve got a sizable 
defending force behind it, keeping 
hidden. Jeff and I are going to 
need all the covering fire we can 
get.” 

“Got you,” Al said, moving off. 



A DOZEN of the men who had 
been digging now stood 
around, pop-eyed, at what Bat 
was planning. 

Manuel Chavez, shovel in hand, 
said, “Mr. Hardin, for sure, you 
are not going out there into all 
that fire?” 

“Somebody's got to go, or we’ll 
unlikely see tomorrow,” Bat 
growled. “Come on. Sergeant. The 
delta was never like this.” 

“Thank the good Lord,” Jeff 
Smith muttered. “It was bad 
enough.” He had Art Clarke’s au- 
tomatic rifle under his arm and 
was stuffing the spare magazine 
into a side pocket. He climbed 
into the seat next to Bat’s driver 
position. 

Smith looked out over the ter- 
rain. “You think you can make 

14V 



it over that? You’d need at least 
a four wheel drive.” 

Bat grinned. “I’ve got secrets 
in this buggy.” He dropped the 
conversion lever, activated the air 
cushion and the vehicle rose a 
foot from the ground. He recessed 
the wheels and yelled out the 
window, “Luke, get that crate of 
yours out of the way.” 

“I'll be damned — a little old 
hover-car,” Smith said. 

Bat nodded while Luke hurried 
to get his electro-steamer and 
mobile home out of the way so 
that the two volunteers could 
leave the perimeter. 

Luke yelled, “Okay, Bat!” 

The police car, now air-cushion 
borne, flowed ahead. 

Immediately, slugs began to 
bounce off in screaming ricochet. 

“Holy smokes,” Bat bit out, 
“You’d think they were waiting 
for us. Keep your window up until 
we get on the scene. Bullet-proof 
glass. They’d have to have anti- 
tank shells to knock us off.” 

Smith said, “They don’t need 
anti-tank shells. They've got that 
bazooka.” 

“Ummm,” Bat said distasteful- 
ly, beginning to zig and zag in 
evasive action. “But I’ve got a 
sneaking suspicion that the boys 
operating it aren’t exactly crack 
shots. Who in the hell knows how 
to fire a bazooka accurately these 
days? It’s one thing sitting pat 
and directing it at something as 
big as New Woodstock. But a 
small target on the move?” 

“I hope you’re right. Lieu- 
tenant,” the other told him dryly. 
The knoll was perhaps three 

IF 




hundred yards away. AVs 
marksmen were going to have to 
be on their merit to do much 
in the way of covering. However, 
any fire at all was better than 
none, just so it didn’t hit Bat 
or Jeff Smith. 

Bat kept the car at as high 
a speed as was consistent with 
the terrain and their air cushions, 
but they were doing fifty 
kilometers an hour at best. Oc- 
casional bullets continued to rain 
off their armor but thus far there 
had been no stirring of opponents 
on the knoll which was their 
destination. Bat began to wonder 
if he had guessed wrong. But no, 
it was more than a guess, the 
closer they got the more obvious 
was the antenna, stretching its evil 
feelers up into the sky, robbing 
them of contact with the outside 
world and succor. 

A s THEY got nearer it became 
obvious that the car would 
never make it up to the summit. 

Bat groaned, “These things are 
impossible on non-horizonal sur- 
faces. They slip off in every 
direction except the one you want 
to go.” 

Jeff Smith bit out, “Get as far 
up as you can and then cover 
me. I’ll make a run for it.” 

“Why not me?” 

“Because you know how to 
drive this contraption and 1 
don’t.” 

“All right.” 

Just as they hit the bottom of 
the slope, a half dozen Mexicans 
materialized at the summit and 
began firing down at them. 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



Smith muttered, “Amateurs!” 
He activated the window, then 
steadied the Chinese automatic ri- 
fle on the sill and let loose a 
sweeping burst. Several went 
down, screaming pain; the others 
ducked for cover. 

Jeff Smith was out of the car, 
gun in hand and zig-zagging up 
to the crest. 

“Go it!” Bat yelled. He popped 
from the side of the car, both 
gyro-jet pistols in his hands. 

Jeff Smith scrambled, slid, fell, 
w^as on his feet again. Up he went. 

One of the Mexicans at the 
top got to his knees. He was 
holding some sort of automatic 
weapon with which Bat Hardin 
was unfamiliar. It stuttered and 
Jeff Smith fell off to the side. 

Bat fired twice and brought the 
gunner down. He started up the 
hill after his companion. From 
the perimeter of mobile homes 
came a hail of supporting fire, 
sweeping the top of the small 
mesa. 

Bat Hardin reached the other 
man. He jammed his pistols into 
his belt, swearing uncontrollably. 
“Bad?” he snapped, reaching 
down. 

Jeff Smith groaned, “Yeah. 
Nailed me at least twice. Belly.” 

Bat hiked the other up over 
his shoulder, reached down and 
swept up the automatic and 
started staggering and stumbling 
down the hill. 

A blow struck him in the right 
hip and he all but fell. 

He continued on, stumbling. He 
could feel the blood running down 
his leg.

They got to the car, on Smith’s 
side. Bat dumped him in and hur- 
ried around, limping and dragging 
his leg, to his own side. He lifted 
his right leg by grabbing hold of 
the cloth of his pants and swung 
it into the cab. He wedged himself 
in and pulled Smith to a position 
so that he could close the door 
on that side. He swerved the car 
and headed back. He would have 
liked to have made his own try 
for the crest but he doubted 
that his leg would allow him; and 
besides, Jeff Smith had to be got- 
ten back to Doc Barnes. 

Bullets were again caroming 
off the surface of the vehicle. 
They retraced their route. Twice, 
Bat Hardin recognized the whoosh 
and trail of bazooka rockets but 
he had been right; they were far 
off the mark. Whoever was on 
the old-time rocket launcher was 
no marksman. 

Luke Robertson’s vehicles were 
still drawn out of the way and 
Bat Hardin maneuvered through. 

He yelled out the window\ 
“Jeff’s been hit. Where's Doc 
Barnes?” 

Barnes came hurrying forw'ard. 

Jeff Smith, his face drained as 
death, looked over at Bat. 

“Hey, man.” 

“Yeah?” 

“Sorry about that. .that. .” 

Doc Barnes wrenched open the 
door of the car on Smith’s side 
and bent over him. 

He looked up at Bat. “He's 
dead.” 

B at Hard[N didn’t say any- 
thing for the moment. Two 

144 



men were hauling Jeff Smith from 
the car, ridiculously gently in view 
of the fact that pain would never 
come to the small southerner 
again. 

Bat said, “I've copped one too, 
Doc. See if you can patch me 
up a little.” 

“Get out of the car.” 

Bat shook his head. “Can’t. If 
I do. I'll never be able to get 
back in, and I’m the only one 
who can drive this thing.” He 
looked at Luke. “Somebody in 
here tipped them that we were 
coming in this vehicle. Find Na- 
dine Paskov. Find out who voted 
against me in that hassle I had 
with Jeff.” He added sourly, 
“She’s probably under some bed, 
somewhere. 1 suspect whoever 
cast that vote against me is our 
traitor. If she refuses to tell you, 
for whatever reason, slap her 
around a little.” 

“Got it,” Luke said. “What 
do I do if I find the traitor?” 

Bat looked at him. 

“Got it,” Luke said and was 
off. 

”Hold still, damn it,” Doc 
Barnes snapped. “Let me get this 
bandage on. You need plasma.” 
“Oh, great,” Bat said. “Have 
you got a pep pill instead?” He 
looked out over the crowd and 
called, ‘Terd, you’re next.” 

“Coming up,” Ferd Zogbaum 
sang out, pushing his way through 
the assembled men. He caught up 
the automatic rifle that had fallen 
to the ground when the men had 
taken Smith’s body out ^nd 
scrambled into the bloody seat 
next to Bat. 



IF 




Bat called, feeling himself 
already weaker, “There’s an extra 
clip of ammo in Jeff’s pocket.” 
Somebody brought it. 

Bat Hardin activated the lift 
lever again and they started for- 
ward. 

He explained as they went, “I 
can’t get the car to the crest. 
You’ll have to make it on foot. 
All hell is breaking loose there. 
Don Caesar is sending new men 
over as fast as they can make 
it to defend the point. They know 
damn well, now, that we know 
it’s there and they’ve got to defend 
it.” He felt his voice going weaker. 

Next to him, Ferd Zogbaum 
was checking the clip in the gun. 
Jeff Smith had nearly emptied it. 
Ferd threw it and rammed home 
the spare full clip. 

Bat said, weakly. “Where’d you 
get checked out on the Am-8?” 

“I was in the big one, too.” 
They were approaching the 
knoll. From behind, the full bar- 
rage of all that New Woodstock 
could mount in the way of long- 
range rifles was firing over them, 
attempting to pin down any of 
the enemy forces on hand. 

Bat ground to a halt. He pulled 
his two pistols out. 

“Okay, Ferd, it’s all yours.” 
Ferd was out of the car, au- 
tomatic in hands and scurrying 
up the hill. A continual fire kicked 
up the dust around his feet but 
he miraculously remained erect. 
Bat, his eyes fogging, leaned out 
the window of the car and blasted 
away at anything else that moved. 

The freelance writer achieved 
the top, fired in this direction and

that and finally immediately down 
as though toward his feet. He 
turned and began retracing his 
steps, running dangerously. He 
fell, rolled a score of feet, stag- 
gered back erect and came on 
again. 

Suddenly, Ferd Zogbaum stop- 
ped dead in his tracks. The au- 
tomatic rifle dropped from his 
hands. He grabbed his head 
desperately and began to waver. 

“The bug!” 

He staggered around, com- 
pletely out of control of himself, 
moaning agony. 

Bat, sagging weakly himself, 
flicked on his phone and stut- 
tered, “Emergency, emergency. 
Mexican Police. Road Dolores 
Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende. 
Emergency, emergency, emer. .” 
And then the fog rolled in. 



W HEN Bat Hardin came con- 
scious again, he was in the 
mobile dinic of Doc Barnes. He 
felt weak but his mind was alert. 
He looked about him. Ferd Zog- 
baum, unconscious, was in the 
next bed. It was a three-bed dor- 
mitory. The other bed was empty. 

Doc Barnes came in followed 
by Diana Sward who was wearing 
a white nurse's smock. She was 
obviously a volunteer. 

Barnes said, “You’re awake. 
Good.” He turned and looked 
down at Ferd Zogbaum. 

Bat said, “How’s Ferd?” 

“He’ll be all right. We’re taking 
him in for some minor surgery 
now.” 

Bat said, “Listen, has he been 

145 




unconscious all this time?” 

Doc Barnes looked at him im- 
patiently over his shoulder. “Why, 
yes.” 

Bat said, “Look Doc, when you 
were in private practice what was 
your specialty?” 

“Why, I was a surgeon.” 
“Brain surgeon?” 

“No. I have done some brain 
surgery but it was not my special- 
ty.” 

Bat took a deep breath. “Look, 
Doc. Ferd Zogbaum is going to 
die on your operating table.” 

Di Sward blurted, “Don’t be 
an ass.” 

He ignored her. “Doc, Ferd has 
an electronic device planted in his 
skull. Can you take it out?” 
Barnes stared at him. 

Bat pursued.. “He’s a paroled 
convict. Life sentence. He saved 
us all. Look Doc. We took a 
lot of casualties in this fracas. 
All is confusion. He can die on 
your operating table. You can 
sign — whatever it is you doctors 
sign when a guy cashes in.” 

“I’m an ethical. .” 

“And you and everybody in 
New Woodstock owe your life to 
Ferd Zogbaum.” 

Doctor Barnes held a long 
silence. Finally he said, “What 
was he sentenced to life for? I 
have heard of this electronic bug 
before but it is the first in my 
experience. Is he a murderer?” 

It was Di Sward who said 
heatedly, “He’s an idealist! He 
has political objections to the 
present socioeconomic system in 
the States.” 

Doc Barnes looked at her 



wryly. “You seem a bit partisan, 
Miss Sward. However, so am I. 
I don’t know exactly what they 
are, but I too have reservations 
about our present socioeconomic 
system. You are sure that Zog- 
baum’s, ah, crimes, are all of a 
political nature?” 

“Yes!” Diana said firmly. 

“Very well. Now the question 
becomes, if he, ah, dies on my 
operating table and I remove the 
electronic device from his skull, 
how does he continue to collect 
his NIT or otherwise support 
himself?” 

Bat and Diana looked at each 
other blankly. 

Diana Sward said finally, “I 
make a reasonable living with my 
painting. He can write under a 
pseudonym until he gets to the 
point where he is making better 
sales. We’ll never return to the 
States.” 

Doc Barnes thought about it, 
disgust on his face. “Damn it,” 
he said. “Why can’t a doctor just 
carve them up, or slip them the 
necessary shots or pills?” He 
looked at Di. “Miss Sward, let’s 
make the arrangements to get this 
operation rolling.” He turned and 
left the room. 

Diana Sward looked at Bat and 
said, “I think we’ve swung him. 
See you later. Bat.” 

“Yeah, see you later, Di,” he 
said, looking after the woman he 
loved as she left the room.

teously, “Your arrest was a 
technicality, of course. You are 
free to go at any time you wish, 
Senor Hardin. But after all, 
several of our citizens were killed, 
including Caesar Munoz and his 
son, Jose.” 

“And several of our own 
citizens,” Bat Hardin said softly. 

“Yes, including one that you 
killed yourselves, this Manuel 
Chavez.” 

“He was caught signaling Don 
Caesar’s men,” Bat said. “He 
tried to resist arrest and Mr. 
Robertson was forced to shoot 
him. Evidently, he had what 
amounted to a mania against his 
employer and against Americans 
in general.” 

The colonel gestured to the TV 
phone screen on his desk. “As 
I said, your arrest was a 
technicality; however, to double 
check on you, I secured your 
dossier from your National Data 
Banks. Your record, I am pleased 
to see, is impeccable.” 

Bat said, “I should congratulate 
you people on the speed with 
which you came to our assistance. 
I understand the heliocopters were 
there in less than half an hour.” 

The colonel nodded. “You see, 
we were aware of Caesar Munoz’s 
activities and his group was under 
observation. We knew they had 
desperate plans but weren’t ex- 
actly sure what they were. 
Nevertheless, we had a sizable 
force on continual alert. Frankly, 
we were astonished at the 
magnitude of his attempt. Thank 
God he has failed.” 

Bat looked at him. “Are you 

THE TOWNS MUST ROLL 



sure he has? What will happen 
when this affair hits the 
headlines?” 

“It will not hit the headlines, 
Senor Hardin. The Mexican and 
United States governments are 
cooperating to suppress the ac- 
count. We are aware of the prob- 
lems brought on by the mobile 
towns, but Don Caesar’s solution 
was not the correct one.” 

“What is the solution?” 

The colonel shrugged in a Latin 
gesture. “Perhaps I do not know. 
Perhaps it is more rapid progress 
for Mexico so that we, in turn, 
become an affluent society.” He 
laughed abruptly. “You would be 
surprised, Senor Hardin, how 
rapidly the spread of mobile 
homes is coming to our country. 
We already have several mobile 
resort towns, some of which cross 
periodically to the United States. 
And, to the south, Guatemala has 
recently complained of the large 
number of Mexican homes and 
trailers that are flooding that 
country.” 

Bat came to his feet. “I should 
be going. New Woodstock is 
scheduled to head south today. 
All repairs have been completed.” 

“Of course.” The colonel stood 
too and extended his hand for 
a shake. 

He said, “Would you mind 
answering one question, Senor 
Hardin?” 

Bat looked at him. 

The colonel said, “I went over 
the details of the whole unfor- 
tunate affair. I must say, I ad- 
mired your measures.” 

“Thanks,” Bat said. 



147 




“As a police officer myself, I 
find I am somewhat surprised that 
your talents are hidden away in 
such a small town as New 
Woodstock. Your war record is 
impressive.” He gestured at Bat’s 
dossier, still in the screen on his 
desk. “Have you never considered 
attending one of your American 
police schools and then securing 
a position in one of your larger 
cities?” 

Bat said evenly, “I’m not eligi- 
ble.” 

The colonel frowned puzzle- 
ment. “But why?” 

“My I.Q. is inadequate.” 
“inadequate! We do not use 
the same system here in Mexico 
but 1 was under the impression 
that an I.Q. of 132 was quite 
superior.” 

“My I.Q. is 93, Colonel.” 



Frowning still, the colonel 
looked down at the dossier. “It 
says here, 132. You seem to have 
made some mistake, Sehor Har- 
din. One test shows 93, but the 
average is corrected to 132.” 

Bat Hardin stood silently for 
a long moment. 

Finally, he said softly, “A1 
Castro can take over my job.” 

The colonel’s eyebrows went 
up. “You are not continuing with 
the rest of your town to the 
south?” 

“No. Tm returning to the States 
to find my level. Perhaps Ferd 
Zogbaum was correct and there 
are basic changes to be made in 
the Meritocracy, but, if so, they’ll 
be made from the inside, not from 
without.” 

“I wish you luck, Sehor Har- 
din,” the colonel said. •

READING ROOM 

(Continued from page 113) 

letter words and a few overt sex 
scenes, this is one of the least 
depraved books I can imagine. 

In fact, in many ways this 
might be considered a wholesome 
and old-fashioned novel, despite 
the surface trimmings. The leading 
character is neither a weak anti- 
hero nor a pervert of any kind. 
In his own way, he’s a strong 
man facing up to his problems 
as best he can and slowly solving 
his own ethical obligations in 
terms of his conscience. If the 
novel isn’t inspirational, it’s at 
least up-beat in the final analysis. 
Spinrad seems to accept the fact 
that evil is rather horrible and 
to come out in favor of decency. 

T he novel concerns a power 
struggle between two men, 
with other groups doing some 
fighting from the sidelines. Jack 
Baron is a former radical activist 
who helped found a third party 
known as the S.J.C. Then he got 
into television by accident and has 
achieved success as a master of 
a television interview show known 
as Bug Jack Barron. With a hun- 
dred million viewers each week, 
he is intoxicated by his power 
to make or break almost any 
person or cause. Power has him 
in its grip and the old crusading 
spirit seemsTibout to die in him. 

As a result of a routine inter- 
view, he finds himself pitted 

READING ROOM 



against the noted Benedict 
Howards. Howards has become 
the leader in operating freezers for 
the dead who hope to be revived 
later when medical science has 
learned a bit more. Each freezing 
requires a deposit of $50,000 and 
there are a million frozen bodies 
so far. This gives Howards control 
of fifty billion dollars. He can buy 
Senators and thus he dominates 
the Democratic Party. He is now 
fighting to put through a bill to 
make his concern a legal 
monopoly in the frozen death 
field. Voting on the bill is due 
shortly and Barron’s needling of 
him is dangerous to his success. 

This soon develops into an all- 
out fight for dominance between 
the two men. Howards manages 
to enlist the help of Sara, the 
estranged but still beloved wife 
of Barron. He sends her back to 
Barron to persuade him to lay off. 
But when she finds evidence of 
the old crusader in Barron still, 
she again falls under his spell. 

Meantime, the Republican Par- 
ty recognizes it has no chance 
in the next election and seeks a 
coalition with the leader of the 
radical S.J.C. Lukas Greene, who 
controls the radicals, is the black 
governor of Mississippi and an 
old friend of Barron. Then at his 
prompting, the coalition offers 
nomination for the Presidency to 
Barron, since he seems the only 
one capable of fighting Howards’ 
political control. 

149 




Howards counters with an offer 
of immortality. He has been using 
his funds to pay for research that 
will let him live forever, and suc- 
cess has just been achieved. He 
promises the treatment to Barron 
and Sara. Barron realizes there is 
a concealed price, though he has 
no idea of how horrible it is. 
He decides to force Howards’ 
hand in hopes of learning what 
is behind the offer. 

T his is an extremely strong 
situation around which to 
build drama. Throughout most of 
the book, Spinrad pulls it off, 
though he falters briefly in one 
episode. There Howards is con- 
fronted with an emotional ac- 
cusation from a woman whose 
dying father can’t afford freezing. 
Howards should have found some 
excuse for a noble gesture to win 
the viewer’s sympathy; his failure 
to do so makes him seem too 
much of a patsy. If he can’t han- 
dle this, how did he fight to the 
top in a tough world, anyhow? 

Nevertheless, the first three- 
quarters of the book continues 
to build. Genuine passion and 
tension are developed during the 
several interview programs where 
Barron and Howards battle just 
below the awareness of the public. 
The elements of the struggle are 
made believable and the complex- 
ity of Barron’s character is used 
with fine insight. 

Then the last part of the book 

150 



runs into too many encounters 
where one character acts like a 
patsy. Barron puts himself in 
Howards’ headquarters, doing so 
even though he knows Howard has 
something extremely unpleasant 
set up for him there. Sara’s last 
gesture comes during an acid trip, 
not from her natural response to 
the situation; and Barron’s decision 
is then made less from inner con- 
viction than because of her act. 
Howards proves a pushover for 
the right nudge. His paranoia was 
established before. But for a hard 
man to crack so easily to pressure 
lets down much of the high- 
tension realism of the earlier 
parts. 

There are a couple of minor 
but irritating flaws in the attitudes 
of the characters throughout, 
however. Spinrad’s women are 
much less convincing than his men 
but usually this doesn’t matter in 
this book. For example, it’s a bit 
hard to accept their all being 
thrown into an orgiastic frenzy 
at the idea of a man wielding 
power. First it is the secretary, 
perhaps — but hardly both she and 
Sara. It’s also surprising that 
nobody in the novel seems to have 
any doubt about immortality’s 
being ultimately desirable at any 
price. History is full of men who 
gave up what they believed to be 
the immortality of their soul in 
heaven for a few years of power. 
And men still commit suicide, re- 
jecting even their normal span. 



IF 




Still, if Spinrad had thought out 
his final situations and the last 
encounter as well as he did the 
earlier developments, this would 
have been a splendid book. As 
it is, it adds up to an interesting 
one — and perhaps even a good 
one — but no more. 

I T would never have been a 
great science-fiction novel, 
however. Despite the immortality 
trappings, this is simply no more 
science fiction than were some 
of Alan Drury’s books. This is a 
mainstream novel with a few 
science-f iction touches . 

The world of Jack Barron is 
basically the world of today. His 
studio scenes are true and con- 
vincing against my own experience 
with somewhat similar sit- 
uations — but they are true for 
today. On the other hand, his 
black state capitol is described 
in more detail — but it doesn’t feel 
lived in until it is filled in with 
scenes from today’s ghetto streets. 
His New York City Bleeker Street 
is the one I traveled last Friday. 

The technology is early space- 
age modern with only the fillip 
of discovering a new medical 
marvel. Pot and acid are legal, 
but with no social appreciable 
difference. The major political 
change is the radical third party 
centering around the blacks and 
the New Left — but we get only 
vague hints of other effects from 
racial and ideological upheavals. 

READING ROOM 



Even the slang has remained 
what’s happening in 1967, after 
twenty years, though nothing 
alters so fast as the current “in” 
jargon. Here we’re faced with an 
uptight cat trying to dig that it’s 
the nitty-gritty before he splits. 
It ain’t groovy, man! Even if 
Barron learned the slang in 
Berkeley, this is 1987; he can’t 
have avoided dropping old ex- 
pressions and adding new ones. 

It’s a mainstream trick when 
the facts of a novel can’t fit into 
the here-and-now to suppose the 
necessary extra elements and dif- 
ferences and lay things in a sort 
of timeless tomorrow. But in 
science fiction we like to have 
all this thought out in detail. It’s 
the way the changes fit together 
to form a new and interesting 
future milieu that fascinates us 
with the future. 

A s AN example, when Howards 
finds he’s immortal, he must 
also realize that this only applies 
if no accident kills him. With his 
fixation on enduring forever, a 
science-fiction story would make 
sure he avoided risks. Yet he 
seems unaware of this as hp flies 
to meet Barron. This is probably 
all right for mainstream readers 
who don’t do much thinking about 
immortality; but science-fiction 
readers have seen too many other 
stories where such details are 
considered to overlook the in- 
consistency here. 

151 




In an article, Spinrad discussed 
a “new” method of punctuation 
that enabled him to make the 
reader go fast or slow as the 
writer chose. This, of course, is 
what normal punctuation does 
when handled properly. But the 
“new” method seemed to consist 
mostly of omitting commas. If it 
had any effect, it was only to 
slow the reading of all passages. 

The style has also come up 
for considerable discussion. It is 
different from most science-fiction 
stories but it’s hardly a great in- 
novation. It often seems inade- 
quately controlled, but it’s within 
the normal variation of the inner- 
dialogue, stream-of-consciousness 
writing style for intensely subjec- 
tive novels. Hume and others of 
the Paris Review clique were us- 
ing it in a very similar way at 
least fifteen years ago. Again, 
while it may be odd in science 
fiction, it is well chosen for the 
mainstream. 

This book shows a remarkable 
growth of Spinrad as a writer. 
His earlier work gave little 
evidence of the sustained passion 
so strong in the first part of this 
novel. It’s a pity, therefore, that 
the manuscript didn’t fall into the 
hands of a sympathetic but critical 
editor who could overcome the 
false notion that a writer’s words 
are too precious to change. Ar- 
tistic integrity only begins with 
doing one’s best; it should go on 
to an eagerness to discover ways 

152 



of improving from anyone who 
can help and thus making sure 
that the result really is the best 
possible. 

In the hands of an understand- 
ing editor this could have become 
a major mainstream novel. It 
would be a natural for the movies 
then and it would be no less in- 
teresting to the science-fiction au- 
dience. 

T he history of The Left Hand 
of Darkness by Ursula K. 
LeGuin (Ace, 950) is different 
from that of Spinrad’s book. 
There was absolutely no advance 
publicity. Nobody discussed the 
book before its release and Mrs. 
LeGuin has partaken in no pro- 
vocative writing for the fan maga- 
zines. Apparently she simply 
wrote it and sent it in. Ace bought 
it and published it as one of the 
Science-Fiction Specials. Only the 
mouth-to-mouth advertising of 
contented readers began to bring 
it the attention it deserves. 

This is a quietly passionate 
story about sex and love. But. it 
is a different kind of “book about 
sex” from what the term implies. 
There isn’t an overt scene of sex 
in the whole book or a word 
that anyone could object to. The 
sex here involves a race of human 
beings on another world where 
each individual is both male and 
female. The interest is then both 
psychological and sociological; it 
is the effect of such a development 

IF 




that is studied, not the rutting 
and gratification of the individual’s 
sexuality. 

At a deeper level, is an exam- 
ination of love that is not related 
to sexuality or romance. This is 
a love between individuals that 
can disregard mal«ness or 
femaleness. But it is none of the 
bland “love thy neighbor” stuff 
usually preached; this is a hard, 
real and active relationship. 

Genly Ai is sent to Winter, 
a planet where the ice age is at 
its peak and where most of the 
land is covered by a great glacier. 
His job is to win the planet to 
acceptance of membership in a 
sort of interstellar union, for 
which he can offer no tangible 
rewards. He has only his wits and 
training to aid him. There is no 
invasion force behind him. If he 
dies or is killed another envoy 
will be sent later. 

He finds the world broken into 
different nations. Karhide is a 
kingdom of village chiefs; rather 
loose and highly individualistic. 
Orgoreyn is a syndic, with almost 
every action governed from a 
central Committee. In both, there 
is something called shifgrethor, a 
conduct related to “face” saving 
but varying slightly from each 
other. Ai finds it difficult to un- 
derstand, just as they have trouble 
understanding him. 

H IS cause is taken up by Es- 
traven, a noble of Karhide. 

READING ROOM 



As a result, Estraven is exiled to 
Orgoreyn. War is unknown on 
Winter, but the two countries are 
in the process of inventing it. 
Estraven hopes Ai’s “union” will 
help prevent this. When Ai is in- 
terned in an Orgoreyn labor camp, 
Estraven rescues him. 

They still cannot fully trust or 
understand each other but they 
must somehow reach Estraven’s 
native section of Karhide to send 
out a message that will bring 
evidence to convince the king to 
accept the union. After that, the 
war can perhaps be stopped. 

Their only escape from 
Orgoreyn lies across the great 
glacier in the middle of Winter. 
This means a trip of a thousand 
miles on foot, with only the sup- 
plies they can carry, through ter- 
ritory nearly as hostile as Earth’s 
Antarctica. To make such a 
desperate trek, they must rely 
completely on each other, even 
though neither can yet fully trust 
his companion. 

The story is centered around 
that trip and what happens to 
Estraven and Ai during it — two 
men completely unlike in 
birthworld, culture or even 
in their physical form. 

It makes for a good adventure 
story but the book is far more 
than that. Every element is work- 
ed out in fine detail and then 
dovetailed skillfully into every 
other element. The background of 
Winter is a strange mixture of 

153 




the familiar and the alien. (I’m 
told this resembles Islandia; I 
wouldn’t know nor care, since this 
is only one factor among many 
here.) Even the misty union of 
the stars in the distant background 
takes on importance and becomes 
a fascinating and novel concept. 

When I finished the book, I 
put it down with affection and 
respect. And the next morning at 



breakfast I picked it up to check 
one small detail at the beginning, 
only to read through the whole 
book again. It was even better 
the second time, too! 

It’s a difficult book to review. 
But unless a better one comes 
along this year — which I don’t 
expect — I’ll make my real review 
of it by nominating it next year 
for a Hugo. •

IF 







THE COSMIC PHILOSOPHY OF 
K. E. TSIOLKOVSKY 

by Alexis N, Tsvetilcov 



T he posthumous glory of 
Konstantin Eduardovich 
Tsiolkovsky (K.E.T.), the great 
Russian pioneer in rocketry, came 
to Western Europe and the U.S.A. 
only after the successful launching 
of the first Sputnik in a desert 
of the Middle Asia — that is, after 
October 4, 1957. The world now 
knows the astronautic works of 
K.E.T. He wrote and published 
in Kaluga, Russia. His projects 
and scientific articles concerned 
hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, 
works in cosmic biology (astro- 
biology, as he named it) and the 
theory of cosmic rockets. The 
most important and best known 
were his works in rocketry, which 
he began in 1878. His principal 
work. Exploration of Space by 
Means of Reactive Apparatus, 
was published for the first time 
in 1896. 

I knew K.E.T. personally for 
a few years and I had a cor- 
respondence with him up to the 
end of his life in 1935, at the 



age of 78. After the death of 
K.E.T., all his manuscripts were 
brought to Moscow and placed 
somewhere in the governmental 
archives. In the old K.E.T. house, 
Bol’shaya Korovinskaya, No. 3, 
Kaluga, a museum bearing his 
name was soon organized, filled 
with his personal things of lesser 
importance. 

In articles about K.E.T., 
authors usually mention only his 
scientific-technical works and his 
science-fiction novels. However, 
there exists also a series of his 
brochures buried, perhaps forever, 
in the official archives. Rare sam- 
ples of those works, 1 am sure, 
are still in possession of a few 
persons in Russia. Those are his 
philosophical works, regarded of- 
ficially as anti-materialistic and 
therefore non-permissible. In spite 
of this, they are sometimes listed 
in his bibliography without com- 
ment. To the same category 
belongs also his correspon- 
dence — the letters received by 



155 




K.E.T. were confiscated by the 
same governmental office in Mos- 
cow. 

K.E.T. started his philosophical 
writings in 1914. The first of this 
series was the booklet Nirvana, 
published in Kaluga. 

O F JUST WHAT kind was the 
philosophy of K.E.T., always 
officially suppressed? It was main- 
ly a kind of nature-philosophy di- 
rected toward the ontological and 
ethical problems. K.E.T. usually 
did not write about any religion, 
a subject considered outmoded 
and even dangerous officially. The 
ethics, evidently, he did not con- 
nect with any religious teaching. 

‘The ethical principles are the 
result of evolutionary processes 
only,’' he said. 

The traces of this idea can be 
seen in his The Scientific Ethics 
and in the Monism of the 
Universe, Ethics, he thought, 
inevitably develop during the pro- 
cess of evolution of earthly and 
non-earthly intelligent beings. We 
do not need to fear the visits 
of non-earthly intelligent huma- 
noids, who arc older in their 
evolution than we are on our 
Earth. They have not yet ap- 
peared on our planet only because 
we are not prepared to meet them 
as friends and as the wise people. 
Such an appearance of other “in- 
tellectofers” would create panic 
in our society. We have first to 
send them out friendly signals and 

156 



let them know a little more about 
us. In his brochures, especially 
in The Will of the Universe and 
the Unknown Intelligent Forces 
(1928), K.E.T. mentioned two 
of the “meditative and inspiring 
illusions” he saw. 

Generally, K.E.T. avoided any 
mystical speculations. However, 
he lived an inner life unknown 
to anyone else. 

K.E.T. dreamed since his poor 
childhood about stars, interstellar 
flights, and later, about his 
rockets. There was nothing more 
beautiful, exalting or more impor- 
tant for him. 

In his philosophy first came the 
cosmogonic and cosmonautic 
ideas. He did not think very much 
about such cardinal physico- 
nietaphysical categories as Space 
and Time. They were for him 
just simple Newtonian realities, 
the media for floating of Energy, 
and Matter in them. Being a good 
mathematician, he understood the 
ideas of Einstein. However, he 
felt intuitively something wrong 
in the Einsteinian idea of the 
limiting velocity of light; he de- 
nied also the Riemann-Einsteinian 
finiteness of the space curvature. 
He was inclined more to the 
Lobachevskian point of view: that 
space is curved; however, infinite. 
Even in the classicial physics he 
fought against the teaching about 
Entropy, or the Thermal Death, 
of the Universe. He believed in 
the reversible processes in Nature. 

IF 




“Science cannot avoid a strange 
path,” K.E.T. had often said, 
“and sometimes such a path is 
more fruitful than the direct one.” 

K .E.T. was sure that most of 
the stars, their planets and the 
inhabitants of those planets are 
already in a later stage than our 
Sun, Earth, and ourselves. He 
wrote that the interstellar flights 
and colonization of distant worlds 
are the most common events in 
the Universe; only a few civiliza- 
tions, such as ours, have not yet 
advanced to that stage. Because 
of colonization, many stellar 
systems, especially those around 
the center of our Galaxy, i.e., 
in the space beyond the constella- 
tion Scorpio, are possibly united 
already under one administration. 

K.E.T. thought that extremely 
different forms of life might exist 
on other worlds, including living 
hydrogen. On the highest levels 
of evolution, he said, there can 
be also some bodiless, immaterial 
forms of life: islands of a pure 
mind or consciousness living in 
empty space. The union, the sum 
total of the whole world con- 
sciousness in the Will and Cause 
of the Universe. Such was his own 
religion, masked strongly by the 
concepts of naturalism. 

Most of the dearest ideas of 
K.E.T. are described in his 
Monism of the Universe — a sup- 
pressed work which had gained, 
however, a great deal of un- 



derground popularity. This small 
book ends with eight theses, 
almost each one beginning with 
the words, '^Razve mozhmo som- 
ny e V a t* s y a , . " ' , meaning 
'*Can one doubt. .” These 
*"R.M.S.'' theses sum up the ideas 
of the booklet. I present here a 
translation of them: 

“1. R.M.S. that the in- 
numerable multitude of planets 
are illuminated by their suns? 

“2. R.M.S. that on (at least) 
one of those planets life reached 
such might and perfection that 
we humans cannot imagine it. 
That might permit them (i.e., 
unearthly humanoids) to over- 
come the force of gravity and 
to colonize the Universe? 

“3. As a result, there does exist 
the spreading of perfection and 
dominance of mind in the Cos- 
mos. 

“4. R.M.S. that this happened 
already infinitely long ago, and 
this is the normal and permanent 
state of the Universe? The spon- 
taneous natural generation and 
evolution, with all its sufferings, 
is a rare exception. 

“5. R.M.S. that the atoms take 
part in conscious life, when they 
reach the brain or its equivalent? 
They reflect the state of life, 
however, without any permanent 
impressions. 

“6. R.M.S. that the world of 
matter is mixing up and 
periodically changing its forms; 
and the atom, an infinite number 

157 



THE COSMIC PHILOSOPHY OF K. E. TSIOLKOVSKY 




of times after the immense in- 
tervals of time, takes part in the 
processes of life? 

“7. R.M.S that the period of 
the stay of the atom in inorganic 
matter passes as a deep swoon, 
and such time does not exist for 
the atom? 

“8. R.M.S. that all periods of 
life flow together into a single, 
permanent, conscious, beatific and 
infinite stream of life?” 



S uch were the “R.M.S.” theses 
by K.E. Tsiolkovsky. Later he 
wrote an additional article in the 
Monism of the Universe — the 
Migration of the Atom, which 
bore the following thesis: Beside 
the insensible sojourn of atoms 
in the inorganic world, they have 
their hosts in the form of plants, 
animals and men. The animals, 
whose life is imperfect, mean- 
ingless, miserable, full with pain 
and suffering, must and will com- 
pletely disappear in the future, 
and the atoms will wander only 
in the plants and humans. Life 
in the plant is almost equal to 



non-existence, since it is insensi- 
ble. The superior beings, and the 
humans in the future, like good 
gardeners, will weed out lower 
animal species, harmful bacteria 
and valueless plants, except for 
laboratory samples. 

“Individuals die,” K.E.T. said. 
“However, the total amount of 
living matter increases. We can 
imagine a spherical organism with 
the cycles of physiological pro- 
cesses closed completely i n 
themselves. Such an organism 
will be immortal and 
photosynthetic (with some kind 
of chloro- or quanto-phyll in it) 
and it can develop even a higher 
consciousness. .” 

Such was a “strong wine made 
by K.E. Tsiolkovsky in Kaluga,” 
as one of his correspondents said. 
K.E.T. planned to make some 
corrections in his Monism of the 
Universe, but did not find time 
to do so. The main problems of 
his life lay in astronautics, and 
his cosmic philosophy was an ad- 
ditional, however important, pro- 
duct of his broad and original 
mind. •

(Continued from page 2) 

Moon. Dr. Menzel was president 
of the parent body. Commission 
16 — The Moon and the Planets, 
when it was first formed in 1964. 

These four men will decide — or 
will have decided by the time you 
read this — by what names future 
generations shall know the craters 
on the far side of the moon. 
Craters seen only — out of all 
Earth’s billions — by the three as- 
tronauts of Apollo 10: Air Force 
Col. Thomas P. Stafford, Comdrs. 
Eugene A. Cernan and John W. 
Young of the Navy. The I.A.U. 
Working Group's choices will be- 
come official when approved by 
the entire body of the 
I.A.U. — 2000 top astronomers 
representing every nation on Earth 
and supported by every 
government — when it meets in 
Brighton, England, in 1970. 

By tradition most of the far- 
side craters will be named after 
deceased scientists. The Russians 
may have established another 
precedent, that of naming some 
moonmarks for memorable 
science-fiction writers, by calling 
one of “their” craters Jules Verne. 

Dr. Menzel — besides being 
among Earth’s leading astron- 
omers — is an accomplished and 
recognized artist. His brilliantly 
executed Martians will appear in 
full and vibrant color on the 
cover of September Galaxy — IF\s 
companion magazine. Others will 
be exhibited in early July — by re- 



quest — at the International Scien- 
tific Conference in Liege, 
Belgium. Still others have long 
and quietly been collectors’ items 
among top space scientists. 

We plan to make enlarged color 
reproductions of GALAXY'S 
September ' cover Martians 
available to readers of IF and 
GALAXY. Those who wish to ac- 
quire original Martians may write 
to Dr. Menzel in care of either 
magazine. We are also hoping 
soon to arrange an exhibit of 
Menzel’s Martians in New York 
City. 

For whoever may question the 
role of science fiction in the 
molding of men and scien- 
tists — Dr. Menzel is a starswinger 
from far back. He put himself 
through graduate school a t 
Princeton by writing science fic- 
tion stories and popular science 
articles for Hugo Gernsback. 

IF's readers, and its editor, will 
undoubtably be subjected to a 
good deal of moonwash regarding 
the nonexistence of Moonworms 
once our astronauts stand on 
Earth's sole satellite. 

We, too, may give lip service to 
popular skepticism. But Dr. Men- 
zel’s blue eyes were incredibly 
clear and enormously candid as he 
told us about Moonworms — and 
he towers white-maned to the 
stars. 

And IF is the magazine of in- 
finite Alternatives.

—EDITOR 




HUE and CRY 

Readers write — and wrong! 



Dear Editor: 

You wouldn't believe the rumors 
rife with stress, plight and frantic 
speculation since the announcement 
that Someone had purchased Galaxy 
and If, and that our noble Pohl, 
around whom many s-f stars have 
gladly turned, was leaving. As con- 
tributor, reader and an officer of 
Science Fiction Writers of America, 
my apprehensions rise to the third 
power. 

1. Will Galaxy and If continue 
to publish the broad spectrum of 
science fiction? Both tales of wonder 
and tales to ponder have coexisted 
until now. To my mind there should 
be no cut-and-dried definition of 
what must be science fiction, this 
form and no other! A good story, 
well written, is a good story! 2. Will 
Galaxy and If continue to introduce 
new authors — for competition is as 
important to the writer as it is 
stimulating for the reader — and 
furthermore swells the ranks of 
SFWA which encourages good writ- 
ing in the field. 

3. Can anything be done through 
the new owner about the sorry state 
of distribution? When our friends, 
relatives and fans try to buy copies 
on the newsstand and can’t, it irketh 
and looseth prospective customers? 

4. Will something be done about 
the typesetters who either do not 
read English or what they are setting 
and bolix up things until the 
astonished author squirms rapidly 
into the nearest “o” and pulls the 
circle out. 

160 



5. Most important of all, what 
kind of a guy is this new editor 
Ejler Jakobsson? He edited Super 
Science back when, but — despite my 
advanced years and silver hair — it 
was before my time. 6. How open 
to author-editor discussion is he? 
Must I follow his “line”? Is he apt 
to pull whole sections of my pa- 
tiently-constructed and word-weighed 
stories without asking my per- 
mission? I am really a most tractable 
author and quite amenable to 
discussion, responding amiably to 
editorial suggestion, but preferring 
to be consulted! 

7. Is there any truth to the horri- 
ble rumors that story payments will 
be reduced — which will definitely 
reduce the number of writers able 
to continue producing in the field? 

8. Are other titles in the Galaxy -If 
combine to be resurrected? I hope 
this one is true because it will make 
everyone much happeir with more 
good stories to write and read. 

9. Will there still be provocative 
covers for which writers will produce 
new stories? 10. Will the features 
that enliven the magazines continue? 
11. What is the editorial climate on 
“taboos”? 12. and . whal will be 
so rare as a Galaxy in June? — Anne 
McCaffrey, Secretary, SFWA. 



Hi, Anne. By now we*ve met and 
share new secrets. To dear up the 
old, a resounding YES to your third 
power apprehensions 1 — 4 and 
8 — 10. As to number 5 — 'twas not 
ere your time. Just something you 
missed. We all have these regrets. 
6 — your words shall be mine at usual 
or better rates. Please? 7 — horrible 
rumors are untrue but have you 
taken a good look at reality lately? 
II — what*s taboo? 12 — an IF this 
June.
