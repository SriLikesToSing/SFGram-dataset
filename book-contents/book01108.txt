Old Home Month 



A few weeks ago (as this is 
written; but by the time you 
see it it’s going to be more like a 
few months), the Eastern Science 
Fiction Association devoted its 
annual meeting to honoring 
Galaxy. There were speeches by 
the likes of Harry Harrison, Les- 
ter del Rey, H. L. Gold, Jack 
Gaughan and any number of 
others ; there was a handsome 
little placque commemorating the 
event, which we now have on 
the wall of our reception room; 
and we thank them. 

And now, if we can say this 
without sounding too vain, it’s 
our turn. As you will know if 
you’ve looked at the forecast for 
the next issue, we propose to put 
out a special number for the next 
issue of Galaxy to commemorate 
its fifteenth anniversary; and this 
seems as good a time as any to 
put on record a few things we’ve 



held back from saying for a while. 
(This time the “we” is the edi- 
torial plural, by which is meant 
the present incumbent of the edi- 
torial hot-seat, namely Frederik 
Pohl.) 

TTorace Gold was the first and 
* longest-lasting editor of 
Galaxy, and he gave it a shape 
and policy which made a startling 
impact on the world of science 
fiction fifteen years ago. It is dif- 
ficult to exaggerate that impact. 
One measure of it is that for most 
of a decade the majority of the 
other science-fiction magazines 
imitated Gold’s magazine as 
closely as they could in one way 
or another. Another is that of the 
writers who have begun their ma- 
jor careers in science fiction since 
1950, nearly every one of them 
was primarily a Galaxy writer. 
Horace Gold’s notion of a proper 



lars, of course. Algis Budrys’s 
book review section will be taken 
up by an extremely enjoyable 
essay (we’ve just finished read- 
ing it) about science fiction in 
1950 and where it has led us all; 
Willy Ley too sets out to re- 
minisce, and does so in pleasant 
and informative style. But then 
you know that; his column al- 
ways is. 

Incidentally, we’ve just receiv- 
ed a copy of a new book by Willy 
which we think you’ll like. It’s 
called Ranger to the Moon 
(Signet), and what it’s about is 
clear from the title. Discursive 
and fact-packed, Willy Ley al- 
ways adds more to a subject 
than the bare bones would allow 
you to expect, however, and in 
Ranger to the Moon he tells 
about not only the photograph- 
taking shot that succeeded, but 
about the predecessors that fail- 
ed — and why; about die Moon 
itself, about its explorers that are 
yet to come, and its explorers of 
another kind who made their dis- 
coveries through the eye of a 
telescope, at a reach of a quarter 
of a million miles. 

Budrys has been busy, too. For 
the past three years the man has 
taken himself out of circulation 
in order to be an editor, most 
recently on the Playboy staff; 



but he has put all that behind 
him and returned to free-lancing. 
He has three new novels in the 
works, and we expect we’ll be 
bringing the one of them with 
which is science fiction to you 
pretty soon; meanwhile some of 
the finest of his earlier books are 
coming out in new editions — ■ 
Rogue Moon and Who?, for two 
— and if you haven’t read them, 
we suggest you do. 

We take it, by the way, that 
you enjoy his book review 
column as much as we do. The 
letters we get are what make us 
think so, of course. But this is 
a good time, perhaps, to say 
again what we have said before: 
Galaxy doesn’t have a letter 
column, but all the same we wel- 
come your letters. Omniscient we 
are not. 

We think that we’re doing 
what you want us to with the 
magazine, but we’re always grate- 
ful to be told what you think. 
So if the impulse comes to you 
to drop us a line of comment, 
don’t put it behind you because 
you think we aren’t interested. 
We are! Vitally! And the only 
check we have on how well we're 
succeeding, part from the conclu- 
sive but unanalytical reports of 
sales, is your letters . 

— FREDERIK POHL

science-fiction story was, and is, 
a story which is witty, bright and 
razor-edged. In order to get what 
he wanted, Horace Gold spared 
neither the writers nor himself. 
He had a reputation among some 
writers as a sort of slave-driver; 
but as one of the most frequently 
flogged of the slaves, the present 
editor can testify that, more oft- 
en than not, the results were 
worth it. All that was gold, Gold 
saw glittering; and painfully and 
persistently he set about com- 
pelling writers to pan away the 
dross. 

That was the Galaxy that was; 
now let’s talk about the present 
publication of the same name. 
When we (the undersigned, that 
is) took over from Gold nearly 
five years ago it was with the 
understanding that we were nei- 
ther able to continue the precise 
editorial mix that Gold had pio- 
neered — nobody else could do 
that — nor, as a matter of fact, 
did we want to. Times change. 
What is good in 1950 may not be 
quite right for 1965. We have 
never stated in the magazine just 
what it was that we proposed 
to do differently, but perhaps by 
now the record speaks for itself 
and we need only sum it up: 

The Galaxy of the ’50’s was a 
specialist magazine. What it did 
it did brilliantly, but it did not 
cover the full spectrum of sci- 
ence fiction. We have tried as 



best we could to retain some of 
the best of the 1950-odd Galaxy 
— a story like Robert Sheckley’s 
Mindswap, which we published 
last month, would have been 
right at home in any of those 
issues — but also to add some of 
the other kinds of science fiction 
that have their own special mer- 
its to offer: like the current is- 
sue’s Do I Wake or Dream? by 
Frank Herbert, which wouldn’t 
have been at home at all. To 
make this sort of transition is not 
an easy task (frankly, we were 
surprised to find how difficult, 
chancy and slow it was). But we 
think we’ve just about man- 
aged it; and we are gratified 
by the letters which have come 
to show that a good many read- 
ers are beginning to think so too. 

Next issue, however, is the 
closest we can come to reproduc- 
ing in 1965 the kinds of science 
fiction that characterized Galaxy 
in the 1950’s; we’ve induced a 
majority of the top Galaxy 
writers of all time to contribute, 
as many as we can fit into a 
single issue (you’ll find some of 
the names in the forecast). We 
mean it to express our own way 
of honoring H.L. Gold. 

And we think you’ll like it. 

B esides the writers listed in the 
forecast (and a couple of 
others not named, if we can fit 
them in), we will have our regu-

DREAM ?

I 

UTTe’s dead,” Bickel said. 

-M-Ie held up the severed end 
of a feeder tube, stared at the 
panel from which he had cut it. 
His heart was beating too fast 
and he could feel his hands 
trembling. 

Fluorescent red letters eight 



centimeters high spelled out a 
warning on the panel in front of 
him. The warning seemed a 
mockery after what he had just 
done. 

ORGANIC MENTAL CORE 
— TO BE REMOVED ONLY 
BY LIFE SYSTEMS ENGI- 
NEER. 

Bickel felt an extra sense of 



9 



quiet in the ship now. Something 
(not someone, he thought) was 
gone. It was as though the mo- 
lecular stillness of outer space had 
invaded the Earthling’s concen- 
tric hulls and spread through to 
the heart of this egg-shaped 
chunk of metal hurtling toward 
Tau Ceti. 

His two companions were 
wrapped in this silence, Bickel 
saw. They were afraid to break 
the quiet moment of shame and 
anger . and relief. 

“What else could he do?” Bic- 
kel demanded. He held up the 
severed tube, glared at it. 

Raja Flattery, their psychia- 
trist-chaplain, cleared his throat, 
said: “Easy, John. We share the 
blame equally.” 

Bickel turned his glare on 
Flattery, noted the man’s quiz- 
zical expression, calculated and 
penetrating, the narrow, haugh- 
ty face that somehow focused a 
sense of terrible superiority with- 
in remote brown eyes and up- 
raked black eyebrows. 

“You know what you can do 
with your blame!” Bickel growl- 
ed, but Flattery’s words destroy- 
ed his anger, made him feel de- 
feated. 

Bickel swung his attention to 
Timberlake — Gerrill Timber ■ 
lake, life systems engineer, the 
man who should’ve taken re- 
sponsibility for this dirty busi- 
ness. 



Timberlake, a quick and ner- 
vous scarecrow of a man with 
skin almost the color of his 
brown hair, stared at the metal 
deck near his feet, avoiding Bic- 
kers eyes. 

Timberlake’s weakness — his 
inability to kill the OMC 
even when that meant saving the 
ship with its thousands of help- 
less lives — had almost killed 
them all. And all the man could 
feel now was shame . and 
fear. 

There’d been no doubt about 
what had to be done. The OMC 
had gone mad, a wild runaway 
consciousness. It had been a sick 
ball of gray matter whose mus- 
cles turned every servo on the 
ship into a murder weapon, who 
stared out at them with madness 
from every sensor, who raged 
gibberish at them from every 
vocoder. 

No, there’d been no doubt — 
not with three of their number 
murdered. The only wonder was 
that they’d been allowed to de- 
stroy it. 

Perhaps it wanted to die, Bic- 
kel thought. 

And he wondered if that had 
been the fate of the six other 
Project ships which had van- 
ished into the nothingness with- 
out a trace. 

Did their OMCs run wild? Did 
their umbilicus crews fail when 
it was kill or be killed? 



10 



GALAXY 



A tear began sliding down Tim- 
berlake’s left cheek. 

To Bickel, that was the final 
blow. Some of his anger returned. 
He faced Timberlake, said: 
“What do we do now, Cap- 
tain ?” 

The title’s irony wasn’t lost 
on either of Bickel’s companions. 
Flattery started to reply, thought 
better of it. If the starship Earth- 
ling could be said to have a 
captain (discounting an in-ser- 
vice Organic Mental Core) then 
unspoken agreement gave that ti- 
tle to an umbilicus crew’s life 
systems engineer. None of them, 
though, had ever used the word 
officially. 

At last, Timberlake met Bic- 
Icel’s stare, but all he said was: 
“You know why I couldn’t bring 
myself to do it.” 

Bickel continued to study 
Timberlake, measuring the man. 
What shabby conceit had given 
them this excuse for a life sys- 
tem engineer? Once the umbilicus 
crew had numbered six — the 
three here plus Ship Nurse Maida 
Blaine, Tool Specialist Oscar An- 
derson and Biochemist Sam Sche- 
ler. Now, Blaine, Anderson and 
Scheler were dead — Scheler’s 
exploded corpse jamming an ac- 
cess tube on the aft perimeter, 
Anderson strangled by a rogue 
sphincter lock and lovely Maida 
mangled by runaway cargo. 

Bickel blamed most of the 



tragedy on Timberlake. If the 
damn’ fool had only taken the 
ruthless but obvious step at the 
first sign of trouble. There’d 
been plenty of warning — with 
the first two of the ship’s three 
OMCs going catatonic. The seat 
of trouble had been obvious. 
And the symptoms — exactly the 
same symptoms that had pre- 
ceded the breakdown of the old 
Artificial Consciousness project 
back on earth — insane destruc- 
tion of people and material. But 
Tim had refused to see it. Tim 
had blathered about the sanctity 
of all life. 

Life, hah! Bickel thought. 
They were all of them — even 
the colonists down in the hyb 
tanks — - expendable biopsy ma- 
terial, Doppelgangers grown in 
gnotobiotic sterility in the Moon- 
base. “Untouched by human 
hands.” That’d been their pri- 
vate joke. They’d known their 
earth-born teachers only as 
voices and doll-size images on 
cathode screens of the base in- 
tercom system — and only oc- 
casionally through the triple 
glass at the locks that sealed off 
the sterile creche. They’d emerg- 
ed from the axolotl tanks to the 
padded metal claws of nurse- 
maids that were servo extensors 
of Moonbase personnel forever 
barred from intimate contact 
with those they served. 

Timberlake glanced around at 

11 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



the familiar room in the ship’s 
core — Command Central — a 
space twenty-seven meters long 
and twelve meters on the short 
axis. Like the ship, Com-central 
was vaguely egg-shaped. Four 
cocoon-like action couches with 
almost identical control boards 
lay roughly parallel in the curve 
of the room’s wider end. Color- 
coded pipes and wires, dials and 
instrument controls, switch banks 
and warning telltales spread pat- 
terned confusion against the gray 
metal walls. Here was the neces- 
sities for monitoring the ship and 
its autonomous consciousness — 
an Organic Mental Core. 

Organic Mental Core, Tim- 
berlake thought, and he felt the 
full return of his feelings of guilt 
a and grief. Not human brain, oh, 
no. An Organic Mental Core. 
Better yet, an OMC. The euph- 
emism makes it easier to forget 
that the core once was a human 
brain in an infant monster — 
doomed to die. We take only 
terminal cases since that makes 
the morality of the act less ques- 
tionable. 

And we killed it. 

tiT’ll tell you what I’m going 
to do,” Bickel said. He 
looked at the Accept-and-Trans- 
late board auxiliary to the trans- 
mitter on his personal control 
console. “I’m going to report 
back to Moonbase what’s hap- 

12 



pened.” He turned away franOj 

the raped panel, dropped the sev- 
ered feeder tube to the deck 
without looking at it. 

The tube drifted downward 
slowly in the ship’s quarter grav- 
ity. 

“We’ve no code for this . 
this kind of emergency,” Tim- 
berlake said. He moved to con- 
front Bickel, stared angrily at 
the man’s square face, dislik- 
ing every feature of it from the 
close- cropped blond hair to the 
wide mouth and pugnacious jaw. 

“I know,” Bickel said, stepped 
around Timberlake. “I’m send- 
ing it clear speech.” 

“You can’t do that!” Tim- 
berlake protested, turning to 
glare at Bickel’s back. 

“Every second’s delay adds to 
the timelag,” Bickel said. “As 
it is, it has to go more than a 
fourth of the way across the 
solar system.” He dropped into 
his couch, set the cocoon to half 
enclose him, swung the trans- 
mitter into position. 

“You’ll be blatting it to every- 
one on earth, including you- 
know-who!” Timberlake said. 

Because he half agreed with 
Timberlake and wanted to gain 
time, Flattery moved to a posi- 
tion looking down on Bickel on 
the couch, said: “What specifi- 
cally are you going to tell 
them?” 

“I’m not about to mince 

GALAXY 



words,” Bickel said. He threw 
the transmitter warmup switches, 
began checking the sequence 
tape. “I’m going to tell ’em we 
had to unhook the last brain 
from the ship’s controls . and 
kill it in the process.” 

“They’ll tell us to abort,” 
Timberlake said. 

The merest hesitation of his 
hands on the tape-punch key- 
board told that Bickel had 
heard. 

“And what’ll you say hap- 
pened to the brains?” Flattery 
asked. 

“They went nuts,” Bickel said. 
“I’m just going to report our cas- 
ualties.” 

“That’s not precisely what 
happened,” Flattery said. 

“We’d better talk this over,” 
Timberlake said, and he felt 
the beginnings of desperation. 

But Bickel threw the master 
switch. A skin-creeping hum 
filled Com-central as the laser 
amplifiers built up to full po- 
tential. 

I should stop him, Flattery 
thought as Bickel fed the voco- 
tape into the transmitter. But 
what good would that do? We 
have to get the message out and 
clear speech is the only way. 

There came the click-click- 
click as the message was com- 
pressed and multiplied for its 
laser-jump across the solar sys- 
tem. 



With a chopping motion that 
carried its own subtle betrayal of 
self doubt, Bickel slapped the 
orange transmitter key. He sank 
back as the transmit-command 
sequence took over. The sound 
of relays snapping closed domin- 
ated the ovoid room. 

Do something even if if s 
wrong, Flattery reminded him- 
self. The rule books don't work 
out here. And now it’s too late 
to stop Bickel. 

It came to Flattery then that 
it had been too late to stop Bic- 
kel from the moment their ship 
left its moon orbit. This direct- 
authoritarian-violent man (or 
one of his backups in the hyb 
tanks) held the key to the Earth- 
ling’s real purpose. The rest of 
them were just along for the 
ride. 

“How long d’you suppose it’ll 
take Moonbase to answer?” Bic- 
kel asked Timberlake. 

Flattery stiffened, studied the 
back of Bickel’s head. The ques- 
tion . such a nice balance of 
cameraderie and apology in the 
voice . Bickel had done that 
deliberately, Flattery realized. 
Bickel went deeper than they’d 
suspected, but perhaps they 
should’ve suspected. He was, af- 
ter all, the Earthling’s pivotal 
figure. 

“It’ll take ’em a while to digest 
it,” Timberlake said. “I still 
think we should’ve waited.” 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



13 



Wrong tack, Flattery thought. 
An overture should be accepted. 
He brushed a finger along one 
of his heavy eyebrows, moved 
forward with a calculated clum- 
siness, forcing them to be aware 
of him. 

“Their first question’ll be 
why’d the OMCs fail,” Timber- 
lake said. 

“There was no medical reason 
for it,” Flattery said. He realiz- 
ed he’d spoken too quickly, 
sensed his own defensiveness and 
added: “At least, as far as I 
could determine.” 

“It’ll turn out to be something 
new, something nobody antici- 
pated, wait and see,” Timberlake 
said. 

Something nobody anticipated? 
Bickel wondered. 

Still, six other ships had van- 
ished into silence out here — 
six other ships much like their 
Earthling. 

Timberlake adjusted a dial on 
his console to correct a failure 
of automatic temperature ad- 
justment in quad three ring nine 
of the ship’s second shell. “We 
should’ve been buttoned down 
in our hyb tanks and on our 
way over the solar hump to 
Tau Ceti long ago,” he mutter- 
ed. 

“Tim, display the timelog,” 
Flattery said. 

Timberlake hit the green key 
in the upper right comer of his 

14 



board, glanced at the overhead 
master screen’s display from the 
laser- pulse timelog. 

T en months — plus. 

The indefinite answer made it 
seem the Earthling’ s computer 
core shared their doubts. 

“How long to Tau Ceti?” Flat- 
tery asked. 

“At this rate?” Timberlake 
asked. He risked a long glance 
away from his board. The stare 
he aimed at Flattery betrayed 
the fact he hadn’t thought of 
that possibility, making the trip 
the hard way — long and slow 
with a crew active all the way. 

“Say four hundred years, give 
or take a few,” Bickel said. “It’s 
the first question I fed into the 
computer after we disabled the 
drive increment.” 

He’s too crystal sharp, Flat- 
tery thought. He bears watching 
lest he shatter. And Flattery 
chided himself then: But the job 
Bickel has to do requires a man 
who can shatter. 

“First thing we’d better do 
is bring up one replacement 
from the hyb tanks,” Bickel 
said. 

Flattery glanced to his left 
where the Com-central’s other 
three action couches lay with 
their cocoon arms open, empty 
and waiting. 

“Bring up only one replace- 
ment, eh?” Flattery asked. “Live 
in here?” 



GALAXY 



“We may need occasional 
sleep-rest periods in the cubby 
lockers,” Bickel said and he 
nodded toward the side hatch 
into their spartan living quar- 
ters. “But Com-central’s the 
safest spot on the ship.” 

“What if Project orders us to 
abort?” Timberlake asked. 

“That won’t be their first or- 
der,” Bickel said. “Seven na- 
tions invested one helluva pile of 
money and effort and dreams in 
this business. One nation might 
give up immediately . seven 
nations, no. It could take ’em 
months to reach any kind of 
agreement.” 

Too crystal sharp, Flattery 
thought. And he asked: “Who’re 
you nominating for dehyb?” 

“Prudence Weygand, M.D.,” 
Bickel said. 

“You think we need another 
doctor, eh?” Flattery asked. 

“I think we need Prudence 
Weygand, that’s all,” Bickel 
said. “She’s a doctor, sure, but 
she can also function as a nurse 
to replace . Maida. She’s 
a woman and we may need fe- 
male thinking in . .” 

“And if we have to make the 
trip the hard way,” Flattery said. 
He nodded. Yes, they’d have to 
breed replacements for the crew. 
Bickel was thinking ahead, plan- 
ning. 

“You have any objection to 
Weygand, Tim?” Bickel asked. 



“What’s my opinion worth?* 
Timberlake muttered. “You 
two’ve already decided it, haven’t 
you?” 

Bickel already had turned 
toward his own action couch. He 
hesitated at the sound of anger 
in Timber lake’s voice, then went 
on to the couch, pulled the full 
vacuum suit from the rack be- 
neath the couch and began suit- 
ing up. He spoke without turn- 
ing: “I’ll take over here then 
while you and Raj bring her out 
of hyb. You’d both better suit 
up, too, and stay suited from 
now on in. Without an OMC 
at the controls . well . .” He 
shrugged, finished sealing the 
suit and stretched out in his ac- 
tion couch. “I’ll take the red 
switch on the count.” 

Timberlake was caught up 
then in the change-over. The 
master board swung across on its 
travelers, stopped as it made 
junction with Bickel’s console. 

Bickel satisfied himself the 
ship was functioning as well as 
it could without the homeosta- 
tic control of an OMC. He sank 
back to watch the board as the 
others left Corn-central. The 
hatch seals hissed and there 
came the metallic slap of the 
magnetic locks as the hatch 
closed and resealed itself. 

Now, Bickel felt the ship 
around him as though he had 
neural connections to every sen- 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM?

sor revealed on his board. The 
Earthling lay spread out for him 
— a monstrous juggernaut . 
yet fragile as an egg. 

A Tin Egg. 

Among themselves, they’d call- 
ed it the Tin Egg from the 
moment someone had noted the 
homonym in the name of the 
ship’s Dutch-Siamese chief de- 
signer: Tien Aq. 

Something about the Tin Egg 
was sour — Big Sour. It didn’t 
make sense to Bickel that a man 
had to sit here in Com- central, 
the strain of responsibility in- 
creasing with each heartbeat, 
waiting and knowing some mech- 
anism or balancing function of 
the ship was headed for trouble 
—yet unable to meet the prob- 
lem with more than a gross, 
clumsy makeshift. 

With the OMCs, this ship bal- 
ance had been a finely tuned 
neuro-servo reflex, almost auto- 
matic — as homeostatic in re- 
sponse as a healthy human body. 

Bickel added his own question 
now to the long list that had 
been posed: Why were all the 
eggs put in one basket? 

II 

A s she awoke, she thought: 
We made it! Two hundred 
years across space and we made 
it! 

Excitement filled her at the 



thought of stepping out onto a 
virgin world with all its strange 
newness and never-before prob- 
lems. Six failures were worth it 
The seventh try was a charm. 
We’ve succeeded. Otherwise . 
otherwise . 

Her mind bogged down in 
sluggishness. Otherwise was a 
concept with several pathways 
out of it. 

The tingle-ache of dehyb ran 
along the muscles of her arms 
and legs, produced transient 
knots of pain. She knew as a 
doctor the reasons for the pain, 
could rationalize the fact of it: 
human hybernation was a far 
different process from animal 
hibernation. Not a drop of water 
could remain in the body — and 
you went so close to the borders 
of death that some contended 
you were suspended within 
death. The pains of dehyb could 
be explained easily enough, but 
no description was adequate. 
They had to be experienced to 
be understood. 

She tried to sit up. 

It was then she saw Timber- 
lake and Flattery looking down 
at her where she lay on the 
lab shuttle. Their expressions 
brought otherwise to full focus. 
For a moment, she looked be- 
yond them to the tubes and stim- 
ulant plugs that had been re- 
moved from functional contact 
with her body. 



16 



GALAXY 



Flattery restrained her. “Easy 
now, Dr. Weygand,” he said. 

Dr. Weygand, she thought. 
Not Prudence. Not Prue. 

She began losing that first ela- 
tion. 

Then Flattery began explain- 
ing in his soft, soothing voice 
and she knew her elation had to 
be put away. The contingency 
problem had arisen. She had 
been awakened for that. 

“Just tell me how many we 
lost,” she said, and her throat 
hurt from its months of disuse. 

Timberlake told her. 

“Three dead?” she said. She 
didn’t ask how they had died. 
The other problem, the contin- 
gency for which she had been 
prepared took precedence over 
mere curiosity. 

“Bickel requested you be 
brought out of hyb.” 

“Does he know why?” she 
asked, ignoring the strange look 
Timberlake shifted from her to 
Flattery. 

“He rationalized it,” Flattery 
said, and he wished she’d with- 
held these questions until they 
were alone. 

“Of course he did,” she said. 
“But has . .” 

“He hasn’t posed the problem 
yet,” Flattery said. 

“Don’t push him,” she said, 
and glanced at Timberlake. 
“Forget what you just heard 
here, Timberlake.” 



Timberlake scowled, suddenly 
withdrawn and wary. 

Flattery bent over her right 
arm with a slapshot hypo in his 
hand. 

“Must you?” she asked. Then: 
“Yes, of course.” 

“There’s nothing for you to do 
right now except recuperate,” he 
said, and pressed the slapshot 
against her arm. 

She felt the mechanism’s kick 
and, presently, the soft spread 
of narcosis. Flattery and Tim- 
berlake became wavering fig- 
ures haloed in light. 

At least Bickel’ s still alive, 
she thought. We won’t have to 
replace him with a backup — take 
second best. 

And just before sinking into 
the downy cloud of sleep, she 
wondered: How did Maida die? 
Lovely Maida who . 

npimberlake watched the film 
of withdrawal wash over her 
light blue eyes. Her breathing 
took on soft regularity. 

As life systems specialist, 
Timberlake had checked the 
computer-filed tape flag for ev- 
ery person on the Tin Egg. He 
recalled that Prudence Weygand 
was classed superb as a sur- 
geon — “Superior 9 in tool facil- 
ity.” And the scale went only to 
10. He reflected on her strange 
conversation with Flattery and 
realized the tape hadn’t told the 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



17 



full story. She obviously had 
ship functions beyond surgeon- 
ecologist . and at least one of 
these functions concerned Bickel. 

“Forget what you just heard 
here, Timberlake.” 

Timberlake could still hear 
that cold-voiced command and 
he knew it didn’t square with 
the emotional index on Prudence 
Weygand’s tapes. There she was 
listed as “Place nine-d green” 
on the compassionate vector. In 
the close-quarters living of this 
umbilicus crew, that emotional 
index posed problems because of 
its tightly linked sex drive. With 
a sense of shock, Timberlake 
took a closer look at her feed- 
tube spectrum on the hyb chart, 
saw that she’d been fed the sex 
suppressant anti-S drugs even 
under hyb. She’d been kept 
ready. 

Ready tor what? he asked 
himself. 

Flattery closed and locked her 
litter cocoon, said: “She’ll sleep 
until she’s almost back to nor- 
mal. We’d better check her size 
now, too, and get her a full-vac 
suit out of stores. She’ll need it 
when she comes out.” 

Timberlake nodded, made a 
last check on the few remaining 
life-systems linkages into her 
litter. Flattery was acting very 
odd. Mysterious. 

“You can ignore all that con- 
versation as she woke up,” Flat- 

18 



tery said. “Common dehyb con- 
fusion. You know how it is.” 

But she was fed anti-S drugs in 
hybernation , Timberlake thought 

Flattery nodded toward the 
hatch into Com-central, said: 
“John’s been almost four hours 
alone on the board. Time he got 
some relief.” 

Timberlake finished his inspec- 
tion of the litter gauges, turned, 
led the way through the hatch. 

Seeing the wary, thoughtful 
look on Timberlake’s face, Flat- 
tery thought: Damn that wom- 
an’s big mouth. If Tim says the 
wrong thing to Bickel now it 
could muddy the whole project. 

T>ickel heard Flattery and Tim- 
berlake enter Com-central, 
but was forced to keep his atten- 
tion on the big board. An odd 
timed pulse had appeared in the 
primary loops of the navigation- 
al analogue banks of the com- 
puter. It appeared and vanished 
with no apparent cause. 

Timberlake came up beside 
Bickel, studied the gauge which 
showed the timed pulse in the 
navigational analogue banks. 

“That acts like a Doppler ref- 
erence pulse from the timelog,” 
he said. “You been checking our 
position?” 

“No,” Bickel said, and as he 
spoke the answer to this var- 
iant pulse clicked home in his 
mind. He had set up a telltale 



GALAXY 



warning net in the computer to 
alert him when ship damage 
reached a critical point. Dam- 
age to the navigational system 
could be most critical — especial- 
ly internal damage. But unlike 
destruction of hardware, that in- 
ternal damage would only betray 
itself by position errors. His tell- 
tale circuitry had alerted one of 
the ship computer’s master pro- 
grams. A running Doppler ref- 
erence check was being made on 
their position. 

Bickel shifted to the computer 
board, ran a series trial on the 
navigational loops, read the in- 
duced resonance off the pulsing 
gauges. It checked. 

He explained what was hap- 
pening. 

“The computer acts . .al- 
most . human,” Flattery said. 

Bickel and Timberlake ex- 
changed a knowing smile. Al- 
most human, indeed! The damn’ 
thing merely was doing what it 
was designed to do. Bickel had 
just overlooked the fact that this 
was in the design. 

“We’d better take the com- 
puter schematics and design 
specs and have a real skull ses- 
sion on what the lack of an 
OMC may be doing to it,” Tim- 
berlake said. 

Bickel nodded. 

He was thankful then that 
Timberlake was, in many re- 
spects, as good an electronics man 



as anyone on the ship — the neces- 
sary foundation for his specialty. 
There was always that almost 
qualification on his abilities, 
though. Life systems work 
trapped a man into a “general- 
ist” corner. They knew plenty 
of biophysics, but they weren’t 
doctors. They were adept in 
electronics, but fell short of that 
smooth juggling of variables 
which marked the true adept. 

“You ready for a break, 
John?” Flattery asked. 

“Any time. How’s Prue?” 

“Doctor Weygand is asleep 
now,” Flattery said. “She needs 
a few more hours recuperation.” 

Why's he so formal? Bickel 
wondered. Raj must know I 
shared classes with her. She was 
always Prue then . Why should 
she suddenly he Doctor Wey- 
gand? 

“I’ll take the board on the 
count,” Flattery said, and they 
began the change of watch. 

Timberlake, sensing Bickel’s 
questions, realized that Flat- 
tery’s emphasis on Doctor Wey- 
gand had not been aimed at the 
electronics engineer. 

Raj was saying something to 
me, Timberlake thought. He was 
telling me that Doctor Weygand 
may’ve had medical reasons for 
her strange behavior. Raj is tell- 
ing me to keep my mouth shut. 
And Timberlake found himself 
resenting the fact that Flattery 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



19 



had found the warning neces- 
sary. 

T)ickel closed off his link to the 
^ controls, slipped off his 
couch and began exercising the 
stiffness out of his muscles. Re- 
membering the classes he’d 
shared with Prue Weygand — 
computer math, servo-sensor re- 
pair, ship function — he recalled 
the woman. She was a disturbing 
female-plus creature, sensitive 
and with her feelings all too ap- 
parent. Bickel realized then that 
a photograph of Prue Weygand 
in repose would show a rather 
unassuming woman with regular 
features and a good, but not sen- 
sational figure. She was the kind 
who attracted male stares, 
though. She radiated some vital, 
sparking thing — especially when 
she walked. 

Is that why I chose her? 
Bickel wondered. He broke off 
his exercises to consider the 
question. The Prue kind of wom- 
an presented a source of trouble 
in anotherwise all-male crew — 
unless they all went on anti-S. 
But they couldn’t afford to dull 
their faculties that way. 

Bickel forced this out of his 
mind by looking around Corn- 
central, focusing his attention on 
the ship — Tien Aq’s “Tin Egg.” 
The ship cum computer cum hy- 
bernating colonists — here was 
one set of resources that Bickel 



felt they could fit into a logical 
pigeonhole, assess and weigh and 
use as they needed. 

He sensed the ship stretching 
out from him in its sixteen con- 
centric shells: a great ovoid bulk 
almost a mile across its long 
axis. Beyond the water barrier 
and baffles that shielded the 
core lay miles of corridors and 
tubeways, self-sealing compart- 
ments. Through it all stretched 
the organized clutter of mater- 
ial expected to make life pos- 
sible for humans in an alien en- 
vironment. 

In the hyb tanks they had two 
thousand adult humans, a thou- 
sand embryos and more than 
six thousand animal embryos — 
“a full ecological spectrum.” 
Bickel turned, looked at his 
own computer board. Logic told 
him their main chance of sur- 
vival lay in the computer. His 
plan involved dangerous risk to 
the computer, but the risk was 
necessary. The others might fight 
him, but they have to come 
around. 

(, 1 T T ow long until Prue will be 
-*■ with us?” he asked. 
“About three hours,” Timber- 
lake said. 

“I want, her opinion on the 
post mortem,” Bickel said. “I’m 
not satisfied with what we found 
in the first two brains.” 

Timberlake shut down his 



20 



GALAXY 



couch massage, directed a prob- 
ing stare at Bickel. 

“I went through the entire 
console when Brain One failed,” 
he said. “Check it yourself.” 

“I did,” Bickel said. “A couple 
of things bothered me. Brain One 
preferred to be called Myrtle. 
Why? I find nothing in the 
memory core to diplain that — 
except that Brain One was re- 
moved from a genetic monster 
that probably was female.” 
“Myrtle’s personal life system 
tested within .0002 of homeo- 
static center on the Anders 
Base,” Timberlake said. “Her re- 
serve life systems were in stasis 
and precisely on the base.” 
“Don’t let that identity pref- 
erence seduce you,” Flattery 
said. “It was for our benefit — so 
we could anthropomorphize the 
ship-OMC.” 

“Yeah,” Bickel said. “That’s 
the reason they each gave, but 
is it the right one?” 

“Those brains were as perfect 
as any ever bom,” Flattery 
said, and he wondered why he 
allowed Bickel’s attitude to ir- 
ritate him. “Okay, they were 
raised from infancy as part of 
the total ship-sensor-servo sys- 
tem. So what? They didn’t know 
any other life or want . .” 
“You said a couple of things 
were bothering you,” Timber- 
lake interrupted. “What’s the 
other one?” 



“Your life systems report,” 
Bickel said, “entry 91007 on 
Myrtle. It says: ‘None of the 
systems appear then to have 
been at fault.’ Why’d you use 
that word appear, Tim? You 
have some doubts you couldn’t 
enter in the report?” 

“Not a damn’ one!” Timber- 
lake said. “Those systems were 
perfect!” 

“Then why didn’t you just 
say so?” 

“He was only being cautious,” 
Flattery said. “If you’ve checked 
the records, you’ll find my med- 
ical report confirms his findings 
in every respect.” 

“Except one,” Bickel said. 

“And what is that?” Timber- 
lake asked. He glared at Bickel, 
his face flushed. A muscle 
worked along his jaw. 

Bickel ignored the signs of an- 
ger, said: “Nothing explains the 
internal burn damage that Raj 
found in those brains. ‘Internal 
bum damage,’ you say, ‘espec- 
ially along the overlarge axon 
collaterals of the afferent side.’ 
What the devil do you mean 
overlarge? Overlarge compared 
to what?” 

“A main channel leading into 
the brain’s higher centers was 
about four times the size of any- 
thing I’d ever seen,” Flattery 
said. “I don’t know why, but i 
can guess it was compensatory 
growth. These OMCs had to 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



21 



handle many more incoming 
data bits from more sensors than 
the normal human ever encoun- 
ters. You’ll note that the frontal 
lobes were larger, too, but . 

“The design specs on the 
OMC process explain all that,” 
Bickel said. “Compensatory 
growth, yeah, but I don’t find 
word one about large axon col- 
laterals. Not word one.” 

“These brains had been in the 
system longer than any others 
ever examined,” Timberlake 
said. “The literature only reports 
on four previously that died of 
natural causes.” 

“ Natural causes?” Bickel 

asked. “What’s a natural cause 
fatal to an OMC?” 

“You know as well as I do,” 
Flattery said. “Accidents. Ir- 
ritant matter in the food bath. 
A radiation shield left down. But 
you’ll notice that the last words 
from each betrayed a type of 
deterioration akin to schizo . .” 
“Akin!” Bickel sneered. “That’s 
what you see all through these 
damn’ reports: “Something sim- 
ilar to . .’ ‘A condition that 
reminds one of . .’ ‘Akin to . .’ ” 
He glared from Flattery to Tim- 
berlake: “The truth is we don’t 
know what the hell goes on in an 
OMC’s gray matter.” 

A clicking-buzzing erupted 
from the master board above 
Flattery. 

Bickel waited while Flattery 



fought out a manual temper- 
ature adjustment in an inner 
hold. Presently, Flattery wiped 
perspiration from his forehead, 
studied his gauges to be certain 
the balance was holding. 

“Man, that board’s murder,” 
Timberlake muttered. “I don’t 
wonder those OMCs caved in.” 
Flattery risked a glance away 
from the board, said: “You know 
better than that, Tim. This part 
of the job was child’s play for a 
functioning OMC. They could 
handle most ship homeostasis 
problems by something akin to 
reflex action.” 

“Akin,” Bickel said. 

“All right!” Flattery barked. 
“I was just saying — ” 

He broke off as the Master 
board grew three diagonal stripes 
of flashing yellow. Flattery’s 
hands darted to the controls as 
Bickel shouted: “Grav shift!” 

and dove for his couch. 

Cocoon snapped closed around 
them and they felt the creeping, 
jerking weight shifts, the run- 
away fluctuation of the field - 
centering system — the unex- 
plained gravity variance that had 
killed Maida. 

B ickel watched Flattery’s hands 
fight the system back in- 
to balance with a surgeon’s 
sureness. The tugging and jerk- 
ing began to ease. Presently, 
Flattery made a fine, adjustment

in the centering controls, took 
up as though there’d been no 
interruption. “Myrtle, you will 
recall, said: ‘I have no incarna- 
tion.’ That may have been the 
only accurate thing in her jab- 
bering. After all, except for gray 
matter, she had no flesh. But 
then, remember, after a long 
silence she said: ‘I’m counting 
my fingers.’ She had no fingers, 
no conscious memory of fingers. 
And that final question: ‘Why 
are you all so dead?’ The best 
guess is that any meaning in 
these statements and questions 
was purely accidental.” 

“I think she was referring to 
us, to the crew,” Bickel said. 
“It’s nuts, yes, but it was a direct 



question over the vocoders and 
we were the only possible au- 
dience.” 

“Unless she was referring to 
the colonists in the hyb tanks,” 
Flattery said. “They might ap- 
pear dead under some . .” 
“Myrtle had direct contact 
with the hyb tank sensors,” 
Timberlake said. “She’d have 
known if they were alive.” 
Bickel nodded, said: “What 
do you make of Little Joe roar- 
ing over every vocoder in the 
ship: ‘I’m awake! God help me, 
I’m awake!” 

“A cry for help, perhaps,” 
Flattery said. “Most insane rav- 
ing is a cry for help in one form 
or another.” 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



23 



“That leaves Harvey,” Bickel 
said. “Harvey screamed: ‘You’re 
forcing me to be unhealthy.’ ” 

“Easy does it,” Flattery said. 
“That was just another non- 
sense statement.” 

“We all knew what it meant, 
though,” Bickel said. “I didn’t 
see anybody showing surprise 
when Harvey said; ‘I’ve lost it!’ 
and signed off . permanently. 
We’d been expecting it; you 
know that. And there we were 
with three dead brains and no 
spares.” 

The bald, callous way Bickel 
put it sent a shuddering sadness 
through Timberlake and he 
couldn’t explain it. He’d never 
been deeply attached to the 
OMCs. There’d always been 
something faintly accusing about 
the “ship creatures.” Raja Flat- 
tery had assured him this was 
strictly subjective, something 
from his own attitudes. Raj had 
always been so positive that the 
OMC - ship - computer entities 
were perfectly reconciled to 
their way of life, happy with 
their own compensations. 

What compensations? Timber- 
lake wondered. Expectancy of 
long life? But what’s three or 
four thousand years of living if 
each year is hell? 

Oharp, heavy G force pressed 
^ him against the side of his 
couch cocoon. It struck without 

24 



klaxon warning or alarm light. 
Cocoon safety locks sealed home. 
Now, red alarm lights flashed 
with the yellow in long webs 
across the master board. 

Flattery slammed the gravity 
disconnect with the heel of his 
left hand. G force ebbed. Yellow 
alarm lights winked off as their 
pressure switches released. A 
line of red alarm lights re- 
mained. 

“Damage to hull three, section 
six-fourteen,” Flattery said. He 
began activating remote sensors 
to inspect the area. 

Without conscious thought or 
discussion, Bickel took over ship 
command, said: “Tim, take the 
G repeaters. Leave gravity dis- 
connected while you trace the 
relays and get the system back 
in balance.” 

Timberlake pulled his board 
close to obey. 

Bickel swung the AAT board 
to his side, keyed for ship sys- 
tems-computers control, began 
feeding coded demands into the 
core recorders. What had the 
ship encountered that might ex- 
plain that brutal deflection? 
What had the automatic sensors 
recorded? 

The responders began kicking 
out tape almost immediately — 
much too fast. 

“Data error,” Flattery said, 
reading the output over Bickel’s 
shoulder. 



GALAXY 



In abrupt fury, Bickel pulled 
the master override stop from 
his core switch, jammed a set of 
jumper packs across the AAT 
controls, opened the core sys- 
tem for standard reference com- 
parison. 

“You’re into the core!” Flat- 
tery said, his voice sharp with 
fear. “You’ve no guide fuse or 
master reference. You could 
louse up the command routines.” 

“Unhook that!” Timberlake 
shouted, lifting his head from the 
cocoon clamps to glare across at 
Bickel. 

“Shut up, both of you,” Bickel 
said. “Sure, the core’s delicate, 
but something in there’s already 
loused up — bad enough to kill 
us.” 

“You think you’ve time to 
check some eight hundred thou- 
sand routines?” Timberlake de- 
manded. “Don’t talk nuts!” 

“There’re specific injunctions 
against what you’re doing,” Flat- 
tery said, fighting to keep his 
voice reasonable. “And you 
know why.” 

“Don’t try to tell me my job,” 
Bickel said. 

While he spoke, Bickel rolled 
over core memory responders, 
direct contact, doing it gently to 
avoid current backlash. 

“You make one mistake,” 
Timberlake said, “and it’d take 
six or seven thousand techni- 
cians with a second master sys- 



tem and several thousand im- 
print relays to repair the dam- 
age. Are you ready to . .” 

“Stop distracting me,” Bickel 
said. 

“What’re you looking for?” 
Flattery asked, interested in 
spite of his fear. He had real- 
ized that Bickel, conditioned to 
deep inhibitions against turn- 
ing back, was incapable of do- 
ing anything to deprive them of 
one of their basic tools. 

“I’m checking availability of 
peripherals from the core mem- 
ory,” Bickel said. “There’s got 
to be a bypass or pile-up some- 
where. It’ll show in the acquisi- 
tion and phase- control loops of 
the input.” He nodded toward a 
diagnostic meter on his board. 
“And here we are!” The meter’s 
needle slammed against its pin, 
fell back to zero, stayed there. 

Qlowly, Bickel ordered a master 
^ diagnostic routine into di- 
rect contact, forced the routine 
through the data reference chan- 
nels as modified by new sensor 
input. 

Error branchings began click- 
ing from his responders. Bickel 
translated aloud as the code fig- 
ures appeared on the screen. 

“Core memory /prediction re- 
gion rendered inactive. Proton 
mass and scatter relative to ship 
course/mass/speed did not agree 
with prediction.”

Aside, Bickel said: “We’re hit- 
ting something other than hy- 
drogen and hitting it in unex- 
pected concentrations — partly 
because of our speed/mass fig- 
ure.” 

“Solar winds,” Timberlake 
whispered. “They said we . .” 
“Solar winds, hell!” Bickel 
•aid. “Look at that.” He nodded 
at a code grouping as it worked 
its way across the screen. 

“Twenty-six protons in the 
mass,” Timberlake said. 

“Iron,” Bickel said. “Free 
atoms of iron out here. We’re 
getting a plain old-fashioned 
magnetic deflection of the grav 
field.” 

“We’ll have to slow the ship,” 
Timberlake said. 

“Nuts!” Bickel said. “We’ll put 
a fused overload breaker in the 
G system. I don’t see why the 
devil the designers didn’t do 
that in the first place.” 

“Perhaps they couldn’t con- 
ceive of any force large enough 
to deflect the system,” Flattery 
said. 

“No doubt,” Bickel said, his 
voice heavy with disgust. “But 
when I think a simple cage 
switch with a weight in it could 
have prevented Maida’s death.” 
“They depended on the 
OMC’s reflexes, too,” Flattery 
said. “You know that.” 

“What I know is they thought 
in straight lines when they 

26 



should’ve been thinking in the 
round,” Bickel said. 

He unlocked his safety cocoon, 
shifted his suit to portable, 
launched himself diagonally 
across Com -central to the Tool 
& Repair hatch. The weightless 
drifting reminded him they had 
a time limit on returning to 
gravity conditions. Too long 
without gravity and the crew 
would suffer permanent physical 
damage. They had perhaps an 
other hour and a half to be on 
the safe side. 

Bickel grabbed the hatch 
handle, swung out the repair 
traveler. He worked silently, 
angrily, with swift, decisive 
movements and presently had a 
cage switch clamped beside the 
main power cable into the grav 
ity generator. He made the con- 
nections to the breaker, tested 
the circuits with a false load, 
replaced the cover plate. 

“It’ll have to be reset man 
ually each time,” he said. He 
put a foot against the bulkhead, 
propelled himself back to his 
couch, locked in, glanced at 
Timberlake. “System balanced?” 

“Near as you can tell from 
here,” Timberlake said. “Give it 
a try, Raj.” 

Flattery checked to see that 
both Timberlake and Bickel 
were sealed in their cocoons, 
closed the gravity switch. The 
sound of the generators building 



GALAXV 



up grew to a faint hiss that sub- 
sided as the system stabilized. 
Flattery felt the pressure against 
his sboulderblades, reached up 
to the board, slowly refined Tim- 
berlake’s settings. 

“Tim,” Bickel said, “I want 
the schematics for the OMC 
chamber — every sensor-tie cod- 
ed for function — and laid out in 
layers from gross to fine. I’ll 
need the same thing for servo 
control, a complete . .” 

“Why?” Timberlake asked. 

“Are you thinking of tieing in 
a colonist’s brain?” Flattery de- 
manded, trying to hide his feel- 
ings of increasing outrage at the 
idea. 

“A mature human brain prob- 
ably wouldn’t survive such a 
transfer,” Timberlake said. And 
he felt shame at how much the 
thought had appealed to him. 
Every inhibition of his training 
cried out against such a move. 
But if the OMC system were re- 
stored, none of them here ever 
again would have to undergo the 
nerve- crushing responsibility of 
that Corn-central master board. 

“What the hell!” Bickel snap- 
ped. “Where’d you two get that 
idea? Not from anything I — 
said.” 

He broke off as the high 
pitched hummm-buzzz-hummm 
of the AAT receiver filled the 
room, alerting them that a mes- 
sage was being processed. 



'T'he message-ready chime 
sounded. Bickel keyed the 
vocoder. The voice of Morgan 
Hempstead, United Moonbase 
director, rolled out of the speak- 
ers, recognizable and still with 
its iced iron overtones preserved 
by the AAT’s comparators. 

“To UMB ship Earthling from 
Project Control. This is Morgan 
Hempstead. We hope you under- 
stand our distress and concern. 
Every decision from this point 
must have a prime motive of 
preserving the lives of yourselves 
and the colonists.” 

So much for the record, Flat- 
tery thought. There are seven 
nations and lour races represent- 
ed in the hyb tanks — but all just 
as expendable as the ones who 
went before us. 

“We have several prime ques- 
tions,” Hempstead said. 

I’ve a few questions of my 
own, Bickel thought. 

“Why was Project Control not 
alerted when the first Organic 
Mental Core failed?” Hempstead 
asked. 

Bickel mentally logged the 
question. He knew the answer, 
but it was nothing he’d ever 
transmit. Hempstead knew it as 
well as he did. The Tin Egg had 
momentum as an idea that had 
survived six failures. Noth- 
ing short of another ultimate 
failure would stop it. Nothing 
short of desperate emergency 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



27 



could make them risk aborting 
the mission by calling for help. 

“Doppler reference indicates 
you’ll be out of the solar system 
in approximately three hundred 
and sixteen days at present sta- 
bilized speed,” Hempstead said. 
“Time to Tau Ceti: four hun- 
dred-plus years.” 

As he listened, Bickel pictured 
the man behind the voice: flint- 
like face with gray hair and 
gray-blue eyes — that aura of 
momentous decision even in his 
smallest gesture. The psych boys 
had called him “Big Daddy” be- 
hind his back, but they’d jumped 
when he commanded. Now, 
Bickel focused on the fact that 
they never again expected to see 
Hempstead, yet the man still 
could reach into their midst with 
his decisions. 

“First analysis indicates these 
possibilities,” Hempstead said. 
“You could turn back to orbit 
around UMB until the problem 
is solved and new Organic Men- 
tal Cores installed. That would 
return us to the old problem of 
sterile control under less than 
ideal conditions. It also would 
remove the ship from the situa- 
tion of probable cause in the 
OMC breakdowns, perhaps 
making solution impossible.” 

“He always was a long-winded 
bore,” Timberlake said. 

“Second possibility,” Hemp- 
stead said, “would be for you to 

28 



convert to a closed ecology and 
continue at present speed, en- 
listing replacements from your 
hybernation tanks or breeding 
and raising your own crew com- 
plement. However, food would 
be a major problem unless you 
adopted a more closely inte- 
grated recycling system.” 

“Closely integrated recycling,” 
Flattery said. “He means can- 
nibalism. It was discussed.” 
Bickel turned to stare at Flat- 
tery. The idea of cannibalism 
was repellant, but that wasn’t 
what had caught Bickel’s atten- 
tion. “It was discussed.” That 
simple statement contained vol- 
umes of unanswered questions 
and hidden implications. 

“Third possibility,” Hemp- 
stead said, “would be to build 
the necessary consciousness into 
your robo-pilot, using the ship 
computer as a basis. Our compu- 
tations indicated you have suf- 
ficient materials, including neu- 
ron packages intended for colony 
robots in your stores. This is 
theoretically feasible.” 

“Theoretically feasible!” Tim- 
berlake sneered. “Does he think 
we’ve never heard about all the 
failures in . .” 

“Shhhh,” Flattery hissed. 
“Project Council suggests you 
continue present course and 
speed,” Hempstead said, “as 
long as you are within the solar 
system. If a solution has not 



GALAXY 



been reached by then, present 
opinion is that you will be or- 
dered to turn back.” There fol- 
lowed a long silence, then: . 

unless you have alternative sug- 
gestions.” 

“Fou will be ordered to turn 
back," Flattery thought. He 
turned to see how those key 
words sat with Bickel. They were 
aimed at Bickel, contrived for 
him, fitted specially to trigger his 
deepest motives. 

Bickel lay in thoughtful si- 
lence staring up at the speech 
microscope display above the 
vocoder, checking the accuracy 
of message reception. 

“At this time,” Hempstead 
said, “Project Control requires 
a detailed report on condition of 
all ship systems with special ref- 
erence to hybernating colonists. 
It is recognized that prolonging 
the voyage increases probability 
of hybernation failure. We 
recognize that you must replace 
crew losses from the tanks. Sug- 
gestions on replacements will be 
made upon request. We share 
your grief at the unfortunate ac- 
cidents among you, but the 
Project must continue.” 

“Detailed report on all ship 
systems,” Timberlake sneered. 
“He’s out of his mind.” 

How cold was Hempstead’s 
commiseration, Flattery thought. 
The phrasing betrayed the care 
with which it had been com- 



posed. Just enough grief; not too 
much. 

The vocoder emitted a filter- 
dulled crackling, then: “This is 
Morgan Hempstead closing 
transmission. Acknowledge and 
answer our questions immediate- 
ly. UMB out.” 

“They left too much unsaid,” 
Bickel said. And he sensed 
there’d been “deletions for rea- 
sons of policy” all through the 
message. The thin political line 
they walked had been betrayed 
most in what was not said. 

“Build consciousness into our 
computer,” Timberlake growled. 
“How stupid can they get?” He 
glanced at Bickel. “You were 
on one of the original attempts 
at UMB, John. You get the 
honor of telling ‘Big Daddy’ 
where he can shove that idea.” 

“That attempt flopped and 
badly,” Bickel agreed. “But it’s 
still the only real course open 
to us.” 

Timberlake raged on as 
though he hadn’t heard: “There 
were people on the UMB fiasco 
who make us look like a pack of 
amateurs.” 

Flattery had heard, though, 
and he hid a knowing smile by 
turning away and speaking mild- 
ly: “We all read the report.” 

“The only part worth reading 
was their summation,” Timber- 
lake said. He pitched his voice 
in a sneering falsetto: “ ‘Impos- 



ed I WAKE OR DREAM? 



29 



IV 



sible of achievement at present 
level of technology’ ” 

“That was an excuse, not a 
summation,” Bickel said. And 
he thought back to UMB’s fruit- 
less search for the artificial 
Consciousness Factor. There’d 
always been that sterile wall be- 
tween his part of the group and 
the Station personnel, but the 
triple-glass walls had never hid- 
den the smell of failure. It’d 
been all around the project from 
the beginning. They’d been lost 
in tangles of pseudoneuron fiber, 
in winking lights and the snap 
of relays, the hiss of tape reels 
and the bitter ozone smell of 
burnt insulation from overload- 
ed circuits. They’d looked for a 
mechanical way to do what the 
least among them could do with- 
in his own flesh — be conscious. 

And they’d failed. 

Over them all had hung the 
unspoken fear, the knowledge of 
what’d happened to the one proj- 
ect that reportedly had achieved 
success . and its own doom 
. back on the surface of earth. 

Timberlake cleared his throat, 
lifted a hand out of his couch 
cocoon, studied his fingernails 
and picked up the threads of 
a previous conversation: “There 
was no physical reason for those 
brains to fail. The life systems 
were perfect. It’s as though they 
committed suicide . under 
some unknown stress.” 



Qhe had come into Com- central 
^ still feeling weak and dis- 
oriented. It was obvious that the 
shift of dominance had gone fas- 
ter than expected, though, and 
she had forced herself to over- 
come her body’s weaknesses, 
putting on a mask of well-being 
and composure that she did not 
feel. 

The ovoid Com-central room 
should not have confused her — 
she had put in too many hours 
of training among these dials and 
gauges and pipes and keyboard 
consoles before their departure 
— but the feeling of unfamiliar- 
ity persisted. Then, as aware- 
ness increased, she saw the 
subtle changes in connections 
and controls and readouts, rec- 
ognized Bickel’s handiwork. 

All the changes were necessary 
to put the ship on manual, she 
realized, but she could feel the 
inadequacies of what had been 
done. 

It was then she realized the 
thin edge they walked, and she 
turned her attention to Flattery 
who was finishing out his shift 
on the big board. The signs of 
strain were obvious in his move- 
ments — still exact with a sur- 
geon’s sureness, but the control 
betrayed its thinning energy in 
the way he relaxed abruptly after 
each adjustment of the board. 



30 



GALAXY 



He should be relieved now, she 
thought, but she knew she was 
not yet ready to have that green 
dial point down at her, and she 
wasn’t sure of the conditions of 
Bickel and Timberlake. 

Timberlake radiated glum si- 
lence. 

“Moonbase is taking longer to 
answer this time than it did be- 
fore,” she said. 

“They’re too busy trying to 
decide what our reply really 
means,” Bickel said. “And I 
gave ’em some questions to an- 
swer.” 

“Or they could be figuring out 
how to tell us we’ve bitten off 
more’n we can chew,” Timber- 
lake said. 

She heard the fear in his voice, 
said: “Raj has been on that 

board over four hours. Isn’t it 
time somebody spelled him, 
Tim?” 

Flattery knew what she was 
doing, but couldn’t prevent the 
feeling of tension from gripping 
his spine. There was always the 
possibility Timberlake couldn’t 
take this. 

Timberlake felt the dryness in 
his mouth. Naturally, she’d as- 
sume he was giving orders here. 
He was the life systems man. 
She hadn’t volunteered to take 
the board, either . the bitch. 
But maybe it was too soon after 
de-hyb. Metabolisms differed. 
She’d know her own capacities, 



certainly. Besides, she was 
scheduled to follow Bickel on the 
board in the normal rotation. 

His glance followed the Corn- 
central track, the way the board 
circled around their positions. 
Bickel was in number one spot, 
then Prue, then Flattery — and 
he sat here on the end. 

It’s my watch, Timberlake 
told himself. 

He felt perspiration start in his 
palms. 

He’s taking too long, Flattery 
thought, and he said: “I’ll give 
you the board on the count, 
Tim. I’m wearing pretty thin.” 

Before Timberlake could pro- 
test, the count had started and 
his hand went automatically to 
the big red switch. Board and 
arrow came to him. Necessities 
of the job caught him imme- 
diately. Almost a third of the 
shield temperature control need- 
ed trimming to bring it into bet- 
ter balance. 

We should trace out the OMC 
linkages for this and install 
automatics for the gross part of 
the job, he thought. 

Presently, he fell into the 
routine of the watch and realized 
he’d be able to take his four 
hours ... at least. 

T)rudence was studying Bickei’s 
displays and stacks of sche- 
matics. She had followed enough 
of what he was doing there to 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



31 



combine that with the program- 
ming he had handed her and 
conclude one major fact. The de- 
vice he proposed would yield 
products of the Hermit e poly- 
nomials and Laguerre co-effi- 
cients of the past of the inputs. It 
was the same old self-reflexive 
circle every time they faced this 
problem — where did the circle 
of consciousness begin? 

“Maybe I can handle it,” she 
said — “if youll define con- 
sciousness for me.” 

“We’ll leave that up to the 
bigdomes at UMB,” Bickel said. 

“We’re not going to touch the 
inner communications lines of 
the computer. Our auxiliary 
will go into it through a one-way 
channel, fused against back- 
lash.” 

“And there’s no way for this 
auxiliary to run wild?” Flattery 
asked. 

“Its supervisory program will 
always be one of us,” Bickel 
said, fighting to keep irritation 
from his voice. “One of us will 
always be in the driver’s seat. 
We’ll drive it — like an ox pull- 
ing a wagon.” 

“This ox won’t have any ideas 
of its own, eh?” Flattery asked. 

“Not unless we solve the con- 
sciousness problem,” Bickel said. 

“Ngaaa!” 

Flattery’s word pounced. 

“And when it’s conscious, what 
then?” he asked. 

32 



Bickel blinked at him, ab- , 
sorbing this. Presently, he said: 
“I . suppose it’ll be like a 
newborn baby ... in a sense." 

“What baby was ever bora 
with all the information and . 
stored experiences of this ship’s 
master computer?” Flattery de- ! 
manded. 

Bickel’ s being fed this too fast. 
Prudence thought. If he’s kept 
too much off balance he may 
rebel or start to probe in the 
wrong places. He mustn’t guess. 

“Well . the human is bom 
with instincts,” Bickel said. “And 
we do train the human baby into 
. humanity.” 

“I find the moral and religious 
aspects of this whole idea faint- 
ly repugnant,” Flattery said. “I 
think there’s sin here. If not hub- 
ris, then something equally evil.” 

Prudence stared at him. Flat- 
tery betrayed signs of real agi- 
tation — a flush, in his cheeks, 
fingers trembling, eyes bright 
and glaring. 

That wasn’t in the program, 
she thought. Perhaps he’s tired. 

Flattery shifted his attention 
from Bickel to Prudence and 
back. He found it increasingly 
difficult to hide his resentment 
of Bickel. 

Psychiatrist, heal thyself, he 
thought. Bickel has to take 
charge. I’m just the safety fuse. 

Flattery glanced at the false 
plate on his personal repeater 



GALAXY 



board, thinking of the trigger be- 
neath that plate and the mate 
to it in his quarters concealed by 
the lines of the sacred graphic 
on the bulkhead. 

"Arbitrary turn-back com- 
mand ,” Flattery reminded him- 
self. That was the code signal he 
must listen for from UMB. That 
was the signal he must obey— 
unless he judged the ship had to 
be destroyed before receiving 
that signal. 

A simple push on one of the 
hidden triggers would activate 
the master program in the ship’s 
computer, open air locks, set off 
explosive charges. Death and de- 
struction for crew, ship, all the 
colonists and their supplies. 

Colonists and their supplies! 
Flattery thought. 

He was too good a psychiatrist 
not to recognize the guilt mo- 
tives behind the careful provi- 
sioning of this ship. And he was 
too good a divine not to see 
through the religious hokum to 
the essential rightness of his 
role on this project. 

There had to be a safety fuse. 

'T'he first crude attempts at 
mechanical reproduction of 
consciousness had been made on 
an island in Puget Sound. The 
island no longer existed. “ Rogue 
consciousness!” they had scream- 
ed. True enough. Something had 
defied natural laws, slaughtered 



lab personnel, destroyed sensors, 
sent slashing beams of pure de- 
struction through the surround- 
ing countryside. 

Finally, it had taken the island 
— God knew where. 

Poof! 

No island. 

No lab personnel. 

Nothing but gray water and a 
cold north wind whipping white- 
caps across it and the fish and 
the seaweed invading the area 
where land and men and ma- 
chinery had been. 

Just thinking about it made 
Flattery shiver. He conjured up 
in his mind the image of the sa- 
cred graphic from his quarters, 
absorbed some of the peace from 
the field of serenity, the tran- 
quility of the holy faces. 

Even Moonbase didn’t walk 
too close to this project now. It 
was all a sham to educate ship 
personnel, to frustrate the eager 
young men and women. 

“ Each project ship must main- 
tain its coefficient of frustra- 
tion” went the private ad- 
monition. “Frustration must 
come from both human and 
mechanical sources.” 

They thought of frustration 
as a threshhold, a factor to 
heighten awareness. 

It made a weird kind of sense. 

Thus, there were crew mem- 
bers like Flattery . and Pru- 
dence Weygand, and machinery 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



33 



that broke down, robox repair 
units that had to have a human 
monitor every second — and pro- 
grammed emergencies to com- 
plicate real emergencies. 

Flattery longed to get back to 
his quarters, to bathe himself in 
the field generator there, ex- 
amine the mood of the computer 
complex and be certain it had 
settled back to pure mechanism 
since deprived of its Organic 
Mental Cores. 

But he could not leave here 
yet, could not display any sus- 
picious behavior. 

CCTf you start rebuilding sys- 
•A terns,” Prudence was say- 
ing, “how long would it take to 
restore communications?” 

“Fifteen to twenty hours,” 
Bickel said. “We could have a 
jury rig in doing the job by 
then.” 

Flattery looked questioningly 
at Timberlake. 

“That’s about right,” Timber- 
lake agreed. 

“We use the AAT as a basis 
for our simulator,” Bickel said. 
“We’ll raid colony stores for 
reels of neuron fiber, Eng mul- 
tipliers and the other basic com- 
ponents. What we have to get is 
a system that simulates human 
nerve net function.” 

“But will it be conscious?” 
Flattery asked. 

“All we can do is cut and try,” 



Bickel said. “Our computer and 
even the AAT work on analogue 
additive principles. We’re going 
to build a system that’s strictly 
infinite-multiplying. Our sys- 
tem will produce message units 
that are products of many mul- 
tipliers.” 

“You make it sound so 
simple,” Prudence said. “Con- 
nect net A to net B at points D 
and D prime and you get the 
Consciousness Factor — CF for 
short.” 

Bickel’s lips thinned. “You 
have a better plan?” 

Did I push too hard? she won- 
dered. And she spoke quickly: 
“Oh, I’m with you, Bickel. You 
obviously know all the answers.” 

“I don’t know all the answers,” 
Bickel growled, “but I’m not go- 
ing to sit out here moaning about 
fate . and I’m not turning 
back.” 

What if we have to turn back? 
Flattery wondered. What do we 
do about Bickel’s inhibition 
then? 

“Are you going to wait for 
Moonbase to answer?” Flattery 
asked. 

Bickel glanced at Prudence. 
“I’d prefer starting at once, but 
that means I’d miss my shift on 
the board . and since I’ll need 
Tim . .” 

“We can handle it,” Flattery 
said. “Everything seems to be 
running smoothly.” 



34 



GALAXY 



Prudence looked up at the big 
board and the inactive repeaters 
over her couch, wondering at her 
sudden feeling of chill. I’m afraid 
to take that board, she thought. 

Those thousands of lives down 
in the hyb tanks ... all depend- 
ing on right-the-first-time reac- 
tions. Did the UMB bigdomes 
really know what they were do- 
ing when they sent us out here? 
Was this the only way? 

For the first time since coming 
out of the hyb tank, she felt the 
old familiar pain-of-wonder, 
asking herself what it might’ve 
been like to’ve been bom into a 
normal family in the normal 
way, to have grown up in the 
noisy, intimate belonging of the 
unchosen. 

“You are the cream, the select 
few,” Morgan Hempstead and 
his cohorts had kept reminding 
them. But she was one of the 
select few who knew where the 
cream had originated. Most of 
the medics on the ship knew. 
Normal biopsy tissue from a liv- 
ing human volunteer had been 
suspended in an axolotl tank, 
the genetic imprint triggered and 
the flesh allowed to grow. It pro- 
duced an identical twin — an ex- 
pendable twin. 

Select few! she thought. 
Something precious was taken 
from us and the compensations 
were inadequate. 

She tuned the small screen at 



the corner of her board to one of 
the tail eyes, looked back to- 
ward the center of the solar sys- 
tem, toward the planet that had 
spawned them. 

A stabbing pang of homesick- 
ness tightened her breast, made 
breathing difficult. 

They had been moulded and 
motivated, twisted, trained and 
inhibited — wound up like m ech- 
anical toys and sent scooting off 
into the darkness with their laser 
“whistle” tooting to let UMB 
know where they were. 

And where are we? she asked 
herself. 

“Prue, you’d better take the 
big board,” Flattery said. “You’d 
normally follow John.” 

Sight of the big board’s dials 
and gauges filled her with an 
abrupt anger and fear. She felt 
the immediacy of the emotions in 
a dry throat, heat in her cheeks. 

“I .. haven’t had enough 
time off the board ... to recu- 
perate,” Flattery said, speaking 
hesitantly. “Or I’d . .” 

“It’s all right,” she said. “I’ll 
take it.” 

V 

I n Corn-central, the sounds 
were those the umbilicus 
crew had come to accept as nor- 
mal — the crack of action couches 
in their gimbals, the click of an 
occasional relay as it called at-

tention to a telltale on the big 
board. 

“Has Bickel unburdened him- 
self at all about the artificial 
consciousness project at UMB?” 
Prudence asked. 

She removed her attention mo- 
mentarily from the master con- 
sole, glanced at Flattery, her 
sole companion on the lonely 
watch. Flattery appeared a bit 
pale, his mouth drawn down- 
ward in a frown. She returned 
her attention to the console, not- 
ing on the timelog that her ship- 
watch had a little more than an 
hour yet to run. The strain was 
beginning to drag at her energy 
reserves. Flattery was taking a 
hell of a long time to answer, 



she thought . but he was 
famous for the ponderous reply. 

“He’s said a little,” Flattery 
said, and he glanced at the 
hatch to the computer mainten- 
ance shop where Bickel and 
Timberlake were working. “Prue, 
shouldn’t we be listening in on 
them, making sure they . .” 
“Not yet,” she said. 

“They wouldn’t have to know 
we were listening.” 

“You underestimate Bickel,” 
she said. “That’s about the worst 
mistake you can make. He’s 
fully capable of throwing a trace 
meter onto the communications 
— as I have — just on the off 
chance something interesting'll 
turn up.” 



36 



GALAXY 



“D’you think he’s started . 
building?” 

“Mostly preparation at this 
stage,” she said. “They’re col- 
lecting material. You can pretty 
well follow their movements by 
watching the power drain here 
on the board, the shifts in tem- 
perature sensors and the dosim- 
eter repeaters and the drain on 
the robox cargo handlers.” 
“They’ve been out into the 
cargo sections?” 

“One of them has . prob- 
ably Tim.” 

“You know what Bickel said 
about the UMB attempt?” Flat- 
tery asked. He paused to scratch 
an itch under his chin. “Said the 
biggest failure was in attention 
— the experts wandering away, 
doing everything but keeping 
their attention on the main line.” 
“That’s a little too warm for 
comfort,” she said. 

“He may suspect,” Flattery 
said, “but he can’t be certain.” 
“There you go underestimat- 
ing him again,” she said. 

“Well, at least he’s going to 
need our help,” Flattery said, 
“and we’ll be able to tell what’s 
going on from how he needs us.” 
“Are you sure he needs us?” 
“He’ll have to use you for his 
deeper math analysis,” Flattery 
said. “And me . well, he’s go- 
ing to be plowing through the 
von Neuman problem before he 
gets much beyond the first steps. 



He may not’ve faced that yet, 
but he’ll have to when he real- 
izes he has to get deterministic 
results from unreliable hard- 
ware.” 

Qhe turned to stare at him, not- 
^ ing the far away look in his 
eyes. “How’s that again?” 

“He has to build with non-liv- 
ing matter.” 

“So what?” She returned her 
attention to the board. “Nature 
makes do with the same stuff. 
Living systems aren’t living be- 
low the molecular level.” 

“And you underestimate . 
life,” Flattery said. “The basic 
elements Bickel has to use are 
from our robot stores — reels of 
quasi -biological neurons and 

solid-state devices, nerex wire 
and things like that — all of it 
non-living at a stage far above 
the molecular.” 

“But their fine structure’s as 
relevant to their function as any 
living matter’s is.” 

“Perhaps you’re beginning to 
see the essential hubris in even 
approaching this problem.” 

“Oh, come off that, Chaplain,” 
she said. “We’re not back in the 
Eighteenth Century making 
Vaucanson’s wonderful duck.” 
“We’re tackling something 
much more complex than prim- 
itive automata,” he agreed, “but 
our intention’s the same as 
Vaucanson’s.” 



V7 



“That’s absolutely not true,” 
she said. “If we succeed and 
took our machine back to Vau- 
canson’s time and showed it to 
him, he’d just marvel at our 
mechanical ability.” 

“You miss the mark,” Flat- 
tery said. “Poor Vaucanson 
would run for the nearest priest 
and volunteer for the lynch mob 
to do away with us. You see, he 
never intended to make anything 
that was really alive.” 

“It’s only a matter of degree, 
not basic difference.” 

“He was like Aladdin rubbing 
the lamp compared to us,” Flat- 
tery said. “And even if his inten- 
tions were the same as ours, he 
wasn’t aware of it.” 

“You’re talking in circles,” she 
said. 

“Am I, really? This is the thing 
that writers and philosophers 
have skirted for centuries with 
their eyes half averted. This is 
the monster out of folklore, Prue. 
This is Frankenstein’s poor zom- 
bie and the Sorcerer’s Appren- 
tice. The very idea of building a 
conscious robot can be faced only 
if we recognize the implicit dan- 
ger — that we may be building 
a Golem that’ll destroy us.” 

“Oh, for God’s sake, Raj!” 
Prudence said. “Have you com- 
pletely forgotten that you’re a 
scientist?” 

“For God’s sake, I can never 
forget it,” he said. 

38 



He glared at her. His throat 
felt dry and burning. 

“You’re supposed to be doing 
this to me, aren’t you,” he ac- 
cused. “You’re supposed to push 
me and test me, give me no 
peace. I know.” 

How little he knows ... or 
even suspects, she thought. 

Flattery stared at the curved 
gray metal of the bulkhead above 
him, seeing the tiny imperfec- 
tions in the crackle pattern of its 
finish. He felt he was being man- 
euvered. She was stalking him 
the way a man might stalk game. 
Was it his soul she was after? 
He sensed he was in profound 
danger, that the idea of con- 
sciousness as something they 
could create might inflict itself 
on his soul as an incurable 
wound. 

He put a hand to his mouth. 
I cannot permit her to bait m« 
and tempt me. 

“Raj,” she whispered and there 
was terror in her voice. 

Tie whirled toward her, seeing 
1 the streaks of light across 
the big board like red knife 
slashes. 

“We’re almost at red-line tem- 
perature in Sector C-8 of the hyb 
tanks,” she said. “Everything I 
do seems to make the system 
oscillate.” 

Flattery’s hands flashed out 
to the life systems repeater 



GALAXY 



switches, brought his own moni- 
tors alive. He scanned the in- 
struments, said: “Call Tim.” 

“Nothing I do seems to work!” 
she panted. 

He glanced at her, saw she 
was fighting the board, not work- 
ing with it. 

“Call Tim!” he barked. 

She hit the command circuit 
switch with the heel of her left 
hand, shouted: “Tim to Corn- 
central! Emergency!” 

Again, Flattery scanned his in- 
struments. There appeared to be 
three points of temperature shift 
outside the hyb tanks with cor- 
responding variation inside. As 
Prue tried to compensate for one 
fluctuation, the others fell far- 
ther toward the red. 

He had to force himself to 
keep his hands off the controls. 
If tank temperature went into 
the red without dehyb precau- 
tions, there’d be deaths among 
the helpless occupants. Despite 
Prue’s desperate efforts, death 
was approaching three sectors of 
the C-8 tank — some four hun- 
dred human lives in there. 

The hatch from the computer 
shop banged open. Timberlake 
leaped through with Bickel right 
behind. 

“Hyb tanks,” Prudence gasp- 
ed. “Temperature.” 

Timberlake threw himself 
across Com-central into his action 
couch. His vacsuit rasped against 



the cocoon lips as he turned, 
grasped the traveler controls. 
“Give me the red switch,” he 
snapped. “To hell with the count! 
I’m taking it.” 

And he took it, the big board 
swinging across much too fast. 

“C-8,” she said, sinking back 
and wiping perspiration from her 
forehead. 

“I’ve got it,” he said. He scan- 
ned the dials and gauges, his 
fingers playing over the console. 

Bickel slipped into his own 
couch, tripped his repeaters. “It’s 
in the hull shielding,” he said. 

“First two layers,” Timberlake 
said. 

Prudence put a hand to her 
throat, tried not to look at Bickel. 
He mustn’t suspect our atten- 
tion’s on him, she thought. Then: 
Wouldn’t it be monstrous irony 
to lose our colonists and burden 
ourselves with guilt before the 
need tor it? 

“That’s doing it,” Bickel said. 

She looked across to the board 
above Timberlake, saw the warn 
mg telltales winking out, the 
dials swinging back into norma' 
range. 

“Faulty feedback for a patch 
of our shell reflectors focused on 
C-8,” Timberlake said. “The sys- 
tem started to oscillate and that 
threw the overload switches, left 
us wide open.” 

“Another design failure,” Bick- 
el sneered. 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



39 



And such a simple problem, 
Bickel thought. The hull curve 
acted like a lens to focus energy 
within the ship . unless reflec- 
tor and shell shielding systems 
compensated. 

Prudence traced the line of the 
remaining telltales, said: “C-8’s 
on a line with that robot stores 
section you were raiding. Is that 
all it takes to throw the ship off 
balance?” 

“Gives you a wonderful feeling 
of confidence in the Tin Egg’s 
design, doesn’t it,” Bickel said. 

They didn’t warn me! she 
thought. They cheated. Calculat- 
ed emergencies, they said, just 
enough to keep a fine edge on 
your reaction abilities. Reaction 
abilities! 

ttX^ou overcompensated, 
Prue,” Timberlake said. 
“Make minimal adjustments to 
avoid oscillation while you hunt 
for the source of your trouble. 
You had sensor telltales flaring 
right out through the ship to pin- 
point where you needed shielding 
reinforcement.” 

I panicked, she thought. And 
she said : “I guess I let myself get 
too tired.” Even as she spoke she 
sensed how lame the excuse 
sounded. 

I was too intent doing the job 
on Flattery, she thought. I had 
him headed for a nice corner 
where he’d have to fight his way 



out . and 1 missea rne snip 
trouble until it was almost ready 
to wreck us. 

It occurred to her then to won- 
der if one of the crew had her as 
a “special project” to keep her 
abilities toned up ... on edge. 

“Prue, you’ve got to remember 
that when the overload switches 
go the computer automatics are 
out of the circuit,” Bickel said. 
“This thing was designed to be 
brought back into line by a con- 
scious intelligence — one of us 
or an OMC.” 

“Oh, shut up!” she flared. “I 
made a mistake. I know it. I 
won’t do it again.” 

“No damage was done,” Tim- 
berlake said. 

“I don’t need you to defend 
me!” she snapped. 

“That’s enough of that!” Bickel 
snapped, turning to glare at Pru- 
dence. “We’d better clear a little 
air, here. We’re on our own, Prue. 
You’ve no idea how much on our 
own we are. We have to depend 
on each other because we sure as 
hell can’t depend on the Tin Egg! 
We can’t afford to snap and bite 
at each other.” 

Oh, can’t we now, she thought. 

“We’re trapped on a ship that 
contains only one top drawer 
mechanism,” Bickel said. “We’ve 
only one thing that functions 
smoothly and beautifully the way 
it should — our computer. Every- 
thing else works as though it’d 



40 



GALAXY 



been designed and built by six 
left-handed apes.” 

“Bickel thinks it was all delib- 
erate,” Timberlake said. 

Prudence caught herself in an 
involuntary glance at Flattery, 
forced her attention away from 
Bickel and onto Timberlake. This 
is far too early for Bickel to sus- 
pect, she thought. 

Timberlake avoided her eyes. 
Pie looked like a small boy who’d 
been caught stealing jam. 

Flattery broke the silence. “De- 
liberate?” he asked. 

“Yeah,” Timberlake said. “He 
thinks the other six ships had the 
same kind of failure — something 
rotten with the OMCs.” 

Bicker s far more alert and sus- 
picious than anyone suspected. 
Prudence thought. Raj or I will 
have to side with him; there’s no 
other way to keep control of the 
situation. 

“Why ... the OMCs?” Flat- 
tery asked. 

“Let’s not tip toe around it,” 
Bickel said. “The thing’s obvious. 
What feature of these ships is 
never mentioned in the stress 
analyses trying to find a cause 
for the six previous failures? 
What feature do we assume is 
proof against failure because 
there’s no hint of one breaking 
down?” 

“Surely not the OMCs,” Flat- 
tery said. He tried to hold his 
voice to a bantering level, failed 



and thought: God help us. nick- 
el’s seen through the sham far 
too soon. 

“Certainly the OMCs ” Bickel 
said. “And they gave us three of 
the damn’ things! One in service 
and two for back up. Never a 
hint that an OMC could fail, yet 
we had three on the Tin Egg!” 

“Why?” Prudence asked. 

“To make damn’ sure we got 
beyond the point of no return be- 
fore we got the cold-turkey 
treatment,” Bickel said. 

I guess I’m elected. Prudence 
thought. She said: “More of Proj- 
ect’s goddamn' maneuvering! 
Sure. It’d be right in character.” 

Flattery shot a startled look 
at her, returned his attention to 
the big board before Bickel no- 
ticed. 

“Cold turkey,” Bickel said. 
“This ship’s one elaborate simu- 
lation device with a single pur- 
pose — and my guess is the 
others were the same. 

“Can’t you see it?” Bickel ask- 
ed. “Don’t you recognize the pur- 
pose? It casts its shadow over 
everything around us. It’s the 
only thing that makes any sense 
out of this charade. The secrecy, 
the mystery, the maneuvering — 
everything’s calculated to put us 
on a greased slide into a very 
special ocean. It’s not just cold 
turkey, it’s sink or swim. And the 
only way we can swim is to de- 
velop an artificial consciousness.”

S he wrote her name: “Prudence 
Weygand” at the foot of the 
log tape, started it rolling through 
the auto-recorder, made the syn- 
chronous shift to Flattery’s tape 
as he took over the board. The 
counter said it was her fifteenth 
change of shift. 

Flattery squirmed in his 
couch, settling himself for the 
four hour watch. Reflections on 
the dial faces were hypnotic. He 
shook his head to bring himself 
to full alertness, heard the hiss 
of fabric as Prudence got out of 
her couch. She stood there a mo- 
ment stretching, did a dozen deep 
knee bends. 

How easily they accept the 
possibility that I’m the execution 
er, Flattery thought. He noted 
how wide awake and alert Pru- 
dence appeared. This four hours 
on-four hours off routine could 
be endured as long as no serious 
problems arose, but it played hob 
with the metabolic cycle. Pru- 
dence should be headed for food 
and rest, but she obviously was 
wide awake. 

She glanced at Flattery, saw 
he ■was settled in for the watch, 
checked the repair log. Nothing 
was flagged urgent. That made it 
a bit more than twenty-five hours 
with nothing more than minor 
adjustments on the big board. 
Smooth. Too smooth. 



Danger keeps you honed to a 
fine edge, she thought. Extended 
peace makes you dull. 

“You’d better get something to 
eat and try to rest,” Flattery 
said. 

“I’m not hungry.” 

“At least try to rest.” 

“Maybe later. Think I’ll wan- 
der in and see how Bickel and 
Tim’re doing.” She looked at the 
big screen overhead. It was tuned 
to the peak- corner lenses of the 
computer shop. And for all the 
four hours of her shift it had been 
producing provocative sights and 
sounds. 

Bickel and Timberlake had 
been busy. She took one low-grav 
step across to the hatch-lock, let 
herself through and stopped to 
study what they had accomp- 
lished. 

Timberlake was nowhere in 
sight. And where the optical 
character reader had been on the 
big panel across from the lock 
now stretched a mechanical ex- 
crescence — a piled and jutting 
structure of plastic blocks; Eng 
multiplier circuits, each sealed 
in plastic insulator. Linking the 
blocks were loops and tangles 
and twists of insulated pseudo- 
neuron fiber. 

Bickel had heard her entrance. 
Without turning from his work 
at one end of that protruding 
angular construction, he said: 
“Take that other micro-tie view- 



42 



GALAXY 



er on the bench. I need 21.006 
centimeters of the K-Ar neuro- 
fiber with random-spaced end- 
bulbs and multisynapses. Con- 
nect it as I’ve indicated on that 
schematic labeled G-20. It should 
be the top one in that pile on the 
right end of the bench.” 

Bickel sat down on the deck, 
slid a new block of Eng multi- 
pliers into position. He swung a 
portable micro-tie viewer across 
the block, leaned into the view- 
er’s forehead rests, began making 
the connections. 

Fes, sir! she thought. 

“\A/ re ’ re almost ready to put 
’ * this on an initial pro- 
gram,” Bickel said when she had 
finished the assembly. He began 
connecting it to the newly in- 
stalled Eng multiplier block, run- 
ning one sheaf back to a plug- 
board connection on the compu- 
ter panel. 

Prudence stepped back, studied 
the mechanical growth that jut- 
ted from the wall. As though she 
taw it for the first time, the con- 
struction abruptly took on a new 
meaning for her. 

“That’s more than a set-up for 
analysis,” she said. 

“That’s right, doll.” 

Bickel stood up, wiped his 
hands on the sides of his vacsuit, 
swung his own micro-manipula- 
tor and viewer to one side. 

“This,” Bickel said, “in addi- 



tion to giving us our analysis of 
built-in misfunction, this little 
‘Ox’ we’re driving will provide a 
three-way energy interchange.” 

“You’re tied into the compu- 
ter,” she accused, pointing to the 
connections to the plugboard. 

“Every line in that board has 
a diode in it,” Bickel said. “Pulses 
can come from the computer to 
our test set-up, but anything go- 
ing into the computer has to be 
coded by one of us and inserted 
over there.” He pointed to the 
input heads lined up at the right 
corner of the wall. 

Prue turned to look at the over- 
head screen where Flattery was 
revealed calmly monitoring the 
big board. Something he had 
said came back to her full force: 

“There’s nothing concerning 
ourselves about which we can be 
truly objective except our physi 
cal responses, the reflections of 
behavior. We exist in a forest of 
illusion where the very concept 
of consciousness merges with il- 
lusion.” 

And Prudence thought: To be 
conscious, you must surmount 
illusion. Bickel saw that where 1 
didn’t. 

She asked herself now how this 
applied to her own personal at 
tack on their problem. The living 
chemistry of the body held clues 
to consciousness that had never 
been adequately explored. Neuro- 
regulatory shifts in biochemistry

triggered by consciousness ex- 
panders and hallucinogens had 
beckoned to experimenters be- 
fore, but never in a situation par- 
alleling a mechanical attack on 
the problem. 

That avenue had to be ex- 
plored, she knew — but she had 
only one guinea pig: herself. And 
tests on her own body with 
serotonin and adrenalin fractions 
were dangerous. She couldn’t 
avoid the suspicion she might be 
giving in to a death wish. 

Now, she wondered: Am I de- 
luding myself? Is this more illu- 
sion? Or is it just an excuse not 
to keep up the anti-S dosage so 
I’ll become sexually desirable to 
Bickel? 

tt r_ r'hat’s it,” Bickel said. “Let’s 
give it a run. Prue, moni- 
tor the diagnostic board.” He 
gestured to the panel of dials and 
gauges at the left of the plug- 
board. “I’ll give each net poten- 
tial of the roulette cycles a one- 
fifth second burst from the shot 
generator.” He moved around to 
the right of the test set-up, flip- 
ped switches to start the source 
program through the inputs. 

“Mark,” he said. 

“Mark,” she said as her dials 
registered the pulse. 

“Give me the mean synapse 
threshhold, mean endbulb thresh- 
hold and action time on each 
net,” Bickel said. He depressed 



three switches simultaneously. 
“Interchange activated.” 

He waited, feeling the suspense 
grow as a tightness in his stom- 
ach. 

“Interchange now showing Mi- 
trance pulse,” she said. 

“Net one,” he said, introduc- 
ing the timed burst from the shot 
generator. 

“There’s a jam-up at the fifth- 
layer nodes,” she said. “No im- 
pulses are getting through.” 

“I’ll try sweeping the roulette 
cycles,” Bickel said. He twisted 
a dial. 

“Nothing,” she said. “Still that 
fifth-layer jam-up.” 

Bickel stepped back, glared at 
the input panel. “This is nuts! 
What we have here is essentially 
a transducer. The outputs should 
match!” 

Again, Prudence read her dials. 
“Your products are still zero,” 
she said. 

“Any heat?” Bickel asked. 

“Nothing significant,” she said. 

“Somehow, we’ve produced a 
unitary orthogonal system for 
each net and the total assembly,” 
Bickel said. “And that’s a contra- 
diction. It could mean we have 
more than one system in each of 
these separate nets.” 

“You have an unknown that’s 
swallowing energy,” Prudence 
said, her excitement kindling. 
“Isn’t that our definition of . .” 

“It isn’t conscious,” Bickel 



44 



GALAXY 



said. “Whatever the unknown 
system is, it can’t be conscious 
. not yet. This set-up is too 
simple, doesn’t have enough 
source data. .” 

“Then it’s some error in the 
hook-up,” Prudence said. 

Bickel’s shoulders sagged. He 
took a deep, tired breath. “Yeah. 
Has to be.” 

“Where’s your record of as- 
sembly and circuit tests?” Pru- 
dence asked. 

“I isolated an auxiliary storage 
tank,” Bickel said. He gestured 
vaguely to his left. “It’s the red- 
flagged one. Everything’s in there 
. including all this.” He waved 
at the diagnostic panel. 

“You get something to eat and 
take a rest-break,” she said. “I’ll 
start tracing circuits.” 

“We got a jam-up on the direct 
test,” Bickel said. “It wasn’t an 
open-circuit reaction. And the 
net-interchange test produces 
zero at the output without flag- 
ging the point of loss. The thing’s 
a goddamn’ sponge!” 

"It’ll be some simple error,” 
she said. 

Timberlake’s head suddenly 
appeared from the hatch that led 
to the circuitry in the ’tween- 
decks crawl space. “It’s down 
here,” he said. ‘With the primary 
sheafs. Don’t do anything for a 
minute.” 

He disappeared again. Mean- 
while Prudence was scanning the 



print-out. With a sense of awe 
she realized that it was devoid 
of insignificant digits. 

It had been weeded down to 
essentials. 

( t'\7'oh!” Timberlake called, his 
* voice echoing with a hol- 
low resonance from the crawl 
space. 

Bickel looked down, saw that 
only Timberlake’s feet protruded 
into the shop now. 

“Found it,” Timberlake said. 
“It’s a fifty-line sheaf, single 
plug. Shall I pull it?” 

‘Where does it lead?” Bickel 
asked. 

“According to the color code 
it leads right down into the ac- 
cessory storage banks,” Timber- 
lake said. Timberlake’s feet dis- 
appeared into the crawl space. 
“All these banks are linked that 
way! Why the hell doesn’t it ap- 
pear on the schematics?” 

Bickel got down on his hands 
and knees at the mouth of the 
crawl hole, said: “Is there any 
kind of buffer or gating system 
in those lines?” 

A hand light wavered back and 
forth in the crawl space. “Yeah, 
by god!” Timberlake said. 
“How’d you know?” 

“Had to be,” Bickel said. “This 
is a computer fail-safe device. 
Don’t mess with it.” 

Bickel rocked back on his heels, 
fighting a lost, sinking sensation. 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM?

Those bastards! he thought. 
They knew we’d find this the 
first time we went looking into 
the computer’s innards. They’ve 
tied our hands. 

“Come on out, Tim,” Bickel 
said. “Don’t change a damn’ 
thing.” He stood up, removed the 
blocking plugs he had inserted 
to isolate this storage bank. 

Isolate! he thought. Hah! 

All he’d done was change the 
potential at one point and insure 
that he wouldn’t have the ad- 
dresses on any of the test in- 
formation they’d just sent into 
the system. 

Timber lake scooted backward 
out of the crawl space, stood up. 
“Does that make sense to you?” 
he asked, gesturing toward the 

hole. 

“I wish it didn’t,” Bickel said. 
“This computer has what 
amounts to a random address 
system as far as we’re concerned. 
There’ll be enormous blocks of 
information filed in it bit by bit 
in such a way that only the com- 
puter knows where it is. That’s 
why we have so many special 
function routines and subrou- 
tines and sub-subroutines ad in- 
finitum. The addresses of those 
we know.” 

“The organic cores must’ve 
known where the information 
was,” Prudence said. 

“And they’re dead,” Bickel 
said. 

46 



TV /T organ Hempstead’s burst-de- 
personalized voice filled the 
control room as Bickel started 
the playback of the new message 
from Moonbase. 

“Calling UMB ship Earthling. 
This is Project calling UMB ship 
Earthling.’’ 

A long, rolling silence followed 
and they grew aware of the hiss- 
ing of the tape as it sped across 
its sorting heads. 

Bickel glanced around the 
room — Flattery at the big board 
yet, composed and so serenely 
sure of himself; Prudence in her 
action couch and with her eyes 
intent on the vocal translator at 
the AAT ; Timberlake in his 
couch, eyes closed, breathing 
deeply. One might almost think 
he was asleep, but for the pulse 
at his temple. Bickel recognized 
that mannerism of Timberlake’s. 
It meant the man was chewing 
over a heavy problem. 

“Hit it,” Hempstead said. 

“That must be an error,” Bic- 
kel said. “The AAT goofed on 
that one.” 

“We do worse ourselves some- 
times,” Flattery said. 

“On the question of defining 
consciousness,” Hempstead said. 
“Reference is made to nerve bar- 
rier and threshhold data your 
computer. Best dive to date.” 

“Best definition to date,” Flat- 



GALAXY 



tery said. “That’s what he must 
have said.” 

“New Organic Mental Core,” 
Hempstead said. “Medical per- 
sonnel are directed to abandon 
all such repeats in their waste of 
order.” 

“There’s something wrong with 
the AAT,” Prudence said. 

“Not with the AAT,” Bickel 
said. “With the translator cir- 
cuits from the computer.” 

“That goddamn’ wild program 
we flushed through the system 
like a high colonic,” Timberlake 
growled. He opened his eyes, 
stared accusingly at Bickel. 

“Abandon all such attempts,” 
Hempstead said. “Repeat: aban- 
don all such attempts. This is a 
direct order.” 

“That sounds like him rightly 
enough,” Prudence said. 

“Under no circumstances are 
you to attempt to make in- 
animate components,” Hemp- 
stead said. 

“Try that one on your violin,” 
Timberlake said. 

“Analyze course and reaction 
data related to mass changes,” 
Hempstead said. “Unknown area 
derived mathematically.” 

“Hash!” Timberlake snarled. 
“Garbage!” 

“Project over and out,” Hemp- 
stead said. “Acknowledge year 
compliance.” 

Timberlake sat up, swung his 
feet to the deck. “Go ahead, 



Bick,” he said. “Acknowledge 
year compliance.” 

Flattery glanced at Timber- 
lake, returned his attention to the 
board. Timberlake obviously was 
making a bid to regain his au- 
thority. That could’ve been pre- 
dicted. Their first setback would 
bring him charging out — from 
fear for all those lives dependent 
on the life systems if not for any 
other reason. Flattery had watch- 
ed the way Timberlake studied 
the life systems repeaters. Noth- 
ing wrong there . yet. But a 
threat to any part of the ship was 
a threat to all. 

“Was he asking us to install a 
new brain?” Prudence asked. 

“Where could we get one?” 
Timberlake asked. 

“We’ve already been through 
that,” she said, looking at each 
of them in turn. 

And for the first time since 
taking her position with the um- 
bilicus crew, Prudence allowed 
herself to wonder what it really 
would be like to become that 
fleshless embodiment, the men- 
tality-central to a driving be- 
hemoth such as this ship. 

She shivered. 

They taunt me with blasphemy , 
Flattery thought. 

“Are you cold, Prudence?” he 
asked. 

He watches me all the time, she 
thought. The medical part of her 
faced the feminine part then, 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



47 



wondering if Flattery knew how 
she was twisting her body chemis- 
try. 

“I’m quite comfortable,” she 
said. 

But she wasn’t comfortable. 
Moods of depression and elation 
shot through her without warning 
and had to be concealed. Strange 
psychic aches tortured her mind 
— fantasies of god-like power 
competed with the urge of physi- 
cal abasement. 

Bickel turned from the AAT 
with a length of printer tape, 
said: “Garbage.” 

“What else?” Timberlake 
snapped. 

Flattery started to speak, froze 
in the act while he studied the 
track graph on his board. He 
hadn’t imagined it; the graph 
was climbing. “We’ve been gain- 
ing speed for several minutes,” he 
said. “Slow . but steady.” 

( t ]T\rive problems now!” Tim- 
berlake snarled. 

Flattery activated the drive 
read-out, scanned it. “No,” he 
said. “No emission. G/R level 
shows the normal radiation 
drop.” 

“Mass register?” Bickel asked. 

Flattery’s hands flicked over 
the keyboard. He scanned his 
gauges. “Out of register! Mass 
reference is out of register!” 

“What are your readings?” 
Bickel asked. 

48 



“They vary through ten argos," 
Flattery muttered. “They don’t 
graph back ... no series-constant 
in the curve of change — Fourier 
or otherwise. Mass is out of regis- 
ter with speed.” 

“What’d Hempstead say?” 
Bickel demanded, looking back 
at the print- out tape. He quoted; 
“ ‘Analyze course and reaction 
data related to mass changes.’ If 
he . .” 

“That could be garbage!” Tim- 
berlake snapped. 

“Still that gradual speed in- 
crease,” Flattery said. “A slow 
increment for about four minutes 
now.” 

The ship is programmed tot 
emergencies, Prudence thought. 
That’s what they said. But which 
are emergencies from that pro- 
gram . and which are emer- 
gencies from . the unknown? 

Flattery took a comparator 
read-out, said: “In the past min- 
ute and eight seconds, our speed 
has gone up .011002 against the 
fixed reference.” 

Bickel began shifting plugs on 
his computer board. His fingers 
danced over the keys. He checked 
the telltales, looked to the visual 
read-out screen. “It gives us 
wind-and-molecule analogy,” he 
said. “If the range of individual 
molecular mass within a moving 
gas is less than that of an object 
in the path of the gas, the chance 
erf collision between gas molecules 



GALAXY 



and the object follows a probabi- 
listic curve related to the mean 
difference in mass.” 

Timberlake coughed, said: “Is 
that thing saying our speed has 
raised our mass to a point where 
something is . colliding with us? 
That’s nuts! We’re being pushed, 
according to the track graph. 
What about things we hit, things 
in out path?” 

“Maybe it’s all going our way 
in this sector of space,” Bickel 
said. “We don’t know.” 

C C T)repare for retro-firing,” 
Flattery said. 

“Wouldn’t it be wiser to turn 
ship?” Timberlake asked. He 
kicked the manual cocoon switch 
and the action couch snapped se- 
curely around him. 

“Raj’s right,” Bickel said. “Use 
minimum change. Something’s 
happening for which we have no 
base of experience.” 

“I am starting retro with micro- 
emission,” Flattery said. “Prue, 
monitor the track graph. Tim, 
watch our mass reference. I am 
recording for later analysis.” 

“If there is a later,” Timber- 
lake muttered. 

Flattery ignored him, said: 
“John, monitor hull temperature 
and doppler comparison.” 

“Right.” Bickel cleared his 
throat, thinking how crude was 
this quartered division of func- 
tions when compared with a 



properly working ship-control 
robobrain. The umbilicus crew 
was a pack of limping cripples by 
comparison . and in a situa- 
tion where they needed to run 
and dodge and balance with the 
ability of an athlete. 

“Starting retro,” Flattery said 
evenly. 

He moved the micro-controls 
one notch. 

Action couches made a slight 
adjustment to the change. It reg- 
istered as a creeping movement 
of their repeater consoles against 
the conduits, pipes and instru- 
ments of the fixed walls. 

“Track graph report,” Flattery 
said. 

“Speed is dropping unevenly,” 
Prudence said. “Fits and jerks.” 

Bickel, watching the edge of his 
repeater where it aligned with the 
edge of a wall plate, could see 
the bucking movement of the ship 
as a series of tiny jerks. His hands 
on the console keys sensed a 
tremor in the ship. 

“Tell me when the graph lev- 
els off,” Flattery said. “Mass 
reference report.” 

“Uneven,” Timberlake said. 
“Graph average is dropping, but 
the direct register is going up and 
down . it’s .008, .0095 . 
.0069 . .” 

“Let me know if it levels,” Flat- 
tery said. 

Without being asked, Bickel 
said: “There’s a micro -increase 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



49 



in temperature along the first 
quadrant, stern. Compensation 
system is taking care of it ade- 
quately. Doppler reference shows 
an actual speed decrease of .00904 
plus.” 

“Mark,” Flattery said. 

“S over C confirms,” Prudence 
said. 

Flattery advanced the micro- 
control another notch, feeling 
perspiration along his back and 
neck collecting too fast for his 
suit to compensate. 

“Track,” he said. 

“Graph is now dipping below 
the fixed reference,” Prudence 
said. “Still dropping unevenly.” 

“Ion reading,” Flattery said. 

“One over four point two eight 
double ought one,” Timberlake 
said. “Agreement with emission 
rate is positive. Retro normal.” 

“Rate of down-graph is now 
even on the track,” Prudence 
said. 

“Mass reference level and 
.000001001 out of agreement,” 
Timberlake said. 

“Hull temperature?” Flattery 
said. 

“Holding,” Bickel said, and al- 
lowed himself a deep breath. 
Changes in hull temperature 
where they should not occur, 
changes in their speed without 
a positive explanation — these 
were more alarming than a phys- 
ical breakdown that they could 
touch with their hands. 



F lattery heard the sigh and 
thought: The Tin Egg had a 
close call. But close to what? 
Does Bickel know? Did he tell 
us everything he got from the 
computer? Even so, how can we 
trust computer information now? 

But Flattery recalled another 
part of Hempstead’s possibly- 
garbled message: ‘Unknown area 
derived mathematically.' 

What if that were pretty close 
to Hempstead’s actual words? 
Flattery asked himself. An un- 
known of some kind derived 
mathematically. The ship had en- 
countered a mass/speed problem. 

Bickel said: “Raj, drop the 
speed another two points and 
hold. We’ll want regular checks 
on mass/speed variations from 
here on out.” 

“Complying,” Flattery said. 
“Report in order.” He turned to 
the micro- controls, dropped them 
two more notches. 

“Track graph declines on an 
even slope,” Prudence said. 

“Mass reference agrees,” Tim- 
berlake said. “Ion emission nor- 
mal.” 

“Temperature holding normal,” 
Bickel said. “Doppler compari- 
son is positive -zero.” 

Bickel looked at those two thin 
black needles of the doppler com- 
parator. They were what put the 
bite in this emergency. They pro- 
vided positive checks on speed 
through doppler reference to 



50 



GALAXY 



fixed astronomical bodies. The 
doppler comparison and change 
in speed had agreed one-for-one. 

“I do not understand what hap- 
pened,” Flattery said, “but I have 
the distinct feeling we were close 
to the brink.” 

“The brink of what?” Prudence 
demanded. Fear was plain in her 
voice. 

“We were close to running wild 
out of the solar system,” Bickel 
said. “Out of control, unable to 
maneuver. Quite likely, we were 
close to being hurtled into an- 
other dimension.” 

“Without a prayer of escape,” 
Timberlake said. 

“The negative transformations 
in grav theory,” Prudence whis- 
pered. 

“What?” Timberlake barked. 

“The implicit energy exchange 
for enormous mass shifts near the 
speed of light,” Prudence said. 
“The negative forms in the equa- 
tions don’t all cancel out until 
you build hypothetical transfor- 
mations beyond the speed of 
light. There is a region of mass/ 
speed change wherein two bodies 
theoretically repel each other 
rather than attract.” 

“Now,” Bickel said, “how do 
we tell Hempstead and his boys 
about this without blowing the 
whole show?” 

“We’ve already blown the 
whole show,” Timberlake growl- 
ed. “The computer . 



“Isn’t necessarily wrecked,” 
Bickel said. “Our life systems still 
work. Ship servos and sensors ap- 
pear to be in order. I get consist- 
ent replies and demands for in- 
formation.” 

“Consistent doesn’t mean cor- 
rect,” Timberlake said. 

“Was Hempstead telling us to 
cease and desist?” Flattery asked. 
“If he was . .” 

“We don’t know,” Bickel said. 
“As long as we don’t know, we 
don’t have to obey.” 

Or disobey, Flattery thought. 
He said: “How is it the comput- 
er seems to function on informa- 
tion demand, but not for AAT 
translation?” 

“That could mean only one 
band to debug,” Prudence said. 
“If it does . .” She broke off, 
staring at Bickel, who suddenly 
seemed in agony. 

Bickel had his eyes closed. Per- 
spiration beaded his forehead. 
The circuitry was as clear in his 
mind as though projected there 
from outside himself. He had 
never completely disconnected 
the Ox from the AAT system 
which they had used for the Ox’s 
interpretive routines. 

An empty sensation expanded 
through his chest as he realized 
every signal from outside into 
the AAT had gone through the 
Ox into the computer — there to 
be lost, there to mix up the AAT 
translator loops. 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



51 



tt'\7'ou didn’t disconnect the 
plugboard from the Ox,” 
Timberlake whispered. 

“But my computer read-out 
comes through my AAT board,” 
Bickel said. He could hear the 
desperation in his own voice. 
“Every program demand I put on 
the computer went through those 
same Ox circuits!” 

“You were using sub-routines 
with known addresses,” Prudence 
said. 

“Now everything you asked for 
has been scattered through the 
entire system and lost,” Timber- 
lake said. 

“Has it?” Bickel asked. He 
opened his eyes. There was only 
one logical way to be certain, of 
course. It wouldn’t do any more 
damage than already had been 
done ... if there was damage. 

We didn’t think of his cutting 
his off from UMB this way. 
Flattery thought. Destroying the 
translator loops! 

Without the translator system 
to decode the multi-repetitive 
laser-burst messages, the umbili- 
cus crew might just as well use 
hand signals for its messages to 
and from Moonbase. 

Carefully, because he had to 
be certain the first time, Bickel 
switched five patches in his AAT 
board, triple checked them. 

“What’re you doing?” Timber- 
lake demanded. 

“Be quiet,” Prudence said, as 



she recognized what Bickel in- 
tended. 

“But he’s already . .” 

“A diagnostic routine,” Bickel 
said. “We’ll use a simulsynchron- 
us B-register search with a repeat 
on our original test of the Ox 
circuitry. If harm has already 
been done, this will just go right 
through the same channels. It 
can’t do any more harm.” 

“And the B-register search 
could tell us where our data 
went,” Timberlake said. “Yeah.” 

“Are you sure?” Flattery asked. 

“The technique is right,” Pru- 
dence said. 

Working quietly, triple check- 
ing, Bickel patched together the 
necessary program. He took a 
deep breath, sent the first ele- 
ments of the diagnostic routine 
through the inputs, setting the 
balance of the test for off-line 
operation. He had to keep a con- 
stant check on this. 

Presently, he began to get DDA 
output, put it on conditional 
transfer with print-out at each 
step in the control sequence. 

Tie felt breathing at his shoul- 
1 A der, looked up to see that 
Prudence had abandoned her ac- 
tion couch, knelt beside him to 
stare up at the read-out. 

“The data’s been shifted, not 
lost,” she whispered. 

“That’s how it looks,” Bickel 
said. 



52 



GALAXY 




“It might as well be lost!” 
Timberlake barked. 

“No,” Bickel said. “The com- 
puter’s fully operative as long as 
we route everything through the 
Ox.” 

“Why didn’t the AAT work?” 
Timberlake demanded. 

“Come off that, Tim,” Bickel 
said. “You helped me build that 
test set-up.” 

“The incoming messages were 
going through the AAT circuits 
twice,” Timberlake said. “Sure.” 

“The bits cancelled themselves 
out all along the line,” Bickel 
said. “We probably didn’t get a 
fifth of the message.” 

“It did seem short,” Prudence 
said. 



“That message is the only thing 
we’ve really lost,” Bickel said. 
“I’ll ask for a repeat on . , 
“Wait!” Flattery said. 

“Yes?” Bickel looked at him. 
“What do you tell UMB hap- 
pened to the original message?” 
Flattery asked. He glanced away 
from Corn-central, met Bickel’s 
gaze. “And what if they were tell- 
ing us to cease and desist?” 

“You know something,” Tim- 
berlake said, “the beginning and 
end of Hempstead’s message 
didn’t seem to be garbled at all.” 
“Standard call and sign-off,” 
Bickel said. “They could be 
recognized and translated from 
the smallest fractional bits.” 

“But the message load was 



53 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



lightest at the beginning,” Tim- 
berlake said. “And that could be 
part of the explanation there. 
You’d get minimum cancellation. 
We might be able to salvage more 
of the message . especially in 
the first parts before the load 
jammed it up.” 

This is exceedingly cautious 
tor Timherlake, Flattery thought. 
Is he coming around to Bickers 
viewpoint? 

Bickel found himself moving 
hesitantly, not knowing why, but 
unable to escape the logic in Tim- 
berlake’s argument. He slid out 
the message print, shuttled it to 
the replay rack. If only the print 
had been the first step in the re- 
ception, instead of intermediate, 
he thought. He removed his feed- 
back patches, sent the print di- 
rectly into the Ox and then into 
AAT, routed the read-out 
through the Optical Character 
Print system and the screen 
above them. 

Hempstead’s original call ap- 
peared there, and they all looked 
up at it. 

That had to be accurate, Bickel 
thought. 

There came that original long 
delay, then: “CHOOSE BY LOT

VIII 

F lattery had just shifted the 
Com-central board to Pru- 
dence. He looked across at Tim- 
berlake, who sat on the edge of 
his action couch staring at a 
memo pad of ship paper. The 
thin paper rustled faintly as Tim- 
berlake folded back a page, scrib- 
bled something on a clean sur- 
face. 



54 



GALAXY 



Flattery’s duty shift had ex- 
hausted him. He felt drained — 
and at the same time keyed up. 
Apprehensive. He felt that forces 
were gathering over which he 
could have no control. 

They had come to no solution 
of the communication problem. 
Or of any other. Perhaps, none 
was possible. 

He looked up at the monitor 
screen and observed it was 
blank. 

For a moment it did not regis- 
ter. He looked over to the con- 
sole in front of Prudence, saw 
that the command-circuit key 
pointed to “on.” But the screen 
remained blank. 

That key is on! Flattery told 
himself. 

But why was the screen blank? 

As though she read his mind, 
Prudence said: “John’s installed 
an override on the command cir- 
cuit. Any idea why?” 

“Didn’t you see where he 
was?” Timberlake demanded. 
“He was in the shop — working on 
that Ox mess!” 

Timberlake unlocked his ac- 
tion couch and in almost die same 
motion, launched himself at the 
hatch to the computer mainten- 
ance shop. He wrenched at the 
lock dogs, but they remained im- 
movable. 

“He’s jammed the lock!” Tim- 
berlake said. “If he wrecks our 
computer . .” 



“You noticed ... so you may 
as well watch.” 

It was Bickel’s voice. 

HP hey looked up to see a view 
-*• of the shop in their big 
screen. Bickel stood with the det- 
ritus of the initial Ox installation 
around him — dangling leads, me- 
ters, neuron blocks — all stacked 
precariously away from the com- 
puter wall. 

“Bickel, listen to reason,” Tim- 
berlake said. “You can’t just tear 
into . .” 

“Shut up or I’ll turn you off,” 
Bickel said. 

He knelt with a substitute 
neuron block, inserted it between 
the Ox and the computer wall, 
began making connections. 

“Please, John,” Prudence said. 
“If you’d . .” 

“You’re not going to stop him 
by talking to him,” Flattery said. 

“Listen to Raj,” Bickel said. 
He slipped another neuron block 
into place against the wall, made 
new connections. 

“Rhythm,” he said. “I went to 
sleep on it . and it woke me up. 
That and your yakking. Rhy- 
thm.” 

Another substitute neuron 
block went into place beneath the 
first two. 

“Describe what you’re doing,” 
Flattery said, and he motioned 
for Timberlake to come to his 
side. 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



55 



“Brain-vision anatomy can be 
reduced to the mathematical de- 
scription of a scanning process,” 
Bickel said. “It follows that any 
other brain -function anatomy — 
including consciousness — should 
submit to the same approach. I 
can duplicate the alpha-rhythm 
cycle for a brain-scanning sweep 
by setting it up in the time-cycle 
of these neuron blocks. If I trace 
each rhythm from a human 
model and duplicate . 

“What’s the function of each 
of these human rhythms?” Flat- 
tery demanded. 

As he spoke, Flattery scribbled 
a note on a pad of ship flimsy, 
pressed it into Timberlake’s 
hand. 

Timberlake looked up to the 
screen, but Bickel still had his 
back to the video eyes that 
matched the screen-view. 

“We don’t know the function 
for certain, do we?” Flattery said, 
and he motioned frantically for 
Timberlake to read the note. 

Timberlake turned his atten- 
tion onto the paper, read : 
“BACK WAY, AROUND THE 
HYB TANKS. BICKEL 
HASN’T JAMMED THE 
HATCH FROM QUARTERS. 
TAKE THE OTHER TUBE 
AND SURPRISE HIM.” 

Again, Timberlake looked up 
to the screen. 

The Ox was taking on new 
shape under Bickel’s hands — 



reaching out to the angle of the 
shop against the computer wall. 
It began to assume a feeling of 
topological improbability in Tim- 
berlake’s eyes — with jutting 

triangles of plastic, oblongs of 
neuron couplers, strips of Eng 
multipliers . and the color- cod- 
ed leads interweaving like a crazy 
spectrum. 

Timberlake felt a hand grab 
his arm, shake him. He looked at 
the hand, followed its arm to 
Flattery’s glaring face. 

Flattery gestured to the note 
in Timberlake’s other hand. 

Again, Timberlake looked at 
the note, recognizing why he 
stood rooted to this spot. 

Around the hyb tanks? 

No. 

It would have to be through 
the hyb tanks. 

Flattery must know that. 

Timberlake turned his tortured 
gaze on Flattery, bringing the 
terror up to full awareness. 

Bickel has infected me with hia 
cynical scepticism, Timberlake 
thought. I’m afraid of what I’ll 
find in the hyb tanks if I look 
too close. I’ll find the tanka 
empty, and nothing but leads 
back into the computer from 
the tanks. And the computer will 
be programmed to simulate the 
presence of hybernating life in 
those tanks. The whole thing will 
turn out to be a monstrous hoax. 

I’ll discover, I’ve been life- 



56 



GALAXY 



systems engineer to .. nothing. 
The thought set him shivering. 

I ’ll use the shot-effect generator 
again, Bickel thought. 

He leaned into the organized 
clutter of the Ox, clipped a lead 
onto the temporary input, thread- 
ed the lead out and draped it to 
one side. 

The effect and the way to 
achieve it were still clear in his 
mind. He had awakened sudden- 
ly, not knowing how long he had 
slept, but feeling refreshed and 
with this answer filling his mind. 

He turned to the computer 
leads, linked the Ox through a 
buffer that would feed its im- 
pulses into a test-memory bank, 
connected this to one of the new 
bank of neuron blocks, and put 
the system on full interlock. 

“Will you at least explain what 
you’re doing, John?” 

It was Flattery’s voice out of 
the screen. 

Bickel glanced back, saw Pru- 
dence at the controls, Flattery 
sitting on the edge of an action 
couch — no sign of Timberlake. 
But this screen’s eyes didn’t ex- 
pose all of Com-centraL It was 
probable that Timberlake was 
trying the hatch. 

Well, let him, Bickel thought. 
“We have only ourselves to use 
as models for producing this Con- 
sciousness Function,” Bickel said. 
“And everybody keeps saying we 



can’t get into ourselves the way 
an engineer should to duplicate 
the mechanism. But, friend, 
there’s another approach — thor- 
oughly tested and effective.” 

Prudence said: “Raj?” 

Flattery looked at her. 

“I’m getting current drive on 
the auxiliary power supply,” she 
said. 

“It’s the shop,” Flattery said. 
“John’s taken a direct line to pre- 
vent us from shutting him off.” 
He looked back at BickeL 
“Right?” 

“Right,” Bickel said. “It 
shouldn’t cause you any trouble. 
I’ve isolated the line. Your main 
board is still functioning.” He 
turned back to the Ox, began tie- 
ing in a series erf timed neuro- 
fibers. 

‘What’s the tested, effective 
method?” Flattery asked. He 
looked up at the telltales on the 
Com- central board, following 
Timberlake’s progress by the 
heat sensors. Timberlake was out 
in the second zone now, turning 
in toward the opposite side of 
the shielding and the hyb tanks. 

Why had Tim been so reluct- 
ant to go? Flattery wondered. 

Bickel finished a triple con- 
nection along the timed fibers, 
straightened, said: “The system 
you can’t tear apart and exam- 
ine is called a black box. If we 
can make a white box sufficient- 
ly similar and general in poten- 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



57 



Hal to the black box — that is, 
make it sufficiently complex — 
then we can force the black box, 
by its own operation, to transfer 
its pattern of action to the white 
box. We cross link them and sub- 
ject each to identical shot-effect 
bursts.” 

“What’s your white box?” Flat- 
tery asked, his interest and at- 
tention caught in spite of his 
fears. “That thing?” He nodded 
toward the crazy-block construc- 
tion of the Ox. 

“Hell, no,” Bickel said. “This 
is nowhere near complex enough. 
But our entire computer system 
is.” 

He’s gone crazy! Flattery 
thought. He can’t be suggesting 
seriously that he’d throw a scram- 
bling shot-effect burst into the 
computer! 

Again, Flattery glanced up at 
the telltales. Timberlake was at 
the edge of the hyb tanks, mov- 
ing at a maddeningly slow pace. 

“Then . how does the Ox 
function in this?” Flattery asked, 
returning his attention to the 
screen. 

“This is our sorter,” Bickel 
said. “It sorts the rhythms of the 
system and acts as a crude kind 
of frontal lobes.” He linked two 
parts of his construction by cross- 
jacks in a patchboard, said: 
“There. Now to run a few tests.” 

“Shouldn’t you wait?” Flattery 
demanded. “Shouldn’t we discuss 

58 



this a bit more? What if you’ve 
made a mistake and . 

“No mistake,” Bickel said. 

Flattery looked to the telltales. 
Timberlake was in the hyb tanks 
now, but he wasn’t moving — just 
stopped there. 

We set our 'organ of analysis’ 
at too high a pitch, Flattery 
thought. We should’ve known it 
could run wild. 

What was keeping Timberlake? 

“Straight line test, first,” Bickel 
said, and closed a key on the 
computer wall. He stared at the 
diagnostic-circuit dials above 
him. 

F lattery held his breath, turned 
slowly to look at the big 
board in front of Prudence. If 
Bickel’s test loused up the cen- 
tral computer system, it’d show 
up first on the big board. 

The warning flashboard re- 
tained its quiet green. The steady 
ticking of relays through the 
graph counters and monitors held 
at an even pace. Everything ap- 
peared soothingly ordinary. 

“I’m getting individual nerve- 
net responses on the separate 
blocks,” Bickel said. “Orthogonal 
nerve-net response in relation to 
the input.” 

Flattery kept his attention on 
the flashboard. If Bickel ruined 
the computer, the ship was dead. 
Most of the Tin Egg’s automatic 
systems depended on the com- 



GALAXY 



puter’s inner lines of communi- 
cation and supervisory control 
programs. 

“Didn’t you hear me?” Bickel 
demanded. “I’m getting nerve- 
net response! This thing’ll be- 
have like a human nervous sys- 
tem!” 

“Raj, he is!” 

It was Prudence, and Flattery 
dropped his gaze to where she 
was pointing. She had shifted a 
small corner of her own auxiliary 
board into a repeater system tied 
to Bickel’s diagnostic- circuits. 

“Beta rhythm,” she said, point- 
ing to the scope in the center of 
the board. 

Flattery watched the sine-play 
of the green line on the scope, 
digesting what Bickel had said, 
what that scope implied. 

Black box-white box. 

Perhaps it was possible, theo- 
retically, to use the entire com- 
puter as a white box to take the 
transfer-pattern called conscious- 
ness. But there remained many 
unanswered questions — and one 
more vital than all the others. 

“What do you intend using as 
a black box?” Flattery asked. 
“Where’ll you get your original 
pattern?” 

“From a conscious human 
brain,” Bickel said. “I’m going 
to take one of our spare hyb 
tanks and adapt the electro- 
encepholographic feedback sys- 
tem as a man-amplifier.” 



He’s utterly mad, Flattery 
thought. The shot-effect shock 
would kill the human subject. 

Bickel looked out of the screen, 
stared at Flattery — realizing 
that the psychiatrist-chaplain had 
seen the possible deadliness of 
this proposal. 

Who will bell the cat? Bickel 
thought. He swallowed. Well , if 
necessary , I will. 

“How would you protect the 
subject from the shot-effect 
bursts?” Prudence asked. 

“I believe the subject will 
have to be fully conscious,” Bick- 
el said. “Without any medication 
. or narco-inhibitions.” 

H e waited for the explosion 
from Timberlake. This idea 
was sure to outrage the condition- 
ing of the life-systems engineer. 
Where was Timberlake? 

“Absolutely not!” Flattery ex- 
ploded. “It’d be murder!” 

Prudence looked away from the 
console, met Bickel’s eyes. “Be 
reasonable, John,” she pleaded. 
“You’re already endangering the 
computer with that . 

“The ship’s still functioning, 
isn’t it?” Bickel countered, 

“But if you throw a shot-effect 
burst through that . .” She nod- 
ded toward the stacked blocks 
and interwoven leads of the Ox 
beside Bickel. “. how’ll you 
avoid damage to the computer’s 
core memory?” 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



59 



“Core memory’s a fixed system 
and buffered,” Bickel said. “I’ll 
keep the Ox’s potential below the 
buffer threshhold. Besides . 

He shrugged. we’ve already 
put shot- effect bursts through the 
computer without . .” 

“And scattered information,” 
she snapped. 

“We can still find that informa- 
tion if we use the Ox to sort the 
addresses for us,” Bickel said. 

Flattery glanced at the sensors 
in front of Prudence. What was 
wrong with Timberlake? Was he 
injured? Unconscious? But the 
sensors revealed a narrow path of 
movement from the life-systems 
engineer ... all of it within the 
hyb tank complex, though. 

“If I understand you correct- 
ly,” Prudence said, “you’ll have 
to add nerve-net simulation 
channels to the Ox until it and 
the computer are as complex as 
a human nervous system. As you 
build it and test it, we become 
more and more dependent on 
that jury- rigged Ox monstrosity 
for our very lives.” 

“It has to have a full range of 
sensory apparatus,” Bickel said. 
“There’s no other way.” 

“There must be!” she said. 
“Where’d you get such a mad 
idea?” 

“From you,” Bickel said. 
Shock momentarily stilled her 
tongue, then: “That’s impos- 

sible!” 



“You’re a female,” Bickel 
said, “capable of biological re- 
production of conscious life. In 
that method, you have a sub- 
strate of molecules that are cap- 
able of assuming a large number 
of forms . different forms. 
Those molecules assume a par- 
ticular form in the presence of a 
molecule that already has that 
form.” He shrugged. “Black box- 
white box.” 

“What about all those lives 
down in the hyb tanks?” Flattery 
asked. “Do they have any choice 
in this . game?” 

“They already made their 
choice,” Bickel said. 

“And while they’re helpless, 
you change the rules,” Flattery 
said. 

“That was one of the chances 
they accepted when they ac- 
cepted hybernation,” Bickel said. 
“That was their choice.” 

Flattery abandoned the argu- 
ment, pushed himself up. 

“What’re you going to do?" 
Prudence asked. 

“Check on Tim.” 

4C'fT7'here is Tim?” Bickel 
' ’ asked. 

“Down in the hyb tanks,” 
Flattery said, knowing Bickel 
could get the answer himself — • 
once he consulted the shop’s re- 
peaters. 

“Deep in the hyb tanks?” 

“Of course!” 



60 



GALAXY 



“Prue!” Bickel snapped. “Try 
to raise him on the command 
circuit.” 

She heard the urgency in Bick- 
tel’s voice, and immediately 
whirled to obey. 

There was no response from 
Timberlake. 

“You fools!” Bickel said. 

Flattery stopped at the tube 
hatch, glared up at the screen. 

“Who let him go down into the 
deep tanks?” Bickel demanded. 
“You blind idiots! Don’t you 
know what he’s likely to find 
down there?” 

“What do you mean?” Flat- 
tery asked. 

“This whole damn’ ship’s 
nothing but a simulation device,” 
Bickel said. “There’ll be nothing 
down there except a few crew 
replacements. Those tanks have 
to be empty!” 

He’s wrong! Flattery thought. 
Or is he? 

The thought staggered Flat- 
tery. He saw immediately how 
that might pull the props out 
from under Timberlake — a man 
tuned as fine as the rest of them 
for a specific function. 

“He’d still have the crew sys- 
tems,” Prudence said. She stared 
across the room at Flattery, feel- 
ing the loneliness — The Tin Egg 
with its programmed peril might 
contain only a few isolated hu- 
mans launched into nowhere. 

They wouldn’t, Flattery 



thought. But it they’d prepare 
me to cheat the rest of the crew 
. His feet felt rooted to the 
deck. He swallowed in a dry 
throat. 

But it’s impossible! They 
promised me when I discovered 
the actual Tau Ceti prints — if 
we succeeded we could just send 
back the report capsule and con- 
tinue as . There is no Tau Ceti 
planet! 

“Raj, are you sick?” Prudence 
asked. 

She studied him, seeing the 
lost, sunken look in his eyes. 

“The Tau Ceti planets are un- 
inhabitable, yes,” Hempstead 
had admitted when confronted 
with the evidence. “No Eden. 
But the universe is known to 
contain billions of inhabitable 
planets. You realize you can’t 
come back here, of course. The 
embarrassment to your hosts.” 

“The biopsy donors were all 
criminals,” Flattery had said, 
springing his other discovery. 

“Brilliant people, but mis- 
directed,” Hempstead had pro- 
tested. “That is one of the rea- 
sons you can’t come back, but 
nothing’s to stop you from going 
on to explore and find your own 
Eden.” 

Remembering the words, Flat- 
tery felt how hollow they sound- 
ed. 

Sham and trickery all the way, 
he thought. But why? 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM?

IX 

fp'imberlake had launched him- 
self down the metalo-plastic 
communications tube with a des- 
perate haste, knowing he had to 
move swiftly or become stalled 
in an unexplainable terror. 

At the tube- distribution lock, 
he sealed the hatch behind him, 
snatched a robox-monkey from 
its rack, tuned the sensors to the 
track imprinted in the tube wall, 
slammed its wheels onto the 
guide marks and grabbed the 
handhold controls. 

Again, he encountered that 
terrifying reluctance to move, 
and stared up the tube, studying 
the long, infinity-curve of it visi- 
ble through the transparent saf- 
ety locks. 

I can’t go back, he thought. 

With a sudden wrench, he 
twisted the little robox tow unit’s 
drive to full on, let it jerk him 
ahead along that curving track. 

The wind of his passage was a 
dim hiss. He was like a loose 
piston driving down that tube. 
Locks opened automatically to 
the robox signal, closed behind 
him. He slowed for the protec- 
tive jog through the shielding 
layer, twisted around through the 
branching outside the hyb tanks, 
dove back down along the flat 
angle that returned through the 
watershield and stopped in the 
lock chamber to the tanks. 



He racked the rooox, stared 
at the hatch. It was a big yellow 
oval, its seal warning in heavy 
blue letters: “THIS HATCH 

MUST BE CLOSED AND 
DOGGED BEFORE INNER 
HATCH WILL OPEN!” 

Now that he was faced with it, 
Timberlake felt a calm submis- 
sion to fate controlling his mus- 
cles. He gripped the hatch dogs, 
broke the seal, seeing the line of 
frost inside as the hatch swung 
open. His suit generators hum- 
med upscale, compensating for 
the drop in temperature as chill 
air spilled out of the lock. 

Timberlake slipped into the 
lock, closed and sealed the outer 
hatch, turned around. A rack of 
heavy-duty generators hung over 
the inner hatch with a big warn- 
ing sign above them: “EX- 

TREME DANGER! DEEP 
SPACE OR L-T SUIT RE- 
QUIRED BEFORE ENTER- 
ING THE NEXT LOCK. BE 
SURE YOU HAVE SPARE 
GENERATOR IN WORKING 
CONDITION BEFORE OPEN- 
ING THIS HATCH.” 
Timberlake looped the straps 
of a spare generator over his 
shoulder, gave the thing’s turbine 
drive a short burst to check it 
The generator hummed briefly. 
He swung the rack of them aside, 
broke open the next hatch, slip- 
ped through and dogged it be- 
hind him. 



62 



GALAXY 



Now, a smaller hatch greeted 
him, and lettered on its face: 
“ADMISSION ONLY TO 
LIFE-SYSTEMS ENGINEERS 
OR MEDICAL PERSONNEL. 
SUIT SECURITY MUST BE 
MAINTAINED AT ALL 
TIMES BEYOND THIS 
POINT. DO NOT OPEN THIS 
HATCH UNTIL YOU HAVE 
ADJUSTED YOUR SUIT FOR 
THE EXTREME LOW OF 
HYBERNATION TEMPERA- 
TURES.” 

Timberlake coupled the auxi- 
liary generator to his suit, check- 
ed both generators, adjusted 
them for temperature-security 
override. The remembered rou- 
tine occupied his awareness, 
keeping his mind off the space 
beyond that hatch. Suit seals 
slithered under his gloved fingers 
as he secured them. He dropped 
the non-fog viewplate over his 
faceplate, ran a check tape along 
the seals. 

The moment of final decision 
had come. 

npimberlake forced himself to 
act slowly and calmly. More 
than his own life depended on 
what he did now, he told him- 
self. Stray heat inside there 
could play havoc with helpless 
lives. He passed his suit’s baffles 
in front of a heat sensor, studied 
the gauge. 

Zero. 



His gloved hands went to the 
dogs of the inner hatch, broke 
the seal. The hatch popped 
slightly, indicating a small dif- 
ference in pressure — nothing 
abnormal. He stepped through 
into the glittering dry chill of the 
first bank of hyb tanks. This was 
where Prudence had been. He 
saw her empty tank on his left, 
its leads dangling, the cushioned 
carrier still open inside. 

Everything around him was 
revealed in harsh blue cold-light. 
He studied the chamber. 

It was like a giant barrel — 
an open space in the center sur- 
rounded by the smaller barrels 
that were the individual hyber- 
nation tanks. A grid-floored cat- 
walk led down the open center 
with short ladders and handholds 
branching up to the separate 
tanks. 

Timberlake kicked off down 
the length of the tank in three 
low-grav jumps, caught a hand- 
hold beside the breaker lock that 
separated this section from the 
next one. 

He looked back. No . they 
weren’t little barrels, he thought. 
The individual tanks stretched 
away from him — all around — 
like so many sections of gray 
culvert pipe waiting to be as- 
sembled into something useful 
. like a drain. 

There was no point examining 
the tanks in here, he knew. This 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



63 



was number-one section: high 

priority crew replacements. If 
there was deception, it’d be fur- 
ther along the line — in one of 
the deeper sections. 

Timberlake opened the safety 
value at the breaker lock, swung 
open the hatch, let himself 
through, reset the mechanism to 
isolate the section in the event of 
partial damage. 

He looked around the new sec- 
tion. It was the twin of the other 
one except for the absence of a 
raided tank. 

Timberlake swallowed. His 
cheeks felt damp and cold. A 
place between his shoulder 
blades itched. 

Quite abruptly, he found him- 
self remembering Professor Al- 
diss Warren, the lecturer in bio- 
physics back at UMB. He was 
a goat-bearded old man with a 
senile sounding voice and a mind 
like a scimitar. 

Why do I think of old War- 
ren — now? Timberlake won- 
dered. 

As though the question re- 
leased a hidden awareness, he 
recalled the old man diverging 
from a seminar discussion to talk 
about moral strength. 

“You wish to test moral 
strength?” he’d asked. “Simple. 
Construct a med-computer with 
a public callbox attachment. Set 
it that anyone submitting to the 
computer’s probes can find out 



to within a day or so when he’ll 
die ... of natural causes, of 
course. If you wish to call old 
age natural. Then you step back 
and see who uses the thing.” 

Someone — a feminine stu- 
dent in the back of the class — - 
had asked: “Wouldn’t it take a 
kind of courage not to use this 
computer?” 

“Pah!” old Warren had ex- 
ploded. 

Another student had said: 
“Hypothetical questions like this 
always bore the hell out of me.” 

“Sure,” old Warren had said. 
“You young toughs haven’t 
faced the fact we could build 
such a med-computer — right 
now, today. We’ve had the abili- 
ty to build it for more than thirty 
years. It wouldn’t even be very 
costly — as such things go. But 
we don’t build it.” 

npimberlake held himself still 
and silent in the hyb tank, 
realizing why he had remem- 
bered that incident. Coming into 
this cold-lighted tank was like 
using old Warren’s hypothetical 
death predictor. 

Bic.kel infected me with the 
certainty that this ship is not 
what it seems to he, Timberlake 
thought. He took over command, 
pushed me aside. The only rea- 
son for being here that was left 
me — He looked up and around 
the tank — was in here. If this 



64 



GALAXY 



is taken from me then Fm truly 
useless except as a kind of com- 
puter-shop flunky for Bickel. 

Yes, Bickel. Right away, Bick- 
el. Is there anything else, Bick- 
el? 

Presently, he launched himself 
up to an individual tank hang- 
ing low on the left curve, center. 
The tank was like all the others 
racked in curving rows around 
it. He activated the inner cold 
light, caught a handhold and 
bent close to the tank’s inspec- 
tion port. 

The light flickered, glowed. It 
illuminated the metered master 
tubes dropping from the tank’s 
other side, a color- coded sheaf 
of spaghetti that trailed down 
left and right to the figure under 
the light. 

A man’s craggy profile lay 
there, waxy skin and faint black 
beard. He was like a mannequin 
figure — and Timberlake 
thought immediately of elabor- 
ate human-size dolls racked here 
to maintain the pretense. 

Timberlake studied the life- 
systems telltales above the spag- 
hetti sheaf. They registered a 
faint flame of life within the 
tank. Timberlake made a tiny 
adjustment in the oxygen meter, 
caught the immediate feedback 
surge on the tank’s electroen- 
cephalographic coupling. 

The oxygen meter reset itself. 

This, then, was a hybernating 



man. That feedback reaction 
with its elaborate encephalo- 
graphic play, could not be pro- 
grammed for the unexpected. 
The oxygen shift at this mo- 
ment in time obviously could not 
have been anticipated. A human 
homeostate had detected it, 
though, and reacted correctly. 

Timberlake dropped down to 
the gridded catwalk, checked a 
tank opposite, and another far- 
ther down the line. 

He went through them at ran- 
dom, pausing only to check that 
each held a living human. 

One of them he recognized — 
black hair, olive skin with its 
waxy undertone, chiseled fea- 
tures — Frank Lipera, a fellow 
student in human engineering. 

Presently, Timberlake went on 
to the next section . and the 
next. He found he recognized 
many of the occupants. This 
filled him with a feeling of lone- 
liness. He felt that he might be 
the keeper of a museum, guard- 
ing old relics for a brief human 
lifespan, sequestering beneath 
these blue cold-lights a share of 
man’s culture and knowledge. 

He came at last to a corner of 
section seven, another recogniz- 
able face from his UMB past — • 
blond and germanic, pale wax 
skin. Timberlake read the name 
etched above the inspection port: 
“PEABODY, Alan— K-7a.” 

Yes, it was A1 Peabody, Tim- 

65 



DO 1 WAKE OR DREAM? 



berlake agreed. Yet, in a way it 
Wasn’t A1 . too. It was as 
though the companion of Tim- 
berlake’s gym classes, his oppon- 
ent in handball and moon tennis, 
had gone away somewhere to 
wait. 

But Peabody, Alan — K-7a 
proved to be a visable human 
within individual homeostatic re- 
actions. He could be awakened 
to speak and act and think. He 
could be wakened to conscious- 
ness. 

And consciousness is a thing 
beyond speaking and acting and 
thinking, Timberlake thought. 

TI e loosened the handhold, 
dropped lightly back to the 
catwalk, feeling no particular 
need to check further. He knew 
with an inner certainty that all 
the tanks held hybernating hu- 
mans. Bickel might be correct 
about the Tin Egg being an elab- 
orate simulation, but in here the 
simulation went too far in the 
direction of reality for it to be 
anything other than what it 
seemed. The hyb tanks had not 
been larded with obvious decep- 
tion. 

I was supposed to come 
through here, surprise Bickel and 
stop him, Timberlake thought 
Stop him from what? 

Some tiny, unregistered per- 
ception worked on the edge of 
Timberlake’s awareness, assur- 



ing him that whatever Bickel 
was doing right now in the shop 
held no immediate danger to 
these helpless sleepers. 

Whatever Bickers doing, he 
must be doing it right now, Tim- 
berlake thought. I’ve been gone 
. almost on hour. 

He looked up at the rows of 
tanks. 

Yet, every tank I checked was 
functioning at peak efficiency, as 
though the entire system were 
tuned to a critical optimum. 

Timberlake nodded to himself. 

You might almost think a 
mental core still rode monitor 
on the ship’s vital parts. 

He felt that he could almost 
hear the tremendously slowed 
oscillations of life around him. 

The spot between his shoulder- 
blade had ceased to itch, but he 
felt painfully tired now, slightly 
dizzy, his body dragging at his 
muscles. 

It occurred to Timberlake then 
that they could be going at the 
problem of reproducing con- 
sciousness too literally. Will we 
have to install mechanisms that 
permit the Ox to grow tired? he 
wondered. We’re too literal . 
like peasants asking the genie for 
three wishes. 

Maybe we won’t like our wish- 
es if we get them. 

God, I’m tired. 

Something moved near the far 
bulkhead — a space-suited figure. 



66 



GALAXY 



For one instant of unreality, 
Timberlake thought that one of 
his hybernating charges had re- 
vived itself. Then, the moving 
figure came full into the glare of 
the cold-light and Timberlake 
recognized Flattery’s features be- 
hind the anti-fog plate of the 
helmet bubble. 

“Tim!” Flattery called. 

His voice boomed from the 
suit amplifiers, echoed with a 
metallic ringing through the cold 
air of the tank. 

“Something wrong with your 
suit receiver?” Flattery asked, 
stopping in front of Timberlake. 

Timberlake looked down at 
the command set near his chin, 
saw that its circuit indicator light 
was dark. 

I left it off, Timberlake 
thought. Never even thought of 
turning it on. Why'd I do that? 

Flattery studied Timberlake 
carefully. The man’s motions 
when first seen across the tank 
had indicated nothing seriously 
wrong. He moved. He seemed 
aware of his surroundings. 

“You feel all right, Tim?” 
Flattery asked. 

“Sure. Sure ... I feel all 
right.” 

Like three wishes, Timberlake 
thought. Like the three S’ s of 
our school joke: Security, Sleep 
and Sex. 

Something touched his shoul- 
der, and he realized he had heard 



the inner bulkhead open. He 
looked around to see Bickel 
standing there. 

“You feel up to some work, 
you two?” Bickel asked. “I need 
your help.” 

X 

'T'he three men came to the 
inner locks and the back 
passage beneath the primary 
computer installation and up in- 
to the shop. They slipped 
through, sealed the hatch. 

Bickel threw back his helmet. 

Flattery and Timberlake did 
the same. Bickel already was 
loosening his glove seals. 

Timberlake stared at Flattery, 
watching the way the man stud- 
ied the jutting boxes and angles, 
the interwoven leads of the Ox. 

“Infinite counting net?” Flat- 
tery asked. 

“Why not?” Bickel asked. 
“You have it. Yqu can count be- 
yond the number of your own 
total nerve supply. The Ox has 
to do the same.” 

“You know the danger,” Flat- 
tery said. 

“Some of the danger,” Bickel 
admitted. 

“This ship could be one gigan- 
tic sensory surface,” Flattery 
said. “It’s receptors could achieve 
combinations unknown to us, 
could contact energy sources un- 
known to us.” 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



67 



“Is that one of the theories?” 
Bickel asked. 

Flattery took a step closer to 
the Ox construction. 

“Before you do anything de- 
structive,” Bickel said, and he 
nodded toward the patterned 
confusion clinging to the com- 
puter wall with its wire tentacles, 
“you’d better know I’m already 
getting conscious-type reactions 
on a low scale — the system itself 
activating various sensors. It’s 
like an animal blinking its eyes 
— a heat sensor here, audio 
there . .” 

“That could be a random dis- 
lodge pattern due to the shot-ef- 
fect bursts,” Flattery said. 

“Not when nerve-net activity 
accompanies each reaction,” 
Bickel said. 

Flattery digested this, feeling 
his conditioned fear-alertness — 
the reaction for which he was but 
a trigger — come to full ampli- 
tude. His mind focused on the 
two red keys and the self-de- 
struction program they would ig- 
nite through the computer-links 
of the ship. 

“Tim, how tired are you?” 
Bickel asked. 

Timberlake looked at Bickel. 
How tired am I? Minutes ago, 
he had been shot through with 
fatigue. Now . something had 
keyed him up, filled him with a 
feeling of elation. 

Conscious-type reactionsl 



“I’m ready for another full 

shift,” Timberlake said. 

“This thing’s too simple yet to 
even approach full conscious- 
ness,” Bickel said. “Most of the 
ship’s sensors bypass the Ox cir- 
cuits. Robox controls aren’t con- 
nected and it has no . 

(.(. Tust a minutef” Flattery 

J snapped. 

They turned, caught by the 
anger in Flattery’s voice. 

“You admit this goal-seeking 
mechanism may operate entirely 
outside your control,” Flattery 
said, “and you’re still willing to 
give it eyes — and muscles?” 

“Raj, before we’re finished, 
this thing has to have complete 
control of the ship.” 

“To get us across the big- 
empty and safely to Tau Ceti,” 
Flattery said. “You’re assuming 
that’s the ship-computer’s basic 
program?” 

“I assume nothing,” Bickel 
said. “I checked. That’s the basic 
program.” 

To Tau Ceti\ Flattery thought. 
He felt like both laughing and 
crying. He didn’t know whether 
to tell them the truth — the fools! 
But ... no; that would render 
them less efficient. Best to play 
the charade out to its silly con- 
clusion! 

“Can you prevent damage to 
the computer core?” he asked. 

“It’ll be buffered forty ways 



68 



GALAXY 



from Sunday,” Bickel said. "I’ve 
already started the buffering.” 

“What if it develops that it’s 
fatal to go to Tau Ceti?” Flattery 

asked. 

Why is he quibbling? Bickel 
wondered. Surely, he knows the 
answer to that. 

“A simple binary decision 
solves that,” Bickel said. “We 
give it a turn-back alternative.” 

“Ahhhhh,” Flattery said. “The 
best of all possible moves, eh? 
But we’re in the Queen’s croquet 
game. You said it yourself. What 
If the Queen of Hearts changes 
the rules? We’ve no Alice in this 
wonderland to haul us back.” 

A deliberately poor move 
somewhere along the line chang- 
ing the theoretical structure of 
the game, Bickel thought. That a 
an indicated possibility. 

He shrugged: “Then we get 
sent to the headsman.” 

Timberlake cleared his throat. 
He felt an overpowering curios- 
ity to inspect and test what 
Bickel had built — to trace out the 
circuitry and try to find why it 
wasn’t upsetting gross computer 
function. 

“If we run into the Queen of 
Hearts problem,” Timberlake 
said, “the ship stands a better 
chance if it’s controlled by an 
imaginative, conscious intelli- 
gence.” 

“Our kind of consciousness?” 
Flattery asked. 



There’s what’s eating him, 
Bickel thought. He’s obviously 
the one charged with seeing we 
don’t loose a killer machine in 
the universe. Homeostasis for a 
race can be different from the 
balance needed to keep an indi- 
vidual alive. But we’re isolated 
out here — an entire race in a 
test tube. 

“We’re talking about creating 
a machine with a specific qual- 
ity,” Flattery said. “It has to op- 
erate itself from the inside, by 
probability, and can’t be con- 
trolled by determinations from 
the outside. We can’t determine 
everything it’s going to do.” He 
raised a hand as Bickel started 
to speak. “But we can determine 
some of its emotions. What if it 
actually cares about us? What if 
it admires and loves us?” 

Bickel stared at him. That was 
a beautiful idea, an audacious 
idea — completely in keeping with 
Flattery’s function as chaplain, 
colored by his psychiatric train- 
ing, and protective of the race 
as a whole. 

“Think of consciousness as a 
behavior pattern,” Flattery said. 
“What has contributed to devel- 
opment of this pattern? If we go 
back . .” 

T Tis voice was drowned in the 
klaxon blare of the emerg- 
ency warning. 

They all felt the ship lurch 

69 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



and the immediate weightless- 
ness as the caged failsafe switch 
disconnected the grav system. 

Bickel drifted toward the for- 
ward end of the shop, caught a 
stanchion, swung himself around 
and kicked off toward the Corn- 
central hatch. 

He went quickly through 
the hatch in the same fluid mo- 
tion of opening it, slammed and 
dogged it, hurled himself toward 
his couch. He locked in, swept his 
gaze across his repeaters. 

Prudence was making only 
minimal corrections on the big 
console, studying the drain gaug- 
es. 

Bickel saw that the computer 
was drawing almost eighty per 
cent of its power-demand ca- 
pacity, began checking for fire 
and shorts. He heard cocoon 
triggers snap as Flattery and 
Timberlake took their places in 
their couches. 

“Computer drain,” Timberlake 
said. 

“Radiation bleed-off in Stores 
Four,” Prudence said, her voice 
hoarse. “Steady rise in temper- 
ature back of the second hull 
bulkheads . .no; it’s beginning 
to level off.” 

She programmed for a hull- 
security check, watched the sen- 
sor telltales. 

Bickel looking over her shoul- 
der at the big board, saw the im- 
plications of the flickering lights 



as soon as she did, said; “We’ve 
lost a section of outer shielding.” 

“And hull,” she said. 

Bickel lay back, keyed the re- 
peater screen for monitoring the 
sensors, began an analysis out- 
ward into the indicated area, 
said: “You watch the board; I’ll 
make the check.” 

Images flickered on and out in 
the little screen at the corner of 
his board as he keyed it to new 
sensors farther and farther out. 
Halfway through Stores Four, he 
was staring into the star-se- 
quinned darkness of open space. 
The sensor eyes revealed foam 
coagulant flowing into a wide, 
oval hole from the hull-security 
automatics. 

Out of the corner of his eye, 
Bickel saw Flattery running a 
micro-survey along the edge of 
the break in the hull. “It’s as 
though it were sliced off with a 
knife,” he said. “Smooth and 
even.” 

“Meteorite?” Timberlake ask- 
ed. He looked up from a check 
of the hyb tanks. 

“There’s no fusing at the edge 
or evidence of friction heat,” 
Flattery said. He took his hands 
off his board, thinking of the is- 
land in Puget Sound — the wild 
destruction in the surrounding 
countryside. 

Rogue consciousness. 

Has it started already? he 
asked himself.

( (XTThat could make that cut 
* * through the outer shield- 
ing and hull without heating 
them at least to half-sun?” 
Bickel asked. 

No one answered. 

Bickel looked at Flattery, see- 
ing the white, drawn look to the 
man’s mouth, thought: He 

knows ! 

“Raj,” Bickel said, “what 
could do that?” 

Flattery shook his head. 

Bickel took a reading on the 
laser-pulsed timelog off his own 
repeaters, extracted a position 
assessment, noted transmission- 
delay time to UMB, swung his 
transmitter to his side and keyed 
it for AAT coding. 

“What’re you doing?” Flattery 
asked. 

“This we’d better report,” 
Bickel said. He began cutting the 
tape. 

“How about some gravity?” 
Timberlake asked. He looked 
at Prudence. 

“System reads functional,” she 
said. “I’ll try it.” She thumbed 
the reset. 

The ship’s normal quarter 
gravity pulled at them. 

Timberlake unlocked his co- 
coon, stepped out to the deck. 

“Where’re you going?” Pru- 
dence asked. 

“I’m going out and have a 
look,” Timberlake said. “Some 
force takes a slice off our hull 



without crisping the area of 
spreading a shatter pattern? 
There is no such force. This I’ve 
got to see.” 

“Stay right where you are," 
Bickel said. “There could be 
loose cargo out there . any- 
thing.” 

Timberlake thought of lovely 
Maida crushed by runaway car- 
go, swallowed. 

“What’s to prevent it slicing 
us neatly right down the middle 
— next time?” Prudence asked. 

“What’s our speed, Prue?” 
Timberlake asked. 

“C over one five two seven,” 
she said, “and holding.” 

“Did . whatever it was slow 
us at all?” Flattery asked. 

Prudence ran the back check 
on the comparison log, said: 
“No.” 

Timberlake took a deep, quav- 
ering breath, said: “A virtually 
zero impact phenomenon with a 
force effect of . what? Infin- 
ity?” He shook his head. “There’s 
no kinetic equivalent.” 

Bickel tripped the transmis- 
sion switch, waited for the inter- 
lock, looked at Timberlake. “Did 
the universe begin with Gamow’s 
‘big bang’ or are we in the mid- 
dle of Hoyle’s continuous crea- 
tion? What if they’re both . .” 

“That’s just a mathematical 
game,” Prudence said. “Oh, I 
know: the union of infinite mass 
and finite sources can be ac- 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



71 



complished by postulating zero 
impact-infinite force, but it’s 
still just a mathematical game, 
a cancelling-out exercise. It 
doesn’t prove anything.” 

“It proves the original power 
of Genesis,” Flattery whispered. 

“Oh, Raj, you’re at it again,” 
Prudence said, “trying to twist 
mathematics to prove the exist- 
ence of God.” 

“God took a swipe at us?” 
Timberlake asked. “Is that what 
you’re saying, Raj?” 

“You both know better than 
to take that attitude — under 
these circumstances,” Flattery 
said. And he thought: When they 
get that message at UMB, they’ll 
know we’ve achieved the stage 
of rogue consciousness. There’s 
no other answer. 

prudence stared up at the big 
console, wondering what had 
happened to the ship. 

The damage had been caused 
by something outside the ship. 
There had been a faint lurch 
transmitted through the Tin Egg, 
but that had come afterward. 
The damage telltales already 
had been flaring out red and yel- 
low. The lurch had been assoc- 
iated with power drain and a 
shift of switching equipment to 
the necessities of automatic dam- 
age control. 

Zero impact-infinite force. 

Something outside the ship 



had sliced through them like a 
razor through soft butter. No — 
infinitely sharper. 

Something from outside. 

She put a hand to her cheek. 
That pointed to something be- 
yond the dangers programmed 
into the ship. 

They’d encountered something 
out of the wide, blank unknown. 
She thought suddenly of sea 
monsters painted on ancient 
charts of the earth, of twelve- 
legged dragons and humanoid 
figures With fanged mouths in 
their chests. 

She restored a degree of calm- 
ness by reminding herself that all 
these monsters had faded before 
humanity’s monkey-like inquisi- 
tiveness. 

Still — something had struck 
the Tin Egg. 

She ran another visual survey 
of her board, noting that auto- 
matic damage control had almost 
completely flooded out Stores 
Four with foam seal. Section 
doors were sealed off for two lay- 
ers around the damage area. 

Whatever had hit them, it had 
taken only a thin slice . this 
time. 

“Time for my watch,” Flattery 
said. “Prue?” 

Flattery’s words made her 
aware in a sudden rush of ac- 
ceptance how tired she was. Her 
back ached and the muscles of 
her forearms trembled. She could 



72 



GALAXY 



remember only once before hav- 
ing been this tired — after almost 
five hours of surgery. 

“On the count,” she said. 

They shifted the big board, 
and Flattery scanned the instru- 
ments, preparing to fit himself 
into the mood of the ship. 

And the Tin Egg does have her 
moods, Flattery thought. 

Sometimes, he felt as though 
the ship carried ghosts within it 
— of the sixteen men killed by 
accident during the construction 
on the moon, of umbilicus crew- 
members killed by the ship’s pro- 
grammed savagery — or perhaps 
of the OMCs sacrificed on this 
altar. 

Did those bodiless brains have 
souls? Flattery wondered. For 
that matter — it we breathe con- 
sciousness into this machinery, 
will our creation have a soul? 

“Have the automatics finished 
sealing the break?” Bickel asked. 

“All sealed,” Flattery said. And 
he wondered: When will the 

rogue consciousness hit us again? 

“What was in Stores Four?” 
Prudence asked. “What’d we 
lose?” 

“Food concentrates,” Bickel 
•aid. “First thing I checked.” 

His tone said: “You had the 
watch; you should’ve checked.” 

“Raj, do you want us to start 
sharing the watch and watch?” 
Timberlake asked. “After I’ve 
had some rest . 



“After you’ve had some rest, 
you can help me in the shop,” 
Bickel said. 

“We’ve just decided,” Pru- 
dence said, “just like that — ” she 
snapped her fingers — “that you 
can go on stirring around in the 
computer like a wild man?” 

“For Christ’s sake!” Bickel 
said. “Haven’t any of you real- 
ized yet we were supposed to use 
the computer as the basic ele- 
ment of attack?” 

B ickel stared around at them. 
Flattery busy on the board, 
Timberlake half asleep sitting up 
at his couch, Prudence glaring 
at him from her couch. 

“That’s no ordinary comput- 
er,” Bickel said. “It has elements 
we don’t even suspect. It was 
hooked up with an Organic Men- 
tal Core for almost six years 
during the construction and pro- 
gramming of the ship. It has buf- 
fers and leads and cross ties that 
its own designers may not even 
know about!” 

“Are you suggesting it’s al- 
ready conscious?” Prudence 
asked. 

“No, I’m not suggesting it’s al- 
ready conscious. I’m suggesting 
that we’ve come a long way us- 
ing that computer and our Ox 
frontal-lobe simulator. We’ve 
come farther than the UMB 
project did in twenty years! And 
we should go on with this. We’re

cutting a straight line through 
all the . 

“There are no straight lines in 
nature,” Flattery said. 

Bickel sighed. What now? he 
wondered. 

“If you’ve got something to 
say, spit it out,” Bickel said. 

“Consciousness is a type of be- 
havior,” Flattery said. “Agreed?” 

“Agreed.” 

“But the roots of our behavior 
are buried so far away in the 
past we can’t get at them direct- 
ly-” 

“Emotion again, eh?” Bickel 
demanded. 

“No,” Flattery said. 

“Instinct,” Prudence said. 

Flattery nodded. “The kind of 



genetic imprint that tells a chick- 
en how to crack out of its shell.” 

“Emotions or instinct, what’s 
the difference?” Bickel asked. 
“Emotions are produced by in- 
stinct. Are you still saying we 
can’t bring the Ox to conscious- 
ness unless it has instincts cum 
emotions?” 

“You know what I’m saying,” 
Flattery said. 

“It has to love us,” Bickel 
said. He chewed at his upper lip, 
caught again by the beautiful 
simplicity of the suggestion. Flat- 
tery was right, of course. Here 
was a loose rein that could satis- 
fy the failsafe requirements. It 
controlled without galling. 

“It has to have an autonomic 



74 



GALAXY 



system of emotional reactions,” 
Flattery said. “The system has 
to respond with a set of physical 
effects of which the Ox is . 
aware. Something like the char- 
acteristic human muscular re- 
actions and voice tones, the 
things we use to respond to emo- 
tions.” 

Emotion, Bickel thought. The 
characteristic that gives us our 
sense of person, the thing that 
summates personal judgments. 
A process in capsule form that 
can occur out of sequence. 

Here was a break with all ma- 
chine concepts of Time — Emo- 
tion as Process, an audacious way 
of looking at Time. 

“There’s nothing of ourselves 
about which we can be objec- 
tive,” Bickel said, “except our 
own physical responses. Remem- 
ber? It’s what Dr. Ellers was al- 
ways saying.” 

Flattery thought back to Ell- 
ers, UMB’s chief of psych. 
“Bickel is ‘purpose,’ the force 
that will give direction to your 
search,” Ellers had said. “You 
have substitutes, of courage. Ac- 
cidents do happen. But you’ve 
nothing honed as fine as Bickel. 
He’s a creative discoverer.” 

Emotion, Bickel thought. How 
do we symbolize it and program 
for it? What does the body do? 
We’re inside, in direct contact 
with whatever the body’s doing. 
That’s the only thing we can 



really be objective about. What 
does the body . 

“It has to have a completely 
interfunctioning body,” Bickel 
said, seeing the whole problem 
and answer as an abrupt revela- 
tion. “It has to have a body 
that’s gone through trauma and 
crises.” He stared at Flattery. 
“Guilt, too, Raj. It has to have 
guilt.” 

“Guilt?” Flattery asked, and 
wondered why the suggestion 
made him feel angry and half 
fearful. He started to object, grew 
conscious of a rhythmic rasping. 
He thought at first it was a mal- 
functioning alarm, realized then 
it was Timberlake. The life-sys- 
tems engineer had reclasped him- 
self in his action couch cocoon. 
He was asleep — snoring. 

“Guilt,” Bickel said, holding 
his attention on Flattery. “You 
want it to love us? Okay. Love’s 
a kind of need, eh? It’ll have 
emotions, but that means an un- 
limited spectrum of emotions, 
Raj. The spectrum includes 
fear.” 

G uilt and fear, Prudence 
thought. Raj will have to 
face it. His training won’t per- 
mit him to deny this. She looked 
at Bickel, seeing the filrned-over, 
withdrawn look in his eyes. 

“Pleasure and pain,” Bickel 
muttered. He focused on Pru- 
dence, the sleeping Timberlake, 



DO 1 WAKE OR DREAM? 



75 



on Flattery — each in turn. Did 
they see that the Ox had to be 
able to reproduce itself, too? 

Prudence felt her pulse quick- 
ening, tore her attention away 
from Bickel. She put a hand to 
her temple, checked the pulse 
there, related this to her quick- 
ened breathing, to body temper- 
ature, to hungers, to stage of 
fatigue and awareness. The sero- 
tonin/adrenalin she’d been fed in 
hyb was giving her an acute 
awareness of her bodily func- 
tions, and that awareness told 
her she needed chemical read- 
justment. 

“Well, Raj?” Bickel said. 

I must compose myself , Flat- 
tery thought, turning back onto 
his couch. I must appear natural 
and calm. He kept his eyes away 
from the false panel on his re- 
peater board. Bickel was grow- 
ing exceedingly alert to the tin- 
iest clues. Flattery marked the 
quiet green of the flashboard, the 
ticking of relays through the 
graph counters. Everything of 
the ship felt soothing and ordin- 
ary — all systems functioning. 

Yet, deep inside himself, Flat- 
tery felt knotted up, like an an- 
imal poised at the sound of the 
hunter. 

Bickel felt elation, a break- 
through in some inner factor that 
had resisted him. The ship — its 
living organisms, its problems — 
all were like marionettes and 



marionette toys. The way out was 
so clear to him. He’d only hinted 
at it before. So clear. He could 
see the necessary schematics 
stacked in his mind, like trans- 
parencies piled one on another. 

Four dimensional construction, 
he reminded himself. We have 
to construct a net in depth that 
contains complex world-line 
tracks. It has to absorb non- syn- 
chronous transmissions. It has to 
abstract discrete patterns out of 
the impulse oversend. The im- 
portant thing is structure — not 
the material. The important 
thing is topology. Thafs the key 
to the whole damn’ problem! 

“Prue, get us some food and 
coffee,” Bickel said. He glanced 
at the chronometer beside the 
Com-central board, looked at 
Timberlake. Let him sleep. 

Thinking within this frame- 
work, Bickel saw, put him on a 
threshhold. A certain pressure 
here, a certain application of en- 
ergy there, and he knew he would 
be projected into a consciousness 
that he had never before exper- 
ienced. 

The realization inspired fear 
and awe at the same time it 
lured him. He turned to Flattery. 

“Raj,” he said. “We’re not con- 
scious.” 

“What? Huh?” It was Timber- 
lake rousing out of his sleep, 
rubbing his eyes, staring straight 
out at Bickel. 



76 



GALAXY 



“We’re not awake,” Bickel 
said. 

XI 

Ci’fXTe’re not awake.” During 
’ ' Flattery’s watch, the 
words haunted him. 

Timberlake had muttered 
something about, “Damn’ joker!” 
and gone off to finish his sleep 
in quarters. 

But Flattery, dividing his at- 
tention between the console and 
the overhead screen that showed 
the shop with Prudence and 
Bickel at work there, felt the ship 
assume a curious identity in his 
mind. 

Flattery felt as though he and 
the other three crewmembers 
were merely cells of a larger or- 
ganism— that the telltales, the 
dials and gauges and sensors, the 
omnipresent visual intercom — 
that all these were senses and 
nerves and organs of something 
apart from himself. 

“We are noi awake.” 

We keep skirting that thought, 
Flattery reflected. 

Bickel’s voice talking to Pru- 
dence in the shop — “Here’s the 
main trunk to handle negative 
feedback. Follow the color code 
and tie it in across there. 
Here’s the damper circuit; We 
have to watch we don’t introduce 
reverberating cycles into the ran- 
dom neural paths.” 



And Prudence, talking half to 
herself: “The human skull en- 
closes about fifteen thousand 
million neurons. I’ve extrapolat- 
ed from our building blocks and 
the computer. We’re going to 
wind up with more than twice 
that number in this . beast.” 
Their voices were like echoes 
in Flattery’s mind. He thought 
of the total ship, the great ma- 
chine whose continued life re- 
quired a certain optimum organ- 
ization — an ordering process. 
That involved entropy, certain- 
ly, because the system that was a 
total ship tended to settle into a 
uniform distribution of its ener- 
gies. 

As far as the ship is concerned, 
order is more natural than chaos, 
Flattery thought. But we’re play- 
ing the ship as though all its 
parts were an orchestra and 
Bickel the director. Bickel alone 
has the score to achieve the 
music we want. 

Consciousness. 

CTphe identity that was the ship 
— their Tin Egg — it lacked a 
certain integrating ability at the 
moment. Instead of an efficient 
self-regulating force, the ship 
was making do with the inade- 
quate feedback system repre- 
sented by four humans loosely 
connected to its ‘nervous system.’ 
That was one way of looking 
at it. 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



77 



But there was a point in the 
ship’s future where damage 
passed beyond their ability to re- 
cover. The humans were failing 
to make the ship the living, dy- 
namic and interacting system it 
was designed to be. 

Flattery felt then a deep bit- 
terness toward the society that 
had sent his frail cargo into no- 
where. He knew the reasons, but 
reasons had never prevented 
bitterness. 

“Think of society as a human 
construction, a very sophisticat- 
ed defense mechanism Hemp- 
stead and his cohorts had said. 
“Society’s restrictions get bred in- 
to the cells themselves by a pro- 
cess of selection. And these re- 
strictions become part of the self- 
regulating feedback in society’s 
governing system. There’s a ser- 
ious question whether humans 
actually can break out of their 
self regulated pattern. It takes 
audacious methods, indeed, to 
explore beyond that pattern.” 

The law was stated, Flattery 
knew, thusly: “Individual human 
experience is not the overriding 
control factor in human behav- 
ior. The cellular social pattern 
dominates.” 

Flattery deliberately rapped 
his knuckles against the edge of 
his action couch to shock himself 
out of his reverie. He focused on 
the console, saw he had the us- 
ual temperature adjustments to 



make. The automatics could 
never quite hold the line. 

Bickel: “Watch those lengths 
in the time-delay circuits. You’ll 
confuse the Ox’s psychological 
present.” 

Prudence: “Its what?” 

Bickel: “Its psychological 

present — its ‘specious present’ — 
what you experience in any given 
instant; that short interval you 
call now. Professor Ferrel — re- 
member old Prof Ferrel-barrel?” 
Prudence: “Who could forget 
Hempstead’s son-in-law?” 

Bickel: “Yeah, but he wasn’t 
stupid. We were on the satellite 
tracker once — him on his side of 
the sterile wall and me on ours. 
And he said: ‘Look at that thing 
move!’ It was a shuttle ship com- 
ing in from earth. And he said: 
‘You know for a fact it’s chang- 
ing position fast as hell. But you 
seem to see all those position 
changes right now — in the pres- 
ent. No sharp edges; just a flow. 
That’s the “specious present,” 
boy. Don’t you ever forget it.’ 
And I never did.” ■ 

Prudence: “Will the . Ox 
really experience time?” 

Bickel: “It has to. Our time- 
delay circuits have to give it a 
way of internal measurement. It 
has to feel its own time. Other- 
wise, it’ll be a big package of 
confusion.” 

Flattery looked up into the 
screen, saw Bickel hook an oscil- 



78 



GALAXY 



loscope to the Ox, run a pulse 
check. 

Prudence: “Aren’t you likely 
to overload the computer, bog 
it down?” 

Bickel: “For Chrissakes, wom- 
an! You personally receive all 
kinds of information constantly. 
Doesn’t your own system sort 
through all that information, 
queue it up, program it and eval- 
uate the data?” 

Prudence: “But the Tin E££’s 
very existence depends on the 
computer. If we blunder — ” 
Bickel: “There’s no other way. 
You should’ve realized that the 
instant you saw this whole ship 
was a set piece.” 

Prudence (angrily) : “What do 
you mean? Why?” 

Bickel: “Because the comput- 
er’s the only place where that 
amount of information can be 
stored. You see, woman, we don’t 
have time to train a completely 
uneducated infant.” 

jf>efore she could answer, the 
transmission horn blared its 
warning. 

The AAT stood on manual by- 
pass to keep its circuits from in- 
terfering with the work in the 
shop. The horn was a trigger that 
fired both Bickel and Flattery 
into action. Bickel threw the ac- 
tion switch in the shop. Flattery 
slapped the AAT master control 
switch on his console, realizing 



with a sense of detachment that 
the UMB message would pour 
through the Ox’s circuits before 
being displayed for them. 

Bickel swept his gaze across 
the repeater telltales in the shop, 
watched the needles kick over 
and come to rest in the normal 
range. There came the character- 
istic sharp AAT hum, felt now in 
the shop because the Ox was part 
of the circuitry. The sound raised 
a tingling sensation along Bickel’s 
sides and arms. 

The gauges registered the us- 
ual AAT pause. The multiple 
bursts of the message were being 
sorted, compared, translated and 
fed into the output net. 

Bickel glanced at the screen, 
saw that Flattery had the system 
on audio. 

Morgan Hempstead’s voice be- 
gan rolling from the vocoders:

TION MARK” 

Bickel watched his gauges. The 
message was coming in with re- 
markable clarity, no garbling at 
all apparent now that it was 
routed through the Ox’s circuits. 

There came the distinct sound 
of Hempstead clearing his throat. 

It gave Prudence a peculiar 
feeling to hear this ordinary 
sound — a man clearing his throat. 
The inconsequential thing had 
been transmitted millions of 
miles to no effect other than to 
inform them Hempstead had 
been troubled by a bit of phlegm. 

Again, Hempstead’s voice 
rolled from the vocoders: “UMB 
IS BEING SUBJECTED TO 
HEAVY POLITICAL PRES- 
SURES AS REGARDS ABORT 
ORDER PERIOD YOU WILL 
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS 
TRANSMISSION IMMEDI- 
ATELY PERIOD SHIP IS TO 
BE RETURNED TO ORBIT 
AROUND UMB WHILE DIS- 
POSITION IS MADE OF 
YOURSELVES AND CARGO 
PERIOD” 

“That’s an awful word — dis- 
position,” Prudence said. She 
glanced at Bickel. He seemed to 
be taking it calmly. 

Flattery could feel the heavy 
beating of his heart, wondered 
if the next few words would 



bring that deadly “kill ship” coda 
signal from Hempstead. 

Bickel stared at the vocoder 
with a puzzled frown. How clear 
Hempstead’s voice sounded — 
even to the throat-clearing which 
the AAT should have filtered 
from the message. He shifted his 
attention to the Ox’s surrealistic 
growth on the computer wall. 

Again, Hempstead’s voice in- 
truded : “EXPECT THIS 

TRANSMISSION A MORE 
COMPLETE ANALYSIS 
YOUR DAMAGE PERIOD NA- 
TURE AND EXTENT OF 
DAMAGE OF PARAMOUNT 
IMPORTANCE PERIOD AC- 
KNOWLEDGE AT ONCE PER- 
IOD PROJECT OVER AND 
OUT PERIOD” 

Bickel kept his voice low, cas- 
ual, said: “Prue, how’d old Big 
Daddy sound to you?” 

‘Worried,” Prudence said. And 
she wondered why Bickel with 
his inhibitions against return 
could take this so calmly. 

“If you wanted to convey the 
emotions in some one’s message, 
how would you do it, Prue?” 
Bickel said. 

She looked at him, puzzled. 
“I’d say what the emotion was 
or imitate the tone of the orig- 
inal. Why?” 

“The AAT isn’t supposed to be 
able to do that,” Bickel said. 
He looked up, meeting Flat- 
tery’s eyes in the screen. “Don’t 



80 



GALAXY 



acknowledge that transmission, 
Raj.” 

Flattery nodded. 

UX^ou mean the AAT’s work- 
* ing better than ever?” 
Prudence asked uncertainly. 

“No,” Bickel said. “It’s work- 
ing in a way it shouldn’t be able 
to. The laser-burst message is 
stripped to bare essentials. The 
original voice modulations are 
there, theoretically, and often 
strong enough to recognize cer- 
tain mannerisms, but subtle- 
ties are supposed to be beyond it. 
That last message was high fidel- 
ity.” 

“The Ox’s circuits make the 
system more sensitive,” she said. 

“Maybe,” Bickel said. 

“Was there nerve-net activity 
accompanying that?” Flattery 
asked. 

“A fish has nerve-net activity,” 
Bickel said. “Nerve-net activity 
doesn’t mean the thing’s con- 
scious.” 

“But sensitized the way con- 
sciousness is,” Flattery said. 
“Showing refined results out of 
neuro-economy the way con- 
sciousness does.” 

Bickel nodded. 

“Selective raising and lower- 
ing of threshholds,” Flattery 
said. “Threshhold control.” 

Again, Bickel nodded. 

“What’s this?” Prudence 
asked. 



“This thing . .” Bickel pointed 
to the Ox. “. has just demon- 
strated threshhold control . 
the way we do when we recog- 
nize something.” He looked at 
her. “When you lower your re- 
ception threshhold, you spread 
the spatio-temporal message and 
project it across an internal ‘rec- 
ognition aura’ of your mental 
comparison system. The message 
is a spatio-temporal configura- 
tion which you superimpose on 
a recognition region. That rec- 
ognition region can discriminate 
quite broadly between ‘just right,’ 
which is Maximum similarity, 
and a kind of ‘blurring off you 
could call ‘somewhat alike.’ 
Threshhold control does the tun- 
ing for this kind of comparison.” 
With precisely controlled mo- 
tions, Bickel returned to the cir- 
cuitry he had been working on 
when the UMB message inter- 
rupted him. He picked up a sheaf 
of fibers, noting the neuron tag 
on them, slid the sheaf into a 
micro-manipulator and finished 
the connection to a multi- jack. 

I n Com-central, Flattery 

stretched out his left hand, 
gripped the stanchion beside his 
action couch until his knuckles 
went white. 

Who can tell me where my 
soul might be? he thought. 

The words of the 139th Psalm 
slithered through his mind: “/ 

81 



DO 1 WAKE OR DREAM? 



will praise thee; for I am fear- 
fully and wonderfully made." 

Have we betrayed God by 
making something fearful and 
wonderful? he wondered. 

“Our Father which art in heav- 
en,” he whispered. 

But I am in the heavens, he 
thought. And the heavens expose 
me still to spiritual risk! 

The sound of Bickel and Pru- 
dence working in the shop was 
almost a carrier wave for his 
thoughts. 

Faith and knowledge , he 
thought. And he sensed the et- 
ernal clash that had taken his 
body now as its arena — know- 
ledge thrusting at the boundaries 
of faith. And he felt the destruc- 
tive emotions his faith was en- 
gineered to contain. 

I could end this nonsense, he 
thought. But we’re all in the same 
bind and violence betrays us. 

“Religion and psychiatry are 
but two branches of the healing 
art.” He remembered the words 
clearly. The lecturer in Uses of 
Faith, the second-year course 
preparing him for this role. “Re- 
ligion and psychiatry share the 
same stem.” 

Heal thyself, he thought. 

Flattery ignored the vital con- 
sole in front of him, closed his 
eyes and gripped the stanchion 
fiercely. “The Lord is my shep- 
herd,” he whispered. “I shall 
not want” 



But the words had lost their 
power over him. 

There are no still waters here 
. or green pastures, he thought. 

There never had been these 
things for him — or for any of 
them out of the axolotl tanks and 
the UMB’s sterile creches. 
There had only been the valley 
of the shadow of death. 

“DO NOT BROACH THIS 
HATCH WITHOUT READING 
AIR PRESSURE IN THE 
NEXT PASSAGE.” 

Every morning on his way to 
classes — eleven years — he had 
passed through the hatch with 
that warning. 

“NO TRAVEL BEYOND 
THIS POINT WITHOUT 
FULL SPACESUIT.” 

That omnipresent sign had set 
the boundaries on their untram- 
meled activity. It still did. 

The suit was like another so- 
cial inhibition setting its own 
limits of behavior. It restricted 
your contact with other humans, 
reduced you to code tappings 
and depersonalized vuphones 
where every person became like 
a dancing doll on an oscilloscope 
screen. 

The omnipresent enemy was 
the outside — that total absence 
of the things to support life, that 
emptiness called space. I was evil 
and they feared it — constantly. A 
rod and staff might comfort in 
the presence of space, but what 



82 



GALAXY 



you dreamed about was washed 
air and a womb-like enclosed 
cell where you could divest your- 
self of the damnable suit. This 
was the true source of comfort 
no matter if it came from the 
devil himself. 

The only table you could 
count on in the presence of this 
enemy was a squeezebottle slid 
from its rack. Oil on the head 
could only fog a faceplate. You 
had to crop your hair short and 
keep down the natural oils with 
detergent. 

“The whole universe is a mat- 
ter of chemistry and mechanics, 
of matter and energy,” he whis- 
pered. 

But only God was supposed to 
have complete control of manip- 
ulating the matter and energy. 

We aren't gods, Flattery 
thought. We’re blaspheming by 
trying to make a machine that 
thinks of itself by itself. That 
is why 1 was set to watch over 
this mission. We blaspheme by 
trying to put a soul into a ma- 
chine. I should go down there 
now and smash the whole thing! 

(Crjaj!” It was Bickel’s voice 
booming from the inter- 
com. 

Flattery looked up at the 
screen, his mouth suddenly dry. 

“I’m getting independent ac- 
tion on the photosensory loops of 
the computer’s record-and-store 



circuits,” Bickel said. “Prue, 
check the current drain.” 

“Normal,” she said. “It’s no 
short circuit.” 

“It . isn’t conscious,” Flat- 
tery said, his voice wooden. 

“Agreed,” Bickel said. But 
what the hell is it? The comput- 
er’s programming itself in every 
. .” There came a charged mo- 
ment of silence, then: “Damn!” 
“What happened?” Prue de- 
manded. 

“It stopped,” Bickel said. 

“What ... set it off?” Flattery 
asked. 

“I tied an inhibitor block into 
one arm of a single nerve-net 
simulator and sent a test pattern 
through it. The test evidently 
set up a resonant pattern that 
searched right through the Ox 
and into the computer net via 
the monitor connections. That’s 
when I started getting the self- 
programming reaction.” 

Prudence sighted along her 
finger, moving it to trace a thick 
color-coded connection that 
looped down from the Ox. “The 
monitor linkage goes only one 
way into record-and-store,” she 
said. “It’s buffered right there.” 

Bickel pulled the connection 
she indicated. 

“What’re you doing?” she 
asked. 

“Disconnecting,” he said. “I’m 
going to get the pattern of the 
experiment out of the memory

banks and analyze it before pro- 
ceeding.” Silence. 

Flattery stared up at the screen 
with a feeling of horror. 

If I destroy it now, he won- 
dered, will I be . killing . 
someone ? 

XII 

o outine sensor firings sent teH- 
tale lights flickering across 
the computer wall. The passage 
of the lights produced a weird 
shift in the shop’s illumination. 
The curved bulkhead opposite 
the computer face reflected yel- 
low, then green, now mauve . 
red. 

The color shift passed across 
a chart in Timberlake’s hand as 
he read it and compared the 
chart’s predictions with the read- 
ings in front of him. 

The overhead screen showed 
Prudence on Com-central about 
midway through her watch and 
Flattery in his action couch. 

Strange he wouldn’t take off 
for quarters, Timberlake thought. 

Bickel emerged from between 
the Ox’s two branchings just as 
a wash of green splashed down 
on him from the wall. 

“We’re missing something,” he 
muttered. 

Timberlake wondered at the 
fear in Bickel’s voice, the way 
the man’s head turned from side 
to side like a caged animal. 



“If this thing takes off on its 
own, we have no control over it,” 
Bickel said. “Raj is right” 

“Raj’s golem and monster hor- 
ror stories!” Timberlake said. 

“No,” Bickel said. “This thing 
has new kinds of memories. They 
have only the vaguest relation- 
ship to human memories. But 
memories, Tim — the nerve nets 
stacked in psycho spaces — they’re 
the patterns that create behavior. 
What’s this thing going to do 
when we turn it on ... if we 
don’t give it experiences of the 
kind the human race has sur- 
vived?” 

“You don’t know what the rac- 
ial trauma are and that’s where 
you’re hung up.” 

The voice was Flattery’s, and 
they looked up to the overhead 
screen to see him sitting still half- 
cocooned in his action couch and 
rubbing sleep from his eyes. Be- 
yond him, Prudence maintained 
her vigil at the big board as 
though that were the only thing 
concerning her. 

Bickel suppressed a feeling of 
irritation with Flattery, said: 
“You’re the psychiatrist. Isn’t 
knowledge of trauma supposed to 
be one of your tools?” 

“You’re asking about racial 
trauma,” Flattery said. “We can 
only guess at racial trauma.” 
Flattery stared out of the 
screen at Bickel, thinking: John’s 
panicky. Why? Because the Ox 



84 



GALAXY 



suddenly started acting on its 
own? 

( 4TI7 e have to bring this thing 
into being,” Bickel said, 
looking at the Ox. “But we can’t 
be sure what it is. This is the ul- 
timate stranger. It can’t be like 
one of us. And if it’s different 
. yet alive and aware of its 
aliveness . .” 

“So you start casting around 
in your mind for ways to make 
it more like us,” Flattery said. 

Bickel nodded. 

“And you think we’re the 
products of our racial and per- 
sonal trauma?” Flattery asked. 
“You don’t think consciousness is 
the apparent effect of a recep- 
tor?” 

“Dammit, Raj !” Bickel 
snapped. “We’re within a short 
leap of solving this thing! Can’t 
you feel that?” 

“But you wonder,” Flattery 
said, “are we making a creature 
that’ll be invulnerable ... at 
least invulnerable to us?” 

Bickel swallowed. 

“You think,” Flattery said, 
“this beast we’re creating has no 
sexual function; it can’t possibly 
be like us. It has no flesh; it 
can’t possibly know what flesh 
fears and loves. So now you’re 
asking : How do we simulate flesh 
and sex and the racial sufferings 
through which humans have 
blundered? The answer’s ob- 



vious: We can’t do this. We don’t 
know all our own instincts. We 
can’t sort the shadows and reflec- 
tions out of our history.” 

“We can sort out some of 
them,” Bickel insisted. “We have 
an instinct to . win ... to sur- 
vive for . .” He wet his lips with 
his tongue, looked around at the 
computer wall. 

“Perhaps that’s only hubris,” 
Flattery said. “Maybe this is just 
monkey curiosity and we won’t 
be satisfied until we’ve been 
creators the way God’s a creator. 
But then it may be too late to 
turn back.” 

As though he hadn’t heard, 
Bickel said: “And there’s the 
killer instinct. That one goes 
right down into the slime where 
it was kill or be killed. You can 
see the other side of it all the 
time in our instinct to play it 
safe ... to ‘be practical.’ ” 

He has done something secret, 
Flattery thought. What has Bick- 
el done? He has done something 
he’s afraid of. 

“And guilt feelings are grafted 
right onto that killer instinct,” 
Bickel said. “That’s the buffer . 
the way we keep the instinct 
within limits. If we implant . .” 

“Guilt involves sin,” Flattery 
said. “Where do you find in 
either religion or psychiatry a 
need for sin?” 

“Instinct’s just a word,” Bickel 
said. “And we’re a long way from 



DO 1 WAKE OR DREAM? 



85 



tlie word’s source. Why is it? We 
can raise fifty generations of 
chickens from embryo to chick in 
test tubes. They never see a shell. 
But the fifty-first generation, 
raised normally under a hen, still 
knows to peck its way out.” 

“Genetic imprint,” Flattery 
said. 

“Imprint.” Bickel nodded. 
“Something stamped on us. 
Stamped hard. Oh, we know. We 
know these instincts without ever 
bringing them to consciousness. 
They’re what lower our aware- 
ness, make us angry, violent, pas- 
sionate . Again, he nodded. 

What has he done? Flattery 
asked himself, staring out of the 
screen. He’s panicky because of 
it. I have to find out! 

“The Cain and Abel syn- 
drome,” Bickel said. “Murder and 
guilt. It’s back there someplace 
. stamped inside us. The cells 
remember.” 

nphey glared at each other, 
-*■ Bickel desperate with indeci- 
sion, and Flattery’s suspicions 
verging on certainty. 

He has given the Ox the means 
to kill, Flattery thought. His ar- 
gument and his anger betray it. 
But kill what? Not one of us, cer- 
tainly. A colonist in the hyh 
tanks? No. One of the stock an- 
imals! He’d dip his toe into vio- 
lence first, see if the Ox could 
really do it. 

86 



But he cannot have already 
made the black box-white box 
transfer. 

Prudence, dividing her atten- 
tion between the control console 
and the clash of wills, felt her- 
self shift farther and farther into 
a state of heightened awareness. 
She sensed Com-central’s minute 
temperature variations, heard the 
constant metallic crealcings of 
deck and bulkheads around her, 
saw Flattery’s growing suspicions 
and Bickel’s desperate defensive- 
ness, knew her own heartbeats 
and tiny variations in her body 
chemistry. 

It was the chemistry that fas- 
cinated her: the thought that all 
through this subtle play of organ- 
ic and inorganic matter which she 
called herself, messages of which 
she was only dimly aware (if 
at all) were being transmitted 
and acted upon. 

The computer with its enor- 
mous library of data culled from 
millions of minds had offered her 
a way to explore the issue Bickel 
had raised, and she could not re- 
sist this. Where and how were 
the instincts carried? 

While the argument between 
Flattery and Bickel raged, she 
had translated the question onto 
an edge-coded tape, shifted it 
into the computer console section 
of her board, tripped the action 
switch. 

This went beyond chemical- 
GALAXY 



base sequence, she knew, and in- 
to the area where knowledge of 
protein structure itself was only 
theoretical code. But if the com- 
puter gave her an answer that 
could be translated into a phys- 
ical function, she knew she could 
explore the answer through new 
experiments on her own body. 

“Bickel, whatVe you done?” 
Flattery demanded. 

Prudence looked up from her 
console, saw Flattery, his shoul- 
ders tensed as though about to 
leap, staring into the screen 
tuned to the shop. The screen re- 
vealed Bickel and Timberlake, 
their backs turned, staring at the 
computer wall and the blocks- 
and- angles contortion that was 
the Ox. 

The hum of the computer 
could be felt throughout the shop 
and Com-central. The play of 
sensor and telltale lights across 
the board had reached a glittering 
tempo. 

Prudence put the back of her 
left hand over her mouth, hor- 
rified realization flooding her: 
He has routed the whole com- 
puter through the Ox! 

“What’ve you done?” Flattery 
repeated. 

“Nothing!” Bickel said without 
turning. 

Timberlake said : “Shouldn’t 
we . .” 

“Leave it alone!” Bickel 
snapped. 



In a low voice, Prudence said: 
“I did it I fed a question into 
the computer.” 

“What question?” Bickel de- 
manded. He pointed to a large 
meter above him. “Look at that 
current drain! I’ve never seen 
anything like it.” 

“I traced out sixty-eight se- 
quential steps of Fourth order 
bio-chemical configuration,” Pru- 
dence said. “I programmed it 
as a comparator of optical isom- 
ers as a first step in trying to de- 
tect where and how our instincts 
are imprinted on us.” 

“It’s gone into tire monitor 
banks,” Bickel said, nodding at 
a new play of lights on the wall. 
“We’re getting multi-track rein- 
forcement . 

“Like a man concentrating on 
a tough problem,” Timberlake 
said. Bickel nodded. 

r _ p'he output beside Prudence 
began hissing as tape sped 
from it into the strip viewer. 

Bickel whirled. “What’re you 
getting.” 

She studied the viewer, forcing 
calmness. “A pyramided answer,” 
she said. “I only asked for the 
first four probables. It’s already 
into the tenth step! It’s the nu- 
cleic acids, all right . down 
there with the genetic informa- 
tion. But it’s tracing out all the 
dead ends . the molecular 
weights and . " 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



87 



“It’s talking it over with you,” 
Bickel said. “It’s asking your 
opinion. Cut in on it and elimin- 
ate the obvious dead ends as you 
see them.” 

Prudence scanned back along 
the strip viewer, checked off 
useless sequences. Hydrogen 
catalysis . obviously not. Too 
much opportunity for contamin- 
ation. She cut into the output 
tape, began deleting and feeding 
the tape back into the computer. 

Output went suddenly silent, 
but the play of lights against the 
computer wall raised to a new 
frenzy. Power drain showed a 
new surge with a pulse in it. 

“Are you feeding a resonant 
cycle into the system?” Prudence 
asked. She was surprised how 
much effort it took to hold her 
voice level. 

“That pulse is identical to the 
timing of the Ox’s response 
loops,” Bickel said. 

As he spoke, the output beside 
Prudence renewed its chattering. 
Tape surged into the strip viewer. 

Prudence stared at if silently. 

“Well, what is it?” Bickel de- 
manded. 

The output tape rolled to a 
stop. In the abrupt hush, Pru- 
dence said: “It’s linked to acid 
phosphatase . amino add 
catalysis.” 

“Is it . consdous?” Flattery 
whispered. 

Bickel looked up at the com- 



puter wall where lights were 
winking out, leaving only that 
somnolent play of telltales — 
green . mauve . gold . 

“No,” Bickel said. “We’ve 
merely produced a computer that 
can program itself, concentrate 
all its bits of information on a 
problem . hunt for data even 
if that data comes from outside 
its banks.” 

“And that isn’t conscious?” 
Timberlake demanded. 

“Not the way we are,” Bickel 
said. “You have to ask it a ques- 
tion before it . comes to life.” 

“Acid phosphatase,” Prudence 
mused. “What do we know about 
acid phosphatase?” 

“Widely distributed in the 
body,” Flattery said. He turned, 
looked at Prudence as though 
seeing her for the first time. She 
would understand, of course — 
almost at once. He looked up to 
the screen at Timberlake and 
Bickel. They might have to have 
it explained to them. He returned 
his attention to Prudence. How 
thin and tired she looked. 

Prudence nodded to herself, 
eyes glazed in thought “Body 
chemistry, yes,” she said. “Male 
prostate’s rich in acid phospha- 
tase. Males store more of it than 
females.” 

Flattery spoke cautiously: 
“Body tissue requires a minimum 
level before a person can be 
awakened.” 



88 



GALAXY 



XIII 



She jerked upright, met his 
gaze, said: “An enzyme involved 
in the physiology of sex and 
awakening.” She turned away, 
thinking: Sex and awakening. 

“Is that what anti-S suppress- 
es?” Bickel asked. 

“Not directly,” Timberlake 
said. “A-S works primarily on 
serum phenol sulf a tase discrim- 
ination, inhibits transfer and 
action.” 

Timberlake, the life-systems 
specialist, the biophysicist, would 
see it, too, Flattery thought. 

Flattery looked into the screen, 
seeing Bickel standing there so 
silent and thoughtful, feeling a 
sudden pity for the man. Such a 
simple fact: awakening and sex 
are tied together. 

Prudence, reviewing the experi- 
ments on her own body, kept her 
face turned toward the big con- 
trol board, studied it without 
really seeing it. The ship could 
have gone into wild gyrations at 
the moment and she would have 
been seconds responding. As she 
had looked at Flattery, she had 
seen what he was thinking as 
though there were words written 
on his forehead. 

Consciousness linked to repro- 
duction. 

There was no doubt of it: both 
came out of the same genetic 
well. History had washed them in 
the same waters, transferring the 
needs of one to the other. 



Qlowly, Bickel turned, looked 
M through the screen at the 
big laser-pulsed autolog in Corn- 
central recording the passage of 
Earth-Time. It recorded eighteen 
weeks, twenty-one hours and 
twenty-nine seconds. It clicked 
over another minute as he 
watched it. 

For most of those pulse-count- 
ed minutes, Bickel thought, the 
Tin Eggs crew had been under 
the pressures of a ship in peril. 
The danger was real, no matter 
its source or intent; he had only 
to study the report on damage 
accretion to confirm this. But 
the pressure on the umbilicus 
crew had started with the loss of 
the Organic Mental Cores. The 
pressure had started when they 
were no longer shielded by an- 
other consciousness. 

For the first time, Bickel 
turned his thoughts onto the con- 
cept of consciousness as a shield 
— a way of protecting its posses- 
sor from the shocks of the un- 
known. It was an “I can do any- 
thing!” answer hurled at a uni- 
verse that threatened you with 
everything. 

He lowered his attention to 
Flattery who still sat himself co- 
cooned in the action couch, see- 
ing the sense of defeat in the 
curve of the man’s shoulders and 
the set of his face. 



DO 1 WAKE OR DREAM? 



89 



Why is he so quick to accept 
defeat? Bickel wondered. It’s al- 
most as though Raj wanted de- 
feat. 

The answer came to him on the 
heels of the question: If you’re 
pro ammed for destruction, you 
hav a need for destruction. With 
a si v se of growing awareness, 
Bids ; turned to look at the Ox 
cons; action, focusing on the 
angles and blocks and the tangle 
of neuron connections. 

But I’ve programmed this 
beast for violence. 

Forcing himself to appear 
calm and natural, Bickel shifted 
the jackboard for a diagnostic 
check on the program, traced out 
the condition of the routine. His 
throat went dry as he scanned the 
read out. 

The embryo he had placed at 
the Ox’s mercy — it was dead. No 
. dead was too simple a word 
for what had happened to that 
embryo. It had been disinte- 
grated, torn asunder, broken 
down to its constituent molecules. 
The record was all here on the 
tapes and discs, betraying also 
the reason for the destruction. 

Prue’s question. 

The embryo had been sub- 
jected to a violent experiment 
in the computer’s search for in- 
formation. 

A violent and useless experi- 
ment. This certainly could not 
have produced much data — ex- 



cept for some of the more grossly 
apparent characteristics of acid 
phosphatase — and perhaps nega- 
tive data about her biochemist- 
ry- 

It’ll kill to get information, 
Bickel thought. It has an ability 
of sorts to accept motivation . 
if we give it motivation. 

“We’ve just lost another sen- 
sor,” Prudence said, reading the 
telltale on her board. 

“Second pi, fourth ring and in 
behind number five shielding 
layer,” Timberlake said. “That’s 
damn’ close to the hyb tanks.” 

“I’ll check it,” Flattery said, 
unlocking the bottom of his 
couch. He swung his feet to the 
deck, slipped his helmet forward, 
but left it unsealed. 

“Is there a robox-R in that 
area?” Bickel asked. 

“What’s the difference?” Flat- 
tery asked. “By the time we 
found one and traced out the 
control sequence . .” 

“Are we going to check that 
sensor or aren’t we?” Timberlake 
demanded. 

“I’m on my way,” Flattery 
said. I mustn’t let Tim pre-empt 
this job, he thought. I need the 
excuse to go past quarters for a 
quick check on what Bickel’s 
done. It’s something violent and 
dangerous. He has himself under 
very thin control. 

“Raj,” Prudence said. 

He turned at the hatch.

“That . thing down there in 
the shop could reproduce itself 
with no help from us. Every ma- 
chine tool, every robox monkey, 
every muscle and sensor is pro- 
grammed through the computer. 
Once the last tie-in is made . 

Flattery wet his lips with his 
tongue, ducked out through the 
hatch without answering her. 

CC'T^'hat goddam’ slowpoke,” 
-*■ Timberlake said. “I 
should’ve gone myself.” 

Prudence shifted a corner of 
her board to monitor Flattery’s 
progress. She glanced up at the 
screen. Bickel was staring back 
past her at the hatch where Flat- 
tery had gone. 

“Prue, do you have a fix on 
him?” Bickel asked. 

“He has a prime repair dolly 
and he’ll be at the trouble spot 
in another minute or so,” she 
said. 

“That thing’s down near the 
temperature- control shutters in 
the baffle to the hyb tanks,” Tim- 
berlake muttered. “Too god- 
damn’ close to them. You get- 
ting any heat shifts on the other 
sensor's?” 

“Nothing significant,” she said. 

Prudence flicked a switch, 
watching the shifting factors of 
temperature-weight-sound on her 
board, the telltales moving with 
Flattery. She hit another switch, 
said: “Raj, how much longer?” 



Flattery’s voice came out of 
the overhead command vocoder: 
“Another minute or so.” 

They waited in silence, listen- 
ing to the sounds of Flattery’* 
progress through the open com- 
mand vocoder. 

Prudence activated a guide 
beam to the dead sensor as Flat- 
tery passed the waterbaffles. 

“Baffles secure?” she asked. 

“All secure,” Flattery said. 

IT e dogged the last hatch, 
knowing the action would 
register in front of Prudence in 
Com-central. The action sent a 
faint fear response through him, 
though. He had symbolically cut 
himself off from the core of the 
ship. 

I’ll fix this sensor and get back 
to quarters as soon as I can, he 
told himself. It’ll seem natural 
for me to stop off there on my 
way back. I have to find out what 
Bickel’ s done, but I can’t make 
him suspicious. 

Flattery turned, studied his 
surroundings. He stood in the 
bulb-lock that served as a hub 
for outer-hull communications 
tubes in this sector. It was an 
oval for strength, about six met- 
ers across its short diameter, and 
seven meters deep. He oriented 
himself by the faint pull of ship 
gravity. 

The non-functioning sensor 
was up a tube that curved off at 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



91 



two o’clock on his right. Tube 
eight, ring K. The number 
checked. The failure would be at 
the five-line up there. He stared 
into the pale gray metal gap il- 
luminated by cold light. A green 
guide beam beckoned in the tube. 

Pruts remembered to set the 
guide beam, he thought. 

He took the repair dolly in his 
left hand, made the low-grav 
leap across to the tube and caught 
its access rung. He pushed the 
dolly ahead of him, setting its 
sensors on the printed track, fed 
it low power to pull him into the 
tube. 

The auto lock’s sphincter 
closed behind him. He suddenly 
remembered Anderson strangled 
in a rogue sphincter . but of 
course that was no problem now 
. with all the OMCs dead. The 
fact that one of the crew had to 
come out here and make this re- 
pair meant the dangers were of 
another sort — rogue conscious- 
ness. 

“Something wrong?” Prudence 
asked, her voice filling his hel- 
met. 

She saw the telltales stop here. 
Flattery thought. 

It gave him a feeling of reas- 
surance that she was so alert to 
his movements — or lack of 
movements. 

“Nothing wrong; just being 
cautious,” Flattery said. 

“You want Tim to come out 



and back you up?” Prudence 

asked. 

“I don’t need anyone to hold 
my hand!” Flattery snapped, and 
he wondered at the sudden anger 
he’d thrown into that rejection. 

“You’re at station Two,” Pru- 
dence said. “There’s video on 
Two. Check.” 

Flattery glanced up at the ring 
of sensors on the tube, saw the 
one circled with yellow for video, 
waved at it as he passed. 

The robox-R’s imprinted track 
curved slightly up the tube side 
to clear the base bulge for the 
next automatic lock. He went 
through, looked back as the 
transparent shutters squeezed 
closed behind him. The ship’s 
core felt so far away back there. 

He looked forward, letting the 
robox unit tow him with its faint 
hissing growl, letting the loneli- 
ness seep through him. With an 
OMC in control, an automatic 
robox repair unit could have been 
sent on this little chore. Mobility, 
that was the problem. Where 
there were fixed automatic repair 
units — along the outer hull and 
at the major bulkhead locks, at 
the baffles and core-integrity 
barriers — the ship took care of it- 
self with only a lit” ’ help from 
its crew. But let a little thing 
like this come up where you need- 
ed mobility and a decision factor. 
Then one of the crew had to risk 
himself. 



92 



GALAXY 



Flattery cursed the Tin Egg’s 
designers then. Hate poured out 
of him. He knew why they had 
done this — the “planned incre- 
ment of frustration” they called 
it. The ship’s designers didn’t 
have to experience the frustra- 
tion. 

He was at station Four now, 
coming up on Five. 

“Station Five coming up,” he 
said. “Hey!” He cut the power on 
the robox, braked himself against 
the station’s ring, stared up at the 
overhead arc of sensors. 

A neat, shiny hole plugged with 
gray foam-coagulant occu- 
pied the position where the 
multi-sensor had been. The yel- 
low-green-red code rings on the 
tube around the hole had not 
been touched. He swung his gaze 
around the tube and the other 
sensors. All appeared to be func- 
tioning. 

Flattery thought then of the 
island on Puget Sound — sensors 
missing mysteriously . person- 
nel missing. He felt cold sweat 
around his shoulders. 

Prudence’s voice filled his hel- 
met: “Anything to report?” 

He lowered the volume, said: 
“The multi-sensor seems to’ve 
been cut out in some way. It’s 
gone. The hole’s been plugged 
with foam.” 

“No foam automatics in that 
area,” Prudence said. 



“The things been plugged with 
foam anyway!” Flattery said, un- 
able to hide the angry irritation 
in his voice. 

Prudence said: “John, I’m get- 
ting a demand drain on the com- 
puter. Is it something you’re do- 
ing?” 

“Nothing,” Bickel said. 

Flattery turned his head in 
the helmet. Bickel’s voice had 
come in faintly as a pickup 
through Corn-central. Action in 
the computer! Flattery forced 
himself to act calmly, removed a 
replacement sensor from his ro- 
box unit’s parts compartment, 
checked it. The thing was about 
three inches in diameter contain- 
ing a warp-type thermal detec- 
tor, standard vid-eye pickups like 
tiny jewels on its face, and three 
gridded ducts leading in to the 
membrance of the audio unit. 

Out of the corner of one eye. 
Flattery detected movement up 
the tube. He jerked upright, 
banged his head against the hel- 
met liner, stared up toward sta- 
tion Six’. 

A robox-R with its tool exten- 
sors clamped tightly to its sides 
was moving along the tape track 
toward him. The thing acted sick 
— speeding and slowing. 

His first thought was that Pru- 
dence had traced the robox re- 
mote controls for a unit in this 
area and was maneuvering the 
thing from her board. The crudi- 



DO 1 WAKE OR DREAM? 



93 



ty o£ Com-central’s controls over 
the robox series would account 
for the unit’s erratic behavior. 

“You bringing another robox 
in here, Prue?” Flattery asked. 

“No,” she said. “Why?” 

“There’s another robox-R com- 
ing down on this station.” 

As he watched, the thing lost 
the tape track, relocated it. 

“There can’t be!” she said. 
“Nothing at all shows on my 
board.” 

The thing stopped across the 
sensor ring from Flattery, An 
augur extension jerked away 
from its side, reached toward the 
foam-plugged hole, withdrew. 

“Who’s controlling that thing?” 
Flattery demanded. 

“Not from here,” Prudence 
said. “And I can see both Tim 
and John. They’re not control- 
ling it.” 

“You still getting drain on the 
computer?” Flattery whispered. 

“Yes.” 

“Is the . Ox active?” Flat- 
tery asked. 

“Only the original circuits,” 
Bickel said. “Through the AAT 
bypass. The new doubled units 
haven’t been connected.” 

“There can’t be another Robox 
in that area,” Prudence said. “We 
haven’t put any of the damn’ 
things on automatic. There’s 
nothing showing on my board. 
The remotes would take a day 
and a half at least to . 



“It’s right in front of me,” Flat- 
tery said. 

He watched it, fascinated. A 
tool arm extended with an empty 
sensor socket, reached toward the 
foam-plugged hole, retreated. A 
claw arm came up next. It probed 
the foam, drew back with a swift- 
ness that startled Flattery. 

“What’s it doing?” Prudence 
asked. 

“I’m not sure. It seems to be 
looking over the damage. Its vid- 
eyes are turned toward the hole. 
It acts like it can’t decide which 
tool to use.” 

“What can’t decide?” That was 
Timberlake, his voice faint over 
the Corn-central relay from the 
shop. 

“Try fixing the sensor your- 
self,” Bickel said. 

Flattery swallowed in a dry 
throat. He lifted a feeler with a 
guide eye from the tool pouch 
on his own robox, probed into 
the foam plug looking for the 
leads from the conduit. 

fnstantly a whip-like extension 
A shot out of the other robox, 
trapped his arm, jerked it away. 
The pain in his arm where the 
thing had clamped on it was 
sharp and shocking. He dropped 
the tool, yelled. 

“What’s wrong?” Prudence de- 
manded. 

The whip-like extension slowly 
unwound, released his arm. 



94 



GALAXY 



"The thing grabbed me,” Flat- 
tery said. His voice was shaky 
with pain and surprise. “It used 
its circuit probe . grabbed my 
arm.” 

“It won’t let you make the re- 
pair?” That was Bickel, his voice 
coming in loud over the helmet 
system, indicating he’d plugged 
into the command circuit from 
the shop. 

“Doesn’t look like it will,” Flat- 
tery said. And he wondered : Why 
doesn’t one ot us say what this 
thing has to be? Why 1 re we avoid- 
ing the obvious? 

With an abrupt sense of pur- 
pose, the other robox reached 
out a claw arm, lifted the re- 
placement sensor from Flattery’s 
left hand, matched sensor and 
socket. Another claw arm re- 
covered the feeler guide, fitted 
it to the connections of its own 
circuit probe. 

“What’s it doing now?” Bickel 
asked. 

“Making the repair itself,” 
Flattery said. 

The feeler came out of the hole 
pulling the leads. 

“John, what’s showing on your 
meters?” Prudence asked. 

“A slight pulse from the servo 
banks,” Bickel said. “Very faint. 
It’s like the cycling echo of a 
test pulse. Are you still showing 
current drain in there? I don’t 
have it here.” 

“Drain from the mains into the 



computer,” she said. “You should 
be registering it” 

“Negative,” Bickel said. 

“It just fitted the new socket 
and sensor into the hole,” Flat- 
tery said. 

“It brought the correct spare 
parts?” Bickel asked. 

“It took the sensor I brought,” 
Flattery said. 

“It just took it from you?” 
Prudence asked. 

“That’s right.” 

“Prue, that test pulse is 
stronger,” Bickel said. “Are you 
sure nothing on your board is do- 
ing it?” 

She scanned her console. 
“Nothing.” 

“Job’s finished,” Flattery said. 
“What’s the big board show, 
Prue?” 

“Sensor in service,” she said. 
“I can see you . and it.” 

“Try touching that new sen- 
sor, Raj,” Bickel said. 

“The thing damn’ near took 
my arm out the last time I tried 
that,” Flattery objected. 

“Use a tool,” Bickel said. 
“Something long. You’ve got a 
telescoping radiation probe 
there.” 

Flattery looked into his robox 
unit, removed the telescoping 
probe. He extended it to its limit, 
reached toward the sensor, 
touched it. 

The whip-arm flashed out of 
the other Robox. There came a

95 



jolting shock and Flattery stared 
wide-eyed at the stump of the 
probe in his hand. The severed 
end drifted upward along the 
tube, tumbling from the force of 
fee blow. 

( & TTZ" eeerist!” That was Tim- 

^ berlake, proving they had 
fee shop’s screen switched to 
this circuit and were watching. 

Flattery swallowed, spoke in 
a muffled voice: “If thafd been 
my arm. .” 

He stared at the other robox. 
It sat there, quiescent, its vid- 
eyes pointed toward him. 

We’re playing with fire, Flat- 
tery thought. We don’t know 
whafs guiding that robox. It 
could be a repair program we’ve 
accidentally activated. It could 
be something the Tin Eggs de- 
signers built into the ship. 

“You’d better get out of there, 
Raj,” Prudence said. 

“No, wait!” Bickel said. “Raj, 
don’t move. You hear me?” 

“I hear you,” Flattery said. 
He stared at the robox, realizing 
the thing could cut him in half 
with one blow from that whip- 
ping circuit probe. 

The sound of distant activity 
came through the helmet phones 
to Flattery. 

“I should have the full compu- 
ter showing here,” Bickel said, 
“but I can’t find that damn’ ro- 
box anywhere on my board. 



There’s not even pulse resonance 
in any of the loops to hint at the 
source of control.” 

“I can’t stay out here forever,” 
Flattery whispered hoarsely, his 
mouth dry. 

“What’s showing on the me- 
ters, Prue?” Bickel asked. 

“Still getting computer drain 
. and that pulse.” 

“Raj has been outside the 
shields for sixteen minutes,” 
Timberlake said. “Prue, what’s 
the radiation tolerance level for 
his area?” 

She crossed the comparison 
lines against the time gauge on 
her main board scope, read the 
difference. “He should be back 
inside the shield lock within thir- 
ty-eight minutes.” 

Movement up the tube caught 
Flattery’s attention. The end of 
the radiation probe. It had reach- 
ed the top of its energy curve, 
was beginning to fall back down 
toward the grav center in the 
core of the ship. As the severed 
end of the tool neared the other 
robox, the tip of one of its sen- 
sor arms — just the tip — turned 
to track the passage. 

That minimal activity, that 
watchfulness, filled Flattery with 
greater dread than if the robox 
had attacked the length of tool 
and torn it apart. There was a 
sense of waiting about the thing 
— of waiting and gathering in- 
formation. 



96 



GALAXY 



"Raj.” It was Bickel’s voice. 

"Yes?” 

“Is there any information in 
the computer — even a hint — 
that you might destroy it?” 

Did he send me out here to 
trap me into answering that 
question? Flattery asked him- 
self. But the fear in Bickel’s voice 
ruled out that suggestion. 

“Why?” Flattery asked. 

Bickel aleared his throat. “It 
was programmed to fill in the 
blanks in its information, Raj, 
and I put no limiting factor on 
that. The violence proves it’ll 
stop at nothing to maintain its 
own informational integrity. If 
you pose any threat at all. .” 

“You’re saying it’s conscious?” 
Prue asked. 

“Not the way we’re conscious,” 
Bickel said. “Like an animal. 
Aware. And with at least one 
drive we can recognize: self pre- 
servation.” 

“Raj, answer the question,” 
Prue said. 

She knows the answer. Flat- 
tery thought. He could hear the 
awareness in her voice. Why 
doesn't she answer it for me? 

“The computer may well have 
such information in it,” Flattery 
said. 

And he thought: rm trap- 
ped! I must get back to quarters, 
destroy this thing . it’s already 
out of hand. But if I move, it’ll 
kill me. 



Tie stared at the other robox. 

There was the thing that 
gave the computer mobility — 
the thousands of special-function 
utility robox units throughout the 
ship . even the one under his 
hands — if it were shifted to 
automatic and keyed for pro- 
gram control . and if a con- 
sciousness directed it. These 
were what gave the Ox-cum- 
computer its gonads and ovaries 
— these and the computer- linked 
tools. 

“Would ... it react with vio- 
lence if Raj tried to move?” 
Prudence asked. 

Silence. 

“What about it, Bick?” Tim- 
berlake asked. 

“Very likely,” Bickel said. 
“You saw the violence it used 
when he tried to touch that sen- 
sor.” 

“What would you do if some- 
one poked a finger in your eye?” 
Timberlake asked. 

“It’s approaching me,” Flat- 
tery said, and he felt a flicker 
of pride at how calm his voice 
sounded. 

“Stay put,” Bickel said. “Tim! 
Take a cutting torch and . 

“I’m on my way,” Timberlake 
said. 

“Raj ... I think your only 
hope’s to play dead . remain 
absolutely still,” Bickel said. 

A sensor tip was in front of 
Flattery’s eyes now and he found

97 



himself staring for a second into 
a baleful red and yellow glow. 
The tip retracted, and the robox 
backed off a half a meter. 

“Let go of your own robox,” 
Bickel whispered. 

Flattery saw his own knuckles 
white with the force of their grip 
on the robox control bar. He re- 
laxed the hand. 

“Gravity will set you drifting 
presently back down the tube,” 
Bickel whispered. “Just let it 
happen. Stay limp.” 

The motion was barely percep- 
tible at first. 

“The locks are part of the cen- 
tral system.” That was Prue’s 
voice. “What if they don’t . 

She didn’t finish the question, 
but it was obvious she, too, re- 
membered how the rogue sphinc- 
ter lock had crushed the life out 
of Anderson. 

Nov/, Flattery could see he 
definitely was drifting back. The 
two robox units receded up the 
tube. And that sensor tip re- 
mained pointed at him. 

The first lock passed his eyes. 
It had opened! 

But the lock’s transparent 
leaves remained open after his 
passage and that ambient robox 
was following, hesitantly at first, 
then faster. 

The A A T klaxon blared in 
Flattery’s helmet, transmitted 
through the open net from Corn- 
central. 



“Oh, Jesus!” That was Pru- 
dence. 

“Was the transceiver open?" 
That was Bickel. 

“The message is already into 
the system,” Prudence said. 
“We left it on automatic.” 

“Tim, where are you?” Bickel 
asked. 

“At the hub lock,” Timberlake 
said. 

“Take the message, Prue,” 
Bickel said. “Visio.” 

Relays clicked as she shunted 
the AAT to Com-central. Pre- 
sently, she said : “Short and 

sweet. Hempstead tells us to 
cease ignoring communications. 
We are ordered to turn back and 
make no mistake about it. Odd 
choice of words: ‘This is an arbi- 
trary turn back command.’ ” 

“He knows what he can do 
with his arbitrary turn back 
command,” Bickel said. 

At the sound of Prudence’s 
voice, Flattery had gone cold. 
The chill of ice water gripped 
his chest. ‘ Arbitrary turn back 
command.’ It was the coded or- 
der he had both dreaded and al- 
most longed for — the ‘kill ship’ 
command. 

TT'lattery felt his body knotted 
by frustration. Here he was 
out beyond the shields of the 
core. He had been conditioned 
to accept this order and execute 
it, sacrificing himself for the pro- 



98 



GALAXY 



tection of the race. At this point, 
he couldn’t muddy his mind with 
fanaticism. He knew the dangers 
to the human race from a run- 
away mechanical consciousness 
that nobody could . 

A yell escaped him as some- 
thing grabbed his leg. 

“It’s me, Raj.” 

Timberlake’s voice. It filled 
Flattery’s helmet phones, but he 
took a moment to accept the 
identification emotionally. His 
heart was still hammering as 
Timberlake pulled him past the 
next ring of sensors. 

The nemesis robox increased 
its speed, maintained a distance 
of about three meters. 

“Shall I bum it?” Timberlake 
whispered. 

“Do nothing hostile,” Flattery 
said. 

The edge of the hub chamber 
entered Flattery’s field of vision. 
Timberlake’s hand released Ms 
ankle. Flattery felt the grating 
thump as the hatch to the inner 
lock was opened. 

“In we go,” Timberlake said. 
He gave Flattery a gentle tug as 
they drifted down into the hub 
chamber. 

A lock stanchion came in front 
of Flattery and he grabbed it, 
feeling the inertial pull as he 
checked his motion. That follow- 
ing robox had stopped at the tube 
exit above them, but its sensor 
tip remained pointed at them. 



Timberlake moved in front of 
him, cutting off the view of the 
robox. Flattery backed down 
through the lock’s baffle angle, 
Timberlake following. The hatch 
was closed. Timberlake dogged 
it, tamed. 

Flattery crossed to the other 
hatch, breathing easier now that 
they were behind the shields and 
with a hatch between them and 
that robox. He grabbed the hatch 
dogs, twisted. 

They remained firmly locked. 

He applied more pressure. 

The dogs wouldn’t budge. 

“Come on, let’s go,” Timber- 
lake said. He added Ms hands 
to the effort 

The dogs remained seated as 
though frozen. 

Flattery and Timberlake look- 
ed at each other, their face- 
plates almost touching. Flattery’s 
hands felt slippery with perspira- 
tion inside Ms gloves. He could 
smell the stink of fear within his 
suit. 

“Go . try the other hatch,” 
Flattery said. 

Timberlake nodded, kicked 
back up to the baffle and the 
hatch they had just dogged. Flat- 
tery could see Timberlake’s mus- 
cles lift the shoulders of the suit 
with the effort of trying to re- 
open the other hatch. 

It was obvious the other hatch 
was blocked, too. 

Timberlake dropped back

down beside him, thumbed the 
command circuit switch beneath 
his helmet. “John.” 

“John’s temporarily off the cir- 
cuit,” Prudence said. “You’re out 
of danger . immediate danger?” 
In short, clipped sentences, 
Timberlake reported. 

“Trapped?” she asked. “How 
could you be?” 

“Something’s jammed the 
hatches,” Flattery said. “Why’s 
John off the circuit?” 

“Oh . .” Pause. “He left his 
helmet . down there. He just 
yanked it off, unplugged, grab- 
bed up a bunch of equipment 
and headed for quarters.” 

“Your sensors! Where do they 
show hi*n?” Flattery demanded. 
Silence. 

Then: “In your quarters, Raj. 
I don’t understand.” 

“What’s this equipment he 
took?” Timberlake asked. 

“A whole pile of stuff,” she 
said, “mostly from that bin 
where you were working, Tim, 
under the middle of the bench.” 
In my quarters, Flattery 
thought. Our ‘organ of analysis’ 
didn’t miss a thing! 

“Tim, your torch,” Flattery 
said. He pointed to the cutting 
torch on its tool clip at Timber- 
lake’s waist. 

Timberlake shook his head. 
“A minute ago you were saying 
do nothing hostile.” 

“Give me that torch!” 



“No, sir, Raj. You know what’s 
out there jamming that hatch as 
well as I do. Another robox unit 
or two or four or fifty. You had 
the right idea the first time. Let 
Bickel . .” 

“Don’t you know what Bickel’s 
doing?” Flattery demanded, not 
trying to keep the desperation 
from his voice. 

“Just as well as you do, Raj. 
I assembled most of that gear in 
the center bin according to his 
schematics. It’s a field-effect 
generator synchronized to a shot- 
effect generator. There’s an elec- 
torencephalographic feedback 
unit ... a manamplifier, he calls 
it.” 

“White box-black box,” Flat- 
tery said. “We’ve got to stop 
him.” 

“Why?” 

“He’ll wreck the computer,” 
Flattery said. 

“Not that computer.” 

T)ickel has infected him with 
^ ' this cynicism, Flattery 
thought. And he said: “Then he’ll 
kill himself.” 

“That’s his lookout, but I 
don’t think he will,” Timberlake 
said. 

“When that shot-effect hits 
him, his muscles will break every 
bone in his body!” Flattery said. 
“That’s a hideous way to die.” 

“Maybe if he were connected 
directly to the generator,” Tim- 



100

berlake said. “But he won’t be. 
He’s going to get the shot effect 
through that generator’s field — 
attenuated, buffered.” 

“Do you know what’s in my 
quarters?” Flattery asked. 

“A snooping device of some 
kind,” Timberlake said. “I’ve 
seen the clues on the meters.” 
“A field sorter,” Flattery said. 
“It’s tuned to the computer, 
gated for output. If Bickel takes 
out those gate circuits . .” 

“And he will,” Timberlake 
said. “Now sit down and be quiet. 
It’s our only chance.” 

Flattery glared at him. “If 
Bickel turns that mechanical 
monster loose it could wipe out 
the Earth!” 

“Why don’t you try ghost 
stories for a change?” Timber- 
lake asked. 

“I don’t have time to tell you 
the whole story,” Flattery said. 
“That monster has to be stopped. 
You’ve got to take my word for 
it.” 

“You’re nuts,” Timberlake 
said, but Flattery could see the 
idea had touched the life-systems 
engineer’s deepest inhibitions. 

“You’re an engineer,” Flattery 
said. “You’re a structuralist. You 
know Bickel’s reasoning.” 
“What’re you driving at?” 
“He’s arguing from the inter- 
nal evidence of the human body,” 
Flattery said, speaking with des- 
perate quickness. Timberlake 



had to be made to try to cut 
them out of here! “Structure’s 
vital to the mechanical origins 
— teeth, jaw muscles, digestive 
system and so on. The evidence 
says humans are descended from 
carnivores. And he insists a killer 
instinct is an absolute necessity 
for a carnivore.” 

“Are you saying a killer in- 
stinct is a necessary preliminary 
to consciousness?” 

“Bickel’s saying that! I’m 
not.” 

“Ahhh . you’re making this 
up.” 

“Give me that torch.” 

“No.” Timberlake shook his 
head. 

“I’m going to take that torch 
if I have to kill you to get it,” 
Flattery said. He inched toward 
Timberlake. 

“Prue, did you hear this mad- 
man?” Timberlake asked, back- 
ing one step. 

The command net remained 
silent. 

“Prue?” 

Flattery drew himself up 
straight, his own words replay- 
ing in his mind. “. if I have to 
kill you to get it.” He felt sud- 
denly that he had been herded 
into a completely vulnerable 
corner. 

Killer instinct? he wondered. 

“Prue!” Timberlake called. 
Then: “Raj, snap out of it! Prue 
isn’t answering!” 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



101 



Flattery had stepped back- 
ward. He felt nausea, extreme 
chill, a shaking in the calves of 
his legs and in his shoulders. 
Half-screened thoughts flitted 
about on the edge of his aware- 
ness. 

I’m avoiding something, he 
thought. Hiding my awareness 
from something . that . 
frightens . 

“What’s wrong with you, 
Raj?” Timberlake demanded, 
and there was sudden concern in 
his voice. 

Flattery put out a hand, 
grasped a stanchion to keep him- 
self from collapsing. He closed 
his eyes, conjured up the image 
of the sacred graphic imprinted 
on his cell in quarters — pictur- 
ing against his eyelids the field 
of serenity with its suggestion of 
holy faces and the dynamics of 
the over- printing that combined 
the religious symbols on which 
men had spent their faith and 
yearning. 

They that wait on the Lord 
shall renew their strength. Flat- 
tery told himself. Lord, let this 
strength he transformed in the 
renewal of our minds. Let us 
share thy light. 

The litany hung suspended in 
his consciousness, focused on 
the word “mind” and Flattery’s 
mental image of the sacred gra- 
phic took on motion. The field of 
serenity and sacred symbols dis- 



solved into writhing atoms, drew 
a new pattern like the outline of 
a great river with its watershed. 

F lattery opened his eyes to find 
the interior of this metal trap 
where he stood with Timberlake 
washed in golden light — glar- 
ing, yet soft. 

Timberlake seemed unaware 
of the light, frozen in some pri- 
vate instant. 

And Flattery found himself 
caught by the wonder of that 
revelation — a great river and 
its watershed. 

AH men are parts of the total 
stream, he thought. We are tri- 
butaries — and our minds are 
tributaries, and our most private 
thoughts. Every pattern in the 
universe contributes to the whole 
— some gushing like a freshet 
and some no more than a single 
touch of dew. All structure is an 
expression of the same law. 

The law was like a pulsing 
thread that he could experience 
but not express. Simplicity. He 
felt it in the touch of the suit’s 
fabric against his skin, in the 
awareness of the washed air en- 
tering his lungs, in every sensory 
impression. 

How clean and unique was this 
shower of molecules upon his 
person and this place he occu- 
pied in the dancing pattern. 

“I thank thee, Lord, for this 
enlightenment,” he whispered. 



102 



GALAXY 



And Flattery held himself in 
this supraliminal awareness, 
staring now at Timberlake. Tim- 
berlake appeared to him . , 
somehow dead. He moved, but 
his eyes behind the faceplate 
were like holes in skull sockets. 
Each movement was the stick- 
shaped articulation of a skeleton. 

Remembering Prudence and 
Bickel — Flattery felt they 
shared this deadness: eyes emp- 
ty of life. Their breasts had 
moved with breathing, but the 
labored irregularity of that mo- 
tion contained the same pattern 
(differing only in degree) as the 
breathing of a terminal sickness, 
the breathing of a dying person 
preserved beyond his time by 
artificial means. 

We’re doomed. Flattery 
thought. Lord, why didst Thou 
enlighten me only to show me 
this? 

The skeleton-like Timberlake 
and dead-alive images in his 
memory filled Flattery with rage. 
He pulled himself upright against 
the stanchion, screamed: “You’re 
dead! Zombies! You’re already 
dead!” 

As quickly as the rage had 
come it fled him, and he felt him- 
self crying softly. The feeling of 
enlightenment drained away. It 
had come in the space of ten 
heartbeats and left in the space 
of a single pulse. The golden 
light faded and the plasteel lock 



that trapped him with Timber- 
lake was only that — a room of 
too solid walls, too small, its light 
too' cold, and the air his suit pro- 
vided was too charged with the 
omnipresent stinks of recycling. 

UD aj, you’ve got to control 
^-yourself,” Timberlake said. 

He took a deep breath, feeling 
the tightness in his chest. He felt 
faintly ill, his fear at their help- 
lessness compounded by Flat- 
tery’s near panic. He and Flat- 
tery were as trapped here as that 
cow embryo had been. Timber- 
lake knew it. 

He thought of that helpless 
embryo in the Holstein section 
of the farm stock hyb tanks — ■ 
a bit of protoplasm attached to 
the life system tubes with its own 
special code. It had been a uni- 
que identity, and Timberlake 
felt he had known that partic- 
ular animal — could project its 
lost potential forward in his mind 
to see it grazing and fulfilling its 
natural functions as a producer 
of energy. 

All that natural potential had 
been sacrificed, becoming mere- 
ly units of cerebral excitation in 
the development of a mechanical 
consciousness. Any other func- 
tion or possibility had been lost 
in the instant of its deliberate 
destruction. It had become a 
thing of the senses ■ — unreal, 
receding into the past, its atoms 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



103 



dissipated in the Time void. 
There could be nothing private 
or individual or unique about it 
from that instant of death on- 
ward. 

Timberlake swallowed. His 
throat felt sore as though from 
remembered anguish. He knew 
this feeling was rooted in his 
training as a life systems engineer 
— his inhibitions as a preserver 
of life. He shook his head, trying 
to drive out the sense of confu- 
sion. 

It was an unhorn creature, an 
animal, he told himself. It wasn't 
really a being the way we are 
beings. The physical complexity 
of that dead creature was enor- 
mous, yet it never could have 
been conscious the way we are 
. even if it had lived out its 
normal life. 

“Take it easy, Raj,” Timber- 
lake said. He spoke softly, as 
though soothing a child who had 
been hurt. Then, louder: “Prue?” 

Still no answer. 

She could be too busy to ans- 
wer, Timberlake thought. 

He listened to the gentle bur- 
bling and whirring of his suit, as- 
sessing their position. Prue wasn’t 
answering — reason unknown. 
Bickel had taken off for his quar- 
ters — obviously intent on com- 
pleting the white box-black box 
step in his theory, transferring 
his own pattern of consciousness 
onto the white box that was the 



Ox-cum-computer. Would the 
Ox be like Bickel, then? No . 

Timberlake felt suddenly that 
he had passed beyond some ma- 
jor obstacle in understanding his 
own personal mind-brain rela- 
tionship. He sensed that he had 
entered a new, but as yet uniden- 
tified territory. 

Something Bickel had said 
while they worked on the Ox 
rose up then in Timberlake’s 
mind : 

“If we give this thing life, we 
have to remember that life is a 
constant variable with eccentric 
behavior. The life we create has 
to think in the round as we// as 
in a straight line — even if its 
thinking is derived from patterns 
on tapes and webs of pseudo- 
neurons.” 

The whole form of their prob- 
lem arrayed itself in Timber- 
lake’s mind with the sudden force 
of something thrown at him. 
Problem and solution set them- 
selves up as a physical arrange- 
ment and he saw the nerve nets 
they had built all arrayed as a 
series of triangular faces with a 
moebius twist — prisms of cell- 
triangles interlaced and march- 
ing with their energy flows 
through infinite dimensions, 
forming sense data and memory 
images outside conventional 
space, storing bits and altering re- 
lationships in limitless dimen- 
sional extensions. 



104 



GALAXY 



A moebius twist permitted hu- 
mans to manipulate this infinite 
array in four dimensions. 

It was as though consciousness 
were a valve whose function was 
to simplify. All the complexities 
had to flow through it and be re- 
duced to an orderly alignment. 

Energy flowed into the system 
at all times — enormous amounts 
of energy — sufficient to over- 
load a conventional four-dimen- 
sional system. 

Overload - overload - overload! 
Down it poured through the 
valve of consciousness. As the 
load increased, the valve could 
deflect it . or expand to re- 
ceive it. 

Timberlake felt that he moved 
up through enormous layers of 
fog — layer upon layer upon 
layer — until he reached a place 
of clarity and balance. 

/ am awake , he thought 

XIV 

F lattery’s personal cubby was 
enough like his own to give 
Bickel a sense of familiarity, but 
sufficiently different to fill him 
with disquiet. The life system 
ducts appeared conventional — 
a breather grid with its cap swung 
aside and the tube and mask 
clipped in their racks, the dome 
of repeater gauges above the ac- 
tion couch, atmosphere samplers 
normal. 



The sacred graphic imprinted 
on the bulkhead in front of the 
couch drew his attention. It was 
a compelling thing in pastel 
shades of blue, red and gold with 
a dark and wavy hypnotic over- 
print suggesting faces out of 
dreams. 

Bickel tore his attention from 
the graphic, studied the room’s 
electronic equipment. The cub- 
by’s installations contained a sur- 
prise, and Bickel examined it 
carefully. No doubt about it — 
the thing like a stiffened net that 
swung out over the couch from 
the side bulkhead bed impulses 
to a weaker, but more sophisti- 
cated version of the field genera- 
tor/sorter he had designed for 
the black box-white box trans- 
fer. He traced the leads, found 
another surprise: the thing had 
been gated for oneway opera- 
tion. It impressed its field re- 
flections onto the cubby’s oc- 
cupant, but nothing of the occu- 
pant returned to the ship sys- 
tem. 

Bickel absorbed the implica- 
tions of the device, nodded slow- 
ly- 

Presently, he stretched out on 
the couch, ran a short test on the 
generator, swinging the controls 
close, keeping his eyes on the 
gauges and the half-curve of the 
net-grid which swung down on 
its rack to a position about ten 
centimeters above his head. 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



105 



It took a few seconds for the 
generator’s field to build up, then 
he felt a curious sense of watch- 
fulness — an observing-without- 
emotion. It was like a waking 
dream. He thought immediately 
of reflector. Like a mirror in an 
angle of a hall to reveal people 
around a hidden corner — a one- 
way mirror that revealed only 
that alert watchfulness. 

He saw at once that this in- 
stallation gave a sensitized per- 
son the mood of the ship’s com- 
puter. 

He felt a vague sensation as 
though his viscera had been ex- 
changed for great baths of mer- 
cury, for discs and spools and 
tapes and print drums, that his 
nerve ends had been transmuted 
into thousands of delicate sensors 
reaching into strange dimensions. 

But it was yet a dream. The 
great creature of wires and pseu- 
do-neurons, not fully awake to it- 
self, lay watchful and alert but 
with its full potential still held in 
a rein of somnolence. 

The mood changed. 

Slowly, Bickel felt the field 
gear itself to his reflexes. He felt 
it arming him with a total-in- 
volvement program as though 
drawing a bow to its full capaci- 
ty, marshalling his energies and 
throwing them suddenly into an 
afferent loop. 

With a semi-detached feeling 
of shock, Bickel saw his own right 



hand slam out and open a panel 
concealed by the lines of the re- 
ligious graphic on Flattery’s bulk- 
head. Behind the panel lay a 
trigger, red and ominous. Bickel 
found himself barely able to with- 
hold his hand from that trigger. 
He slapped his left hand against 
the cut-off switch beside the 
couch, felt the generator’s field 
whine down to silence. 

Still his fingers itched to push 
that red trigger. 

He realized then how deeply 
Project had infected this ship 
with self-destruction failsafe de- 
vices. He had been conditioned 
for the job . and doubtless all 
the other crew members, too. 

Then how could I resist the 
conditioning? he wondered. 

The implications filtered slow- 
ly through his awareness and he 
saw that he had been existing 
for days on a threshhold above 
his reflexes, permitting some, in- 
hibiting others — poised and 
waiting. For . something. 

Bickel stared at the red switch. 
That was the ship-killer to which 
Flattery ... to which all of them 
had been wedded. 

S lowly, his palms wet with per- 
spiration, Bickel eased him- 
self off the couch, closed the false 
panel over the switch, began al- 
tering Flattery’s field generator 
installation. The gate circuits 
showed up immediately on the 



106 



GALAXY 



color-coded sheafs. Bickel ripped 
them out, jacked in his own 
amplifier, began installing the 
black box-white box circuitry. 

The work went rapidly: clip- 
in, test: clip-in, test. 

Now, he took the constant-en- 
ergy source : a single plastic- 

sealed block — air-bearing motors 
and spools, edge-coded tapes 
with moebius twists for contin- 
uous-loop operation, a single out- 
put through an Eng multiplier. 
He checked it, saw the strong, 
eccentric pulse on the meter, 
plugged it into the circuitry. 

It was done . ready. 

A deep sense of loneliness 
washed through Bickel then. He 
returned to the couch, stretched 
out on it, opened the command 
circuit transmitter, left the re- 
ceiver dead. 

“Now hear this,” he said, think- 
ing how his voice would roll out 
of the vocoders and shock the 
others to silence. 

“I’ll be starting the white-box 
interchange in just a few sec- 
onds,” Bickel said. “I’ve jammed 
the locks into quarters and my 
receiver’s turned off. Don’t waste 
your time trying to get in here 
or calling me.” 

(Out in their lock trap, Tim- 
berlake turned, peered into Flat- 
tery’s faceplate, saw the terror 
in the man’s eyes.) 

“Everybody sit tight,” Bickel 
said. “Don’t try violence of any 



sort. That killer program’s still 
loose in the circuits. The reason 
I decided to go ahead with this 
. .” he paused, swallowed. “Tim, 
I’m sorry, but I got no response 
from two hyb tank units. I think 
it may’ve killed two colonists the 
way it did with the embryo. It’s 
searching . experimenting . 
curious, like a monkey.” 

(In the lock, Timberlake ex- 
perienced a shortening of breath, 
felt himself sinking back through 
the layers of fog. There was a 
sensation like hunger in his 
stomach. Two colonists killed, 
Oh, God!) 

(In his position beside Timber- 
lake, Flattery clutched a stanch- 
ion, asked himself : Where is 

Prue? He thought of the ship 
hurtling onward with no one at 
the big board . Prue a lifeless 
mass of protoplasm drifting 
somewhere in the control room. 
He closed his eyes, thinking: But 
I’m the ship’s prime target. If it 
kills now, it’ll kill me . to pro- 
tect itself. He opened his eyes, 
stared around the metal walls of 
their trap. No way out. We’ve 
turned on the terrible genie, he 
thought, and we may not be able 
to turn it off. Then: Where is 
Prue?) 

Bickel cleared his throat, said: 
“Use extreme care until I’ve re- 
moved the killer program. Any- 
thing in the ship could be a mur- 
der instrument, do you under- 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



107 



stand? The air we breathe, the 
reclamation systems, robox units, 
any sharp edge with poison on 
it . anything.” 

He depressed the first action 
switch, said: “Count down for 
field build-up starts in thirty 
seconds. Wish me luck.” 

(And Flattery thought: He’s 
committing suicide . but it 
may be a useless gesture.') 

Bickel watched the curve of 
gauges overhead. They registered 
power in the circuits, vocoder on 
and pulsing. A faint hum issued 
from the vocoder. It gave a sud- 
den static burp. 

Needles slammed against pins 
on the monitor dials. 

A rasping came from the vo- 
coder now. Slowly it resolved it- 
self into a gutteral, almost unin- 
telligible voice. 

“To kill,” it said. 

'Oickel studied the meters, saw 
the demand-drain in the 
computer, pulse action in the Ox 
circuits. 

It was the computer speaking 
on its own, all right. 

“To kill,” it repeated, speaking 
more clearly this time. “To ne- 
gate energy, dissolution of sys- 
tems using energy in any form 
. symbolic approximations . 
non-mathematical.” 

Bickel activated a diagnostic 
circuit, read the meters. No en- 
ergy in the command communi- 



cations circuits, pulse in the Ox, 
low energy drain to the com- 
puter. 

To kill. 

He stared at his board, think- 
ing. 

Information conveyed out of a 
tape had an exact mathematical 
equivalent. The tape message 
was at least two messages. Prob- 
ably many more. It was the func- 
tional message, the play of what 
it was supposed to do — supply, 
information, add, subtract, multi- 
ply, solve for an unknown . 
message precisely for a human 
operator according to how much 
information was conveyed. 

Beyond this, Bickel wondered, 
what? 

He knew he had not energized 
the system or imprinted his own 
brand of consciousness on it. Yet, 
the thing acted independently. 
He felt himself on the edge of 
aborting this step, calling in the 
others for consultation . but 
the deadliness of this monster 
remained. To kill. 

Before he could change his 
mind, Bickel depressed the action 
switch on the re-worked field 
generator. He felt it building up 
around him, making his skin 
crawl. Every hair follicle tingled. 
His eyes watered and the backs 
of his hands trembled. He felt 
suspended in a basket of energy. 

Something was fishing for him, 
casting out with a net, dangling 



108 



GALAXY 



hooked lines at him. He knew 
this for the symbol-juggling it 
had to be — the mind trying to 
box a new experience within 
known symbols. 

One of the nets caught him. 
The shot-effect burst hit him 
— an infinity of sparks. 

I t was like an electric shock, 
pungent with reality. He felt 
himself bound up in looped spir- 
als, being towed with an undulat- 
ing rhythm. His entire sensorium 
had become a worm being towed 
through a net ... no: through 
holes and tubes and burrows. He 
felt that valves opened for him 
and closed behind him. It was 
like travelling through the ship’s 
interior access tubes. 

Except that he was a worm 
with every sense concentrated on 
his skin, seeing, breathing, hear- 
ing, feeling through every pore. 
And all the while he was being 
towed down that dizzy spiralling 
with an undulant rhythm. 

Labels began flashing against 
that sensitized skin and he saw 
them with a billion eyes. 

“aural sense data” 

“linear accretion of informa- 
tion” 

“latent addition adjustment” 
“closed-system matching fac- 
tor” 

“16, 000-year memory drop- 
off’ 

“total sense-quality” 



“internal counting mechanism” 

Internal counting mechanism, 
he thought. 

His worm-self grew a pseudo- 
pod, jacked the moebius ener- 
gizer into a flickering board. 

Immediately, he felt the beat 
of it like another heart and the 
labels began flashing past faster 
and faster. 

“psychorelation form-chart” . 
“sense-modality interchange” . 
“form-outline analogue” . “in- 
finite submatrix channel” . 
“sense intensity adjustment” . 
“data overlap network” . “ap- 
proximate similarity comparison” 

The whole pattern of labels and 
valves began to make an odd 
kind of sense to him, a coherence 
within coherence . like a dream 
that had to be interpreted as a 
whole. 

The probability of a sufficient 
number of cells in the computer 
failing at any given moment 
could be given as 16 X 10~ 15 . 
The fact loomed in his aware- 
ness. 16,000-year memory drop- 
off. 

The system in which he found 
himself was such that it had had 
a probability of losing one out of 
every 16,000 memories through 
system malfunction . but clas- 
sification-memory in this context 
meant only a part of an incident. 

Is this system the computer, 
or is it me? he wondered. 

“YOU!” 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



109 



The sound slammed against 
every pore of his sensitized skin 
and he momentarily blanked out. 

As he floated back, something 
whispered : “Synergy.” 

Svnergy, Bickel thought. Co- 
operation in work. Synergy. Co- 
ordination. 

“Human consciousness,” some- 
thing whispered. “Definition too 
broad. Generalized body and 
specialized brain — a relation- 
ship.” 

Past his skin eyes swept a pat- 
tern of interlaced lines, a lacing 
together. It writhed and knotted 
and locked, put out symbols and 
arrows 

A schematic! 

It kept flowing past his aware- 
ness. Cell-net continuities ar- 
ranged as equilateral triangles on 
their contact faces. Bundles of 
parallel circuits tripled, each 
functioning as a nerve net and 
each monitoring the other two 
nets in the tripled circuitry. They 
were grouped in afferent units at 
first. Each cell in a layer of a net 
had an excitatory linkage to each 
of the three synapses on the next 
layer. 

T) ickel felt himself being pushed 
then, herded, compressed. 
He became a single sensor, a vid- 
eye looking down into Corn-cen- 
tral. 

All the action couches were 
empty and Prudence lay 



sprawled across the deck, oae 
arm stretched out toward the 
hatch to quarters. 

With a gestalt burst of aware- 
ness, Bickel realized she was near 
death. Minutes ! This was reaL 
He knew it was real. He was be- 
ing shown through a ship sensor 
a reality within the ship. The big 
console above her empty couch 
winked and flickered. 

Where are Raj and Tim? Bick- 
el asked himself. Is the ship kill- 
ing them, too? 

The view of Com-central 
blanked out. Bickel floated in 
darkness where a voice whisp- 
ered: “Do you wish to be disem- 
bodied?” 

Instant terror was all the an- 
swer he could give. He could not 
locate his muscles or control his 
senses. This must be something 
of what the mental cores exper- 
ienced, he thought. They awak- 
ened to something like this . 
forced to learn new muscles. Am 
I being converted into a bodiless 
brain? 

“The universe has no center,” 
whispered that surrounding voice. 

Darkness so deep It was like a 
total absence of energy envel- 
oped Bickel. 

And silence. 

But I’m conscious, he thought. 

A disembodied consciousness? 
he wondered. That’s impossible. 
There has to be a body. But a 
body brings many problems. 



110 



GALAXY 



Have I become part of the ship’s 
consciousness? 

He sensed breathing. Someone 
was breathing. And heartbeats. 
And muscle tensions. 

Infinite numbers of pinpricks 
on countless nerve ends. 

A bright pulse of light — pain- 
fully bright. 

A diaphanous sensation of re- 
ality seeped through his aware- 
ness. 

Now, he sensed himself re- 
treating, still pounded by that 
multi-dimensional nerve bom- 
bardment. He felt himself pulling 
inward-inward-inward, a struc- 
ture collapsing inward — through 
the sensation-oriented skin 
awareness of a worm-self — in- 
ward-inward. The nerve bom- 
bardment dulled, levelled off, and 
he felt himself to be merely a 
body of flesh and bone cocooned 
in a sleep couch. 

An emotion of terrible loss 
poured through him. It was as 
though he had glimpsed heaven 
and been denied entrance. Tears 
pressed from beneath his eyelids, 
rolled down his cheeks. 

Now, he saw what had hap- 
pened to the Organic Mental 
Cores. 

The human-type brain had 
been prepared genetically for 
manipulating a limited sensory 
input — self -limiting. They had 
thrust these human-type brains 
into a full-on situation, permitted 



them no real unconsciousness, in- 
flicted them with the sensory in- 
put of an organism infinitely 
sensitive and more complex than 
the bodies of which they had 
been deprived. 

The OMCs had tried to adapt, 
had grown heavier conduction 
fibers, added switching capacity 
. but it had not been enough. 
When the necessities of existence 
reached a certain fierce tempo, 
they shorted out their own inter- 
nal connections. They died. 

They had been forced into hy- 
per-consciousness by the press- 
ures of enormous sensory data 
and the lonely knowledge of 
responsibility. They awoke to 
the full potential of being hu- 
mans, but couldn’t be humans 
because they’d been deprived of 
their autonomic emotional reg- 
ister, the organism. The ship had 
no equivalents. 

Prue is near death. 

The thought lifted into his 
mind from some great depth. 

Raj! Where was Raj? 

A flicker of awareness drifted 
through his bruised nervous sys- 
tem. As though through a guaze 
screen, he saw Flattery and Tim- 
berlake trapped in the lock, ro- 
box units holding the hatch dogs 
tightly closed. 

Raj has to get out of there to 
help Prue, he thought. 

He felt the thought go out like 
a free-standing program, feed

through a memory bank auxil- 
iary while it gathered in the nec- 
essary data, become a reflexive 
pulse in control loops. 

The robox at the inner hatch 
whirled the dogs, opened the 
hatch and scurried aside. 

“Raj,” he whispered. “Corn- 
central . quick . Prue . 
help.” 

He sensed the amplified whis- 
per booming out through the 
memory bank and the vocoder 
loops, become a roaring hiss in 
the lock. 

Flattery was already out the 
hatch heading down tube toward 
Corn-central. 

Bickel felt himself fading. His 
awareness was a brilliant point of 



light that grew dimmer and dim- 
mer, changing color as it went. 
It started almost violet, some- 
where around 4,000 angstrom 
units, and traced a continuous 
wave shift until it flickered out 
at the red end. 

In the instant before uncon- 
sciousness, Bickel wondered if he 
could be dying, and he thought: 
Red shift ! Awareness fades like 
the red shift. 

XV 

S omewhere in his own con- 
sciousness, Flattery felt, an 
accumulation of answer-bits had 
poured out of their storage cir- 
cuits, fed into an analyzer 



112

XOWtfTA 6r 



punched for decode and pro- 
duced a terrible answer. 

The ship had to be destroyed 
— and all its occupants with it. 

As the lock hatch swung open, 
that one thought dominated him. 
He hurled himself through the 
hatchway and down the tube. 
Timberlake was close behind. 

“You see that robox?” Tim- 
berlake panted. “What made it 
open up?” 

Flattery sped on without an- 
swering. 

“That voice,” Timberlake said. 
“Was that Bickel, that voice? 
Sounded like Bickel.” 

They were at the Y-branch 
leading down to Com- central 
now, then at the hatch. 



Flattery opened it, slipped 
through. His mind raced. Kill the 
ship now? Destroy this wild ge- 
nie they had created? Timberlake 
mustn’t suspect and try to stop 
me. 

I must act normal, Flattery 
thought. I must wait my moment. 

Prudence lay on the deck half 
way between hatch and couch. 

Flattery knelt beside her, be- 
coming totally physician for the 
necessities of this moment. 

Pulse thin, ragged. Lips cyanic. 
Liver spots at her neck where it 
showed within the edge of the 
helmet seal. He loosed the hinged 
helmet from the back of her neck, 
pressed a hand there. Skin clam- 
my. 



DO 1 WAKE OR DREAM? 



113 




Did she think she was fooling 
me? he wondered. She went off 
the A-S and was experimenting 
on her own body. Medical stores 
showed a gradual depletion of 
serotonin and adrenalin fractions. 

Flattery thought of the neuro- 
reguiatory shifts, the psychic 
aches that would arise from man- 
ipulating body chemistry in this 
fashion. Prue’s moods and 
strange behavior became clearer 
to him. 

He stood up, retrieved the 
emergency medical pack from its 
clips on the bulkhead, saw that 
Timberlake had taken over on 
the big board. 

What difference does it make 
if 1 save her? Flattery asked 
himself. But he returned his at- 
tention once more to the coma- 
tose woman, began ministering 
to her. He kept on checking her 
condition as he worked. No 
broken bones. No evidence of ex- 
ternal injury he could find 
through her suit. 

Timberlake had ignored Pru- 
dence after the first glance. She 
was Flattery’s problem. He had 
darted across to his action couch, 
shifted the big board, keyed first 
for open circuits. 

There was a sense of dullness 
in the equipment. He had to wait 
while servos hummed slowly 
about their work, while circuits 
balked and produced sluggish re- 
sults. 



He could feel his own hairline 
awareness of every control and 
instrument, his consciousness 
keyed up by necessity. The in- 
terrelation of every device in this 
room and throughout the ship 
was like a complicated ballet, a 
pattern growing simpler and 
simpler in his mind even through 
its slowness. 

Timberlake made a delicate 
adjustment in hull-shield con- 
trol, saw the resultant temper- 
ature change register on his in- 
struments as a power shift in the 
radiation-cell accumulators, a 
miniscule shift of weight in the 
ship-as-a-whole brought about by 
adjustment in mass-temperature- 
proton balance. 

But how slow it was. 

And growing slower. 

Timberlake swung his com- 
puter board to his left side, keyed 
for diagnosis, got no response. 

Telltales were winking out on 
the big board. 

With an increasing sense of 
frenzy, Timberlake fought to find 
the trouble. 

Dead circuits. 

No answers. 

Keys on the main console be- 
gan locking. No power in their 
circuits. 

The last light winked out. Ev- 
ery key on the board was locked 
tight, all the servos silent. There 
was no whisper of air circulation 
fans, no pulse of life to be felt in 



114 



GALAXY 



the ship. Slowly, Timberlake 
swung his gaze to the right, star- 
ing at the hyb-tank repeaters. 
The lights were dead, but the 
physical analogue gauges still 
showed feeder fluids flowing in 
the gross duct3 of the system. 

The hyb tank occupants were 
not dead . yet. Whatever the 
settings had been when the board 
went dead, that was the balance 
remaining for each tank. As long 
as the auxiliary accumulators 
throughout the ship retained 
some power. As long as the pump 
motors kept running. 

But the delicate feedback con- 
trol and adjustment was gone. 

tt -nickel's really done it this 
^ time,” he said to Flattery. 
“No power . computer off. Ev- 
erything’s dead.” 

All I need do is wait. Flattery 
thought Without power, the ship 
will die. 

But the effort of reviving Pru- 
dence had softened his determin- 
ation. Living, after all, held its 
attractions — even if they were 
only a ship full of culture-grown 
flesh, duplicates, expendable 
units. 

“ You are humans, never doubt 
that," Hempstead had insisted. 
“What matter that you were 
grown from selected cell cultures 
of select candidates? You are 
still humans — completely. This 
method is merely good common 



sense. We don't want to lose 
our best people if the ship has 
to be destroyed ... as the others 
were.” 

But if the ship died this way, 
it might not leave its capsule rec- 
ord to help the ones who came 
after . the next try. 

“How is she?” Timberlake 
asked, nodded toward Prudence. 

“I think she will recover.” 

“To what?” Timberlake asked. 
Then: “Do you want to go see 
what’s wrong with Bickel?” 

“Why bother?” 

The question with its tone of 
utter submission to fate sent an- 
ger surging through Timberlake. 

“Give up if you want,” he said. 
“But if Bickel’s alive he may 
know what he’s done . and how 
to repair it.” He pushed himself 
away from the couch, headed for 
the hatch to quarters. 

“Wait,” Flattery said. Timber- 
lake’s rejection had stung him 
and he found this surprising. 

Have I acquired a new taste 
for living? Flattery wondered. 
God — what dost Thou want? 

“You keep an eye on Prue,” 
Flattery said. “It was chemical 
shock. She should stay quiet and 
warm. I have her suit heaters 
turned up. Leave them that . .” 

He broke off as the hatch from 
quarters slowly opened. 

Bickel stumbled through it, 
would have fallen had he not 
caught a stanchion. A charred 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



115 



block of plastic slipped from his 
hands, tumbled to the deck. He 
ignored it, clung to the stanchion. 

Flattery studied him. Bickel’s 
eyes looked like two pits with 
dark smudges beneath them. His 
skin was powder white. His 
cheeks showed skull depressions 
as though they had wasted away 
in months of fasting. 

“So your white box didn’t kill 
you,” Flattery said. “Too bad. 
All you did was kill the ship.” 

Bickel shook his head, still un- 
able to speak. 

The stillness of the ship had 
awakened him from a sleep so 
deep he could still feel the fog of 
it clinging to his mind. A pro- 
found weariness dragged at his 
muscles. Movement sent odd 
aches angling through his body, 
stirring this terrible torpor. 

The first thing to catch his at- 
tention as he had awakened had 
been the moebius energizer, his 
clever installation to give the Ox 
a constant source of energy ref- 
erence. A fan of gray char crack- 
led from its broken seals and its 
motors lay silent. The virtually 
frictionless motors and spools, the 
thousand-year units, were blobs 
of fused plastic and metal. 

It had taken several minutes 
for him to gather enough energy 
to move close to the unit and 
study it. His mind had labored 
over the simplest observations — 
charred insulation on the power 



leads and in the timing circuits 
. tape spools twisted out of 
line. 

Slowly, it came to him: some- 
thing had altered the power to 
the motors . and their syn- 
chronization. Something had 
tried to change the timing of this 
pulse . and its intensity. 

Forcing the movement of every 
muscle, he had unplugged the 
unit, stumbled and crawled with 
it back to Corn-central. The dead 
stillness of the ship pressed at 
him as he moved. 

Raj ... Tim .. somebody 
with his mind turned on . has 
to see this, he thought. 

But now that he had made it 
to Com-central, he couldn’t find 
the energy to speak. 

r ]pimberlake recovered the 
fused energizer unit from the 
deck, studied it. 

Flattery crossed to Bickel’s 
side, felt the pulse at his temple, 
lifted an eyelid, looked at his 
lips and tongue. Presently, he 
stooped to the med-kit, removed 
a slapshot and pressed it against 
Bickel’s neck. 

Energy began to bum through 
Bickel’s veins. 

Flattery pressed a squeeze- 
bottle against his lips, said: 
“Here, drink this.” 

Something cool and tingling 
poured down Bickel’s throat 
Flattery removed the bottle. 



116 



GALAXY 



Bickel found a husky half- 
whisper that would serve him as 
voice, rasped: “Tim.” 

Timberlake looked at him. 

Bickel nodded toward the en- 
ergizer, began explaining what 
had happened. 

Flattery interrupted: “Do you 
think the black box-white box 
transfer was completed?” 

Bickel examined the question. 
He could feel his mind clearing 
under the pressure of the stim- 
ulant — and there in his memory 
was the sensation that the ship 
was his body, that he was a crea- 
ture of hard metal and thousands 
of sensors. 

“I . think so,” he said. 

Timberlake held up the block 
of plastic. “But ... it destroyed 
this and . apparently shut it- 
self down.” 

A thought began stirring in 
Bickel’s mind and he said : 
“Could this be a message to us 
... a kind of ultimate message?” 

“God telling us we’ve gone too 
far,” Flattery muttered. 

“No!” Bickel snapped. “The 
Ox telling us . something.” 

“What?” Timberlake asked. 

Bickel tried to wet his lips 
with his tongue. His mouth felt 
so dry. His lips ached. 

“When nature transfers ener- 
gy,” Bickel said, “almost all that 
transfer is unconscious.” He fell 
silent a moment. This was such a 
delicate plane of conceptualiz- 



ing. It had to be handled so 
gently. “But most of the energy 
transfers for all the enormous 
amount of data in the Ox-com- 
puter is routed through master 
programs . and total conscious- 
ness would turn all of them on, 
force the system as a whole to 
suppress some while letting oth- 
ers through. It’d be like riding 
herd on billions of wild animals.” 

“You gave it too much con- 
sciousness?” Timberlake asked. 

Bickel looked at the trans- 
ceiver panel of the Accept and 
Translate system beside his own 
action couch. 

Timberlake turned, followed 
the direction of Bickel’s stare. 

Prudence stirred and moaned. 
Flattery bent to her. She said: 
“Fmmmsh.” 

A lmost automatically, Flattery 
put a hand to her temple, 
checking her pulse. 

She reached up, groping, 
pushed Flattery’s hand away 
from her head. She tried to sit up. 
Flattery helped her. 

“Easy now,” he said. 

She put her hand to her throat. 
How sore her throat felt. She had 
been absorbing the conversation 
around her for several minutes, 
remembering. She remembered 
there had been a train of thought, 
frantic efforts to raise Bickel on 
the intercom and communicate 
with him. She remembered the 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



117 



effort and the urgency, but the 
precise reason for abandoning 
her post and rushing off to tell 
Bickel eluded her questing. 

“We have to weed false infor- 
mation out of our minds,” Bickel 
said. “We’re assuming a totally 
conscious robot, all of its activity 
directed by consciousness. That 
cannot be unless every action is 
monitored simultaneously.” 

His words aroused a vague 
sense of anger in Prudence. He 
kept skirting the What was 
that thought? 

“Would it have the illusion 
that it’s the center of the uni- 
verse?” Timberlake asked. 

“No.” Bickel shook his head, 
remembering: “The universe has 
no center.” That’s what it had 
said to him. 

A moment of intense despair 
overcame him. He felt like 
groaning. 

“Life as we know it,” Timber- 
lake said, “started evolving some 
three thousand million years ago. 
When it got to a certain point, 
then consciousness appeared. Be- 
fore that, there was no conscious- 
ness ... at least in our life form. 
Consciousness comes out of that 
unconscious sea of evolution.” He 
looked at Bickel. “It exists right 
now immersed in that universal 
sea of unconsciousness.” 

As though Timberlake’s words 
had released a dam, Prudence re- 
membered the train of thought so 



urgent it had forced her to aban- 
don her post to go in search of 
Bickel. 

Determinism at work in a sea 
of indeterminism! And she held 
the mathematical key to the 
problem. That was the train of 
thought. She had been trying 
to narrow down a new definition, 
mathematically stated, of quan- 
tum probability. She had sensed 
a three-dimensional grid forming 
in her awareness and a probing 
beam of consciousness focusing 
into that grid. 

Grid, a given volume of space, 
dimensions x.y.z. 

With the source of awareness, 
an invisible object (s) to find in 
time (0 for a given operation 
within that volume. 

Again, she felt that enormous 
increment of consciousness and 
the memory of that sudden 
knowledge — she had pushed her 
body’s chemistry beyond a bal- 
ance point. She remembered how 
the darkness had engulfed her 
just as the mathematical beauty, 
the simplicity of the thought had 
spread itself out in her mind 

ttTohn,” she said, “the Ox 

af isn’t the instrument of con- 
sciousness; it’s the AAT, the 
manipulator of symbols. The Ox 
circuits are merely something 
this manipulator can use to stand 
up tall, to know its own dimen- 
sions. The Ox is the unconscious 



118 



GALAXY 



component. A machine for trans- 
ferring energy.” 

And, still within this height- 
ened awareness, she explained 
the mathematical clues that had 
led her to this point 

“A matrix system,” Bickel said, 
remembering his own plunge into 
this way of attacking the prob- 
lem and the blaze of conscious- 
ness that plunge had whipped up. 
“And sub-matrices and sub-mat- 
rices without end.” 

Flattery stood up, seeing where 
these thoughts must lead, dread- 
ing the moment of action to 
come. He looked down at Pru- 
dence seated on the deck, seeing 
her flushed cheeks, the glitter in 
her eyes. 

“And where does this AAT 
cum Ox stand?” Flattery asked. 
“Have you thought of that?” 
Prudence met his stare, under- 
standing now why their hyb 
tanks had been filled with col- 
onists. “The colonists,” she said, 
nodding. “A field of unconscious- 
ness from which any unconscious 
can draw — a — ground that sus- 
tains and buoys — and the sleep- 
ing colonists provide it.” 

Flattery shook his head feeling 
angry, confused. 

Bickel stared beyond Prue, ab- 
sorbing her words. Ideas merged 
and fitting orders evolved in his 
awareness. This ship had been 
armed, maneuvered, aimed and 
fired. He remembered Hemp- 



stead: gnome- wise face, eyes 

glittering, and that compelling 
voice saying: “What matters is 
the search itself. This is more im- 
portant than the searchers. Con- 
sciousness must dream, it must 
have a dreaming ground — and, 
dreaming, must invoke ever new 
dreams.” 

“Knowledge is pitiless,” Bickel 
said. 

Prudence ignored him, keeping 
her attention on Flattery, aware 
of the psychiatrist- chaplain’s 

confusion. “Don’t you see it, 
Raj?” she asked. “To separate 
subject from object there has 
to be a background of some kind. 
You have to be able to see it 
against something. What’s the 
background for consciousness? 
Unconsciousness.” 

“Zombies,” Bickel said. “Re- 
member, Raj? You called us 
zombies. And why not? We’ve 
existed for most of our lives in 
a state of light hypnosis.” 

Flattery knew Bickel had said 
something, but the words refused 
to link in any understandable 
form. It was as though Bickel 
had said : “Hop limbo promise 
the insect watering class to be 
erected to a first behavior pre- 
serve.” The words trailed off 
through his mind as though they 
had been flashed in front of his 
awareness to screen him from 
something else. 

From what? 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



119 



XVI 

A profound silence filled Com- 
central broken by the sound 
of Prudence shifting her position 
on the deck. 

Bickel felt himself go as calm 
as that silence, as though some 
other self had waited for that 
silence to take the reins. The 
sensation lasted for a single 
heartbeat and expanded into a 
sense of well being, a relaxed 
poise that illuminated every- 
thing around him. It was as if 
one universe had been substitut- 
ed for another, as if a sensory 
amplification of enormous inten- 
sity had been turned on his uni- 
verse. 

He saw the stark unconscious- 
ness in Flattery’s face, in Tim- 
berlake’s — and the semi-con- 

sciousness of Prudence. 

Zombies, he thought. 

“Raj, you called us zombies,” 
Bickel repeated. “If we were 
lightly hypnotized we’d appear 
partially dead to someone in a 
higher state of consciousness.” 

“Do you have to mumble?” 
Timberlake demanded. 

Flattery glared at Bickel. He 
felt that the man was using real 
words that communication was 
intended, but all the meanings 
slipped and slithered through his 
mind without making connection. 

Prudence felt Bickel’s words 
lifting her. 



“Hypnotized,” Bickel said. 
“We accept it as normal because 
it’s virtually the only form of 
consciousness we’ve ever seen. 
You’ve watched the Earth vid- 
eo. You wouldn’t expect an idiot 
to be fooled by the commercials, 
but that rhythmic hammering, 
that repetition . .” 

“Half dead,” Prudence said. 
“Zombies.” 

She said, “Zombies,” Flattery 
thought. Her voice frightened 
him. 

Bickel saw the alertness spread 
through her eyes, the awakening. 

“We should’ve thought of the 
AAT when the thing came alive 
during reception from UMB,” 
Bickel said. 

“You see what has to be 
done?” Prudence asked. “The 
energizer . .” 

“Stimulator,” Bickel said. 

“Stimulator,” she said. “It has 
to be part of the AAT’s input.” 

“Slack lines,” Bickel muttered. 
“Sensory modules interlaced and 
time correlation out of phase. 
Dual function of signal to com- 
pensate for the system’s greatly 
extended spread-out of sense 
data.” 

Timberlake looked from one 
to the other. He felt a sense of 
dullness lifting from his mind. 
Slack lines . sensory modules. 

Symbols! 

Timberlake’s memory shot 
back to their conversation about 



120 



GALAXY 



the energizer. “All the master 
programs dealing with transla- 
tion of symbols are monitored 
through feedback loops linked to 
the A AT.” He heard his own 
voice replaying in his mind. 

Symbols! 

Bickel saw the vitality flowing 
into Timberlake, said: “Think of 
the AAT, Tim. Remember what 
we were saying?” 

Timberlake nodded. The AAT. 
It received hundreds of dupli- 
cates of the same message com- 
pressed into the modulated laser 
burst. It averaged out the blanks 
and distortions, filtered for noise, 
compared for probable meaning 
on the doubtful bits, fed the re- 
sult into a vocoder and produced 
it at an output as intelligible 
sound. 

“It closely approximates what 
we do when we hear someone say 
something to us . then repeat 
it to check if we heard correctly,” 
Timberlake said. 

“You’re all forgetting some- 
thing,” Flattery said. 

They turned, saw Flattery at 
his own action couch, his hand on 
his own repeater console. A single 
red light had come alive there. 

Flattery stared from Bickel to 
Prudence to Timberlake, seeing 
the unnatural brilliance in their 
eyes. Madness! And the deep 
color in their faces, their sense of 
excitement. 

“Raj, wait,” Bickel said. He 



spoke soothingly, watching Flat- 
tery’s hand poised over a key be- 
neath that single red light. 

I should’ve known there’ d be 
another trigger, Bickel thought. 

t4'V7'ou know I have to do this, 

■ John,” Flattery said. And 
he savored the “Ah-hah!” sus- 
pense that charged this moment, 
the electricity in the air like 
ozone. 

‘You have control of the situa- 
tion,” Bickel said. “The least you 
can do is hear what I have to 
say.” 

“We can’t turn it loose,” Flat- 
tery said. 

Timberlake swallowed, glanced 
down at Prudence. How odd, he 
thought, that we should die so 
soon after coming alive. 

“How is it, Raj,” Bickel asked, 
“that we can explain more about 
the unconscious networks of the 
human body than we can about 
the conscious?” 

“You’re wasting time,” Flat- 
tery said. 

“But the thing’s dead,” Bickel 
said. 

“I have to be sure,” Flattery 
said. 

“Raj, you can’t,” Prudence 
said. “Think of all those help- 
less lives down in the hyb tanks. 
Think of . .” 

“Think of all those helpless 
lives back on Earth,” Flattery 
said. “What would we turn loose

on them? John’s black box-white 
box transfer put his life — his en- 
tire ancestry into the computer. 
Don’t you see that? Any of you?” 

Prudence put a hand to her 
mouth. 

Bickel saw alertness in Flat- 
tery, the vital consciousness ex- 
pressed in every movement, re- 
alized the death-conditioning ten- 
sions had pushed him over the 
threshhold into something near 
full potential. But the new argu- 
ment Flattery had produced stag- 
gered Bickel. 

If we restore it .. awaken it 
. I’d be its unconscious, Bickel 
thought. I’d be its emotional 
monitor, its id, its ego and its 
ancestors. He swallowed. And 
Raj . 

“Raj, don’t push that key,” 
Bickel said. 

“I must,” Flattery said. And 
he sensed the poignancy of his 
awareness — this new vitality. 

“You don’t understand,” Bick- 
el said. “That field generator in 
your cubby. You think there was 
no feedback from you into the 
system, but there was. Your 
voice, your prayers — every gross 
or subtle reaction went back into 
the system through its sensors. 
Whatever religion is to you, 
that’s what it’d be to the Ox. 
Whatever . 

“Whatever religion was to me.” 

And he pushed the key. It 
clicked, locked. 



“How long do we have, Raj?” 
Timberlake asked. 

“Perhaps ten minutes,” Flat- 
tery said. 

“And perhaps more,” Bickel 
said. 

“Don’t you think we should’ve 
tried to limp back to UMB?” 
Prudence asked. “Awake as we 
are now, the ship control neces 
sities would’ve been so much 
simpler.” 

“Some fool would be certain 
to play with this ship — just test- 
ing,” Flattery said. “And we 
He gestured to include all four 
of them. “This potential we’ve 
discovered within ourselves 
would’ve been engulfed on earth, 
smothered, killed.” He shrugged. 
“What are a few minutes or a 
few years more or less? I had a 
responsibility . and fulfilled it.” 

“You had a death wish, too,” 
Bickel said. 

“That, too,” Flattery agreed, 
recognizing how the deadly im- 
pulse had helped project him 
into this full awareness. 

With that realization, Flattery 
began to glimpse the train of 
Bickel’s cryptic words — their oth- 
er meaning. 

“There were Greeks who said 
that even the gods must die,” 
Bickel said. 

Flattery turned, looked at the 
big board. It was fully alight 
now, not a warning telltale show- 
ing, every gauge zeroed normal.

"It’s programmed to take us to 
Tau Ceti,” Bickel said. 

TT'lattery began to laugh, al- 
-*■ most hysterically. Present- 
ly, he stopped, said: “But tliere’s 
no inhabitable planet at Tau 
Ceti. You know what all this is, 
John — a set piece. We know 
what we are — cell-culture hu- 
mans! A host gave a bit of him- 
self containing the template of 
the total, and the axolotl tanks 
did the rest. We were expenda- 
bles!” He sighed, put down the 
urge to sink back into the dead- 
ly torpor. “They’re already grow- 
ing our replacements, our dupli- 
cates, building another Tin Egg 
for the next phase of the Project. 
Each failure teaches them some- 
thing back at UMB. They’ve had 
a continuous monitor on the com- 
puter. When I depressed that 
key, that also launched a capsule 
back toward Earth — the com- 
plete report.” 

“Not quite complete,” Bickel 
said. 

“The ship is going to take us to 
Tau Ceti,” Timberlake said. 

“But the selfdestruction pro- 
gram,” Prudence said. And as 
she spoke, she saw what the 
others already had seen. The ship 
held control of its own death. 
It could die. And this was what 
had given it life. The impulse 
welled up into the AAT from 
the Ox circuits . and was re- 



pressed, the way humans re- 
pressed it. The ship had come to 
life the way they had — in the 
midst of death. Death was the 
background against which life 
could know itself. Without death 
— an ending — they were con- 
fronted by the infinite-design 
problem, an impossibility. 

All Flattery had done was to 
provide the AAT — the seat of 
consciousness — with a super en- 
ergizer. 

“Nothing at Tau Ceti, you’re 
sure?” Bickel asked. 

“Planets, but not inhabitable,” 
Flattery said. 

A green action light began to 
glow on the main console. 

“No sense going into hyb,” 
Bickel said. 

“We are happy,” Prudence 
said. She stared at the green light. 
“It isn’t fully conscious yet — 
the ship.” 

“Of course not,” Timberlake 
said, and he thought how deftly 
she had phrased their emotional 
state. I would’ve said we are filled 
with joy. But joy has somewhat 
religious overtones. Prue’s way is 
better. 

Prudence grew aware that 
Flattery was looking at her. 
“Why not?” he said. 

Fes, why not ? she agreed. 

But no woman had ever pre- 
sided at a stranger birth. 

She crossed to the main con- 
sole, switched the computer’s au- 



DO I WAKE OR DREAM? 



123 



dio pickup into the main input 
channel. 

“You,” she said. 

She kept her hand on the 
switch, the new sensitivity of her 
skin reporting the molecular shift 
of metal in direct contact. 

They waited, knowing the out- 
line of what was happening in- 
side their robotic construction. 
That one word, internally power- 
ed by programmed curiosity and 
self-preservation directives, was 
winding its way through the as- 
yet semi-conscious creation. Pres- 
ervation — but there were many 
kinds of preservation, many 
things to preserve. 

But there was only one recep- 
tor upon which “You” could im- 
press itself. 

Programs were firing, new 
cross-links being created, com- 
parisons and balances being 
made. 

Abruptly, the board in front of 
Prue went dead. Every light ex- 
tinguished, every gauge at dead 
rest. She waggled the computer 
switch, got no response. The en- 
tire ship began to tremble. 

“Is that the self-destruction 
program?” Bickel asked. 

A single word, metallic and 
harsh, boomed from the voco- 
der above them: “Negative.” 

r T~'he ship vibration eased, re- 
sumed, cut off sharply. 

There came a weighted sense 



of drifting, a profound silence 
they felt extended throughout the 
ship. 

Again, the vocoder came to 
life, but softer: “Now, you will 
see on your screens a lateral 
view.” 

The overhead screen and the 
fore bulkhead screen came alight 
with the identical scene: a view 
of a solar system, planets picked 
out by the telltale red arrows of 
computer reference. 

“Six planets,” Flattery whisp- 
ered. “Notice the pattern — and 
the sky beyond.” 

“You recognize it?” Timber- 
lake asked. 

“It’s the view the probes 
brought back,” Flattery said. 
“The Tau Ceti system.” 

“Why would it reproduce the 
probe view?” Prudence asked. 

“Prudence,” said the vocoder. 
“This is not a probe view. These 
radiations are what I . see 
now around me.” 

“We’re already at Taa Ceti?” 
Prudence asked. “How can that 
be? We can’t be there 1 ” 

“The symbol there is an inac- 
curacy,” said the vocoder. “ThertB 
and here shift according to a 
polarity dependent upon dimen- 
sion.” 

“But we’re there!” Prudence 
said. 

“A statement erf the obvious 
may be used to remfc*>c* your 
awareness,” the vocoder said. 



124 



GALAXY 



“You were to be conveyed safely 
to Tau Ceti. You have arrived at 
Tau Ceti.” 

“Safely!” Flattery said. 
“There’s no place for us to land.” 
“An inconvenience, no more.” 
Every arrow but one on the 
screen winked out. 

“This planet has been prepar- 
ed for you,” said the vocoder. 

Bickel glanced sideways at 
Flattery, saw the psychiatrist- 
chaplain mopping his brow. 

“Something’s wrong,” Flattery 
whispered. 

“Nothing can be wrong,” the 
vocoder said. “You have but to 
look around you. You are safe.” 
The scene on the screens shift- 
ed. 

“The fourth planet,” said the 
vocoder. “That which is prepared 
can be preserved.” 

Flattery gripped Bickel’s arm. 
“Can’t you hear it?” 

But Bickel was staring at the 
view on the fore screen — a plan- 
et growing larger, filling the 
screen : a green planet with atmo- 
sphere and clouds. 

“How did we get here?” Bick- 
el asked. “Is it possible for me 
to understand?” 

“Your understanding is limit- 
ed,” said the vocoder. “Its sym- 
bols that you have given me pos- 
sess strange variance with non- 
symbolized reality.” 

“But you understand it,” Bick- 
el said. 



nphe vocoder seemed to take 
on a chiding tone: “My un- 
derstanding transcends all pos- 
sibilities of this universe. I do 
not need to know this universe 
because I possess this universe 
as a direct experience.” 

“Can’t you hear it?” Flattery 
demanded. 

Bickel ignored the distraction, 
remembered that moment in the 
force of the field generator when 
he had faltered and fallen back 
from a transcendental awareness. 
He had not possessed the capaci- 
ty. It was a built-in lack. 

He could only accept the ac- 
complished fact because the evi- 
dence was visible on the view- 
screen. They were coming down 
through clouds — a meadow with 
trees beyond it and a snow- 
capped mountain lifted in the 
background. 

“You will find the gravity 
just a fraction less than that of 
Earth,” said the vocoder. “1 am 
now awakening the colonists in 
hybernation. Remain where you 
are until all are awake. You 
must be together when you make 
your decision.” 

His voice rasping in a sudden- 
ly dry throat, Bickel glanced up 
at the vocoder, said: “Decision? 
What decision?” 

“Flattery knows,” said the vo- 
coder. “You must decide how 
you will worship Me.”

PEEPING TOMMY 



Tommy was rich, idle and 
fond of practical jokes. 

Bui he went a bit too fad 



'Tommy Taylor? Oh, he’s com- 
ing along fine. I visited him 
just the other day. Had a long 
talk with him. He’ll be as good 
as new again as soon as they take 
the bandages off. Funny, how an 
expression can be born for the 
wrong reason, and last for cen- 
turies . 

He quit the Club, you know. 
Said he didn’t want any part of 
it any more. As though the Club 



by ROBERT F. YOUNG 



had anything to do with his mis- 
fortune! To tell the truth, we 
were dubious about letting him 
join in the first place. We’re a 
pretty serious bunch, you know, 
us fellows at the Yore. Each of us 
is a specialist in his own right and 
not ordinarily inclined to bend el- 
bows with a layman, even a fil- 
thy-rich layman who can speak 
six different languages. But, as 
Hogglewaite (he specializes in 



Permian rocks) said, time-travel 
costs like hell and we needed the 
money. 

And Tommy didn’t mind. Like 
most playboy-inheritors of late- 
twentieth century family fortun- 
es, he throws $1,000 bills to the 
winds like rain. Oh, we’re going 
to miss him all right The more 
so because, contrary to our ex- 
pectations, he never played a 
single one of his practical jokes 
on us. 

Y ou didn’t know he was a prac- 
tical-joke enthusiast? You can’t 
know very much about him then. 
Some men — like myself, — 
live to tape ancient battles. Some 
men — old Hogglewaite, for 
instance — live to collect Perm- 
ian rocks. And some men — 
yourself, for instance — live to 
pick the brains of people like me 
while we’re on our coffee break 
so they can write technical arti- 
cles for the trade journals. But 
Tommy Taylor lives to play 
practical jokes. Or at least that 
was his purpose in life up until a 
few weeks ago. 

At first, he was content to play 
them on people in the present, 
and then it occurred to him how 
much more fun — and how much 
easier — it would be to play them 
on people in the past. That was 
when he joined the Yore Club 
and took out a two-year lease on 
one of our time-bikes. (The lease 
has another two months.) 



U p until the time this awful 
thing happened to him, he 
was gone most of the time, ped- 
aling back to every age you can 
think of, and playing practical 
jokes on this past person and 
that. I’m not defending him when 
I say that there are far worse 
ways for a man to work off his 
frustrations, and I’m not being 
callous either. No one can do 
anything in the past that, in one 
sense, he hasn’t done already . 
which means that if he hasn’t 
already done it, he won’t, and 
that if he has, he will, whether 
he wants to or not. Tommy was 
merely fulfilling his destiny — 
that’s all. And basically that’s 
all anyone who ever pedals back 
to the past is doing. 

Anyway, most of Tommy’s 
capers were little more than mis- 
chievous pranks, and did no real 
harm to anyone. Take the time 
he went back to Charlestown of 
the night of April 18th, 1775, and 
hid Paul Revere’s horse. Poor 
Paul was half out of his mind 
till he found it, but no perman- 
ent damage was done. He still 
made his historic ride. And then 
there was the time Tommy put 
invisible ink in the Continental 
Congress’ inkwell on the eve of 
the signing of the Declaration of 
Independence. John Hancock 
was fit to be tied — but again, 
no permanent damage was done. 
The ruse was discovered (though 



PEEPING TOMMY 



127 



not its author), the inkwell was 
emptied and refilled, and the his- 
toric document was signed. 

In addition to being a master 
of six languages, Tommy Taylor 
was a master of disguise. If you 
don’t believe it, take a look at 
Brueghel the Elder’s “The Pea- 
sant Wedding” sometime. A good 
reproduction will do. That’s right 
— Tommy’s in it. He’s the musi- 
cian in Red (did I mention he’s 
an accomplished musician — well, 
he is) — the one who has the hun- 
gry look in his eyes and who 
needs a shave. Brueghl recorded 
him perfectly. Photographically, 
almost. Tommy loves to go to 
weddings — or at least he did. 
Weddings provide ideal situa- 
tions for practical jokes. 

Some of his more malicious 
capers, though, I can’t quite go 
along with, even though I realize 
that basically he had no free will 
in any of the things he did. Take 
the innumerable times he told 
Balzac’s creditors where Balzac 
was hiding, for instance. Or the 
time when he intercepted the one 
and only letter that Dante wrote 
to Beatrice (I guess we have 
Tommy to thank for The Divine 
Comedy'). And then there was 
the time he burned Carlyle’s first 
draft of The French Revolution 
after John Stuart Mill finished 
reading it. It was the only copy 
poor Carlyle had, and he had to 
do the whole thing over again 



from memory. Mill blamed his 
housemaid, and so does history; 
but we at the Yore know better. 

Probably the most fiendish 
joke Tommy ever played, though, 
was the one he played on King 
Solomon. On the eve of the 
Queen of Sheba’s arrival in Jeru- 
salem, Tommy got a job in the 
royal kitchen, and everyday for 
the duration of the Queen’s visit 
he slipped six grams of anti-aph- 
rodisiac powder into the king’s 
daily cup of goat’s milk. I im- 
agine it would come as some- 
thing of a shock to Biblical scho- 
lars to know that the Song of 
Songs is nothing more than a 
wish-fulfillment reverie. 

But Tommy’s activities in the 
past weren’t limited to playing 
jokes. Not only was he a practical 
joker, he was also a Peeping 
Tom. 

''“jp he one is a natural outgrowth 
of the other, you see. You 
can be present at the denoue- 
ment of most jokes, but not all of 
them. Some of them you have to 
view from the outside, so to 
speak. 

You’ve probably guessed the 
truth by now, but I’ll unveil it 
anyway: Tommy Taylor was the 
“tailor” who peeped — and got 
blinded for it. But the incident 
didn’t happen quite the way the 
legend would have you believe. 
Legends are about as historically 



128 



GALAXY 



accurate as old Biblical movies. 

Tommy never dreamed the 
Coventry caper would backfire 
on him. The analogy between 
his surname and the occupation 
of the legendary victim failed to 
register on his mind, you see, and 
he took it for granted that he 
and the famous tailor were two 
different people. So, figuring that 
he was immune from harm, he 
costumed himself to conform to 
the period, pedaled back to anci- 
ent Coventry, hid his time-bike, 
and, using his own name, rented 
a room whose single window faced 
the narrowest street in town. 
Then he sat back to wait till 



Lady Godiva came riding by on 
her white horse. When she did, 
he threw open the shutters and 
looked — and she almost clawed 
his eyes out. 

Now wait a minute. Don’t jump 
to conclusions. I didn’t say she 
tried to claw his eyes out because 
he looked. I know as well as you 
do that she probably wanted 
someone to look. But Tommy 
Taylor, remember, was a practi- 
cal joker first and a Peeping 
Tom second. Sure, he looked — 

But he also leaned out the win- 
dow and, with a long pair of bar- 
ber’s shears, cut her hair off.

THE 

GALACTIC GIANTS 



Moons go around the earths 
the earths go 'round the suns 
and all the hosts of suns 
circle a giant sun. 

F. G. Klopstock (1724-1803) 



When the German poet Fried- 
rich Gottlieb Klopstock wrote the 
ode from which these lines are 
taken, he did not indulge in po- 



130 



etic imagination. He just wrote 
down what many astronomers 
and philosophers of his time be- 
lieved to be true. Klopstock’s di- 
rect source was probably Im- 
manuel Kant’s General Natural 
History and Theory of the 
Heavens, published for the first 
time in 1755. 

Immanuel Kant — he happen- 
ed to be born in the same year as 
Klopstock and survived him by 
one year — not only believed in 
a “central sun” of the Milky 
Way, he even thought that we 
could see it in the sky. Kant’s 
candidate for the role of the “cen- 
tral sun” was Sirius, the brightest 
star of the northern sky. Kant’s 
reasoning, as usual, was logical 
and clear. 

Since the Milky Way does not 
have the same width all the way 
around but looks wider in the 
area between Cygnus and Sagit- 
tarius, it follows that our sun is 
not in the center, but is closer to 
this section of the Milky Way. 
Sirius, on the other hand, is in a 
position that could be the center; 
and it is also the brightest star. 
Of course, in order to be the cen- 
tral sun, it would have to be 
larger by far than any other star. 
Shouldn’t this fact be immediate- 
ly apparent to the eye? Kant ex- 
plained why it doesn’t have to be 
so obvious: “even if it (Sirius) 
were 10,000 times as large as our 
sun, the apparent brightness and 



size would be the same if it were 
a hundred times farther away.” 
Since the distance to Sirius, or 
to any other star, was not known 
at the time, nobody could argue 
with the supposition that Sirius 
might be the central sun of the 
Milky Way. 

F or a full century Kant’s opini- 
on was quoted as some- 
thing that was probably correct 
even though it could neither be 
proved nor disproved. But around 
the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury the distance to Sirius had 
been determined — after a few 
corrections — as being only 8.7 
light years. This calculation en- 
abled astronomers to make fairly 
correct guesses about the size of 
Sirius. It was larger than our 
sun, but not much larger, and 
many times as luminous. In short : 
Sirius could not be the central 
sun, but that did not mean that 
there was no central sun. 

By 1880, say, the idea of a 
central sun had been, as some- 
body phrased it, “reluctantly 
abandoned.” Another forty years 
later it became clear that the 
Milky Way galaxy was about six 
times larger than had been as- 
sumed, since the galactic center 
and everything “behind” it — 
from our point of view — is hid- 
den by enormous clouds of cos- 
mic dust and gas. At that mo- 
ment the idea of a central sun 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



131 



could have been revived on the 
grounds that since we cannot see 
the galactic center we cannot say 
whether there is a central sun or 
not. But the general progress of 
astronomical research prevented 
this argument from being uttered. 
It was already clear that certain 
objects in the sky were other 
galaxies and while many of them 
showed a definite nucleus where 
suns are more densely packed 
than in their arms, none showed 
a central sun. 

Nobody is looking for a central 
sun of overwhelming mass and 
gravitational might anymore, but 
a related question is still very 
much alive. Our galaxy is an ag- 
gregation of perhaps 100,000 
million stars of varying sizes. One 
of them must be the largest. 
Which one is it and how large is 
it? 

Slowly now, we cannot answer 
that question because only about 
one sixth of our galaxy can be 
directly observed. Alright then, 
which is the largest star in the 
observable portion of our galaxy? 

Well, yes — now that is an in- 
teresting question. Too bad that 
it cannot be answered without 
first asking a few counter-ques- 
tions. That word “largest” may be 
good enough when it comes to 
light bulbs, cigars or elephants. It 
is not good enough, meaning pre- 
cise enough, when it comes to 
stars. Do you mean the brightest 



star, the one with the greatest 
luminosity? Or do you mean the 
star with the greatest mass, the 
one that would weigh most if it 
could be placed on a scale? Or 
do you mean the star with the 
greatest volume, the one that oc- 
cupies more cubic miles of space 
than any other? These are three 
different classifications and they 
do not go together. 

S ince stars are by definition self- 
luminous objects we’ll look 
for brilliance first. As seen from 
earth, the crown goes to Sirius, 
it sends us more than twice as 
much light as any other star we 
can see. 

But that only means that Sirius 
is the brightest star in our sky, 
it does not mean that it is the 
brightest star in the observable 
portion of the galaxy. It is self- 
evident that a much brighter star 
which is also much farther away 
will look dimmer to our eyes. To 
get rid of the difficulty caused by 
the very considerable differences 
in distances a simplifying con- 
vention had to be introduced. It 
consisted of agreeing on a stand- 
ard distance; the distance chosen 
was ten parsecs or 32.59 light 
years. The magnitude of a star 
is described as if it were that dis- 
tance away, and it is called the 
absolute magnitude. The magni- 
tude that we do see and which 
makes Sirius the brightest star

cupied in 1951. The short line labeled 10 A.U. indicates a distance of 10 astronomical units 
•r 930 million miles. 



in our sky is the apparent magni- 
tude. 

Just to clear up the terminology 
it has to be added that two other 
kinds of magnitude are mentioned 
in astronomical literature. One is 
the visual magnitude which is 
the same as the apparent magni- 
tude for visual observations. But 
stars that radiate a great deal of 
blue and violet light look brighter 
on the photographic plate than 
they do to the eye and here, of 
course, the term photographic 
magnitude is used. 

For our discussion the photo- 
graphic magnitude can be neg- 
lected. We will deal only with 
the “apparent (visual) magni- 
tude” and mainly with the “ab- 
solute magnitude” the visual 
magnitude as it would be if seen 



from a distance of 10 parsecs. If 
you deal with absolute magni- 
tudes only the relative luminosi- 
ties of the stars can be expressed 
simply in terms of the luminosi- 
ty of our sun. A star that is as 
luminous as our sun, no matter 
how faint it looks because of a 
long distance, would be said to 
have the luminosity “1”. 

But let us look at a few ex- 
amples. 

Sirius has a luminosity of 26, 
that is to say that it is 26 times 
as bright as the sun. The near- 
est other star, alpha Centauri 
happens to be a binary, its bright- 
er component, alpha Centauri A 
has a luminosity of 1.1, it is just 
a little brighter than our sun. The 
other component, alpha Centauri 
B, is much dimmer, its luminosi- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



133 



ty is only 0.2, Vega’s luminosity 
is 50, that of Capella is 150, and 
that of Aldebaran is 90. The star 
beta Centauri, second brightest 
star in the constellation of the 
Centaur, has a surprisingly great 
luminosity, namely 3,000; but un- 
like alpha Centauri beta Cen- 
tauri is 300 light years or 91 
parsecs distant. Deneb, about 200 
parsecs away, has a luminosity 
of about 10,000, Rigel, about 166 
parsecs distant, has a luminosity 
of 18,000, and Canopus, 200 par- 
secs away, has a luminosity of 
80,000. If the earth were sudden- 
ly placed in an orbit 100 million 
miles from Canopus, all land life 
on the hemisphere pointing at 
Canopus would be killed, instant- 
ly and the oceans would have 
boiled away before the earth had 
time to rotate once on its axis. 

A close runner-up of Canopus 
is ypsilon Sagittarii. To the 
naked eye it is just a fourth mag- 
nitude star at an estimated dis- 
tance of about 9,000 light years 
or 3,200 parsecs. Its luminosity 
is somewhere between 50,000 and 
70,000 times that of our sun. 
Naturally such estimates cannot 
be precise; we simply cannot 
know how much of the light is 
absorbed by so-called “empty” 
space during a 9,000 year journey. 
It is entirely possible that ypsilon 
Sagittarii has the same luminosi- 
ty as Canopus. At any event 



these two, at the moment, share 
first place as regards true lum- 
inosity among the stars in the ob- 
servable region of our galaxy. 

Though this survey is restricted 
to the one sixth of our own galaxy 
that can be observed visually, one 
exception has to be made. 

Our galaxy has two satellite 
galaxies collectively known as 
the Magellanic Clouds. The larger 
of the Magellanic Clouds contains 
numerous clusters of stars, often 
imbedded in nebulosities. Many 
hot and bright blue- white giants 
of the type of Rigel are present. 
It is generally assumed that 
Rigel type giants are the result 
of a recent “feeding” with cos- 
mic dust due to a passage through 
a dust cloud. Since space inside 
the Greater Magellanic Cloud is 
quite dusty, all this goes together 
quite well. But in a cluster of the 
cloud which is labelled NGC 1910 
there is a supergiant surpassing 
anything that we can see in our 
section of the galaxy. It is the 
star called S Doradus. Because 
of the distance of 160,000 light 
years S Doradus is not visible 
to the naked eye, yet it is the 
must luminous star known. 

It is a variable, with an abso- 
lute luminosity ranging from 8.2 
at minimum to 9.4 at maximum. 
This means that its average 
luminosity is one million times 
that of our sun! If it is a single 
star its diameter might be as 



134 



GALAXY 



large as 200 million miles. But it 
may be a binary. Sergei Gaposch- 
kin has suggested that it might 
be a system of two blue-white 
supergiants eclipsing each other 
during a 40-year period. It has 
also been suggested that S Dora- 
dus was, a comparatively short 
time ago, a double supernova 
which is now fading. 

If S Doradus is a single star 
and if it follows the rules derived 
from our “neighborhood stars”, 
its lifetime, at the present rate 
of energy expenditure, would be 
only 3,000 years. 

As far as the more luminous 
objects that have been dubbed 
“quasars” — a contraction of the 
original designation “quasi-stellar 
objects” — are concerned, I’m go- 
ing to postpone any discussion 
until the time we know some- 
thing about them. 

D etermining the surface tem- 
perature of a star is relative- 
ly easy with modem instrumenta- 
tion. 

Measuring a star’s apparent 
magnitude and calculating its 
true luminosity does not present 
any special difficulties and if all 
these factors are known it is easy 
to calculate the surface area of a 
star and to derive its diameter 
from the surface area. 

But while every star that 
throws radiation into space ad- 
vertises its temperature, composi- 



tion and size, very many star* 
succeed in retaining a secret, 
namely their mass and density. 
As a matter of fact there is no 
way of determining the mass of 
a single star. Only if the star in 
question is a component of a 
binary — or a multiple system 
— can we find its mass by study- 
ing the orbital paths followed by 
the two stars. Of course in quite 
a number of cases close guesses 
can be made. If we have one 
star where the mass could be 
determined because it is a com- 
ponent of a binary and we then 
find another star of the same ab- 
solute magnitude and belonging 
to the same (spectral) class, it 
is reasonable to assume that this 
latter star’s mass will be about 
the same as that of the measured 
star. 

Keeping the restriction in mind 
that, generally speaking, we can 
know only the masses of binaries 
we can now ask about the most 
massive star known. 

The answer is: H.D. 47129 in 
the constellation Monoceros. The 
letters H. D. stand for “Henry 
Draper Catalogue”, published by 
Harvard University during the 
years immediately following the 
first World War. But H.D. 47129 
has a name, too. It is known as 
Plaskett’s Star, after J. S. Plas- 
kett, the director of the Dominion 
Astrophysical Observatory at 
Victoria, British Columbia, who

135 



proved that this star was a bi- 
nary with an orbital period of 14.-1 
days. The combined mass of the 
binary turned out to be 180 times 
the mass of our sun. Both com- 
ponents seem to share this mass 
equally, or very nearly so, so 
that each component of Plas- 
kett’s star has a mass of 90 times 
that of the sun. Both also belong 
to the same spectral type (Os) 
and since the density of stars of 
that spectral type is usually only 
about 10 per cent of the sun’s 
density they must be large in size 
too. 

If Sir Arthur Eddington is 
right, the two components of this 
binary are about as massive as a 
star can be. He found that a star 
of a mass greater than about 100 
solar masses cannot exist. When 
that mass is reached the radiation 
pressure inside the star becomes 
stronger than the gravitational 
forces that hold the star together. 
A star of, say, 150 solar masses 
would be blown apart by its own 
radiation pressure. So far all 
known examples conform to Sir 
Arthur Eddington’s calculation, 
even the largest stars have mass- 
es far below the two heavy- 
weights that form Plaskett’s Star. 

< nd that brings us to the stars 
with the greatest volume, 
collectively known as the Red Gi- 
ants: Algol, Aldebaran and Arc- 
turus. Algol is a binary consisting

of two Red Giants of nearly iden- 
tical mass and size. Their dia- 
meters are 15 times that of the 
sun, but their masses are only 4 
solar masses each. Aldebaran and 
Arcturus are singles with dia- 
meters on the order of 30 solar 
diameters but their estimated 
masses are also just 4 solar 
masses. Antares, Betelgeuse and 
Mira Ceti are classed as Red 
Supergiants; their diameters, ac- 
cording to the late Otto Struve, 
are 300, 400 and 500 solar dia- 
meters. But the mass of Antares 
is estimated as only 10 solar 
masses, Betelgeuse probably 
weighs 15 times as much as our 
sun and Mira Ceti not much 
more. 

But the very largest star of the 
observable portion of our galaxy 
is one that has literally never 



136 



GALAXY 



been seen. It is the supergiant 
epsilon Aurigae, with a diameter 

3.000 times as large as that of 
the sun — which, incidentally, is 

860.000 miles. But if it has never 
been seen, how do we know that 
it exists and on what authority 
can its diameter be given? The 
answer can almost be guessed: 
because it is a component of a 
binary. 

The other component of this 
binary is visible, of course, and 
the designation epsilon Aurigae 
really belongs to this visible com- 
ponent. It was in 1821 when a 
German Lutheran pastor by the 
name of Fritsch, who lived in the 
old city of Quedlinburg, noticed 
that it was a variable star. Not 
realizing that an important dis- 
covery was within grasp he did 
not follow up on his observation 
and it was Friedrich Wilhelm 
Argelander in Bonn who, in 
1848, made good visual observa- 
tions of epsilon Aurigae at mini- 
mum luminosity. It became clear 
that epsilon Aurigae was a so- 
called eclipsing variable, which 
means a star that does not actual- 
ly change its luminosity perio- 
dically as the true variables do. 
The apparent change is due to 
the fact that a less luminous star 
moves in front of its more lumi- 
nous component, thereby making 
it look dimmer. Argelander no- 
ticed two facts: the orbital per- 
iod was unusually long and the 



second component was invisible. 
As for the latter he probably 
thought that later and more 
powerful telescopes would show 
it. 

Other eclipses took place in 
1875, 1902 and 1929, all well ob- 
served. The last eclipse was in 
1955 with the next one due in 
1982. The period is 27.1 years, 
the longest period for an eclipsing 
binary that is known. Even the 
eclipse itself is of impressive 
length; in 1955 it began on June 
5. The light of the visible com- 
ponent diminished steadily for 
192 days and reached its mini- 
mum during the second week of 
December of that year. It then 
stayed at minimum for 330 days 
and needed another 192 days to 
return to normal, a total eclipse 
duration of 714 days, or two years 
minus two weeks and two days. 
But all the time the smaller 
component remains visible, shin- 
ing through the very tenuous 
large star! 

To speak of the luminous 
member of epsilon Aurigae as the 
“smaller component” is justified 
only because the term is used in 
comparison with the larger com- 
ponent. The smaller component is 
itself a supergiant with a dia- 
meter of 250-300 times that of 
the sun and a mass of about 40 
solar masses. 

The mass of the large star, ten 
times the diameter of the smaller

137 



companion, is also about 40 solar 
masses, possibly somewhat less. 
This has the result that the densi- 
ty is the lowest known of any 
star, if you took one million cubic 
miles of it and compressed it in- 
to one cubic mile you would have 
a substance of the same density 
as our air at sea level. The sur- 
face temperature is at best 
1,000° centigrade (1,832° Fahren- 
heit) but probably less. It is too 
cool to be luminous. But, of 
course, at its center the density 
and the temperature must be 
higher. Its core should be lumi- 
nous but we cannot see it; what 
little light there is is drowned 
out by the glare of the bright star. 
The distance to epsilon Aurigae 
can only be estimated, but is be- 
lieved to be on the order of 3,000 
light years. 

I t has often been said that 
thoroughness is the cloak of 
the philosopher and the scientist. 
Without it he feels naked and 
does not like to appear in public. 
Hence a discussion of the galac- 
tic giants would be incomplete 
without at least one quick glance 
at the galactic midgets. 

Just as the question about the 
largest star has more than one 
answer, the question about the 
smallest star does too. And again 
it is a case of whether “small” 
is meant to refer to mass, volume 
or luminosity. 



For years the star L 886-6 in 
Monoceros, discovered by Dr. 
William J. Luyten, was cited as 
being the star with the smallest 
volume. It would need 60,000 
such stars to produce as much 
light as our sun does. The calcu- 
lated diameter is 2,500 miles, only 
about 340 miles more than the 
diameter of our moon. But L 
886-6 is a White Dwarf, its mass 
is 1.4 solar masses and the densi- 
ty of its matter is 55 million 
times the density of water. 

But in 1962 Dr Luyten came 
up with an even smaller White 
Dwarf, LP 327-186 in Taurus 
with a diameter of only about 
1,000 miles. Its density must be 
about four times that of the den- 
sity of L 886-6. 

The faintest star known (not 
a White Dwarf) has a brightness 
of only one millionth that of the 
sun. It is a companion to another 
faint star, registered as B.D. + 4° 
4048 1 . It was discovered by Dr. 
G. Van Biesbroek and was found 
to have an absolute magnitude 
of 19 in red light, three magni- 
tudes fainter than the oft quoted 
faint star Wolf 359. 

The lightest known star was 
announced by Dr. Peter van de 
Camp in 1944. Its designation is 
Ross 614-B, its absolute magni- 
tude is 17, its liwninosity is only

The Original Inventor of Recording Tape. 

S everal years ago I devoted a 
section of my column to a 
discussion of the fact that all the 
materials needed for building a 
large liquid fuel rocket existed in 
1906. I also pointed out that most 
of the sub-assemblies, such as 
centrifugal pumps, pressure bot- 
tles for gas with which to run 
gyroscopes and so forth were in 
existence at the time. 

Even the idea of large liquid 
fuel rockets had been voiced at 
the time. What was missing was 
a synthesis of the existing pieces 
of knowledge and hardware. 

Last year I repeated the story 
during a lecture to an engineer- 
ing society in the Los Angeles 
area and during the social hour 
that followed the lecture more 
Ilian one engineer, engaged in 
space work, let out thoughtful 
moans which could be vocalized 
as: “What do we have now that 
could be put together for some- 
thing revolutionary if only some- 
body had the necessary vision for 
a synthesis?” 

1 regret sincerely that I can- 
not answer this question — if I 
could I’d get myself a few patents 
and tell industry to negotiate 
with my attorney. But I can tell 



a story that illustrates the op- 
posite case, that of a man who 
had vision and the right idea but 
who could not do anything with 
it because a needed invention or 
two had not yet been made. Hi* 
name was Oberlin Smith and he 
should be regarded as the original 
inventor of recording tape, use- 
ful from kindergarten to orbiting 
satellites. 

The original publication by 
Oberlin Smith took place in the 
long defunct journel The Electri- 
cal World, issue of September 8, 
1888. His opening paragraph 
read: “There being nowadays 

throughout the scientific world 
great activity of thought regard- 
ing listening and talking ma- 
chines (both Alexander Graham 
Bell and Thomas Alva Edison 
had obtained their patents for 
the telephone and for the phono- 
graph about a decade earlier, in 
1877) the readers of The Electri- 
cal World may be interested in 
a description of two or three pos- 
sible methods of making a phono- 
graph which the writer contrived 
some years ago, but which were 
laid aside and never brought to 
completion on account of a pres* 
of other work.” 

The first of Smith’s suggestions 
was a possible improvement erf 
Edison’s phonograph by inscrib- 
ing the sound not on tinfoil (as 
Edison did) but on a “thin rib- 
bon of iron, steel or other sub- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



13 * 



stance capable of being tempo- 
rarily softened by heat.” The rib- 
bon was to have a width of about 
l/30 th of an inch and a probable 
thickness of l/200 th of an inch. 
The idea was to soften the ribbon 
by a heat lamp just before it 
reached the inscribing needle and 
to have the distance between re- 
cording needle and receiving reel 
long enough so that the ribbon 
would be hard again when wound 
on the reel. Looking back at this 
suggestion from the vantage point 
provided by the three quarters 
of a century that have passed, 
one can say that this probably 
would not have worked out well 
with a metallic ribbon but that 
Mr. Smith might have been quite 
successful if thermo-setting plas- 
tics (or even ordinary thermo- 
plastics) had existed in his time. 

T)ut it is the next suggestion 
-*-* that makes Oberlin Smith 
the original inventor of the re- 
cording tape. He proceeded to 
point out that an “all-electric 
method” is likely to be superior 
to a mechanical method. He 
wanted to pass a “cord” through 
a coil connected with a micro- 
phone so that “the cord becomes, 
so to speak, a series of short mag- 
nets grouped into alternate swell- 
ings and attenuations of magne- 
tism.” 

“The cord,” he continued, 
“therefore contains a perfect rec- 



ord of the sound, far more deli- 
cate than the indentations in the 
tinfoil of the mechanical phono- 
graph. The probable construction 
of the cord would be a cotton, 
silk or other thread, among whose 
fibres would be spun (or other- 
wise mixed) hard steel dust, or 
short clippings of very fine steel 
wire, hardened. Each piece 
would, of course, became a 
complete magnet. Other forms 
of the cord might be a brass, 
lead or other wire or rib- 
bon through which the steel 
dust was mixed in melting, 
being hardened afterwards in the 
case of brass or any metal with 
a high melting point. Another 
(but too expensive), form would 
be a chain with each link a mag- 
net; or, if the magnets affected 
each other too much when in 
contact, each alternate link could 
be of non-magnetic material.” 
Oberlin Smith did not think 
that the idea of a chain, already 
discarded because of its probable 
high price, was as good as the 
idea of dust magnets imbedded 
in a thread or ribbon of non- 
metallic material. And he men- 
tioned, but discarded, the idea 
that it might be possible to use 
just a steel wire, because he 
doubted that the steel wire 
“would divide itself up properly 
into a number of short magnets. 
The magnetic influence would be 
distributed along the wire in a 



140 



GALAXY 



most totally depraved way, with 
nodal points just where they were 
not wanted.” 

The reason why Smith did not 
follow up on his own ideas was 
not just the “press of other work” 
as he had cited in the beginning. 
He had run into too many prac- 
tical difficulties. He had develop- 
ed a machine for spinning dust 
into a cotton thread, but had been 
unable to harden steel dust be- 
cause of oxidation taking place 
in the process. He had chopped 
up steel wire and found that a 
piece of wire had to be three or 
four times as long as its dia- 
meter, or else the small pieces 
would not become magnets, at 
least in his own experiments. He 
had tried to find information on 
very small magnets in contempo- 
rary books, but such information 
either did not exist, or else it had 
not been published in English. 
He had approached other re- 
searchers with his problem, ad- 
mitting his ignorance, but “had 
found an equal amount of ignor- 
ance in several well-known elec- 
tricians.” 

\ gain, from the vantage point 
of three quarters of a cen- 
tury later, it is easy to see what 
went wrong. Oberlin Smith had 
what he considered to be an in- 
teresting and possibly workable 
idea. But it was far more than 
that, it was a project that would 



require an extensive research 
program of several thousand sci- 
entific man hours. Realizing this 
to some extent, he had decided 
to publish his ideas, “hoping that 
some of the numerous experimen 
ters now working in this field 
may find a germ of good from 
which something useful may 
grow.” 

The other experimenters did 
not pay any known attention to 
Smith’s “germ”, either because 
they realized the magnitude of 
the job to be done or — more 
probable — because they were 
busy with projects of their own. 

The first man who actually 
built a recording device along 
the lines suggested by Smith was 
the Danish inventor Valdemar 
Poulson who probably never saw 
Smith’s article. One of the rea- 
sons for saying so is that Poulson 
did use a steel wire. His instru- 
ment was called the “Telegraph- 
on” and it was one of the many 
attractions of the Paris Exposi- 
tion of 1900. Among the impor- 
tant men of the time who listen- 
ed to the inventor’s explanation 
was old Emperor Franz Josef of 
Austria who then said into the 
microphone : “This new invention 
is most interesting to me and 
thank you very much for its 
demonstration,” — and then 
listened to his own voice. In all 
probability Franz Josef was as 
surprised at the sound of his own

141 



voice as everybody else who 
hears it for the first time. But in 
spite of its public success at the 
Exposition the “Telegraphon” re- 
mained a one-time attempt, pos- 
sibly because the phonograph 
was reasonably well established. 

Well, where and when did the 
recording tape of today begin? 
It began with the German patent 
No. 500,900, granted to one Fritz 
Pfleumer of Dresden in 1928 who 
claimed the invention of record- 
ing sound on paper ticker tape 
that had been covered with iron 
dust. He actually built an ap- 
paratus for demonstration, but 
the first results were hardly ac- 
ceptable. He offered his inven- 
tion, among others, to the A.E.G. 
(Allgemeine Electricitats-Gesel- 
lschaft), the German counterpart 
of General Electric. The research 
chiefs of the A.E.G. reacted pre- 
cisely as Oberlin Smith had 
hoped his contemporaries would 
react. They decided that this was 
a useful idea, but totally useless 
without lots of developmental 
work. 

One of the things that Mr. 
Pfleumer’s tape did was to pro- 
duce cracking noises at random 
intervals. They were finally trac- 
ed to almost miscroscopic holes 
in the paper tape. Paper man- 
ufacturers had never been ask- 
ed to produce thin paper that 
did not have miscroscopic holes 
and when confronted with such a 



request said two things: (1) that 
thin paper apparently was bound 
to have such holes and that 
there was nothing they could do 
about it; (2) if the elimination 
of such holes was so important, 
why didn’t A.E.G. glue two tapes 
together? Each tape would have 
holes, but that the holes would 
match was most unlikely. 

Of course that was correct, but 
paper tape just was not strong 
enough and A.E.G. threw the 
project into the lap of a chemical 
plant in Ludwigshafen: “Find 
something that behaves like pa- 
per in every physical aspect but 
is stronger and, if possible, fire- 
proof.” That was the request. The 
chemists of the company felt that 
the final request — namely that 
the tape should be fireproof — 
was unreasonable. They ignored 
it and, in 1932, began to experi- 
ment with tapes of cellulose ace- 
tate. Two years later they had 
something that could be publicly 
demonstrated, the occasion was a 
Radio Exposition in Berlin in 
1934. By 1939 the factory pro- 
duced over 16 million feet of rec- 
ording tape. 

Ten years after the first pub- 
lic demonstration a new material 
was found, namely polyvinylch- 
loride. And that was the record- 
ing tape we now know, based on 
a principle Oberlin Smith had 
thought up back in 1888.

A /Tiss Appleton, secretary and 
receptionist to the firm of 
Doublas, Rogan and Stretch, 
Consultants, was leaning back in 
her chair behind the desk in the 
outer office, polishing her bright 
red nails when the door to the 



broom closet opened and a man 
stepped out. Adjusting his purple 
and yellow zebra-striped suit, he 
strode to the desk and leered at 
Miss Appleton. She hurriedly sat 
up in the chair and pulled down 
her skirt. 



143 



“Yes?” she almost stammered. 

“State my business,” the man 
demanded. 

Miss Appleton recoiled. 
“What?” 

“State my business,” the man 
in the zebra-striped suit declared, 
“I must.” 

“You just came out of the 
broom closet,” Miss Appleton 
said firmly. 

“Very interesting,” the zebra- 
man affirmed. 

“But there wasn’t anyone in 
the broom closet,” Miss Appleton 
said, trying not to scream. 

“Not before,” the man con- 
firmed, “after.” 

“What?” Miss Appleton said, 
repeating herself. 

“Of course,” the man said. “Ob- 
vious. Wrong tense. Not in be- 
fore. In after. I,” he announced 
proudly, “am forty-four.” 

“Oh,” Miss Appleton said 
weakly. “Very interesting.” 

“Now round bluebird conversa- 
tion developing is,” the zebra- 
striped man informed her. “State 
my business I must. Of impor- 
tance to your firmly is. Of 
course. I am forty-four. Accred- 
ited representative.” 

Miss Appleton fought down a 
rising wave of hysteria. Doublas, 
Rogan and Stretch, she reminded 
herself, did not employ her be- 
cause of her beauty alone. Her in- 
telligence and common sense, as 
Mister Stretch had told her in his

apartment, were important assets 
of the firm. Valuable business 
had been brought in by a lot of 
very peculiar people. Her job 
was to pacify them; not to reason 
why, or how they had come out 
of the broom closet. 

“Whom do you wish to see?” 
she asked, with her sweetest 
smile. 

“Ah, better is. Down to busi- 
ness we getting are. Proper per- 
son you must direct me to. I am 
representative (accredited), you 
are consultant. I am forty-four, 
you twenty-three are.” 

“Twenty-two,” Miss Appleton 
corrected without thinking. 

“For sure?” The man looked 
surprised. “Of no great impor- 
tance is, but shocking mechanism 
error.” 

Miss Appleton was losing the 
thread of the conversation. She 
fell back on: “Whom did you say 
you wished to talk to?” 

“He who can help me, my posi- 
tion considering.”

“Give me your name, and I’ll see 
if Mr. Stretch will see you.” 
“Done,” the zebra-man said 
gaily. “My name yours is.” He 
made a grandiloquent gesture. 

“Yes,” she said desperately, 
“but what is the name?” 

“Ah,” zebra-stripe said, 
“Shakespeare. Famous quotation 
is. How fine that attracting wom- 
an like you should also so intel- 
ligent be.” He pulled a small 
white rectangle from a pocket in 
his sleeve and handed it to her. 
It was a business card. Praz, it 
said, Accredited Representative, 
Moibly Cre., Traders Down the 
Years. In the lower right hand 
corner of the card it said 44th. 

Miss Appleton picked up the 
phone and pressed the inter-of- 
fice buzzer. “Mister Stretch? 
There’s a Mister Praz out here to

“Cre.,” she said into the phone. 
“What’s that?” Stretch’s hoarse 
voice came over the wire. “Well, 
look here, Cinderella, keep him 
out there ’till I get my tie on. I’ll 
buzz you in a minute, then send 
him in.” 

“Y t:s, sir.” She hung up. “Mis- 
ter Stretch will see you in a min- 
ute,” she informed Praz. 

“Fine is,” he said. He started 
advancing around the desk. “Now 
time for gathering rosebuds in 
May is. Historical quotation of 



great age.” He lunged. Miss Ap- 
pleton ducked. The chair shot 
out from under her and sped 
across the room, leaving Miss 
Appleton on the floor. Praz set- 
tled on top of her. “Veritable 
rosebud,” he murmured in her 
ear. He kissed her passionately. 
She tried to push him away, and 
idiotically found herself thinking 
that his suit felt very warm to 
the touch. He kissed her again. 
He seems to have had a lot of 
practice, she reflected. The buzz- 
er sounded. 

“Mister Stretch will see you 
now,” she said. 

“Ah,” he said, jumping up. 
“Business is. I shall return. 
Quotation.” He slid something 
out of an inside pocket and put 
it on the desk. “Present for you 
is,” he said. 

Miss Appleton got up off the 
floor and smoothed her skirt. She 
looked at the object on the desk. 
It looked like an engraved ivory 
box for a long harmonica. 

“For you,” Praz said, “Martian 
Dream is.” He opened the door 
to the inner office, and went in- 
side. Miss Appleton leaned over 
the box and opened it. A thin 
stream of water hit her in the 
nose. 

G eorge Stretch had been 
schooled for many years in 
the art of keeping his face ex- 
pressionless. If the diagonal

purple and yellow striping of his 
visitor’s suit startled him, he 
didn’t show it. As Praz ap- 
proached the desk, he stood up 
and extended his hand. “Mister 
Praz,” he said, “welcome.” 

Praz examined the outstretched 
arm critically. “Why you bite 
your nails do?” he asked. 

Stretch jerked his arm back 
as if it were confronted by a 
scorpion about to strike. “Ha 
ha,” he said, “hum.” He sat down. 
Indicating a chair by his desk, he 
said, “Take a seat.” 

“Do not wish,” his visitor told 
him, “however, will borrow.” 
Praz dropped into the indicated 
chair. “You business consultant 
are?” he asked. 

“That’s what our card says.” 
“Interesting. You able to 
handle and spread new produce 
are?” 

Stretch leaned back in his 
chair. “Well now, that’s not our 
usual line, but I’m sure some- 
thing can be worked out.” 

“Of excellence is.” Praz took 
what looked like a handle from 
his jacket pocket. He shook it, 
and a large briefcase descended 
from it, and remained attached. 
“Uew produce to show you.” 
Stretch kept a very tight grip 
on the sides of his chair, and 
worked at keeping his face ex- 
pressionless. He almost succeed- 
ed “Where,” he grated, “where 
are you from?” 



Praz saw Stretch staring at the 
case, and understood. “Of sorrow 
am,” he said, “of apologies. You 
not told were. Of course. I am 
forty-four.” 

“I don’t care how old you are; 
how did you do that trick with 
the briefcase?” 

“Illumination comes. Semantic 
difficulty is. Forty-four not years 
of age, it century. I temporal rep- 
resentative of firmly in forty- 
fourth numbered century am.” 
“You mean, you’re from the 
future?” 

“I mean that.” 

Stretch stopped to think. He 
prided himself on his ability to 
adjust to unfamiliar situations, 
but he also prided himself on his 
ability to avoid being hoaxed. 
“That would explain the brief- 
case,” he said. “But, before we 
settle down to business, can you 
offer any further proof?” 

“Ah! You afraid that I a con- 
fidential man might be are.” 
Stretch sorted the sentence out. 
“That’s right,” he admitted. 

“Attached-case not sufficient 
proof. Of course. Contents of case, 
however, should convincing be.” 
“Attached-case?” 

“To handle,” Praz explained. 
He laid the case on the desk and 
opened it. It was divided into a 
number of closed compartments. 
“I show you varied produce, and, 
at same time, convince you of 
genuineness of self will.” He 



146 



GALAXY 



opened the first compartment, 
and took out a small silver disk. 
“Matter duplicator is,” he an- 
nounced. 

U A matter duplicator? That 
would convince me.” 
Stretch squinted at the tiny ob- 
ject glittering in Praz’s hand and 
then fished in his wallet for a dol- 
lar bill. “Here,” he said, extend- 
ing it, “let’s see you duplicate 
this.” 

“Unable,” Praz said, not taking 
the bill. “Disk only duplicate pat- 
tern imposed in manufacture 
will.” 

“Oh,” Stretch said. “Well, what 
does this one duplicate?” 

“Small pastries,” Praz told him, 
“in shapes of various animals. He 
shook the disk, grabbing the small 
object that came out, and hand- 
ed it to Stretch. “Taste,” he said. 

Stretch examined the object. It 
was a small, perfectly formed 
goose, with its wings outstretched 
as though in flight. He weighed 
it tentatively in his hand and 
then bit off the right wing. “Ani- 
mal crackers,” he said, munching 
on the morsel, “but good, very 
good.” 

When Stretch finished the 
goose, Praz shook another object 
out of the disk and handed it 
over. Stretch took it, but almost 
dropped it when he got a close 
look. The beast reproduced in 
miniature exceeded in horror of 



appearance the best attempts of 
the Hollywood monster-makers. 
Vicious claws terminated each of 
the monster’s six arms; long, 
curved fangs protruded from the 
obscenely grinning mouth; and 
tentacles grouped about the head 
like a nightmare Medusa. 

“What on Earth is that?” 
Stretch demanded. 

“Not of Earth,” Praz explained. 
“Andromeda from. Intelligent in- 
digenous life form is. Excellent 
pets for pre-school children 
makes.” 

“Oh.” Stretch carefully put the 
beast aside. “What other products 
do you have to show me?” 

“Matter duplicator not great 
success is? Perhaps this more im- 
pressive will be.” Praz removed a 
small black object from another 
compartment in his attached-case 
and threw it in the general direc- 
tion of the wall. It landed, clung 
for a second, and then scuttled 
into a corner near the ceiling. 

Stretch glared at the formless 
object. It glared back with one 
small red eye. “What is it?” 
Stretch asked, averting his gaze. 

“Fire extincter is. Autonomous. 
If you flint-and-steel have, I 
demonstrate.” 

Stretch pulled out his lighter 
and handed it to Praz, who ex- 
amined it intently for a minute 
and then, with a twist of his fin- 
ger, released the spring that held 
the flint in. The spring went

147 



bouncing around the room, and 
Praz dived after it yelling what 
sounded like “up beast!” 

Praz retrieved the spring from 
under the desk and stood up. He 
started pulling the cotton stuffing 
out of the lighter and arranging 
it in a little mound of tufts on one 
corner of the desk. 

Stretch controlled himself. 
“What are you doing?” he yelled 
softly. 

“Preparing kindling, starting 
fire for.” 

“Won’t a match do?” 

“Match?” 

“Yes, match.” Stretch pulled a 
pack of matches out of his pocket 
and struck one in demonstration. 
The shapeless black beast on the 
wall scurried over to a point near 
the match, and neatly spat a 
white powder on it. The match 
went out. 

“Will do,” Praz chortled, “did.” 
He put down the lighter. 

S tretch looked down at his hand, 
where flakes of the white pow- 
der had settled on his fingers 
around the match. “It burns,” he 
said. 

“No,” Praz said, “it out is.” 
“Not the match, my hand. That 
powder is burning my hand.” 
“Put match down,” Praz said, 
“and hands wash. Powder solu- 
able in water is.” 

Stretch dropped the match 
and, with his hands held before 



him like a surgeon’s waiting for 
the rubber gloves, he fled into his 
private washroom in the rear erf 
his office. 

After a minute he emerged 
from the washroom rubbing a 
coating of burn ointment into his 
hands. “I don’t know,” he said, 
looking at Praz, “whether the 
twentieth century is ready for 
you yet.” 

Praz looked startled. “You 
pleased to joke are,” he said. 

“About what?” 

“Century. Twenty-two is, yes? 
Not twenty?” 

“Now, why would I joke about 
a thing like that? Everyone 
knows what year . oh.” Keep- 
ing his newly greased hands 
well away from the red leather 
of the desk top, Stretch gingerly 
sat down. “You’re serious.” 

“Serious am,” confirmed Praz. 

Stretch turned the desk calen- 
dar around to face Praz. “There,” 
he said, “see for yourself. April 
fifteenth, 1965. That’s A.D., of 
course.” 

Praz jumped up and hastily 
closed the attached-case. “Ser- 
ious mistake been made has,” he 
said. He shook the handle, and 
the case rose and disappeared 
into the black handgrip. 

Stretch no longer doubted the 
authenticity of the gentleman 
standing before him. He rallied 
all of his powers of persuasion. 
“You mean the authorities don’t

permit you to sell in this . 
time?” he asked, ready to point 
out the mutual advantages of 
some sort of blackmarket activi- 
ties. 

“Not question of permitting 
is,” Praz said. “Question of pos- 
sibility is. Time travel like travel 
in car suspended between two 
mountains is. Both sending and 
receiving stations exist must be- 
fore travel between them possi- 
ble becomes.” 

“Oh,” Stretch pondered over 
the answer. “So you can’t travel 
back to any earlier than when 
the first machine was invented?” 

“Right is. And first machine 
not invented until twenty-two in 
number of centuries was.” 

“But then, how did you . 
what are you doing here?” 

“One explanation possible is,” 
Praz said, pocketing the animal- 
cracker producer, “abortive ex- 
periment in mid twenty number 
century. Professor of name like 
Blatsky at Water Edge Institute 
father of time travel became un- 
knowingly when he produce tra- 
vel field for two hours. Building 
blown up when he attempt to 
turn off machine was. I inadvert- 
ently tuned to his projection be- 
came must have.” Praz glanced 
at the fire extincter hugging the 
wall, decided against wasting the 
time necessary to retrieve it, and 
hurried from the office. Stretch 
ran after him. 



4 4 T ook, why don’t we . he 
started. 

“No time.” Praz trotted across 
the room, and entered the broom 
closet, slamming the door behind 
him. Stretch ran to the broom 
closet and threw open the door. 
It was empty. 

“Miss Appleton,” Stretch yell- 
ed, turning around. Miss Apple- 
ton didn’t answer. She was sit- 
ting at her desk in what appeared 
to be a hypnotic state, staring at 
a varicolored stream of water 
which jumped and danced across 
the top of a long, thin ivory box 
on top of her desk. 

Stretch ran across the room to 
the table which held the phone 
book. 

There was no Water Edge In- 
stitute listed. Something nudg- 
ed at the corner of Stretch’s 
memory. He checked. There was 
a Seaside Institute right outside 
of town. Stretch dialed their num- 
ber. 

“Seaside Institute, good af- 
ternoon.” 

“Good afternoon. Have you a 
Professor Blatsky at the Insti- 
tute?” 

“Professor Blatsky? He’s in 
his laboratory at the moment. 
Would you like to be connected 
with him?” 

“I would very much, thank 
you.” 

“One moment.” There was a 
pause. 



PLEASE STATE MY BUSINESS 



149 



“Hello?” The voice could hard- 
ly be heard over the background 
noise. 

“Hello. Is this Professor Blat- 

sky?” 

"It is. Who is this?” 

“My name is Stretch — George 
Stretch. Listen closely, I have 
something very important to tell 
you.” 

“Well,” the voice at the other 
end sounded dubious, “if you say 
so. Wait a second, I’ll turn off 
the apparatus — I can hardly 
hear you over the noise.” 

“No,” Stretch shouted, as he 
heard the clunk of the earpiece 
being put down on the table. 
“Blatsky, for Chrissake listen to 



me Don't ...” The phone went 
dead. 

After a long moment, Stretch 
softly hung up the phone. He 
jammed a big cigar in one cor- 
ner of his mouth, lit it, and stared 
savagely at the wall. Miss Apple- 
ton was still in her trance. 

Stretch said a short expletive 
curse word experimentally. It 
sounded good. He repeated it, 
strode across the room and burst 
into his office. 

A small, black object scurried 
across the office wall and spat 
accurately at his cigar tip. The 
cigar instantly went out. 

Stretch was speechless.

A decade and a half ago, just about exactly, a small group of science- 
fiction writers and others were busily putting the finishing touches on a 
proposed new science-fiction magazine. The man in charge of the operation 
was H. L. Gold; the magazine was Galaxy. 

Well, time has passed. Due to reasons of personal health Horace Gold 
has had to curtail his activities, and one of the activities curtailed was 
editing Galaxy ; but in the decade-plus during which he was at the helm he 
produced a magazine which almost literally turned the field upside down. 
He gave us Fritz Leiber's The Big Time and Isaac Asimov's The Caves of 
Stetl; he published most of Robert Sheckley's earliest stories, and many of 
Clifford Simak's best ones. He spurred Cordwainer Smith and myself — that 
is, the fellow who is now running things, Frederik Poh! — into regular writing; 
and he retrieved writers like Ray Bradbury and discovered writers like Edgar 
Pangborn. 

Next issue is Galaxy's fifteenth anniversary. We propose to celebrate 
it with a special issue. It will have stories by all the people we've mentioned 
— yes, Gold, Leiber, Asimov, Sheckley, Simak, Smith, Pohl, Bradbury and 
Pangborn, among others — and we think it will be a collector's item for a 
long time to come .

The “optimum” and "maxi- 
mum” densities of population 
that can be supported by a 
single planet without access to 
external resources have been 
the subjects of perennial spec- 
ulation. Both terms are rela- 
tive and their definitions have 
varied in time and space ac- 
cording to the conditions cur- 
rently prevailing on a given 
world. If we accept the opin- 
ions of the inhabitants “opti- 
mum density” has been achiev- 



ed and approximately main- 
tained on sundry worlds at 
different times. The various es- 
timates of “maximum density” 
never have been verified con- 
clusively by actual experience 
but the history of our ancestral 
Terra during the late Twenties 
provides us with the closest 
known approach to an experi- 
mental determination. 

At least one thinker of the 
ancient world believed that the 
maximum density is also the

optimum. We refer to the social 
and economic analyst Henry 
George . 

Rimstar: Introduction to Ga- 
lactic Archeology (7007 E.C.) 

That the earth could main- 
tain a thousand billions as 
easily as a thousand millions is 
a necessary deduction from the 
manifest truths that, at least 
as far as our agency is con- 
cerned, matter is eternal and 
force must continue to act . 

Henry George: Progress and 
Poverty (1879 etc. E.C.) 

In the year 279b, the Earth 
maintained in comfort a popu- 
lation of a thousand billions — 
and they all lived happily ever 
after. But it wasn’t easy . 

I 

I n the spring of 2794, Jothen 
Kent, who was the senior wa- 
ter engineer of a standby Disas- 
ter City named Gitler, Mo., was 
still trying to persuade Kim 
Wernicke to marry him. It wasn’t 
easy. In pursuit of this campaign, 
he had managed to wangle a 
joint vacation for the two of them 
from the Union of Occupied 
Classes. That hadn’t been easy, 
either, but love occasionally 
laughs even at UNOC, which has 
to process — and mostly refuses 
— 1.6 billion vacation applica- 
tions per month. 

He picked her up at Starved 
Rock Biological Preserve, where 
she was an ecological surgeon. 



The Rock was a much coveted 
vacation resort in itself, for here 
one could see a sampling of some 
of the many thousands of ani- 
mal and plant species which had 
once been allowed to run wild 
over the face of the Earth, all 
carefully housed in compart- 
mented environments as much 
like the originals as human in- 
genuity could devise. For a popu- 
lation used to nothing but the 
megalithic cities, and the unend- 
ing bamboos, giant sugarcane, hy- 
bride poplars and Monterrey 
pines which made up the World 
Forest, a place like the rock was 
a fairyland. 

Jothen wasted no time gawp- 
ing at it, however; for one thing, 
he had seen most of it before, 
and as an engineer his interest 
in wildlife was small at best. In- 
stead, he pushed his way as ra- 
pidly as possible through the oth- 
er visitors on the mobile sight- 
seers’ highway, cherishing his sur- 
prise. 

Kim’s sector was North Ameri- 
can Temperate, the only remain- 
der of that once vast, bluely syl- 
van, raptly still ecology any- 
where on Earth; the last frag- 
ment of the realm of deer and 
bears and wolverines and wild 
tobacco and sugar maples and 
oaks, and quiet everywhere un- 
der smoky skies. Here, at least, 
it would never change, and for 
that reason Kim clung to it — 



152

not for the rainbow trout in the 
brooks, nor for the snow that fell 
every year, or the squirrels which 
sat in the crotches of unfamiliar 
trees chiselling away at black 
walnuts, but because this was all 
of it that there was or ever would 
be, and it was permanent and 
immune to man in its glittering 
silicoid womb. 

Or so — cloudily, to be sure — 
Jothen saw it. He did not pre- 
tend to understand Kim well. 

He stepped off the highway at 
the base of the sector HQ tower, 
and finally was allowed the use 
of an official elevator to the sec- 
tor surgeon’s office. Kim came 
forward at once, holding out her 
hands. She was a tall girl of the 
type that was once called Can- 
adian blonde, with long black 
hair, blue-green eyes, and four- 
count-them-four dimples, and as 
usual she took his breath away. 

tt'\7'ou’re as prompt as ever,” 
she said, smiling. “No- 
body’s prompt any more. But for 
once I’m almost ready.” 

“Good for you. We’ll need to 
stay on schedule — I have rock- 
et passes.” 

“I know, that’s why I hurried. 
I’m all packed. But Jo, where are 
we going? Is it still a mystery?” 
Jothen grinned. “No, not any 
more. We’re going to Australia.” 
“Australia!” Kim clasped her 
hands together like a child. “Oh, 



Jothen! To the Barrier-hilthon?” 

“No,” Jothen said, drawing out 
his surprise to the last. “Nowhere 
so commonplace. Guess again.” 

“I can’t. Tell me before I kick 
you.” 

“We’re going to Triton Reef.” . 

“Triton Reef! You mean — 
we’re going to live on the Reef — 
with Tritons?” 

“Don’t look so distressed! The 
Tritons welcome Drylander visi- 
tors. They’ve got dry, comfort- 
able guest quarters available, 
with all the modern amenities. 
You won’t live twenty-four hours 
a day in a scuba rig or sleep in a 
tidal pool.” 

“Hmm,” Kim said. “Somehow 
I’ve always thought of them as a 
cold and aloof sort of people — 
taciturn, except with their own 
kind.” 

“Nothing of the sort, I’m told. 
They’re gay as dolphins. You’ll 
meet dolphins, too. The Tritons 
will act as interpreters.” 

On Kim’s desk, the telephone 
sounded three musical chimes, 
and she turned to it with an 
apologetic gesture. “Kim Wer- 
nicke here.” 

“This is the switchboard com- 
puter at the Barrier-hilthon. If 
you wish this conversation to be 
private please make the neces- 
sary preparations.” 

“It isn’t necessary; proceed.” 

A click, a series of pings, and 
another voice: “This is the com-

puter in charge of incoming mail. 
The parcel that you sent to Doc- 
tor Matouf arrived eight days 
ego. Doctor Matouf was absent 
then and has not yet returned. 
Shall I refer the material to Out- 
going Mail to be forwarded to his 
Istanbul address?” 

“Is someone caring for the 
specimens?” Kim said. 

“Yes. We summoned an ento- 
mologist from Kookaburra Bio- 
logical Preserve.” 

“Don't forward them then. 
Doctor Matouf was very specific 
that he wanted them held at the 
hotel until he returns from his 
current field trip. The Barrier- 
hilthon is his present base of 
operations.” 

“As directed,” the computer 
said. Came a silvery ping, then 
silence. 

“You can see why the hotel 
was on my mind,” Kim told Jo- 
then. 

“What was it all about?” 

“This Turkish entomologist — 
Kemal Matouf, he’s quite fam- 
ous — is revamping the classifi- 
cation of the Thysanura. That’s 
the group that used to be called 
silverfish. He maintains that the 
structure of their blood proteins 
reveals new facts about their evo- 
lutionary relationships. He’s ask- 
ing for specimens from every- 
where.” 

“Sounds very exciting,” Jothen 
said ironically. 



Hphe Great Barrier Reef is a 
-*■ vast platform of coral ex- 
tending southward from the coast 
of New Guinea along the eastern 
shore of Australia for over one 
thousand miles. Parts of the plat- 
form are submerged under rela- 
tively shallow water; parts are 
awash at low tide; and parts rise 
above the high tide level as atolls 
and islets. The outer rampart of 
the Reef is a wall of coral as 
dense and hard as concrete, an 
impregnable breakwater against 
the battering waves of the Paci- 
fic. 

Inlets along the barrier give ac- 
cess to the maze of channels, 
atolls, shoals, islets and sand- 
banks that lie behind it. This in- 
ner zone varies in width from 
twenty to one hundred and fifty 
miles. 

Seaward from the outer ram- 
part the water depth increas- 
es rapidly and finally plunges 
precipitously into the oceanic 
abysses. 

The Reef is an intermediate 
realm; a bridge between the two 
dissimilar worlds of dry land 
and open sea; the natural symbol 
of the Tritons who colonized it. 
The Reef colony was the most 
popular Triton community in the 
world, surpassing even the West 
Indian settlement that extended 
from the Bahamas to the coast of 



154 



GALAXY 



South America. It was a com- 
munity more dispersed, more 
self-sufficient, less mechanized 
and less regimented than the 
megalopoli of the Drylanders. 

The Tritons were not, however, 
so self-sufficient as to be indif- 
ferent to the good opinion of the 
Drylanders, whose tectogenetic 
creation they were : a new human 
species, to exploit the sea — with 
their co-evals the dolphins — as 
the Drylanders never could hope 
to. 

Triton Reef could not afford 
to ignore the Barrier-hilthon. 

An observer on the outer es- 
carpment of the Reef near the in- 
let known as the Lark Passage 
would have seen the upper por- 
tion of the Barrier-hilthon as a 
vari colored dome riding on the 
sea about five miles offshore. 
Actually, the Barrier-hilthon was 
an artificial island with its base 
planted in the bottom ooze at 
three hundred fifteen fathoms. It 
was an enterprise of the Trans- 
portation Corporation that pro- 
vided hotel accommodations for 
two million guests and a service 
staff of twenty thousand. Exter- 
nally, its architecture was sever- 
ely simple and compact — a steel 
globe thirty-five hundred feet in 
diameter. The portion above wa- 
ter showed itself as a dome thir- 
teen hundred feet high with its 
surface divided into twelve seg- 
ments of alternating colors — 



red, white, blue, white, red — 
that converged toward the yellow 
disk of the flyport at its summit. 
As seen from the air it irresistibly 
suggested but one metaphor — 
a gigantic beach ball afloat on 
the sea. 

\ projecting flange four hun- 
dred feet wide girdled the 
Barrier-hilthon at water level. 
The inner zone of this flange had 
been converted into a “beach” of 
white coral sand, complete with 
sea shells and picturesquely con- 
torted fragments of weather- 
bleached driftwood. A sea-water 
swimming pool occupied the zone 
between the beach and the up- 
curved outer rim of the flange. 
This outer rim excluded surf, 
sharks, and barracudas, while its 
curvature and overhang discour- 
aged venturesome swimmers who 
otherwise might have been tempt- 
ed to climb over it. Direct con- 
tact with the open sea, of a sort, 
was provided by large stainless 
steel grilles set in embrasures 
spaced equidistantly along the 
curved sea wall. Rollers that 
dashed themselves against the 
grilles entered the pool as show- 
ers of spray and smooth surges of 
water. 

Internally the Barrier-hilthon 
was an automated labyrinth of 
guest rooms, entertainment halls, 
service salons, escalators, moving 
floors, and elevators. Twenty 



156

levels each containing ten stories 
were reserved for these facilities; 
four more levels were for service 
installations. An indoor beach and 
pool encircled the hotel at the 
same level as the outdoor pool. 
Seen only by the service staff was 
another, hidden labyrinth be- 
tween the walls and beneath the 
floors — a labyrinth of pipes, 
cables, wave-guides, and convey- 
or tubes radiating from the com- 
plex of service mechanisms and 
their controlling computers that 
were stacked in a cylindrical co- 
lumn along the vertical axis of 
the Barrier-hilthon. Except when 
medical or dental attention was 
necessary the guests very seldom 
saw members of the service staff 
other than the life guards and 
swimming instructors on the 
beaches. It never occurred to 
them that there was something 
slightly eerie in this state of af- 
fairs since they had been con- 
ditioned from childhood to daily 
services supplied by articulate 
computers and other electronic 
devices. 

Situated on the second level 
beneath the flyport was the Mas- 
ter Computer that co-ordinated 
and supervised the subsidiary 
specialized computers which di- 
rected the automatic services of 
the Barrier-hilthon. But the Mas- 
ter Computer itself was super- 
vised. In a circular control room 
at its core a twenty-five-man 



team of monitors kept constant 
vigil in four-hour shifts. They 
worked in a twilight obscurity 
lit only by the vidscreens and the 
winking luminous dots and 
squares on their consoles. Here 
the human mind impinged dn 
electronic circuitry. Here the 
monitors received reports on mat- 
ters specified by them. Here de- 
cisions were made and actions in- 
itiated in situations in which the 
Master Computer found itself in- 
competent to act without instruc- 
tions. 

r T''he Master Computer spoke 
with a manifold voice. It 
carried on twenty-five different 
and simultaneous conversations 
with the monitors. 

“The tropical storm over the 
Solomon Islands is increasing in 
intensity,” announced the Mas- 
ter Computer to Monitor Nine, 
at the same time displaying a 
weather chart on the vidscreen. 
“It is centered over Bougainville, 
moving south-southwest at twen- 
ty miles per hour. Central wind 
velocity, fifty-five miles per hour. 
It may develop hurricane force. 
We are feeling peripheral wind 
and wave affects. Hurricane Ad- 
visory Alpha has been issued.” 

“Wait twenty-four hours before 
issuing any further Advisories,” 
replied Monitor Nine. “By then 
we’ll know more about the force 
of the storm and its path.” 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



157 



To Monitor Fourteen the Mas- 
ter Computer said, “A report has 
been prepared on the alleged ap- 
pearances of arthropods in guest 
rooms. Do you wish to receive it 
now?” 

“Proceed.” 

• “Two complaints have been re- 
ceived, claiming that arthropods 
were seen in guest rooms. The 
investigator interviewed the com- 
plainants and showed them life 
size 3-V movies of various arthro- 
pods with a portable viewer. 

“Complaint Number One: Ma- 
dame Renee Lamotte reported 
seeing a scorpion in her bath- 
spray compartment. Stated that 
she knew it was a scorpion be- 
cause, quote, it had a sting on its 
tail, unquote. When shown the 
movie of a scorpion she denied 
that it resembled the creature 
that she saw. Her comment on 
the movie of an earwig was nega- 
tive also. By this time she was 
in a highly agitated condition and 
refused to look at any more pic- 
tures. Her husband privately ad- 
vised the investigator that Ma- 
dame Lamotte has had an insect 
phobia since seeing a so-called 
historical 3-V drama of life dur- 
ing the Age of Waste, with em- 
phasis on the prevalence of insect 
pests. 

“Complaint Number Two was 
filed by Mulaka Ouagadu, who 
reported finding a centipede in a 
slipper. He failed to identify the 



pictures of a centipede with the 
creature that he claims to have 
seen. After viewing three other 
pictures he refused to go on be- 
cause he found them emotionally 
disturbing. He does not know 
Madame Lamotte but had heard 
the rumor about the scorpion. 

“Investigator’s conclusions: 
Madame Lamotte is a neurotic 
woman who imagined that she 
saw an insect-like creature and 
called it a scorpion. Ouagadu 
heard the scorpion rumor, be- 
came alarmed, and also had arth- 
ropod delusions. It is the investi- 
gator’s opinion that neither of 
the complainants, quote, are cap- 
able of distinguishing an ant from 
an angleworm, unquote. 

“No other complaints in this 
category have been received. End 
of report.” 

“Make a general announce- 
ment to guests and service per- 
sonnel,” directed Monitor Four- 
teen, “that rumors of scorpions 
et cetera in the Barrier-hilthon 
have no foundation in fact.” 

fp'he Master Computer said to 
-*■ Monitor Three, “The party 
of Tritons and dolphins is ap- 
proaching Sector Twelve as 
scheduled. The necessary an- 
nouncement is being made via 
the beach PA system.” 

The multitude on the beach 
halted their activites and listened 
to the resonant synthetic voice 



158 



GALAXY 



that rolled from the concealed 
speakers on the colorful dome 
that towered above them. 

“This is the Voice of Barrier- 
hilthon. We have made arrange- 
ments with the Tritons of Great 
Barrier Reef whereby you are 
about to receive visitors of a 
most unusual nature. In a few 
minutes some of the grilles in the 
sea wall of Sector Twelve will 
open and Tritons and dolphins 
will be admitted to the pool. No 
doubt each of you has heard 
many tales of various degrees of 
accuracy regarding Tritons and 
dolphins. Now you shall see them, 
talk to them, and obtain your 
information at first hand.” 

There was a general exodus 
from the pool and a babble of 
voices rose from the beach in 
agitated crescendo, subsided, and 
was followed by an expectant 
silence punctuated by the rhyth- 
mic swashing of water through 
the grilles as billows broke 
against the sea wall. Abandoned 
beach balls and plastifoam rafts 
bobbed about in the pool. 

Three grilles slid aside with 
metallic clashes and disappeared 
into slots in the sides of their 
embrasures. Through these open- 
ings the spectators on the beach 
saw the glistening curved front 
of a massive turquoise-green bil- 
low unheave itself, fling itself 
toward them, and pour into the 
pool in three hissing cataracts. 



Three dolphins plunged through 
on the crests of the cataracts, 
their sleek arched bodies mo- 
mentarily half out of the tum- 
bling foam-flecked water. A 
bronze-skinned Triton child lay 
prone on the back of each dol- 
phin between its head and dorsal 
fin, arms and legs clasping the 
dolphin’s body. Dolphins and 
children vanished in a white 
smother of foam. Then, midway 
between beach and sea wall, the 
dolphins surfaced explosively in 
a tremendous power leap that 
carried them to ten feet into the 
air. At the apex of their parabolic 
flight the three Triton children 
slid sidewise from the dolphins' 
backs, and children and dolphins 
dived into the pool in unison. A 
burst of applause rose from the 
beach. 

With the arrival of every bil- 
low more water gushed into the 
pool bringing more dolphins, 
more Tritons. Some of the Tri- 
tons had skins of a rich brown 
color, some were purplish-black, 
some were like brown-tinted 
ivory, others were dappled. The 
pool became alive with swimming 
Tritons and leaping dolphins. 

The three grilles clashed back 
into position. 

The dolphins were quick to per- 
ceive the possibilities of the float- 
ing beach balls and butted them 
into the air, aiming so that the 
balls fell into the throng on the 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



159 



beach. At first this created flur- 
ries of surprise, but the onlook- 
ers rose to the occasion and flung 
the balls back into the pool. A 
lively two-way beach ball bom- 
bardment began. 

r T~'he crowd commenced to move 
back into the water. Soon 
everyone was in the water. Even 
the non-swimmers were in waist- 
deep. Several haphazard games 
cf water polo got themselves or- 
ganized. Triton children were in- 
structing children from the hotel 
in the sport of dolphin riding. 
Tritons and guests raced each 
other to the sea wall and back 
— an unequal match, it should 
be recorded. There were experi- 
ments in conversing with dol- 
phins. The air rang with shouts, 
laughter, and splashing. 

A Triton girl hoisted herself 
from the water onto a plastifoam 
raft, stood erect, her black skin 
glistening like mobile obsidian, 
and emptied her gill- chambers by 
ejecting multiple jets of water 
from the slits in her sides. A ring 
of swimmers collected around the 
raft, clung to its edges, and plied 
her with a barrage of questions. 

“Why did you squirt spray like 
that?” 

“I can’t breathe air unless I 
empty the water out of my gills.” 
“I don’t see any gills.” 
“They’re inside, where you 
have your lungs.” 



“How long can you stay out of 
water?” 

“I have been out as long as 
twenty hours.” 

“What’s your name?” 
“Ruvani.” 

“Do you eat raw fish?” 

“Raw fish! Ugh! No! Mostly 
we eat from an autoserver. Some- 
times we catch fish, or crabs or 
lobsters, or dig clams, and cook 
them with a fire outdoors.” 

“A fire! Nobody is allowed to 
make a fire! You might set fire 
to The Forest!” 

“There isn’t any forest where 
we make our fires. We make 
them with driftwood on little is- 
lands behind the Barrier. Most 
of them are sandbars or bare 
rock. Some of them have a few 
wild trees. They’re too small to 
bother planting a forest on them.” 
“What’s that little rod fastened 
to your belt?” 

“That’s an electric shark prod. 
It pulls out into a long rod — 
like this. When a shark comes too 
close I touch him with the tip, 
give him a shock, and he goes 
away.” 

“It’s such a thin little rod. 
Where’s the battery?” 

“There isn’t a battery. The 
electricity comes out of me. Like 
an electric eel.” 

“Out of you! Oh, really — ! I 
don’t believe it. Prove it.” 

“All right. Put out your finger. 
Now I’ll touch my finger to 



160 



GALAXY 



yours. I’ll try to make the shock 
as light as I can. NOW!” 
“Ouch!” 

“Convinced?” 

“Yes! My arm hurts clear up 
to my shoulder. Could you kill a 
person?” 

“I don’t think so. I’ve never 
tried. I have killed moray eels.” 
“Don’t you feel the shock your- 
self?” 

“Not the way you did. It feels 
— it’s hard to say how it feels. 
It’s a sort of thump between my 
shoulder blades, like being hit 
with a rubber hammer.” 

“Why do you use a rod? Why 
don’t you just touch the shark 
with your hand?” 

“Too risky. When a shark feels 
a shock he may lash around with 
his tail or bite blindly in all di- 
rections. Or he may take off like 
a rocket. One can’t be sure of 
what he may do.” 

Ruvani’s ordeal — though she 
bore it very well — might have 
gone on for an hour, as it had 
often before; but this time she 
was interrupted. A siren wail 
from the PA speakers rang over 
the pool. 

“Your attention, please,” a 
commanding voice boomed. 
“Your attention, please. A trop- 
ical storm is approaching from 
the northeast. Clear the beach 
and pool. Guests will please re- 
turn to the hotel and remain in- 
doors until further notice. The 



grilles will be opened and Tri- 
tons and dolphins will kindly re- 
turn to their homes. That is all.” 
There was a general stir of 
movement on the beach, but it 
was not a scramble. There had 
been something vaguely reassur- 
ing in the tone in which the com- 
puter had said “That is all,” as 
though tropical storms were no 
novelty to the Barrier-hilthon. 

As indeed they were not; but 
the computer’s “That is all” had 
not been quite candid. In fact, 
hazardous conditions on the 
beach due to the approaching 
storm were not likely to occur 
for another twenty-four hours. 
The object of the warning had 
been to move everyone to a safer 
location, without causing a panic, 
in order to avoid a danger of an 
entirely different nature. 

Ten minutes ago, the Master 
Computer had stunned the moni- 
tors by announcing : 

“THE BARRIER-HILTHON 
IS SINKING.” 

Ill 

'117'hen Jothen Kent had been 
' ’ flying toward Starved Rock 
Biological Preserve some hours 
previously, his attention had been 
focussed on the Preserve itself, 
his thoughts wholly centered on 
Kim. But now Kim was with him, 
they were flying to make the 
rocket connection at Chicago, and 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



161 



the Preserve lay far behind on 
the southwestern horizon, gleam- 
ing under a late afternoon sun. 

Now he was scrutinizing a 
puzzling phenomenon that had 
appeared on the skyline ahead. It 
resembled a low range of moun- 
tains, grayish mauve in the dis- 
tance, that lay along the entire 
northeast quadrant. Mountains? 
In Illinois? As they drew nearer 
he could see the usual forested 
terraces, but the bluffs that sep- 
arated the terraces were bands 
of pastel colors. He turned to 
Kim. 

“I’m surprised to see moun- 
tains here. I thought that all of 
this region was as flat as a table 
top.” 

Kim laughed. “Jothen! That’s 
Chicago! Or rather, it’s one com- 
er of it.” 

As the helicopter churned 
steadily across the sky, Jothen 
stared fascinated as the terraced 
ramparts seemed to rise higher 
and higher, and extend them- 
selves endlessly on other hand. 
Even before the first architec- 
tural mountain range was over- 
passed, still other ridges, peaks, 
chasms and buttes rose beyond 
it. Soaring towers and masts, 
great glittering domes, and skele- 
ton frameworks of new construc- 
tion materialized in the blue dis- 
tance. As they advanced farther, 
the monolothic city spread be- 
neath them from horizon to hori- 



zon, a bewildering tracery of 
green terraces and tinted walls. 

“I suppose I shouldn’t be as- 
tonished,” Jothen said, rousing 
himself from his hypnosis with 
considerable effort. “I’ve seen 
some of this in photobooks. But 
I never appreciated the real big- 
ness of it. I’ve been holed up in 
a Disaster City for so long that 
I’ve forgotten how jammed the 
rest of the world is.” 

A great climactic pyramid rear- 
ed itself before them, a Mount 
Everest towering above lesser 
peaks. The sun, low in the west, 
lighted its terraces and walls with 
a coppery glow. The forefront of 
a convoluted, lowering gray 
cloud-ceiling was gliding above it, 
carried toward them on the wind 
off Lake Michigan. As Jothen 
watched, a rippling misty curtain 
of rain descended from the cloud, 
blurred the outlines of the pyra- 
mid as with a veil of pearl-gray 
gauze, and bloomed magically 
with a giant rainbow ring. The 
circle of spectral colors formed 
a softly glowing frame around the 
pyramid. 

( ( XT ow there’s a perfect symbol 
^ of our endless argument,” 
he said thoughtfully. “A circular 
rainbow — no end, no pot of gold.” 
“And no marriage,” Kid said. 
“This is no world for children.” 
“Some people might think it 
beautiful. Look out there.” 



162 



GALAXY 



“I’m looking. That overgrown 
pyramid underneath your sym- 
bolic rainbow is the Municipal 
Services Center. It serves this 
whole urban monstrosity — three 
billion people, plus a million or 
two by the latest count. You see 
only a fraction of the pyramid; 
most of it’s out of sight, like an 
iceberg. It goes down to bedrock 
and deeper. 

“Somewhere inside there is the 
headquarters of the Civic Med- 
ical Services. I was born there. 
Every day, about fifteen thou- 
sand babies are born there and at 
each of the nine outlying region- 
al centers. Conveniently next 
door, there’s a branch of the Mu- 
nicipal Crematorium. Their total 
daily output is about one hun- 
dred forty thousand cremations — 
a net daily population increase of 
ten thousand. And for what? So 
this frightful human termitary — 
vitrolith and glastic and metal, 
pipes and cables and computers, 
escalators and elevators and mov- 
ing floors — can go on growing 
bigger and bigger, higher and 
higher, deeper and deeper, for- 
ever!” 

“Take it easy,” Jothen said. 
The helicopter flew into the cur- 
tain of rain and the rainbow 
circle vanished. Kim plowed on 
without noticing. 

“Do you have any idea how 
big this town is? It runs north- 
ward to Sturgeon Bay and west- 



ward halfway across Wisconsin 
and Illinois. From some of the 
high points on the west wall you 
can see the Mississippi on a clear 
day. It spreads fifty or sixty miles 
southward into Illinois and In- 
diana, and then on up into south- 
ern Michigan. Recently it an- 
nexed Lansing. The east wall is 
only about fifteen miles from the 
west wall of Detroit. It’s an ugly 
tumor on the face of the Earth — 
and we’re the viruses that creat- 
ed it. I don’t fancy the idea of in- 
creasing the virus population. 
There are too damn many now.” 

The helicopter veered around 
the pyramid. Only the higher pin- 
nacles of Chicago’s jagged roof- 
scape still smoldered in the 
orange-red light of the fading 
sunset. The rain had ceased. 
Venus shone like a pale emerald 
in the blue-green ribbon of un- 
clouded sky in the west. Along 
the eastward rim of the world 
constellations of colored lights 
flashed into being — some shin- 
ing steadily, others blinking a 
coded rhythm. They marked the 
far-flung flyports along the lake 
front, one of which sheltered their 
rocket shuttle. 

“People aren’t viruses,” Jothen 
said. “People have hearts and 
minds. All right, Chicago has a 
three - billion - plus population. 
That’s another way of saying that 
it possesses more than three bil- 
lion minds.” 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



163 



“Only a small percentage of 
which are being used for any- 
thing,” Kim said. “The rest are 
just contented-animal minds, 
dreaming on warm cushions. 
Cozy, but — ” 

( ( T) ut that’s not the whole 
story. There are degrees 
of creativity. Most people are 
creative in some degree. Their 
abilities may range from a simple 
knack of making up stories and 
jingles for their children, or for 
decorating an apartment, up to 
the genius level. If there’s one 
genius for every hundred thou- 
sand people in Chicago, that’s — 
mm — three hundred thousand. 
On the basis of the world popula- 
tion, that’s one hundred million 
high-level productive minds. 

“Of course only a relative 
handful is keeping us fed, housed, 
healthy, literate. But why stop 
there? There are millions doing 
imaginative, creative work — some 
of it revolutionary, some of it 
trivial — on their own initiative 
simply because they can’t endure 
idleness. There are amateur 
mathematicians, astronomers, 
potters, botanists, historians. 
There’s a group in Paris that has 
revived the art of printing on sili- 
cose; I’ve seen some of their 
books, and they’re stunning. 
There’s Doctor Matouf and his 
silverfish. Never underestimate 
the Doctor Matoufs. Who knows 



what could come of all this activ- 
ity — this spare-time, just-for-fun 
activity?” 

Kim looked at him speculative- 
ly for what seemed quite a long 
time. At last she said: “Jo, what 
led you into all this?” 

“My work only occupies part 
of my time. Mostly it’s a matter 
of routine inspection and reports. 
If a leaky valve needs replacing, 
it’s an event. The rest of the 
time, I read — just-for-fun. And it 
seems to me that the city isn’t 
just a malignant growth running 
wild. It’s like the rest of the 
world — a hive of creative brains. 
Does anyone have the right to re- 
fuse to marry and beget minds? 
The world needs all it can get, 
even if ninety-nine percent do 
little more than vegetate.” 

“For your information, Joth- 
en,” Kim said deliberately, “you 
have a one-track mind.” 

“If that’s your argument-in-re- 
buttal, I can’t give it a very high 
rating,” Jothen said. “The only 
trouble is, any kind of No is still 
a No. Well, I’ll stop spoiling your 
vacation for a while at least. 
We’re touching down; next stop, 
Cedros Island — and then the 
Reef.” 

IV 

F rom the moment of the Master 
Computer’s stunning an- 
nouncement, the monitors were 



164 



GALAXY 



tied up in emergency actions and 
i<a trying to locate the malfunc- 
tion in the Computer that had 
generated the announcement. It 
had to be a malfunction. But it 
was a first-magnitude malfunc- 
tion, and the monitors were tak- 
ing no chances. 

The check-out of guests was 
proceeding as usual. Guests en 
route to the Barrier-hilthon had 
been halted in transit. The water- 
tight doors of all entrances had 
been closed and secured. Only the 
check-out exits remained open. 
Transportation Corporation had 
been informed that evacuation of 
the hotel might be necessary. 

The reports relayed by the 
Master Computer indicated an 
increasing loss of co-ordination 
of its subsidiaries. The Barrier- 
hilthon was sinking . The Bar- 
rier-hilthon was not sinking; it 
was still securely embedded in 
the bottom ooze . The aqua- 
phone switchboard had ceased to 
function, thereby blocking under- 
water communication with sub- 
mersible ferries and shore instal- 
lations . Computer 5B (in 
charge of Ballast) had activated 
all pumps at full capacity and 
was emptying the ballast tanks 
. Communications were broken 
between the Master Computer 
and Computer 5B . 

All off-duty shifts of the main- 
tenance staff had been recalled 
and the combined force was 



searching for the malfunction. 
One task force had been ordered 
to stop the pumps manually. The 
series of doors leading to the 
Manual Pump Control Center 
had been closed by Computer 
5B and had to be manually 
opened — only to be closed again 
by Computer 5B, doggedly fol- 
lowing the electronic command, 
“Activate all pumps and keep 
them going until ordered to stop.” 
As the technicians checked and 
counter- checked the multi-mil- 
lion components of the Barrier- 
hilthon it became evident that 
there was not one malfunction 
but several. The hotel was afflict- 
ed by the computorial equivalent 
of schizophrenia. 

The monitors by- passed the 
Master Computer and issued a 
direct-line order to Maintenance 
Supervision: “Kill Computer 5B 
and stop the pumps.” 

Killing the computer was a 
simple matter of shutting off its 
power supply. Stopping the 
pumps was a more complex op- 
eration. There were two thou- 
sand pumps and they could be 
shut off only in sector units. To 
maintain the Barrier-hilthon’s 
axis in a precisely vertical posi- 
tion it was necessary that they 
be stopped in a definite sequence. 
It was an operation that never 
before had been manually per- 
formed. When the newly built 
Barrier-hilthon had been lowered 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



165 



into its present position the bal- 
last tanks had been filled under 
the control of the computers. 
Since that day only slight auto- 
matic adjustments in buoyancy 
were necessary to compensate for 
the daily tidal cycle. The pos- 
sibility that the Barrier-hilthon 
might spontaneously attempt to 
become free-floating had not been 
anticipated; the designers had 
envisioned nothing more than 
local flooding due to structural 
failure. Now, during the first 
stages of the manual shut-down 
of the entire ballast-pump instal- 
lation, great volumes of water 
continued to be discharged and 
the Barrier-hilthon’s buoyancy 
increased. 

The guests of the hotel, still 
happily unaware of the disaster 
that was taking shape, paid little 
heed to the transient shudders 
that quivered through the steel 
fabric of their automated micro- 
cosm. The few who noted them 
ascribed them to the impact of 
breakers on the windward sea 
wall. But the monitors knew oth- 
erwise. The steel globe had de- 
tached itself from the adhesive 
bottom ooze and was just barely 
afloat in its bowl-shaped em- 
placement. 

Hphe technicians manning the 
-*■ pump controls lacked the 
smooth co-ordination of Com- 
puter 5B. Their eyes were fixed 



on the tilt gauges, watching the 
axis of the Barrier-hilthon for 
slight departures from the verti- 
cal. Repeated minute tiltings and 
hasty compensations created an 
atmosphere of growing urgency 
tinged with panic. The result was 
a jittery, exaggerated caution and 
increasing slowness in their op- 
erations. 

Meanwhile the Barrier-hilthon 
floated higher and higher. The 
jutting flange that supported the 
beach and swimming pool was 
more than one hundred feet 
above water level, exposing its 
underside and a zone of the 
spherical hull encrusted with sea 
growths. The water from the pool 
poured through the grilles in 
noisy cascades. The docks for 
hydrofoil and submersible ferries, 
that transported guests to and 
from the mainland, were likewise 
above water level. Hotel guests 
were ordered to retire to their 
rooms, to remain there until 
called, and to prepare for de- 
parture. 

During these events a high- 
speed colloquy was taking place 
between the Barrier-hilthon’s 
Master Computer and the Master 
Computer at the Triton-operated 
base known as the Lizard Island 
Complex, inside of the Reef. 

“Barrier-hilthon to Lizard Is- 
land. Emergency. We are about 
to become free-floating due to 
computer malfunctions. Ferry 



166 



GALAXY 



docks are above water level. 
Evacuation is proceeding via fly- 
port only, imposing ten times 
normal load. Need all available 
helicopters and hovercraft.” 

The same appeal was transmit- 
ted to Transcorp by way of Prime 
Center. 

But the Lizard Island Tritons 
had further plans for speeding 
the evacuation. 

“Lizard Island to Cairns’ Reef. 
Emergency. Relay to satellite 
reefs. Barrier-hilthon will soon be 
adrift and is being evacuated. 
Send all submersible ferries to co- 
operate with aircraft. Sea is too 
rough for hydrofoils. Evacuees 
will be transferred from flyport 
to submersibles via rescue slings.” 
“Lizard Island to Snake Reef. 
Emergency. Relay . .” 

“Lizard Island to Osprey 
Reef. Emergency . .” 

The first flights of aircraft from 
Lizard Island and Snake Reef ar- 
rived at the flyport an hour ahead 
of the flight dispatched by Trans- 
corp from the mainland. At the 
same time the Barrier-hilthon 
swam clear of her emplacement 
crater. Under the mounting force 
of the southwesterly wind her 
enormous mass yielded sluggish- 
ly and began a creeping, reluct- 
ant drift toward the northeast 
and deeper water. All of her more 
massive installation — power 
plant, sea water distillery, fresh 
water storage, sewage processing 



— were in her lower levels. Her 
center of gravity was still below 
the water line. She moved with 
the ponderous steadiness of an 
iceberg, ignoring the increasing 
roughness of the sea. 

Maintenance Supervision re- 
ported to the monitors that one 
malfunctioning module had been 
located and replaced, and that 
automatic pump control was re- 
stored. The pumps were stopped 
and the hotel continued her drift 
with the elevation of the outdoor 
beach and pool — now completely 
drained — at slightly more than 
three hundred feet above their 
normal level. 

L izard Island received another 
distress call from the hotel’s 
Master Computer. 

“Barrier-hilthon to Lizard Is- 
land. We have been hit by a fifty- 
mile gust. Aerodynamic force on 
outdoor swimming pool flange 
tilted vertical axis two tenths of 
one degree, causing oscillation of 
water in indoor swimming pool, 
which overflowed into adjacent 
halls. We are draining indoor 
pool. Increasing wind may cause 
dangerous rolling. We must re- 
submerge partly or completely to 
normal level. Take a fix on our 
position and give us probability 
of sunken crags or reefs in our 
extrapolated course.” 

The reply came after a momen- 
tary pause while the Lizard Is- 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



167 



land computer consulted its elec- 
tronic memory and triangulated 
the Barrier-hilthon’s position with 
radio direction finders. 

“Lizard Island to Barrier-hil- 
thon. Existing depth charts for 
your location are obsolete. Re- 
cent collapse of submarine cliff 
and extensive mud slides have 
drastically altered bottom con- 
tours. Resurvey incomplete. 
There was a submerged granite 
peak very close to your extrap- 
olated course. If its position and 
depth are the same as before you 
may collide with it whether you 
submerge or not.” 

The removal of evacuees by 
aircraft and rescue sling was pro- 
ceeding from the outdoor beach 
as well as from the flyport. The 
operation was hampered by the 
roughness of the sea and rising 
wind. The transfer from swaying 
rescue slings to rolling and pitch- 
ing submersibles had to be made 
in the water by swimming Trit- 
ons, who removed the occupants 
of the slings in a welter of waves 
and foam and swam with them to 
the submersibles where Triton 
hands hauled them aboard. The 
rate of transfer was frighteningly 
slow. In four hours approximate- 
ly five thousand had been evac- 
uated, and darkness had fallen. 
The tossing navigation lights of 
submersibles clustered around 
the Barrier-hilthon like a swarm 
of red and green fireflies. The 

168 



beams of their searchlights 
played over her striped dome, 
probed the air above for descend- 
ing aircraft, swept to and fro 
over the tumbling waves. 

Since she had not been de- 
signed as a navigable sea-going 
vessel the Barrier-hilthon pos- 
sessed no motive power, no rud- 
der, and no sounding devices, ob- 
stacle detectors, or other naviga- 
tion aids. The monitors were kept 
informed by the Lizard Island 
computer of their position and 
course with reference to the last 
charted position of the sunken 
crag. All occupants of the hotel 
had been advised of the probable 
collision and were in their rooms 
with the water-tight doors closed 
and secured. Everyone was wait- 
ing, listening for the first premon- 
itory shock or sound. The steel 
globe had become, in effect, one 
vast, blind, intently listening en- 
tity. 

nphe granite crag, studded with 
-*■ uneven rocky fangs, was the 
visible portion of a larger mass 
that lay buried in mud and coral 
sand — one corner of a great block 
that had been detached and up- 
ended by some ancient earth- 
quake. Its total bulk, had it been 
visible, would have dwarfed the 
Barrier-hilthon. And it had 
changed in neither depth nor 
position. 

The Barrier-hilthon bore down 
GALAXY 



upon the sunken menace with de- 
liberate inexorable slowness. Her 
rounded side grazed its spiked 
and saw-edged summit. The 
granite plowed with grinding and 
crunching din through her outer 
and inner skins, inflicting a mon- 
strous diagonal wound eleven 
hundred feet long. The rending 
metal emitted a jagged, rasping 
scream like the cry of some great 
beast in agony, then trailed off 
into a quavering squeal. Rum- 
bling torrents of bubbles erupted 
from the gash and raced upward. 
The Barrier-hilthon reeled, and 
the people in her rooms were 
thrown upon the sloping floors. 

At the first impact the hotel 
computers reacted with lightning 
swiftness. Each sector of every 
level was sealed off from the oth- 
ers. The axial service stack was 
sealed off from the rest of the 
structure. The doors to the beach 
and the flyport were closed. Sec- 
tors of the eighth, ninth and tenth 
levels were flooded; the unbal- 
anced globe changed its direction 
of tilt. 

The hotel went under swiftly. 
The sea poured over the sea wall 
and flooded the beach. The pic- 
turesque driftwood fragments 
floated away. A narrowing ring 
of foam climbed the red, white, 
and blue dome until the summit 
of the radio and video aerial atop 
the flyport control tower disap- 
peared in an eddy of foam and 



driftwood. The pumps shifted 
ballast at top speed; the hotel 
gradually righted herself and 
came to rest on the oozy bottom 
with the top of her control tower 
one hundred and fifty feet below 
the surface. 

Those who had been waiting 
on the windswept airfield of the 
flyport and on the outdoor beach 
had been washed away and left 
floundering in the stormy noctur- 
nal sea. Each felt that his last 
moment of life had come. But the 
sleek flanks of dolphins rose on 
either side, pressed against him, 
and bore him up. The hands of 
Tritons reached up from below, 
supported him, and towed him 
toward the wave-tossed submer- 
sibles. 

A preliminary report on the 
number of known casualties, the 
extent of the damage to the Bar- 
rier-hilthon, and the state of its 
automatic services had been de- 
livered to the monitors by the 
Master Computer. The flood of 
telephone calls from terrified 
guests was being handled by 
computers in the lower echelons 
of the electronic hierarchy. A mo- 
ment of silence prevailed in the 
control room. The submergence 
of the flyport aerial had closed 
that avenue of communication 
with the outside world. The 
thoughts of all twenty-five mon- 
itors were essentially, “What 
now? What do we do next?” 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



169 



nphe Master Computer spoke to 
Mon’tor One, 

“You have a call from the fly- 
port control tower. Do you wish 
to receive it?” 

“The control tower! But there’s 
no one there! We ordered every- 
one out before we went under.” 

“There is someone there now. 
Will you take the call?” 

“By all means. Put them on.” 

The face of a blonde young 
woman appeared on the vidscreen 
in front of Monitor One. A light- 
weight scuba mask with minus- 
cule oxygen tanks on either side 
was pushed back on her fore- 
head. 

“Hello, Control Room!” she 
called. “What has happened 
down there? Is it very bad?” 

“Bad enough, but better than 
we expected. But who are you 
and how did you get into the 
control tower?” 

“Perhaps you don’t know me. 
I’m Dorthy Summer, head of 
Submarine Products Corpora- 
tion. I came in a UWS — an un- 
derwater speedboat — with a Trit- 
on rescue team. They’re going to 
inspect the damage to your hull 
and take measurements so we can 
put a patch on it. As to how we 
got in, there’s a hatch in the roof 
of the control tower. We came in 
through that.” 

“That’s the access hatch to the 
aerial. How did you open it with- 
out flooding the place?” 



“We put a scapelock over the 
hatch and came in.” 

“A scapelock?” 

“A prefab escape airlock. Do 
you mind if we come down? 
We’re practically dry by now. We 
won’t leave a wet trail. We’d like 
to take a quick look around and 
talk to whomever is available.” 
“I’ll talk to you. We’re just 
about to change shifts. My 
name’s Defabio. I’ll be in the 
Monitors’ Lounge. All our trans- 
port systems are operating — ex- 
cept in the flooded sectors. Watch 
the location maps along the way. 
If you get lost use the nearest 
house phone and ask for Guide 
Service. The Level Computer 
will give you all the information 
you may need.” 

When Defabio greeted Dorthy 
in the Monitors’ Lounge she was 
accompanied by a Triton whom 
she introduced as Tioru. Dorthy 
was sheathed in an insulated 
heat-retaining all-over suit of 
fluorescent orange-yellow plastic 
with webbing between the fin- 
gers. Tioru, like his fellow Trit- 
ons, was not chilled by prolonged 
exposure to water temperatures 
down to fifteen degrees Centi- 
grade and was clad only in a 
yellow cincture. A green fiber- 
glass cylinder with closed ends 
was suspended from a nylon cord 
around his neck. 

“What’s in the case?” asked 
Defabio. 



170 



GALAXY 



“Video tape,” replied Dorthy. 
“I suggest that it be shown on 
your intercom system to every- 
one in the hotel. Then they’ll 
know what we propose to do. It 
should raise their morale, and I 
suspect that it needs raising.” 

i (, A nd what do you propose to 
-t*- do?” Defabio inquired. 
“Since this will be a project 
conceived and executed by Trit- 
ons I feel that Tioru should tell 
you.” 

“Thank you,” said Tioru, bow- 
ing slightly to Dorthy, then to 
Defabio. “There are two things 
that we can begin to do at once. 
First, to get all of your people 
out of the Barrier-hilthon. Sec- 
ond, to repair the damage to your 
hull. You have something more 
than two million people aboard 
and the only way out, at present, 
is through the scapelock. We 
won’t consider trying to get ev- 
eryone out through that. It would 
be like draining a thousand-gal- 
lon tank through a pinhole. 
You’ll need more scapelocks.” 
Defabio interrupted, “That 
scapelock on the control tower — 
how did you attach it without 
letting in water?” 

‘A scapelock is an eight-foot 
dome with an airlock on top. We 
cemented the dome to the roof 
with a metal-to-metal adhesive 
that hardens rapidly even under 
water. You couldn’t pull it loose 



now without taking part of the 
roof with it. A built-in pump 
empties the water out of the 
dome and the airlock. We went 
through the airlock and opened 
the hatch. No problem. 

“We estimate that we can in- 
stall five hundred scapelocks on 
your flyport landing field without 
crowding.” 

“Five hundred! Where can you 
get five hundred scapelocks on 
such short notice?” 

“We have a plant on Lizard Is- 
land that makes them, and a 
number of other things. We have 
a stock of about one hundred 
there and have begun making 
more around the clock. There are 
fifty more stored at Cairns’ Reef. 
We have ordered others to be 
brought in by unmanned rockets 
from Fiji and the Andaman Is- 
lands. Still others are available 
in the Bahamas. Perhaps we 
won’t need five hundred. We 
won’t know until we have clocked 
the operation. We’ll have to cut 
a hole through your airfield un- 
der each scapelock. We’ve re- 
quested permission from Trans- 
corp to do this. It came through 
half an hour ago. I have a tran- 
script for your files.” 

“Hold on!” protested Defabio. 
“The top of the control tower is 
one hundred and fifty feet down; 
the airfield, about four hundred. 
You can’t shove people out 
through your scapelocks at that 



172 



GALAXY 



depth. The water’s cold, and the 
pressure is around twelve atmo- 
spheres. They’d drown before 
they reach the surface. If they 
didn’t die of fright first. This is 
the first time in their lives that 
most of them have been outside 
their native cities. Many of them 
have never been more than a few 
miles from their apartment until 
now. And about ninety percent of 
them can’t swim.” 

At this point Dorthy broke in. 

“The video tape will prepare 
everyone for the escape routine. 
And we’ll put miniscubas on 
them. Like I’m wearing now. The 
little cylinders hold twenty min- 
utes oxygen supply. They were 
made for Drylanders’ use during 
brief underwater activity — when 
transferring from one sub to an- 
other while both are submerged, 
for example.” 

'Tpioru continued, “Each person 
will receive a five minute 
air-pressure buildup in the scape- 
lock. Outside there’ll be a Triton 
or a dolphin waiting. When he 
emerges he’ll be hauled up to a 
sub and through its airlock be- 
fore he can count ten. He won’t 
be exposed to the cold and pres- 
sure for long, and he won’t have 
to go all the way to the surface. 
The subs will be only forty or 
fifty feet above your airfield. It’s 
fortunate that you’re down as 
deep as you are. It’s blowing 



fifty miles an hour up above. 

“As soon as one sub has a ca- 
pacity load it will move out and 
another one will move in. There’ll 
be a traffic control system for 
subs set up in your control tower. 
We’ll bring our own aquaphone 
T and R equipment. And we’re 
setting up receiving centers on 
the mainland for your people. 

“Now — casualties. How many 
casualties do you have?” 

“The casualty check is still go- 
ing on,” replied Defabio gloomily. 
“We have twenty-three deaths 
that we know of. And a list of 
fractures and dislocations a yard 
long. Over two hundred when I 
came off duty. We can’t get to 
the ones in the flooded sectors. 
The rooms are tight but the halls 
are full of water under about 
twenty-eight-hundred-foot depth 
pressure. We can feed them via 
the autoservers as usual, and 
send in first aid materials through 
the parcel conveyor tubes. We 
can give them first aid instruc- 
tions by vidphone, provide music 
and 3-V movies, and that’s all.” 

“We’ll take out the accessible 
casualties first,” Tioru said. “The 
inaccessible ones will have to re- 
main inaccessible for a while. 
We can’t open the rooms in the 
flooded sectors until we can pump 
the water out of the halls, and we 
can’t pump the water out of the 
halls until we’ve repaired , the 
hull.” 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL

“There’s another thing,” De- 
fabio added. “Small children and 
babies. We have forty-seven new- 
borns in our maternity ward — 
which is in an upper level, hap- 
pily, so it’s not flooded — and 
swarms of older kids.” 

“We’ve thought of them. We 
have something special. You’ll 
see. Don’t worry.” 

“Don’t worry!” Defabio said 
with a wry gesture; but of course 
he had to trust Dorthy, if not 
the Triton. He stood up. “This 
will take a full-scale meeting of 
the monitors to make it official, 
but I’ll take it upon myself to 
approve the whole project. No 
one in his right mind could ob- 
ject. We too would like to get 
out of here alive. I’ll put your 
video tape on our intra-mural 
network at once. You notify your 
Triton HQ to get the rescue op- 
eration rolling.” 

Then he paused, looking mo- 
mentarily non-plussed. He said: 
“How does one say ‘Thank 
you’ on behalf of two-million- 
plus people?” 

Tioru said gently: “To begin 
with, you wait until there’s some- 
thing to thank us for.” 

V 

^Tphe rocket carrying Jothen and 
Kim had traversed five time 
zones and was entering the sixth. 
During the first half of the flight 



they had seen little otner than 
the immense expanse of open sea 
— a world of blue water and ar- 
madas of clouds that, seen from 
an altitude of three hundred 
miles, were shreds of white fluff 
that seemed to rest on the blue. 

In the latter half of the flight 
they viewed, from an apparent 
altitude of five hundred feet, 
mile after mile of ocean that was 
churned into transient rosettes 
of foam by leaping fish — a min- 
ute fraction of the incalculable 
horde beneath the surface. The 
sea twinkled with the flashing 
myriads of silver-scaled bodies. 
A floating fish-processing plant 
cruised slowly through the agi- 
tated waters, reaping a living 
harvest. Once they sighted a 
herd of whales, fringed by dol- 
phins — a curiously pastoral sight. 

Now the Zoomvision viewers 
showed irregular green shapes 
embossed upon the blue field, 
each bordered by a white line 
of beach and surf. Scattered 
among the lush islands were the 
white rings and crescents and fila- 
gree patterns of reefs and atolls. 

“If we’re on schedule we 
should be near the Solomon Is- 
lands,” Jothen said. “I think I 
can see a few of them strung out 
along the horizon. And there’s 
something a bit more spectacular. 
Take a look, Kim.” 

“I see some elongated islands,” 
Kim said, “and a whirlpool of 



174 



GALAXY 



clouds coming up over the rim of 
the Earth. It’s like a scale model 
of a spiral galaxy.” 

“It’s the topside of a typhoon. 
This one must have built up so 
fast that it got out of hand be- 
fore the Weatherwatch boys 
could spike it. I hope Osprey Reef 
is well out of it.” 

“Is that where the Triton fam- 
ily’s to meet us? What do you 
know about them?” 

“Very little. There are three of 
them. The father’s name is Storm, 
which 1 hope isn’t prophetic. He’s 
an assistant to Dorthy Summer, 
the head of Submarine Products. 
Their home is on a coral islet they 
call Seahorse Reef. It’s part of 
the outer Barrier. I . I’m 
afraid I told Storm we might be 
on our honeymoon.” 

“You,” Kim said, “are abso- 
lutely incorrigible.” 

“I’ve been practicing,” Jothen 
admitted. But he was given no 
chance to pursue the subject fur- 
ther. 

“My viewer’s gone dark,” Kim 
announced plaintively. 

“So has mine. We must be 
starting re-entry.” 

4 CT’m sorry to have to tell you 
A this,” Storm said, “but 
something has happened that al- 
ters all of our plans. We are not 
going to be very good hosts, I’m 
afraid, and your vacation may 
not be very restful.” 



Jothen found it difficult not to 
stare at Storm’s rhythmically 
falling tears — all the Tritons wept 
mechanically when out of water, 
a transitional defect breeding had 
yet to remedy — and his fleshy, 
plume-shaped auditory antennae, 
constantly aquiver. He did not 
seem to disturb Kim, but then 
she was used to biological oddity. 

“Nothing personal, I hope?” 
she said. 

“No. A disaster at the Barrier- 
hilthon. Let’s board the s-ub and 
then I’ll tell you the whole story." 

Storm’s Sea Dart was a slen- 
der five-man craft propelled by 
centrifugally driven water jets. 
He took her down to five fathoms 
and left the rocket port’s harbor 
by an underwater exit. Here the 
conning tower’s vidscreen showed 
only a dusky green obscurity. 

“You’ll find this hard to be- 
lieve, and I’ll not blame you,” the 
Triton said. “But briefly, the 
storm you saw, plus a computer 
malfunction, floated the hotel out 
of its moorings and drove it in- 
to a submerged cliff. It went 
down like a stone — about a mile 
down, which isn’t too bad con- 
sidering that the hotel itself’s 
thirty-five hundred feet in diam- 
eter, but bad enough. There were 
two million people aboard at the 
time — the worst marine disaster 
in history, unless we can get 
them out.” 

“Get them out!” Jothen said. 

175 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



‘But the hull — the depth pres- 
sure — ” 

“The hull can take it,” Storm 
said. “The hotel was built with a 
safety factor of five; it’s mostly 
monocrystal iron fifty-six. The 
main problem is that the rescue 
area’s at sixty fathoms. Needless 
to say we’re working around the 
clock. And it occurred to me, Mr. 
Kent, that since disasters are in 
a sense your profession, you 
might like a look at what’s going 
on.” 

“I would indeed. Kim?” 

“Of course.” She looked out at 
the murky water. “But will we 
be able to see anything?” 

“Oh, the flyport — that’s the 
work area — is illuminated. I 
can’t take you down to see the 
repair crew at work on the dam- 
aged hull, though. That’s beyond 
the safe limits for this boat.” 

The Sea Dart dived on a long 
slant, and the vidscreen darkened 
to a deep-violet-blue. A nebu- 
lous, ghostly area of greenish 
luminescence appeared on the 
screen. 

“There it is,” Storm said. “We 
have lights moored all around 
the flyport.” 

“Those poor people,” Kim 
said. “It gives me claustrophobia 
just to think of being in that 
thing.” 

“Me too,” Jothen said. “Espe- 
cially when I remember that you 
wanted to go there.” 



“But not on a honeymoon,” 
she said, startling from Storm a 
brief glance of pure bafflement. 

r T''he luminous area slowly ex- 
panded as the Sea Dart ap- 
proached. It emerged from the 
aqueous haze and became the 
circular yellow expanse of the fly- 
port, brightly lighted by a ring 
of buoyant shining globes, each 
reinforced with a cage-like grid- 
work of curved ribs. The globes 
were anchored around the rim 
of the airfield by mooring cables 
which were delineated by the red 
dots of marker lights. The field 
had been divided by lines of 
phosphorescent violet paint into 
a huge checkerboard whose 
squares were identified by shin- 
ing violet numerals. Many of the 
squares were occupied by a 
scapelock — a squat dome sur- 
mounted by a chimney-like air- 
lock. 

Two of the nearer airlocks were 
connected to what appeared to be 
either thick cables or flexible 
pipelines that rose at a steep 
angle into the deep blue darkness. 
They undulated lazily and were 
studded with equidistant round 
red marker lights. In reply to 
Jothen’s inquiry, Storm ex- 
plained. 

“You might call them a pair 
of supersnorkel tubes. When the 
hull was ripped open the Bar- 
rier-hilthon lost a great volume 



176 



GALAXY 



of air. Every time we open a 
scapelock it loses some air. The 
people in the hotel consume oxy- 
gen. There is a reserve of com- 
pressed oxygen in the hotel but 
we want to conserve it. So air is 
pumped into the hotel’s venti- 
lating system through one pipe- 
line and out of it through the 
other. The pipes are metal but 
long enough to have some flex- 
ibility. The pumps are mounted 
on motorized barges at the sur- 
face; they can maintain them- 
selves in nearly constant posi- 
tions against the wind and cur- 
rent.” 

The dark masses of five sub- 
mersible ferries hovered at a low 
altitude above the flyport like 
giant sharks — sharks with red 
and green navigation lights in- 
stead of eyes. Scores of Tritons 
and dolphins were swimming in 
the space between scapelocks and 
ferries. With a start of surprise 
Jothen realized the true magni- 
tude of the scene by observing 
the apparently diminutive size 
of the swimming shapes. 

Periodically a scapelock opened 
and disgorged a flurry of bubbles 
in a glow of light, to be followed 
by an awkwardly swimming hu- 
man figure wearing a miniscuba 
mask. Immediately a Triton seiz- 
ed the swimmer and drew him 
rapidly upward toward a submer- 
sible. The lighted orifice of an air- 
lock opened on the underside of 



the vessel’s hull, the Triton thrust 
his protege into the opening, wait- 
ed until the airlock closed, and 
then swam down to his assigned 
scapelock. 

A submersible freighter floated 
down from the upper darkness 
and came to rest at a level above 
the ferries. An oversize circular 
port gaped open in its belly, emit- 
ting a bluish light, and from it a 
scrapelock descended at the end 
of a cable. A squad of Tritons 
converged on the scapelock, ac- 
companied it during its descent 
to the airfield, and guided it to 
the center of a numbered square. 

“We have been installing 
scapelocks since twenty-one 
hours last night,” remarked 
Storm. “There are fifty scape- 
locks in this load. We can install 
a scapelock and have it operat- 
ing in twenty minutes and hope 
to cut it to fifteen. We have 
slightly less than one hundred 
operating but the evacuation is 
still too slow. According to the 
latest report fifteen thousand tw r o 
hundred people have been taken 
out.” 

J othen did some rapid mental 
arithmetic. “At that rate it 
will take over one hundred days 
to evacuate everyone.” 

“True,” replied Storm. “But 
the rate will increase as more 
scapelocks go into operation and 
as the teamwork improves. But 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



177 



we don’t plan to rely on scape- 
locks alone. We are rushing con- 
struction of a larger model that 
a freighter can lock onto with its 
cargo airlock. Then we can de- 
liver provisions directly into the 
Barrier-hilthon on a conveyor and 
take on a steady flow of passen- 
gers at the same time, through 
the same airlock, with a mobile 
escalator.” 

“Provisions. That would be a 
problem,” reflected Jothen. “How 
much does the hotel have?” 
“Not enough. Routinely they 
carry a two days’ supply. They’re 
rationing what they have.” 

“I take it that the bulk food 
containers are too big to go 
through a scapelock?” 

“Correct.” 

“Why not put the Barrier-hil- 
thon on a ninety percent liquid 
diet? Pump it in. Through a pipe- 
line. Soups. Purees. Low viscosi- 
ty pastes. It will be faster than 
unloading package goods. Then 
the other provisions will stretch 
further.” 

Storm smacked his right fist 
into the palm of his left hand. 

“Of course!” he exclaimed. 
“We can code it Project Quick- 
flow. We have all the heavy duty 
plastic pipe that we need, at 
Lizard Island. We were laying 
an underwater pipeline when the 
Barrier-hilthon sank.” 

“An underwater pipeline? For 
what?” asked Kim. 



“It’s a Deep Water Safari proj- 
ect. Its object is to pump oxy- 
genated water to a pilot-scale 
slime culture at the five hundred 
fathom level. We transferred the 
Safari people down here as soon 
as we heard that the Barrier- 
hilthon had gone under.” 

After explaining the Deep 
Water Safari and the slime cul- 
ture project to Kim and Jothen, 
Storm called Lizard Island and 
gave orders which inaugurated 
Project Quickflow. 

“We must move along,” Storm 
said. “I have some inspections to 
make and you have seen every- 
thing here that — No! You 
haven’t! One more thing. See that 
flashing light?” 

A blue-green light was blink- 
ing rapidly at the summit of one 
of the scapelocks. 

“What does that mean?” in- 
quired Kim. 

“It means that whatever comes 
out is to be given special care 
and attention,” replied Storm. 
“We’ll cruise along until we are 
closer to it.” 

The scapelock was near the 
edge of the airfield. Storm halted 
the Sea Dart so that they were 
within fifty or sixty feet of the 
winking light. Three dolphins and 
a Triton were circling around it. 

The hatch of the airlock swung 
open, releasing the usual cloud 
of bubbles. A transparent sphere, 
ribbed with a grid of reinforcing 



178 



GALAXY 



rods, began to float out of the 
airlock. A miniature blinking 
glow panel illuminated the in- 
terior of the sphere. 

“It looks like one of the air- 
field light globes,” remarked 
Kim. 

“It is one of the same type but 
with most of the glow lining re- 
moved, and a heater and other 
modifications added,” Storm, 
said. 

nphe sphere was enclosed in a 
net bag with a line attached. 
A dophin darted in, seized the 
line in its mouth, and soared 
toward the nearest submersible, 
the sphere floating above it like 
a balloon. 

Inside the sphere, stirring rest- 
lessly in a nest of white silicose, 
was a small, red, wrinkled baby. 

“Well — !” ejaculated Kim. 
“How did that happen to be in 
the Barrier-hilthon? It looks as 
if it were bom yesterday.” 

“It may have been,” agreed 
Storm. “Or an hour or two ago. I 
understand that the maternity 
ward had over fifty of them when 
the hotel sank.” 

“What were the parents think- 
ing of?” marveled Kim. “They 
must have known . Why didn’t 
they stay at home?” 

“When one makes a reservation 
at the Barrier-hilthon three or 
four years in advance one doesn’t 
stay at home,” replied Storm. 



“One goes ahead with one’s v a- 
cation and has the baby at the 
Barrier-hilthon. It gives the par- 
ents something to boast about. 
The child also, when it’s older. 
Now, who wants to go where? 
I’m about to make an inspection 
tour of the operation inside the 
Barrier-hilthon. Would either or 
both of you care to accompany 
me?” 

Jothen spoke quickly. “I 
would.” 

Kim shuddered. “Not I. I’ve 
seen enough of this gloomy un- 
derwater world. I’d rather go 
to Seahorse Reef and watch the 
surf.” 

A call via aquaphone to the 
Barrier-hilthon enabled Storm to 
locate another Triton who agreed 
to convey Kim to the Reef in the 
Sea Dart. Jothen felt powerfully 
that he ought to go with her, 
after all; but thus far he had no 
reason to suppose sticking by 
her would advance his cause any 
further than parting from her for 
a while — and the opportunity 
before him now was one that 
would never be repeated. 

Jothen experienced his first 
miniscuba transfer when he ac- 
companied Storm into the Bar- 
rier-hilthon by way of the scape- 
lock on the roof of the flyport 
control tower. Two recorded mes- 
sages were awaiting Storm at his 
temporary office in the hotel. 
One was from Maintenance Su- 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



179 



pervision with the information 
that repairs to the hull had reach- 
ed a stage that permitted the 
opening of one of the flooded sec- 
tors, Number Seven in Level 
Ten. The other message, from 
the Council of Monitors, stated: 
“All computer malfunctions 
have been traced. Total number, 
seven; four of them in the Mas- 
ter Computer. Examination of 
the affected modules show that 
the cause was the same in every 
case — a short circuit caused by 
a small insect lying across two 
or more segments of the printed 
circuits. All were either dead or 
moribund when found. A speci- 
men is being forwarded to your 
message receiving station. Still 
others have been found in the 
ventilation ducts. Presumably 
they were distributed through 
Hie hotel by this means. Their 
source is unknown.” 

The specimen was embedded 
in a square of clear plastic. It 
was a small, bristly, silvery-white 
creature less than half an inch 
long. 

VI 

tt/^ould things like this sink 
the Barrier-hilthon?” de- 
manded Jothen incredulously. 

“It would seem that they did,” 
Storm replied. “Another ques- 
tion: How did they come here? I 
wonder if the Barrier-hilthon has 



an entomologist among its 
guests?” 

The word “entomologist” rang 
a bell of memory in Jothen’s 
mind. He said, “There might be 
one by the name of Doctor Kemal 
Matouf. Ask the Guest Register 
Computer if he’s still here.” 

Storm was informed by the 
computer that Doctor Matouf 
had been assigned to Room Nine- 
ty-Seven, Block Six, Zone Eight, 
Floor Five, Sector Seven, Level 
Ten; that this section of the 
hotel contained rooms provided 
with basic laboratory facilities 
for the convenience of guests on 
scientific missions; and that after 
the sinking of the hotel Doctor 
Matouf had ceased to answer his 
vidphone. 

“Sector Seven, Level Ten,” re- 
peated Storm. “That’s the one 
that has been reopened. I’ll make 
a survey of the situation there 
and we can look in on Doctor 
Matouf at the same time. Let’s 
hope that he’s alive.” 

Jothen followed Storm through 
a maze of halls and chambers di- 
rectly beneath the airfield. Here 
a team of Tritons was prepar- 
ing a throng of hotel guests for 
their transit through the scape- 
locks. The air rang with the cla- 
mor of many voices. The Tritons 
were adjusting miniscubas, re- 
peating last-minute instructions, 
allaying the fears of the timid. 
From this focus of activity an 



180 



GALAXY 



automatic elevator took Jothen 
and Storm to Level Ten — a two 
thousand foot plunge. 

The halls in Sector Seven were 
wet and permeated by a dank 
fishy odor. Clean-up crews were 
clearing the halls of assorted fish, 
crabs, streamers of seaweed, 
jellyfish blobs, sand, and other 
marine miscellany. Many rooms 
were untenanted, with doors ajar; 
their occupants had been moved 
to vacated rooms on higher levels. 

Jothen stepped warily around 
a small octopus that lay upon the 
floor, squirming feebly, just as 
Storm halted before a closed door 
bearing the number 10-7-5-8-6- 
97. 

“Here we are,” said Storm. 
“This is the doctor’s room.” He 
pulled on the door handle but 
the door was immovable. “HU 
have to violate his privacy by 
unlocking his door and walking 
in. It’s possible he may not be 
alive to resent it. An imperfect 
weld, a ruptured service conduit, 
and the sea would have flooded 
his room in an instant.” 

Storm unlocked the water- 
tight door and pulled it open, re- 
vealing a brightly lit and incred- 
ibly cluttered room. A swarthy, 
heavy-set man looked up from 
the trace on the ribbon of paper 
issuing from the infra-red spec- 
trophotometer clamped to a 
built-in work table beside him. 
His face expressed anger. 



“Is it your customary behavior 
to burst into the rooms of oth- 
ers, uninvited?” he demanded. 

“By no means,” replied Storm. 
“Are you Doctor Matouf?” 

“Of course I’m Doctor Matouf! 
Who are you?” 

“My name is Storm. I’m super- 
vising the Barrier-hilthon rescue 
operation under Doctor Summer 
of Submarine Products. It has 
been impossible to get a response 
from you for many hours al- 
though repeated calls were made 
by phone. It was suspected that 
you might be dead.” 

“You received no response be- 
cause I disconnected the phone. 
Some prankster annoyed me with 
incessant calls about the hotel 
sinking. Obviously it can’t sink 
when it’s already on the bottom.” 
“It floated free and then sank. 
It rolled badly a few times. 
Didn’t you notice that?” 

“There was an earthquake. I 
noticed that. They’re not uncom- 
mon in this part of the world. 
The spectrophotometer is secure- 
ly mounted and suffered no dam- 
age, so I saw no reason to be 
alarmed.” 

CCTf you doubt that the hotel 
A sank, just look into the 
hall,” Jothen suggested. “There’s 
an octopus with arms a foot long 
just outside of your door.” 

The doctor’s only response was 
a look of scornful disbelief. 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



181 



Storm held out the plastic 
square containing the specimen, 
and said, “Several of these crea- 
tures got into the computers and 
caused short circuits. Then all the 
trouble happened. Do you know 
anything about it?” 

“Certainly I do. It’s a silver- 
fish, Lepisma saccharina, one of 
the commonest species of Thy- 
aanura. I have two cultures of 
them here, as well as several 
other species. I am making a 
study of the blood proteins of the 
entire order.” 

Further questing revealed that 
three cultures of saccharina had 
been sent to Doctor Matouf by 
a North American collaborator 
"in Hunger Rock, or perhaps it 
was Starved Rock”; that during 
Doctor Matouf’s recent absence 
the temporary custodian of the 
cultures had spilled the contents 
of a breeding jar; and that since 
then the doctor’s room had been 
inhabited by an indefinite num- 
ber of roving silverfish. 

The insects were not exactly 
a surprise to Jothen, not after 
finding that Dr. Matouf was in- 
deed still aboard the hotel — 
though never having seen a 
silverfish before, he had expected 
something decidedly more fish- 
like. Nevertheless, he was pleased 
to see them. Besides having ship- 
wrecked the Barrier-hilthon, the 
minute, primitive creatures had 
given him an inspiration that he 



was beginning to minx was al- 
most diabolical. 

On departing from Doctor 
Matouf’s room they discovered 
that the octopus had shifted its 
position and was now directly in 
the doorway. Storm bent over, 
picked it up by the tip of one 
tentacle, regarded the writhing 
mass thoughtfully, and tossed it 
into the hall. Jothen glanced 
back at Doctor Matouf. He was 
sitting in a state of complete im- 
mobility, wide eyed, with his eye- 
brows at maximum elevation. 

Storm and Jothen continued 
their tour of Sector Seven and 
discovered an emergency clinic 
established in a suite of connect- 
ing rooms. To Jothen’s surprise 
it was staffed entirely by Tritons. 
It had not occurred to him that 
the Tritons would have their own 
physicians and surgeons. A steady 
stream of casualties flowed in 
for treatment. Another stream 
flowed out, to be transported to 
the Barrier-hilthon hospital in 
the upper levels. 

“Does the hospital have room 
for all of them?” Jothen asked. 

“No. It’s overcrowded. The 
cases with minor injuries go 
out through the scapelocks 
like everyone else. Fortunately 
they’re the majority. The cases 
who can’t be put through a 
scapelock with safety are kept 
here. They’ll have to wait until 
we have our lock-on two-way 



182 



GALAXY 



cargo airlock in operation. Then 
they can be put aboard a freight- 
er.” 

“What about the dead?” 

“The dead can wait. They’re 
in the morgue under refrigera- 
tion.” 

S torm’s office computer had 
recorded two more messages 
for him when he and Jothen re- 
turned to Level Ten. One mes- 
sage was an Evacuation Progress 
Report : 

“One hundred five scapelocks 
in operation. Rate of transfer of 
evacuees, six hundred thirty per 
hour, fifteen thousand one hun- 
dred twenty per day. With maxi- 
mum number of five hundred 
scapelocks rate will be sixty 
thousand per day. The lock-on 
cargo-lock will add an estimated 
three thousand per day.” 

Storm rubbed his chin thought- 
fully. “Still not enough. At that 
rate it will take about four weeks 
to get everyone out. We’ll need 
more lock-on cargo-locks.” 

The second message was from 
the sewage processing plant: 
“How soon will movement of 
outbound cargo be feasible? We 
are storing compressed blocks of 
processed sewage solids in vac- 
ated rooms and halls immediate- 
ly above us. Storage problem not 
yet critical but suggest early re- 
moval to mainland fertilizer plant 
for esthetic reasons.” 



“How did they dispose of the 
processed solids under normal 
conditions?” Jothen inquired. 

“A special freighter came every 
day and removed the accumula- 
tion.” 

“Isn’t there some provision for 
discharging sewage into the sea 
in an emergency?” 

“No. The designers of the Bar- 
rier-hilthon didn’t foresee this 
kind of an emergency any more 
than they foresaw that a day 
would come when the hotel would 
have to ration its food supply. 
And speaking of food, you must 
be famished. I’m keeping my 
promise that I would not be an 
ideal host. I can offer you two 
choices: Eat here in the hotel, in 
which case you’ll receive a variety 
but in small quantity; or I can 
get someone to take you to our 
home where you may help your- 
self to our autoserver and have 
both plenty and diversity,” Storm 
said. 

“I’ll wait a little longer and 
have the plenty and diversity,” 
Jothen decided. Besides — he did 
not add — his own personal sil- 
verfish was ready to hatch now, 
and, as he well knew, the Bar- 
rier-Hilthon had already had its 
fill of those. 

He made the short passage to 
Seahorse Reef on a hovercraft 
that was en route from the snor- 
kel barges to Lizard Island. 
Darkness had fallen, the sky had 



THE SHIPWRECKED HOTEL 



183 



cleared, and the brilliance of full 
moon flooded sky and sea. The 
outer Reef was a low, dark, ir- 
regular wall athwart their course. 
An endless succession of rollers 
marched out of the northeast, 
moonlight glistening on their 
rounded contours. The rollers 
struck the Reef at an oblique 
angle, creating a parade of ghost- 
ly white spume geysers that tra- 
veled along the Reef from north 
to south. Seaward, the flash- 
es of rocket launchings on Os- 
prey Reef, below the horizon, 
flared and died like heat light- 
ning. Lizard Island, the Triton in- 
dustrial center, lay westward 
ablaze with lights on the horizon 
of the lagoon behind the Barrier. 

The hovercraft deposited Joth- 
en on Seahorse Reef and churned 
away across the moonlight water, 
riding above a misty cloud of 
spray hurled into the air by the 
downblast of its rotors. The sound 
of its passage receded, became a 
pulsing hum, and ceased. Sea- 
horse Reef was enveloped by a 
hushed, moonlit serenity — ac- 
cented but not disturbed by the 
incessant march of spouting surf 
fountains that rushed along the 
coral ramparts of the Barrier with 
a rhythmic seething sound. Joth- 
en felt that he had never seen 
such a luminous expanse of sea, 
such an immense arch of sky, 
such a host of brilliant stars, nor 
such a radiant moon. 



TT e spotted Storm’s home about 

*■ one hundred yards distant 
on the inner shore of the islet. It 
would have seemed no more than 
a rounded hummock of coral if its 
artificial nature had not been in- 
dicated by a lighted oval window 
and — on its summit — a rotating 
beacon that flashed alternately 
green and white. Sea shells 
crunched under his feet as he 
walked toward it over the spar- 
kling coral sand. He became 
aware of a murmur of voices and 
an occasional burst of laughter. 
He recognized Kim’s voice. 

He rounded a moss-covered 
corner of the house and discover- 
ed Kim and a Triton girl sitting 
on a small flat-topped peninsula 
of coral that extended into the 
lagoon like a jetty. A dolphin’s 
head was bobbing up and down 
in the water, squeaking and 
chirping. 

“Oh, there you are — finally! 
Jothen, this is Storm’s daughter, 
Ruvani.” 

The dolphin whistled sharply. 

“You forgot someone,” Ruvani 
said, laughing. “Jothen, meet 
Molo.” 

“My pleasure,” Jothen said. 
“But I’ve still got one more ur- 
gent piece of business first, if 
you’ll excuse me. Kim, could I 
speak to you a moment?” 

Kim allowed herself to be 
drawn aside readily enough, but 
her eyes were glinting. “What’s 



184 



GALAXY 



this, Jo? Not another turn around 
the circular rainbow?” she asked 
laughing. 

“No. I know where the pot of 
gold’s hidden, now.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Well, I think I’ll know in a 
minute. I’ve got two questions 
for you, and this time I’d like 
you not to answer the first until 
I’ve also asked you the second. 
Okay?” 

“Well, I guess so,” she said 
warily. “Go ahead.” 

“The first is: Will you marry 
me?” 

Now she did look startled. 
“That’s the first one? Hmm. 
Somehow I don’t like that grin 
of yours, Jothen Kent. What’s 
the second question?” 

Jothen grinned more broadly 
than ever. 

“The second is: Who sank the 
Barrier -hilthon?" 



“I don’t know,” she said. “What 
do you mean, who sank it? I 
thought some sort of malfunction 
sank it. Do you mean it was a 
human failure?” 

“Both,” Jothen said. “The mal- 
function was caused by a certain 
kind of wildlife that had no busi- 
ness running free aboard the ho- 
tel. The custodian of the wild- 
life was one Doctor Kemal Mat- 
ouf. And one guess who he got 
the critters from!” 

Kim’s face was a battleground 
over which amazement, conster- 
nation, anger and finally amuse- 
ment pursued each other. 

“Jothen Kent,” she said, “this 
is blackmail.” 

“That,” he agreed gravely, “is 
exactly what it is.” 

And so they lived happily ever 
after — but it wasn’t easy.

ead any good books lately? 
By and large, the first objec- 
tive of fiction is to establish con- 
tact between the writer and the 
widest possible audience. Wheth- 
er he writes to get something out 
of his system, to communicate 
something, or simply because 
there is money in it, the writer 
hopes in his heart of hearts to 
strike a response from the whole 
world. In those terms, the three 
outstanding writers of our im- 
mediate time are Erie Stanley 
Gardner, Mickey Spillane and 
Ian Fleming. Probably the most 
successful writer the English lan- 
guage has ever known is Edgar 
Rice Burroughs. None of these 
gentlemen can write his way out 
of a paper bag, as writing is un- 
derstood by three main types of 
literary specialists — teachers of 
composition, literary critics and 



the other working professional 
writers who provide the day-in, 
day-out reading matter for the 
fiction audience. 

Now, whether the fault is with 
the understanding, or is in fact 
with the culprits named in the 
indictment, it still follows, on the 
basis of evidence observed over a 
long period of time, that any 
writer who attempts what is com- 
monly called good prose, or who 
attempts a seriously intended 
comment on the human condi- 
tion, or tries to plot and charac- 
terize with some attention to veri- 
similitude, is deliberately re- 
stricting his audience. This is 
self-destructive madness. 

But madness is the common 
human condition and we have all 
learned to live with scores of dia- 
metrically opposed compulsions, 
the word is “compromise,” or, if 




186 



you don’t care for those connota- 
tions, “balance” or “maturity.” 
Somehow, most of us work it out; 
almost any day, one can meet 
working writers who are neither 
Gardner, Spillane, Fleming, Bur- 
roughs nor institutionalized. 

Any sign of the commonly un- 
derstood excellences in a piece of 
fiction therefore indicates one of 
two things. Most commonly, it in- 
dicates a craftsman consciously 
doing something difficult, for rea- 
sons which are not immediately 
explicable, are not simply logical 
and are the result of some often 
troublesome growth and change 
within an intelligent human be- 
ing. More rarely, it indicates a 
man doing something he can’t 
help, largely because it has never 
occurred to him to do anything 
that is not creative. In other 
words, an artist. A genius. The 
craftsman may produce a “bet- 
ter” variation on a given theme 
than the genius. Neither of them 
may produce anything anywhere 
near as “good” as the next gen- 
ius, or craftsman. That is beside 
the point. The point is there are 
three kinds of writers; those who 
can’t do much right except to 
overwhelmingly satisfy the au- 
dience, those who seriously study 
their trade and may very well 
have excellent technical justifica- 
tions for what appear to be mis- 
takes, and those who are a law 
unto themselves because they are 



extending the limits of the pos- 
sible in literature. And since there 
are compromises in all personal- 
ities, almost all writers combine 
some of these aspects — they are 
only more or less craftsmen, gen- 
iuses and what psychological 
phenomenology calls idiots sa- 
vants. Furthermore, no writer 
sells a product which can be def- 
initely test-run against another 
similar product. He sells a service 
— a subjective experience — to 
each individual reader. 

Problem : Where is there an ob- 
jective basis for determining 
whether a piece of fiction is “bad” 
or “good”? 

T he Three Stigmata of Palmer 
Eldritch, by Philip K. Dick 
(Doubleday; $4.95) may or may 
not be a good book; it is an im- 
portant, beautifully controlled, 
smoothly created book which will 
twist your mind if you give it the 
least chance to do so. Operating 
on a number of levels, the top 
one of which is a fast-moving nar- 
rative of business rivalry in a fu- 
ture Earth society, it proceeds to 
hand you a series of jolts straight 
to the dark corners of the mind. 

Reality is, as you may know, a 
fragile thing; each of us has his 
own idea of the world and his 
place in it. From time to time, 
we get into some serious difficul- 
ty which brings home to us some 
drastic indication that the 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



187 



“world” — that great compromise 
out there beyond our skin — does 
not agree with our picture. At 
such times, we may even teeter 
on the brink of the awful suspi- 
cion that we have never known 
who or where we are, and that 
any previous ability to function 
was a lucky chain of coincidences 
which has now broken. 

Science fiction and fantasy of- 
ten play on this; a typical story 
aimed into this area is the one in 
which the hero gets a clue that all 
the other people in the world are 
robots, investigates, and then dis- 
covers that he himself is a robot. 
In life, some of the extreme re- 
actions people display seem to 
stem from the next development 
of this personal setback; the sus- 
picion that nobody knows where 
we’re at. According to our bent, 
we may then decide that Charles 
Fort was “right,” and quote from 
him to prove the point; we may 
decide that there really is a God, 
or that God is dead — the possible 
ramifications are endless, and 
have been worked out in great 
detail by such people as St. Au- 
gustine, Spinoza and Friedrich 
Nietzsche, who dealt with them 
as hard logical questions of con- 
siderable urgency. I have no idea, 
of course, how deeply Dick has 
delved into the works of those 
people; more deeply than I have, 
no doubt. But one place I’m sure 
Dick has done a lot of his prelim- 



inary work on this book is in the 
recent work with hallucinogens, a 
fascinating business which has 
been waiting for a top-grade 
science fiction writer to take it up. 

Experiments with such sub- 
stances as LSD, in which the sub- 
ject is drugged into temporary 
dissociation from reality — that is, 
psychosis — normally are conduct- 
ed in the presence of the experi- 
menter, who also takes the drug 
and serves as the subject’s 
“guide.” He is able to communi- 
cate with the novice, is able to 
understand what he is undergo- 
ing, in a rough sort of way, and 
is to some extent capable of lead- 
ing him through the labyrinth of 
what is, or should be according to 
conventional views, a totally per- 
sonal and individual nightmare 
exploration of one unique subcon- 
scious. 

This phenomenon of ap- 
proximately shared hallucination 
— which, by the way, may very 
well be an artifact; a piece of pre- 
conditioning by an experimenter 
who is fudging Scientific Method 
— has led some people toward the 
possibility that there is what 
might be called a real unreality. 

However all this may be in 
truth, it is a fact that many 
people who have been working 
with this general series of drugs 
are relaxed, pleasant, of the opin- 
ion that commonly accepted re- 
ality is a game, and that what 



188 



GALAXY 



they experience is not insanity 
but increased perception. The real 
reality is, for them, a place where 
time and perception are variable 
and arbitrary, but what is exper- 
ienced is real, and marvelous. An 
important recent development in 
what could be called the “cult” of 
LSD is the promulgation of the 
ancient Tibetan Book of the 
Dead as the revealed, allegorical 
description of the real reality. 
That is, as a bible. 

All this has had its share of 
publicity, particularly when Doc- 
tors Leary and Alpert were can- 
ned from Harvard and Aldous 
Huxley spent his last days pros- 
elytizing for it. Additionally, 
there are several informative 
books on the subject, of which 
the one I own is LSD : The Con- 
sciousness-Expanding Drug, a re- 
cent collection of papers and 
essays edited by David Solomon. 
But I’m not here to review 
science-fact books, immediate 
appearances to the contrary. If 
you remember, I started to re- 
view a witty, sometimes light- 
hearted, and always fascinating 
piece of fiction by a man who has 
already won one Hugo award for 
the best science-fiction novel of 
the year, and just may deserve 
another for this one. 

To be glib, The Three Stigmata 
of Palmer Eldritch is something 
like an A.E. Van Vogt novel as 
Robert Heinlein and Frederik 



Pohl might have collaborated to 
write it. To be truthful, it is far 
more than a pastiche of anything 
else, because Dick seems to be 
something of a genius and is do- 
ing what that type of writer often 
does — borrowing techniques and 
tones from other men in order to 
say something entirely his own. 
There is also one wild scene 
which is a sudden infusion of 
pure Robert Sheckley, and I 
think obtrusively so, perhaps for 
the sheer fun of it. The remainder 
of the time, the whole creation 
resonates to the touch of the 
only present science-fiction writer 
who could possibly have done it. 

The basic situation is that 
Earth is warming rapidly; the 
temperature in New York City is 
180° Fahrenheit, and on the 
teeming urban Earth of that time 
— which is established as about 
one hundred years in the future, 
but functions exactly as our so- 
ciety would if it had slightly bet- 
ter technology — the only things 
anyone really cares about are 
coping with or ignoring the heat 
and the coming extinction of all 
life. The UN is concerned with 
doing something about it, the 
business community is dedicated 
to profiting from it, and the vast 
consuming public is alternately 
chivvied or lulled by these con- 
tending forces. The UN draft 
laws keep operating to pick up 
people and push them out into

the various colonies like the ones 
on Mars, where they all live de- 
sultory lives on the UN dole. The 
big stabilizing factor in this 
comic inferno is two-fold — Perky 
Pat layouts and Can-D. Perky 
Pat layouts are miniature sets, in 
incredible detail, of the apart- 
ments, cars, analysts’ offices, re- 
sorts and countrysides inhabited 
by two little dolls called Jerky 
Pat and her lover, Walt. All the 
colonists have them, and spend 
many skins — oh, I forgot; the ec- 
onomy is based on truffle skins, 
the only uncounterfeitable sub- 
stance — on adding new pieces to 
them. 

The layouts provide nearly 
perfect escape, for while they in 
themselves are only static sets, 
they become pocket universes 
when used in conjunction with 
Can-D, a hallucinogen. Under the 
influence of the drug, all the 
women playing with a given lay- 
out become Pat, and all the men 
become Walt. The Pat and the 
Walt. The confusions and orgies 
thus possible while sitting motion- 
less in a friendly gathering are 
quite something. 

Out of the fact that Can-D 
creates shared hallucinations has 
arisen a vague proto-religion, 
whose central tenet is that the 
Perky Pat world has some sort 
of validity. The colonists, who are 
far too busy with their layouts 
to do anything about their “real” 



environment, and who are in any 
case fed, clothed and sheltered N y 
the UN, are grappling with the 
notion that they are all in fact 
only avatars of Pat and Walt. 

However the Can-D/Pat logos, 
considered as the raw material for 
a religion, is subtly but crucially 
defective; the effect of Can-D 
wears off quickly, and in any 
case requires the layout; if the 
layout lacks as analyst’s office, 
for example, there is no way Pat 
can get her head examined. To 
top it off, the UN permits the 
colonists to have layouts — though 
they are illegal on Earth — but 
prohibits Can-D, which must be 
obtained from pushers. So the 
use of this spiritual resource leads 
to accumulating guilt but no re- 
demption. 

Leo Bulero, the entrepreneur 
who both manufactures the lay- 
outs and heads the Can-D organ- 
ization, knows full well how vul- 
nerable his position is. He is gal- 
vanized into panic when rival en- 
trepreneur Palmer Eldritch, who 
departed for Proxima Centauri 
many years ago and was thought 
lost, suddenly returns and mar- 
kets Choo-Z, a new hallucinogen. 

Choo-Z requires no layout and 
has UN sanction. Furthermore, 
its effect is apparently perma- 
nent, though it is a little hard to 
be sure of this. All the principal 
characters in this book are ex- 
posed to it at the crucial mo-

ment when Bulero confronts El- 
dritch, or shortly thereafter. Part 
of the hallucinogenetic effect is 
a complete disorganization of the 
time sense; another is totally 
“real” detail. Yet another is the 
appearance of Palmer Eldritch 
in everyone’s hallucinations, as 
the hero and, in effect, God of the 
hallucinated universe. Since El- 
dritch has long ago been given 
stainless steel teeth, an artificial 
arm and artificial eyes — the three 
stigmata — it is impossible to mis- 
take him. But, though Bulero 
knows, through his precognitive 
Perky Pat fashion consultants, 
that he will kill Eldritch — or God 
— in the future, he is redeemed of 
guilt because another attribute 
of Choo-Z hallucinations is that 
everyone develops a steel arm, 
steel teeth, and artificial eyes, 
and it is as Palmer Eldritch that 
he goes out to do battle with 
Palmer Eldritch, except that for 
the final third of the book it is 
impossible for the reader to know 
whether this is really real or 
whether it is still part of Bulero’s 
original hallucination, or whether 
the whole inferno is part of the 
hallucination Eldritch had when 
first exposed to Choo-Z on Prox- 
ima’s planet, or whether the 
whole universe, including El- 
dritch, book, reader and this is- 
sue of Galaxy are part of Proxi- 
man hallucination, or what. 

This is an approximate descrip- 



tion of the story. If it is confus- 
ing, it is nowhere near as con- 
fused as the reader who tries to 
stay anchored to reality as such 
a tiring is understood in the usual 
piece of fiction. Nor can it begin 
to convey all the detail or any of 
the side-tracks Dick drops into 
the story as casually as Heinlein 
handing you a complete picture of 
a civilization while telling you a 
story about two men out after the 
same thing. Unlike Heinlein’s 
Stranger in a Strange Land, which 
had the different purpose of be- 
ing about religion, Stigmata could 
easily function as a holy book in 
itself, since in Dick’s logical sys- 
tem it is entirely possible for a 
$4.95 1965 commercial book to 
publish accurate, mystically re- 
vealed word of events which not 
only have not yet occurred but 
might not ever, but nevertheless 
prove the beliefs which are the 
only true Salvation. 

Dick has really done it this 
time. Long recognized as the fore- 
most elaborator of the involu- 
tional shock technique first intro- 
duced to science fiction by A.E. 
Van Vogt, he not only hits the 
reader with a new and discon- 
certing idea at measured inter- 
vals, he has created a plot which 
loop-the-loops back through itself 
so successfully that there is no 
real telling where it comes out. 
The last line of World of Null- A, 
you may remember, was “The

face was his own.” Dick had add- 
ed “But who was he?” and he 
has put a capital H on “His.” 

Is it a good book? I couldn’t 
tell you in a month of Sundays. 
Should you buy it? Hell, yes!

r T^he Dark Side, edited by 
Damon Knight (Doubleday, 
$4.50) is a collection of 
twelve fantasy stories, mostly 
done in the modern, non-Gothic 
style whose most consistent ap- 
pearance was in the early 1940’s 
magazine Unknown. That jour- 
nal, as some of you know, was for 
a long time after its demise 
known as “the late, lamented Vn- 
known,” by fond readers who 
found it considerably more to 
their liking than the involuted 
morbidity of the Victorian school 
which had given rise to such 
screamers as Dtacula and, from 
another branch of the same night- 
nlossoming cereus, Frankenstein. 
Unknown itself was the stable- 
mate of Astounding, and partook 
if the sometimes-cheeky, always 
10 -nonsense engineering view of 
ts story problems. Vampires 
were dealt with in terms of their 
unction, not their subconscious 
symbolic implications; if a human 
nctim happened to be unavail- 
ible, a quick raid on the local 
lospital’s blood bank would do 
ust as well, and even the vam- 
jires agreed it was much neater. 
There’s a lot to be said for it as 



a source of entertainment, and 
not for a moment should you be- 
lieve that all of it left you laugh- 
ing. Those of you who have not 
had much truck with fantasy will 
find some stories here that are 
so good they couldn’t possibly 
be that stuff you don’t like. 
Those of you who have been hop- 
ing for just one more issue of 
Unknown have now found a close 
approximation of it, with some 
skillful editorial handling and 
footnoting by Knight, a story of 
whose own would not have been 
omitted by any other editor. 

Three of the stories are from 
Unknown: “They,” by Robert 
Heinlein; “Trouble With Water,” 
by H.L. Gold, and “It,” by Theo- 
dore Sturgeon. “Trouble With 
Water” is very funny; “They” 
and “It” are not. “They” attacks 
the same place Philip K. Dick 
was getting at in The Three Stig- 
mata of Palmer Eldritch, and 
“It” is a moody, horripilating and 
masterfully told story about a 
thing that just came to life in the 
woods one day. There is a Ray 
Bradbury story, “The Black Fer- 
ris,” a fantasy built around the 
use of a carnival ferris wheel as 
a sort of time machine; there is 
Anthony Boucher’s very short, 
very snappy story which I think 
is the last word in how to come 
out winners if you make a deal 
with a demon, “Nellthu.” Among 
favorites are “Casey Agonistes”

by Richard McKenna, who could 
tell a masculine and yet tender 
story as well as anyone I’ve ever 
read, and T.L. Sherred’s “Eye 
For Iniquity,” which is about a 
man who could literally make 
money by just thinking about it. 
That latter story, by the way, is 
from Beyond, Galaxy's late, la- 
mented stablemate of the early 
1950’s. There is not a disappoint- 
ing story in this book; there are 
few which anyone who likes mod- 
ern science fiction would not en- 
joy just as well and, in some 
moods, better. I wish someone 
would do something about that. 

HT' he Eighth Galaxy Reader, 
■*- Edited and with an introduc- 
tion by Frederik Pohl (Double- 
day, $3.95), is a collection of 
twelve stories from this magazine, 
their copyright dates ranging up 
from 1961. 

In the order of their appear- 
ance in the book they are “Comic 
Inferno” by Brian Aldiss; “The 
Big Engine,” by Fritz Leiber; “A 
Day on Death Highway” by 
Chandler Elliott; “The End of 
The Race” by Albert Bermel; 
“The Lonely Man” by Theodore 
Thomas; “A Bad Day for Ver- 
min” by Keith Laumer; “Dawn- 
ingsburgh” by Wallace West; 
“And All the Earth a Grave” by 
C.C. MacApp; “Hot Planet” by 
H al Clement; “Final Encounter” 
by Harry Harrison; “If There 



Were No Benny Cemoli” by 
Philip K. Dick and “Critical 
Mass” by Frederik Pohl and C. 
M. Kornbluth. 

Among them you will find 
science fiction writing of nearly 
every kind, ranging from the Al- 
diss, which is heavily influenced 
by the Kingsley Amis critical 
construct of the same name, 
through such plain statements of 
picque with our society as the 
Elliott, the Bermel, the Laumer, 
and the MacApp, and on to 
“straight” sf like “Hot Planet.” 
Fritz Leiber’s story is a fine 
mood-builder about the wheels 
that really make the world go 
’round. “The Lonely Man” is a 
very well done character study ol 
an engineering genius; Thomas 
has authored quite an accumu- 
lation of quietly good stories 
with staying power — I’ve re-read 
this one several times with con- 
siderable pleasure. Philip K. 
Dick’s story is, as usual, marked- 
ly individual, and distinguished 
for his ability to draw fine-line 
social caricatures paradoxically 
freighted with verisimilitude; 
ditto the Pohl 8s Kornbluth story. 
I would say the book as whole 
reflects a sense which is best 
summed-up in Harry Harrison’s 
story about an exploration team 
searching, against the weight of 
accumulating loneliness, for other 
races in this galaxy. They find 
one, at last, and deal with it in- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF

telligentiy, but not without some 
confusion and apprehension. Nor 
are the members of the team 
themselves quite human as we 
understand the term at this 
young point in our development. 
And the aliens, it turns out at the 
story’s climax, are not truly alien, 
but are other men, evolved from 
ourselves, who long ago set out 
exploring and became separated 
from the branches of humanity 
represented by the team. If there 
is disappointment in this isolated 
thing, there is much to be proud 
of in many others, and there is 
the mutual purpose of, now, go- 
ing exploring together in the other 
galaxies that lie beyond our own. 

There is this sense in this book, 
as I said, that modern science 
fiction reflects a dissatisfaction 
with things as they are, some- 
times to the verge of indignation, 
but also retains optimism about 
the eventual outcome. There is 



something rather deeper than the 
recurrent strain in the “Golden 
Age” science fiction of the 1940’s 
— the implication that sheer tech- 
nological accomplishment would 
solve all the problems, hooray, 
and that all the problems were 
what they seemed to be on the 
surface. There is no overall easy 
answer among the stories in this 
book, and not many of them at- 
tempt to deal with problems larg- 
er than those in the immediate 
story situation, but collected in 
this way they show writers and 
writing which have gotten mark- 
edly farther up the road toward 
tackling hard questions in honest 
ways. Sometimes it’s not done 
more than adequate. Sometimes 
it’s done tongue-in-cheek, some- 
times it’s done heart-on-sleeve. 
But it’s done, and it’s encouraging 
to see, and I expect most of you 
will agree it’s worth reading.
