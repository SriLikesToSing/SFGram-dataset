THE DISMAL SCIENCE 


6i/ 8 'he dismal «cience” is what 
Robert Theobald (that’s 
the economist , Robert Theobald) 
calls economics . because, he 
says, economics is properly the 
study of the allocation of scarce 
resources, its basic principles de- 
cided when things like the world 
supply of food and the world 
supply of people to eat it were 
considered fixed (in a stable pro- 
portion of slightly more people 
than there was food to feed 
them), and now we know ways 
of making things abundant. 

We hear a lot of this dismal 
science, from some pretty dis- 
mal scientists. “Let’s give up the 
space race so we can put the 
money into a cure for cancer.” 
“We can’t afford a war on pov- 
erty while we’re fighting a war 
in Vietnam.” Etc. These are 
things you hear from people who 
consider themselves rational and 
authoritative (well, that’s a 
tautology; it would have been 
enough to say “from people”), 
and if you ask why, they reply 
crushingly, “It’s economically 
impossible to do both!” 

Fact is, it isn’t . and if it 
were, it would be irrelevant. 

At this moment in time there 
is a great deal of abundance in 
the world, particularly in the 


United States; and if we don’t 
breed ourselves into squalor, 
there’s every chance that there 
will soon be more. Abundantly 
more. It may be true, in a nar- 
row budgetary sense, that we 
can’t “afford” some of the things 
we do, but, as Harold Urey 
points out in a recent Bulletin of 
the Atomic Scientists, the Egyp- 
tians couldn’t “afford” to build 
the Pyramids and the Middle 
Ages certainly couldn’t “afford^ 
building their breathtaking ca- 
thedrals — but if they hadn’t 
gone ahead and built them any- 
way, all of us coming later 
would have been a little the 
poorer for the lack of them. 

And, of course, the way in 
which the arguments would be 
irrelevant, even if true, lies in the 
fact that the sort of resources 
used in one project have little 
application to the needs of an- 
other. Taking a spacecraft-build- 
ing project away from McDonnel 
Aviation wouldn’t free one scien- 
tist or one machine for use in 
the biochemistry labs. All that 
is diverted is that abstraction 
(at least its an abstraction 
in macroscopic, governmental 
terms) called" money. But there 
is not any such thing as a fixed, 
scarce resource of money. There

SCIENTOLOGY SOLVES ALL THE MYSTERIES 


A mystery is only a lack of knowledge or 
answers. Personal knowledge can be 
acquired on any subject. Scientology is 
the modern day applied philosophy, but 
its traditions can be traced back much 
earlier than Greece. Scientology can 
answer any question you have about 
yourself, your mind, life and the uni- 
verse. Scientology solves all the 
mysteries. For example, Scientology 
solves the mystery of who is the source 
of your decisions. You are. You are 
the source of your daily decisions. 
And the only knowledge you have to 
base your decisions on is knowledge 
you have gained. Through Scientology 
you can know about anything.

is whatever quantity of money 
a stable government elects to 
issue. The stabler the govern- 
ment, the less chancy the print- 
ing of extra currency issues be- 
comes; and in the long run the 
stablest governments are prob- 
ably those which do the most 
things that their citizens want. 

Oh, there’s no doubt an up- 
per limit somewhere to what 
can be done. But it’s doubt- 
ful that we’re very near it. Not 
as long as there is a single man 
unemployed or underemployed, 
or a single machine not operated 
at full capacity, anyway. 

So the dismal science is for 
dismal people. If it’s worth our 
while to put men in space, we can 
put men in space; if it’s worth 
our while to build a thousand 
new hospitals, we can build a 
thousand new hospitals — and 
fight poverty and N. Vietnam- 
ese, and fund cancer research. 

/^\f course, if you would like 
to see a national budget in 
balance, for some reason of artis- 
tic principle, say, or because you 
just like things nice and tidy, 
you might want to cut out some 
items to make room for others. 

We have a suggestion on where 
some good cuts might be made 
— and this is a Galaxy first; 
we’ve never seen this suggestion 
made by anyone before, and yet 
it seems to us so natural. 


Where to cut the United States 
national budget? Why, in the 
second biggest item it contains: 
interest on the national debt. 

Did you ever stop to think 
of why governments borrow 
money from their own people? 
Not because it increases the sup- 
ply of money available to them; 
remember, they make the sup- 
ply themselves. Not because 
they’re afraid the oil company 
will halt fuel for the President’s 
jet because of non-payment. 

They borrow the money only 
because they don’t want it spent 
by the people they borrow it 
from. Why don’t they want it 
spent? Because that would be 
inflationary. In short, they pay 
a bribe to prevent inflation to 
such an extent that the bribe 
itself, the interest payment, 
reaches such staggering propor- 
tions that it becomes the second 
biggest item in the government’s 
own balance sheet . and thus 
itself becomes inflationary. 

Now, there’s where real econo- 
my in government spending is 
possible. But we don’t think it 
will come about, we must admit. 

It will fail for lack of public 
support. Oh, some people might 
vote for it, given a chance. But 
we guarantee that none of them 
will be the people who now so 
passionately demand economy in 
government spending ....

MIRROR OF ICE 

by GARY WRIGHT 


When your sled goes wild you 
always have one escape still 
open — even if if kills you! 


nphey called it The Stuka. 
1 It was a tortuous, twenty- 
kilometer path of bright ice, and 
in that distance — 12.42 miles — 
it dropped 7,366 feet, carving a 
course down the alpine moun- 
tainside like the track of a great 
snake. It was thirty feet wide on 
the straights with corners curling 
as high forty feet. It was made 
for sleds. 

He waited in the narrow cock- 
pit and listened to the wind. It 
moaned along the frozen shoul- 
der of the towering white peak 
and across the steep starting 
ramp, pushing along streamers 
of snow out against the hard blue 
sky, and he could hear it cry 


inside him with the same cold 
and lonely sound. 

He was scared. And what was 
worse — he knew it. 

Forward, under the sleek nose 
of his sled, the mountain fell 
away abruptly — straight down, 
it seemed — and the valley was 
far below. So very far. 

. too far this time, buddy- 
boy, too far forever . 

The countdown light on the 
dash flickered a sudden blood 
red, then deliberately winked 
twice. At the same time two red 
rockets arced out over the valley 
and exploded into twin crimson 
fireballs. 

Two minutes. 


45 


On. both sides of the starting 
ramp, cantilevered gracefully 
from the mountainside, brightly 
bannered platforms were crowd- 
ed with people. He glanced at the 
hundreds of blankly staring sun- 
glasses, always the same, always 
turned to the ramp as if trying 
to see inside the helmets of these 
men, as if trying to pry into the 
reasons of their being there wait- 
ing to die. He looked back to 
the deep valley; today he won- 
dered too. 

. just one last time, wasn’t 
that what you told yourself? One 
last race and that’s the end of 
it and good-by to the sleds and 
thank God! Wasn’t that your 
personal promise? 

Then what in hell are you do- 
ing here? That “last race” was 
last month’s race. Why are you 
in this one? 

No answer. 

All he could find inside were 
cold questions and a hollow echo 
of the wind. He gripped the 
steering wheel, hard, until cramps 
began in his hands; he would 
think about his sled .... 

I t was his eleventh sled, and like 
the others it was a brilliant 
red, not red for its particular 
flash, but because of a possible 
crash far from the course in deep 
snow. He wanted to be found 
and found fast. Some of the Kin 
had never been found in time. 

46 


. they didn’t find Bob Lan- 
der until that summer — 

He forced himself back. 
Empty, the sled weighed 185 
pounds and looked very much 
like the body-shell of a particu- 
larly sleek racer but with a full 
bubble canopy and with runners 
instead of wheels. It was a mean- 
looking missile, low and lean, 
hardly wider than his shoulders, 
clearing the ice by barely two 
inches. He sat nearly reclining, 
the half wheel in his lap, feet 
braced on the two edging pedals 
— and this was the feature that 
made these sleds the awesome 
things they were. They could tilt 
their runners — four hollow- 
ground, chrome-steel “skis” — 
edging them against the ice like 
wide skate blades. This was what 
had changed bobsledding into 
. this: this special thing with 
its special brotherhood, this clan 
apart, this peculiar breed of men 
set aside for the wonder of other 
men. The Kin, they called them- 
selves. 

. someone once, laughing, 
had said, “Without peer, we are 
the world’s fastest suicides.” 

He snapped himself back 
again and checked his brakes. 

By pulling back on the wheel, 
two electrically operated flaps — 
actually halves of the sled’s tail 
section — swung out on either 
side. Silly to see, perhaps. But 
quite effective when this twelve 

GALAXY 


and a half square feet hit the 
airstream at eighty mph. A but- 
ton under his right thumb oper- 
ated another braking system: 
with each push it fired forward 
a solid rocket charge in the nose 
of the sled. There were seven 
charges, quite often not enough. 
But when everything failed, in- 
cluding the man, there was the 
lever by his left hip. The Final 
Folly, it was called; a firm pull 
and, depending on a hundred un- 
known “if’s” and “maybe’s,” he 
might be lucky enough to find 
himself hanging from a para- 
chute some 300 feet up. Or it' 
might be the last voluntary act 
of his life. 

He had used it twice. Once 
steaking into the tall wall of the 
Wingover, he had lost a runner 
. and was almost fired into 
the opposite grandstand, missing 
the top tier of seats by less than 
four feet. Another time six sleds 
suddenly tangled directly in front 
of him, and he had blasted him- 
self through the over-hanging 
limbs of a large fir tree. 

But others had not been so 
lucky. 

ans Kroger: they finally dug 
his body out of eighteen 
feet of snow ; he’d gone all the 
way to the dirt. His sled had been 
airborne when he blew — and 
upside-down! 

Jarl Yorgensen: his sled tum-

bling and he ejected directly un- 
der the following sleds. No one 
was certain that all of him was 
ever found! 

Max Conrad: a perfect blow- 
out! At least 350 feet up and 
slightly downhill . His chute 
never opened. 

Wayne Barley: — 

He jarred himself hard in the 
cockpit and felt the sudden 
seizure of his G-suit. He wanted 
to hit something. But he could 
feel the watching eyes and the 
TV cameras, and there wasn’t 
room in the cockpit to get a de- 
cent swing anyway. 

His countdown light flickered 
for attention and blinked once, 
and a single red rocket flashed 
into the sky. 

One minute — God, had time 
stopped? 

But that was part of it all : the 
waiting, the God-awful waiting, 
staring down at the valley over 
a mile below. And how many 
men had irrevocably slammed 
back their canopy in this lifetime 
of two minutes and stayed be- 
hind? A few, yes. And he could 
too. Simply open his canopy, that 
was the signal, and when the 
start came the other sleds would 
dive down and away and he 
would be sitting here alone. But, 
God, so alone! And he would be 
alone for the rest of his life. He 
might see some of the Kin again, 
sometime, somewhere. But they 

47 



would not see him. It was a kind 
of death to stay behind. 

. and a real death to go. 
Death, the silent rider with every 
man in every race . 

He frowned at the other sleds, 
sixteen in staggered rows of eight. 
Sixteen bright and beautiful, trim 
fast projectiles hanging from 
their starting clamps. He knew 
them, every one; they were his 
brothers. They were the Kin — 
but not here. Not now. 

Years ago when he was a nov- 
ice he had asked old Franz Cash- 
ner, “Did you see the way I took 
Basher Bend right beside you?” 
And Franz told him, “Up there 
I see nobody! Only sleds! Down 
here you are you, up there you 
are nothing but another sled. 
That’s all! And don’t forget that! 
That’s all! And don’t forget 
that!” 

. and it had to be that way. 
On the course sleds crashed and 
were no more .... Only later, 
in the valley, were there men 
missing. 

/^vf these sixteen, chances were 
that nine would finish. With 
luck, maybe ten. And chances 
also said that only fourteen of 
these men would be alive tonight. 
Those were the odds, as hard and 
cold as the ice, the fascinating 
frosting for this sport. Vio- 
lent death! Assured, spectacular, 
magnetic death in a sport such 
48 


as the world had never known. 
Incredible men with incredible 
skills doing an incredible thing. 

Back in the Sixties they claim- 
ed an empty sled with its steering 
locked would make a course all 
by itself. An empty sled here 
would not last two corners. The 
Stuka was a cold killer, not a 
thrill ride. And it was not par- 
ticular. It killed veterans and 
novices alike. But there was 
$20,000 for the man who got to 
the end of it first, and a whole 
month before he had to do it 
again. Money and fame and all 
the girls in the world. Everything 
and anything for the men who 
rode the Stuka. 

Was that why they did it? 

. yes, always that question: 
“ Why do you do it?” And be- 
fore he had died on the Plummet, 
Sir Robert Brooke had told them, 
"Well, why not?” 

And it was an answer as good 
as any. 

But was it good enough this 
time? 

No answer. 

He only knew there was but 
one way off this mountain for 
him now and that was straight 
ahead, and for the first time since 
his novice runs, his legs were 
trembling. Twelve and a half 
miles, call it, and the record was 
9 minutes, 1.14 seconds! An aver- 
age speed of 82.67 mph, and that 
was his record. They would at 

GALAXY 


least remember him by that! 

His countdown light flashed, a 
green rocket rose and burst, and 
there was a frozen moment . 
the quiet click of the release hook, 
the lazy, slow-motion start, the 
sleds sliding forward in formation 
over the edge . then he was 
looking once again into the ter- 
rible top of the Stuka — that 
45 -degree, quarter-mile straight 
drop. In six seconds he was do- 
ing over 60 mph, and the mouth 
of the first corner was reaching 
up. 

. Carl’s Corner, for Carl 
Rasch, who went over the top of 
it nine years ago; and they found 
him a half-mile down the glacier 
. what was left of him . 

H e glanced to his right. It was 
clear. He eased his flap 
brakes, dropped back slightly 
and pulled right. The leading 
sleds were jockeying in front 
now, lining for this long left. 
Brakes flapped like quick wings, 
and they started around, sleds 
riding up the vertical ice wall 
and holding there, ice chips 
spraying back like contrails from 
those on the lower part of the 
wall as they edged their runners 
against the turn. He came in far 
right and fast, riding high on the 
wall and diving off with good ac- 
celeration. 

The ice was a brilliant blur un- 
derneath now, and he could feel 

MIRROR OF ICE 


the trembling rumble of his sled. 
They rattled into the Chute, a 
steep traverse, still gaining speed, 
still bunched and jostling for 
position. He was in the rear but 
this was good; he didn’t like this 
early crowding for the corners. 

The sheer wall of Basher Bend 
loomed, a 120-degree right that 
dropped hard coming out. He 
was following close in the slip- 
stream of the sled in front of 
him, overtaking because of the 
lessened wind resistance. The 
corner came, and they were on 
the wall again. With his slightly 
greater speed he was able to go 
higher on the wall, nearly to the 
top and above the other sled. His 
G-suit tightened. They swarmed 
out of the comer and into the 
Strafing Run, a long, steep dive 
with a hard pull-out. 

A roar rose from the moun- 
tain now as the sleds reached 
speed, a dull rumble like that of 
avalanche . and that is actually 
what they were now — an 
avalanche of sleds, and just as 
deadly. 

He pulled ahead of the other 
sled in the dive and hit the 
savage pull-out right on the tail 
of another, and the next turn 
curved up before them : Hell’s 
Left, a double corner, an abrupt 
left falling into a short straight 
with another sharp left at the 
bottom. He was still overtaking, 
and* they went up the wall side 

49 


Dy side, He on tne inside, under 
the other. He eased his left pedal, 
using edges for the first time, 
holding himself away from the 
other by a safe six inches. The 
course dropped away, straight 
down the mountain to the second 
half of the corner, and he felt 
the sickening sudden smoothness 
of leaving the ice — he had tried 
it too fast, and the course was 
falling away under him. 

. old Rolf De Kepler, “ The 
Flying Dutchman,” laughing over 
his beer and saying, “Always I 
am spending more time off the 
ice than on, hah? So this is more 
easy to my stomach. Already I 
have four G-suits to give up on 
me. 

. and he had made his last 
flight three years ago off the top 
at the bottom of Hell’s Left . 
400 yards, they claimed. 

H e held firm and straight on 
the wheel and pulled care- 
fully, barely opening his brakes. 
The sled touched at a slight 
angle, lurched, but he caught it 
by edging quickly. The other sled 
had pulled ahead. He tucked in 
behind it. The second left was 
rushing up at them, narrow and 
filled with sleds. They dove into 
it less than a foot apart. Ice 
chips streamed back from edging 
runners, rattling against his sled 
like a storm of bullets. There was 
an abrupt lurching, the quick 
50 


left-right slam of air turbulence. 
A sled was braking hard some- 
where ahead. Perhaps two or 
three. Where? He couldn’t see. 
He reacted automatically . 
full air brakes, hard onto his left 
edges and steer for the inside; 
the safest area if a wreck was 
trying to happen. His sled shiver- 
ed with the strain of coming off 
the wall, holding against the 
force of the corner now only with 
the knifelike edges of its run- 
ners. But the force was too great. 
He began to skid, edges chatter- 
ing. He eased them off a little, 
letting the sled drift slightly side- 
ways. Two others had sliced 
down to the inside too, edges 
spraying ice. For a moment he 
was blinded again, but the corner 
twisted out flat, and he was 
through and still on the course, 
and he knew he was too tight, too 
hard with his control; he was 
fighting his sled instead of work- 
ing with it ... 

... a tourist once asked Erik 
Sigismund how he controlled his 
sled, and he answered, “Barely.” 
And even that had failed when 
he flipped it a year ago and four 
others ran over him. 

An old, lurking thought 
pounced into him again ... he 
couldn’t stop this sled now if he 
wanted to. There was no such 
thing as stopping, outside of a 
crash. He had to ride until it 
ended, and he was suddenly cer- 

GALAXY 


tain that was not going to be at 
the bottom. Not this time. He 
had crashed before, too many 
times, but he had never had this 
feeling of fear before. Not this 
fear. It was different, and he 
couldn’t say why, and he was 
letting it affect him. And that 
was the greatest wrong. 

They were thundering into the 
Jackhammer now, 300 yards of 
violent dips. Every sled had its 
brakes out, and there were fast 
flashes as some fired braking 
rockets. But where the walls of 
the course sloped upward the ice 
was comparatively smooth. He 
eased left, to the uphill side, and 
leaned on his left pedal, holding 
the sled on the slope with its 
edges. Then he folded his air 
brakes and started gaining again. 
It was necessary; one did not 
hold back from fear. If that was 
one’s style of life, he would never 
be a sledder in the first place. 

S uddenly from the middle of 
the leading blurs a sled be- 
came airborne from the crest of 
one of the bumps. It hit once 
and twisted into the air like 
something alive. Sleds behind it 
fired rockets and tried to edge 
away. One skidded broadside, 
then rolled. A shattered body 
panel spun away; the two 
sleds were demolishing them- 
selves. Someone blew-out, streak- 
ing into the sky, canopy spark - 
MIRROR OF ICE 


ling high in the sun — and that 
meant another sled out of con- 
trol. He pulled full air brakes and 
fired a rocket, the force slam- 
ming him hard against his chest 
straps. His left arm was ready 
to fire the charge under the seat. 
But if he waited too long .... 

. Kurt Schnabel was proud 
to be the only man who had 
never ejected . but the one 
time he had tried he had waited 
the barest fraction of a moment 
too long, and his chute came 
down with his shattered corpse. 

The three wild sleds whirled 
away, spinning out of sight over 
the low retaining walls. He fold- 
ed his brakes. There was a 
trembling in his arms and legs 
like the slight but solid shudder- 
ing of a flywheel out of balance, 
involuntary and with a threat of 
getting worse. He cursed him- 
self. He could have blown-out 
too. No one would have blamed 
him with that tangle developing 
in front. But he hadn’t . and 
it was too late now. 

. only one man had ever 
blown-out without an apparent 
reason and gotten away with it: 
Shorty Case in his first race. 
And when he was asked about it 
afterwards, asked in that over 
casual, quiet tone, he had answer- 
ed, “You bet your sweet, I blew! 
’Cause if I hadn’t, man, I was 
gonna pee my pants!” 

But he didn’t blow-out that 

51 


day on the Fallaways, the day 
his sled somersaulted and sowed 
its wreckage down the course for 
a half mile . and him too . 

No, there were no quitters 
here; only the doers or the dead. 
And which was he going to be 
tonight? 

. drive, don't think . 

The Jackhammer smoothed out 
and plunged downward, and 
they were hurtling now into the 
Wingover at over 90 mph. Here 
were the second biggest grand- 
stands on the course, the second 
greatest concentration of cam- 
eras. 

Here two ambulance heli- 
copters stood by, and a priest too. 
The Wingover .... 

I magine an airplane peeling off 
into a dive . imagine a sled 
doing the same on a towering 
wall of ice, a wall rising like a 
great, breaking wave, frozen at 
the moment of its overhanging 
curl .... The Wingover was a 
monstrous, curving scoop to the 
right, nearly fifty feet high, roll- 
ing the sleds up, over, and hurl- 
ing them down into a 65 degree 
pitch when twisted into a 6-G 
pull-out to the left. 

. “Impossible!” When Wil- 
frid von Gerlach laid out the 
Stuka that is what they told him 
about the Wingover. “It cannot 
be done!” 

But von Gerlach had been a 
52 


Gran Prix racer and a stunt pilot , 
and when the Stuka was finished 
he took the first sled through. At 
the finish he sat quietly for a 
moment, staring back at the 
mountain. “At the Wingover I 
was how fast?” he asked thought- 
fully. They replied that he’d been 
radared there at 110 mph. He 
nodded, then made the state- 
ment the sledders had carried 
with them ever since. 

“It’s possible.” 

He watched the leading sleds 
line up for that shining, sheer 
curve and felt the fear freeze 
through him again. A man was 
little more than a captive in his 
sled here. If he was on the right 
line going in, then it was beauti- 
ful; if not, well .... 

. the brotherly beers and 
the late talk . 

“Remember when Otto Do- 
magk left Cripple’s Corner in 
that snow storm?” 

“ Ya , und ven him vas digged 
out — Fas? Two hours? — he 
vas so sleeping.” 

“And not a mark on him, re- 
member?” 

. Remember, remember . 
He followed in line barely four 
feet from the sled in front of him 
and felt the savage, sickening 
blow as the wall raised and roll- 
ed him. A flicker of shadow, a 
glimpse of the valley nearly up- 
sidedown, then the fall and the 
increasing shriek of wind and 

GALAXY 


runners, and he was pointing per- 
fectly into the pull-out, still lined 
exactly with the sled ahead — 
but there was one sled badly out 
of line ... 

And someone pulled their air 
brakes full open. 

S leds began weaving in the 
violent turbulence of those 
brakes. Rockets flashed. A sled 
went sideways, rolling lazily 
above the others, and exploded 
against the wall of the pullout. 
He pulled the ejection lever . 
nothing happened! 

He was dead, he knew that. 
He saw two sleds tumbling into 
the sky, another shattered to 
pieces and sliding along the 
course. All that was necessary 
was to hit one of those pieces . 
but the corner was suddenly gone 
behind. The course unwound in- 
to a long left traverse. He remem- 
bered to breathe. There were 
tooth chips in his mouth and the 
taste of blood. He swerved past 
a piece of wreckage, then anoth- 
er .. 

. how many were dead now? 
Himself and how many others? 
But it wasn't fear of death — 
what was it? What was it that 
he’d walled off inside — that 
something secret always skirted 
as carefully as a ship veers from 
a hidden reef, knowing it is there 
— what? And now the wall was 
down, and he was facing .... 
MIRROR OF ICE 


His sled shuddered. He was 
driving badly, too harsh with his 
edge control. He narrowly made 
it through the Boot and Cripple’s 
Corner, spraying ice behind him, 
but it was not the sled that was 
out of control. It was him. And 
he was diving now straight for 
the gates of hell at over 110 mph. 

It was called the Plummet. It 
began with an innocent, wide left, 
steeply banked, then the world 
fell away. It dove over a half 
mile headlong down a 50-degree 
slope straight into a ravine and 
up the other side, then into a full 
180-degree uphill hairpin to the 
right, a steep straight to the bot- 
tom of the ravine again, and fi- 
nally into a sharp left and a 
long, rolling straight. It had kill- 
ed more men than any other part 
of the course. 

Here were the biggest grand- 
stands and the most hungry eyes 
of the cameras. Here there were 
three clergy, and emergency 
operating rooms. Here . 

. here he would complete 
the formality of dying. 

H e came into the left too low, 
too fast for the edges to 
hold. The sled skidded. He 
reacted automatically, holding 
slight left edges and steering into 
the skid. The sled drifted up the 
wall, arcing toward the top where 
nothing showed but the cold blue 
of the sky. He waited, a part of 

53 


him almost calm now, waiting to 
see if the corner would straighten 
before he went over the top. It 
did, but he was still skidding, 
close to the retaining wall, plung- 
ing into the half-mile drop near- 
ly sideways. He increased his 
edges. The tail of the sled brush- 
ed the wall and it was suddenly 
swinging the opposite way. He 
revsersed his wheel and edges, an- 
ticipating another skid, but he 
was not quick enough. The sled 
bucked, careening up on its left 
runners. It grazed the wall again, 
completely out of control now — 
but he kept trying . 

. and that was it; you kept 
trying. Over and over. No matter 
how many times you faced your- 
self it had to be done again. And 
again. The Self was never satis- 
fied with single victories — you 
had to keep trying . 

And he was empty no more. 


T he hospital. How many times 
had he awakened here? And 
it was always wonderfully the 
same: gentle warmth and his 
body finally relaxed and he 
would test it piece by piece to 
see what was bent and broken 
this time; and always the news- 
men and the writers and the 
other assorted ghouls, and always 
the question and answer period. 
Punchlining, they called it ... 
“How did it happen?” 

“I dozed off.” 

“Why didn’t you eject?” 
“Parachuting is dangerous.” 
“When did you realize you 
were out of control?” 

“At the starting line.” 

“What will you do now?” 
“Heal.” 

“Will you race again?” 

. “It’s possible.” 

Outside, the wind was blowing.

POLITY AND CUSTOM OF THE CAMIROI 

b / R. A. LAFFERTY 


The committee had come to learn 
Camiroi customs — but they didn't 
know they'd have to learn so fast! 


F rom Report of Field Group 
for Examination of Off -Earth 
Customs and Codexes to the 
Council for Governmental Reno- 
vation and Legal Rethinking. 
Taken from the day-book of Paul 
Piggott, political analyst. 


Making appointments with the 
Camiroi is proverbally like build- 
ing with quicksilver. We discov- 
ered this early. But they do have 
the most advanced civilization of 
any of the four human worlds. 
And we did have a firm invitation 
to visit the planet Camiroi and 
to investigate customs. And we 
had the promise that we would 
be taken in hand immediately on 
our arrival by a group parallel to 
our own. 


But there was no group to meet 
us at the Sky-Port. 

“Where is the Group for the 
Examination of Customs and Co- 
dexes?” we asked the girl who was 
on duty as Information Factor at 
the Sky-Port. 

“Ask that post over there,” she 
said. She was a young lady of 
mischievous and almost rakish 
mien. 

“I hope we are not reduced to 
talking to posts,” said our leader 
Charles Chosky, “but I see that it 
is some sort of communicating de- 
vice. Does the post talk English, 
young lady?” 

“The post understands the fifty 
languages that all Camiroi know,” 
the young lady said. “On Camiroi, 
even the dogs speak fifty lan- 
guages. Speak to it.” 


55 


“I’ll try it,” said Mr. Chosky. 
“Ah, post, we were to be taken in 
hand by a group parallel to our 
own. Where can we find the 
Group for the Examination of 
Customs and Codexes?” 

“Duty! Duty!” cried the post 
in a girlish voice that was some- 
how familiar. “Three for a group! 
Come, come, be constituted!” 
“I’ll be one,” said a pleasant- 
looking Camiroi, striding over. 

“I’ll be another,” said a teen- 
age sprouting boy of the same 
species. 

“One more, one more!” cried 
the post. “Oh, here comes my re- 
lief. I’ll be the other one to form 
the group. Come, come, let’s get 
started. What do you want to 
see first, good people?” 

“How can a post be a member 
of an ambulatory group?” 
Charles Chosky asked. 

“Oh, don’t be quaint,” said the 
girl who had been the informa- 
tion factor and also the voice of 
the post. She had come up behind 
us and joined us. “Sideki and 
Nautes, we become a group for 
cozening Earthlings,” she said. “I 
am sure you heard the rather 
humorous name they gave it.” 
“Are you as a group qualified 
to give us the information we 
seek?” I asked. 

“Every citizen of Camiroi is 
qualified, in theory, to give sound 
information on every subject,” 
said the teen-age sproutling. 


“But in practice It may not be 
so,” I said, my legal mind fasten- 
ing onto his phrase. 

“The only difficulty is our over- 
liberal admission to citizenship,” 
said Miss Diayggeia, who had 
been the voice of the post and the 
information factor. “Any person 
may become a citizen of Camiroi 
if he has resided here for one 
oodle. Once it was so that only 
natural leaders traveled space, 
and they qualified. Now, how- 
ever, there are subsidized persons 
of no ability who come. They do 
not always conform to our high 
standard of reason and informa- 
tion.” 

“Thanks,” said our Miss Holly 
Holm, “and how long is an 
oodle?” 

“About fifteen minutes,” said 
Miss Dia. “The post will register 
you now if you wish.” 

The post registered us, and we 
became citizens of Camiroi. 

“Well, come, come, fellow citi- 
zens, what can we do for you?” 
asked Sideki, the pleasant-look- 
ing Camiroi who was the first 
member of our host group. 

“Our reports of the laws of 
Camiroi seem to be a mixture of 
travelers’ tales and nonsense,” I 
said. “We want to find how a 
Camiroi law is made and how it 
works.” 

“So, make one, citizens, and see 
how it works,” said Sideki. “You 
are now citizens like any other 


56 


GALAXY 


citizens, and any three of you can 
band together and make a law. 
Let us go down to Archives and 
enact it. And you be thinking 
what sort of law it will be as we 
go there.” 

"life strode through the con- 
’ ' trived and beautiful park- 
lands and groves which were the 
roofs of Camiroi City. The extent 
was full of fountains and water- 
falls, and streams with bizarre 
bridges over them. Some were 
better than others. Some were 
better than anything we had ever 
seen anywhere. 

“But I believe that I myself 
could design a pond and weir as 
good as this one,” said Charles 
Chosky, our leader. “And I’d have 
some of those bushes that look 
like Earth sumac in place of that 
cluster there; and I’d break up 
that pattern of rocks and tilt the 
layered massif behind it, and 
bring in a little of that blue 
moss — ” 

“You see your duty quickly, 
Citizen,” said Sideki: “You 

should do all this before this very 
day is gone. Make it the way you 
think best, and remove the plaque 
that is there. Then you can dic- 
tate your own plaque to any of 
the symbouleutik posts, and it 
will be made and set in. ‘My 
composition is better than your 
composition,’ is the way most 
plaques read, and sometimes a 


scenery composer will add some- 
thing humorous like ‘and my dog 
can whip your dog.’ You can 
order all necessary materials from 
that same post there, and most 
citizens prefer to do the work 
with their own hands. This sys- 
tem works for gradual improve- 
ment. There are many Consensus 
Masterpieces that remain year 
after year; and the ordinary work 
is subject to constant turnover. 
There, for instance, is a tree 
which was not there this morning 
and Which should not be there 
tonight. I’m sure that one of you 
can design a better tree.” 

“I can,” said Miss Holly, “and 
I will do so today.” 

We descended from the roof 
parklands into the lower streets 
of Camiroi City, and went to Arc- 
hives. 

“Have you thought of a new 
law yet?” Miss Dia asked when 
we were at Archives. “We don’t 
expect brilliance from such new 
citizens, but we ask you not to be 
ridiculous.” 

Our leader Charles Chosky 
drew himself up to full height and 
spoke : 

“We promulgate a law that a 
permanent group be set up on 
Camiroi to oversee and devise 
regulations for all random and 
hasty citizens’ groups with the 
aim of making them more respon- 
sible, and that a full-scale review 
of such groups he held yearly.” 


POLITY AND CUSTOMS OF THE CAMIROI 


57 


“Got it?” Miss Dia called to 
an apparatus there in Archives. 

“Got it,” said the device. It 
ground its entrails, and coughed 
up the law inscribed on bronze, 
and set it in a law niche. 

“The echo is deafening,” said 
our Miss Holly, pretending to 
listen. 

“Yes. What is the effect of 
what we have done?” I asked. 

“Oh, the law is in effect,” said 
young Nautes. “It has been 
weighed and integrated into the 
corpus of laws. It is already con- 
sidered in the instructions that 
the magistrate coming on duty in 
a short time (usually a citizen 
will serve as magistrate for one 
hour a month) must scan before 
he takes his seat. Possibly in this 
session he will assess somebody 
guilty of a misdemeanor to think 
about this problem for ten min- 
utes and then to attach an en- 
abling act to your law.” 

“But what if some citizens’ 
group passes a silly law?” our 
Miss Holly asked. 

“They do it often. One of them 
has just done so. But it will be 
repealed quickly enough,” said 
Miss Dia of the Camiroi. “Any 
citizen who has his name on three 
laws deemed silly by general con- 
sensus Shall lose his citizenship 
for one year. A citizen who so 
loses his citizenship twice shall 
be mutilated, and the third time 
he shall be killed. This isn’t an 


extreme ruling. By that time he 
would have participated in nine 
silly laws. Surely that’s enough.” 

ut, in the meantime, the silly 

-*-*laws remain in effect?” our 
Mr. Chosky asked. 

“Not likely,” said Sideki. “A 
law is repealed thus: any citizen 
may go to Archives and remove 
any law, leaving the statement 
that he has abolished the law for 
his own reasons. He is then re- 
quired to keep the voided law in 
his own home for three days. 
Sometimes the citizen or citizens 
who first passed the law will go 
to the house of the abolitionist. 
Occasionally they will fight to 
the death with ritual swords, but 
most often they will parley. They 
may agree to have the law abol- 
ished. They may agree to restore 
the law. Or they may together 
work out a new law that takes 
into account the objections to the 
old.” 

“Then every Camiroi law is 
subject to random challenge?” 
Chosky asked. 

“Not exactly,” said Miss Dia. 
“A law which has stood unchal- 
lenged and unappealed for nine 
years becomes privileged. A citi- 
zen wishing to abolish such a law 
by removal must leave in its place 
not only his declaration of remov- 
al but also three fingers of his 
right hand as earnest of his ser- 
iousness in the matter. But a 


58 


GALAXY 


magistrate or a citizen going to 
reconstitute the law has to con- 
tribute only one of his fingers to 
the parley.” 

“This seems to me to favor the 
establishment,” I said. 

“We have none,” said Sideki. 
“I know that is hard for Earth- 
lings to understand.” 

“But is there no senate or legis- 
lative body on Camiroi, or even a 
president?” Miss Holly asked. 

“Yes, there’s a president,” said 
Miss Dia, “and he is actually a 
dictator or tyrant. He is chosen 
by lot for a term of one week. 
Any of you could be chosen for 
the term starting tomorrow, but 
the odds are against it. We do not 
have a permanent senate, but 
often there are hasty senates con- 
stituted, and they have full pow- 
ers.” 

“Such bodies having full powers 
is what we want to study,” I said. 
“When will the next one be con- 
stituted, and how will it act?” 

“So, constitute yourselves one 
now and see how you act,” said 
young Nautes. “You simply say, 
‘We constitute ourselves a Hasty 
Senate of Camiroi with full pow- 
ers.’ Register yourselves at the 
nearest symbouleutic post, and 
study your senate introspective- 
ly.” 

“Could we fire the president- 
dictator?” Miss Holly asked. 

“Certainly,” said Sideki, “but 
a new president would imme- 


diately be chosen by lot; and 
your senate would not carry over 
to the new term, nor could any of 
you three partake of a new sen- 
ate until a full presidential term 
had passed. But I wouldn’t, if I 
were you, form a senate to fire 
the present president. He is very 
good with the ritual sword.” 

“Then citizens do actually fight 
with them yet?” Mr. Chosky 
asked. 

“Yes, any private citizen may 
at any time challenge any other 
private citizen for any reason, or 
for none. Sometimes, but not of- 
ten, they fight to the death, and 
they may not be interfered with. 
We call these decisions the Court 
of Last Resort.” 

■O eason says that the legal sys- 
tem on Camiroi cannot be as 
simple as this, and yet it seems 
to be. Starting with the thesis 
that every citizen of Camiroi 
should be able to handle every 
assignment or job on Camiroi, 
these people have cut organiza- 
tion to the minimum. These things 
we consider fluid or liberal about 
the legal system of Camiroi. 
Hereafter, whenever I am tempt- 
ed to think of some law or custom 
of Earth as liberal, I will pause. 
I will hear Camiroi laughing. 

On the other hand, there are 
these things which I consider ada- 
mant or conservative about the 
laws of Camiroi: 


POLITY AND CUSTOMS OF THE CAMIROI 


59 


No assembly on Camiroi for 
purposes of entertainment may 
exceed thirty-nine persons. No 
more than this number may wit- 
ness any spectacle or drama, or 
hear a musical presentation, or 
watch a sporting event. This is 
to prevent the citizens from be- 
coming mere spectators rather 
than originators or partakers. 
Similarly, no writing — other 
than certain rare official promul- 
gations — may be issued in more 
than thirty-nine copies in one 
month. This, it seems to us, is a 
conservative ruling to prevent 
popular enthusiasms. 

A father of a family who twice 
in five years appeals to special- 
ists for such things as simple sur- 
gery for members of his house- 
hold, or legal or financial or 
medical advice, or any such things 
as he himself should be capable 
of doing, shall lose his citizen- 
ship. It seems to us that this rul- 
ing obstructs the Camiroi from 
the full fruits of progress and re- 
search. They say, however, that it 
compels every citizen to become 
an expert in everything. 

Any citizen who pleads incapa- 
city when chosen by lot to head 
a military operation or a scientific 
project or a trade combine shall 
lose his citizenship and suffer mu- 
tilation. But one who assumes 
such responsibility and then fails 
in the accomplishment of the task, 
shall suffer the loss and the muti- 


lation only for two such failures. 

Both cases seem to us to consti- 
tute cruel and unusual punish- 
ment. 

Any citizen chosen by lot to 
provide a basic invention or dis- 
play a certain ingenuity when 
there is corporate need for it, and 
who fails to provide such inven- 
tion, shall be placed in such a po- 
sition that he will lose his life 
unless he displays even greater 
ingenuity and invention than was 
originally called for. 

This seems to us to be unspeak- 
ably cruel. 

There is an absolute death pen- 
alty for impiety. But to the ques- 
tion of what constitutes impiety, 
we received a startling answer. 

“If you have to ask what it is, 
then you are guilty of it. For 
piety is comprehension of the 
basic norms. Lack of awareness of 
the special Camiroi context is the 
greatest impiety of all. Beware, 
new citizens! Should a person 
more upright and less indulgent 
than myself have heard your 
question, you might be executed 
before night-rise.” 

The Camiroi, however, are 
straight-faced kidders. We do not 
believe that we were in any dan- 
ger of execution, but we had been 
told bluntly not to ask questions 
of a certain sort. 

CONCLUSION — Inconclu- 
sive. We are not yet able to un- 


60 


GALAXY 


derstand the true legal system of 
Camiroi, but we have begun to 
acquire the viewpoint from which 
it may be studied. We recommend 
continuing study by a permanent 
resident team in this field. 

— PAUL PIGGOTT, 
Political Analyst 

F rom the journey-book of 
Charles Chosky, chief of field 
group. 

The basis of Camiroi polity and 
procedure is that any Camiroi 
citizen should foe capable of fill- 
ing any job on or pertaining to 
the planet. If it is ever the case 
that even one citizen should prove 
incapable of this, they say, then 
their system has already failed. 

“Of course, it fails many times 
every day,” one of their men ex- 
plained to me, but it does not 
fail completely. It is like a man 
in motion. He is falling off-bal- 
ance at every step, but he saves 
himself, and so he strides. Our 
polity is always in motion. Should 
it come to rest, it would die.” 
“Have the Camiroi a religion?” 
I asked citizen after citizen of 
them. 

“I think so,” one of them said 
finally. “I believe that we do 
have that, and nothing else. The 
difficulty is in the word. Your 
Earth English word may come 
from religionem or from telegion- 
em; it may mean a legality, or it 
may mean a revelation. I believe 


it is a mixture of the two con- 
cepts; with us it is. Of course we 
have a religion. What else is 
there to have?” 

“Could you draw a parallel be- 
tween Camiroi and Earth reli- 
gion?” I asked him. 

“No, I couldn’t,” he said blunt- 
ly. “I’m not being rude. I just 
don’t know how.” 

But another intelligent Camiroi 
gave me some ideas on it. 

“The closest I could come to 
explaining the difference,” he 
said, “is by a legend that is told 
(as our Camiroi phrase has it) 
with the tongue so far in the cheek 
that it comes out the vulgar body 
aperture.” 

“What is the legend?” I asked 
him. 

“The legend is that men (or 
whatever local creatures) were 
tested on all the worlds. On some 
of the worlds, men persevered in 
grace. These have become the 
transcendent worlds, asserting 
themselves as stars rather than 
planets and swallowing their own 
suns, becoming fully incandescent 
in their merged persons living in 
grace and light. The more devel- 
oped of them are those closed 
bodies which we know only by 
inference, so powerful and con- 
tained that they let no light or 
gravity or other emission escape 
them. They become of them- 
selves closed and total universes, 
of their own space and outside of 


POLITY AND CUSTOMS OF THE CAMIROI

what we call space, perfect in 
their merged mentality and spir- 
it. 

“Then there are the worlds like 
Earth where men did fall from 
Grace. On these worlds, each per- 
son contains an interior abyss 
and is capable both of great 
heights and depths. By our leg- 
end, the persons of these worlds, 
after their fall were condemned 
to live for thirty thousand gener- 
ations in the bodies of animals 
and were then permitted to begin 
their slow and frustrating ascent 
back to remembered personhood. 

“But the case of Camiroi was 
otherwise. We do not know 
whether there are further worlds 
of our like case. The primordial 
test-people of Camiroi did not 
fall. And they did not persevere. 
They hesitated. They could not 
make up their minds. They 
thought the matter over, and 
then they thought it over some 
more. Camiroi was therefore 
doomed to think matters over for- 
ever. 

“So we are the equivocal peo- 
ple, capable of curious and con- 
tinuing thought. But we have a 
hunger both for the depths and 
the heights which we have missed. 
To be sure, our Golden Medio- 
crity, our serene plateau, is higher 
than the heights of most worlds, 
higher than those of Earth, I be- 
lieve. But it has not the exhilera- 
tion of height.” 


“But you do not believe in leg- 
ends,” I said. 

“A legend is the highest scien- 
tific statement when it is the only 
statement available,” the Camiroi 
said. “We are the people who live 
according to reason. It makes a 
good life, but it lacks salt. You 
people have a literature of Uto- 
pias. You value their ideals high- 
ly, and they do have some effect 
on you. Yet you must feel that 
they all have this quality of the 
insipid. And according to Earth 
standards, we are a Utopia. We 
are a world of the third case. 

“We miss a lot. The enjoyment 
of poverty is generally denied to 
us. We have a certain hunger for 
incompetence, which is why some 
Earth things find a welcome here 
— bad Earth music, bad Earth 
painting and sculpture and dra- 
ma, for instance. The good we can 
produce ourselves. The bad we 
are incapable of, and must im- 
port. Some of us believe that we 
need it in our diet.” 

“If this is true, your position 
seems enviable to me,” I said. 

“Yours isn’t,” he said, “and yet 
you are the most complete. You 
have both halves, and you have 
your numbers. We know, of 
course, that the Giver has never 
given a life anywhere until there 
was real need for it, and that 
everything born ot created has 
its individual part to play. But 
we wish the Giver would be more 


62 


GALAXY 


generous to us in this, and it is in 
this particularly that we envy 
Earth. 

“A difficulty with us is that we 
do our great deeds at too young 
an age and on distant worlds. We 
are all of us more or less retired 
by the age of twenty-five, and we 
have all had careers such as you 
would not believe. We come home 
then to live maturely on our ma- 
ture world. It’s perfect, of course, 
but of a perfection too small. We 
have everything — except the one 
thing that matters, for which we 
cannot even find a name.” 

I talked to many of the intelli- 
gent Camiroi on our short stay 
there. It was often difficult to tell 
whether they were talking serious- 
ly or whether they were mocking 
me. We do not as yet understand 
the Camiroi at all. Further study 
is recommended.

schedonahthropologist. 

Camiroi, the word is plural in 
form, is used for the people in 
both the single and plural and for 
the planet itself. 

The civilization of Camiroi is 
more mechanical and more scien- 
tific than that of Earth, but it is 
more disguised. Their ideal ma- 
chine shall have no moving parts 
at all, shall be noiseless and shall 


not look like a machine. For this 
reason, there is something pastor- 
al about even the most thickly 
populated districts of Camiroi 
City. 

The Camiroi are fortunate in 
the natural furnishings of their 
planet. The scenery of Camiroi 
conforms to the dictate that all 
repetition is tedious, for there is 
only one of each thing on that 
world. There is one major conti- 
nent and one minor continent of 
quite different character; one fine 
cluster of islands of which the in- 
dividual isles are of very different 
style; one great continental river 
with its seven branches flowing 
out of seven sorts of land; one 
complex of volcanoes; one great 
range of mountains, one titanic 
waterfall with her three so differ- 
ent daughters nearby; one inland 
sea, one gulf, one beach which is 
a three hundred and fifty mile 
crescent passing through seven 
phases named for the colors of 
iris; one great rain forest, one 
palm grove, one leaf-fall grove, 
one of evergreens and one of eod- 
endrons; one grain bowl, one fruit 
bowl, one pampas, one parkland; 
one desert, one great oasis; and 
Camiroi City is the one great city. 
And all these places are unex- 
celled of their kind. 

There are no ordinary places on 
Camiroi! 

Travel being rapid, a compara- 
tively poor young couple may go 


POLITY AND CUSTOMS OF THE CAMIROI

from anywhere on the planet to 
Green Beach, for instance, to take 
their evening meal, in less time 
than the consumption of the meal 
will take them, and for less money 
than that reasonable meal will 
cost. This easy and frequent travel 
makes the whole world one com- 
munity. 

The Camiroi believe in the ne- 
cessity of the frontier. They con- 
trol many primitive worlds, and I 
gather hints that they are some- 
times cruel in their management. 
The tyrants and proconsuls of 
these worlds are young, usually 
still in their teens. The young 
people are to have their careers 
and make their mistakes while in 
the foreign service. When they 
return to Camiroi they are sup- 
posed to be settled and of tested 
intelligence. 

The earning scale of the Cami- 
roi is curious. A job of mechani- 
cal drudgery pays higher than one 
of intellectual interest and in- 
volvement. This often means that 
the least intelligent and least able 
of the Camiroi will have more 
wealth than those of more ability. 
“This is fair,” the Camiroi tell us. 
“Those not able to receive the 
higher recompense are certainly 
entitled to the lower.” They re- 
gard the Earth system as grossly 
inequal, that a man should have 
both a superior job and superior 
pay, and that another man should 
have the inferior of both. 


'Tphough official offices and jobs 
are usually filled by lot, yet 
persons can apply for them for 
their own reasons. In special 
conditions there might even be 
competition for an assignment, 
such as directorship of trade 
posts where persons (for private 
reasons) might wish to acquire 
great fortunes rapidly. We wit- 
nessed confrontations between 
candidates in several of these 
campaigns, and they were curi- 
ous. 

“My opponent is a three and 
seven,” said one candidate, and 
then he sat down. 

“My opponent is a five and 
nine,” said the other candidate. 
The small crowd clapped, and 
that was the confrontation or de- 
bate. 

We attended another such ral- 
ly- 

“My opponent is an eight and 
ten,” one candidate said briskly. 

“My opponent is a two and 
six,” said the other, and they 
went off together. 

We did not understand this, 
and we attended a third confron- 
tation. There seemed to be a little 
wave of excitement about to 
break here. 

“My opponent is an old num- 
ber four,” said one candidate with 
a voice charged with emotion, and 
there was a gasp from the small 
crowd. 

“I will not answer the charge,” 


64 


GALAXY 


said the other candidate shaking 
with anger. “The blow is too foul, 
and we had been friends.” 

We found the key then. The 
Camiroi are experts at defama- 
tion, but they have developed a 
shorthand system to save time. 
They have their decalog of slan- 
der, and the numbers refer to this. 
In its accepted version it runs as 
follows : 

MY OPPONENT (1) is per- 
sonally moronic. (2) is sexually 
incompetent. (3) flubs third 
points in Chuki game. (4) eats 
Mu seeds before the time of the 
summer solstice. (5) is ideologi- 
cally silly. (6) is physically pa- 
thetic. (7) is financially stupid. 
(8) is ethically weird. (9) is in- 
tellectually contemptible. (10) is 
morally dishonest. 

Try it yourself, on your friends 
or your enemies! It works won- 
derfully. We recommend the list- 
ing and use to Earth politicians, 
except for numbers three and four 
which seem to have no meaning 
in Earth context. 

r T"'he Camiroi have a corpus of 
-*• proverbs. We came on them 
in Archives, along with an at- 
tached machine with a hundred 
levers on it. We depressed the 
lever marked Earth English, and 
had a sampling of these proverbs 
put into Earth context. 

A man will not become rich by 
raising goats, the machine issued. 


Yes, that could almost pass for 
an Earth proverb. It almost 
seems to mean something. 

Even buzzards sometimes gag. 
That has an Earth sound also. 

It’s that or pluck chickens. 

“I don’t believe I understand 
that one,” I said. 

“You think it’s easy to put 
these in Earth context, you try 
it sometime,” the translation ma- 
chine issued. “The proverb ap- 
plies to distasteful but necessary 
tasks.” 

“Ah, well, let’s try some more,” • 
said Paul Piggott. “That one.” 

A bird in the hand is worth two 
in the bush, the machine issued 
abruptly. 

“But that is an Earth proverb 
word for word,” I said. 

“You wait I finish it, lady,” 
the translation machine growled. 
“To this proverb in its classical 
form is always appended a car- 
toon showing a bird fluttering 
away and a man angrily wiping 
his hand with some disposable 
material while he says “A bird 
in the hand is not worth two in 
the bush.” 

“Are we being had by a ma- 
chine?” our leader Charles Chos- 
ky asked softly. 

“Give us that proverb there,” 

I pointed one out to the machine. 

There’ll be many a dry eye here 
when you leave, the machine is- 
sued. 

We left.

64T may be in serious trouble,” 
-I- I said to a Camiroi lady of 
my acquaintance, “Well, aren’t 
you going to ask me what it is?” 
“No, I don’t particularly care,” 
she said. “But tell me if you feel 
an absolute compulsion to it.” 

“I never heard of such a thing,” 
I said. “I have been chosen by 
lot to head a military expedition 
for the relief of a trapped force 
on a world I never heard of. I 
am supposed to raise and supply 
this force (out of my private 
funds, it says here) and have it 
in flight within eight oodles. 
That’s only two hours. What will 
I do?” 

“Do it, of course, Miss Holly,” 
the lady said. “You are a citizen 
of Camiroi now, and you should 
be proud to take charge of such 
an operation.” 

“But I don’t know how! What 
will happen if I just tell them 
that 1 don’t know how?” 

“Oh, you’ll lose your citizen- 
ship and suffer mutilation. That’s 
the law, you know.” 

“How will they mutilate me?” 
“Probably cut off your nose. I 
wouldn’t worry about it. It 
doesn’t do much for you any- 
how.” 

“But we have to go back to 
Earth! We were going to go to- 
morrow, but now we want to go 
today. I do anyhow.” 

“Earth kid, if I were you, I’d 
get out to Sky-Port awful fast.” 


By a coincidence (I hope it was 
no more than that) our political 
analyst Paul Piggott had been 
chosen by lot to make a survey 
(personally, minutely and inte- 
riorly, the directive said) of the 
sewer system of Camiroi City. 
And our leader Charles Chosky 
had been selected by lot to put 
down a rebellion of Groll’s Trolls 
on one of the worlds, and to leave 
his right hand and his right eye 
as surety for the accomplishment 
of the mission. 

We were rather nervous as we 
waited for Earth Flight at Sky- 
Port, particularly so when a group 
of Camiroi acquaintances ap- 
proached us. But they did not 
stop us. They said good-by to us 
without too much enthusiasm. 

“Our visit has been all too 
short,” I said hopefully. 

“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” one 
of them rejoined. “There is a 
Camiroi proverb — ” 

“We’ve heard it,” said our lead- 
er Charles Chosky. “We also are 
dry-eyed about leaving.” 

FINAL RECOMMENDA- 
TION. That another and broader 
Field Group be sent to study the 
Camiroi in greater detail. That a 
special study might fruitfully be 
made of the humor of the Ca- 
miroi. That no members of the 
first Field Group should serve on 
the second Field Group.

The Man Who 

Loved the Faioli 

by ROGER ZELAZNY 


John Auden didn't fear the 
Faioli, deadly though they 
were ... for he was immune! 


I t is the story of John Auden 
and the Faioli, and no one 
knows it better than I. Listen — 

It happened on that evening, 
as he strolled (for there was no 
reason not to stroll) in his fa- 
vorite places in the whole world, 
that he saw the Faioli near tire 
Canyon of the Dead, seated on 
a rock, her wings of light flicker- 
ing, flickering, flickering and 
then gone, until it appeared that 
a human girl was sitting there, 
dressed all in white and weeping, 
with long black tresses coiled 
about her waist. 

He approached her through 
the terrible light from the dying, 
half-dead sun, in which human 

67 


eyes could not distinguish dis- 
tances nor grasp perspectives 
properly (though his could), and 
he lay his right hand upon her 
shoulder and spoke a word of 
greeting and of comfort. 

It was as if he did not exist, 
however. She continued to weep, 
streaking with silver her cheeks 
the color of snow or a bone. Her 
almond eyes looked forward as 
though they saw through him, 
and her long fingernails dug into 
the flesh of her palms, though no 
blood was drawn. 

Then he knew that it was true, 
the things that are said of the 
Faioli — that they see only the 
living and never the dead, and 


that they are formed into the 
loveliest women in the entire uni- 
verse. Being dead himself, John 
Auden debated the consequences 
of becoming a living man once 
again, for a time. 

The Faioli were known to 
come to a man the month before 
his death — those rare men who 
still died — and to live with 
such a man for that final month 
of his existence, rendering to him 
every pleasure that it is possible 
for a human being to know, so 
that on the day when the kiss of 
death is delivered, which sucks 
the remaining life from his body, 
that man accepts it — no, seeks 
it! — with desire and with grace. 
For such is the power of the 
Faioli among all creatures that 
there is nothing more to be de- 
sired after such knowledge. 

John Auden considered his 
life and his death, the conditions 
of the world upon which he 
stood, the nature of his steward- 
ship and his curse and the Faioli 
— who was the loveliest creature 
he had seen in all of his four 
hundred thousand days of exis- 
tence — and he touched the place 
beneath his left armpit which ac- 
tivated the necessary mechanism 
to make him live again. 

T he creature stiffened beneath 
his touch, for suddenly it 
was flesh, his touch, and flesh, 
warm and woman-filled, that he 
68 


was touching, now that the sen- 
sations of life had returned to 
him. He knew that his touch had 
become the touch of a man once 
more. 

“I said ‘hello, and don’t cry,’ ” 
he said, and her voice was like 
the breezes he had forgotten 
through all the trees that he had 
forgotten, with their moisture 
and their odors and their colors 
all brought back to him thus: 

“From where do you come, 
man? You were not here a mo- 
ment ago.” 

“From the Canyon of the 
Dead,” he said. 

“Let me touch your face.” And 
he did, and she did. 

“It is strange that I did not 
feel you approach.” 

“This is a strange world,” he 
replied. 

“That is true,” she said. “You 
are the only living thing upon 
it.” 

And he said, “What is your 
name?” 

She said, “Call me Sythia,” 
and he did. 

“My name is John,” he told 
her, “John Auden.” 

“I have come to be with you, 
to give you comfort and pleas- 
ure,” she said, and he knew that 
the ritual was beginning. 

“Why were you weeping when 
I found you?” he asked. 

“Because I thought there was 
nothing upon this world, and I 

GALAXY 


was so tired from my travels,” 
she told him. ‘‘Do you live near 
here?” 

“Not far away,” he answered. 
“Not far away at all.” 

“Will you take me there? To 
the place where you live?” 

“Yes.” 

And she rose and followed him 
into the Canyon of the Dead, 
where he made his home. 

They descended and they de- 
scended, and all about them were 
the remains of people who once 
had lived. She did not seem to 
see these things, however, but 
kept her eyes fixed upon John’s 
face and her hand upon his arm. 

“Why do you call this place 
the Canyon of the Dead?” she 
asked him. 

“Because they are all about us 
here, the dead,” he replied. 

“I feel nothing.” 

“I know.” 

nphey crossed through the Val- 
ley of the Bones, where mil- 
lions of the dead from many 
races and worlds lay stacked all 
about them, and she did not see 
these things. She had come to 
the graveyard of all the worlds, 
but she did not realize this thing. 
She had encountered its tender, 
its keeper, and she did not know 
what he was, he who staggered 
beside her like a man drunken. 

John Auden took her to his 
home — not really the place 
T HE MAN WHO LOVED THE FAIOLI 


where he lived, but it would be 
now — and there he activated 
ancient circuits within the build- 
ing within the mountain. In re- 
sponse light leaped forth from 
the walls, light he had never 
needed before, but now required. 

The door slid shut behind 
them, and the temperature built 
up to a normal warmth. Fresh 
air circulated. He took it into his 
lungs and expelled it, glorying in 
the forgotten sensation. His heart 
beat within his breast, a red warm 
thing that reminded him of the 
pain and of the pleasure. For the 
first time in ages, he prepared a 
meal and fetched a bottle of wine 
from one of the deep, sealed lock- 
ers. How many others could have 
borne what he had borne? 

None, perhaps. 

She dined with him. toying 
with the food, sampling a bit of 
everything, eating very little. He, 
on the other hand, glutted him- 
self fantastically, and they drank 
of the wine and were happy. 

“This place is so strange,” she 
said. “Where do you sleep?” 

“I used to sleep in there,” he 
told her, indicating a room he 
had almost forgotten; and they 
entered and he showed it to her, 
and she beckoned him toward the , 
bed and the pleasures of her 
body. 

That night he loved her, many 
times, with a desperation that 
burnt away the alcohol and push- 

69 


ed all of his life forward with 
something like a hunger, but 
more. 

The following day, when the 
dying sun had splashed the Val- 
ley of the Bones with its pale, 
moonlike light, he awakened and 
she drew his head to her breast, 
not having slept herself, and she 
asked him, “What is the thing 
that moves you, John Auden? 
You are not like one of the men 
who live and who die, but you 
take life almost like one of the 
Faioli, squeezing from it every- 
thing that you can and pacing 
it at a tempo that bespeaks a 
sense of time no man should 
know. What are you?” 

“I am one who knows,” he 
said. “I am one who knows that 
the days of a man are numbered 
and one who covets their disposi- 
tions as he feels them draw to a 
close.” 

“You are strange,” said Sythia. 
“Have I pleased you?” 

“More than anything else I 
have ever known,” he said. 

And she sighed, and he found 
her lips once again. 

A I 'hey breakfasted, and that day 
they walked in the Valley 
of the Bones. He could not dis- 
tinguish distances nor grasp per- 
spectives properly, and she could 
not see anything that had been 
living and now was dead. So, of 
course, as they sat there on a 
70 


shelf of stone, his arm about her 
shoulders, he pointed out to her 
the rocket which had just come 
down from out of the sky, and 
she squinted after his gesture. 
He indicated the robots, which 
had begun unloading the remains 
of the dead of many worlds from 
the hold of the ship, and she 
cocked her head to one side and 
stared ahead, but she did not 
really see what he was talking 
about. 

Even when one of the robots 
lumbered up to him and held out 
the board containing the receipts 
and the stylus, and as he signed 
the receipt for the bodies re- 
ceived, she did not see or under- 
stand what it was that was oc- 
curring. 

In the days that followed, his 
life took upon it a dreamlike 
quality, filled with the pleasure 
of Sythia and shot through with 
certain inevitable streaks of 
pain. Often, she saw him wince, 
and she asked him concerning his 
expressions. 

And always he would laugh 
and say, “Pleasure and pain are 
near to one another,” or some 
thing such as that. 

And as the days wore on, she 
came to prepare the meals and 
to rub his shoulders and mix his 
drinks and to recite to him cer- 
tain pieces of poetry he had 
somehow once come to love. 

A month. A month, he knew, 
GALAXY 


and it would come to an end. 
The Faioli, whatever they were, 
paid for the life that they took 
with the pleasures of the flesh. 
They always knew when a man’s 
death was near at hand. And in 
this sense, they always gave more 
than they received. The life was 
fleeing anyway, and they en- 
hanced it before they took it, 
away with them, to nourish 
themselves most likely, price of 
the things that they’d given. 

John Auden knew that no 
Faioli in the entire universe had 
ever met a man such as himself. 

Sythia was mother-of-pearl, 
and her body was alternately 
cold and warm to his caresses, 
and her mouth was a tiny flame, 
igniting wherever it touched, with 
its teeth like needles and its 
tongue like the heart of a flower. 
And so he , came to know the 
thing called love for the Faioli 
called Sythia. 

1VT othing must really happen 

^ beyond the loving. He knew 
that she wanted him, to use him 
ultimately, and he was perhaps 
the only man in the universe able 
to gull one of her kind. His was 
the perfect defense against life 
and against death. Now that he 
was human and alive, he often 
wept when he considered it. 

He had more than a month to 
live. 

He had maybe three or four. 
THE MAN WHO LOVED THE FAIOLI 


This month, therefore, was a 
price he’d willingly pay for what 
it was that the Faioli offered. 

Sythia racked his body and 
drained from it every drop of 
pleasure contained within his 
tired nerve cells. She turned him 
into a flame, an iceberg, a little 
boy, an old man. When they 
were together, his feelings were 
such that he considered the con- 
s ol amentum as a thing he might 
really accept at the end of the 
month, which was drawing near. 
Why not? He knew she had filled 
his mind with her presence, on 
purpose. But what more did exis- 
tence hold for him? This creature 
from beyond the stars had 
brought him every single thing a 
man could desire. She had bap- 
tized him with passion and con- 
firmed him with the quietude 
which follows after. Perhaps the 
final oblivion of her final kiss 
was best after all. 

He seized her and drew her to 
him. She did not understand him, 
but she responded. 

He loved her for it, and this 
was almost his end. 

There is a thing called disease 
that battens upon all living 
things, and he had known it be- 
yond the scope of all living 
men. She could not understand, 
woman-thing who had known 
only life. 

So he never tried to tell her, 
though with each day the taste 

71 


of her kisses grew stronger and 
saltier, and each seemed to him a 
strengthening shadow, darker and 
darker, stranger and heavier, of 
that one thing which he now 
knew he desired most. 

And the day would come. And 
come it did. 

TTe held her and caressed her, 

-*■ and the calendars of all his 
days fell about them. 

He knew, as he abandoned 
himself to her ploys and the 
glories of her mouth, her breasts, 
that he had been ensnared, as 
had all men who had known 
them, by the power of the Faioli. 
Their strength was their weak- 
ness. They were the ultimate in 
Woman. By their frailty they be- 
gat the desire to please. He want- 
ed to merge himself with the 
pale landscape of her body, to 
pass within the circles of her 
eyes and never depart. 

He had lost, he knew. For as 
the days had vanished about him, 
he had weakened. He was barely 
able to scrawl his name upon the 
receipts proffered him by the 
robot who had lumbered toward 
him, crushing ribcages and crack- 
ing skulls with each terrific step. 
Briefly, he envied the thing. Sex- 
less, passionless, totally devoted 
to duty. Before he dismissed it, 
he asked it, “What would you 
do if you had desire and you met 
with a thing that gave you all 
72 


the things you wished for in the 
world?” 

“I would — try to — keep it,” 
it said, red lights blinking about 
its dome, before it turned and 
lumbered off, across the Great 
Graveyard. 

“Yes,” said John Auden aloud, 
“but this thing cannot be done.” 

Sythia did not understand him, 
and on that thirty-first day they 
returned to that place where he 
had lived for a month, and he 
felt the fear of death, strong, so 
strong, come upon him. 

She was more exquisite than 
ever before, but he feared this 
final encounter. 

“I love you,” he said finally, 
for it was a thing he had never 
said before, and she kissed him. 

“I know,” she told him, “and 
your time is almost at hand, to 
love me completely. Before the 
final act of love, my John Auden, 
tell me a thing: What is it that 
sets you apart? Why is it 
that you know so much more 
of things-that-are-not-life than 
mortal man should know? How 
was it that you approached me 
on that first night without my 
knowing it?” 

“It is because I am already 
dead,” he told her. “Can’t you 
see it when you look into my 
eyes?” 

“I do not understand,” she said. 

“Kiss me and forget it,” he told 
her. “It is better this way. 

GALAXY 


But she was curious and asked 
him (using the familiar for the 
first time), “How then dost thou 
achieve this balance between life 
and that-which-is-not-life, this 
thing which keeps thee conscious 
yet unliving?” 

“There are controls set within 
this body I happen, unfortunate- 
ly, to occupy. To touch this place 
beneath my left armpit will cause 
my lungs to cease their breathing 
and my heart to stop its beating. 
It will set into effect an installed 
electro-chemical system, like 
those my robots (invisible to 
you, I know) possess. This is my 
life within death. I asked for it 
because I feared oblivion. I 
volunteered to be gravekeeper to 
the universe, because in this place 
there are none to look upon me 
and be repelled by my death- 
like appearance. This is why I 
am what I am. Kiss me and end 
it.” 

But having taken the form of 
woman, or perhaps being woman 
all along, the Faioli who was 
called Sythia was curious, and 
she said, “This place?” and she 
touched the spot beneath his left 
armpit. 

’\X7’ith this he vanished from 

’ ’ her sight, and with this also, 
he knew once again the icy logic 
that stood apart from emotion. 
Because of this, he did not touch 
upon the critical spot once again. 
TH C MAN WHO LOVED THE FAIOLI 


Instead, he watched her as she 
sought for him about the place 
where he once had lived. 

She checked into every closet 
and adytum, and when she could 
not discover a living man, she 
sobbed once, horribly, as she had 
on that night when first he had 
seen her. Then the wings flicker- 
ed, flickered, weakly flickered, 
back into existence upon her back, 
and her face dissolved and her 
body slowly melted. The tower 
of sparks that stood before him 
then vanished, and later on that 
crazy night during which he 
could distinguish distances and 
grasp perspectives once again he 
began looking for her. 

And that is the story of John 
Auden, the only man who ever 
loved a Faioli and lived (if you 
could call it that) to tell of it. 
No one knows it better than I. 

No cure has ever been found. 
And I know that he walks the 
Canyon of the Dead and con- 
siders the bones, sometimes stops 
by the rock where he met her, 
blinks after the moist things that 
are not there, wonders at the 
judgment that he gave. 

It is that way, and the moral 
may be that life (and perhaps 
love also) is stronger than that 
which it contains, but never that 
which contains it. But only a 
Faioli could tell you for sure, and 
they never come here any more.

BY WILLY LEY 


ANOTHER LOOK 
AT ATLANTIS 

r T"'his is a story I was told some 
-®- thirty-five years ago by a 
novelist who swore that it actual- 
ly happened. It concerned an- 
other writer whom both of us 
knew and who wrote a great deal 
for a weekly family magazine. 
One day the editor of that mag- 
azine, after an evening of spirited 
discussion with his wife and her 


74 



two sisters, asked him to write 
a definitive article on Atlantis. 
If necessary, it could be a series 
of articles, but they should be 
definitive, clearing up the whole 
problem once and for all time! 

The writer, whose knowledge 
of Atlantis was about equal to 
that of any other educated man 
who has not made a special 
study of the subject, phoned a 
librarian he knew and told him 
(this was in Europe, where li- 
brarians are usually male) that 
he had to read up on Atlantis and 
would be over the following 
morning. Would the librarian be 
so good and assemble the most 
important books for him? 

When he arrived at the library 
there was a desk reserved for 
him, and it was piled high with 
books. The librarian explained 
that these were the most recent 
works and a few important older 
ones. And there was a paper- 
bound sheaf of mimeographed 
pages. This was what the librar- 
ian called “a reasonably com- 
plete bibliography” — of about 
1700 titles. After his friend had 
finished with the books he had 
pulled out, he might wish to 
check through the bibliography 
and mark what else he wanted 
to read. The library would not 
have all of these titles, of course, 
but a few score of them probably 
could be turned up. 

I don’t know what happened 


to that ‘‘definitive” article — 
chances are it was never written. 

However, other people who did 
not feel beaten down by the vol- 
ume of earlier literature kept 
writing books on Atlantis. As 
has been the case in the past, 
they ranged over the whole spec- 
trum from “inner visions” to so- 
mber attempts to find an inter- 
pretation that satisfied both his- 
torical tradition and recognized 
facts. My reason for bringing up 
the nearly-talked-to-death Atlan- 
tis theme once more is that some- 
thing very unusual has taken 
place in recent years: there are 
a few new facts! 

No, it is not yet the “defini- 
tive” story that magazine editor 
wanted so desperately. For the 
core of the Atlantis problem is 
that the “definitive” solution in- 
volves an impossibility — name- 
ly that of reading the mind of 
a man who died over 2300 years 
ago. 

I mean, of course, Plato, who 
lived from about 427 B.C. to 
347 B.C. 

Atlantis is mentioned in two 
of his works, the two “dialogues” 
(“discussions” would be a better 
label) Timaios and Kritias. They 
are the only, repeat, only sources. 
Every other mention of Atlantis 
is based on these writings of 
Plato. There are no independent 
sources. 


FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


75 


Nor did Plato claim to have 
any direct and personal knowl- 
edge. He had one of his charac- 
ters quote Solon, a historiacl fig- 
ure (ca. 638 B.C. to 559 B.C.), 
who was Archon of Athens (be- 
ginning in 594 B.C.) and who is 
known to have travelled exten- 
sively. So the true and again 
only source of the Atlantis story, 
if we accept Plato’s word, is So- 
lon. Please note that Solon was 
dead for 150 years when Plato 
was a young man; it is precisely 
as if a young man of our time 
told of something that, through 
family tradition, goes back to 
George Washington. 

I just said that the original 
source was Solon if we accept 
Plato’s statements. As for that 
there can be only two opinions: 
we can either believe that Plato 
wrote down what Solon original- 
ly said (admitting that Plato’s 
version might not be an absolute- 
ly accurate rendering) or else 
we can believe that it was a fable 
invented for the purpose of pro- 
viding a setting for Plato’s “ideal 
state.” 

Aristotle, Plato’s pupil, was 
convinced that Atlantis had been 
invented for philosophizing pur- 
poses. The Roman Pliny the 
Elder, four centuries later, just 
burdened Plato with the respon- 
sibility, sounding somewhat pet- 
ulant, possibly because in all his 
omnivorous reading he had never 


found another source. The pic- 
ture is the same with all the 
authors of the classical period: 
they either took Atlantis to be 
a “philosophical parable” or else 
just wrote “according to Plato.” 
Nobody got excited one way or 
the other. 

After the interval of one and 
a half millenia, when nobody 
had the time or inclination to 
think about such problems, a 
surprising number of learned 
men decided that Atlantis must 
have been based on a dim knowl- 
edge of the existence of a con- 
tinent on the other side of the 
ocean. The Spanish historian 
Fracisco Lopez de Gomara 
(1510-1560) was the first to say 
that America must have been 
meant. Sir Francis Bacon (1561- 
1626) said the same, and the 
German educator Janus Joannes 
Bircherod even coined the sen- 
tence orbe novo non novo “the 
New' World is not new”) in 1663. 
These thoughts were still echoed 
two centuries later by the great 
Alexander von Humboldt. 

The first man to have accepted 
the story as literally true seems 
to have been the learned and 
versatile Jesuit Father Athana- 
sius Kircher (1601-1680), who 
invented the magic lantern and 
thought that he had deciphered 
hieroglyphic writing. He pictured 
Atlantis as a small continent in 
the Atlantic Ocean. (Fig. 1.).

GALAXY 



Fig. 1. Atlantis according to Kircher. 

from his book Mondus subterraneus 
(1644). This tracing has been in- 
verted, in the original north is at 
the bottom. 

Though he said in his book that 
the island is pictured in precise 
agreement with Plato’s descrip- 
tion this is not really so, as we’ll 
see. All that can be said in favor 
of it is that the small continent 
is about the size stated by Plato, 
that it has a mountain and sev- 
eral large rivers. 

T)ut before we go on it seems 
to be practical to see what 
Plato actually said. The informa- 
tion provided in the Timaios, the 
earlier of the two dialogues, is 
relatively meager. The man who 
tells about Atlantis in both dia- 
logues is one Kritias, grandson 
of a man by the same name, who 
was a son of Dropides, who was 
a personal friend of Solon. Solon, 
Kritias the Younger, reports, 
travelled to Egypt; the actual 
and historical date for that trip 
is somewhere between 590 B.C. 
and 580 B.C. He went to the city 


of Sais and had long conversa- 
tions with the priests there, who 
told him that their goddess 
Neith, whom the Greeks call 
Athena, had founded both cities, 
Sais 8000 years ago and Athens 
9000 years ago. At that time 
there existed an island beyond 
the pillars of Hercules: “it was 
larger than Lybia and Asia put 
together.” 

This last sentence needs two 
emendations. One is that “Asia” 
means what we call Asia minor, 
and the other is that the original 
Greek sentence contains a word 
that cannot be translated by just 
one other word. That word is 
meizon. The customary transla- 
tion is “larger” in the meaning 
of “greater in extent.” But the 
word can also mean “more pow- 
erful,” and since the story then 
goes on to talk about an invasion 
from Atlantis this translation 
sounds more likely. The priests 
said that this invasion had the 
purpose of subjugating the east- 
ern portion of the Mediterran- 
ean and that they almost suc- 
ceeded but were finally beaten 
by the Athenians. “Afterwards 
there occurred violent earth- 
quakes and floods and in a single 
'day and night of rain your war- 
like men in a body sank into the 
earth, and the island of Atlantis 
in a like manner disappeared and 
was sunk beneath the sea.” 

There is no more about Atlan- 

77 


FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


tis in the Timaios, and if the 
other dialogue which is named 
after Kritias did not exist, no- 
body would have paid much at- 
tention to the ancient invasion 
and ancient catastrophe. Every- 
body would have accepted Aris- 
totle’s commentary: ”He who in- 
vented it [namely Atlantis] also 
destroyed it.” 

But it was the Kritias that ex- 
cited everybody, because here 
the narrator went into detail. On 
the island in question there 
dwelled people, and Poseidon 
fell in love with one of the girls. 
He lived with her on a small 
mountain and begat five pairs of 
twins, all male and all future 
kings. He surrounded the moun- 
tain with several circular courses 
of water “so that no man could 
get to the island for ships and 
voyages were not yet heard of.” 
That these concentric courses of 
water were made by a god must 
be taken to mean that this was 
a natural formation. But the 
later kings, after the population 
had become numerous, embel- 
lished on this formation with 
walls and canals through the cir- 
cular courses of land, so that 
ships could pass from one into 


* A stadion was divided into 600 feet, 
Greek. Its length is now taken to have 
been 185 meters, or 607 feet, U. S. 
measure. The secondary meaning — of 
“race course” — of this word is derived 
from the fact that the race course at 
Olympia was one stadion in length. 


the other. The water courses 
were spanned by a bridge which, 
of course, had to have three sec- 
tions. (This explains why the 
word “bridge” is used in the sin- 
gular, though three bridges are 
involved.) 

nphe plan of the finished city is 
shown in Fig. 2. The central 
island, with the stele inscribed 
with the laws, a temple of Posei- 
don and the king’s palace, had 
a diameter of 5 stadia*. The in- 
nermost circular water course 
was one stadion in width, and the 
land circle around it had a width 
of two stadia. Then followed a 
water circle with a width of two 
stadia, also called the Inner Har- 
bor: a circle of land, holding a

ter section of the city, as described 
by Plato. The broken circle indi-

“hippodrome” or circle course 
for race horses with a width of 
three stadia came next, sur- 
rounded by a water course, the 
Outer Harbor, of a width of three 
stadia. 

A straight canal, half a stadion 
in width and one and a half sta- 
dia in depth, stretched from the 
Outer Harbor to the ocean. It 
was fifty stadia long, so that the 
distance from the center of the 
island to the shore was 63J4 sta- 
dia. At that distance a high cir- 
cular wall was built that went 


all around the city; on the side 
away from the ocean it touched 
the Grand Canal. The Grand 
Canal was 10,000 stadia in length, 
forming a rectangle of 2000 by 
3000 stadia. The area was di- 
vided into 600 squares by irriga- 
tion ditches, each 100 feet in 
width. (Fig. 3.) 

The overall idea seems to have 
been that several rivers emptying 
into the Grand Canal would keep 
it full of water and fill the irri- 
gation ditches, with the overflow 
going into the circular Outer

Harbor and, finally, through the 
fifty-stadia canal into the ocean. 
A modern hydraulics engineer 
would be quite unhappy with 
such an open system lacking all 
locks. Two years of drought in 
the interior, and ocean water 
would storm in, going the other 
way and ruining all crops. But 
let’s not quibble here but go on. 
The total area — the irrigated 
plain, the city itself and the 
space between the irrigated plain 
and the seashore — would meas- 
ure 3000 by 2127 stadia, or close 
to 6.4 million square stadia, ap- 
proximately 77,600 square miles. 
Since there were ten kingdoms 
on the island — assuming that 
they were all the same size, 
which is not stated anywhere ex- 
plicitly — the total area of the 
island should have been about 
800,000 square miles, roughly 
three times the size of Texas. 

Even this condensed retelling 
shows that there is an enormous 
difference between the two At- 
lantis narratives in Plato’s work. 
The Timaios, with its recital 
about an invasion and military 
engagements terminated by a na- 
tural catastrophe, does convey 
the impression that an older tale 
is here merely retold. But the 
Kritias, with its enormous el- 
aboration of arrangements and 
dimensions, plus such detail as 
the color of the stones in the 
various walls and the kinds of 


metal used for ornamentation 
and reinforcement, is obviously 
the result of much pondering 
about what an outstanding city, 
originally conceived by a god 
and embellished by godlike kings 
should be like. 

The “searchers for Atlantis,” 
who accepted the story word for 
word, wall for wall and water 
course for water course, faced 
one major handicap, namely the 
great size. It prompted those who 
did not dare to doubt to look 
in all kinds of unlikely places. 
In sequence, southern Sweden, 
the Caucasus mountains, South 
America, Ceylon, Algiers and the 
western bulge of Africa were ac- 
claimed as the place were Atlan- 
tis must have been — not with- 
standing the minor fact that all of 
them are still in existence well 
above sea level. And, of course, 
there was no trace of anything 
that could possibly date back to 
9600 B.C. 

Could something be wrong 
with the figures themselves? 

jl fore than one scholar has 

* A guessed at a confusion be- 
tween solar years and periods of 
the moon. If the Egyptians spoke 
in terms of “moons” ( of 30 
days each) then 9000 “years” 
would shrink to 742 actual years. 
Since Solon heard the tale in 
about 590 B.C., the date would 
become 1332 B.C., a far more 


80 


GALAXY 


believable figure. But there is 
another possibility for a mistake. 
It is said in so many words in 
the Kritias that the Egyptian 
records had been translated into 
Egyptian from another language 
— it is not stated which one. 
Solon then translated them into 
Greek, and he may have taken 
the Egyptian written symbol for 
“100” to mean “1000.” In that 
case the invasion would date 900 
years before Solon’s visit or 
about 1500 B.C., while the rec- 
tangular plain enclosed by the 
Grand Canal would measure 200 
by 300 stadia or 23 by 34*/j miles. 
The city itself would remain the 
same size, because all the figures 
involved are smaller than “100.”* 

The suggestion that the prob- 
lem had been made intractable 
by such a simple mistake in 
translation was made by the 
seismologist Professor Anghelos 
Galanapoulos. Since Prof. Galan- 
apoulos is Greek, he is throughly 
acquainted with all the Greek 
legends and with everything by 
and about Plato. And Prof. 
Galanapoulos has been thinking 
about Atlantis for a long time. 

Under Sfi'/j ° northern latitude 
and 25'/2° eastern longitude in 
the blue Aegaean Sea there lies 


* This assumes, of course, that the plan of 
the city was a part of Solon’s tale; most 
modem commentators have strong doubts 
about that.

Aegaean Sea. 


a small group of islands, collec- 
tively known as the Santorini 
group. It consists of two large 
islands, Thera and Therasia, and 
a few small ones, namely As- 
pronisi (“white island”) and 
three with names that have the 
word lcameni (“burning”) in 
common. They are Palaia Kame- 
ni, Nea Kameni and Mikra 
Kameni, the “old burning island,” 
the new one and the tiny one. 
They are all volcanic. In 1866 
there was a long-lasting eruption 
that was carefully investigated by 
a French scientist named Fouque. 
With the aid of data furnished 
by Fouque, Professor Melchior 
Neumayr of the University of 
Vienna drew up a table of known 
eruptions. 

There had been one in 198 
B.C., during which the island of 


FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


81 


Palaia Kameni came into exis- 
tence. Another eruption in 726 
A.D. enlarged this island. In 
1573 Mikra Kameni was formed. 
In 1650 there was another erup- 
tion that produced only minor 
changes, but in 1707 there began 
one that lasted five years, with 
Nea Kameni as the result. And 
the one in 1866 formed an island 
that was named Georgios Island 
but soon combined with Nea 
Kameni. 

In, say, 250 B.C. the Santorini 
group consisted of Thera and 
Therasia only; in 1890 it looked 
as shown in Fig. 4. 

T o the geologists of the latter 
part of the nineteenth cen- 
tury the shapes of Thera and 
Therasia suggested that they 
were remaining pieces of a form- 
er volcano that had covered 
the whole area of the Santorini 
group and that had blown up at 
some time in the past. Since the 
eastern Mediterranean is an area 
of early literacy, but since no 
classical record made any men- 
tion of such a catastrophe, the 
great eruption must have taken 
place before writing, say before 
1000 B.C. The explosion of 
Krakatoa in the Sunda Sea, that 
took place in late August of 1883 
and threw a cubic mile of pumice 
and other volcanic ejecta into 
the atmosphere, came just in 
time to demonstrate what a vol- 


cano could do. The catastrophe 
that left Thera and Therasia 
must have been of the type of 
the Krakatoa explosion, and 
probably even bigger and more 
violent. 

Of course, Thera and Therasia 
are covered with thick layers of 
pumice and volcanic ashes. It 
probably would never have oc- 
curred to anybody to start ex- 
cavations to see whether anything 
could be found underneath these 
layers. If the thought had oc- 
curred to anybody, it is doubtful 
whether money for such a project 
could have been found. But sci- 
ence was aided by a commercial 
venture at this point. 

Greek business men “mined” 
the pumice for making cement 
that was needed on the mainland 
for construction purposes. And 
under the pumice and ashes re- 
mains of old buildings were 
found! Household utensils of 
shaped clay were recovered. No 
trace of inscriptions was found 
and virtually no metallic objects. 
But Fouque described two gold- 
en rings, implying trade since 
there is no gold locally. Too bad 
that one could only guess at 
the date of this early inhabita- 
tion. 

I have to admit that I do not 
know who was the first to con- 
nect the ancient eruption of San- 
torini with the end of the Minoan 
culture on Crete. Early Crete had 


32 


GALAXY 


an astonishing culture, with large 
cities and enormous temples, and 
it was a maritime power. As 
knowledge about ancient Crete 
grew, its role as the dominant 
sea power in the eastern Mediter- 
ranean became so clear that some 
scholars began to wonder wheth- 
er the early Cretans were not the 
model for the sea-going Phaia- 
kians of Homer’s Odyssey. 

And since there are many re- 
semblances between the sailors 
from Homer’s Scheria and Plato’s 
Atlanteans, and since both re- 
semble the ancient Cretans, it has 
been suggested at least twice — 
by the American E. S. Balch in 
1921 and the German W. Bran- 
denstein in 1952 — that Plato’s 
Atlantis was mainly a poetic 
memory of the Cretans. 

Legends, poetry, speculation 
and philosophy aside, there was 



Fig. 5. The area covered by volcanic ash 
from the eruption of 1500 B.C. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


a very real mystery about the 
end of the Minoan culture on 
Crete. Before about 1400 B. C. 
there were large cities, but some 
time after that date there were 
only small rural settlements. And 
most of the archeologists who 
tried to reconstruct life during 
the Minoan culture slowly be- 
came convinced that there was a 
sudden “event” that marked the 
beginning of the change. In 
places it looked as if artisans had 
dropped their tools in the middle 
of their normal activities and run 
away. The most obvious explana- 
tion was that there had been a 
sudden call to arms to ward off 
an invasion. It sounded simple 
and also sounded logical, but 
there were difficulties. A would- 
be invader would first have been 
engaged by the large Cretan 
fleet, so that a sudden call to 
arms was not too likely. Besides, 
who could have invaded Crete? 

I t was an event, all right. But 
the event was the eruption of 
Santorini — which is now esti- 
mated to have thrown about four 
times the volume of pumice and 
cinders into the atmosphere as 
Krakatoa did in 1883. While the 
sudden appearance of enormous 
black clouds must have been 
frightening, the fall of cinders and 
ashes at such a distance could 
not have been too serious. But 
such an eruption of an island 


83 


volcano produces an enormous 
tidal wave, the one caused by 
the Krakatoa explosion drowned 
over 36,000 people on the neigh- 
boring islands. The wave from 
the Santorini explosion must 
have smashed the whole Cretan 
fleet, probably assembled along 
the north shore of the island. It 
killed an unknown number of 
Cretans, and it caused the end 
of the Minoan culture, eliminat- 
ing it much faster and more 
thoroughly than any invasion by 
human enemies would have done. 

The effects of the distant vol- 
canic eruption were felt as far 
away as Egypt, though in Egypt 
the effects were psychological — 
darkness for a period of time — 
rather than physical. 

So here we have, in the right 
area and fairly closely at the 
right time, the great natural 
catastrophe of which Solon spoke. 
And it fits the general picture: 
the Greeks would have learned 
about it from the Egyptians. The 
Egyptians could also have told 
Solon about invasions from the 
West. We know that there were 
such invasions by what the 
Egyptians call the “sea people.” 
Actually these invasions took 
place about 250 years after the 
Santorini catastrophe; but, since 
all this was told to Solon another 
600 years later, the Egyptians 
may have confused the sequence 
of events. Or else Solon did not 


understand too well what they 
said. Or else Plato thought that 
it would make a better story if a 
human invasion was terminated 
by a natural catastrophe. 

The new knowledge about the 
approximate date of the Santori- 
ni catastrophe as the reason for 
the end of the Minoan culture on 
Crete has certainly shed new 
light on the “sources” of the At- 
lantis story. It does seem more 
likely now that Solon actually 
brought the tale from Egypt and 
the manuscript of the older Kri- 
tias — believed by most scholars 
to have been Plato’s literary in- 
vention — might have existed. 

But Professor Galanopculos 
went one step farther. Knowing, 
from personal observation, that 
Santorini was inhabited before 
the catastrophe, he has superim- 
posed the scale map of Plato’s 
city on the map of the Santorini 
group. He found that the whole 
group would fit inside the Outer 
Wall of Plato’s city and that the 
city itself would fit into the space 
between Thera and Therasia. As 
any one of my readers can try 
for himself, there is such a fit, 
though a rather poor one. 

Personally I consider the sim- 
ilarity in size just a coincidence. 
I don’t think that Santorini was 
Atlantis . though there can 
hardly be any doubt that San- 
torini was the main cause of the 
Atlantis story. WILLY LEY

I 

I nspector Judson Kruger was a 
tanned, thickset man with 
stiff black hair, heavy eyebrows, 
and jowls to make a razor 
cringe. Just now, though his 
wide mouth was a taut line, his 
face was carefully immobile. So 
was the rest of him. He stood 
in a shallow wooden tray with 
sled-runners under it, just out- 


side a gate in a high, wire-mesh 
fence. He wore a green suit and 
green shirt, the greenest he’d 
been able to find. He was hat- 
less; also shoeless and sockless. 
His large feet were planted up 
to the ankles in soft moist loam. 

The sign on the gate was re- 
peated in several languages. The 
English version read, “KEEP 
OUT. PLANT REFUGE. OFF- 
LIMITS TO ALL ANIMALS 


85 


MASSING OVER SEVEN- 
TEEN (17.0) GRAMS.” 

A peculiar large machine was 
clattering along the roadway just 
inside the fence. It was long, 
low and flexibly jointed on 
eight pairs of small wheels. Ele- 
vated turrets, fore and aft, ro- 
tated, aiming batteries of eyes 
resembling the bottoms of beer 
bottles. A long proboscis swept 
back and forth ahead, sniffing 
at flowers and weeds beside the 
road. Other attachments hinted 
at other senses. Now and then 
a short hose would rear itself 
and squirt a stream of something 
— nutrient, Kruger guessed — 
at some shrub. Once a small cage 
elevated itself to release a swarm 
of insects. 

On a grimmer note, folded atop 
the machine were various grap- 
ples. Some of them looked cap- 
able of seizing a man and throw- 
ing him over the fence. 

The machine rattled out of 
sight. Kruger listened for a mo- 
ment, glanced around quickly, 
and stepped from the tray, shak- 
ing loam from his feet. Seizing 
a short length of rope, he dragged 
the tray-sled toward the gate. He 
opened that, got the sled through 
and closed the gate. Hastily, he 
dragged the sled across the road 
and into the thicket beyond, then 
returned to obliterate the drag- 
marks on the road as well as he 
could. 


T J e had pinpointed his ob- 
-*■ jective from one of the sight- 
seeing airbusses allowed to fly 
over this refuge. It was perhaps 
a mile from the fence, in an area 
that served as a stop-over for 
non-resident plants. He struggled 
through the brush, which was 
local flora aqd not closely tend- 
ed, muttering various words and 
phrases when he encountered 
thorns or when the sled got 
snagged. Once a flitbot drifted 
over, and he had to hop hastily 
into the tray and stand still. If 
it saw him, it probably assumed 
he was some exotic plant sprout- 
ed from a stray seed. He went 
on. 

In half an hour he reached the 
inner edge of the thicket and 
looked out over grassland, con- 
toured in gentle slopes with ir- 
rigation pipes laid along the 
ridges, jetting little fountains of 
water. The grass was unmowed 
and unkempt. Spotted about the 
slopes were shrubs of various 
kinds, each with its small circle 
of cleared soil. Farther on were 
trees, their bases hidden from 
Kruger by intervening ridges. 
Among those trees was the one 
he sought. 

A sound like several angry 
judges clearing their throats drew 
his attention to his left. 

Hastily he stepped into his 
tray. A flitbot was moving his 
way, most of its eye-tentacles 


86 


GALAXY 


extended ahead of it. He saw 
that it was following some insect 
that buzzed low over the grass. 
On it came, rumbling ominously. 

Not far from Kruger the in- 
sect lit, and the machine pounced. 
A vacuum-cleaner extension shot 
out. But the prey — a medium- 
sized beetle — was quicker. It 
zoomed upward, buzzing fran- 
tically, dodged the questing ten- 
tacle, flashed in an arc and head- 
ed for the thicket where Kruger 
stood. 

The flitbot jerked into pur- 
suit. 

I t took all Kruger’s willpower 
to stand still. Like a homing 
missile, the insect shot toward 
him, did a loop before his hor- 
rified eyes and lit on his left 
cheek. Instantly, the pursuing 
tentacle snaked out, hit Kruger’s 
cheek ringingly and devoured the 
insect with a vengeful sucking 
sound. Kruger heard chitin 
crunch somewhere in the ma- 
chine’s interior. He also heard his 
own involuntary yell, “Ouch! 
Damn it, you don’t have to take 
my ear too!” 

The machine turned abruptly 
to hover before him. “Did you 
say something?” 

Kruger’s mind wasn’t working 
well — it was too busy restrain- 
ing his legs. He stammered, “Uh, 
no. It was just the wind in my 
hai — my tassels.” 


The flitbot glared suspicious- 
ly. “Vegetable, animal, mineral 
or ’bot?” 

“V-vegetable.” 

The machine relaxed. “Don’t 
be shy. I can see you’re new 
here. Lots of plants talk, you 
know, in one way or another. 
You’re the first I’ve heard speak 
English, though. Why did they 
plant you here at the edge of 
the thicket?” 

“I — I like it here. I get just 
enough sun, and I can look out 
over the grass. Wha-what did that 
beetle do?” 

The machine said grimly, “It 
was getting ready to nibble on 
a young, healthy grass blade. 
That kind always does, sooner or 
later. They never learn.” The 
machine chuckled. “Well, it’s 
fertilizer now, so we won’t com- 
plain, eh?” It suddenly clucked 
and sent tentacles downward. 
“Why, look at your poor roots! 
They’re half uncovered!” Croon- 
ing, it patted his feet gently, then 
pushed loam over them. “Are you 
sure you’re all right- Do you 
want a squirt of Nitro-Vite or 
anything?” 

“Un . not right now, thanks. 
I’ll just soak up a little sun.” 

He waited a while, shaking, 
after the machine left. Then, 
with a thorough look around, he 
stepped out of the sled, lifted it 
and carried it ahead of him. It 
was an awkward burden, but he 


SPARE THAT TREE 


87 


wasn’t going to drag it through 
the grass. His own tracks were 
risk enough. 

He got soaked crossing irriga- 
tion pipes, and kept imagining he 
heard machines coming, but fi- 
nally he reached the trees, put the 
sled down, caught his breath and 
began dragging the sled. Within 
fifteen minutes he reached the 
small clearing he sought. He 
found cover beneath hanging 
branches, wiggled his toes into the 
now-muddy loam, and stared at 
the lone tree in the clearing. 

II 

I t was a lovely tree. There was 
no denying that. It stood per- 
haps twenty feet tall, symmetri- 
cal and slim, with a graceful 
taper. The limbs were tastefully 
placed around the trunk, growing 
out almost horizontally with a 
slight up-turn at the ends. The 
bark was smooth and neat, a 
pleasing cinnamon brown. The 
needles, a light and warm shade 
of green, were like long pine 
needles but less stiff so that they 
drooped in graceful curves. At 
the very top was a blossom — 
six or seven dainty upright 
blades, warm pink, like a maid- 
en’s blush. 

Cautiously, he reached under 
his soaked jacket and drew out 
a small camera. “Damn it. I 
hope the water didn’t get into 


this,” he muttered. He checked 
the setting, raised the camera to 
his face and peered into the view- 
finder, centering on the tree. 

A thing like a steel cable 
whipped around his wrist, knock- 
ing the camera from his grasp. 
“Aha!” a harsh voice growled. 
“Gotcha!” 

This machine had sneaked up 
on him very quietly. It was about 
his own height, but broader, es- 
pecially in the lower body, from 
which four metal legs sprouted, 
ending in big dislike feet with 
soft padding on them. There were 
four tentacles at shoulder height. 
One of them had elongated itself 
to become the steely strand that 
gripped his wrist. The head, atop 
a pipelike neck, was circled with 
beer-bottle eyes and had various 
electronic gear growing from it. 
Kruger jerked futilely to get free. 
He snarled, “Let go, damn it! 
What the hell are you?” 

The thing said indignantly, 
“I’m a robocop. Don’t you see 
my badge? I guess, though, it 
don’t show up so good against my 
stainless steel chest.” 

Kruger blinked. “Oh. Well, for 
heaven’s sake let go of my, er, 
branch. I haven’t done anything.” 

The machine made a sound 
that would go well with a sneer. 
“Don’t pull that on me, Buster. 
We’re not hicks here. The flitbot 
you talked to went back and 
found you gone and saw your

tracks and radioed the alarm. 
Said you talk English. Uh, I talk 
English. Uh, I talk English 
pretty good myself, huh?” 

“Yeah,” Kruger snarled, “good 
as hell. What happens now?” 
“We wait until the flitbot and 
a patrolbot get here. Then we 
have the trial.” 

T he patrolbot was like the 
large wheeled machine Kru- 
ger had seen earlier. It was evi- 
dently present mainly to provide 
physical equipment for the trial. 
It did join, though, in the re- 
cital of basic axioms. 

The three machines inton- 
ed, “ANIMALS WALK ON 
THINGS CALLED FEET.” 
There was a pause, then the 
flitbot said in a kind voice, “You 
may sit down. Prisoner, if your 
feet are tired.” 

Kruger looked around for a 
level spot and lowered himself to 
it. “Thanks. I have been on my 
feet for a long time.” Then he 
saw his mistake and made a 
move to jump up. But it was too 
late. “The hell with it!” 

The flitbot sighed. “It does re- 
alize, subconsciously at least, 
that it’s an animal. Well . .” 
“ANIMALS MAKE ARTI- 
FACTS.” 

The flitbot held up Kruger’s 
camera. “Is this an artifact?” 
Kruger glared. “How the hell 
would I know? I don’t carry a, 


a encyclopedia around with me.” 
The robocop put in, “It’s got 
data engraved on it. It ain’t 
vegetable, animal, mineral or ’bot, 
so I say it’s an artifact.” 

“Very well,” the flitbot said. 
“Next Axiom.” 

“ANIMALS (UGH) EAT 
PLANTS. (ALSO, GOODY! 
SOMETIMES EACH OTH- 
ER.)” 

“Prisoner, do you eat your own 
kind?” 

Kruger jumped to his feet in 
disgust. “Of course not! Look; I 
demand to see the Terran con- 
sul or somebody!” 

“There is no Terran consul 
here. Do you eat minerals? Or 
robots? I thought not. You must, 
then, eat plants.” The flitbot 
sobbed. “Let’s leave the subject. 
Ready:” 

“ANIMALS TAKE OXYGEN 
FROM THE AIR AND PUT 
BACK CARBON DIOXIDE. 
THIS IS THE ONLY GOOD 
THING THEY DO, EXCEPT, 
STRANGELY, ON RARE OC- 
CASIONS, TENDING PLANTS 
OR ROBOTS.” 

The patrolbot suddenly shot 
out grapples and seized Kru- 
ger. “Hey!” he yelled. “What the 
devil — ” A large cylinder of 
clear glass or plastic popped from 
a segment of the big machine. 
The grapples stuffed him in, and 
clamped a lid on. He beat at the 
lid with his fists, but it didn’t

yield. He gave up. Exertion 
would only make him suffocate 
quicker. 

But there were various flexi- 
ble hoses attached to the other 
end of the cylinder. Maybe . 

The lid opened. A grapple 
reached in, seized him by the 
coat collar, hauled him out and 
dumped him on the ground. He 
rolled over and sat up, sput- 
tering. 

“Mm-hm,” the flitbot said, “it 
absorbs oxygen, all right. And 
gives off carbon dioxide. Animal, 
then, by all reasonable tests. 
Agreed?” 

“Agreed,” the other two ma- 
chines chorused. 

The grapples picked him up 
again and lifted him to a flat 
platform atop the patrolbot 
“Damn it,” he yelled, “now what 
are you doing?” 

“Weighing you,” the flitbot 
said. “If we didn’t make abso- 
lutely sure you mass over seven- 
teen grams, some judge some- 
where would doubtless set aside 
the verdict and order a new trial.” 

Finally they put him back 
on the ground. The patrolbot 
said, “It’d make a nice batch of 
fertilizer.” 

The flitbot sighed regretful- 
ly. “I’m afraid we can’t do 
that. This creature is clearly 
insane. Though it knows deep 
down that it’s an animal, its 
behavior shows that on the con- 


scious level it thinks it’s a plant. 
About all we can do is eject it 
with a stem warning. All right?” 
The patrolbot muttered some- 
thing. The robocop said, “Well, 
if you think so.” 

“Patrolbot,” the flitbot said, 
“do your duty.” 

The grapples seized Kruger 
again and held him aloft, shout- 
ing and struggling. The big ma- 
chine turned and rattled to the 
edge of the clearing and along 
a road. At the end of the trip 
Kruger discovered that he’d 
been right about the grapples 
the first time he saw them. 
They could throw a man over 
the fence. 

TJ e limped into town, dis- 
-*■ tributing glares impartially 
to the bizzare assortment of 
aliens who stared at his dis- 
heveled clothing and bare feet. 
Finally he reached a communi- 
cations booth, wedged himself 
into it and pulled the door shut 
violently. He leaned toward the 
pickup and snarled into it, 
“English. Voice transmission on- 
ly; fastest subetheric routing. I 
want the planet Earth, Solar 
System. Terran Department of 
Justice, Interstellar Division, 
Commissioner Stanzlecz. No, I 
won’t spell it. Just put the god- 
dam call through.” 

There was a period of click- 
ing, buzzing, whistling and pop-

ping. Then a sultry contralto 
voice drawled, “Interstellar Di- 
vision. To whom did you wish 
to speak to, please? Whom is 
calling, please?” 

“This is Inspector Kruger. I 
want to speak to the Old Man. 
Who the hell are you ? Another 
new switchboard girl?” 

There was a languid pause. 
Then, “Oh, Inspector Kruger. 
I've heard of ycu. I’m Cherie 
Grapplewell. Just a moment, 
please. I’ll, mm, give you the 
connection you want.” 

He waited. Presently his chief’s 
voice came on. “Kruger, my 
boy! How are you? Every- 
thing hotsy-totsy, I hope? What 
may I do for you?” 

Kruger snarled, “Mainly, I 
wanted to tell you what you 
can do with this job, once I 
get this assignment finished. If 
I ever do.” 

There was a pause. “Gra- 
cious. One of those moods. But 
you sound sober, and that’s 
something. I confess. I can’t 
imagine what’s so difficult about 
finding one stolen tree.” 

Kruger sneered at the pick- 
up. “You can’t, eh? I suppose 
you didn’t know there was any- 
thing out of the ordinary about 
this theft.” 

“Ooh. You are huffy! Of 
course I knew it was an im- 
portant tree. A favorite of a 
planetary ruler, an Emperor 


Brekeke, or something like that. 
But with the photograph we 
gave you, and the leads, I 
thought surely .... Haven’t 
you been able to trace it at 
all?” 

“Hell yes, I’ve been able to 
trace it! I got within fifty yards 
of it. But there hasn’t been one 
hint of who stole it, or where 
he is now. And before I even 
begin to reclaim it, I have to 
take a new photograph and reg- 
ister that with the local authori- 
ties and send copies to the Em- 
peror. He has to certify that it’s 
his tree and that it was stolen 
without his permission, ex- 
pressed or implied, and that if 
it’s extradited it’ll be given a 
good home and not mistreated. 
There’s something damn odd 
about this whole case. Right 
now, the tree’s in a Plant Ref- 
uge, and — ” 

“In a what?” 

“A Plant Refuge, damn it! 
What I called you for is to see 
if you can apply any pres- 
sure anywhere to help me get 
into it legally. Half this planet’s 
forbidden to, uh, animals. I’ve 
been trying all kinds of subter- 
fuge, but ” 

“Kruger! Are you sure you 
haven’t been drinking?” 

Kruger counted to ten in basic 
Anglo-Saxon. Finally he chok- 
ed out, “Just get me some back- 
ing!”

The commissioner said severe- 
ly, “Now see here, Inspector. 
I had my doubts about assign- 
ing you to the job. If there’d 
been anyone available at the 
moment with even a modicum of 
tact or subtlety .... Terragov 
wants very badly to establish 
firmer relations with Emperor 
Brekeke, which is why we’ve un- 
dertaken this little thing for him, 
on the quiet. I warn you I will 
not tolerate any high-handed 
tactics. That planet you’re on 
is in the Moogan Protectorate 
and, heavens, you know how 
delicate our relations with them 
are. 

“I did ask our ambassador 
to see if the Moogans could 
help you. I believe an old friend 
of yours is the Moogan Re- 
gent in that sector. Mum some- 
thing . long name . ” 

Kruger groaned and broke 
the connection. 

He quickly reached for the 
door, but the speaker-grill 
emitted a chime. “Yeah?” 

“Inspector Kruger? Emergen- 
cy Contacts. Please turn on the 
visio pickup.” 

He muttered an oath, but 
complied. There was a gasp 
from the invisible operator. “Oh! 
Is that what humans look like? 
I — I’ve been holding a call 
from Governor-Regent Mum- 
mumnoonoogog. He demands to 
speak to you.” 


TV /Tummumnoonoogog — Mum 
-^’ l -*-for short — was a typical 
Moogan, humanoid but so mus- 
cular he looked like two bodies 
occupying the same space. His 
jaw seemed to thrust out of the 
viewscreen. “There you are! Lis- 
ten, Kruger. I’ve tried to re- 
mind myself you’re just a cop 
trying to do his job. But the 
last time I saw you I wanted 
to make pemmican of you, and 
it wouldn’t take much to re- 
vive the wish. My itinerary 
takes me near there, and I’m 
swinging over especially to see 
if I can catch you at anything. 
Now, I want you to go to your 
hotel and wait. I’ll be there in 
a couple of days. I won’t tell 
you when. And you’d better not 
let me find you more than two 
blocks from your hotel. Under- 
stand?” The Moogan held up 
two truncheonlike fingers. “One, 
two. Two blocks.” 

Kruger tried not to cringe. 
“Yes, sir. Uh, Governor. There’s 
this stolen article, on the planet 
here — ” 

Mum showed a smile that 
would have made a shark shud- 
der. “I don’t care if some- 
body’s stolen the Crab Nebula. 
No nonsense from you, See?” 

“Y-yes, sir. I see.” 

The screen went dark. Kru- 
ger sat a minute staring idly at

his bare feet. They were scratch- 
ed and swollen and muddy. Fin- 
ally he snarled, stood up, left 
the booth and limped toward 
his hotel. 

I t was reassuring, if a little 
painful, to wear shoes again. 
He spent the next forenoon 
limping about the area vouch- 
safed him. He pondered whether 
two blocks might include the far 
sides of the limiting street. Prob- 
ably not, in Mum’s eyes. 

He wandered into an all-spe- 
cies lunchroom and ate, more 
or less — after almost hysteri- 
cally refusing a lovely green 
salad. Then he walked some 
more, scowling at the buildings 
he’d already passed a dozen 
times. Finally he stood on a cor- 
ner, teetering back and forth 
on his sore feet, watching the 
assorted aliens stream by in 
equally assorted vehicles. He 
was about to go back to the 
hotel and get drunk, when a 
hoarse, dry, rather high-pitched 
voice whispered, “Half a mo, 
guvner.” 

He turned, startled. “Uh, I 
beg your pardon. Were you 
speaking to me?” 

What the alien made him 
think of was a fox. Not that it 
could possibly be related to the 
Terran species. For one thing, 
it was tall, even on all fours. Its 
pert, erect-eared, fur -tufted face 


was level with Kruger’s shoul- 
der. And it very very short fore- 
and-aft — as if a fox, mon- 
strously big to begin with, had 
been somehow squeezed together 
and upward until its hind-paws 
stood only inches from the fore- 
paws. But it looked like a fox. 

It winked slyly. “Wasn’t I 
just? Speakin t’ yer, I mean. 
Or praps I has the wrong chap. 
Praps yer eyent Inspector Kru- 
ger spyin’ after the tree wot’s 
been swiped from Is Ighness o’ 
the planet Koshkush. If I has 
the wrong man, I’ll just sye me 
pardons, guvner, an’ be on me 
wye.” The creature made a move. 

“No — wait! I’m Kruger. How 
the devil did you — ” 

The alien winked again. “Oh, 
blokes like me has a wye o’ 
earin things. Wot’s it worth t’ 
yer, t’ ear somethin yer oughter 
know?” 

Kruger studied the sharp fea- 
tures. He had little to lose. 
“How can I tell until I hear it?” 
“Coo, guvner. Eyent we the 
cautious ones? This eyent goin 
t’ cost yer no blinkin fortune. 
I’ll make yer a real bargain, 
sort o’ as a sample o’ me ser- 
vices. Sye ten credits?” 

Wruger shrugged mentally. He 
was on a pretty good expense 
account, this trip. He got out his 
wallet and extracted the neces- 
sary currency. “Here. Now what 
ought I to know?” 


94 


GALAXY 


The alien reached with a long 
foreleg, took the money deftly 
in its paw and tucked it into 
what looked like a natural pouch 
in the fur of his chest. “I’m fair 
obliged, guvner. Ear it is: them 
as stole the Koshkush tree has 
got the wind up. They’re fixin’ 
t’ move it somewheres else on 
the planet. Some plyce visitors 
eyent so blinkin likely to sneak 
in. I wouldn’t doubt they’ll do it 
right after this igh mackamuck 
Mum gets ear, so yer sure t’ be 
occupied. Now. Eyent that 
somethin yer oughter know?” 

Kruger grunted. It certainly 
was. If they did transplant the 
tree somewhere else — the ma- 
chine could undoubtedly do it 
— he might never find it again, 
even if Mum didn’t ship him 
home poste-haste. 

He realized the alien was still 
standing there, as if waiting. He 
eyed it with interest. “Is there 
more?” 

“Might be, guvner. Somethin 
might be done. Cost a bit o’ 
the foldin, though. Guess I’d 
oughter interduce meself. Ray- 
nud Raynud, o’ the planet 
Heath. Bit o’ a dealer, if I 
might sye it. This an that. But 
seein as how yer keyent go 
more than three blocks from 
yer hotel . ” 

“Two.” 

“Two, was it? Coo, things do 
get distorted. Hinders yer activi- 


ties, don’t it? A blinkin pity. 
Course, now, there’s more than 
one blinkin hotel in town, eyent 
there?” 

Something like a small gren- 
ade exploded in Kruger’s mind. 
He reached out and grasped 
a handful of pelt at the alien’s 
shoulder. “I don’t know what 
your idea is, er, Raynud, but 
I like the way you think! Start 
by telling me what hotel to 
move to.” 

The alien grinned. “The fold- 
in, guvner? The foldin?” 

Kruger hesitated only an in- 
stant. “I think we can reach an 
understanding.” 

“Good, now. We has t’ get yer 
within two blocks o me cousin’s 
factory.” 

r | "'he sign outside the factory 
read, “GENERAL ’BOTS, 
LTD.” Kruger stood open- 
mouthed and watch a crew of 
huge creatures like muscular 
land-going octopi put finishing 
touches on a brand-new patrol- 
bot. Five of them seized it, 
roared out in unison, “Yo Ho 
Ho Heave!” and, with an awe- 
some bunching and writhing of 
tentacles, tossed the machine up 
lightly onto a rack. Then, ten- 
tacles flashing, they began put- 
ting on the wheels. 

In ten minutes the thing was 
done. One of the assemblers 
glided liquidly to the tail end 


SPARE THAT TREE

and twisted something. The ma- 
chine came to life. Its beer- 
bottle eyes swiveled. It seemed 
to cringe from the octopi. One 
of the latter — the foreman, 
no doubt, as he’d done no work 
— rumbled something to the 
machine and pointed. It dipped 
its forepart, rolled obediently 
down a pair of rails to the 
ground and rattled over to park 
itself in line with several identi- 
cal machines. 

Raynud Raynud was tugging 
at Kruger’s sleeve. “Come on, 
guvner. Me cousin’s wytin.” 

A n apparent twin of the alien 
greeted them in the office. 
“Delighted, what? Earth, eh? 
Heard a lot about the place. 
Been meaning to pop out and 
have a look-o, when I get the 
chance. Bit of all right, this 
English; and spreading like wild- 
fire. Do you have any other 
languages on Earth?” 

“Uh, well, a few.” 

“Fancy! Well, old chap. Ray- 
nie’s told me about your dif- 
ficulty. Shouldn’t wonder if we 
can just take care of it. Bit of 
a rush, eh? Put the night crew 
on it. Have the thing ready 
bright and early. Never was 
too keen on that Moogan chap, 
anyway. Not soft-spoken at all.” 
Kuger stared out the window 
at the line of motionless patrol- 
bots. “I suppose the two of you 


can estimate the chances better 
than I can. And it’s a lot more 
than I’d hoped for. I was go- 
ing to content myself with a 
good color photograph. Uh, 
you’re sure one of your machines 
can really uproot the tree with- 
out damaging it and bring it 
out?” 

“Oh, no question, old top. 
Special fittings and all that. 
Matter of fact .... But you’re 
not interested in how the dashed 
tree got there in the first place, 
are you. Stick to the present 
game, eh?” The manufacturer 
smiled. “Beastly poor show if 
that Moogan chap breezed in a 
day early, and you popping 
about outside your quarantine.” 
His cousin put in, “Faint 
heart never won no blinkin bar- 
maid, I always sye.” 

Kruger peered harder at the 
machines outside. Something was 
stirring in his mind. “Lots of 
room inside those things?” 
“Oh, ample. Ample.” 

“Uh . would there be room 
for a couch, and maybe a chair? 
And, er, facilities?” 

The manufacturer eyed him. 
“Shouldn’t wonder. Why?” 
“Well, could you install them? 
And paint a sign on the front 
of the machine? I might not 
have to break quarantine.” 

The two aliens were watching 
him narrowly. “How, old chap, 
might that sign read?”

“Refuge Hotel. Weekly rates.” 
Raynud Raynud lifted a fore- 
paw and poked Kruger delight- 
edly in the ribs. “Coo, guvner! 
You eyent half slippery!” 

IV 

I nside the refuge, the false pa- 
trolbot bumped and rattled 
along the road. Kruger, sweating 
at the task of driving, kept 
glancing nervously at the small 
computer-screen before him. If 
some other machine radioed him 
some message, he had to think 
up a quick answer for his own 
vehicle to translate into ’botese. 
He’d passed several robocops 
and flitbots, but beyond casual 
glances they hadn’t paid any at- 
tention. 

He had to admit the Raynud’s 
idea was fundamentally sounder 
than his own earlier one. Why 
disguise yourself as a plant, 
when you could disguise your- 
self as one of the guardian ma- 
chines? 

He rounded a turn and saw 
beside the road a very strange 
creature with a thumb raised in 
an unmistakable gesture. A suit- 
case rested on the ground. 

A t first startled glance, he 
thought the thing was a 
gigantic frog or toad. But it was 
obviously intelligent. He per- 
spired harder. Dare he dare pick 


up a hitchhiker? Dare he, on 
the other hand, pass it by? It 
must be highly privileged, to 
be here at all. 

He braked to a stop and 
opened the hatch. 

It wasn’t until the thing was 
inside that he saw his error. 
He stared in dismay at what 
he’d taken for feet. They were 
roofs. To be sure, they splayed 
out nicely, like toes, but they 
were obviously capable of 
thrusting into the ground, for 
anchorage and sustenance. And 
the rough green skin was . 
bark. 

Perhaps, though, he hoped 
desperately, the .thing wasn’t all 
plant. The eyes and the mouth 
looked almost animal. 

The being eyed him impa- 
tiently. “Well? Are you the 
proprietor? Do you have a vac- 
ancy?” 

Kruger shook himself from his 
trance. “Uh . there’s just 
the one couch . ” 

“Well,” the thing said cold- 
ly, “do I look as if I need two? 
Proprietor or clerk, stir your- 
self and fetch my luggage. If 
it’s payment you’re hesitating 
about, here.” It took from be- 
neath its bark a fat wad of 
orange credit notes, peeled one 
off carelessly and thrust it at 
Kruger. 

Kruger climbed out, hastily 
grabbed the valise, brought it

in and closed the hatch. “I — 
I’m afraid we aren’t very lux- 
urious here. You see, I — ” 

The thing bestowed upon him 
a gracious smile. “Quite all 
right. At least, everything seems 
new and clean. And I’m travel- 
ling quietly, in any case. Don’t 
want to be seen, you know.” 
It settled itself comfortably on 
the couch. “You’re animal, 
aren’t you? I suppose, with the 
scarcity of help . ” 

Kruger climbed back into the 
driver’s seat and sat for a mo- 
ment, blinking. Then, because 
he didn’t know what else to do, 
he drove on. 

His guest was taking a keen 
interest in the manual controls, 
peering past Kruger at them. 
“Fellow, this is a passing strange 
establishment you have here. A 
mobile inn, I can appreciate. 
But why that mishmash of ap- 
parati? What are those three 
hand wheels at the top, for in- 
stance?” 

“Uh, those are the digger con- 
trols, sir.” 

“Digger controls? What in 
heaven’s name has an innkeep- 
er to do with digging?” 

Kruger improvished desperate- 
ly, “Well . you see, sir . 
some of our patrons lack the 
power of locomotion. Sort of, 
you might say, rooted in one 
spot. Ha, ha.” 

“Oh, yes, of course. Hm.” The 


being seemed to ponder for a 
minute. Then it chuckled. 
“Quite. Oh, quite. You can’t 
imagine . ” 

Kruger drove on. Presently 
the vehicle emerged into the 
clearing he sought. He got out 
of his seat and turned — and 
found himself staring into the 
muzzles of a compact but dead- 
ly-looking energy-pistol. 

r T"'he thing that held the weap- 
on stared at him intently 
now. “Just don’t make any fool- 
ish moves, fellow. Do exactly as 
I say, and possibly I’ll let you 
live, though I can’t think why. 
Turn this vehicle around and 
back it slowly toward that tree. 
Start digging it up. Then, han- 
dling it very gently — and I 
hope for your sake you know 
your job well — uproot it and 
stow it on top of this inn or 
vehicle. Or wherever you stow 
things. Then turn around and 
go back the way you came. If 
anything speaks to us, say 
whatever you must to get us un- 
hindered out of this Refuge. 
Falter, and you die.” 

Kruger felt a tide of crim- 
son mounting his face. He let 
out an inarticulate sound. No, 
no; he screamed inwardly. Not 
even I can have luck this bad! 
But he didn’t see how he could 
doubt it. He’d apparently blun- 
dered into the very hands of 


SPARE THAT TREE 


99 


the criminal who’d stolen the 
tree. 

His mind darted about like a 
mouse in a cat’s lair. He stam- 
mered, stalling desperately for 
time, “Uh, the tree from — 
from Koshkush?” 

His captor smiled frigidly. 
“Let us not play games. My 
patience is limited.” 

Slowly, with shaking hands, 
Kruger reached for the steering- 
wheel. What mortified him 
wasn’t so much the desperate 
plight he was in, but that he’d 
been such a complete fool. Well, 
he thought bitterly, it wasn’t the 
first time. But it might be the 
last. He got the vehicle turned 
and backed it toward the tree; 
stopped a few feet away and 
stared unhappily at the digger- 
controls. He’d had precious lit- 
tle instruction. He sighed and 
took hold of a hand-wheel. For- 
tunately, the viewports let him 
see what he was doing. A huge 
awl-like thing rose on its der- 
rick, tilted forward .... 

There was a sound as of 
angry giant hornets. Gobs of 
molten steel exploded from the 
drilling-blade. From a clump of 
bushes at one side of the clear- 
ing, a thing came hopping fran- 
tically, its weapon spitting in- 
candescence. More liquid steel 
rained down. 

The newcomer was a near- 
twin to Kruger’s captor. “Stop!” 


the frantic one bellowed, “Harm 
one leaf of the Princess’ foliage, 
and I’ll — ” 

Kruger could imagine the 
whole patrolbot melted down, 
with him inside. He leaped for 
the hatch, flung it open and 
tumbled out. His erstwhile guest 
came right behind him. Now the 
two alien beings faced each 
other, weapons aimed. 

Then they both went rigid, 
staring at each other. 

“Brekeke!” 

“Keshkoash!” 

Slowly, the newcomer let its 
weapon sag, then thud to the 
ground. “Sire ... I cannot. .” 
Kruger’s captor was trembling. 
In a voice laden with grief, it 
said, “Keshkoash. My most 
trusted liegeman. And I assmued 
you’d perished in a futile de- 
fense of Her Highness.” 

The other — which, Kruger 
now saw, was the more youth- 
ful — hopped slowly to the 
tree and knelt beside its trunk. 
“We love each other, Sire. That 
is my only defense.” 

r T''he tree was quivering and 
-*■ bending. 

Kruger heard his own hoarse 
voice. “P-princess?” 

The Emperor — for it could 
be no other — glanced at him 
absently, then drew itself up and 
bowed. “Accept a monarch’s 
apologies, fellow. I thought you 


100 


GALAXY 


the thief. You must be, instead, 
that detective *rom Earth. Kru 
— Kru — ” 

“K-Kruger.” 

“Ah, yes. Kru-ker. A good 
name. I may award you a bar- 
onetcy, if you can prove there’s 
any noble sap in your capillaries. 
Your superiors messaged me 
that you’d found my daughter, 
and where. I thought I’d best 
hurry on ahead. When my fleet 
gets here . ” 

Kruger was staring at the 
tree. “D-daughter?” 

Brekeke frowned. “Why not? 
Don’t tell me you belong to 
one of these species in which 
the females are hardly disting- 
uishable from the males? Re- 
volting!” 

The tree, which had been 
quivering ever more violently, 
now spoke — apparently by 
vibrating certain branches and 
twigs. Its voice was girlish and 
tearful. “I shall never return 
to Koshkush!” 

Brekeke spun and took an 
angry hop. “What! You dare 
think of defiance?” 

“I won’t!” the tree wailed, “I 
can’t! I’d rather wilt first!” 
“Why?” the emperor roared. 
The blossom atop the tree 
turned crimson. “Because we — 
because I — I’m going to have 
a seed.” 

Brekeke went motionless and 
silent. Slowly, its bark became 


mud -colored. It began to shake. 
A low growl escaped from it. 
It fought for self-control; final- 
ly achieved it. It drew itself 
up and glanced coldly at Kesh- 
koash. “You scoundrel. And 
with all those hungry relatives 
of yours. And the other trouble 
this will cause me. Well . 
it appears I am gelt with my 
own poignard.” It laughed bit- 
terly. “I have not lost a daugh- 
ter. I have gained a grove!” 

Kruger was beginning to real- 
ize that he wasn’t really need- 
ed here, nor safe. Quietly, he 
backed toward his vehicle; turn- 
ed to make a dash .... 

And found his way blocked by 
three genuine machines. 

The flitbot said in exaspera- 
tion, “It’s that crazy animal 
again. And look how upset it’s 
got those plants! Patrolbot, do 
you remember how you tossed it 
over the fence before?” 

“I remember.” 

“Well, do it again. But first, 
let’s send a workbot to build the 
fence up twice as high at that 
point.”

of him was bandaged, but 
there seemed to be no broken

to glare. Sometimes his thick 
hands inched forward, fingers 
flexing hungrily. But he re- 
strained himself. “A whole ar- 
ray of machines gone neurotic,” 
he snarled, “because you dem- 
onstrated that any one of them 
might be a fake. An animal 
spy. The planet Heath threaten- 
ing to quit the Customs Union 
because I’m having to prose- 
cute two of its nationals. Kosh- 
kush on the brink of civil war 
because the Princess broke her 
troth to a powerful duke and 
eloped with some mere baron.” 
Kruger muttered, “I didn’t 
have anything to do with that.”

Mum advanced and thrust his 
face at Kruger’s. “You found 
them. You found them. So long 
as it was assumed she’d mere- 
ly been kidnapped, it was all 
right. Have you any idea what 
this mess is costing Moog? What 
do you think would happen to 
you if I sent Earth the bill?” 
Kruger said, “I’d get fired. 
Please do.” 

The Moogan grunted. “Don’t 
think I wouldn’t love to. But 
you personally are under the 
protection of Emperor Brekeke, 
and, at least until he’s over- 
thrown, he’s a valued ally. As 
a matter of fact, he even sug- 
gested you for a little job of 
sleuthing I have to carry out. 
It might just suit you. The 
Raynud cousins got away. Turns 
out they’ve been smuggling and 
engaging in all sorts of illegal 
things for a long time. Some- 
body’s got to chase them down. 
Do you want the job?” 

Kruger knew better than to 
refuse too hastily, “Well, do you 
have any idea where they went?” 
“Certainly we do. They’re still 
on this planet. They dyed their 
fur green and escaped into one 
of the refuges.” 

Kruger pretended to consider 
it carefully. After a while he 
said, “Mm, no; I think not. 
Thanks. But it would hardly be, 
er, ethical, I’m afraid. Uh, honor 
among thieves.” — C.C. MacAPP

HOWLING DAY

Here's how to crash television. 
All you need is a gimmick — like 
for example the end of the Earth!

Mr. Mort Rydan, 

Fun Town Apartments, 

10049 Sunset Blvd., 

Hollywood, Calif. 

Bravo, Mr. Rydan, bravo! 

Your presentation titled 
“HOWLING DAY” has been 
read with considerable interest 
by all of us here at Midashow 
Productions, Inc. I am sure that 
you are aware how seldom a 
manuscript such as yours, sub- 
mitted by a non-Guild writer 
without an agent, ever gets as far 
as the desk of someone in my po- 
sition. However, there is some- 


thing so uncannily compelling 
about your ms., all the boys 
thought I simply had to see it. I 
want to tell you that the Laugh- 
ing Grasshopper of yours really 
gave us all a big boffo. 

My only wish is that your won- 
derful, truly wonderful concept 
with so many commercial pos- 
sibilities was not so unspeakable. 
Fun is fun, baby. I admit that 
“HOWLING DAY” would get 
the biggest Nielsen any audience 
participation ever got, day or 
prime, but such things can not be. 
If your wish was to gain our 
attention, you certainly have. But 
now let’s stop horsin’ around, as 
they say, and give me something 
we can use. Remember, there are 
a lot of good normal, church-go- 


103 


ing, child-rearing, yes. America- 
loving folks out there, and it is 
up to us to be normal and save 
such good healthy pagan ideas for 
our private lives, right? 

(By the way, are you really 
Richard Belnoir Hastings?) 

The Surprise Disemboweling 
Phonograph the Familiars use on 
the Third Play is particularly 
good. This can be salvaged in 
some way, I feel, and would like 
to discuss this and other matters 
with you. 

There are difficulties inherent 
in the original gizmo, however, 
that give some of us doubts. To 
save anything of the Howling 
Day game, contestants will have 
to be above average both physi- 
cally and brainwise even to last 
until the Flinching Feelers Hop. 
(Should take four min zero — 
right to first commerc. — good.) 
This is of course bad for 
home identification, but more- 
over, there’s a problem of logis- 
tics. Where we going to get them? 
(Howsomever, a good first game 
could be played by the Reverend 
Dr. Billy Graham and some wri- 
ter-scientist like my good friend 
Ray Bradbury, a real gentleman. 
(This ain’t you, Ray?) 

Anyhoo, a meet can iron out 
these problems. Phone, for cris- 
sake. And let’s not play dirty 
with the U.S. Mails, huh? 

With best regards,

My dear Agberg: 

I must call your attention to 
the fact that my submission 
titled Howling Day, mailed June 
1, somehow fell into the hands 
of something called The Midas 
Game, an alleged audience par- 
ticipation program. This certain- 
ly was not the proper place for 
my material, as anyone on Earth 
should be able to see. 

Yours, it was my understand- 
ing, is a leading American com- 
munications network. As such, 
you should exercise the proper 
disposition of material placed in- 
to your hands. 

If Howling Day is not sub- 
mitted to the proper channels 
immediately, a higher authority 
shall hear of this. 

Most sincerely,

Mr. Mort Rydan, 

10049 Sunset, 

L.A. Calif. 

Dear Mort Rydan, 

“Howling Day” is one of those 
rare works of genius a man in 
my position has the electric joy 
of seeing once in a half score of 
years! I’m sure you are all too 
aware of the binding restrictions 
that make it so difficult for us 
in this hurried world of television 
to even glance at unsolicited, un- 
agented scripts, but there was, 
all were agreed, something so 
compellingly unique about your 
work that the closest examina- 
tion of it was demanded. 

Let me say immediately that 
while you and I know that Art is 
total license to the Artist, there 
were creatures who objected to 
Arthur painting his freshly dead 
ex as a “screwy” nympho, just 
so, I feel that if you go talking 
about your “Laughing Grasshop- 
per” in some of the coarser bars 
with people not our sort, you 
may be killed, or at least badly 
beaten. I’d hate for that to hap- 
pen to such a promising young 
man before I got a chance to do 
something with him. 

In the midst of all these good 
sayings, I must interject a nega- 
tive motif. Our anthology series, 
HOWLING DAY 


Analogues oi Alan, has been can- 
celed after the first thirteen 
were put in the can. We all feel 
it was a particularly bitchy thing 
to have happen to us. The Al- 
mighty knows there is little 
enough Art and Drama on the 
boob tube these dark dawnings. 
A clean and true death might 
have been ours, trampled by the 
mindless mobs of the ratings 
race. That is a hurtful death, but 
one that can be comprehended 
in the death throes. But ours was 
the ignominy of being canceled 
on the basis of preview theatre 
audience reactions in Arcadia, El 
Monte and San Diego. 

It was to be our fate to only 
complete those thirteen pro- 
grams, involving but seven pro- 
jects. Included were a two-parter 
of Robinson Crusoe, the first 
realistic treatment with sensitivi- 
ty, and a six-part autobiographi- 
cal odyssey-essay on the young 
American writer, Harlan Ellison, 
prepared with his full co-opera- 
tion. I regret to say that “ How- 
ling Day” could not be one of 
those favored seven. 

However, all is not a total de- 
bit. 

You have the makings of a 
nice little sci-fi pilot here. I 
know — “ Howling Day ” may 
concern interplanetary invasion, 
but it is certainly not science fic- 
tion, you say. But to the average 
viewer it does seem to be science 

105 


fiction. Let him think so. The 
more perceptive will see further. 
Basically, you have to throw in 
a continuing lead, an ostensively 
young hero, rather a latter day 
Captain Video. (Too bad we 
can’t get A1 Hodge — a sweet 
guy (but like a board) but other 
commits, you know.) 

I would be happy to work with 
you on developing this property. 
(I expect to have some free time 
shortly.) As you may have de- 
duced, I have some smashing 
ideas myself. For instance: we 
see immediately — before Pea- 
cock, before teaser, anything — 
the big, simple, beautiful face of 
the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham and 
he is saying directly to us — 
“There are Stranger Things in 
Heaven and Earth than are 
Dreamed . .” And then after 
the teaser, opening credits, first 
commerc, we have another little 
intro by a scientific authority 
(God and Science both on our 
side). Maybe we can get my 
friend, Ray Bradbury, for this. 

It is my fondest wish that we 
meet together at your earliest 
convenience and discuss all, in- 
cluding some trifling legal points. 
We would be unable to show dis- 
embowelment without permission 
of the copyright owners, J’En- 
treat Pharma-products. And I 
trust you have taken the precau- 
tion of copyrighting your ms. or 
at least registering it with the

My dear sir: 

Once again, I have submitted

turned it over your drama sec-

Mr. M. Rydan,

Dear Mr. Rydan, 

Thank you for submittting 
your fine script, “Howling Day” , 
to VVNews Documentaries. We 


GALAXY 


sincerely regret that we cannot 
use this material in its present 
form. 

However, there is something so 
uniquely compelling about your- 
presentation — certainly it had 
to be to reach my desk without 
Guild membership or recognized 
representation — that I feel some 
part of it may still be used in 
some form. 

I wish like hell we had the 
budget to do a full scale docu- 
mentary such as yours. It might 
make a few of the fat-headed 
viewers get off their equally fat 
cans. TV has never equalled the 
effectiveness that an Orson 
Welles could achieve with his In- 
vasion from Mars broadcast. 
Your script, if done right, with- 
out misrepresenting it as fact, 
could reach the same plateau of 
effectiveness. But there is simply 
not the money for it. And, frank- 
ly, I am getting to be an old and 
gray boy wonder, tired of dueling 
windmills. I don’t feel like fight- 
ing the powers that be to con- 
vince them that your disembowel- 
ment scene is totally necessary, 
and all the other grief I would be 
taking on myself. 

The best we can do is present 
some of the — let’s face it, 
— “cleaner” scenes, and com- 
ment on them and discuss them 
on that grand old gimmick, the 
Panel. 

My thinking at the moment is 

HOWLING DAY 


along the lines of doing this a 
Sunday morning on our Near 
God show. This is, you realize, a 
twenty-five minute optional net 
feed, and rates would be accord- 
ing. For the panel discussion be- 
tween selected scenes, we could 
use you (if you’re photogenic 
enough) along with somebody 
for religion’s side of it — Billy 
Graham would be perfect — and 
a contemporary philosopher like 
Ray Bradbury (one of my close 
friends knows him quite well so 
this should be no problem). I 
think this should generate more 
discussion in trade circles than 
any similar show has in a long 
time, although God knows, we 
can’t expect a rating buster. 

I want to meet with you and 
discuss the project just as soon 
as you can possibly make it. 
(Next time, please enclose your 
phone number.) 

By the by, I know “struggling 
young writers” like yourself don’t 
always have a lot of money. I 
could offer you a little extra on 
the side until this all goes 
through. I got kind of a kick out 
of your “Laughing Grasshopper.” 
It is so obscene, it is funny as 
all hell! Could you write me up 
about sixteen pages of a scene 
where the Grasshopper meets a

From the desk cf 
MORT RYDAN 
R. A. Agberg: 

You have utterly failed to 
make the proper use of my sub- 
mission. Howling Day. It should 
be obvious to the stupidest beast 
on Earth that this was not a 
script submitted to your primi- 
tive communications system for 


‘ale. With the best will in the 
world, I offered you an extreme- 
ly detailed advance publicity re- 
lease for whatever use you could 
make of it during the coming in- 
vasion of your world by my peo- 
ple. Naturally, there was no 
charge for this service. 

The time value of the release 
has completely decayed due to 
your bungling. The day you are 
sent howling is here. I feel you 
people will find it as “uniquely 
compelling” in reality as in print!

FORECAST 

Let's suppose the day comes when a man invents a practicable, 
economical time machine. It works perfectly. It can transmit a man, or a 
whole crew of men, as far into the past as you like — complete with 
equipment, rations, reading matter, tents, water-purifiers . complete, 
in short, with anything you went to send. But — 

But it only works one way. You can go a million years into the 
past, or a billion. But you can't travel one nanosecond into the future — 
not even to return from the past. 

That's the situation Robert Silverberg has created for us in next 
issue's lead complete novel, Hawksbill Station. What's the use of that 
kind of time travel? A very practical use, says Silverberg, for Hawksbill 
Station is a prison colony . from which there is no escape, and no 
hope of parole. 

In the same issue, of course, we conclude Poul Anderson's To 
Outlive Eternity — and that's a climax you won't soon forget. We hope 
to squeeze in a non-fact article called Traveler's Guide to MegaHouston; 
there's a Roger Zelazny story called Angel, Dark Angel scheduled, plus 
the usual ration of Ley, Budrys etc. See you then!

THE ADULTS

Illustrated by FINLAY 


True maturity is a deadly gift. 
The aliens had it — and Mankind 
trembled before their presence! 


I 

^^cnesis, Chapter 3 

22 And the Lord God said. Behold, 
the man is become as one of us, 
to know good and evil: and now, 
lest he put forth his hand, and 
take also of the tree of life, and 
eat, and live forever: 

28 Therefore the Lord God sent him 
forth from the Garden of Eden, 
to till the ground from whence 
he was taken. 


24 So he drove out the man; and 
he placed at the East of the Gar- 
den of Eden Cherubims, and a 
flaming sword which turned 
every way, to keep the way of 
the tree of life. 

He sat before an eight-foot cir- 
cle of clear twing, looking end- 
lessly out on a view which was 
less than exciting. 

Even a decade ago those stars 
had been a sprinkling of dull red 


109 


dots in his wake. When he rotat- 
ed the cabin to face forward, they 
would be hellish blue, bright 
enough to read by. To the side, 
the biggest had been visibly flat- 
tened. But now, in all directions 
there were only stars, sparsely 
scattered across a sky that was 
mostly black. This was a lonely 
sky. Dust clouds hid the blazing 
glory of home. 

The light in the center of the 
view was not a star, and it was 
bright enough to have burned 
holes in a man’s retinae. It was 
the light of Phssthpok’s fusion 
drive, burning a bare eight miles 
away. Every few years Pssthpok 
spent some time watching the 
drive, just to be sure it was burn- 
ing evenly. A long time ago he 
had caught a slow, periodic wav- 
ering in time to prevent his ship 
becoming a tiny nova. But the 
blue light had not changed at all 
in the weeks he’d been watching 
it. 

For most of a long, slow life- 
time the heavens had been crawl- 
ing past Phsstpok’s porthole. Yet 
he remembered little of that voy- 
age. The time of waiting had 
been too devoid of events to in- 
terest his memory. It is the way 
the protector stage of the Pak 
species, that one’s leisure mem- 
ories are of the past, when one 
was a child and, later, a breeder, 
when the world was new and 
bright and free of responsibilities. 


Only danger to himself or his 
children can rouse a protector 
from his normal dreamy lassi- 
tude to a fighting fury unsur- 
passed among sentient beings. 

Ohssthpok sat dreaming in his 
disaster couch. 

The cabin’s attitude controls 
were beneath his left hand. A 
food slot was on his right, and 
when he was hungry, which hap- 
pened once in ten hours, his 
knobby hand, like two fistfuls of 
black walnuts strung together, 
would reach into the food slot 
and emerge with a twisted, fleshy 
yellow root the size of a sweet 
potato. Terrestrial weeks had 
passed since Phssthpok last left 
his disaster couch. In that time 
he had moved nothing but his 
left hands and his jaws. His eyes 
had not moved at all. 

Before that there had been a 
period of furious exercise. A pro- 
tector’s duty is always to be fit. 

Even a protector with nobody 
to protect. 

The drive was steady, or 
enough so to satisfy Phssthpok. 
The protector’s knotted fingers 
moved, and the heavens spun 
around him. He watched the 
other bright light float into the 
porthole. When it was centered 
he stopped the rotation. 

Already brighter than any star 
around it, his destination was 
still too dim to be more than a 


110 


GALAXY 



THE ADULTS 


111 



star. But it was brighter than 
Phssthpok had expected, and he 
knew that he had let time slip 
away from him. Too much 
dreaming! And no wonder. He’d 
spent most of twelve hundred 
years in that couch, staying im- 
mobile to conserve Lis food sup- 
ply. It would have been twenty 
times that long but for relativ- 
istic effects. 

Despite what looked to be the 
worst and most crippling case of 
arthritis in medical history, des- 
pite weeks spent like a total par- 
alytic, the knobby protector was 
instantly in motion. The drive 
flame shortened a little, bent a 
little to the right, so that the 
entire ship began to wheel 
around. 

He’d reached the most likely 
region of space; ahead was the 
most likely star. Phssthpok’s mo- 
ment of success was hard upon 
him. The ones he had come to 
help (if they existed at all; if 
they hadn’t died out; if they cir- 
cled this star and not one of the 
less likely) wouldn’t be expect- 
ing him. Their minds were near- 
ly animal; they might or might 
not use fire, but they certainly 
wouldn’t have telescopes. Yet 
they were waiting for him . 
in a sense. If they were here at 
all, they had been waiting for 
half a million years. 

He would not disappoint them. 

He must not. 


A protector v.’ithout descend- 
ants is a being without purpose. 
Such an anomaly must find a 
purpose, and quickly, or die. 
Most die. In their minds or their 
glands a reflex clicks, and they 
cease to feel hunger. Sometimes 
such a one finds that he can 
adopt the entire Pak species as 
his progeny: but then he must 
find a way to serve that species. 
Phssthpok was one of the lucky 
few. 

It would be terrible if he 
failed. 

II 

ick Sohl had gone mining. 

A century ago monopoles 
had been mere t'. eory, and con- 
flicting theory at that. Magnetic 
theory said that a north mag- 
netic pole could not exist with- 
out a south magnetic pole, and 
vice versa. Quantum theory fore- 
told that they might exist in- 
dependently. 

In 2028, when the first perma- 
nent settlements were just be- 
ginning to bloom in the biggest 
Belt rocks, an explorer had found 
north magnetic monopoles scat- 
tered through the metal ore of 
a nickel-iron asteroid with no 
name. 

Nick’s cargo was as large as 
he could handle. One more shov- 
elful (the magnets used to pull 
monopoles out of asteroid iron 



112 


GALAXY 


did look remarkably like shov- 
els) would have started the north 
monopoles beating their way 
through the electromagnetic field 
around his cargo box. He had 
quite a catch for a couple of 
weeks’ backbeating labor. 
Though ninety years had im- 
proved the tools, Monopole min- 
ing was still a one-man opera- 
tion. 

Truth to tell, he’d have been 
satisfied had he found nothing. 
Mining was an excuse the First 
Speaker for the Belt Political 
Section used to escape from his 
cramped office buried deep in 
the rock of Ceres, from the con- 
stant UN-Belt squabbles, from 
wife and children, friends and 
acquaintances and enemies and 
strangers. But it was nice to 
know his secret scource had pan- 
ned out. Nick’s ancestors had 
felt the same about their secret 
fishing holes. 

The load would be worth good 
money at Ceres. A magnetic field 
generated by monopoles acts in 
an inverse linear relationship 
rather than an inverse square. In 
practical terms, a monopole- 
based motor or instrument will 
reach much further. Monopoles 
were valuable where weight was 
a factor, and in the Belt weight 
was always a factor. 

And next year, after the first 
frantic weeks of catching up 
with current events, after the 


next ten months spent manipu- 
lating the politics of the solar 
system, he would be back. And 
the year after that . though 
he couldn’t really count on it. 
The monopoles sources in Sa- 
turn’s rings were a trifle too con- 
spicuous. One year soon he’d 
spend a week crossing space only 
to find Cassini’s Divide jammed 
and alight with fusion-driven 
craft. 

Nick was building up speed 
for the trip to Ceres, with Saturn 
a fantastic bauble behind him, 
when he saw his mining detector 
swing slowly away from the car- 
go box. Somewhere to his left 
was a new and powerful source 
of monopoles. 

An unbelieving grin split his 
face, like lightning across a black 
sky. Two sources! Almost an em- 
barrassment of riches. He didn’t 
need this new one, but he could 
sell it once he’d located it. That 
would take doing. The needle 
wavered between two attractions, 
one of which was his cargo box. 

H e spent twenty minutes fo- 
cussing a com laser on Ceres. 
“This is Nick Sohl, repeat, 
Nicholas Brewster Sohl. I wish 
to register a claim for a mono- 
pole scource in the general direc- 
tion of — ” He looked, tried to 
guess how much his cargo was 
affecting the needle, and named 
a star. “I want to offer this 


THE ADULTS 


113 


source for sale to the Belt gov- 
ernment. Details follow, half an 
hour.” 

He then turned off his fusion 
motor, climbed laboriously into 
suit and backpac and left the 
ship, carrying a telescope and 
his mining detector. 

The stars are far from eternal, 
but for Man they might as well 
be. Nick floated among the eter- 
nal stars, motionless, falling 
toward the tiny sun at tens of 
thousands of miles per hour, and 
knew once again why he went 
monopole mining. The universe 
blazed like diamonds on black 
velvet, an unforgettable back- 
drop for golden Saturn. The 
Milky Way was a jeweled brace- 
let for all the universe. Nick 
loved the Belt, from the carved- 
out rocks to the surface domes 
to the spinning inside-out bub- 
ble worlds; but most of all he 
loved space itself. 

A mile from the ship he used 
scope and detector to fix the 
location of the new source. He 
moved back to the ship to call 
in. A few hours from now he 
could take a new fix and pin the 
scource by triangulation. 

When he reached the ship his 
communicator was alight. The 
thin, fair face of “Little” Shaef- 
fer, Third Speaker, was talking 
to the empty acceleration couch. 

“ — Must call in at once, Nick. 
Don’t wait to take your second 

114 


fix. This is urgent. Martin Shaef- 
fer calling Nick Sohl, repeat 
Martin — ” 

Nick refocused his laser. “Lit, 
I’m truly honored. How can my 
poor find justify your august 
attention? A simple clerk would 
have sufficed.” He set the mes- 
sage to repeat a few times, then 
started putting away tools. Ceres 
was light-minutes distant. 

The answer came. Shaeffer’s 
face was very serious. “Nick, one 
hundred and four miners have 
called in so far to report your 
scource.” He paused, not for an 
answer, but for emphasis. “Think 
about it. Most miners work their 
own mines. If that many called 
in to sell, thousands must have 
decided not to. And they’re all 
across the system. If you’d taken 
your second fix you’d have reg- 
istered two parallel lines.” 

Another pause. “I said we’ve 
had calls from across the system. 
They give us enough parallax to 
locate the scource. It’s one 
scource, all right, and it’s ninety 
A. U. from the sun, two and a 
half times as far as Pluto. You 
can guess how powerful it is. 
Mitchikov says that big a source 
could power a really big inter- 
stellar hydrogen ramscoop. 

“We’ve been following it for 
an hour. Nick, it’s moving 
toward the system at nearly ten 
thousand miles per second. That’s 
way above even intergalactic 


GALAXY 


speeds. We’re all convinced it’s 
an Outsider.” 

“Any comments?” 

“Repeating — ” 

Nick switched it off and sat 
for a moment, stunned. An Out- 
sider! 

O utsider was Belter slang for 
alien; but the word meant 
more than that. The Outsider 
would be the first sentient alien 
to contact the human race. And 
it, singular, would contact the 
Belt instead of Earth, not only 
because the Belt held title to 
most of the solar system but be- 
cause those humans who had 
colonized space were obviously 
more intelligent. There were 
many hidden assumptions in the 
word Outsider, and not every 
Belter believed them all. 

“Nick Sohl calling Lit Shaeffer. 
Yes, I’ve got comments. One, it 
sounds like your assumption is 
valid. Two, will you for Christ’s 
sake stop blasting the news all 
over the system? Some flatlander 
ship might pick up the fringe of 
one of your lasers. Or have we 
decided to bring them in on it? 
Three, I’ll be home in five days. 
Concentrate on getting informa- 
tion. If you have to make de- 
cisions without me, do it, but 
first be sure it’s urgent. Four — ” 
Find out if the jerk is decelerat- 
ing! Find out where he’ll stop! 
But he couldn’t say any of that. 


Until they decided to bring 
Earth in, which they probably 
would not, they would have to 
be careful. Shaeffer would know 
what to do. “There is no Four. 
Sohl out.” 

Ill 

T he solar system is big and, 
in the outer reaches, thin. In 
the main Belt, from slightly in- 
side Mars’ orbit to slightly out- 
side Jupiter’s, a determined man 
can examine a hundred rocks in 
a month. Further out, he’s likely 
to spend a couple of weeks com- 
ing and going, just to look at 
something he hopes nobody else 
has noticed. 

The main Belt is not mined 
out, though most of the big rocks 
are now private property. Most 
miners prefer to work the Belt. 
In the Belt they know they can 
reach civilization and civiliza- 
tion’s vital by-products : stored 
air water and hydrogen fuel, a 
restaurant with human waitress- 
es, a new air regenerator, auto- 
docs and theraputic psychomi- 
metic drugs. 

Brennan didn’t need drags or 
company to keep him sane. He 
preferred the outer reaches. He 
was in Uranus’ trailing trojan 
point, following sixty degrees be- 
hind the big planet in its orbit. 
Trojan points, being points of 
stable equilibrium, are dust col- 


THE ADULTS 


115 


lectors and collectors of larger 
objects. There was a good deal 
of dust here, for deep space, and 
a handful of rocks worth explor- 
ing. 

Had he found nothing at all, 
Brennan would have moved on 
to the moons, then to the leading 
trojan point. Then home for a 
short rest and a visit with Char- 
lotte; and, because his funds 
would be low by then, a paid 
tour of duty on Mercury, which 
he would hate. 

Had he found pitchblende he 
would have been in the point for 
months. 

None of the rocks held enough 
radioactives to interest him. But 
something nearby showed the 
metallic gleam of an artifact. 
Brennan moved in on it, expect- 
ing to find some Belt miner’s 
throwaway fuel tank, but look- 
ing anyway. Brennan was a con- 
firmed optimist. 

This time he was right. The 
artifact was the shell of a solid- 
fuel rocket motor. Part of the 
Mariner XX, from the lettering. 

The Mariner XX, the ancient 
Pluto fly-by. Ages ago the an- 
cient empty shell must have 
drifted back toward the distant 
sun, hit the thin trojan-point 
dust and coasted to a stop. The 
hulk, lightly pitted with dust 
holes, was still rotating with the 
stabilizing impulse imparted 
three generations back. 


As a collector’s item the thing 
was nearly beyond price. Bren- 
nan took photographs of it in 
situ, then moved in to strap it to 
his fusion tube, below his life- 
system cabin. The gyros could 
compensate for the imbalance. 

In another sense the hulk pre- 
sented a problem. 

H e stood next to it on the 
fusion tube’s metal hull. The 
tank was half as big as his min- 
ing singleship, but very light, lit- 
tle more than a metal skin for 
its original shaped-core charge. 
If Brennan had found pitch- 
blende, the singleship would have 
been hung with cargo nets under 
the fuel ring, carrying its own 
weight in radioactive ore. He 
would have returned to the Belt 
at half a gee. But with the Mar- 
iner relic as his cargo he could 
accelerate at the one gee which 
was standard for empty single- 
ships. 

It might just give him the edge 
he’d need. 

If he sold the tank through the 
Belt, the Belt would take thirty 
percent in income tax and 
agent’s fees. But if he sold it on 
the Moon, Earth’s Museum of 
Spaceflight would charge no tax 
at all. 

Brennan was in a good position 
for smuggling. There were no 
goldskins out here. His velocity 
over most of his course would 


116 


GALAXY 


be tremendous. They couldn’t 
begin to catch him until he ap- 
proached the Moon. He wasn’t 
hauling monopoles or radioac- 
tives; the magnetic detectors 
would look right through him. 
He could swing in over the plane 
of the system, avoiding rocks 
and other ships. 

But if they did get him, they’d 
take one hundred percent of his 
find. Everything. 

Brennan smiled to himself. It 
was worth the risk. 

P hssthpok’s mouth closed once, 
twice, three times. A yellow 
tree-of-life root separated into 
four chunks, raggedly, because 
the edges of Phssthpok’s beak 
were not sharp. They were blunt 
and uneven, like the top of a 
molar. Phssthpok gulped four 
times. 

He had hardly noticed the ac- 
tion. It was as if his hand, mouth 
and belly were on automatic, 
while Phssthpok watched the 
scope screen. 

Under 10 4 magnification, the 
screen showed three tiny violet 
points. 

Looking around the edge of 
the scope screen, Phssthpok 
could see only the bright yellow 
star he’d called GO Target #1. 
He’d been searching for planets; 
and he’d found one, a beauty, 
the right size and approximate 
temperature, with a transparent 


atmosphere and an oversized 
moon. But he’d also found my- 
riads of violet points so small 
that at first he’d thought they 
were mere flashes in his retinae. 

They were real, and they 
moved. Some moved no faster 
than planetary objects; others 
hundreds of times faster than es- 
cape velocity for GO Target #1. 
They glowed with an intensely 
hot color, the color of a neutron 
star in its fourth week of life, 
when its temperature is still in 
the tens of billions of degrees. 

Obviously they were space- 
craft. At these speeds, natural 
objects would have been lost to 
interstellar space within months. 
Probably they used fusion drives. 
If so, and judging from their 
color, they burned hotter and 
more efficiently than Phssth- 
pok’s own. 

There were tens of thousands 
of them. 

They seemed to spend most 
of their time in space. At first 
he’d hoped they were some form 
of space-born life, perhaps re- 
lated to the starseeds of the gal- 
actic core. But as he drew nearer 
the yellow sun, he’d had to give 
up the idea. All the sparks had 
destinations, from the myriad 
small orbitting rocks to the 
moons and planets of the inner 
system. One frequent target was 
the double planet with the trans- 
parent atmosphere, the one he’d 


THE ADULTS 


117 


decided might be Pak-habitable. 
No spaceform could have stood 
its gravity or its atmosphere. 

That planet, GO Target #1 - 3, 
was the biggest such target. 

If the pilots of those fusion 
craft had developed on GO Tar- 
get #1 - 3, they would naturally 
prefer lighter gravities to heav- 
ier. 

But the ones he sought hadn’t 
the minds to build such craft. 
Had something, something alien, 
usurped their places? 

Then he and his thousands 
had given their long lives to ex- 
tract only a sterile vengeance. 

It needn’t be that. GO Target 
#1 was not the only likely sun. 
Probability was only twenty- 
eight percent. He could hope 
that the ones he had come to 
help circled another possible 
star. But he’d have to check. 

Centered in the great twing 
porthole was a steady point of 
blue-white light. It grew, but un- 
like the other sparks, it did not 
shift. Phssthpok was matching 
its course. 

y^Jick docked his ship on the 
-I 'N surface of Ceres, hurriedly 
issued orders for unloading and 
sale of his cargo, and went un- 
derground. His office was some 
four miles beneath the pitted, 
bubble-dotted surface, buried 
deep in the nickel-iron core. 

Lit Shaeffer’s suit and helmet 


were hanging in the vestibule 
of his office. Nick grinned fleet- 
ingly at the sight. He always 
did. 

Most Belters wore suits with 
personalized decorations. Why 
not? The interior of his suit was 
the only place many a Belter 
could call Home, and it was the 
one possession he had to keep 
in perfect condition. But even 
in the Belt, Shaeffer’s suit was 
unusual. 

On an orange background was 
the painting of a girl. She was 
short, for her head barely reach- 
ed Lit’s neck ring, and her skin 
was a softly glowing green. Only 
her lovely back showed across 
the front of her suit. Her hair 
was streaming bonfire flames, 
flickering orange with touches of 
yellow and white, darkening in- 
to red-black smoke as it swept 
across the suit’s left shoulder. 
She was nude, and she had both 
arms wrapped around the chest 
of the suit, her hands touching 
the airpac on the back; her legs 
wrapped around the suit’s thighs, 
so that her heels touched the 
backs of the flexible metal knee 
joints. It was a very beautiful 
painting, so beautiful that it al- 
most wasn’t vulgar. A pity the 
suit’s sanitary outlet wasn’t 
somewhere else. 

Sometimes Nick wondered. 
Had Marda known about that 
suit when she married Lit? 


118 


GALAXY 


He entered his office, dropped 
into his chair and closed his eyes 
for a moment, ignoring Lit in 
one of the guests’ chairs, getting 
used to the feel of being First 
Speaker again. With his eyes 
still closed he said, “Okay, Lit. 
What’s been happening?” 

“Got it all here,” Rustle of 
papers. “Yah The monopole 
scource is coming in over the 
plane of the solar system, aimed 
at the sun. As of an hour ago it 
was one billion eight hundred 
and seven million miles out. For 
the past week it’s shown a steady 
deceleration of point nine two 
gee. At that rate it’ll stop at 
Earth’s orbit in five days.” 

Nick opened his eyes. “Where 
will Earth be then?” 

Lit looked grim. His gaunt 
mahogany face was built for it. 
“About six feet away. We 
checked.” 

“Hardly fair. The Outsider’s 
supposed to contact us, not them. 
What have you done about any- 
thing?” 

“Nothing concrete. Just plans 
and observations. We’ve got 
photos of what looks like a drive 
flame.” 

“Fusion? Chemical? Ion?” 
“Fusion, but much cooler than 
ours.” 

“Can we contact that ship be- 
fore it reaches Earth?” 

“Yah. Mitchikov has several 
courses plotted. Our best bet is 


to start a fleet from the trailing 
Jupiter Trojans in about — ” 
“Not a fleet. We want to look 
harmless to this bird — assum- 
ing he can think, which we may 
as well. Do we have any big 
ships in the Trojans?” 

“The Blue Ox. She was about 
to leave for Juno, but I com- 
mandeered her and had her car- 
go tank cleared.” 

“Good. Nice going.” The Blue 
Ox was a mammoth fluid cargo 
carrier, as big as one of the Titan 
Hotel’s luxury liners, though 
not as pretty. “We’ll want a com- 
puter, and a good one. Also a 
computer tech, and some spare 
senses for the machine. I want 
to use it as a translator, and the 
damn Outsider might talk by 
eye-blinks or radio or modulated 
current. Can we maybe fit a 
singleship into the Ox’s cargo 
hold?” 

“What for?” 

“Just in case. We’ll give the 
Ox a lifeboat. If the Outsider 
plays rough somebody might get 
away.” 

“He doesn’t look dangerous. 
The drive flame is cool, about 
the temperature of the first fu- 
sion drives, before we had crys- 
tal-zinc fusion tubes.” 

“But he crossed interstellar 
space. Why take chances? Make 
sure there’s a scope on him at 
all times from now on. Now let’s 
see if we can call Achilles.”

Some part of his mind reflect- 
ed that Shaeffer had anticipated 
all his needs, had even guessed 
that he might want to use the 
Blue Ox. Shaeffer was good. 
Someday he’d have Sohl’s job. 
If you had to be a politician you 
might just as well be a darn good 
one. 

It would take awhile for the 
operator to focus a laser on 
Achilles. Nick hung up to wait. 
And the phone went off jarring- 
ly in his hand. 

“Yes?” 

“This is Traffic Control,” said 
the phone. “Cutter. Your office 
wanted everything concerning 
the big monopole scource.” 

Nick opened the volume con- 
trol so Shaeffer could hear. 
“Right. What?” 

“It’s matching course with a 
Belt ship. The pilot doesn’t seem 
to be evading contact. They’ll 
be alongside in six hours.” 

Sohl’s lips tightened. “What 
kind of ship?” 

“The scope man didn’t say. 
Probably a mining singleship. 
Shall I call back and try to find 
out?” 

“Get all the information he’s 
got. Set nearby telescopes on 
watch. I don’t want to miss any- 
thing.” Nick rang off. “You 
heard?” 

“Yah. Finagle’s First Law.” 

“Can we stop that Belter?” 

“I doubt it.” 


I t could have been anyone. It 
turned out to be Jack Bren- 
nan. 

He was several hours from 
turnover en route to Earth’s 
Moon. The Mariner XX’s dis- 
carded whistlejet rode his hull 
like an undernourished Siamese 
twin. Its whistle was still fixed 
in the blunt nose, the whistle 
whose pitch had controlled the 
rate at which the core burned. 
Brennan had crawled inside to 
look, knowing that a damaged 
whistle might lower the relic’s 
value. 

For a used one-shot, the relic 
was in fine shape. The nozzle 
nad burned a little unevenly, 
but not seriously so; naturally 
not, for the Mariner XX had 
reached its destination. The 
Museum of Spaceflight would 
pay plenty for it. 

In the Belt smuggling is il- 
legal, but not immoral. Smug- 
gling was no more immoral to 
Brennan than forgetting to pay 
a parking meter would have 
been to a flatlander. If you got 
caught you paid the fine and that 
was it. 

Brennan was an optimist. He 
didn’t expect to be caught. 

He’d been accelerating for four 
days at just short of one gee. 
The Uranus orbit was far behind 
him, the flatland system far 
ahead. He was going at a hell 
of a clip. There were no observ- 


120 


GALAXY 


able relativity effects, he wasn’t 
going that fast, but his watch 
would need resetting when he 
arrived. 

Have a look at Brennan. He 
masses one hundred and seventy - 
eight pounds per one gee, stands 
six feet two inches tall. Like any 
Belter, he looks much like an 
undermuscled basketball player. 
Since he’s been sitting in that 
control couch for most of four 
days, he’s beginning to look and 
feel crumpled and weary. But 
his brown eyes are clear and 
steady, twenty-twenty, having 
been corrected by microsurgery 
when he was eighteen. His 
straight dark hair is a strip of 
foliage running across a brown 
polished scalp. Since he’s Cau- 
casian, his Belter tan is no dark- 
er than cordovan leather; as us- 
ual it covers only his hands and 
his face and scalp above his neck. 
Elsewhere he is the color of a 
vanilla milkshake. 

He is forty-five years old. He 
looks thirty. Gravity has been 
kind to the muscles of his face, 
and growth salve to the poten- 
tial bald patch at the crown of 
his head. But the developing fine 
lines around his eyes, stand out 
clearly now, since he has been 
wearing a puzzled frown for the 
past twenty hours. 

Something was following him. 

At first he’d thought it was a 
goldskin, a Ceres cop. But what 


would a goldskin have been do- 
ing that far from the sun? 

Even at second glance it 
couldn’t have been a goldskin. 
Its drive flame was too fuzzy, 
too big, not bright enough. At 
third glance, which included a 
few instrument readings, Bren- 
nan realized that it must have 
come from beyond Pluto. Bren- 
nan was accelerating, but the 
stranger was decelerating and 
still had enormous velocity. 
Either it was from beyond Pluto, 
or its drive generated tens of 
gees. Which gave the same an- 
swer. 

The stranger was an Outsider. 

How long had the Belt been 
waiting for him? Let any man 
spend sufficient time between 
the stars, even a flatland moon- 
ship pilot, and someday he would 
realize just how deep the uni- 
verse really was. Billions of light- 
years deep, with room for any- 
thing at all. Beyond doubt the 
Outsider was out there some- 
where: the first alien species to 
contact Man was going about 
its business beyond the reach of 
the Belt telescopes. 

N ow the Outsider was here, 
matching courses with Jack 
Brennan. 

And Brennan wasn’t even sur- 
prised. Wary, yes, even frighten- 
ed. But not surprised, not even 
that the Outsider had chosen 


THE ADULTS 


121 


him. That was an. accident of 
fate, dependent on the Outsider’s 
origin and drive systems and on 
Brennan’s finding a lost relic of 
the early space age. 

Call the Belt? The Belt must 
know already. Brennan’s mono- 
pole detector was having cat fits. 
Even without that, the Belt tel- 
escope net tracked every ship in 
the system; the odds were that 
it would find any wrong-colored 
dot moving at the wrong speed. 
Brennan had expected them to 
find his own ship, had hoped 
they wouldn’t find it soon 
enough. Certainly they’d found 
the Outsider. Cerainly they were 
watching it: and by virtue of 
that fact they must be watch- 
ing Brennan too. In any case 
Brennan couldn’t laser Ceres. A 
flatland ship might pick up the 
fringes of the beam. Brennan 
didn’t know the Belt policy on 
letting Earth meet Outsiders. 
That policy had never been 
tested. 

The Belt must make its own 
decisions. 

Which left Brennan with two 
of his own. 

One was easy. The Belt must 
have found him now, through 
the intervention of the Outsider. 
That changed the odds. Brennan 
was no longer a smuggler. There- 
fore he must alter course to 
reach one of the major asteroids, 
and he must call the Belt the 


first chance he had to advise 
them of his course. 

But what of the Outsider? 

Evasion tactics? Easy enough. 
Axiomatically, it is impossible to 
stop a ship in space. A cop can 
match course with a smuggler, 
but he cannot make an arrest 
unless the smuggler cooperates 
— or runs out of fuel. He can 
blow a ship out of space, or even 
ram with a good autopilot; but 
how can he connect airlocks with 
a ship that keeps firing its drive 
in random blasts? Brennan could 
head anywhere, and all the Out- 
sider could do was follow or 
destroy him. 

Running would be sensible. 
Brennan did have a family to 
protect. He and Charlotte had 
had two daughters. Brennan had 
paid the customary fee in trust 
each time; his daughters would 
be raised and educated. But he 
could do more for them. Or he 
could become a father again; 
probably with Charlotte. There 
was money strapped to his hull. 
Money was power. Like electrical 
or political or psychic power, its 
uses could take many forms. 
Charlotte, of course, could take 
care of herself; she was an adult 
Belter, hence a self-sufficient in- 
dividual. 

If he contacted the alien lie 
might never see her again. There 
was risk in being first to meet 
an alien species. 


122 


GALAXY 


And, of course, obvious honors. 

Could history ever forget the 
man who met the Outsider? 

That decided him; that and his 
natural optimism. Brennan held 
his course. Let the Outsider come 
to him. 

ry'he Belt is a web of telescopes. 

Hundreds of thousands of 
them. 

It has to be that way. Every 
ship carries at least one tele- 
scope. Every asteroid has to be 
watched constantly, because a 
map of the solar system has to 
be up-to-date by seconds. The 
light of every fusion drive has to 
be watched. Because ships can 
run through each others’ ex- 
hausts if someone doesn’t warn 
them away; and the exhaust of 
a fusion motor is deadly. 

Nick Sohl kept glancing up 
at the screen, down at the stack 
of dossiers on his desk, up at the 
screen. The screen showed two 
blobs of violet light, one bigger 
than the other, and fuzzy. Al- 
ready you could get them both 
on the same screen, because the 
asteroid taking the pictures was 
nearly in line with their course. 

He’d read the dossiers several 
times. Ten of them; and each 
represented a man who might be 
the man, the unknown Belter 
now approaching the Outsider. 
There had been a dozen dossiers. 
In the outer offices men were 


trying to locate and eliminate 
these ten as they had already 
found two, by phone calls and 
com lasers and dragnets. 

Since the guy wasn’t running, 
Nick privately eliminated six of 
the dossiers. Two had never been 
caught smuggling: the mark of 
an overcautious man, regardless 
of whether he’d never smuggled 
or never been caught. One was 
a xenophobe. Three were old- 
timers; you don’t get to be an 
old-timer in the Belt by taking 
foolish chances. In the Belt, the 
Finagle Laws and Murphy Con- 
stants are only half a joke. 

One of four miners was about 
to meet the Outsider. 

Which? 

IV 

A million miles short of Jupit- 
er’s orbit, moving well above 
the plane of the solar system, 
Phssthpok matched velocities 
with the native ship and began 
to close in. 

Of the thousands of sentient 
species in the galaxy, Phssthpok 
and Phssthpok’s race had stud- 
ied only their own. They had 
never been interested in anything 
but Pak. A protector’s intelli- 
gence was high; but intelligence 
is a tool to be used toward a 
goal, and goals are chosen from 
instinct. 

Phssthpok was working strict- 

123 


THE ADULTS 


ly from ignorance. All he could 
do was guess. 

At a guess, then, and assum- 
ing that the oval scratch in the 
native’s hull was really a door, 
the native would be not much 
taller and not much shorter than 
Phssthpok. Say, three to ten feet 
tall, depending on how much 
“elbow room” it needed. Of 
course the oval might not be 
designed for the native’s longest 
length, as for the biped Phsst- 
pok. But the ship was small; it 
wouldn’t hold something too 
much larger than Phssthpok. 

He’d need just one look at the 
native. If it were not a Pak, he 
would need to ask it questions. 
If it were — 

There would still be questions, 
many of them. But his search 
would be over. A few ship’s days 
to reach GO Target #1-3, a 
short time to learn their language 
and explain how to use what 
he’d brought, and he could stop 
eating. 

It showed no awareness of 
Phssthpok’s ship. A few minutes 
and he would be alongside, yet 
the stranger made no move — 
cancel. The native had turned 
off its drive. Phssthpok was be- 
ing invited to match courses. 

Phssthpok did. He wasted 
neither motion nor fuel; he might 
spend his whole life practicing for 
this. His lifesystem coasted along- 
side the native ship and stopped. 


His pressure suit was on, but 
he made no move. Phssthpok 
dared not risk his own person, 
not when he was so close to vic- 
tory. If the native would only 
step out on the hull . 

B rennan watched the ship come 
alongside. 

It was like no ship he’d ever 
seen. There were three small cap- 
sules spaced eight miles apart. 
He saw no cable joining them; 
it must have been invisibly thin. 
Section one was the drive, a long, 
thick cylinder with three fusion 
plants jutting at angles. Big as 
it was, the cylinder must be too 
small to contain fuel for an in- 
terstellar joyride. Either the 
Outsider had dropped expend- 
able tanks along the way, or he 
had developed a ramscoop mag- 
netic field for picking up inter- 
stellar hydrogen. Probably the 
latter. Monopoles would be vital 
in a ramscoop, and the Outsider 
was loaded with monopoles. 

Section two was a sphere some 
sixty feet across, mounted on 
gymbals. When the ship finally 
stopped moving, this section was 
directly opposite Brennan. A 
large circular window stared out 
of that sphere, bulging a little, 
making the sphere look like a 
great eyeball. The eyeball turned 
to follow Brennan as it moved 
past. Brennan found it difficult 
to match that uncanny stare. 


124 


GALAXY 


He was beginning to have sec- 
ond thoughts. Surely the Belt 
could have planned a better 
meeting than this . 

The trailing pod — he’d got- 
ten a good look at it as it went 
by. It was egg-shaped and 
smooth, perhaps sixty feet long 
by forty feet through. The big 
end, facing away from the drive 
section, was so uniformly pitted 
with dust grains that it looked 
sandblasted. The small end was 
pointed and smooth, almost 
shiny. Brennan nodded to him- 
self. A ramscoop would have 
protected the small end during 
acceleration. During deceleration 
its trailing position would have 
done the same. 

There were no breaks in the 

egg- 

It was, thought Brennan, a 
peculiar way to build a ship. The 
center pod must be the lifesys- 
tem, because it had a porthole 
and the trailing pod did not. 
And the drive was dangerously 
radioactive ; otherwise, why 
string the ship out like this? 
But that meant that the lifesys- 
tem would protect the trailing 
pod from the drive radiation. 
Whatever was in that trailing 
pod must be more important 
than the pilot ... in the opinion 
of the pilot. 

Unless the pilot and the de- 
signer had both been inept or 
insane. 


The Outsider ship was motion- 
less, its drive growing cold, its 
lifesysiem a few hundred feet 
away. Brennan waited. 

I’m being chauvinistic, he told 
himself. I can’t judge an alien’s 
sanity by Belt standards, can I? 

Sure I can. That ship is bad 
designing. 

The alien stepped out onto its 
hull. 

Every muscle in Brennan jerk- 
ed as he saw it. The alien was 
a biped; it looked human enough 
from here. But it had stepped 
through the porthole. It stood 
on its own hull, motionless. 

It had two arms, two legs, one 
head. It used a pressure suit. It 
carried a weapon or a reaction 
pistol; there was no way to tell. 
But Brennan saw no rocket 
backpac. A reaction pistol takes 
a good deal more skill. Who’d 
use one in open space? 

Of course. For Brennan. 

F or a wild moment he consid- 
ered starting the drive now, 
get the hell away before it was 
too late! Cursing his fear, Bren- 
nan moved deliberately to the 
door. The men who built the 
singleships had built as cheaply 
as possible. His ship had no air- 
lock; there was just the door 
and pumps to evacuate the life- 
system. Brennan’s suit was tight. 
All he had to do was open the 
door. 


THE ADULTS 


125 


He opened the door and step- 
ped out on sandal magnets. 

The seconds stretched away 
as Brennan and the Outsider ex- 
amined each other. It looks hu- 
man enough, Brennan thought. 
Biped. Head on top. But if it’s 
human, and if it’s been in space 
long enough to build a starship, 
it can’t be as inept as this ship 
says it is. 

Have to ask it what it’s carry- 
ing. Maybe it’s right. Maybe its 
cargo is worth more than its lift. 

The Outsider jumped. 

It fell toward him like a fal- 
con diving. Brennan stood his 
ground, frightened, but admiring 
the alien’ skill. The alien didn’t 
need its reaction pistol. Its jump 
had been perfect. It would land 
right next to Brennan. 

The Outsider hit the hull on 
springy limbs, absorbing its mo- 
mentum like an experienced 
Belter. Brennan saw dimly 
through its faceplate. He recoil- 
ed, actually took a step back- 
ward. The thing was ugly, hide- 
ously ugly. Chauvinism be 
damned: the Outsider’s face 

would stop a computer. 

The one backward step didn’t 
save him. 

The Outsider was too close. It 
reached out, wrapped a pressur- 
ized mitten around Brennan’s 
wrist and jumped. 

Brennan gasped and, too late, 
tried to jerk away. The Outsid- 


er’s grip was like spring steel in- 
side its glove. They were spin- 
ning away through space toward 
the eyeball-shaped lifesystem, 
and there was not a thing Bren- 
nan could do about it. 

447\Tick.” said the intercom. 

i >1 “Here,” said Nick Sohl. 
He’d left it open. 

“The dossier you want is la- 
beled ‘Jack Brennan.’ ” 

“How do you know?” 

“We called his woman. He has 
only one, and two kids. We had 
to convince her it was urgent, 
but she finally told us he’d gone 
off to search the Uranus trojans 
points.” 

“That ties in. Thanks, Cutter. 
Do something for me.” 

“Sure. Official?” 

“Yes. See to it that my ship 
is fueled and provisioned and 
kept ready until further notice. 
Fit it with solid strap-ons. Then 
get a com laser focused on the 
U. N. and keep it focused. 
You’ll need three, of course.” 
For relays as the Earth rotated. 
“Okay.” 

Nick reached for the dossiers. 
The situation was so damn fluid 
that it was well to be ready for 
anything, even the need for 
Earth’s help. If he needed the 
flatlanders, he’d need them bad- 
ly and quickly. The surest way 
to convince them would be to go 
himself. The First Speaker had

never touched Earth, had never 
expected to and didn’t now; but 
The Perversity of the Universe 
Tends Toward a Maximum. 

Too bad Brennan had children. 
Nick began to skim his dossier. 

I jhssthpok’s first clear mem- 
ories dated from the day he 
woke to the fact that he was a 
protector. He could conjure 
blurred memories from before: 
of pain, fighting, discovering new 
foods, experiences in sex and af- 
fection and hate and tree climb* 
ing in the Valley of Pitchok; 
watching curiously, half a dozen 
times, as various female breeders 
bore children he could smell 
were his. But his mind had been 
vague then. As a protector he 
thought sharply and clearly. 

At first it had been unpleasant. 
He had had to get used to it. 
There had been others to help 
him. teachers and such. 

There was a war, and he had 
graduated into it. Because he 
had to develop the habit of ask- 
ing questions, it had been years 
before he understood just what 
had started it. 

Three centuries earlier several 
hundred major Pak families had 
allied to refertilize a wide desert 
area of the Pak world. The 
heartbreakingly difficult task 
had been completed a generation 
ago. Immediately and predict- 
ably the alliance had split into 


several smaller alliances, each 
determined to secure the land 
for its own descendants. By now 
most of the earlier alliances were 
gone. A number of families had 
been exterminated, and the sur- 
viving groups changed sides 
whenever expedient to protect 
their blood lines. Phssthpok’s 
blood line now held with South 
Coast. 

War, Phssthpok found, was 
immensely enjoyable. Not be- 
cause of the fighting. As a breed- 
er he’d had fights, and war was 
not as much a matter of fighting 
as of outwitting the enemy. At 
its start, the war had been fus- 
ion-bomb war. Many of the fam- 
ilies had died during that phase, 
and part of the reclaimed desert 
became desert once again. Then 
South Coast had found a damper 
field to prevent fissionables from 
fissioning. Others had swiftly 
copied it. Since then the war had 
been artillery, poison gas, bac- 
teria, psychology, even infantry. 
It was a war of wits. Could 
South Coast counteract propa- 
ganda designed to split off the 
Meteor Bay region? If Eastersea 
Alliance had an antidote to river 
poison Iota, would it be faster 
to steal it from them or invent 
our own? If Circle Mountains 
should find an innoculation for 
bacteria] strain Zeta-three, how 
likely was it they’d turn a mutat- 
ed strain against us? Should we 


128 


GALAXY 


stick with South Coast, or could 
we do better with Eastersea? It 
was fun. 

Until, forty years after Phssth- 
pok became a protector, Easter- 
sea Alliance built a pinch field 
generator which could set off a 
fusion reaction without previous 
fission. 

The war ended in a week. 
Eastersea had the recultivated 
desert, the part that wasn’t bare 
and sterile from seventy years 
of war. And there had. been a 
mighty flash over the Valley of 
Pitchok. 

The pups and breeders of 
Phssthpok’s line had lived in the 
Valley of Pitchok for unremem- 
bered generations. He’d seen that 
awful light on the horizon and 
known that all his descendants 
were dead or sterile, that he had 
no blood line left to protect, that 
all he could do was to stop eating 
until he was dead. 

H e hadn’t felt that way since. 
Not until now. 

But even then, thirteen centu- 
ries ago in biological time, he 
hadn’t felt this awful confusion. 
What was this pressure-suited 
thing at the end of his arm? It 
looked like one of those he’d 
come to save, as far as he could 
tell from the shape of the suit. 
But those — they couldn’t have 
built ships or pressure suits. 
Phssthpok’s sense of mission 


had held steady for more than 
twelve centuries. Now it was 
drowning in pure confusion. 

But wait! He knew nothing of 
other intelligent species, besides 
the theoretical certainty that 
they existed. The biped form 
might not be unique to Pak. 
Why should it be? Phssthpok’s 
shape was good designing. If he 
could see this native without its 
suit . 

They landed next to the port- 
hole. The Outsider’s aim was in- 
humanly accurate. Brennan 
didn’t try to fight as the Outsid- 
er reached through the surface 
of the porthole, grasped some- 
thing and pulled them both in- 
side. The transparent material 
resisted movement, like a layer 
of non-stick tar with air on both 
sides. 

In quick, jerky movements, 
the alien stripped off its pressure 
suit. The suit was flexible fabric, 
including the transparent bubble; 
there were drawstrings at the 
joints. With its suit off, but still 
maintaining its iron grip on 
Brennan, the alien turned to look 
at him. 

Brennan wanted to scream. 

The thing was all knobs. Its 
arms were longer than human, 
with a single elbow joint in 
something like the right place; 
but the elbow was a ball seven 
inches across. The hands were 
like strings of walnuts. The 


THE ADULTS 


129 


shoulders and the knees and the 
hips bulged like cantaloupes. The 
head was a tilted melon on a 
nonexistent neck. Brennan could 
find no forehead, no chin. The 
alien’s mouth was a flat, black 
beak, hard but not shiny, which 
faded into wrinkled skin half- 
way between mouth and eyes. 
Two slits in the beak were the 
nose. Two human-looking eyes 
were protected by not at all hu- 
man-looking masses of deeply 
convoluted skin and by a pro- 
jecting bony shelf of brow. From 
the beak, the head sloped back- 
ward as if streamlined. A bony 
ridge rose from the swelling 
skull, adding to the impression 
of streamlining. 

The hands were adorned with 
five short fingers tipped with re- 
tractible claws. They felt like 
ball bearings pressing deep into 
the skin of Brennan’s arm. 

Thus, the Outsider. Not mere- 
ly an obvious alien. Come to 
that, a dolphin was an obvious 
alien, but there was nothing hor- 
rible about a dolphin. The Out- 
sider was horribly alien. It 
looked like a cross between hu- 
man and . something else. 
Man’s monsters have always 
been that. Think of the mer- 
maid, now considered funny, 
originally considered a horror: 
all lovely enticing woman above, 
all scaly monster beneath. And 
that fitted too, for the Outsider 


was apparently sexless, with 
nothing but folds of armorlike 
skin between its legs. 

The inset eyes, human as an 
octopus eye, looked deep into 
Brennan’s own. 

Abruptly, before Brennan 
could move to fight back, the 
Outsider took two handfuls of 
Brennan’s rubberized suit and 
pulled them apart. The suit held, 
stretched, then ripped from 
crotch to chin. Air puffed, and 
Brennan felt his ears pop. 

N o point in holding his breath. 

Several hundred feet of 
vacuum separated him from his 
ship’s breathing air. Brennan 
sniffed cautiously. 

The air was thin, and it car- 
ried a strange scent. 

“You son of a bitch,” said 
Brennan. “I could have died.” 
The Outsider didn’t answer. It 
had stripped off Brennan’s suit 
like peeling an orange, without 
unnecessary roughness but with- 
out excessive care. Still its hand 
attached it to Brennan like a 
ball-and-chain. It wore nothing 
more than a vest with big pock- 
ets, a human-seeming garment 
as strange on the Outsider as a 
snap-brim fedora on Franken- 
stein’s monster. Its skin was like 
leather armor. 

The alien’s gaze moved over 
Brennan, feet to head, head to 
feet, insultingly familiar. In the 


130 


GALAXY 


regions of the Belt where air and 
temperature were controlled, the 
Belters practiced nudismi all their 
lives. Never before had Brennan 
felt naked. Not nude, but naked. 
Defenseless. Alien fingers reach- 
ed to probe his scalp along the 
sides of the Belter crest; mas- 
saged the knuckles of a human 
hand, testing the joints beneath 
the skin. At first Brennan fought 
furiously. He couldn’t even dis- 
tract the alien’s attention. Then 
he waited, limp with embarrass- 
ment, enduring the examination. 

Abruptly it was over. The 
knobby alien jumped across the 
room, dug briefly into a bin 
along one wall, removed a big, 
plastic bag. Brennan thought of 
escape; but his suit was in rib- 
bons. The alien ran fingers along 
the bag, and the bag popped 
open as if he’d used a zipper. 

The alien jumped at Brennan, 
and Brennan jumped away. It 
bought him nearly thirty seconds 
of relative freedom. Then knob- 
by steel fingers closed on him 
and pushed him gently into the 
sack. 

Brennan found he couldn’t 
open it from inside. “I’ll suffo- 
cate!” he screamed. The alien 
made no response. It wouldn’t 
have understood anyway. It was 
climbing back into its suit. 

Oh, no, thought Brennan. He 
struggled to rip the bag. 

The alien picked up the bag 


and moved out through the port- 
hole. Brennan felt the bag puff 
out around him, thinning the air 
inside even further. He stopped 
struggling instantly. He waited 
with the fatalism of despair 
while the alien moved around 
the eyeball-shaped hull to where 
an inch-thick line of smooth 
plastic stretched away in the 
direction of the trailing pod. 

B rennan was all alone in a 
small space. 

The Outsider was gone. It had 
jumped into space with the Bren- 
nan-bag, balanced itself against 
the bag and used its reaction pis- 
tol. The trip had taken twenty 
minutes. Brennan had been near 
suffocation when they finally 
arrived at the trailing pod. 

The Outsider had touched 
some small tool to the hull, then 
pulled them both through a vis- 
cous surface that looked like 
metal from both sides. It had 
unzipped the bag, turned and 
jumped and vanished through 
the entrance while Brennan was 
still tumbling helplessly in air. 

The air was the same as in 
the cabin, except that the pecu- 
liar scent was much stronger. 
Brennan drew it in in great rar- 
ified gasps. 

The lighting was greener than 
the sunlight tubes he was used 
to. The only clear space was the 
space he floated in, no bigger

than the lifesystem of a two-man 
mining ship. On his right were 
a number of squarish crates 
whose material was almost wood, 
certainly a plant of some kind. 
To his left, a massive rectangu- 
lar solid with a lid, almost like 
a big deepfreeze. Above, a curv- 
ed wall. 

So he’d been right. This was a 
cargo hold. 

And all through the air, a 
peculiar scent, like an unfamiliar 
perfume. The smell in the life- 
system had been an animal smell, 
the smell of the Outsider. This 
was different. 

Below him, behind a net of 
coarse weave, were things that 
looked like yellow roots. If there 
were no hidden motors or other 
sections behind them, they must 
have occupied most of the cargo 
hold. Brennan jumped down at 
them, wrapped his fingers in the 
net to bring his eyes close. 

The smell became hugely more 
intense. He’d never smelled, im- 
agined, dreamed anything like it. 

Close up, they still looked like 
pale yellow roots: a cross be- 
tween a sweet potato and a peel- 
ed piece of the root of a small 
tree. They were squat and wide 
and fibrous, pointed at one end 
and knife flattened at the other. 
Brennan reached through the 
net, got a two -finger grip on one, 
tried to pull it through the net 
and couldn’t. 


He’d had breakfast just before 
the Outsider pulled alongside. 
Yet, with no warning grumblings 
in his belly, suddenly he was 
ravenously hungry. He stabbed 
his fingers through the net, 
grasped for the roots. For min- 
utes he tried to pull one through 
holes which were just too small. 
He tore at the net, raging. The 
net was stronger than human 
flesh; it would not tear, though 
fingernails did. He screamed his 
frustration, and the scream 
brought him to his senses. 

Suppose he did get one out? 
What then? 

EAT IT! cried his belly and 
viscera, commanding. His mouth 
ran saliva. 

It would kill him. An alien 
plant from an alien world, a 
plant obviously regarded a food 
by an alien species. He should 
be thinking of a way out of here! 

Yet his fingers were still tear- 
ing at the net. Brennan kicked 
himself away. He was hungry. 
The fragments of his suit were 
gone, left behind in the alien life- 
system, including the water and 
food-syrup nipples in his helmet. 
Was there water in here? Could 
he trust it? What guarantee had 
he that the Outsider had a use 
for partially burnt hydrogen? 

What would he do for food? 

He had to get out of here. 

But he couldn’t move around 
in that plastic bag; even in his 


132 


GALAXY 


own suit it would have been 
risky, jumping across eight miles 
of space without a back pac. 

He had to distract his stomach 
somehow. 

Why were the contents of this 
hold so valuable? How could 
they be more valuable than the 
pilot, who was needed to get 
them to their destination? 

Might as well see what’s here. 

r T~'he rectangular solid was a 
A glossy, temperatureless ma- 
terial. Brennan found the handle 
easily enough, but it wouldn’t 
budge under his pull. Then the 
enticing smell of the roots made 
a concerted attack on his hunger, 
and he yelled and pulled with 
all the strength of killing rage. 
The handle jarred open. 

It was filled with seeds, large 
seeds like almonds, frozen in a 
matrix of frost, bitterly cold. He 
wrenched one loose with numb- 
ing fingers. The air about him 
was turning the color of cigarette 
smoke when he closed the lid. 

He put the seed in his mouth, 
warmed it with saliva. It had no 
taste; it was merely cold, and 
then not even that. He spit it out. 

So. Green light and strange, 
rich-smelling air. But not too 
thin, not too strange; and the 
light was cool and refreshing. 

If Brennan liked the Outsider’s 
lifesystem, the Outsider would 
like Earth. 


He’d brought a crop to plant, 
too. Seeds, roots, and . and 
what? 

Brennan kicked across the 
clear space to the stack of crates. 
Not all the strength of his back 
and legs would tear a crate loose 
from the wall. Contact cement? 
But a lid came up with great re- 
luctance and a creaking noise. 
Sure enough, it had been glued 
down; the wood itself had torn 
away. Brennan wondered what 
strange plant had produced it. 

Inside was a sealed plastic 
bag. Plastic? It looked and felt 
like a strong commercial sand- 
wich wrap. What was inside felt 
like fine dust packed nearly 
solid. It was dark through the 
plastic. 

Brennan floated near the 
crates, one hand gripping the 
torn lid, wondering . 

An autopilot, of course. The 
Outsider was only a backup for 
the autopilot; it didn’t matter 
what happened to him, he was 
only a safety device. The auto- 
pilot would get this crop to wher- 
ever it was going. 

To Earth. But a crop meant 
other Outsiders, following. 

He had to warn Earth. 

How? 

^Brennan laughed at himself. 
Was ever a man so completely 
trapped? The Outsider had him. 
Brennan, a Belter and a free 
man, had allowed himself to be- 


THE ADULTS 


133 


come property. His laughter 
died into despair. 

Despair was a mistake. The 
smell had been waiting to pounce. 

... It was the pain that 
brought him out of it. His hands 
were bleeding from cuts and 
abrasions. There were sprains 
and blisters and bruises. His left 
finger screamed its agony at him; 
it stuck out at a strange angle, 
and it swelled as he watched. 
Dislocated or broken. But he’d 
tom a hole in the net, and his 
right hand gripped a fibrous root. 

He threw it as hard as he could 
and instantly curled in upon 
himself, hugging his knees as if 
to surround his pain and smother 
it. He was angry and scared. 
Why, that damnable smell had 
turned off his mind as if he were 
no more than a child’s toy robot! 
Worse, his body had ignored his 
wishes as thoroughly as had the 
Outsider. 

He floated through the cargo 
space like a football, hugging his 
knees and crying. He was hungry 
and angry and humiliated, but 
most of all he was scared. The 
Outsider had seared his mind 
with his own unimportance. He 
had slapped his fists against the 
Outsider’s blank, hard face, but 
the Outsider had ignored him, 
holding him out for inspection 
like a judge in the Toy group 
at a dog show. When Brennan 
kicked him where his groin 


should have been, the alien had 
noticed and looked down, watch- 
ed as Brennan kicked again, re- 
turned to his inspection . 

But why? What did the Out- 
sider want with him? 

Something smacked him across 
the back of his head. In one fluid 
motion Brennan snatched the 
missile out of the air and bit 
into it. The root had returned 
to him on a ricochet orbit. Its 
taste was as indescribable and 
as delicious as its scent. 

In a last lucid moment Bren- 
nan wondered how long he 
would need to die. He didn’t 
much care. He bit again, and 
swallowed. 

V 

T here were few big cargo ships 
in the Belt. Most miners 
preferred to haul their own car- 
go. The ships which hauled the 
large cargos from asteroid to as- 
teroid were not large; they were 
simply furnished with a great 
many attachments. To haul a 
large cargo, the crew strung it 
out on the attachments, in nets 
or on lightweight shelves, spray- 
ed foam plastic to protect what- 
ever they were hauling, covered 
the bottom of the nets or shelves 
with special reflective foil to 
ward off the searing light of the 
drive, and took off at low power. 
The Blue Ox was a special 


134 


GALAXY 


case. She hauled fluids and fine 
dusts: refined quicksilver and 
mined water, grain, seeds, highly 
impure tin scooped molten from 
lakes on dayside Mercury, mixed 
and dangerous chemicals from 
Jupiter’s atmosphere. Such car- 
gos were not always available 
for hauling. So the Ox was a 
huge tank with a small threeman 
lifesystem and an adequate pro- 
pulsion system; but, since she 
must sometimes carry bulky ob- 
jects instead of seeds or fluids, 
her big tank had been designed 
with a big lid. 

Einar Nilsson stood at the rim 
of that lid, looking in. He was 
seven feet tall and overweight 
for a Belter, and that was over- 
weight for anyone, for the fat 
had gone into his belly and sec- 
ond chin. The device on his suit 
was a Viking ship with snarling 
dragon prow, floating not in 
space but in the bright, milky 
swirl of a spiral galaxy. 

The singleship in the Ox’s tank 
was Nilsson’s own. There was a 
new Adzhubei 4-4 computer; 
there were machines intended to 
serve as the computer’s senses 
and speakers, radar and radio 
and sonics and monochromatic 
lights. Each item was tethered 
separately, half a dozen ways, to 
hooks on the inside wall of the 
tank. 

Nilsson nodded, satisfied, his 
graying red Belter crest brush- 


ing the crown of his helmet. 
“Fire,” he said. 

Tim Truesdale began spraying 
fluid into the tank. In thirty 
seconds the tank was filled with 
foam which was already harden- 
ing. 

“Close the lid.” 

It was done. 

“Get aboard, Tim. Nate, how 
much time we got?” 

“Another twenty minutes to 
catch the optimum course,” said 
the young voice. 

“Okay, call Ceres. Ask for per- 
mission to take off. We’ll have 
to take off before it comes, but 
we might as well ask.” 

“Sold,” said the young voice, 
and clicked off. Nathan was 
young, but not young enough to 
waste words over a phone. He 
learned fast. Einar had taken 
him on at the request of his 
father, an old friend. 

He’d taken Tim because Tim 
could obey orders. Perhaps too 
much so. Tim had been a flat- 
lander until he was twenty, and 
flatlanders were not high on orig- 
inality. But Tim had sense, and 
he’d lived in the Belt for eight 
years. 

Einar finished sealing the lid 
over the hardened foam plastic, 
then jumped for the airlock, fol- 
lowing Tim. They were going to 
meet the first alien to reach the 
solar system in human history; 
but it never occurred to him to

doubt the competency of either 
of his men. They were Belters. 
And they would be cautious. 

UXTick?” 

“Here.” Nick picked up 
his tea bottle, found it empty. 
There was a plate beside it, also 
empty. 

“The Blue Ox wants to take 
off.” 

“Send ’em permission.” 

“Okay. But I notice they 
aren’t armed.” 

“They’ve got a fusion drive, 
don’t they? And oversized steer- 
ing jets to aim it. The drive is 
all the weapon they’ll need.” 

Cutter clicked off. 

Nick stared at the screen for 
a moment, with his eyes squinch- 
ed shut so the strain lines show- 
ed like webs around the eyelids. 
Was he right? He was ninety 
percent sure he was. Even an 
H-bomb would be less effective 
as a weapon than the directed 
hydrogen explosion from a fusion 
drive. And an H-bomb was an 
obvious weapon, an insult and 
a challenge to a peace-loving 
Outsider. 

Four blobs showed on the 
screen. Without the fusion drives 
they were dark-on-dark, hard to 
see, but Nick could see that the 
Outsider ship was strung out in- 
to three parts. A poor way to 
build a ship, unless your shield- 
ing was very bad. That middle 


section, well, it might contain 
anything, including a reserve 
fuel supply; but principly it 
must be a shield for the lifesys- 
tem. The blobs hadn’t changed 
motion for hours. 

The waiting was a strain. 

Nick went back to Brennan’s 
dossier. It was thin. They were 
all thin. Belters wouldn’t have 
accepted a government which 
kept more than minimal tabs on 
them. 

John Fitzgerald Brennan was 
very much the average Belter. 
Forty-five years of age. Two 
daughters by the same woman, 
Charlotte Leigh Wiggs, a pro- 
fessional farming machine repair- 
woman in Confinement. Brennan 
had the beginnings of a nice re- 
tirement fund, though it had 
been drained twice to establish 
trust fund for his children. He 
had twice lost loads of radio- 
active ore to the goldskins and 
the Belt smuggling laws. Once 
would have been typical. Belters 
laugh at inept smugglers, but a 
man who’s never been caught 
may be suspected of never hav- 
ing tried. No guts. 

His suit design proclaimed 
him a Dali fan. Nick frowned. 
Miners sometimes lost their grip 
on reality, out there. But Bren- 
nan was alive, and fairly well 
off on his own earnings. 

Twenty years ago he’d worked 
with a crew, mining molten tin 


136 


GALAXY 


on Mercury’s dayside. Because 
of the Sun’s magnetic field, Mer- 
cury was rich with valuable non- 
ferrous elements. The tin was 
easier to get at when molten. 
Brennan had been competent, 
and he’d made good money, but 
he’d quit after ten months and 
never worked with a crew again. 
Apparently he didn’t like work- 
ing with others. 

Why had: he let the Outsider 
catch him? 

Silly question. Nick would 
have done the same. The Out- 
sider was here in the system; 
somebody had to meet him. Run- 
ning would have been an admis- 
sion that Brennan couldn’t han- 
dle such a meeting. No miner 
would make that admission. 

His family wouldn’t have stop- 
ped him. His family were Belt- 
ers; they could take care of 
themselves. 

But I wish he’d run, thought 
Nick. His fingers beat a rhyth- 
mic tattoo on the desk. He’d 
have been a smoker, if Belters 
smoked. 

L eaving his captive in the car- 
go hold, Phssthpok moved 
across to the native’s ship. It 
was an hour’s jump, but Phssth- 
pok was not hurried. With his 
superb reflexes he didn’t even 
need the reaction pistol. 

His captive would keep. Even- 
tually he would have to learn 


the alien’s language, to question 
him about the ones Phssthpok 
had come to help. By now 
Phssthpok was sure he’d picked 
the wrong star. There had only 
been twenty-eight percent chance 
to start with. But with ships like 
this the natives might have 
reached other stars. 

The ship was small. Phssthpok 
found little more than a small 
life-support system, a long drive 
tube, a ring-shaped hydrogen 
tank with a cooling motor and 
an attached something-or-other 
whose purpose was not obvious. 
The fusion tube extended far be- 
yond the fuel ring, which was 
under the lifesystem. The fuel 
ring was so attached that it could 
be slipped off the drive tube and 
replaced by a full tank in a few 
minutes. Around the rim of the 
life-support system were a set 
of attachments, including several 
folded fine-mesh nets. 

Some of the attachments — 
hooks — now secured a light- 
weight metal cylinder which 
showed signs of erosion. Phssth- 
pok looked it over, dismissed it 
without knowing its purpose. Ob- 
viously it was not needed for the 
ship to function. It was some 
kind of cargo. 

Phssthpok found inspection 
panels in. the fusion tube and 
used them. Within half an hour 
he could build his own fusion 
shield, had he the materials,

137 


though he still didn’t understand 
what made it go. The natives 
must be more intelligent than 
he had guessed. Or luckier. He 
moved up to the lifesystem and 
through the oval door. 

The cabin included an acceler- 
ation couch, banks of controls 
surrounding it in a horseshoe, a 
space behind the couch big 
enough to move around in, an 
automatic kitchen, and attach- 
ments to several mechanical 
senses of types frequently used 
in Pak warfare. But this was not 
a warship. Perhaps the native’s 
sense’s were less acute than Pak 
senses. Behind the cabin were 
machinery and tanks of fluid, 
which Phssthpok examined with 
great interest. 

Assume that these machines 
are well designed, he told him- 
self. Then GO Target #1-3 is 
habitable. Very. A trifle heavy, 
both in air and in gravity. But 
to a people who had been travel- 
ing for five hundred thousand 
years, it would have looked ir- 
resistible. 

Had they reached here, they 
would have gone no further. 

And that cut Phssthpok’s re- 
gion of search in half. He need 
not look at stars further from 
the galactic core than this one. 

'T’he lifesystem was the most 
puzzling part of the ship. 
Phssthpok found things he flatly 


didn’t understand, that he would 
never understand. 

The kitchen, for instance. 
Weight was important in space. 
Surely the natives could have 
provided a lightweight food, syn- 
thetic if necessary, capable of 
keeping the pilot fed and 
healthy indefinitely. The saving 
in effort and in fuel consumption 
would have been enormous when 
multiplied by the number of 
ships he’d seen. Instead, they 
preferred to carry a tremendous 
variety of prepackaged foods and 
a complex machine to select and 
heat them. They had chosen to 
cool these foods against decom- 
position rather than reduce them 
to a powder. Why? 

Pictures, for instance. Phssth- 
pok understood photographs, and 
he understood graphs. But the 
three works of art on the back 
wall were neither. They were 
charcoal sketches. One was of 
the head of a native like Phssth- 
pok’s captive, but with a longer 
crest of hair and with weird pig- 
mentation around eyes and 
mouth; the others must have 
been younger editions of the 
same species. Only heads and 
shoulders were shown. What was 
their purpose? 

Under other circumstances the 
design on Brennan’s spacesuit 
might have provided a clue. 

Phssthpok had noticed that 
design and understood instantly. 


138 


GALAXY 


For members of a cooperative, 
space-going species, it would be 
useful to code one’s suit in bright 
colors. Others would recognize 
the code at great distances. The 
native’s design seemed overcom- 
plex, but not enough so to rouse 
Phssthpok’s curiosity. 

For Fhssthpok could never un- 
derstand the human concepts of- 
art and luxury. Luxury? A Pak 
breeder might have appreciated 
luxury, but was too stupid to 
make it for himself. A protector 
had no motivation. A protector’s 
desires were all connected to the 
need to protect his blood line. 
As for art, there had been maps 
and drawings among the Pak 
since before Pak history. But 
they were for war. 

You didn’t recognize your 
loved ones by sight anyway. 
They smelled right. 

Reproduce the smell of a lov- 
ed one? Phssthpok might have 
been led to think of that, had 
the painting on Brennan’s back 
been anything else. It would 
have been a brilliant idea! A 
method of keeping a protector 
alive and functioning long after 
his line was dead. If only Phssth- 
pok had been led to understand 
representational art . 

But what could he make of 
Brennan’s suit? 

Its chest was a copy in flour- 
escent dye of Salvidor Dali’s 
“Madonna of Port LHgat”. There 


were mountains floating above 
a soft blue sea; there were ob- 
jects which refused to touch each 
other; there was a supernally 
beautiful woman and child, with 
windows in them. There was 
nothing for Phssthpok. 

O ne thing he understood very 
quickly. 

It was the solar storm warn- 
ing in the instrument panel. 
When Phssthpok opened it and 
ascertained its purpose, he found 
it surprisingly small. Curious, 
he investigated further. The 
thing was made with magnetic 
monopoles. 

In one kangaroo leap Phssth- 
pok was crossing interplanetary 
space. He fired half the gas 
charge in his pistol, then com- 
posed himself to wait out the 
fifteen minutes of fall. 

He’d jumped toward the car- 
go section. It would be necessary 
to tie the native down against 
acceleration. Already a cursory 
inspection of the native’s ship 
had cut his search area in half. 
The native itself might carry 
knowledge even more valuable. 
Even so, Phssthpok bitterly re- 
gretted the need to protect the 
native; for the time involved 
might mean life or death. 

The natives used monopoles. 
The natives must have a means 
of detecting them. Phssthpok had 
captured a native — a hostile 


THE ADULTS 


139 


act. And Phssthpok’s ramscoop- 
drive section held a bigger mass 
of south poles than this solar 
system! 

Probably they were after him 
now. 

They couldn’t catch him in 
any reasonable time. Their 
drives would be a touch more 
powerful, since their gravity was 
about 1.09. But they wouldn’t 
have ramscoops. Before their 
bigger drives could make a dif- 
ference they’d be out of fuel. 

Provided he started in time. 

He braked to meet the cargo 
section, used his softener and 
ducked through the twing hull. 
He reached for a handhold with- 
out looking, knowing where it 
would be, his eyes searching for 
the native. 

He missed the handhold. He 
floated across the empty space 
while his muscles turned to jelly 
and melted. 

The native had broken through 
the net and was burrowing 
among the roots. His belly had 
become a hard, distended bulge. 
There was no sentience in his 
eyes. 

And all the rules were changed. 

r T''he robot was a four-foot, up- 
right cylinder floating pla- 
cidly in one corner of the Struld- 
brugs’ Club reading room. Its 
muted two-tone brown blended 
with the walls, making it almost 


invisible. Externally the robot 
was motionless. In its flared base 
fans whirred silently, holding it 
two inches off the floor, and in- 
side the featureless dome that 
was its head, scanners revolved 
endlessly, watching every comer 
of the room. 

Without taking his eyes off the 
reading screen, Lucas Garner 
reached for his glass. He found 
it with careful fingertips, picked 
it up and tried to drink. It was 
empty. He held it aloft, wiggled 
it and, still without looking up, 
said, “Irish coffee.” 

The robot was at his elbow. 
It made no move to take the 
double-walled glass. Instead, it 
chimed softly. Garner looked up 
at last, scowling. A line of lighted 
print flowed across the robot’s 
chest 

“Terribly sorry, Mr. Gamer. 
You have exceeded your maxi- 
mum daily alcohol content.” 
“Cancel, then,” said Luke. “Go 
on, beat it.” 

The robot scooted for its cor- 
ner. Luke sighed — it was partly 
his own fault — and went back to 
reading. The tape was a new 
medical tome on “The Aging 
Process in Man.” 

Last year he had voted with 
the rest to let the Club autodoc 
monitor the Club serving robots. 
He couldn’t regret it. Not a single 
Struldbrug was less than one 
hundred and fifty-four years of 


140 


GALAXY 


age, by Club law, and the age 
requirement went up one year 
for every two that passed. They 
needed the best and most rigid 
of medical protection. 

Luke was a prime example. 
He was approaching, with little 
enthusiasm, his one hundred and 
eighty-fifth birthday. He had 
used a travel chair constantly 
for twenty years. Luke was a 
paraplegic, not because of any 
accident to his spine, but because 
his spinal nerves were dying of 
old age. Central nervous tissue 
never replaces itself, never. The 
disproportion between his thin 
unused legs and his massive 
shoulders and arms and huge 
hands made him look a little 
apelike. Luke was aware of this 
and rather enjoyed it. 

His attention was wholly on 
the tape he was speedreading 
when he was disturbed again. A 
barely audible murmur of voices 
filled the reading room with a 
formless, swelling whisper. Re- 
gretfully Luke turned to look. 

Someone was walking in his 
direction, using a purposeful 
stride which could not have been 
matched by any Struldbrug. The 
man had the long, narrow frame 
of one who has spent some years 
on a stretch rack. His arms and 
the skin below his larynx were 
negro dark; but his hands and 
his heavily lined face were the 
black of a starless night, a true 


space black. His hair was a cock- 
atoo’s crest, an inch-wide strip 
of snow-white rug from the 
crown of his head to the nape 
of his neck. 

A Belter had invaded the 
Struldbrugs’ Club. No wonder 
they whispered! 

He stopped before Luke’s 
chair. “Lucas Garner?” His voice 
and manner were grave and for- 
mal. 

“Right,” said Luke. 

The man lowered his voice. 
“I’m Nickolas Sohl, First Speak- 
er for the Belt Political Section. 
Is there someplace we can talk?” 

“Follow me,” said Luke. He 
touched controls in the arm of 
his chair, and the chair rose on 
a ground-effect air cushion and 
moved across the room. 

66'\7 r ou really caused an uproar 
JL in there.” 

“Oh? Why?” The First Speak- 
er sprawled limp and boneless in 
a masseur chair, letting the tiny 
motors knead him into new 
shapes. His voice was still quick 
and crisp with the well known 
Belter accent. 

Luke couldn’t decide whether 
he was joking. “Why? For one 
thing, you’re nowhere near ad- 
mission age.” 

“The guard didn’t say any- 
thing. He just sort of stared with 
his jaw hanging.” 

“I can imagine.”

“You know why I’m on 
Earth?” 

“I heard. There’s an alien in 
the system.” 

“It was supposed to be secret.” 
“I used to be an ARM — a 
member of the UN Technolog- 
ical Police. They didn’t retire 
me until two years ago. I’ve still 
got contacts.” 

“That’s what I heard.” Nick 
opened his eyes. “Excuse me if 
I’m being rude. I can stand your 
silly gravity lying in a ship’s 
couch, but I don’t like walking 
through it.” 

“Relax then.” 

“Thanks. Garner, nobody at 
the UN seems to realize how 
urgent this is. There’s an alien 
in the system. He’s performed 
a hostile act, kidnapped a Belter. 
He’s abandoned his interstellar 
drive, and we can both guess 
what that means.” 

“He intends to stay. Tell me 
about that, will you?” 

“Simple enough. You know 
the Outsider ship came in three 
easy-to-assemble parts?” 

“I found out that much.” 

“The trailing section must 
have been a re-entry capsule. We 
should have guessed tfaere’d be 
one. About two and a half hours 
after Brennan made contact with 
the Outsider, that section sud- 
denly disappeared.” 

“Teleport?” 

“No, we’ve got one film panel 


that shows a blurred streak. The 
acceleration was huge.” 

“I see. Why come to us?” 
“Huh? Gamer, this is humani- 
ty’s business.” 

“Let’s not play games, Nick. 
The Outsider was humanity’s 
business the second you spotted 
him. You didn’t come to us until 
he pulled his disappearing act. 
Why not? Because you thought 
the aliens would have a better 
opinion if they met Belters first?” 
“No comment.” 

“Okay. Why tell us now? If 
the Belt scopes can’t find him, 
nobody can.” 

Nick turned off his massage 
chair and sat up to study the 
old man. Garner’s face was the 
face of Time, a loose mask that 
seemed to cover ancient evil. 
Only the eyes and teeth seemed 
young; and teeth were new, 
white and sharp and incongru- 
ous. 

But the old man talked like a 
Belter. He talked in straight 
lines; he didn’t waste words, and 
he didn’t play games. He was 
the sharpest flatlander Nick had 
met yet. 

“Right,” said Nick. “That’s 
the trouble. We’ve found him.” 

VI 

11 the rules were changed. 
Phssthpok grabbed for a 
handhold and pushed down to 



142 


GALAXY 


Brennan. Brennan was limp now, 
his eyes half closed with the 
whites drawing under the lids, 
his hand still clutching half of a 
root. Phssthpok set him rotating 
to make an examination. 

All right. 

Phssthpok climbed through 
the hull and made his way back 
to the large end of the egg. There 
he crawled back inside, emerging 
in a cubicle just big enough to 
hold him. 

He needed a place to hide. 

If he must stay in this system, 
he would have to abandon the 
rest of the ship. It would be like 
hiding all his children in the 
same cave, but there was no help 
for that. , 

It could have been worse. 
Though the instruments in the 
cargo hold were designed only 
to drop that section from orbit 
around some planet, the gravity 
polarizer would take him any- 
where he wanted to go within 
GO Target #l’s gravity well. Ex- 
cept that he would have to do 
everything right the first time. 
Except that he could only land 
once. As a ship’s drive, the gravi- 
ty polarizer had many of the vir- 
tues and faults of a paraglider. 
He could aim it anywhere he 
wanted to go, even after he’d 
killed his velocity . provided 
that he wanted to go down. The 
polarizer would not lift him 
against gravity. 


Compared to the fusion drive 
controls, the controls around him 
were fiercely complicated. 
Phssthpok began twisting dials 
and pushing buttons. The “plas- 
tic” line at the big end of the 
egg separated in a puff of flame. 
The twing around him became 
transparent . and slightly por- 
ous; in a century it would have 
lost a dangerous amount of air. 
Phssthpok’s manlike eyes took 
on a glassy look. The next moves 
would take intense concentration. 
He hadn’t dared tie the native 
down or otherwise restrict him. 
To avoid crushing him, he would 
have to keep the internal and 
external gravities exactly bal- 
anced. The hull, which was the 
working part of the polarizer, 
might heat too much and melt 
at these velocities. Phssthpok’s 
velocity indicator was good only 
for gross measurements. 

In what was now the rear 
screen, Phssthpok could see the 
rest of his ship. He twisted two 
dials the barest fraction, and it 
vanished. 

Where to now? 

He’d need weeks to hide. He 
couldn’t hope to hide on GO 
Target #1 - 3, considering their 
technology. 

But he could only land once. 
Where he came down, he’d have 
to stay. And space was too open 
to hide in. 

Phssthpok began to search the 

143 


THE ADULTS 


sky for planets. His eyes were 
good, and planets were big and 
dim, easy to spot. Thai one was 
GO Target #1 - 3. That one was 
a gas giant, with a ring. Hide in 
the rings? But that too was a 
one-way trip with the gravity 
polarizer. 

That one. He’d studied it 
closely when he had a telescope. 
That was his hiding place. 

Phssthpok gave vent to an E- 
flat whistle. He had no choice; 
he had had no real choice in 
quite some time. That planet 
was his target. When the time 
came to leave he’d have to hope 
the native could signal his kind. 

< * < *'\7’ ou ’ve found him?” 

* “Sort of. He went through 
a smuggler trap near the end of 
his trip. We were looking for a 
bird who has the habit of coast- 
ing through populated regions 
with his drive off. The details 
aren’t important. A heat sensor 
found the Outsider, and a cam- 
era caught a section of his course 
and stayed on him long enough 
to give us velocity, position, ac- 
celeration. Acceleration was 
huge, tens of gees. It’s near cer- 
tain he was on his way to Mars.” 

“Mars?” 

“Mars, or a Mars orbit, or the 
moons. If it was an orbit we’d 
have found him by now. Ditto 
for the moons; they both have 
scope stations.” 


Luke began to laugh. Nick 
closed his eyes with a pained ex- 
pression. As the laughter began 
to rise, he sat up and stared in 
amazement. 

Luke’s laughter held more 
concentrated evil than Nick 
would have imagined possible. 
Hardened criminals had gone 
straight after hearing Lucas Gar- 
ner laugh. 

M ars was the junkheap of the 
system. In truth there were 
few useful planets in the solar 
system; Earth and Mercury’s 
dawn belt and Jupiter’s atmo- 
sphere just filled the list. But 
Mars had proved the bitterest 
disappointment. A nearly airless 
desert, covered with craters and 
with seas of ultrafine dust, the 
atmosphere poisoned by nitric 
oxide. Somewhere near the pole 
was an abandoned base, very 
old, the remains of Man’s third 
and last trip to the rusty planet. 
Nobody wanted Mars. 

When the Free Belt Charter 
was signed, after the Belt had 
proven by embargo that Earth 
needed the Belt more than the 
Belt needed Earth, the UN had 
been allowed to keep Earth, the 
Moon, Titan, rights in Saturn’s 
rings, mining and exploratory 
rights on Mercury, and Mars. 

Mars was just a token. Mars 
hadn’t counted until now. 

“You see the problem,” said 


144 


GALAXY 


Nick. He’d turned the massage 
unit on again. Little muscles all 
over his body were giving up 
under Earth’s unaccustomed 
strain, stridently proclaiming 
their existence for the first time 
in Nick’s life. 

“Sure. Considering the way the 
Belt is constantly telling us to 
stay off their property, you can’t 
blame the UN for trying to get 
a little of their own back. We 
must have a couple of hundred 
complaints on file.” 

“You exaggerate. Since the 
Free Belt Charter was signed, 
we’ve registered some sixty vio- 
lations, most of which were al- 
lowed and paid for by the UN.” 
“What is it you want the UN 
to do that they aren’t doing?” 
“We want access to Earth’s 
records on the study of Mars. 
The Belt has never been inter- 
ested in Mars. We want permis- 
sion to search the deserts for the 
Outsider. We want permission to 
land.” 

“How far have you gotten?” 
“There are only two things 
they can agree on. We can 
search all we want to — from 
space. For letting us look at their 
silly records they want to charge 
us a flat million marks!” 

“Pay it.” 

“It’s robbery!” 

“A Belter says that? Why 
don’t you have records on 
Mars?” 


“I told you, we were never in- 
terested. What for? Mars is a 
useless planet.” 

“How about abstract knowl- 
edge?” 

“Another word for useless.” 

“Then why aren’t you about 
to pay a million marks for use- 
less knowledge?” 

Slowly Nick matched his grin. 
“Just stupid, I guess. How the 
blazes did Earth know they’d 
need to know about Mars?” 

“They didn’t. That’s the secret 
of abstract knowledge. You get 
in the habit of finding out every- 
thing you can about everything. 
Most of it gets used sooner or 
later.” 

“I’ll authorize payment of a 
million marks to the UN Grand 
Library. Now how do we land?” 
Nick turned off the massage 
chair. 

“You picked the right word. 
We. Can you fly a two man 
ship?” 

“Blindfolded.” 

“You’ve flipped.” 

“Blindfolded.” 

“You’re hired as my pilot at 
a dollar a year. I can get a ship 
ready in six hours.” 

Ci'V Tot I. Look, Nick. Every 
so-called diplomat in the 
UN knows how important it is 
to find the Outsider. But they 
can’t get moving. It’s not be- 
cause they’re getting their own 


THE ADULTS

back with the Belt. That’s only 
part of it. What counts is that 
the UN is a world government. 
It’s unwieldly by its very nature, 
having to rule the lives of eight- 
een billion people. Worse than 
that, the UN is made up of in- 
dividual nations. The nations 
aren’t powerful nowadays. Some- 
day not too soon, even their 
names will be forgotten. But to- 
day national prestige can get in 
the way of the total good. You’ll 
be weeks getting them to agree. 

“Whereas there’s no law 
against a UN citizen going any- 
where he wants to, or hiring any- 
one he wants to. A number of 
our round-the-Moon pilots are 
Belters.” 

Nick shook his head as if to 
clear it. “Garner, I don’t get it. 
You can’t think we can find the 
Outsider in a two-man ship. 
Even I know about Martian 
dust. He’s hidden under there, 
and there’s no way to get at him 
without a complete radar net.” 

“Right. But when the UN rea- 
lizes that you’ve started search- 
ing Mars, what do you think 
they’ll do? You being hired as 
a pilot is a technicality, obvious 
to anyone. Suppose we find the 
Outsider? The Belt would get the 
credit.” 

Nick closed his eyes and tried 
to think. He wasn’t used to such 
circular logic. But it looked like 
Garner was right. If they thought 


he was going to Mars, with or 
without a flatlander for com- 
pany, they’d send a fleet to start 
searching first. 

“So I need a flatlander to hire 
me as a pilot. Fine. But why 
you?” 

“Because I can get a ship. I’ve 
got contacts.” 

“You’ve got to be nuts. How 
old are you?” 

“Too old to waste my few re- 
maining years in the Struldbrugs’ 
Club. Too young to be retired. 
Shake hands, Nick.” 

“Mph? Sure, but — Yipe! All 
right, damnit, so you’ve got 
strong hands.” 

“And we won’t be using our 
legs. We’ll be riding everywhere 
we go. You can’t walk anywhere 
on Mars.” 

“Luke, I think I’ve got it. You 
can get a ship, right? Right. So 
get a ship, then get a tough ex- 
plorer-type flatlander. Sell him 
the ship. Then he hires me as his 
pilot, right?” 

“Right. But I won’t do it.” 

“Blackmail?” 

“Blackmail.” 

“You’re all crazy. All of you. 
It comes from living at the bot- 
tom of a gravity well. The grav- 
ity pulls the blood away from 
your brains.” 

“I’ll show you to a telephone. 
You’ll have to pay in your mil- 
lion marks before the UN 
catches on where we’re going.”

hssthpok dreamed. 

He stayed in the cargo hold 
where he could watch the native. 
There was food and water and 
no need to go outside. During 
the first week he had disassem- 
bled every machine in the cargo 
hold to make what repairs and 
adjustments were needed. Now 
he only watched his captive. The 
native required little care. 

Phssthpok rested on his stock- 
pile of roots and dreamed. 

In a few weeks he would have 
completed his long, long task . 
or failed. In any case he would 
stop eating. He had been alive 
long enough to suit him. Soon 
he would end as he had nearly 
ended thirteen hundred shiptime 
years ago . 

It had been a matter of time. 

Phssthpok had been a protec- 
tor for sixteen years. His remain- 
ing children in the radiation- 
blasted Valley of Pitchok were 
sixteen to thirty-five years of 
age; his living grandchildren were 
of all ages up to twenty-four or 
so. But who had survived the 
bomb? He had returned immedi- 
ately to the Valley of Pitchok 
to find out. 

Not many breeders were left 
in the valley, but such as were 
still alive had to be protected. 
Phssthpok and the rest of the 
Pitchok families made peace, the 
terms being that they and their 
sterile children should have the 


valley until their deaths, at 
which time the valley would re- 
vert to Eastersea Alliance. There 
were ways to neutralize radio- 
active fallout. The Pitchok fam- 
ilies used them. Then, leaving 
their valley and its survivors in 
the hands of one of their number, 
they had scattered. 

Of the several hundred survi- 
vors, all had been tested and all 
had been found essentially ster- 
ile. “Essentially” being taken to 
mean that if they did have chil- 
dren, the children would be mu- 
tants. Their smells would be al- 
tered. With no protector to look 
after their interests, they would 
quickly die. 

To Phssthpok, the most impor- 
tant of his surviving descendants 
was the youngest, Ttuss. a fe- 
male of two years. 

It had been a matter of time. 
In thirty-two years Ttuss would 
reach the age of change. She 
would become an intelligent be- 
ing and a heavily armored one, 
with skin that would turn a cop- 
per knife and strength to lift ten 
times her own weight. She would 
be ideally designed for the pur- 
pose of fighting, but she would 
have nothing to fight for. 

She would stop eating. She 
would die, and Phssthpok would 
stop eating. Ttuss’s lifespan was 
his own. 

But sometimes a protector 
could adopt the entire Pak spe- 


THE ADULTS 


147 


cies as his descendants. At least 
he’d have every opportunity to 
find a purpose in life. There was 
always truce for a childless pro- 
tector, for such never had a rea- 
son to fight. And there was a 
place he could go. 

T he library was as old as the 
radioactive desert which sur- 
rounded it. That desert would 
never be recultivated; it was re- 
seeded every thousand years 
with radiocobalt so that no pro- 
tector could covet it. Protectors 
could cross that desert; they had 
no gonadal genes to be smashed 
by subatomic particles. Repro- 
ducers could not. 

Hew old was the desert? 
Phssthpok never knew and never 
wondered. But the section on 
space travel was a million years 
old. 

He came to the Library with 
a number of — not friends, but 
associates in misery, childless 
former members of the Pitchok 
families. The Library was huge 
and rambling, a composite of at 
least a million years of Pak 
knowledge, crossfiled into vari- 
ous sections according to subject. 
Naturally several sections often 
contained the same book. The 
associates divided at the en- 
trance, and Phssthpok didn’t see 
any of them again for thirty-two 
years. 

He spent those thirty-two 


years in one vast room, a floor- 
to-ceiling labyrinth of book- 
shelves. At scattered corners 
there were bins of tree-of-life 
root kept constantly filled by at- 
tendants. There were other food- 
stuffs brought at seeming ran- 
dom: meats, vegetables, fruits, 
whatever was available to child- 
less protectors who had chosen to 
serve the Library rather than 
die. Tree-of-life root was the 
perfect food for a protector, but 
he could eat nearly anything. 

And there were books. 

They were nearly indestruc- 
tible, those books. They would 
have emerged like fluttering me- 
teors from the heart of a hydro- 
gen bomb explosion. All were 
written more or less in the pres- 
ent language, and all were con- 
stantly being recopied by librar- 
ians as the language changed. In 
this room the books all dealt with 
space and space travel. 

There were treatises on the 
philosophy of space travel. They 
all seemed to make a fundamen- 
tal assumption : someday the Pak 
race must find a new home; 
hence every contribution to the 
techniques of interstellar flight 
was a contribution to the immor- 
tality of the Pak species. Phssth- 
pok could discount that assump- 
tion, knowing that a protector 
who did not believe it would 
never write a book on the sub- 
ject. There were records of inter- 


148 


GALAXY 



THE ADULTS 


149 


stellar and interplanetary flights, 
hundreds of thousands of them, 
starting with a fantastic trip 
some group made almost a mil- 
lion years ago, riding a hollowed- 
out asteroidal rock into the arms 
of the galaxy in search of yellow 
dwarf suns. There were technical 
texts on everything that could 
possibly relate to space or space- 
craft or astrogation: miniaturiza- 
tion, nuclear and subnuclear 
physics, plastics, ecology, gravi- 
ty and how to use it, relativity, 
astronomy, astrophysics, records 
of extraplanetary mining, dia- 
grams for a hypothetical ram- 
scoop (in an unfinished work by 
a protector who had lost his ap- 
petite halfway through), ion 
drive diagrams, plasma theory. 

H e started at the left and be- 
gan working his way around. 
He’d chosen the section on 
space travel more or less at ran- 
dom; it had looked less crowded 
than the others. The romance of 
space was not in Phssthpok’s 
soul. He kept with it rather than 
change endeavors in midcourse, 
feeling certain that he’d need 
every minute of his thirty-four 
years of grace no matter what 
section he chose. In twenty-eight 
years he read every book in the 
Astronautics section, and he still 
had found nothing that drastic- 
ally needed doing. 

Start a migration project? It 


simply wasn’t that urgent. The 
Pak sun had at least hundreds 
of millions of years to live . 
longer than the Pak species, 
probably, considering their per- 
ennial state of war. And the 
chance of disaster would be high. 
There were no known yellow 
suns in the galactic core. For 
that and other reasons, including 
the probability that the entire 
core would someday explode in 
a chain reaction of novas, it 
would be necessary to go into 
the arms looking for habitable 
planets. 

The first expedition to try that 
had met a horrible fate. 

So. Join the Library staff? 
He’d thought of it many times, 
but the answer always came out 
the same. No matter what phase 
of the Library he concerned him- 
self with, his life would depend 
on others. To retain his will to 
live he would need to know that 
all Pak would benefit from his 
aspect of Library work. Let there 
be a dry spell in new discoveries, 
let his faith flag, and he would 
find himself no longer hungry. 

It was terrifying not to be hun- 
gry. During the last few decades 
it had happened several times. 
Each time he had forced himself 
to reread the communications 
from the Valley of Pitchok. The 
last communication always told 
him that Ttuss had been alive 
when it was sent. Gradually, time 


150 


GALAXY 


after time, his appetite had come 
back. But for Ttuss he would 
be dead. He had investigated the 
librarians and found that their 
lives were unusually short. The 
Library was no answer. 

Find a way to keep Ttuss 
alive? There was no way. If there 
were he would have used it on 
himself. 

Study theoretical astronomy? 
He had some ideas, but they 
would not help the race of Pak. 
The Pak did not seek abstract 
knowledge. Mine the asteroids? 
The asteroids were as thoroughly 
mined out as the surface of the 
planet had often been, with the 
difference that convection cur- 
rents in the planet’s interior 
eventually replaced worked-out 
mines. He should have gone in 
for metal reclamation. Now it 
was too late to change studies. 
Put plastic-bubble cities in orbit 
to provide more living room for 
breeders? Nonsense! Too vulner- 
able to capture or accidental 
destruction. 

One day Phssthpok’s appetite 
was gone. The letters from the 
Valley of Pitchok did not help; 
he did not believe them. He 
thought of returning to the val- 
ley, but he knew he’d starve to 
death on the way. When he was 
sure, he sat down against a wall, 
the last in a line of protectors 
who also did not eat, who were 
waiting to die. 


A week passed. The librarians 
found that two at the head of 
the line were dead. They picked 
them up, a pair of skeletons 
clothed in dried, wrinkled leather 
armor, and carried them away 
somewhere. 

Phssthpok remembered a book. 

He still had the strength to 
reach it. 

He read carefully, with the 
book in one hand and a root in 
the other. Presently he ate the 
root . 

T he ship had been a roughly 
cylindrical asteroid, reason- 
ably pure nickel-iron with stony 
strata running through it, about 
six miles long and four through. 
A group of childless protectors 
had carved it out with solar mir- 
rors and built into it a small 
life-support and controls system, 
a larger frozen -sleep chamber, a 
breeder atomic pile and genera- 
tor, a dirigible ion drive, and an 
enormous cesium tank. They had 
found it necessary to extermin- 
ate the protector stage members 
of a large family in order to get 
control of a thousand breeders. 
With two protectors as pilots 
and seventy more in suspended 
animation with the thousand 
breeders, with a careful selection 
of the beneficial lifeforms of the 
Pak planet, they set out into 
one arm of the galaxy. 

Though their knowledge was 


THE ADULTS 


151 


a million years scantier than 
Phssthpok’s, they had good rea- 
sons for choosing an arm. Most 
of the stars around them were 
Population II. They’d have a 
better chance of finding yellow 
suns out there, and a better 
chance of finding a double planet 
in the right place. Perturbations 
from stars an average of half a 
light-year away made double 
planets scarce in the Core; and 
there was reason to think that 
only an oversized moon could 
give any world an atmosphere 
capable of supporting Pak-style 
life. 

An ion drive and a certain 
amount of cesium . They ex- 
pected to move slowly, and they 
did. At twelve thousand miles 
per second relative to the Pak 
sun, they turned off the ion mo- 
tor. They then fired a laser mes- 
sage at the Pak system to tell 
the Library that the ion drive 
had worked. The blueprints were 
somewhere in the Library, with 
a list of suggested design changes. 

The next and last section of 
the book was nearly five hundred 
thousand years newer. It was a 
record of a laser message which 
had come plowing through the 
Pak system, torn and attenuated 
and garbled by dust and dis- 
tance, in a language no longer 
spoken. Someone had translated 
it and filed it here. Hundreds 
of searchers like Phssthpok must 


have read it and wondered about 
the part of the story they could 
never know and passed on . 

But Phssthpok read it very 
carefully. 

nphey had traveled an enorm- 
! ous distance into the galactic 
arm. Half the protectors had 
been used up when they arrived, 
dying not of starvation nor of 
violence but of age. This was 
so unusual that a detailed medi- 
cal description had been sent 
with the message. They had 
passed yellow suns with no plan- 
ets, other yellow suns whose 
worlds were all gas giants. Yel- 
low suns had gone by carrying 
potentially habitable worlds; but 
all were too far off course to be 
reached on the maneuvering re- 
serve of cesium. Galactic dust 
and the galaxy’s gravity had 
slowed their strange craft, in- 
creasing the maneuver reserve. 
The sky darkened around them 
as suns became rare. 

Presently they had found a 
planet. 

They had braked the ship, 
transferred what was left of the 
plutonium to the piles of the 
landing craft, and gone down. 
The decision was final. If the 
planet failed to measure up they 
would have to work for decades 
to make their ship spaceworthy 
again. 

It had life. Some was inimical, 


152 


GALAXY 


but none that could not be 
handled. There was soil. The re- 
maining protectors woke the 
breeders and turned them loose 
in the forests, planted their 
crops, dug mines, made machines 
to dig more mines, made ma- 
chines to tend the crops . 

The black, nearly starless 
night sky bothered some, but 
they got used to it. The frequent 
rains bothered others, but did 
not hurt the reproducers, so that 
was all right. There was room for 
all, so the protectors did not even 
fight. None stopped eating. There 
were predators and bacteria to 
exterminate, there was a civili- 
zation to build, there was too 
much to do. 

When spring came, most of 
the planted crops did not come 
up. There was no tree-of-life at 
all. 

They could not return to 
space. Cesium they could get, 
but they could never build a 
uranium-producing technology in 
the time they had left. 

Finally, knowing they were 
lost, they had tried to build a 
laser beam big enough to pierce 
the dust clouds hiding them 
from the core. They did not 
know they had succeeded. They 
did not know what had killed 
their crops; they suspected it 
might be the sparsity of a par- 
ticular kind of starlight, or star- 
light in general. They gave de- 


tailed information on the blood 
lines of their breeder cargo, hop- 
ing that some of the line might 
survive. And they asked for help. 

Five hundred thousand years 
ago. 

Phssthpok sat by the root bin, 
eating and reading. He would 
have smiled if his face had been 
built that way. Already he could 
see that his mission would in- 
volve every childless protector 
on the Pak planet. 

For five hundred thousand 
years those breeders had been 
living without tree-of-life. With- 
out any way to make the change 
to the protector stage. Dumb an- 
imals. 

And Phssthpok alone knew 
how to find them. 

N ick took the ship up on a 
ram-and-wing rented from 
Death Valley Port. It went up 
smooth all the way, no turbu- 
lence, a lovely scenic ride up and 
out over the Pacific. One hun- 
dred and fifty miles up Nick 
switched to fusion power and 
headed outward, leaving the 
ram-and-wing to find its own 
way home. 

The sky turned black, with 
bright points. The Earth wrap- 
ped itself around itself and drop- 
ped behind. It was four days to 
Mars at one gee, with Ceres to 
tell them which asteroids to 
dodge.

Nick put the ship on autopilot. 
It was a flatland navy job, un- 
familiar to him but simple 
enough for a moron to use. He 
could have flown it blindfolded. 

Luke said, “Okay to smoke?” 

“If you want lung cancer.” 

“Does the UN have its money 
yet?” 

“Sure. They must have got it 
transferred hours ago.” 

“Good. Call them, identify 
yourself and ask for everything 
they’ve got on Mars. Tell them 
to put it on the screen and you’ll 
pay for the laser. That’ll kill two 
birds with one stone.” 

“How?” 

“It’ll tell them what we’re do- 
ing.” 

“I still don’t see it. You say 
they’re so unwieldy they can’t 
move. How will our going to 
Mars make them less un- 
wieldy?” 

“Look at it from another di- 
rection, Nick. How did the Belt 
come to choose you to represent 
them?” 

“Aptitude tests said I had a 
high IQ and liked ordering peo- 
ple around. From there I worked 
my way up.” 

“Okay. We go by the vote.” 

“Popularity contests.” 

“It works. But it does have 
drawbacks. What government 
doesn’t?” Gamer shrugged. 
“Every speaker in the UN rep- 
resents some one section of the 


world. He thinks it’s the best 
section, filled with the best peo- 
ple. Otherwise he wouldn’t have 
been elected. So maybe twenty 
representatives each think they 
know just what to do about the 
Outsider, and not one of them 
will knuckle down to the others. 
Prestige. Eventually they’d work 
out a compromise between them. 
But if they get the idea that a 
civilian and a Belter could beat 
them to the Outsider, they’ll get 
off their thumbs a lot faster. 
See?” 

“No.” 

“Oh, make your call.” 

Y ou’re flying from New York, 
USA, to Piquetsburg, South 
Africa. Suddenly you become 
aware that New York is flying 
in one direction, Piquetsburg in 
another, and a hurricane wind 
is blowing your plane off course 
in still a third. All at speeds 
measured in miles per second . 

Nightmare? Well, yes. But 
traveling in the solar system is 
different from traveling on Earth. 
Each individual part moves at 
its own pace, like raisins in a 
vat of taffy being stirred by a 
witch. 

Mars moved in a nearly cir- 
cular orbit. Asteroids moved 
nearby on orbits more elliptical, 
catching up to the red planet 
or falling behind, outrunning her 
or backing toward her. Some car- 


154 


GALAXY 


ried telescopes. Their operators 
would report to Ceres if they saw 
intelligent motion on the ochre 
surface. 

The LSD4 accelerated toward 
Mars, carrying Nicholas Sohl 
and Lucas Gamer. A modulated 
laser beam followed them from 
Earth’s orbit. 

The abandoned Outsider ship 
crossed over the sun and curved 
inward, following a shallow hy- 
perbola which would take it 
through the plane of the planets. 

The Blue Ox followed an ac- 
celerating higher-order curve. 
Eventually it would match the 
Ox’s velocity and position to the 
Outsider’s. 

Eventually it did.

<e6T’m ready for a vacation,” 

J-said Nick. For the past two 
days they had been skimming 
Earth’s stored information on 
Mars. 

“That dust is our biggest prob- 
lem,” said Luke. 

“Why the Finagle did we have 
to watch all that? According to 
you, we’re just running a bluff.” 

“According to me, we’re run- 
ning a search, unless you’ve got 
something better to do. We’re 
faking a search, so why not do a 
real one? Sometimes the best 
symbol for a thing is the thing 
itself.” 


Nick turned off the laser trans- 
mitter. It was hot from two days 
of use in blasting a locator beam 
back at Earth. “I’m game, like 
I said, I’m ready for a vacation. 
Hunting strange things is what 
I do on my vacations. Did you 
say something about the dust?” 

“I said it’s our biggest prob- 
lem. The Outsider didn’t even 
have to dig a hole for itself. He 
could have sunk anywhere on 
Mars.” 

The dust of Mars was unique. 

Its uniqueness was the result 
of vacuum cementing. Once vac- 
uum cementing had been a buga- 
boo of the space industries. Small 
spaceprobe components which 
would slide easily over one an- 
other in normal air would weld 
solidly in a vacuum, just as soon 
as the gas absorbed by their sur- 
faces had evaporated away. Vac- 
uum cementing had fused parts 
in the first American satellites 
and in the first Russian inter- 
planetary probes. And vacuum 
cementing was what kept the 
Moon from being fathoms deep 
in meteor dust. The dust parti- 
cles would weld info rock, into 
natural cement, under the same 
molecular attraction that fuses 
Johanssen blocks and turns the 
mud of sea bottoms to sedimen- 
tary rock. 

But there was no vacuum ce- 
menting on Mars. There was just 
enough gas to stop that, but not 


THE ADULTS 


155 


nearly enough to stop a meteor. 
Meteor dust covered most of the 
planet. Meteors would fuse it 
into craters, but it would not 
cement, though it was fine 
enough to behave like a viscous 
oil. 

“He had some reason for land- 
ing on Mars,” said Nick. “Maybe 
it’s something he can’t do under 
the dust. In that case he must 
have landed in a crater.” 

“And been spotted.” Luke 
keyed a photograph from the au- 
topilot memory. It was one of 
a group from the smuggler trap. 
It showed a dimly shining metal 
egg with the small end pointed. 
The egg moved big-end first, 
and it moved as if rocket-pro- 
pelled. But there was no reaction 
drive, at least none that any in- 
strument could detect. 

“That thing’s big enough to see 
from space,” said Luke. “And 
easy to recognize, with that sil- 
ver hull.” 

“Right. Shall we start with the 
Lacis Solis region?” 

“Why there?” 

“It’s the deepest dust on the 
planet.” 

“He’d have been stupid to pick 
the deepest. He’d have picked 
his place at random.” 

“Then we alone don’t have a 
chance of finding him. So let’s 
assume he’s stupid.” 

Luke nodded. “We’ll need 
dustboats. The old base — ” 


“Blue Ox calling LSD 4. Blue 
Ox calling LSD4.” 

There would be a directional 
signal in that message. Nick set 
the autopilot to aiming his own 
laser back at the source. “Take 
a few minutes,” he said. 

“I was saying that we’ll have 
to land at the old base and pick 
up a boat. Can we take the deep- 
radar out of this heap?” 

“Don’t know. I’d have to ex- 
amine the ship from outside.” 

“Let’s hope we can. I don't 
know what else we can use for 
a finder.” 

“A metal detector. There must 
be one aboard.” 

There was. But again, Nick 
couldn’t tell whether it could be 
removed. There hadn’t been time 
to examine the flatland ship be- 
fore takeoff. 

“This is Nicholas Brewster 
Sohl aboard LSD4 calling any or 
all aboard the Blue Ox. What’s 
new? Repeating. This is Nicho- 
las—” 

Nate flicked to transmit. “Na- 
than La Pan aboard Bluo Ox. 
We have matched with the Out- 
sider ship. The others are pre- 
paring to board. I will switch 
you to Einar Nilsson.” He did. 

And then he settled back to 
wait. 

It was torment, having to wait 
here in the Ox’s control room 
while Tim and Einar moved in 


156 


GALAXY 


on the Outsider. Nate had pro- 
tested mightily, but Einar’s ar- 
gument had no holes to crawl 
through. 

“This Brennan,” Einar had 
said. “We don’t know what hap- 
pened to him, but it would be 
prudent to assume the Outsider 
kidnapped him. And where is the 
Outsider?” 

“Gone. And well you know it.” 
“And the other Outsiders? Do 
you know how many Outsiders 
there were? Suppose there are 
more of them aboard? Suppose 
they attack?” 

Nate hadn’t been given quite 
time to answer. “Why, you’ll 
blast them with fusion flame. 
Because you’ll be right here wait- 
ing if we need help.” 

And he was. But he hated it. 

iiTT'inar Nilsson speaking. We 
' are outside the alien ship. 
The drive system is too hot to 
get near, but we will send you 
our films. I’ve hooked the com 
laser into a teevee peeper on my 
helmet. Tim, have you found 
anything?” 

“Just this big porthole and a 
smooth hull. And cables trailing 
off in both directions. We’ll have 
to burn our way in.” 

“Through the porthole,” said 
Einar. “Otherwise we might burn 
through something explosive.” 
“He was right,” said Nick. 
“That’s a lifesystem. You can see 


a control through the glass.” 
“If it’s glass. That’s crazy en- 
gineering, Nick. Why not put 
the lifesystem last?” 

“We’ll wait and ask him.” 
“Maybe we can patent the 
idea and sell it to him. Do you 
suppose he’s just stupid?” 

“If he is, he’s clever with his 
hands.” 

“This transparent stuff has a 
twenty thousand Kelvin melting 
point,” said Einar. “But we’re 
about through. The lifesystem 
must be about out of air; we’re 
getting almost no fog through 
the cracks. Ah, we’re through.” 

A three-foot transparent disc 
puffed away on the last of 
the air, with a breath of white 
mist playing around it. Tim 
caught it and sent it gliding 
toward the Ox for later recovery. 
Einar ducked headfirst into the 
hole and pulled himself through. 
His beer belly gave him a little 
trouble. 

“I’m in a small control cabin,” 
he said and swung from the waist 
to give the teevee peeper a full 
view. Tendrils of icy fog drifted 
toward the hole in the porthole. 
“Very small. The control bank 
is almost primitively complex, 
so complex that I’m inclined to 
say the Outsider had no auto- 
pilot. No man could handle all 
these controls and adjustments. 
I see no more than one couch 


THE ADULTS 


157 


and no aliens present but me. 

“There’s a bin full of sweet 
potatoes,” he continued, “right 
beside the control couch. It’s the 
only kitchen in this section. I 
think I’ll move on.” He turned 
for a last look at the porthole, 
saw Tim hovered outside, obey- 
ing orders. “Stay out there,” he 
said. “If I need help I’ll yell.” 

He moved to the door in the 
back of the control room, tried 
to open it. Pressure forced it 
shut. He used his cutter. The 
door cut easily, much more so 
than the porthole material. He 
waited while the room filled with 
thick fog, then pushed his way in. 

“This room is bigger than the 
control room. Sorry about the 
view; we seem to have stumbled 
on a suburb of Los Angeles. The 
place seems to be a free-fall 
gymnasium.” He swept his peep- 
er around the room, then crossed 
to one of the machines and tried 
to work it. It looked like you 
were supposed to stand up in- 
side it against the force of 
springs. Einar couldn’t budge it. 

T T e disconnected the peeper 
-E-l- and aimed it at the machine, 
then tried again. 

“Either I’m doing it wrong,” 
he told his audience, “or the 
Outsider could pick his teeth 
with me. Let’s see what else there 
is.” He looked around. “That’s 
funny,” he said presently. 

158 


There was nothing else. Only 
the door to the control room. 

Three men searching for two 
hours only confirmed Einar’s 
find. The lifesystem consisted of: 

One control room the size of 
a singleship control room. 

One free-fall gymnasium, same 
size. 

A bin of roots. 

An enormous air tank. There 
were no safeties to stop the flow 
in case of puncture. The tank 
was empty. It must have been 
nearly empty when the ship 
reached the solar system. 

Vastly complex air cleaning 
machinery, apparently designed 
to remove even the faintest, rar- 
est trace of biochemical waste. 

Equally complex equipment 
for conversion of fluid and solid 
waste. 

It was incredible. The single 
Outsider had apparently spent 
his entire trip in two small rooms, 
eating just one kind of food, with 
no ship’s library to keep him en- 
tertained and no autopilot to 
keep him pointed right and 
guard his fuel supply and steer 
him clear of meteors. He must 
have done it all himself. Yet the 
trip had taken years, at least. In 
view of the complexity of the 
cleaning and renewal plants, the 
huge air tank must have existed 
solely to replace air lost by os- 
mosis through the walls! 

“That’s it,” said Einar. “I’ll 

GALAXY 


call you back in an hour, when 
we’ve analyzed this root and 
done what we can with the port- 
hole material. Leave your com 
laser pointed. Is there anything 
you especially want us to look 
for?” 

“Search the ship again,” Nick 
told them. “You may find a 
highly miniaturized autopilot 
with overrides. Could you have 
overlooked a bolthole of some 
kind? If there’s more living space 
somewhere, an Outsider may be 
in it.” He turned the volume 
down and faced Luke. “They 
won’t find anything, of course. 
The Outsider’s as big as we are, 
judging from the couch. Can you 
think of anything else?” 

“I’d like to see them analyze 
the air. And I’m particularly in- 
terested in the root.” 

“They’ll finish with the root 
by the time this beam reaches 
them,” He turned up the volume. 
“After you finish with the root, 
we’d like to know what the air’s 
made of. Then do whatever 
comes to mind. Don’t come home 
yet. Stay with the ship. If an 
emergency comes up, remember 
you’ve got a fusion flame throw- 
er. Sohl out.” 

rennan shifted. 

He hadn’t moved in hours. 
He lay on his back in the root 
bin, his eyes closed, his body 
folded into near-foetal position 


around a grossly swollen belly, 
his fists clenched. But now he 
moved one arm, and Phssthpok 
came suddenly alert. 

Brennan reached for a root, 
put it in his mouth, bit and swal- 
lowed. Bit and swallowed. Bit 
and swallowed, under Phssth- 
pok’s watchful eye. His own eyes 
stayed closed. 

Brennan’s hand released the 
last inch or so of root, and he 
turned over and stopped moving. 

Phssthpok relaxed. Presently 
he dreamed. 

The Blue Ox had circled the 
sun and was now on the other 
side of the system, headed for 
interstellar space, a good dis- 
tance from LSD4. Between the 
two ships was a communications 
gap of twenty to thirty minutes. 
Nick and Garner waited, know- 
ing that any information would 
be half an hour late. 

They had asked all the ques- 
tions, made guesses at the an- 
swers, mapped out their search 
pattern of Mars. Luke was bored. 
He missed the conveniences 
built into his travel chair. The 
ship’s library was unsatisfactory. 
He thought Nick was bored too, 
but he was wrong. In space Nick 
was silent by habit. 

The screen flashed on. The 
radio cleared its throat and 
spoke. 

“Nick Sohl, this is Tim Trues- 
dale aboard the Blue Ox.” The 



THE ADULTS 


159 


voice held barely repressed pan- 
ic; the youngish face confirmed 
it. Tim Truesdale caught on his 
own voice, then blurted, “We’re 
in trouble. We were testing that 
alien root in the chem lab, and 
Einar tried to take a bite of it. 
The damn thing was like asbes- 
tos from vacuum exposure, but 
he swallowed a piece before we 
could stop him. I can’t under- 
stand why he did it. It smelled 
awful ! 

“Einar’s sick, very sick. He 
tried to kill me when I took the 
root away from him, and now 
he’s gone into a coma. We’ve 
hooked him into the autodoc. 
The ’doc says Insufficient Da- 
ta.” They heard a ragged intake 
of breath. Suddenly Nick re- 
alized what was strange about 
Truesdale’s face. It was a flat- 
lander’s face, wide and overmus- 
cled. “We’d like permission to 
get him to a human doctor.” 

“Nick Sohl speaking. Pick a 
route and get on it. Then finish 
analyzing that root. I want to 
know what it smelled like, to 
Einar, to Nate, to you. What ex- 
actly did it remind you of? Sohl 
over.” Nick turned the volume 
off. “What the blazes got into 
him?” 

“Who?” 

“All of them, but especially 
Einar. I was his boss for a year 
before he quit politics. Why 
would he try a suicidal trick 

160 


like that?” He drummed on the 
arm of his chair, then began 
looking for Ceres with the laser. 

I n the half hour that passed be- 
fore the Blue Ox called again, 
Nick got dossiers on all three of 
her crew. 

Tim Truesdale was a flatland- 
er, sure enough. He had joined 
the Belt when he was twenty. 
Eight years later he was still 
alive; the Belt hadn’t killed him 
and probably wouldn’t. Einar 
Nilsson and Nathan La Pan were 
both Belters: Einar a broad- 
shouldered, broad-bellied giant, 
nearly fifty, running to fat and 
baldness; Nathan an eighteen- 
year old, learning the ways of 
space at apprentice pay before 
being allowed to take off in his 
own singleship. 

“That explains why they wait- 
ed for orders,” said Nick rather 
seriously. 

“Does that need an explana- 
tion?” 

“Most Belters would have 
turned back the moment Einar 
came down sick. But Truesdale’s 
still a flatlander, still used to 
being told when to breathe, and 
La Pan probably didn’t trust his 
own judgment enough to over- 
ride him.” 

“I notice the others had fewer 
childhood diseases than Trues- 
dale.” 

“We try to keep germs out of 

GALAXY 


the Belt. Did you notice anything 
else?” 

“Only his age. Nilsson was the 
oldest.” 

“I noticed that too. He was 
also the biggest. Do you — ” 

“Blue Ox calling Nick Sohl 
aboard LSD4. We’re on our way 
home. The root seems almost 
normal. High in carbohydrates, 
including righthanded sugars. 
Ordinary looking proteins. No 
vitamins at all. We found two 
compounds Nate says are brand 
new. One resembles a hormone, 
testosterone, but it definitely isn’t 
testosterone. 

“The root doesn't smell like 
anything I can name, except pos- 
sibly sour milk or sour cream. 
Nate says it smells like food 
burning, but he can’t name the 
food. 

“The Outsider ship’s air was 
thin, with an adequate partial 
pressure of oxygen, no poison- 
ous compounds, at least five per- 
cent helium. We spectroanalyzed 
the porthole material, and — ” 
He listed a spectrum of elements. 
“The ’doc still reports Einar’s 
illness as Insufficient Data, but 
now there’s an emergency light. 
Whatever it is, it isn’t good. Any 
further questions?” 

“Not at the moment,” said 
Nick and signed off. He sat 
drumming on the console with 
long, tapering fingers. 

“So,” said Luke. 


“Where’d it come from?” Nick 
wondered aloud. 

“A small world with no moon,” 
said Luke. “Moons tend to skim 
away a planet’s atmosphere. The 
Earth would be like Venus with- 
out her big oversized moon. The 
helium would be the first to go, 
wouldn’t it?” 

“Maybe. It would also be the 
first to leave a small planet. And 
think about the Outsider’s 
strength. It was no small planet 
he came from.” 

“What then?” 

“From somewhere in a gas 
cloud, with lots of helium. The 
galactic core is in the direction 
he came from. There’s lots of 
gas clouds and dust clouds in 
that direction.” 

“But they’re all an unholy dis- 
tance away. Will you stop that 
drumming?” 

“It helps me think. Like your 
smoking.” 

“Drum then.” 

“There’s no limit to how far 
he could have come. The faster 
a ramscoop ship goes, the more 
fuel it would pick up. You saw 
the intake on the drive section?” 

“There has to be a limit at 
which the exhaust velocity equals 
the velocity at which the gas hits 
the ramscoop field.” 

“True. But it must be way the 
Finale up there. That air tank 
was huge. The Outsider is a long 
way from home.”

hssthpok dreamed. 

. He sat on the floor of 
the Library with a piece of root 
in his jaws and an ancient book 
balanced on one cantaloupe knee 
and a map spread before him on 
the floor. It was a map of the 
galaxy, but it was graded for 
time. The core section showed 
as it had been a million years 
ago, but the outer arms were 
only five hundred thousand years 
old. The Library staff had spent 
most of a year preparing it for 
him. 

Assume they went a distance 
X, he told himself. Their average 
velocity must have been eleven 
thousand seven hundred thirty 
glocka per klakwhoo, considering 
dust friction and the galaxy’s 
gravitational and electromagnet- 
ic effects. Their laser returned at 
light-speed; figure for space cur- 
vature. Then X — thirty thou- 
sand one hundred and ten light- 
years. 

Phssthpok set his compass and 
drew an arc, using the Pak sun 
as a center. Margin of error: 
point zero zero one, thirty light- 
years. They're on that arc! 

Now, assume they went 
straight toward the nearest edge 
of the core. Phssthpok drew a 
radial line. Margin of error great- 
er here. Original error, course al- 
terations . And the straight 


line would have been twisted in- 
to a spiral curve during five hun- 
dred thousand years, while the 
galaxy twisted like curdled milk. 
But they must have stayed flat 
in the galactic plane. And they’re 
near this point. I’ve found them 

. Phssthpok’s minions pour- 
ing like army ants through the 
Library, Every protector in reach 
had joined his quest. It’s in the 
Astronautics Section, Pphwee. 
You’ve got to find it. We need 
those ramscoop diagrams. Ttuss, 
I need to know what happens 
when a protector gets old, and 
when it happens. It must be in 
the Medical Section. Hrathk, we 
have to learn what could stop a 
tree-of-life from growing in the 
galactic arms. Put your whole 
crew on this. Use the Valley of 
Pitchok for the experiments and 
remember the environment was 
habitable. You of the Physics 
and Engineering Sections, 1 need 
a fusion drive. Design it! Every 
childless protector on the planet 
was looking for a purpose in liv- 
ing, a Cause. And Phssthpok 
gave it to them .

ed, standing in three parts on the

below a certain speed. Meteor 
Bay has everything we need. We 
can take them! For the first time 
in fifty thousand years, the child- 
less protectors of Pak assembled 
for war . 

Phssthpok dreamed. 

Days ago he had stopped eat- 
ing. He told himself it was too 
early, but his belly didn’t believe 
it. He would live just long 
enough. Meanwhile, he dreamed. 

“How dangerous are these ap- 
proaches?” 

“Get that brave little quiver 
out of your voice,” said Nick. It 
was pure slander; Luke was 
nothing but interested. “I’ve 
made a couple of hundred of 
these in my life. For sheer thrills 
I’ve never found anything to 
beat letting you drive me to the 
spaceport.” 

“You s aid you were in a hur- 
ry.” 

“So I did. Luke, I’d like to re- 
quest an admiring silence for the 
next few minutes.” 

“Aha! Ah HA!” 

The red planet reached for 
them, unfolding like a wargod’s 
hand. Nick’s bantering mood 
drained away, and his face took 
on a set, stony look. He hadn’t 
been quite candid with Luke. He 
had made several hundred pow- 
ered approaches in his life; true. 
But those had been asteroid ap- 
proaches, with gravity negligi- 
ble or nearly so. His first landing 


approach to a planet had been 
made a week ago. 

Diemos went by in the direc- 
tion technically known as “ship’s 
upward.” Nick inched a lever 
toward him. Mars was flattening 
out and simultaneously sliding 
away as they moved north. 

“The base should be there,” 
said Luke. “At the north edge of 
that arc. Ah, that must be it, 
that little crater.” 

“Use the scope.” 

“Mmmmm . Dammit. Ah. 
There it is. Still inflated, too. See 
it, Nick?” 

“Yah.” 

f S 'he autodoc was built into the 
back wall, set over one of 
the three disaster couches. Einar 
was in that couch. His arm had 
been inserted into a slot in the 
wall. 

Tim turned to examine the 
dial faces on the autodoc. Usu- 
ally a panel covered those dials; 
a spaceship has enough gadgets 
to watch without added distrac- 
tions. Tim had been looking at 
those dials every five minutes, 
for hours. But this time they all 
showed red. 

“He’s dead,” said Tim. He 
heard the surprise in his voice 
and wondered at it. 

Nate squirmed out of the con- 
trol couch and bent over Einar. 
“And you just noticed! He must 
have been dead for an hour!”

“No, I swear ...” Tim gulped 
against the rising anaesthesia in 
his veins. His body was water. 
He was going to faint. 

“Look at his face and tell me 
that!” 

Tim climbed onto watery legs. 
He looked down at the ravaged 
face for a moment. Einar, dead, 
looked a hundred years old. In 
sorrow and guilt and repugnance, 
Tim reached to touch the dead 
cheek. 

“He’s still warm.” 

“Warm?” Nate touched the 
corpse. “He’s on fire. Fever. 
Must have been alive seconds 
ago. Sorry, buddy, I jumped at 
conclusions. But doesn’t it look 
like he’s been dead a week? Hey! 
Are you all right?” 

T he dust rose in churning 
clouds to meet their drive 
flame. Nick swore viciously and 
increased the thrust. By now 
Luke had caught on to Nick’s 
vagaries in blasphemy. When he 
swore by Finagle it was for em- 
phasis or humor. When he blas- 
phemed in Christian fashion, he 
meant it. 

The LSD 4 slowed and hover- 
ed. She was above the dust, and 
then in the dust, and gradually 
the ochre clouds thinned and 
backed away. A ring-shaped 
sandstorm receded toward three 
hundred and sixty degrees of 
horizon; and the bedrock lay 


exposed for the first time in mil- 
lenia. It was lumpy and brown 
and worn. In the light of the 
drive the rounded rock blazed 
white, with sharp black shadows. 
Where the drive flame touched 
it began to melt. 

Nick said, “I’ll have to land 
in the crater. That dust will 
flow back in as soon as I turn 
off tire motor.” He angled the 
ship left and pushed a lever for- 
ward. The bottom dropped out, 
and they fell. 

They fell all the way and 
touched with hardly a bounce. 

“Beautiful,” said Luke. 

“I do that all the time. Let’s 
get into our suits.” 

“You’ll have to carry me pig- 
gyback until we find a boat.” 

N ick opened both airlock 
doors, pulled Luke outside, 
settled him firmly on his shoul- 
ders and climbed down the lad- 
der. He had landed near the ring 
wall, which rose above them in 
worn, rounded, volcanic-looking 
stone. Dust dripped back from 
the rim, running like molasses 
down the shallow slope to collect 
in a pool around the ship’s shock 
legs. The crater was half a mile 
across. In the approximate center 
was the dome, surrounded by a 
shallow lapping sea of dust. 

“Let’s go up the wall,” said 
Nick. “The boats will be out- 
side.”

“No. There’s an opening some- 
where in the ring wall. Remem- 
ber? They moored the boats just 
outside the dome.” 

“Then where are they?” 
“Must be on the other side of 
the dome. We couldn’t see too 
well coming down.” 

Nick looked around him, 
frowning. There seemed no way 
to reach the dome without cross- 
ing the dust, which might not be 
as shallow as it looked. The cra- 
ter was ancient; it looked just 
younger than the planet itself. 
But it was riddled with younger 
cracks. Some of the edges were 
almost sharp; the air and dust 
were too thin to erode things 
quickly. There would be bad 
footing. 

Perhaps the men who built the 
dome had never needed to reach 
the ring wall, except by boat. 

He stared around the base of 
the ring wall, walking slowly and 
carefully. Luke was light on his 
shoulders, and his own body was 
light; but together they were 
top-heavy, and some of the 
cracks were concealed by fluid. 

A small, intense sun hung 
above the crater rim, in a sky 
the color of veinous blood. 

On the far side of the dome 
a narrow strip of laser-fused 
dust led from the dome to the 
ring wall. The boats were there, 
moored along the path. Dust 
had settled over them, leaving 


only flat, wide shapes the color 
of everything else. For twelve 
years they had waited for ex- 
plorers who had lost interest and 
gone home. 

It was like seeing ghosts. An 
Egyptian Pharaoh might find 
such ghosts waiting for him in 
the afterworld: rank on rank of 
dumb, faithful retainers, gone 
before him, and waiting, waiting. 

“From here they look good,” 
said Luke. “We’re in luck, Sin- 
bad.” 

‘Don’t count your money yet.” 

I t was a fifteen-minute walk 
from the ship to the ring-wall 
end of the path. Nick sighed as 
he started across the dust pond 
toward the dome. “Has it oc- 
curred to you that Lacis Solis is 
more than two thousand miles 
from here? The UN could make 
their own boats and still beat 
us.” 

“They won’t move that fast. 
Come on.” 

“The path’s slippery. Dust all 
over it.” 

The boats, four of them, were 
lined along the west side. Each 
had four seats and a pair of fans 
at the stern, below the dust line, 
with cages for protection from 
submerged rocks. The boats were 
so flat that any ocean ripple 
would have sunk them; but in 
the heavy dust they rode barely 
submerged.

GALAXY 


Nick dropped his burden not 
too gently into one of the seats. 
“See if she’ll start, Luke. I’m 
going to the dome for fuel.” 

“It’ll be hydrazine, with com- 
pressed Martian air as oxidizer.” 
“I’ll just look for a fuel tank, 
if it’s okay with you.” 

Luke was able to start the 
compressor, but the motor 
wouldn’t fire. Probably drained 
the tanks, he decided and turned 
everything off. He found a bub- 
ble dome collapsed in the back. 
After making sure it was meant 
to be worked manually, he wres- 
tled it into place and sealed it 
down, holding himself in place 
with a seat belt to get leverage. 
His long arms and wide hands 
had never lost an arm wrestling 
match. The edges of the bubble 
probably leaked, he decided, but 
not seriously. He found the in- 
spection hatch that concealed an 
air converter for changing the 
nitric acid outside into breath- 
able nitrogen and oxygen. 

Nick returned with a green 
tank balanced on one shoulder. 
He fueled the boat through an 
injector nozzle. Luke tried the 
starter again. It worked. The 
boat tried to take off without 
Nick. Luke found the neutral 
setting, then reverse. Nick wait- 
ed while he backed up. 

“How do I get through the 
bubble?” 

“I guess you don’t.” Luke col- 


lapsed the bubble, unsealed one 
side for Nick, then sealed it after 
him. The bubble began to fill, 
slowly. “Best keep our suits on,” 
said Luke. “It may be hours be- 
fore we can breathe in here.” 
“You can collapse it then. 
We’ve got to get provisions from 
the ship.” 

I t was two hours before they 
raised the bubble and started 
for the opening in the ring wall. 

The cliffs that framed the 
opening were sharp and sheer, 
clearly dynamite-blasted, as ar- 
tificial as the glassy path be- 
tween dome and ring wall. Nak- 
ed black rock glared down at 
them as they passed between. 
Nick was settled comfortably in 
one of the passenger chairs, his 
feet up on another, his eyes rest- 
ing casually on the screen of the 
deep-radar mounted on the side 
of the boat. 

“Seems deep enough,” he said. 
“Then I’ll open her up,” said 
Luke. The fans spun; the boat’s 
stern dipped far down, then 
righted. In seconds they were 
skimming across the dust at 
forty knots, leaving as a wake 
only two straight, shallow, regu- 
lar swells. 

The deep-radar image regis- 
tered as a contour map. It show- 
ed a smooth bottom, regular 
swells and dips from which mil- 
lions of years had eliminated all

sharp lines and points. There 
was little volcanic activity on 
Mars. 

The desert was as flat as a 
mirror. Rounded dun-colored 
rocks poked through its surface, 
incongruous, Daliesque. Craters 
sat on the dust like badly made 
clay ash trays. Some were a few 
inches across. Others beyond the 
horizon would measure miles, or 
tens of miles. The horizon was 
straight and close and razor 
sharp, glowing yellow below and 
artery red above. Nick turned his 
head to watch the crater recede. 

His eyes widened, then squint- 
ed. Something? 

‘Damn’t. Hold it!” he shouted. 
“Turn around! Turn hard left!” 

“Back toward the crater?” 

“Yes!” 

Luke cut the power in one 
motor. The boat turned its prow 
to the left but continued to skid 
sideways across the dust. Then 
the right fan bit in, and the boat 
curved around. 

“I see it,” said Luke. 

It was little more than a dot 
at that distance, but it showed 
clearly against the calm mono- 
chromatic sea around it. And it 
moved. It jerked, it remained 
quiescent, it jerked again, rolling 
sideways. It was several hundred 
yards from the crater wall. 

As they approached, it grew 
clearer. It was cylindrical, the 
shape of a short caterpillar, and 


translucent; and soft, for they 
could see it bend as it moved. It 
was trying to reach the opening 
in the ring wall. 

Luke throttled down. The 
dustboat slowed and settled 
deeper. As they pulled along- 
side Luke was startled to see 
that Nick had armed himself 
with a signal gun, a rocket pistol 
with an exploding warhead of 
ultrafine dust. Such a pistol 
could call for help, but at close 
range it could also kill. 

“It’s him,” said Nick. He lean- 
ed over the side, gun at the ready. 

T he caterpillar was a transpar- 
ent, inflated sack. Inside was 
something that rolled over and 
over, slowly and painfully, try- 
ing to get closer to the side of 
the boat. It was as clearly alien 
as anything created in tire days 
of flat television. 

It was humanoid, as much so 
as a stick-figure drawing is hu- 
manoid. But it was all knobs. 
Elbows, knees, shoulders, cheek- 
bones, they stuck out like mar- 
bles or grapefruits or bowling 
balls. The head was a small wa- 
termelon swelling and rising like 
hydrocephalus. 

It stopped trying to roll when 
it bumped against the boat in 
its pressurized prison. 

“He looks helpless enough,” 
Nick said dubiously. 

“Well, here goes our air again.” 


168 


GALAXY 


Luke deflated the bubble. The 
two men reached over the side, 
picked up the pressurized sack 
and dropped it in the bottom of 
the boat. The alien’s expression 
did not change and probably 
could not. But it did a strange 
thing. With thumb and forefin- 
ger of a strangely human, strang- 
ly inhuman hand, it made a cir- 
cle. 

Nick said, “He must have 
learned that from Brennan.” 

“Look at the joints, Nick. It 
looks like you could name every 
one of them.” 

“His arms are too long for 
human. And his back slopes 
more.” 

“Yah. Well, we can’t take it 
back to the ship, and we can’t 
talk to it the way it is now. We’ll 
have to wait out here while the 
bubble inflates.” 

seem to spend most of 
* ’ our time waiting,” said 
Luke. 

Nick nodded. His fingers, 
drummed against the back of a 
chair. For half an hour the boat’s 
small converter had been strain- 
ing to fill the bubble, using and 
changing the thin, poisonous 
mixture outside. 

But the alien hadn’t moved at 
all. Luke had been watching. 
The alien lay in its inflated bag 
in the bottom of the boat, and 
it waited. Its human eyes watch- 


ed them from inside pits of 
tough, leathery wrinkles. No 
part of it moved except its eyes. 
Just so, with just such patience, 
might a dead man wait for Judg- 
ment Day. 

“At least we have it at a dis- 
advantage,” said Nick. “It won’t 
be kidnapping us.” 

“I think he must be insane.” 
“Insane? Its motives may be 
a little strange — ” 

“Look at the evidence. He 

comes plowing into the system in 
a ship just adequate to get him 
here. His air tank was on its last 
gasp. There was no evidence of 
fail-safe devices anywhere 
aboard ship. He made no at- 

tempt to contact anyone, as far 
as we can tell. He kills or kidnaps 
Brennan. He then proceeds to 
abandon his interstellar drive 
and run for Mars, presumably 
to hide. Now he’s abandoned his 
re-entry vehicle and whatever’s 
left of Brennan too; he’s rolled 
halfway around Mars in a 

sandwich bag to reach the first 

place any exploring ship would 
land! He’s a nut. Too many 
years between stars in too small 
a place have stirred his brains 
with an eggbeater.” 

“You keep saying him. It’s an 
it. Think of it as an it, and you’ll 
be ready for it to act odd.” 
“That’s a cop-out. The uni- 
verse is rational. In order to sur- 
vive, this thing has to be rational

too, wherever he, she or it is 
from.” 

“Another couple of minutes 
and we can — ” 

The alien moved. Its hand 
slashed with blurring speed down 
the length of the sack. Instantly 
Nick raised the signal gun. In- 
stantly . but the alien reached 
through a long slit in the sack 
and took the gun out of Nick’s 
hand before he could fire. There 
was no sign of haste. It tossed 
the gun into the back of the boat 
and sat up. 

It spoke. Its voice was full of 
clickings and rustlings and pop- 
pings. The flat, hard beak must 
have been a handicap. But its 
speech could be understood. 

It said, “Take me to your 
leader.” 

Nick recovered first. He 
straightened his shoulders, clear- 
ed his throat and said, “That 
will involve a trip of several 
days. Meanwhile, may I welcome 
you to the dominion of human- 
ity?” 

“You may not,” said the mon- 
ster. “I hate to ruin your whole 
day. My name’s Jack Brennan, 
and I’m a Belter. Aren’t you 
Nick Sohl?” 

IX 

T he awful silence rocked to the 
sound of Luke’s laughter. 
“You think of it as an it instead 


of a him, and you’ll be ready 
for s-strange-h-hahaha ...” 

Nick felt panic close around 
his throat. “You. You’re Bren- 
nan?” 

“Yah. And you’re Nick Sohl. I 
saw you once in Confinement. 
But I don’t recognize your 
friend.” 

“Lucas Garner.” Luke had 
himself under control. “Your 
photographs don’t do you justice, 
Brennan.” 

“I did something stupid,” said 
the Brennan-monster. Its voice 
was no more human, its appear- 
ance was no less intimidating, 
than before it had announced it- 
self as Brennan. “I went to meet 
the Outsider. You were trying 
to do the same weren’t you?” 

“Yes.” There was a sardonic 
amusement in Luke’s eyes and in 
Luke’s voice. He may or may 
not have believed the Brennan- 
monster, but either way he was 
enjoying the situation. “Was 
there really an Outsider, Bren- 
nan?” 

“Unless you want to quibble 
about definitions, yes.” 

Sohl broke in. “For God’s sake, 
Brennan! What happened to 
you?” 

“That’s a long story,” said the 
Brennan-monster. “And I’m go- 
ing to tell it all, right here. To 
make it easier for you to under- 
stand, I’d like to tell it my own 
way, so please maintain a re-

spectful silence, remembering 
that if I hadn’t gotten in the way 
you’d look just like me.” He 
looked hard at the two men. “I’m 
wrong. You wouldn’t. You’re 
both too old. Well, bear with me. 
I’m going to tell you about a 
race of bipeds that lives near the 
edge of the spherical globe of 
close-packed suns at the core of 
the galaxy . 

< * < * r T~'he most important thing 
A about them is that they 
live in three stages of maturity. 
There is childhood, which is self- 
explanitory. There is the breed- 
er stage, a biped just short of 
intelligence, whose purpose is to 
create more children. And there 
is the protector. 

“At the age of forty-two, Earth 
time, the breeder stage gets the 
urge to eat the root of a certain 
bush. Up to then he stayed away 
from it, because its smell was re- 
pugnant to him. Suddenly it 
smells delicious. This bush grows 
all over the planet; there’s no 
real chance that the root won’t 
be available to any breeder who 
lives long enough to want it. 

“The root initiates certain 
changes, both physical and emo- 
tional. But before I go into them, 
I’ll let you in on the big secret. 
The race I speak of calls itself 
— ” The Brennan-monster click- 
ed its horny beak sharply to- 
gether. “We call it Peking Man.” 


“What?” Nick seemed forced 
into the position of straight man, 
and he didn’t like it. But Luke 
sat hugging his useless legs to 
his chest, grinning with wicked 
enjoyment. 

“Peking Man. There was an 
expedition that landed on Earth 
some five hundred thousand 
years ago. The bush they needed 
wouldn’t grow, so there haven’t 
been any protector stage Paks 
on Earth. I’ll get to that. 

“When a breeder eats the root, 
these changes take place. His 
or her gonads and obvious sexual 
characteristics disappear. His 
skull softens, and his brain be- 
gins to grow until it is comfort- 
ably larger and more complex 
than yours, gentlemen. The skull 
then hardens and develops a 
bony crest. The teeth fall out, 
whatever teeth are left; the gums 
and lower lips grow together and 
form a hard, flat beak. All hair 
disappears. Some joints swell 
enormously, to supply much 
greater leverage to the muscles. 
The skin hardens and wrinkles 
to form a kind of armor. Finger- 
nails become claws, retractile, 
so that a protector’s fingertips 
are actually more sensitive than 
before, and better toolmakers. A 
simple heart forms where the two 
veins from the legs, whatever the 
hell they’re called, join to ap- 
proach the heart. Notice that my 
armor skin is thicker there? Well, 


THE ADULTS

there are less dramatic changes, 
but they all contribute to make 
the protector a powerful, intelli- 
gent fighting machine. 

“The emotional changes are 
drastic. A protector who has bred 
true feels no urge except the urge 
to protect those of his blood line. 
He recognizes them by smell. 
His increased intelligence does 
him no good here, because his 
hormones rule his motives. Does 
it occur to you that every change 
I’ve described is a kind of exag- 
geration of what happens to men 
and women when they get old?” 
“Yes, but — ” 

“The extra heart,” Luke broke 
in. “What about that?” 

“Like the expanded brain, it 
doesn’t form without tree-of-life. 
After fifty, without modern med- 
ical care, a normal human heart 
becomes inadequate. Eventually 
it stops.” 

“Ah.” 

66 A bout that colony. There’s 
no need to dwell on it. A 
big ship arrived here, and four 
Landing craft went down with 
some thirty protectors and a lot 
of breeders. A year later the pro- 
tectors realized they’d picked the 
wrong planet. The tree they 
needed never came up. They sent 
a message for help, by laser, and 
then they died. Starvation is a 
normal death for a protector, 
but it’s usually voluntary. These 


starved against their will.” The 
Brennan-monster paused. There 
was no sign of emotion in voice 
or masklike face. 

“They died. The breeders were 
breeding without check. What 
happened is largely speculation 
on my part, but I’m pretty sure 
I’m right. The landing craft was 
fission powered. The protectors 
were dead, but the breeders were 
used to their helping out, so they 
hung around the ships.” 

“And?” 

“And the piles got hot without 
the protectors to keep them bal- 
anced. Maybe they exploded. 
The radiation caused all kinds 
of strange mutations. Everything 
from lemurs to apes and chim- 
panzees to ancient and modem 
man.” 

“I don’t believe it,” said Nick. 

“You will. You should now. 
There’s enough evidence of it, 
particularly in religions and folk 
tales. What percentage of hu- 
manity genuinely expects to live 
forever? Why do so many reli- 
gions include a race of immortal 
beings who are constantly bat- 
tling one another? What’s the 
justification for ancestor wor- 
ship? You know what happens to 
a man without modern geriatrics; 
he gets stupid as he gets old. Yet 
people tend to respect him, to 
listen to him. Where do guardian 
angels come from?” 

“Race memory?” 


172 


GALAXY 


“Maybe. Or half a million 
years of tradition, if you’ll be- 
lieve a tradition could last that 
long. It could, if every man, 
woman and child on Earth began 
by believing it.” 

“South Africa,” said Luke. He 
believed the Brennan -monster. 
The Outsider’s actions had been 
so irrational that he had been 
forced to expect an irrational ex- 
planation. “They must have 
landed in South Africa. All the 
primates are there, except Man.” 

“ 6 O ight. You see, the breeders 
had lost their ability to 
become protectors. They had to 
develop other shticks, to protect 
themselves. There was radiation 
around to help them change, 
and the protectors had made the 
environment temporarily safe for 
them, so the population could 
expand. Some got strength, some 
got agility, some got intelli- 
gence.” 

“I seem to remember,” said 
Luke, “that the aging process in 
man can be compared to the pro- 
gram running out in a space 
probe. Once the probe has done 
its work it doesn’t matter what 
happens to it. Similarly, once we 
pass the age at which we can 
have children — ” 

“You’re moving on inertia on- 
ly, following your course with 
no corrective mechanisms.” The 
Brennan-monster nodded. “Of 


course the tree-of-life root sup- 
plies the program for the third 
stage. Good comparison.” 

Nick said, “What about the 
Outsider?” 

“He found old records, includ- 
ing the call for help. He was the 
first protector in half a million 
years to realize that there was 
a way to find Earth, or at least 
to narrow the search. And he had 
no children, so he had to find a 
cause quick, before the urge to 
eat left him. That’s what hap- 
pens to a protector when his 
blood line is dead. More lack of 
programming. Incidentally you 
might note the heavy protection 
against mutation in the Pak spe- 
cies. A mutation doesn’t smell 
right. That could be important 
in the galactic core, where radia- 
tion must be heavy.” 

“So he came barreling out here 
with a hold full of seeds?” 

“And bags of thalium oxide. 
Thalium was what was lacking 
in Earth’s soil, and the oxide 
was easiest to carry. The con- 
struction of his ship bothered me 
until I understood it, but you 
can see why he trailed his cargo 
section behind the lifesystem. 
Radiation doesn’t matter to him, 
in small amounts. He can’t have 
children.” 

“And where is he now?” 

“I had to kill him.” 

“What?” Garner was shocked 
at last. “Did he attack you?” 


THE ADULTS 


173 


“No.” 

“Then why?” 

The Brennan-monster seemed 
to hesitate. It said, “Garner, 
Sohl, listen to me. Fifteen hun- 
dred miles from here, some fifty 
feet under the sand, is part of 
an alien spacecraft filled with 
roots and seeds and bags of tha- 
lium oxide. The roots I can grow 
from those seeds can make a man 
nearly immortal. What do you 
think will happen next?” 

The two men looked at each 
other. Luke seemed about to 
speak, closed his mouth. 

“That’s a tough one, right? So 
what did the Outsider expect? 
Why did he bring all those roots 
and seeds?” 

X 

TJlissthpok dreamed. 

-*■ He knew to within a day 
just how long it would take for 
Brennan to wake up. He could 
have been wrong, of course. But 
if he were, then Brennan’s kind 
had mutated too far from the 
Pak form and would not be 
worth protecting. 

Knowing how long he had, 
Phssthpok could time his dream- 
ing. Dreaming was a fine art to 
a protector. He had about ten 
days. For a week he dreamed 
about the past, up until the day 
he left the Pak planet. Then he 
moved on to the future. 


Phssthpok dreamed . 

It would begin when his cap- 
tive woke. From the looks of 
him, the captive’s brain would 
be larger than Phssthpok’s; there 
was that frontal bulge, ruining 
the slope of the face. He would 
learn fast. Phssthpok would 
teach him how to be a protector 
and what to do with the roots 
and seeds of tree-of-life. 

Probably the native would 
take the secret for his own, using 
tree-cf-life to make protectors 
of his own descendants. That was 
all right. If he had sense enough 
to spread his family around, 
avoiding incest, his bloodline 
would reach out to include most 
of this system’s Pak race. 

Probably he would kill Phssth- 
pok to keep the secret. That too 
was all right. 

There was a nightmare tinge 
to Phssthpok’s dreaming. For the 
captive didn’t look right. His fin- 
gernails were developing wrong. 
His head was certainly not the 
right shape. His beak was as flat 
as his face had been. His back 
wasn’t arched, his legs were 
wrong, his arms were too short. 
His kind had had too much time 
to mutate. 

But he’d reacted correctly to 
the roots. 

The future was uncertain . 
except for Phssthpok. Let the 
captive learn what he needed to 
know, if he could; let him carry

GALAXY 


on the work, if he could. There 
would come a day when Earth 
was a second Pak world. Phssth- 
pok had done his best. He would 
teach and die. 

T>rennan stirred. He unfolded 
■* ^ his curled body, stretched 
wide and opened his eyes. For a 
few moments he stared at Phssth- 
pok, stared as if he were reading 
the protector’s mind. Then he 
began to speak. 

In two days he had learned 
the language. On the third day, 
as Phssthpok was demonstrating 
how to unfreeze the seeds with- 
out damage, Brennan slammed 
his head against the edge of the 
freezer. It stunned the protector 
just long enough to let Brennan 
turn him around and break his 
neck against the edge. 

“I wonder if I can make you 
understand,” said the Brennan- 
monster. He gazed at the two 
old men, one twice the age of the 
other but both old, and wonder- 
ed that they should be his judges. 

“I wonder if you can under- 
stand how fast it was.” He kept 
his speech dead slow, slow 
enough for them (hopefully) to 
understand it. “He had the box 
open and was giving me instruc- 
tions in that oddly speedy lan- 
guage of his, giving orders just 
as if I were a voice-box com- 
puter. I was about to ask, ‘Don’t 
I get any choices at all?’ 


“I was too intelligent. I was 
getting answers before I could 
finish formulating a question. 
And always I saw the best an- 
swer, and always it was the only 
choice. My free will was gone. 
And is. I wondered if the Out- 
sider had free will. 

“In that same instant I at- 
tacked him with intent to kill. 
Every step in the argument was 
in place, and there was no choice 
at all.” 

“Lucky you could act so fast. 
I gather he was dangerous?” 
“Not to me, not yet. I was his 
shining hope. He couldn’t have 
defended himself for fear of 
bruising me. He was older than 
me and knew how to fight; he 
could have killed me if he’d 
wanted to. But he couldn’t want 
to. 

“It took him thirty thousand 
years of real time to bring us 
those roots. He expected me to 
finish the job. I think he died 
believing he’d succeeded. He 
half-expected me to kill him, 
you see.” 

Sohl said, “And?” 

The Brennan-monster shrug- 
gted cantaloupe shoulders. “He 
was wrong, of course. I killed 
him because he would have tried 
to wipe out the human race when 
he learned the whole truth.” He 
reached into the bag that had 
brought him across fifteen hun- 
dred miles of fluid dust. He pull- 


THE ADULTS 


175 


ed out a jury-rigged something- 
or-other that hummed softly — 
his air plant, made from parts of 
Phssthpok’s control board — and 
dropped it in the boat. Next he 
pulled out half of a yellow root 
like a raw sweet potato. He held 
it under Garner’s nose. “Smell 
this.” 

L uke sniffed. “Kind of pleas- 
ant. Like a liqueur.” 

“Sohl?” 

“Nice.” 

“If you knew it would turn 
you into something like me, 
would you take a bite? Garner?” 
“This instant. I’d like to live 
forever, and I’m afraid of going 
senile.” 

“Sohl?” 

“No. I’m not ready to give up 
sex yet.” 

“How old are you, Sohl?” 
“Seventy-four. Birthday two 
months from now.” 

“You’re already too old. You 
were too old at fifty; it would 
have killed you. Would you have 
volunteered at forty-five?” 

Sohl laughed. “Certainly not.” 
“Well, that’s half the answer. 
From Phssthpok’s point of view, 
we’re a failure. The other half is 
that I don’t intend to turn tree- 
of-life loose on Earth or any- 
where else.” 

“I should hope not,” said Gar- 
ner. “But let’s hear your rea- 
sons.” 

176 


“Did you see the Outsider 
ship?” 

“We saw films.” 

“Odd, wasn’t it? A weird 
combination of primitive and 
complex. There’s a reason for 
that. The Pak planet has never 
been free of war at any time in 
its history. Naturally not, with 
every protector single-mindedly 
acting to expand and protect 
his blood line at the expense of 
all the others. Knowledge keeps 
getting lost, and the race can’t 
co-operate for a single minute 
beyond the point where one 
protector sees an advantage in 
betraying the others. They can’t 
make any kind of permanent 
progress because of that con- 
tinual state of war. 

“Can you imagine a thousand 
protectors on Earth deciding 
their grandchildren need more 
room? All they’d have to do 
would be to steal a few fusion 
plants.” 

He didn’t have to expand 
that point. Fusion plants were 
as common on Earth as electri- 
cal generators had been a cen- 
tury earlier. There were tens 
of thousands of spacecraft; there 
were seawater distilleries and 
power plants and public crema- 
toriums. And each could become 
an exploding bomb at a flick of 
the switch that controlled its 
fusion shield. 

“Besides which, we don’t need 

GALAXY 


tree-of-life, not really. Garner, 
when were you bom? Nineteen 
forty or thereabouts?” 

“Thirty-nine.” 

“And look how old you are 
now. The science of geriatrics is 
moving so fast that my kids have 
a good chance of living for thou- 
sands of years. We’ll get our im- 
mortality without tree-of-life, 
without sacrificing anything at 
all.” 

“Now look at it from the Out- 
sider’s viewpoint,” the Brennan- 
monster went on. “We’ve settled 
the solar system and are on the 
verge of moving out to the stars. 
We will and must refuse to use 
trce-of-life, and even when it’s 
forced on us the resulting mu- 
tated protectors are atypical. 
The Outsider was used to think- 
ing in terms of the long view. 
He’d have realized that someday 
we’ll reach the core. The Pak will 
attack us the moment they see 
us, and we’ll fight back.” He 
shrugged. “And win, of course. 
The Pak won’t unite effectively, 
and we’ll have a much better 
technology.” 

“We will?” 

“I told you, they can’t keep 
their technology. Whatever can’t 
be used immediately gets lost 
unless someone files it in the 
Library. Military knowledge 
never gets filed; the families 
keep it a deep, dark secret. And 
the only ones to use the Library 


are the childless protectors. 
There aren’t many of them, and 
they aren’t highly motivated.” 

“He’d have tried to wipe us 
out first,” said Luke. 

“Right. You might remember 
that we would have been infinite- 
ly worse to him than a hostile 
alien species. We’re mutants, 
corruptions of the Pak form it- 
self.” 

“But he couldn’t do it. He was 
all alone.” 

“I’ve thought of half-a-dozen 
things he could have done. None 
of them sure things, but I 
couldn’t risk it. Remember that 
the Outsider was a fanatic and 
more intelligent than most hu- 
man geniuses. They all are. 

“If only they’d had the ability 
to play ...” 

T he sun had almost touched 
the horizon. Luke shivered 
and started the motors. He didn’t 
want to have to navigate the 
opening in the ring wall in dark- 
ness. 

Presently Nick said, “What 
about the seeds? Do we just leave 
them where they are?” 

“Not at all. Sohl, when you 
have finally grasped the extent 
of my magnificient intelligence, 
you’ll see what those seeds rep- 
resent. They’re a fail-safe for 
the human race. If we ever real- 
ly need a leader, we can make 
one. We’ll just pick a forty-two-

177 


year-old volunteer and turn him 
or her loose in the tree-of-life 
patch, making sure that he or 
she has no children.” 

“Children. You’ve got children, 
Brennan.” 

“Yes,” said the Brennan-mon- 
ster. “But fear not. I don’t in- 
tend to hover over them the rest 
of their lives. They’ll have a 
much better chance for happi- 
ness without that.” 

“The hormone changes didn’t 
work?” 

“I think they did. At least to 
some extent. What the Outsider 
never realized was that most of 
the protector’s urge to die after 
his bloodline is dead is sociolo- 
gical. Some is hormones, but 
more is training. I don’t have 
that training, that conviction 
that a breeder can’t be happy 
or safe without his ancestors 
constantly telling him what to 
do. I don’t intend to let them 
know I’m alive. That would hurt 
them.” 

“We’ll give it out that the Out- 
sider killed you.” 

“Good.” The Brennan-monster 
lay flat on his back in the bot- 
tom of the boat as it slowed for 
the opening in the ring wall. 
Nothing moved but his eyes. The 
Brennan-monster had the ability 
to relax. Somewhere in the future 
there would be regular periods of 
furious exercise . 


“What of you, Brennan?” 
“I can’t protect my kids be- 
cause of the Principle of Uncer- 
tainty. I can’t watch them with- 
out affecting them. But I can 
protect the human race. Some- 
day it may be necessary. Mean- 
while, I’ll be a gardener. Pick 
me an asteroid, and I’ll raise 
tree-of-life.” 

From the front of the boat, 
Luke said, “I just thought of 
something. You know the story 
of Genesis?” 

“Yes.” 

Luke pulled out a cigarette. 
“You remember that Adam and 
Eve ate from the tree of knowl- 
edge. According to Genesis, the 
reason they were thrown out was 
that they might have eaten from 
the tree of life, to live forever. 
That would have made them 
equivalent to angels. Now you 
tell us they were the same tree.” 
He used his lighter. “Wha — ” 

In one fluid motion the Bren- 
nan-monster was beside him. He 
took the cigarette from Luke’s 
mouth stubbed it out against the 
side of the boat. Luke glared. 

“Sorry,” said the Brennan- 
monster. “The hormones worked 
after all. I’m a protector.” 

It was as fair a warning as the 
two ex-breeders would get. The 
Brennan-monster’s motives would 
always be as clear as empty 
space. —LARRY NIVEN

Alien's Bequest 

by CHARLES V. DeVET 


He came from space to bring us 
a gift we didn't want to take! 


■X TThen the alien spaceship 
’ * crash-landed its lone occu- 
pant was killed — yet it did not 
die. And one day later it disap- 
peared. 

Abruptly St. Paul, Minnesota 
— site of the landing — became 
a closed city. Few went in, and 
none came out. 

My newspaper pulled strings 
for a week, and I found myself 
on a plane with Joseph F. Kas- 
per, Presidential trouble shooter. 

We flew over the city, low 
enough to see a cordon of nation- 
al guardsmen and a tight line of 
boats blocking the port area on 
the Mississippi. A corpsman met 
us in the compound at Navy Is- 
land. 


“I’m to take you directly to the 
staff room, sirs,” the corpsman in- 
formed us. “Mr. Rauen is wait- 
ing.” That would be Edward 
Rauen, State Department man in 
charge of the project. 

Rauen greeted us at the door 
of the staff room. We introduced 
ourselves, and the big man shook 
our hands. “Glad to have you 
with us,” he said. 

“I understand three men died 
here yesterday,” Kasper got di- 
rectly down to business. 

“Yes,” Rauen answered. “With 
broken necks. A biologist here 
at the center, and two national 
guardsmen in the Pigseye area.” 
“By the alien?” 

“We assume so.” 


179 


“Why those particular men?” 
“We figure the biologist came 
on something. Our visitor killed 
him and killed the guardsmen in 
trying to escape.” 

“Did he escape?” 

“We’re quite certain he didn’t,” 
Rauen answered. “He was 
stopped at the first guard line.” 
He introduced us to the other 
two people in the room, a Miss 
Carole Schoppert, pathologist on 
the project, and a Mr. Leo Scan- 
lon, technician. 

“What do you have on the 
creature so far?” Kasper asked 
as we seated ourselves. 

“Very little, except that it can 
assume different shapes. We sus- 
pect that presently it is masquer- 
ading as a human. That would be 
its best disguise. But I think we’d 
better start at the beginning. I’ll 
show you the pictures we have.” 
Rauen turned to the technician. 
“Will you handle the projector, 
Mr. Scanlon?” 

Hphe opening scene on the screen 
-®- appeared as a ball of light, 
coalesced into a spaceship, and 
came at the camera like a blue- 
black bullet fired from a gun. Its 
speed slackened abruptly. It 
bucked a half dozen times, rapid- 
ly, and began a slow spinning fall. 

“That’s where our visitor died, 
apparently,” Rauen said. “Ex- 
cept . Will you proceed, Mr. 
Scanlon?” 

180 


In the next scene the spaceship 
had been opened, and the alien 
lay on the grass a few yards 
away. Scanlon brought the 
camera into closeup focus. 

The outworlder was lying on 
his side, with his legs coiled be- 
hind him, without knee-break, 
resembling half-coiled springs. He 
was unclothed and squat, with a 
tough-textured, satin-black skin. 
His one eye was protuberant, 
with a light center and no visible 
white at the outsides. It was a 
strong face, but laced with the 
fine deep lines of an old man. 

The side of the alien’s head 
nearest us had been battered and 
crushed. 

“Observe this now,” Rauen 
cautioned. “Taken one hour 
later.” 

The outline of the alien had be- 
come blurred, with the facial fea- 
tures seeming about to run one 
into another. 

“Another hour,” Rauen said. 
The alien body had melted into 
a soft block of blackgel. 

Kasper all this while had been 
sitting alertly passive. Now he 
asked, “Is it possible for a body 
to decompose that fast?” 

“No,” Rauen answered. “Closer 
study showed the thing was still 
alive. It had lost its shape, but 
there was no putrefacation or ac- 
tual tissue deterioration. It re- 
tained a consistent body tempera- 
ture and fluid circulation. We 

GALAXY 


might think of it as a protoplas- 
mic mass, but it definitely is not 
dead.” 

“How did it escape?” Kasper 
asked. “Can something like that 
move?” 

“Small portions of it, let’s say, 
writhed constantly,” Rauen said. 
“But whether or not it was loco- 
motory we never did learn. 

“This next picture will show 
how it escaped,” Rauen contin- 
ued. “I had Mr. Scanlon set his 
camera on automatic so we’d miss 
nothing during the night. This is 
the result.” 

/"vur attention moved back to 
tire screen, where a brown 
mongrel dog lay on the grass 
on the spot where the alien had 
been before. The dog was not 
moving, but its side rose heavily 
and quite rapidly, as though it 
had just run a long distance. It 
was covered with a thick film of 
dull matter that resembled mud. 
Other matter lay all about it in 
a damp pool. 

As he watched the dog rose 
awkwardly. With its legs spread 
wide it shook most of the black 
substance from its body, and 
ambled out of the picture. 

“That’s it,” Rauen said. “That’s 
all we have on the thing.” 

“Did you search for the dog?” 
Kasper asked. 

“Of course. We never did find 
it.” The question had obviously 

ALIEN'S BEQUEST 


irked Rauen. Something about 
the personalities of these two men 
clashed. 

“How much of that protoplas- 
mic matter remained after the 
dog left?” Kasper asked next. 

“In volume, approximately the 
same as before,” Carole Schoppert 
spoke now. “Except that it was 
dead matter then, not protoplas- 
mic. We found another pool of 
it on the other side of the ship. 
We suspect it changed shapes 
again there, from the dog to a 
human.” 

Kasper turned his attention to 
the girl. She was a beautiful 
woman, I had noted earlier, with 
blonde hair set in a high fashioned 
updo. Kasper’s glance showed ap- 
preciation of her slim-lined, long- 
legged body. 

“Where did the excess matter 
come from?” Kasper asked. 

Carole hesitated. “That is one 
of the mysteries we haven’t yet 
solved.” 

Slowly Kasper turned back to 
Rauen. “I’d like the names of all 
who had near contact with the 
alien before it disappeared,” he 
said. “Can you get them for me?” 

“We already have such a list,” 
Rauen answered. “And we have 
investigated everyone on it, 
thoroughly.” 

Kasper went through a reflec- 
tive moment. “About all I have 
to suggest is that we send what 
we have to Washington. I’d like 

181 


to see what the big Honeywell 
computer makes of it.” 

The meeting ended shortly 
after. 

T hat night two more men died 
— Both lab men, again with 
broken necks. The situation was 
fast becoming critical. 

The report from the computer 
arrived early the next morning. 
Rauen brought it to Kasper while 
I was visiting him. 

Kasper read it aloud: 

TWO POSSIBILITIES PRE- 
SENT THEMSELVES. ONE, 
THE ALIEN HAS THE ABILI- 
TY TO REDUCE ITSELF TO 
BASIC MATTER AND CAN 
INVADE A BODY BY RE- 
PLACING ITS ACTUAL MO- 
LECULAR SUBSTANCE. SEC- 
OND POSSIBILITY, SYMBIO- 
SIS. 

“Symbiosis.” Kasper toyed with 
the word. 

“The dictionary defines it as, 
‘organisms living together whose 
union is advantageous to both,’ ” 
Rauen said. “Termites and the 
symbiotic organisms in their in- 
testines would be a good exam- 
ple.” 

Kasper went through another of 
his moments of deep thought, 
then asked, apparently irrelevant- 
ly, “I understand you were the 
one who suggested — after the 
alien disappeared — that it be 
killed on sight?” 


“I did.” Rauen was instantly 
defensive. A flush of blood in his 
cheeks matched their color to his 
red hair. I saw that by now he 
thoroughly disapproved of Kas- 
per. “You should recognize the 
potential danger here,” he said. 
“Undoubtedly the creature has 
some means of reproduction. 
Probably amoebalike. Such a 
creature, if it escaped, could 
spread over the world and, being 
hostile, could cause any amount 
of mischief. I decided to take no 
chances.” He paused. “You are 
aware, I presume, that it has al- 
ready killed five men?” 

“It was potentially dangerous, 
yes,” Kasper admitted. “But after 
you’d taken the necessary pre- 
cautions to prevent it escaping, 
shouldn’t you then have tried to 
capture rather than destroy it? 
It might have killed as a direct 
result of your order — because 
it was menaced, or in its efforts 
to survive, and not because it 
was hostile.” 

“If it wasn’t hostile, why did it 
disappear?” Rauen countered. 

“A strange environment is al- 
ways fearsome,” Kasper said, 
then smiled self-consciously. “To 
quote a line I once read some- 
where,” he added. He too was a 
big man, but dark, less excitable 
and more introspective than 
Rauen. 

“You are a philosopher also?” 
Rauen asked with courtesy. 


182 


GALAXY 


asper’s smile widened into 
^ mild embarrassment. “From 
the computer’s suggestions,” he 
changed the subject, “I’d guess 
that our alien is actually a sym- 
biotic organism. But I would add 
this: It is not a reasoning organ- 
ism. Its actions are all instinctive. 
It would experience emotions only 
as they are reflected by its host. 
And respond to those emotions as 
a worm, say, or other lower or- 
ganism responds to stimuli.” 
“You saw the pictures,” Rauen 
demurred impatiently. “It was a 
manlike creature, more or less.” 
“That manlike creature might 
have been only a carrier. Remem- 
ber the computer’s first sugges- 
tion? We thought it took the 
shape of a dog, and later that of 
a human. More likely it invaded 
the dog, and later a human. 
Probably in an instinctive urge to 
seek a host with highest intelli- 
gence.” 

This stopped Rauen, but only 
momentarily. “If that’s true, one 
of us could be the carrier.” 

“Very probably.” 

“Then your job is merely to 
find which one of us it is.” 

“I already know.” 

“Who?” This time Rauen 
could not conceal being startled. 

“That I’ll keep until later,” 
Kasper said. 

Rauen refused to be badgered 
into questioning further. “My 
congratulations.” He gave a sar- 

ALIEN'S BEQUEST 


donic half bow and left abruptly. 

This goading of Rauen was the 
act of a small man. I rose to leave 
also. 

“Charles,” Kasper stopped me. 
I paused and looked at him in- 
quiringly. 

“This isn’t what it seems to be. 
Take my word for it. And do me 
a favor. See — discreetly — that 
word of my knowledge gets out. 
Please.” 

I did as he asked. Even though 
I had no idea why he wanted it. 

I nadvertently I was in on the 
next act of the drama. I was 
unable to sleep that night and 
stepped into the corridor for a 
short walk. Thirty feet ahead of 
me I saw the cameraman, Leo 
Scanlon, just about to enter one 
of the other sleeping rooms. I 
came wide awake. 

He was entering Kasper’s 
room! 

I bounded swiftly forward, 
reaching Kasper’s door in time to 
see Scanlon, by the light from 
the hall, bending over Kasper’s 
bed. Even as I shouted a warning 
there was a scuffling and writh- 
ing of bed blankets, and both men 
crashed to the floor. 

For a moment I stood trying to 
make out who was who in the 
semidarkness. The intertwined 
figures struggled to their feet, and 
I could make out Scanlon with 
his hands clocked about Kasper’s 

183 


throat, slowly bending his head 
back. 

I sprang at Scanlon and 
grabbed him about the shoulders. 
He swung one arm against my 
chest and knocked me against the 
bedroom wall. I felt something 
snap and knew my own arm had 
been broken. I would be little 
more help here. 

However, through pain-filmed 
eyes I saw that I had given Kas- 
per a fleeting respite that he was 
using to good advantage. When 
Scanlon released the hand on his 
throat Kasper tucked his chin 
down against his chest, and in 
the same twisting movement 
drove his fist into the pit of Scan- 
lon’s stomach. 

Scanlon dropped like a bull 
receiving a dagger behind the 
horns — and the battle was over. 

Kasper’s trap — I recognized 
it as such now — had worked. 

r T''hat morning I visited the cell 
block where they had put 
Scanlon. I was refused admission 
by guards armed with flame 
throwers. Someone had recalled 
how the alien had been killed in 
the spaceship, but still not died. 
They were playing safe now. 

Kasper emerged from Scanlon’s 
cell block. “How is he?” I asked, 
turning to match strides with him 
as he walked. 

“Quiet. Apathetic almost,” 
Kasper answered. “A strange 

184 


thing though. He remembers 
nothing of what happened. He has 
no idea yet that the symbiote is 
inside him.” 

“Could he be faking?” 

“I wondered about that also, 
but a lie detector indicated other- 
wise.” 

We met Carole Schoppert. 
“How is he?” she repeated my 
earlier question. 

“As well as can be expected.” 
As they talked I reached into 
my shirt pocket for a cigarette. 
The sling on my broken arm made 
the simple movement awkward, 
and the package slipped from my 
grasp. Carole caught it in mid- 
air with a sure swift dart of one 
hand. 

She seemed to regard the act 
with no significance, but Kasper, 
I saw, was looking at her almost 
wide-eyed. He took her arm. “I 
would like to speak to you, Miss 
Schoppert.” 

T hat night Kasper and Carole 
left the base. They were 
going to be married, they an- 
nounced. 

The suddenness of it caught 
us by surprise. I had been busy 
during the day and seen them 
only once after the morning meet- 
ing. I had stopped at the lunch 
room in the bowling alley for a 
sandwich and coffee and seen 
Kasper and Carole there bowling. 
Carole was smiling and saying 


GALAXY 


something to Kasper in a teasing 
manner. Her smile always as- 
tounded me with the way it trans- 
formed her personality. In repose 
she was a sophisticated, almost 
elegant lady. When she smiled — 
her front teeth were slightly part- 
ed — she was a young, delighted 
girl. 

She was a much-alive indivi- 
dual, I reflected, the kind who 
evidently enjoyed being a woman. 
A man’s woman, my thoughts 
wandered on, and I wondered ab- 
stractedly if I was in love with 
her. 

Carole saw me watching them. 
“I’ve beaten him every game,” 
she called happily. 

I strolled over. “My low game 
was two hundred twenty-six,” 
Carole greeted me. “I’ve never 
bowled over two hundred before.” 

Kasper joined her in good-na- 
tured badinage, but he seemed 
less pleased than Carole. I left a 
short while later. 

That evening I heard they were 
to be married. 

C arole kissed me good-by. A 
lingering, moist-lipped buss- 
ing that raised my blood tempera- 
ture. I would have been flattered, 
except that nearly everyone who 
had come to see them off re- 
ceived much the same. I felt 
vaguely disquieted. Carole was a 
warm-blooded woman, but such 
enthusiasm bordered on bad 


taste. Which was not like her. 

The next morning near pan- 
demonium broke out on the base. 

I met Rauen coming from the 
laboratories. “Damn him. Damn 
him,” he was muttering. 

“What’s the trouble?” I asked. 

He motioned brusquely for me 
to come along. I had to stretch 
my legs to keep up with him. 

In his office Rauen put in an 
impatient call to the State De- 
partment. As he talked I learned 
quickly the reason for my dis- 
quiet earlier. My mind seemed 
divided into two parts as I listen- 
ed to the conversation; one part 
taking in what was being said, 
the other contemplating with an 
almost aghast disbelief the impli- 
cations of what I was hearing. 

“Could be a hundred, or a thou- 
sand, people infected by this 
time,” the first portion of my 
mind was registering disconnected 
words and phrases as Rauen 
talked. “Two means of transmis- 
sion ... a bodily takeover, such 
as Scanlon’s . infection by body 
fluid transmission ... a simple 
handshake ... or a kiss.” 

A kiss! The ground beneath 
my feet seemed to move a bit. 

Carole had done it to dozens 
of us. To me. 

To me! 

All very probably under Kas- 
per’s direction and with his con- 
nivance. I had the sick realiza- 
tion that it was already too late 

185 


ALIEN'S BEQUEST 


to repair the disaster. By now 
Carole and Kasper, with delibe- 
rate malice, had probably in- 
fected many others. With a kiss, 
or a moist handshake. And each 
victim became a carrier. To check 
the spread of the contagion 
would be impossible. Kasper 
would pass into history — if man- 
kind still had a future — as the 
world’s most infamous traitor. 

“You what?” I was brought 
back from my grim reflections by 
the change in Rauen’s tone. After 
a minute he hung up and turned 
toward me. “They’ve succeeded 
in translating some writing they 
found in the spaceship,” he said 
quietly. “A man is on the way 
now to give us what they found.” 
The man from the Capitol was 
tall and stooped, with horn- 
rimmed glasses and a flat-toned 
voice. “The translation became 
a simple matter,” he said, “once 
we discovered a paper that I can 
best describe as a ‘Rosetta, stone,’ 
prepared by the alien authorities 
to aid us. I’ll read you a bit from 
the beginning.” 

H is gaze went to the paper on 
the desk in front of him: 
"Greetings. May you receive 
our heroic envoy with the deep 
compassion and affection with 
which we bid him farewell. His 
journey will encompass many 
long, long i years. So long that he 
would not live to complete the 

186 


journey, except that he will keep 
his body in semi-catatonic stasis 
through the use of drugs. Our 
souls’ proud sorrow will accom- 
pany him as we envision his long 
periods of sedation, interrupted 
only by brief intervals of half- 
conscious reality, as he performs 
his duties, each time seeing him- 
self a bit older. Observing his 
muscles growing flaccid, his tis- 
sues losing their elasticity, per- 
haps even his mind becoming 
senile. We dan only hope he will 
retain sufficient mental vitality 
to manage a safe entry onto your 
world. Though even that should 
not matter greatly: His remain- 
ing time of life will be short — 
and even in death he should be 
able to complete his momentous 
mission. We pray for him, 1 and he 
will remain forever in our hearts." 

The Government man looked 
up. “Here we have a quotation 
much like, ‘Greater love has no 
man than that he give his life 
for another.’ ” 

, He removed his glasses. “As 
you have observed, they favor a 
quite flowery discourse. The next 
portion covers considerable space. 
To summarize, it seems they dis- 
covered that our world possesses 
intelligent life, probably through 
the use of instruments more so- 
phisticated than our own, but we 
were too far away for them to 
communicate.” 

He returned his glasses to read- 

GALAXY 



ing position. “Here are the last 
few paragraphs,” he said. 

“ Many eorns ago another bene- 
volent race, on another world, 
learned of our existence. To us 
they sent the Messos.” He paused 
again. “The Messos is the organ- 
ism we think of as a symbiote,” 
he explained. He continued: “It 
cured our illnesses and ' aberra- 
tions , mental and physical, and 
thus initiated the splendor of our 
present culture. In gratitude we 
resolved to do as much for any 
intelligent races we might dis- 


cover. 


“And so, from us to you, the 
gift. 

“ The Messos!’’ 


The Government man’s cough 
as he finished reading was the 
only sound in the room for sever- 
al minutes. From the side of my 
eye I caught the motion of the 
man next to me flexing one hand 
slowly, as he searched tentative- 
ly, wonderingly, for the gift with- 
in him.

ALIEN'S BEQUEST

by ALGIS BUDRYS 


rief Essay: 

It’s been two and a half 
years since I began expatiating 
on books in terms of money. The 
idea has been to serve primarily 
not as a critic, or even a review- 
er, but as an investment counsel- 
lor. It would be hard to recom- 
mend investments in stories — 
especially in bad but nevertheless 
rewarding ones — without as- 
suming some of the language of 
the critic. It would be impossible 
to do it without occasionally 
sounding like a reviewer. Conse- 
quently, I’ve been mistaken for 
both of the latter many times, 
and very rarely recognized as the 
former. 

Okay. Mutatis mutandis, like 
they say, which means if you 
can’t lick ’em, that’s your clue 
you’ll join ’em. Over the next few 
columns, you will see some 
changes made. Zip your pockets, 
unstick your holster flaps, and 
let’s go ravaging. 


Poul Anderson’s Ensign Flan- 
dry, Chilton ($4.50), is a pecu- 
liar book, full of good things, but 
a little shallow, and annoying if 
one wants it to be about the 
young Dominic Flandry. 

I think Anderson is now find- 
ing out what it feels like to be a 
C. S. Forester. Horatio Horn- 
blower, you may recall, actually 
began as the captain of H.M.S. 
frigate Lydia, but the press of 
popularity produced such subse- 
quent works as Lieutenant Horn- 
blower, Midshipman Hornblow- 
er, and, for all God knows, an 
aborted draft of Baby Hornblow- 
er and the Puddle Pirates. 

Ensign Dominic Flandry is 
here made a great deal like Mid- 
shipman Hernblower, which is 
bad to begin with. Hornblower 
was obviously a callow and tor- 
mented little boy until very late 
in life. Dominic Flandry could 
have sprung from no union less 
than that of Diana the Huntress 



188 


and David Niven, with all the 
early personality advantages one 
would derive from such a for- 
tune. 

Which is to say that this young 
Dominic Flandry, who fights the 
Seatrolls and the Merseians on 
behalf of the Terran Empire and 
the Tigeries of Starkad, must be 
some other Dominic Flandry, not 
the one whose adventures as a 
man full-grown were detailed in 
the two 1965 books, Agent oi the 
Terran Empire and Flandry oi 
Terra. 

Once we accept that orienta- 
tion, this is an enjoyable book; 
a, to coin a phrase, rattling good 
yarn of interstellar intrique, 
science, adventure, sex and com- 
passion for the human condition 
— and for the non-human crea- 
tures who share that condition. 

The plot does not require sum- 
marizing here, and would suffer 
from it; among the things that I 
particularly enjoyed in this book 
were all descriptions and narra- 
tive events having to do with the 
Tigeries; the description of life 
among the Seatrolls — to the 
point where I felt these were sad- 
ly skimpy — and the minor but 
important character of Dwyr the 
Hook. Among the things that 
shook me was Flandry’s remark 
to Persis d’lo upon the occasion 
of their first liaison. It is the only 
trace in the entire volume of 
what the real young Dominic 


Flandry might have said, and 
later looked back on with rue. 

Earthblood, the recent If se- 
rial by Keith Laumer and Rosel 
George Brown (Doubleday, 
$4.50) is a most amazing book. 

First of all, it’s a rather un- 
likely collaboration, until you 
stop to think of the precedent set 
by E. E. Smith and Lee Hawkins 
Garbey. Second, it reads more 
like a combined effort of Robert 
Heinlein and L. Ron Hubbard 
than anything else that ever 
walked the bookstores in the 
quiet hours of the night. 

Consider the plot: A human 
embryo of mysterious origin *is 
purchased by two outcast half- 
castes on a pauper world in the 
days well after the defeat of the 
Terran interstellar empire. Earth 
is a legend and space swarms 
with mutants and crossbreeds, 
the raggle-taggle of a hundred 
races loosely divided into Gooks 
— peoples with some scabrous 
claim to- human blood — and 
Geeks, those with none. The em 
bryo grows into Roan Cornay, 
the only pure-strain Terrie ever 
seen by any of the beings with 
which he comes in contact; a fig- 
ure of such exotic freakishness 
that it’s only a matter of time 
until he finds a place for himself 
in an interstellar zoo/carnival. 
Ever in search of his heritage and 
the legend of lost Terran gran- 


GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


189 


deur, he loves, befriends and loses 
scores of fascinating beings until 
finally he penetrates through 
space to old Earth, and there, as 
a result of his singleminded 
strength and the dream he 
arouses in the hearts of men, sets 
Earth back on the paths of glory. 
So far, we have Heinlein. 

Consider now, the cast of char- 
acters: Stellaraire, the crossbred 
carnival dancer; sterile, beauti- 
ful, commercial. She, captivated 
by the resourceful, deadly, hand- 
some, red-haired Roan, casts her 
lot with him, tends his wounds, 
teaches him what love is, is res- 
cued by him from the foul 
clutches of slimy non-humans, 
and ultimately dies when the zoo 
ship is bombarded by the cut- 
throat Captain Henry Dread. 

Consider Henry Dread, human 
spaceship commander, ostensible 
pirate and freebooter, actually 
Commander Dread of the Im- 
perial Terran Navy. 

Dread’s mission is to forage and 
finance, and to recruit Terries 
wherever he can find them; this 
against the day when the I. T. N. 
can once more rise, and, coalesc- 
ing from the scattered detach- 
ments left abandoned on the ga- 
lactic rim five thousand years 
earlier, return to Sol. There it 
will break the Niss blockade 
which for fifty centuries has held 
Earth captive and thus created 
the universal stalemate. 


Consider the stalemate, in 
which the other races and the re- 
mains of Man among the stars 
have found no common purpose 
and no peace. Instead, they 
brawl and struggle back and 
forth against each other, treat- 
ing the entire galaxy approxi- 
mately the same way that the 
natives of Marrakesch treat 
Marrakesch. 

Consider Iron Robert, the sili- 
coid being whom Roan and Stell- 
araire nurse from his gladiatorial 
combat with the fearsome chin- 
azell, when the carnival owner 
and even Iron Robert himself 
were willing to let Iron Robert 
lie in the dust and die. 

Consider Iron Robert’s undy- 
ing gratitude, and the manner 
in which ultimately he gives his 
life so that Roan may live, and 
escape Henry Dread’s explod- 
ing spacecraft, after Roan has 
shot Commander Dread — who 
not too long ago had sworn in 
Roan as Lieutenant Cornay of 
the I. T. N. 

And on, and on. Consider the 
faithful Askor and Sidis, the 
Gooks who follow Roan through 
all the incredible adventures 
along the long trail back to Earth 
and the degenerate aristocracy 
of Earth. Consider how they 
weep for each other when they 
are hurt. Consider the devotion 
of Sidis, who lops off his own 
left hand for Roan’s sake. If that

isn’t Hubbard, who is it? Lau- 
mer? Rosie Brown? 

Here is, friends, an Epic of 
the Spaceways if you ever saw 
one; a story to make one dream 
of Planet Stories. 

I used to think pastiche was 
something that occurred when a 
librarian sneezed. But, boys, this 
is the real stuff — the good old 
stuff — and I marvel, and I’m 
grateful, that someone has found 
the recipe for it again. Go get 
’em, gang! Encore! More gore! 

Less and less do I pick up each 
new Avram Davidson book with 
the hope that it will be even bet- 
ter than his Masters of The 
Maze. His latest, The Enemy of 
My Enemy, (Berkley) , begins 
well; in that beginning, it sounds 
like yet another excellent exam- 
ple of adventure writing. Jerred 
Northi, thief of Pemath Old Port, 
is a grade A swinger, a Francois 
Villon. 

So what happens? So he gets 
a new body, and goes to live 
among the upper classes, where 
he becomes Hamlet. Not Bill 
Shakespeare, roisterer of the 
Mermaid, master craftsman 
qualified to look the whole world 
in the eye and well aware of it, 
but Hamlet. And when Ophelia 
dies offstage, he goes “Aw, 
shucks — well, I should have 
known nothing good would come 
of it, sigh.” 


Hooey. During the last half 
of this book, which begins to 
read like first draft very soon 
after the ten thousand words 
that brought in the contract, 
Davidson is not only letting 
many crucial events occur off- 
stage, he is also jumping com- 
pletely over obligatory scenes 
which he apparently found too 
boring to write. Ultimately, he 
even stops weaving words and 
background matter with his nor- 
mally insuperable skill. Empty 
work by such as Davidson is at 
least as grindingly dull as work 
by empty people, and it grieves 
the heart sore. 

I don’t like reaching that kind 
of conclusion. Even less do I like 
writing it down. But there are 
some writers whose bad books 
you will read all the way 
through, because their names 
are associated with so much ad- 
miration and remembered pleas- 
ure. Then when you talk about 
the experience, a certain kind of 
outrage at the fickle nature of 
the muse conditions your choice 
of words.

stance; re. Why Call Them Back 
From Heaven?, (Doubleday,

of sf — and cried from love 
rather than envy. After I began 
doing it for money, they often 
made me consider that I would 
never learn half of what this 
man knows about the short story. 
Now it’s apparently time to rea- 
lize that, except for the case of 
Time and Again, (which as Time 
Quarry did more to give this 
magazine a roaring start than 
some of the short stories that 
ran concurrent with its install- 
ments), Simak’s strengths as a 
short story writer often expose 
weaknesses in what he does as 
a novelist. 

It’s only in a few scenes that 
this book lives. The plot — a 
simpleminded chase — occurs in 
a poorly-realized extrapolation 
of a world in which the object of 
power is the hundred million fa- 
tally injured people lying stored 
in frozen sleep. Despite this 
promising background, Simak 
has done nothing real; the cor- 
poration which has taken over 
the world, and is hunting the 
hero, uses it for an excuse. It 
acts like an overgrown advertis- 
ing or insurance agency, like a 
monstrous overgrowth of the le- 
gal profession, or like any of the 
other corporate villains of any 
of a score of sf novels. A man 
on the inside of the power struc- 
ture gets kicked out and hunted, 
for reasons he does not quite 
grasp, and despite his general 


belief in the mouth-noises the 
corporation makes to the world. 

Only when his fugitive is in 
contact with the world most real 
to his writer — the Wisconsin/ 
Minnesota countryside — is Si- 
mak writing anything. And he’s 
not writing anything he hasn’t 
written before. The rest of the 
time, while he’s consciously at 
work on his novel, he’s promul- 
gating hooey, and not as well as 
some others can do by instinct. 

Yes, Virginia, there is a double 
standard. When an established 
working sf writer produces a 
book, I do read it differently 
from the way I read something 
that’s been brought in from “out- 
side” — that is, originates from 
a byline I don’t recognize either 
as a previous contributor to the 
sf magazines or as a former ac- 
tive fan. The reason I’m this way 
is because I think most readers 
of these pages are the same. (The 
real reason I’m this way is be- 
cause I don’t believe any outsider 
knows what to do with science 
fiction; most of them use it the 
way slobs eat spaghetti, cutting 
it into bite-size pieces). 

The Scorpions by Robert 
Kelly, (Doubleday, $3.95), prob- 
ably doesn’t belong on Double- 
day’s science-fiction list at all, 
which is not to say it doesn’t be- 
long in this review column, be- 


192 


GALAXY 


cause it is science fiction. But it 
would have done much better 
on a major publisher’s general 
list, where it would have been 
properly received as a specimen 
of the anti-novel of manners. 

The science-fiction premise is 
kind of cute; a neurotic society 
woman partially convinces her 
manneristic society psychiatrist 
that there really is a race of 
ultraviolet people. 

This assertion is backed up by 
a few bits of physical evidence: 
Mostly, a series of cryptically 
worded cards sent to the psychia- 
trist by something called the 
Order, culminating in a cryptic 
invitation to the Order’s conven- 
tion — make that, perhaps, con- 
fabulation — in Fort Lauderdale, 
Florida. 

The world in which this very 
nearly unnamed psychiatrist 
lives is the superstitious modern 
world of the mobile rich. Kelly’s 
portrait of what goes on in these 
minds — the quirky belief in as- 
j trology as a mystique, the im- 
mense storehouse of thumb-rule 
ways to behave, so fully packed 
as to make the smooth flow of 
performance seem almost instinc- 
tive — these, together with the 
speech and action patterns of 
this sort of person, are beautiful- 
ly pictured. 

If we consider that he is con- 
tributing to the general body of 
science fiction, then the most im- 


portant thing Kelly is contribut- 
ing is genuine goods in an area 
where we poor middle-class ya- 
hoos normally fail. Most science- 
fiction writers describe the very 
rich and those who service them 
exactly as if they’d been study- 
ing Lord Plushbottom in the 
Chicago Tribune. 

This previous deficiency in the 
field is understandable. The very 
rich — the born very rich — know 
how to make themselves inacces- 
sible, and how to act upon the 
world along their own channels. 
Furthermore, because they know 
this is the way tire world really 
works, it’s very easy for them, 
(and even more easy for those 
who in servicing them have 
grown nouveau riche, and nou- 
veau engage), to suspect intelli- 
gent purpose from very skimpy 
patterns of clues indeed. 

This atmosphere — this atmos- 
phere of intrigue, excitement and 
resource-testing in an atmosphere 
of infinite resource — is the 
greatest charm of this book. Kel- 
ly, a career intellectual publish- 
ing his first novel, has done an 
immensely skillful job of super- 
imposing the possible intrigues 
and potential menaces of the 
“Scorpion people” on this real 
and rather rare background. Be- 
cause his protagonist sees pat- 
terns where you and I would see ' 
nearly nothing, and acts pur- 
posefully where you and I would 

193 


GALAXY BOOKSHELF 


still be wondering what the hell 
was coming off — if anything at 
all were coming off — we are car- 
ried along very nicely, and subt- 
ly, while Kelly piles into this 
wordage a great deal of arcane 
jazz about astrology, memorized 
scholarship and all those other 
articles of virtu. Scattered 
throughout the book are tags of 
philosophical expression in a var- 
iety of languages, which all bear 
on the protagonist’s problem as 
he wends his way southward in 
Kelvin, an automatic Rolls 
Royce offering all the comforts 
of a womb that’s been to finish- 
ing school. 

This pilgrimage becomes rem- 
iniscent of the compulsive won- 
derings of J. G. Ballard’s charac- 
ters, just as the string of clues 
whereby the hero is ultimately 
attracted to his destruction, at 
the hands of the ur-teenybod, is 
extremely reminiscent of Father 
Brown (the jacket copy says 
Sherlock Holmes, but Kelly is 
is much smarter than to use 
that). 

We never do find out for sure 
just what it is that the protagon- 


ist finally finds as he pursues his 
journey to its end, at the acceler- 
ating cost of his most precious 
self-protective mannerisms. He is 
definitely being lured, stripped 
and at last rebuilt — perhaps be- 
ing obliterated. 

Whether he is being lured by 
ultraviolet people or the per- 
fectly visible and rational inhab- 
itants of the unknown island, 
Eos, we don’t know. But this 
book does describe, in cunning 
detail, how a race of ultrahuman 
beings could prey with complete 
effectiveness on the only kind of 
human being effectively invul- 
nerable to the gross forms of 
attack. 

Oversimplifying it, the hero’s 
impregnability rests on the 
schooling he has given his self. 
Unfortunately, the closer he gets 
to the end of the book, the less 
of his personality he has, and so, 
seemingly, the less the writer’s 
ability to continue wrapping his 
reader in the very stuff of the 
only dream of Heaven and hell 
that you and I can really believe 
in.
