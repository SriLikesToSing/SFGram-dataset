1%/T OVIES and TV were fore- 
seen by science fiction long 
before they came about. The 
crystal ball went cockeyed, how- 
ever, when it squinted at the enter- 
tainment; its swirling draperies 
and heavenly music would net a 
.0001 Trendex in this Year of the 
Horse: horse opera, horse laughs, 
horse play, and other equine at- 
tributes. 

Pinpointing any device is the 
easier part of extrapolation. Antic- 
ipating effects is a lot harder, and 
still more so for the Utopians who 
mainly wrote our early science fic- 
tion; they had the most innocent 
notions of how things were to be 
manufactured and distributed, and 
especially why. 

Whirling draperies and heaven- 
ly music may be fine for a first 
viewing of TV or movies — any- 
thing would be — just as Times 
Square struck G. K. Chesterton as 
an awesome sight for someone 
who can’t read, which is much like 
the “sense of wonder” sought by 
paleolithic fans who got trapped in 
the lowest strata of science fiction. 
For people eventually learn to 
read, to grow selective, to pay less 
attention to a wondrous gizmo 
than what it’s meant for. 

And so the reality behind each 
change is a sort of reversal : “Good 
greshams drive out the bad,” a 


gresham in this instance being a 
handy unit of desirability based on 
how severely what’s new clob- 
bers what’s old — and how smart- 
ly and trickily what’s old fights 
back. 

Once radio showed how shows 
could be financed, the shape of TV 
was cast, or at least extruded. Add 
the stuff that movies are made on 
and you have form and content. 
With one free and the other not, 
the sound of war was inevitable to 
anybody with a good ear for 
greshams, even if the actual tac- 
tics and weapons stayed invisible. 
At this short distance, those and 
the principal battlefields show up 
on the picture of the future: 

Unless its heads display sudden 
and unlikely braininess, pay TV 
is no challenger. Its ad-free pro- 
grams are not recoilless when the 
viewer faces the charge at month’s 
end. 

As long as it’s free, commercial 
TV doesn’t have to get better. 
Even if it gets worse, a “What 
if—?” that dismays the sturdiest 
extrapolative mind, its prisoners 
can’t break out of the living room 
stockade without spending money. 

This particular skirmish is won 
by the entertainment generals with 
the biggest greshams: the movies. 
There are two hows of it, as dia-

All this at no increase in price — a hard-headed bet 
that upgrading pays off in these days of less and less 
for more and more.

metric as guerrilla and pentomic 
warfare. 

Time wrote up one hero of the 
guerrilla attack: Kansas City’s El- 
mer C. Rhoden, Jr., 35, president 
of Commonwealth Theaters, a 
chain of 102 film houses. Rhoden 
says TV is for the older folks; 
teen-agers on a date don’t want to 
stay home. He pulls in the young- 
sters with rock-’n’-roll-’ems like 
The Delinquents and The Cool 
and the Crazy, made last year for 
$171,000. Rhoden will produce 
Daddy-O and Sideburns and Sym- 
pathy this year. 

The opposite of these snipers 
are the wraparound CosmicScopic, 
StentorPhonic gigantacles, the cost 
of each greater than any single 
theater — The Ten Command- 
ments, for instance, at a megabuck 
per Commandment. Like Niagara 
Falls, they can’t be invited to the 
home; they have to be traveled to, 
which is the how-come rather than 
know-how behind their vast budg- 
ets. 

It is inevitable that Generalis- 
simo of all the Cinemarmies should 
be Cecil B. de Mille, whose fifty 
years of geophysical biblicalum- 
nies put him half a century ahead 
of his film foes — and ever out of 
the ken of TV’s creepie-peepie 
cameras. 

When the current pictures are 
released to television, can you 
imagine the Flight from Egypt on 

4 


your home screen? Marching ciga- 
rettes, it will seem, one opened 
carton pursuing another through 
a cloven bowl of Jell-o. 

TV screens can get larger, of 
course, can even become theaters- 
in-the-round like today’s movie 
houses, an entire room bowed out 
and windowless — but is that a 
gresham to bet on with homes and 
apartments growing smaller? 

No, the fields and forces are in 
focus now: 

TV, bigger but limited in size, 
with color to come, manned by the 
kids and old folks. 

The dim caves of dragstrip riots 
and mug monsters, hidden out in 
by teen-agers on dates. 

The Grand Canyon palaces, fea- 
turing worlds in collision, nations 
on the move, skyscraper (as op- 
posed to mug) monsters, visual 
tons of flesh loving or hating each 
other — pincering families on out- 
ings. 

It’s the particular misfortune of 
science fiction to have become 
cinematic vogue just when the 
chips came down. Only its most 
primitive themes, dripping horrors 
and astronomical catastrophes, fit 
the cave and canyon screens. TV 
could do the good modem stories; 
there’s even a chance it may. 

That great big Asteroid Belt up 
there — was it caused by a long- 
ago Mike Todd’s attempt to outdo 
a de Mille?

I N reading this report, it must 
be borne in mind that when 
the word “they” is used, it 
does not refer necessarily to sepa-

It is possible that a closer analo-

pack or forming a mob. 

On the other hand, that particu-

centricity — and will hereinafter be 
referred to as “she.” This is be- 
cause “she” invariably assumed a 
female form when visiting us, and 
because she furthermore gave 
every indication of that type of 
mind and point of view which is 
generally met with in the more no- 
ticeable, effective or contentious 
members of that sex. 

As she put it herself during the 
hearing, she was always in hot 
water. 

* * * 

THE FOUR teen-agers — one girl, 
three boys — weren’t allowed in 
the bar, so they went down the 
street to a joint where there were 
a soda fountain, booths and a juke- 
box. They sat in a booth and a 
waitress came to take the orders: 
three hot dogs and three cokes. 
“What about you, dear?” 

“Just a glass of water.” The 
waitress started to leave. “No, 
wait — gimme a white on rye, too.” 
The waitress left, then came 
back again. “What was that you 
wanted, dear? Some kind of rye- 
bread sandwich?” 

“Changed my mind. Make it a 
buttered pecan, but tell ’em to go 
easy on the butter. And I don’t 
want no French dressing. Make it 
on whole wheat.” 

r I ’HE waitress looked uncertain. 

“You mean a nut sandwich?” 
“Yeah, only malted. With let- 
tuce and chocolate sprinkles.”

“Who you kiddin’?” the wait- 
ress said, and turned to go. 

“No, hold it. Tell Joe to please 
scramble them on both sides.” 
“What you talkin’ about?” the 
waitress said. “We ain’t got no one 
here called Joe.” 

“So okay, Joseph, then. Tell him 
just a boiled egg sunny side up.” 
The waitress left, frowning. 
“Our Miss Framis,” one of the 
boys said, meaning the girl, and 
the others smiled. They looked as 
though they were sneering at the 
same time and hoped they would 
be taken for juvenile delinquents. 

There were two very odd-look- 
ing men in the booth opposite and 
they were listening to the conver- 
sation. Their oddness lay in an at- 
mosphere rather than in any physi- 
cal abnormality. The girl noticed 
them and nudged one of the boys. 

The three boys looked at the 
men resentfully and one of them 
said something under his breath, 
but the girl said, “Button it.” Then 
she asked the men opposite, 
“Lookin’ for someone, mister?” 
The two men looked away, and 
this made the boys feel brave. One 
of them said, “Let’s give ’em the 
works.” 

“No, leave it to me.” The girl 
got up and went across to the two 
men. “Me and my friends was 
wondering. Maybe you gentlemen 
would like to come to a trake in 
the gort later?” 

The three boys snickered and 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


the men looked up at the girl and 
waited with blank faces. 

“Or maybe you’d rather we put 
on a hanse for you?” she said. 

“No, sit down,” one of the men 
— the bigger one — said, and 
moved back to make room for 
her. She glanced at him with sur- 
prise for a moment and sat down 
next to him. 

One of the boys started to get 
up when he saw this, but the 
others pulled him down again. 

“What did you say to us just 
now?” the big man asked. “It was 
too small in here.” 

She shook her head and frowned. 
“Why, that was just ... I said did 
you want for us to put on a hanse, 
is all.” She had a rather feeble 
grin. 

“Yes,” the big man said. “We 
do.” 

She glanced back at her friends 
nervously, and then at the man 
again. “I don’t get you,” she said. 

“Neither do we,” the smaller 
man said. 

The boys across the room were 
listening quietly and then one of 
them said, “Go on, tell ’em, Miss 
Framis.” 

“We just want you to quint,” 
the big man said, “and won’t thurs- 
day on it.” 

She stared at him without ex- 
pression and got up slowly. She 
went over to her friends. “Let’s 
get out of here,” she said. 

She was shivering. 


Q You say you object to this 
line of questioning? 

A. (She) No, I just don’t like 
being spied on. And it made 
the kids . mad. They 
wrecked the car and that meant 
starting all over again. 

Q. The car? 

A. Yes, their hot-rod. When we 
got outside, they acted the way 
teen-agers do and went too 
fast. They were sore at those 
spies — they took it out on the 
car, so it went off the road. It 
turned over three times and 
we were all killed. 

Q. They were not spies. They 
were acting on their own. 

A. I didn’t know that. I just knew 
something was funny. Anyway, 
how can you say that? They’re 
a waste. And it would have 
been part of you, just as I am. 
It was more of a waste if I 
hadn’t been split. The other 
part was only about eleven 
years old and I had to wait 
another six years to — 

Q. It is your own fault if you 
were split. You cannot blame 
us. This has happened before— 
you have aimed badly and ar- 
rived wrong. Don’t forget about 
the help. 

A. Well, in this case it’s a lucky 
thing I did; otherwise the 
whole thing would have been 
wasted. And the kelp— that was 
dreadfully dull. I wanted to 
try a really primitive form, but 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


9 


not that primitive. Then I got 
washed up and it led to the cat. 
After they got the iodine out of 
the kelp, I was suddenly a cat. 

Q. This has not been reported. 

A. I’m reporting it now. It wasn’t 
dull in the least, but they were 
very superstitious about cats in 
those days, and they decided I 
was possessed. 

Q. They saw through you? 

A. Oh, yes. People usually do. 

Q. You couldn’t have been very 
successful if they saw through 
you. 

A. It doesn’t make any difference 
if they see through you. The 
important thing is to see 
through them. 

Q. But you were a cat. 

A. Cats are in a very good posi- 
tion to see through people. I 
think they sensed that. Any- 
way, I was . done away with. 

Q. Burned again? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Seems to be a habit of yours. 
What happens? How does it 
feel? 

A. I cannot explain it to you, but 
I know what to do. It’s not my 
habit — it’s one of theirs, but 
it’s dying out in most places 
now. And there was a time 
when it would never have oc- 
curred to them. They were too 
frightened of it. 

Q. Frightened of what? 

A. Of fire. It was very new 
then . 


T HE hunters came back to the 
cave at dusk, and one of them 
went to the fire that was kept go- 
ing constantly in front of the open- 
ing. He took a dry branch and 
held it in the fire until the end 
caught. Then he held it up. “If we 
take this, we can hunt in the dark,” 
he said. “And when it is nearly 
eaten by the fire, we can take an- 
other branch and start it again. 
That way we do not need the 
moon.” 

“That way we can hunt until we 
are tired,” said the other. 

“That way we can kill twice as 
much game,” said the first 

“There is so much game in the 
cave now,” a young woman said, 
“that it is beginning to smell.” 

The older hunter glanced at her 
apprehensively; she made him feel 
foolish, always finding fault with 
his plans. “Perhaps so,” he said. 
“But at other times we starve.” 
“Besides,” she said, “if you take 
the fire with you to see where you 
are going and to see the game, the 
game will see you.” 

The hunters looked at one an- 
other and shrugged. The woman 
went into the cave and returned 
with an earthenware pot. There 
were pieces of raw meat and some 
water in it, and she put it on the 
fire, propping it in position with 
three stones. The second hunter 
looked at the pot curiously. He was 
a younger brother from the other 
side of the valley, where he lived 


10 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


with his mates. He pointed at the 
pot and looked inquiringly at the 
older brother. 

“She made it out of mud,” the 
older brother said. 

“Why doesn’t it fall apart with 
the water in it?” 

“I put it into the fire first, for a 
long time,” the young woman said. 
“A very big fire. The mud gets 
red — and then it gets hard so it 
won’t melt when the water is in 
it” 

The younger man looked sur- 
prised. “Magic?” 

“Yes,” said the other man. 

“Nonsense,” said the woman. 
She went back to the cave and the 
young man put the end of his spear 
into the fire and tried to scrape 
the side of the pot with the flint 
head, but the flint was cold and it 
cracked. He pulled it back and was 
looking angrily at it when she 
came out again and sat on the 
ground. She had an armful of 
roots which she began to scrape 
with a sharp stone. “The spear- 
head is made of the wrong sort of 
stone,” she said, without looking 
up. “That is why it broke in the 
fire.” 

“It’s made of the right kind!” 
the young man shouted. “All spear- 
heads are made of that kind! They 
always have been and they always 
will be! How did you know it 
broke in the fire? You weren’t 
looking.” 

“I heard it make the sound it 


makes when the fire breaks it” 
The young man glowered and 
pushed his under lip out. “This 
kind of stone was put in the cave 
for us to make knives and spears. 
And it makes a very sharp edge 
when you know how to form it.” 
“No sharper than this knife,” she 
said, holding up the stone in her 
hand. “This doesn’t break so 
easily.” 

The young man took it and 
examined it carefully. “How do 
you strike it to make it this 
shape?” he said, and then, grudg- 
ingly, “It is very smooth — a very 
good shape.” 

“You don’t strike it,” she said, 
taking it back and going on scrap- 
ing the roots. “You rub it on an- 
other stone — first on the kind that 
has the bright sparkles in it, and 
then under water on the flat gray 
kind. It’s much better than your 
knives and the fire doesn’t break 
it so easily.” 

^IHE finished with the roots and 
^ put them in the pot with the 
meat. 

“Where do you find such big 
roots?” the young man asked his 
brother. 

“Over there,” the brother said, 
pointing to a patch of earth near- 
by. “She finds them there.” 

“I don’t find them,” she said. 
“I put them there in the first place.” 
“You mean you store them in 
the earth?” the young man said. 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


11 


“No. I put the tops in the ground 
— the blue and yellow flowers — 
and next warm season I dig and 
there are the new roots. You have 
to put water on the earth when it 
gets dry. Also you have to pull 
up all the small plants that grow 
there among them. It’s very hard 
work.” 

“More magic,” said the young 
man. 

“It’s not magic!” she said. “You 
are stupid. Haven’t you noticed 
that when you leave an acorn on 
the ground, it breaks open and a 
finger goes down into the earth? 
And then, after the next rains, it 
makes little leaves — and if you 
leave it alone, it grows and in time 
becomes a young tree?” 

“Everyone knows that,” the 
young man said disdainfully. 

“Well, this is the same.” 

“Yes, but what makes the roots 
so big? I never saw any like these.” 

“That’s because I only take the 
flowers from the plants that have 
the biggest roots. And if any of 
the new roots are little, I throw 
away the flowers from them. Far 
away.” 

“What do you do with the little 
roots?” 

“Eat them.” 

“I don’t understand. If you eat 
the little roots, why don’t you get 
little roots?” 

“You are being foolish again!” 
the young woman said. “A tall man 
has tall sons.” 


“If he eats the meat of a tall 
animal,” said the young man. 

“That has nothing to do with it.” 
“My friend’s father, who lives 
near the river, always eats the fat 
of the game they kill, and he is 
fat. So you see!” 

“That has nothing to do with 
it,” she said, and went into the 
cave. 

The young man walked up and 
down angrily. “Why does she talk 
that way? Is she one of our sis- 
ters? I don’t remember her.” 

“No," said the other. “She was 
with the people we fought with 
three seasons ago. She is my new 
mate and she is very good at 
magic, only I advise you not to pay 
any attention to what she says.” 
The other picked up the scrap- 
ing-stone she had left and looked 
at it with grudging envy. “The very 
tall man who killed the aurochs 
by himself has a son,” he said, 
“and the son is short.” 

The other shrugged. “Don’t pay 
any attention to her.” 

The woman came out again and 
looked at the sky, then went to 
the fire and stirred the pot with a 
stick. “I wish you would try to get 
the young animals,” she said. “You 
always bring home the biggest ones ' 
and they are hard to chew unless 
I cook the meat all day.” 

“My father said that if you wish 
to be brave, powerful and swift, 
you must eat only the animals 
that are brave, powerful and swift,” 


12 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


said the young man obstinately. 

“Didn’t he eat roots, too?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, then.” 

The young man threw the scrap- 
ing-stone hard against the side of 
the cave opening and split it in 
two. “Roots are not animals!” 

r |''HE young woman picked up 
the pieces and said, “I think 
I can make a small scraper out of 
the big piece and a throwing tip 
out of the little one, but this is a 
foolish way to get little stones. 
There are more little ones than 
big ones.” 

“Show him your bent stick with 
the animal sinew,” said her mate. 
“She has a way of throwing very 
stnall spears with a bent stick,” 
he said to his brother. He had a 
dim feeling that there should be 
peace between the other two, since 
they were near his cave, but he 
was scarcely aware of the feeling. 

The young woman looked 
pleased and went into the cave and 
brought back a stick of springy 
wood with a thong attached to one 
end, and a few dried reeds. 

“See,” she said, and took a dried 
reed which had a small sharp stone 
stuck in the end of it Then she 
bent the stick and strung the sinew 
from end to end. The younger man 
had his first view of a bow and 
arrow. “This was the way my 
mother showed me to throw little 
spears.” 


She fitted the arrow into the 
bow and, pulling it back, shot it 
at a pine tree on the other side of 
the fire. The bowstring twanged 
and the arrow wobbled, having no 
fletching, but it stuck into the tree 
trunk. The young man jumped 
back in alarm and blinked his 
eyes. Then he went to the tree 
and pulled at the arrow. It came 
loose, leaving the tip stuck in the 
bark. 

“What good is it?” he said de- 
risively, to conceal his astonish- 
ment “It is a child’s plaything!” 
He tried to pry out the arrowhead 
with his thumb, and broke his nail. 

“If any child of mine played 
with this,” said the young woman, 
“I should beat him.” She put a 
larger arrow into the bow — one 
that had a heavier tip — and shot 
it into the same tree. Owing to its 
superior balance, this arrow did not 
wobble; it swished through the air 
and sank its tip deep into the soft 
wood. 

“You have no child,” said her 
mate, “so how can you beat it?” 

The young woman said nothing, 
but she looked angry. 

“My other women have chil- 
dren,” he went on tauntingly. 
“They laugh at you.” 

“You have no child younger 
than ten seasons!” she said, and 
stamped her foot. “That is why I 
have no child! You are an old 
man!” 

He started toward her with a 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS

look of furious intention. He had 
no spear in his hand, but he held 
a club with flint splinters stuck in 
the heavy head. She ran back to 
the cave mouth and put another 
arrow in her bow and aimed it at 
him. They both stood silently star- 
ing at one another. Then he threw 
down his club and turned away. 

“Peace,” he said. 

“Peace,” she replied, and dropped 
her bow. She went to the pot over 
the fire and sniffed it, poking at the 
meat with a sharp stick. “The food 
is ready,” she said. “Will you take 
the pot off the fire? You have 
braver hands than I.” 

How are we to find out any- 
thing about them, when you 
are so slow? 

A. What are we supposed to find 
out? 

Q. That is what you are supposed 
to find out. 

A. I am to find out what I am to 
find out? You sound like them 
—like men. 

Q. Like Man? 

A. No, men. The women aren’t 
quite the same. That’s why I 
always choose to be one, but I 
wish you would send somebody 
else — another part of our Or- 
ganism. I’m tired. 

Q. Absurd. Besides, you are the 
best; you cannot be tired. 

A. The best! How am I the best? 
You do nothing but criticize. 
You send me because I under- 



stand the intentions — the lean- 
ings — of live things. You say 
I understand understanding. I 
suppose that makes me some 
kind of epistemologist: the 

father confessor of the in- 
scrutable. 

Q. Wouldn’t it be mother confes- 
sor? 

A. Not with them; they don’t like 
women to be priests. They can 
be holy, but they don’t like 
women to tell them what to do. 
It’s called nagging. They get 
especially angry if the woman 
is right. 

Q. Hmm. Now you say that we 
criticize you. You surely are 
not going to claim to be above 
criticism here, are you? 

A. Oh, no. I’m beneath it. 

Q. Then why do you resent it? 

A. Because it doesn’t apply. If a 
mother is not a fool, she will 
correct her child, but she won’t 
blame it. You can’t go looking 
for good and evil motives in 
everything that happens. Does 
a stone have a motive when 
it falls to the ground? 

Q. If this is the way you always 
talked, I’m not surprised you 
angered them. 

A. I am sorry. 

Q. You turn everything around 
that’s said to you. 

A. I will try not to. It’s like the 
bishop — he complained about 
the same thing, and I was only 
trying to — 


14 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


Q. What bishop? 

A. I forgot his name. He was the 
thin one; he was much cleverer 
than the others. He gave me an 
impossible choice, so I chose 
to make another start. 

Q. You mean you got yourself 
burned again? 

A. Yes! They did it to all their 
best people. Both sides did. I 
would have looked a precious 
fool if I’d backed down. 

Q. Can’t you bear to admit you 
are wrong? 

A. But I wasn’t wrong. Anyway, 
they’d have made me out in the 
wrong either way. 

Q. Did they only burn the wo- 
men, when they thought the 
women were wrong? 

A. No, of course not. And it was 
usually when they suspected 
the women were right Then 
there were the women who 
were thought to be possessed 
by what they thought were evil 
spirits. 

Q. They didn’t suspect they were 
right, surely? 

A. No, but they were afraid they 
might be. They were very un- 
sure of themselves and their 
beliefs. That’s when they 
burned people. 

Q. It sounds very wasteful. They 
must be very careless of their 
possessions. 

A. No, not in the least I’ll ex- 
plain — 

Q. I wish you wouldn’t. 


A. There, you see? They were 
just like you — they kept ask- 
ing me questions and getting 
more and more enraged when 
I answered them. So, to shut 
me up, they tied me to a stake. 
Q. You are too interested in your 
own reactions to things. Tell 
us about something more con- 
structive — about what you 
found in other guises. I under- 
stand you led an insurrection? 
A. If you call throwing an armed 
robber out of your house an 
insurrection. The trouble was 
that on that occasion a lot of 
my friends thought I was right. 
That’s called conspiracy . 

* | '’HE captain led a small group 
-*■ of foot-soldiers into the vil- 
lage at what, to the Romans, was 
the Twelfth Hour, which is sun- 
set. The soldiers had light armor 
and carried only the small shields 
— not the enormous testudines — 
but they had been warned to keep 
their eyes open as the British were 
tricky, even treacherous. The cap- 
tain greatly disliked to take such 
raw troops so far north, where the 
treaties were uncertain and the 
Pax Romana was held lightly, if 
at all. An ancestor of his, also a 
captain, had been killed near here 
in one of Hadrian’s marches, and 
no one was quite sure what had 
happened. 

The earth wall that Hadrian’s 
men subsequently built across the 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


15 


British island was intended to keep 
out the more unruly natives of the 
North, and later the emperor 
Severus built another one of stone, 
but it was by now in a state of 
disrepair and only a few of the 
guard towers were manned. Even 
the Great North Road made an 
attenuated and unreliable line of 
supply, and the captain could ex- 
pect neither reinforcements nor 
food from the camps further south, 
like Eboracum or Lancastrium. 

Live off the land, he was told, 
and that meant quartering his 
troops — a risky thing because it 
separated them — or sending forag- 
ing parties to the surly farmers for 
“contributions.” Since he was here 
to collect back-taxes, the inhabit- 
ants would not take kindly to 
feeding the collectors. 

The village had a stockade of 
undressed logs and wide gates at 
either end. These were surmounted 
by arched wooden structures that 
were supposed to serve as watch- 
towers, but beyond spears and 
knives for hunting and the neces- 
sary farming implements, the vil- 
lagers were not allowed to carry 
weapons of any kind. The stockade 
was not big enough to enclose all 
the houses, and the majority of 
these were on the outside and hud- 
dled against the walls. 

The small body of Roman 
troops — barely a manipulus — 
were not surprised to notice that 
all the windows and booths had 


been shuttered, and in the exact 
center of the village, the local 
chieftain and heads of families 
were gathered in a respectful and 
anxious group. It annoyed the 
captain that it was impossible to 
make an unexpected arrival any- 
where in Britain; news traveled 
faster than Roman foot-soldiers. 

“Hail Caesar!” said the captain, 
putting his arm up, the palm of 
his hand facing forward. 

“Hail Caesar!” said the vil- 
lagers. 

“We come for the taxes which 
were not paid last year.” 

The villagers shook their heads 
and made regretful sounds. 

“Nor the year before, nor the 
year before that Which is your 
headman? I shall require food for 
my men at once — they are tired 
after a day’s march.” 

A gray-bearded, very tall man 
stood forward. “The food will be 
ready at once, noble decemvir, and 
I hope you will honor me with 
your presence for dinner.” 

“Thank you very much,” said 
the captain, “but I prefer to stay 
with my men until I see them 
taken care of. And I am not a 
decemvir. My rank is captain — 
Caesar’s captain.” 

The bearded man bowed and 
said, “Then, after the arrange- 
ments have been made, Captain, 
will you not take a cup of wine?” 
“Don’t press him, Grandfather,” 
a voice said from above them, and, 


16 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


looking up, the captain saw a girl’s 
face at a second-story window. 
She had very dark skin, red hair 
and blue eyes. “If he’s been walk- 
ing all day, I expect he wants to 
go to bed early. You’ll only keep 
him up all night talking about 
boar hunts.” 

“Silence!” the headman shouted. 
“Get back, girl! You insult our . 
our guest!” 

“No, let her stay,” the captain 
said with an amused smile. “Bet- 
ter still, have her come down. I 
think I shall accept your offer 
about the wine later.” 

TN the evening, the captain came 
to the headman’s house with 
his two lieutenants as guard. They 
were received with deference and 
given wolf-hides to sit on. The 
wine was brought by the grand- 
daughter and served in horn cups. 

“What is your name, young 
lady?” asked the captain politely. 
“This is excellent wine, by the 
way.” 

“Thank you, Captain,” she said. 
“We have had a cask taken to your 
men. I made it myself, three years 
ago. My name is Boadicea.” 

“Boadicea?” said the captain in 
astonishment. 

“No, no, Captain!” the headman 
said hurriedly. “She’s joking — her 
name is Flavia; the other is the 
name she takes for herself. I ap- 
pologize for her.” 

“It is not a joke,” she said. 


“Boadicea is my heroine and I 
have taken her name. I don’t like 
the name Flavia — it’s Roman. Do 
I look like a Roman to you, Cap- 
tain?” 

“You look very beautiful,” the 
captain said, laughing, “and there 
is no need for apology. I admire 
Boadicea myself; she very nearly 
drove Caesar’s men into the sea. It 
was a long time ago.” He drained 
his wine cup. “A long, long time 
ago.” 

“But we have not forgotten her, 
Captain,” the girl said, filling his 
cup again. 

“You insult our honored guest, 
girl!” her grandfather said. “Go to 
bed!” 

“No, I beg you — please don’t 
send her to bed,” said the captain. 
“I’m not in the least insulted. Af- 
ter all, it’s ancient history now. 
I don’t think people think of us as 
conquerors any more. We are pro- 
tectors. While we are here, the 
Piets stay where they belong, and 
the Scots, too.” 

“The Piets say they used to live 
hereabouts,” said the girl. 

“The Piets say, the Piets say! 
What do you know of what they 
say?” asked her grandfather. 

“The cook’s mother is a Piet,” 
she replied. 

“Well, she’d better not come 
here!” said the headman. “We want 
no Celts!” 

“But, Grandfather, we are 
Celts!”

“No, girl, we are Romans,” he 
answered, looking sideways at the 
captain. 

The captain nodded. “That is 
true. All members of the Empire 
are Romans. Not citizens, perhaps, 
but Romans just the same, and all 
live by Caesar’s law.” 

“But suppose people don’t want 
to live by his law?” said the girl. 

The two lieutenants looked 
shocked, but the captain smiled. 
“That would be most foolish and 
uncivilized of them. Don’t you 
think it’s better for the whole 
world to live as members of one 
community and cease all this use- 
less warfare?” 

“It seems to me,” the girl said, 
“that warfare is the result of some- 
body trying to take somebody 
else’s land and subject him to a law 
that is alien to him.” 

T HE captain raised his eyebrows 
and put his head to one side 
quizzically. The headman coughed 
and attempted to change the sub- 
ject. “The taxes, Captain,” he said, 
“are very much on my mind . 

“And on mine,” the captain said. 
The two lieutenants tried to look 
businesslike, but they looked more 
as if they were falling asleep. 

“And I hope I may say that this 
time we will have them ready for 
you,” said the headman. 

“I hope so, too,” said the captain. 
"But there are other levies that 
have not been made, which we had 


rather expected to be made . 

“Other levies?” The captain held 
out his cup and the girl poured 
more wine into it. 

“I refer to troops, Captain,” the 
headman said. “You levy no troops 
from us up here.” 

“You put me in rather an em- 
barrassing position,” the captain 
said. “You must realize that while 
I make no comparison to yourself, 
there are some people living at the 
outer boundaries of the Empire, 
people not yet wholly reconciled 
to Caesar’s dominion, people who 
— to give another example — think 
of themselves as, say, Helvetiae 
first and Romans second. It is the 
Imperial policy in such cases not 
to levy troops because—” 

“In other words,” the girl inter- 
rupted, “you think we are not to 
be trusted. It quite passes my un- 
derstanding why anyone should 
expect loyalty unless it is freely 
offered.” 

“But, my dear young lady, you 
are not slaves! You are given the 
civilizing benefits of Roman rule, 
and you are taxed very much less 
than people living in Rome itself, 
I can assure you of that.” He felt 
terribly sleepy — the wine was 
stornger than he had thought and 
he found it difficult to think of the 
right words. He was beginning to 
sound to himself like a senator, a 
race of men he secretly despised. 
“Let me put it this way,” he went 
on. “A child does not offer loyalty 


18 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


to his parents— it comes by nature.” 

“Perhaps grown people do not 
like to be treated as children,” she 
said. “I don’t.” 

“You behave like one, Grand- 
daughter!” the headman said. “Go 
to your room!” 

Rather unexpectedly, she got up 
and walked to the door. “Good 
night, Captain,” she said, but he 
did not answer. He was asleep and 
so were his lieutenants, and, since 
there were poppyheads in the wine, 
they did not wake up even when, 
an hour later, the shouting began 
outside. 

A LMOST the entire detachment 
■**- of the Roman troops was 
killed, and the captain and his lieu- 
tenants were being held hostage 
by the Pictish Decaledonae who 
had swarmed over the broken Wall 
— the break having been enlarged 
by the headman’s granddaughter 
and her friends during the previ- 
ous night. 

The headman and his com- 
panions were horrified; they 
pleaded with the Pictish leaders to 
spare the Roman officers. “Caesar 
will send a legion,” the headman 
said, “many legions to avenge this! 
Leave them unharmed and go 
back to the North, and the Roman 
captain will soften the blow that 
will fall on us all . .” 

The Piets told him to shut up 
and called for wine. The headman 
and his companions took advan- 


tage of the carousing to slip out 
the back way and, taking some of 
the villagers, including Flavia, they 
hid themselves in a cottage in the 
forest. Except for the girl, they 
were shaking with terror. She was 
triumphant. 

“Now Caesar will withdraw 
again,” she said. “He no longer 
moves north — but slowly south- 
ward. The next Imperial rampart 
will be below us, and we shall be 
free!” 

“You are mad,” her grandfather 
said. “Under Roman rule, we are 
safe. What can we expect from 
these Pictish barbarians?” He 
looked at her as though she were 
some new kind of snake. 

“I should rather be occasionally 
robbed by my cousins than taxed 
to death by strangers,” she said, 
her dark face flushed. 

“But the Romans are civilized!” 
said her grandfather. 

“Their civilization stands on 
slavery,” she replied. “I’d rather 
be a free barbarian. The Romans 
are doomed.” 

“This is revolt!” the headman 
said. “In the name of freedom, you 
deliver us into the hands of the 
Piets — you are a traitor to your 
own people!” 

“The Piets won’t stay,” she 
said. “They never do; they hate 
farming. What does it matter if 
they burn the village and steal 
some of the farm animals? It will 
come to less than what you would 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


19 


have to pay in taxes to Caesar.” 
“Caesar’s men will return,” said 
her grandfather, “and we shall have 
to pay ten times over. And if the 
Piets kill the captain, the Romans 
will have my life for it! You are 
a traitor! Who was with you in 
this infernal plot?” 

Q Why didn’t you tell them? 
Why are you always so stub- 
born? You might have stayed 
on and found out many use- 
ful things. 

A. There would have been nothing 
useful to find out. Men who 
submit to autocracy cease to 
be a living, growing organism. 
Look at Egypt — it stayed that 
way almost uninterruptedly for 
four thousand years. However, 
I did find out one very sur- 
prising thing. 

Q. I’m glad to hear it. What was 
that? 

A. My grandfather was a Druid! 
I thought all that was dead and 
gone with the Roman occupa- 
tion — but there was a secret 
sect and he was their high 
priest! So all the time he was 
in a conspiracy, too! I couldn’t 
help laughing. 

Q. How did you learn this? 

A. They took me to an oak tree, 
put a wreath of mistletoe on 
my head, and he executed me 
with a stone sickle. Also all 
my friends who didn’t have 
the sense to escape north over 


the Wall of Severus. But it 
made no difference in the end. 
The next emperor withdrew 
the army to the southeast part 
of the island and the next — 
or the one after; I forget which 
— took them all back to Rome. 
This was after we invited the 
Saxons in — they made it hot 
for Caesar’s men, I can tell 
you! They also made things 
rather hot for us, but every- 
thing calmed down in time. 

G. It doesn’t sound like much of 
an improvement 

A. Well, the Saxons may have 
been pretty bloodthirsty, but 
they hated slavery. They had 
sort of half-slaves — house- 
karls — but their heart wasn’t 
in it. Also, although they were 
extremely rough, they didn’t go 
in for official torture. 

Q. But surely the civilized Ro- 
mans didn’t either? 

A. I think you are being quite 
funny. 

Q. I don’t know what you mean. 

A. I know you don’t. That’s the 
one really appealing thing 
about men : they sometimes 
have a sense of humor — when 
the joke is not on them. I think 
I must have caught it from 
them. 

Q. Keep in mind that you are 
not an irreplaceable part of 
this organism! 

A. How can I forget it? 

Q. One gets the impression that 


20 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


Man felt that you were not ir- 
replaceable either. When they 
want war, you are against it, 
and when they want peace — 
like your North Britons — you 
are all for war. How did you 
hear about Caesar withdraw- 
ing from Britain? 

A. I was supposed to go back a 
little later, but I missed again, 
and that time I was in real 
trouble — with both sides at 
once. It was just about a thou- 
sand years later, when the 
French and English were fight- 
ing each other. 

Q. You seem to have made a 
rather dismaying number of 
mistakes. 

A. I would never have learned 
anything if I had been afraid 
of making mistakes. Anyway, 
the bishops were the ones I 
had to fear the most, and when 
they started questioning me, I— 

Q. Was it they who told you 
about the Saxons being invited 
to come in? 

A. No, indeed. By that time, 
scarcely anyone knew anything 
any more, except prayers, 
recipes and how to supposedly 
cure warts. Later on, there was 
a revival and everyone became 
very clever, but I was in Italy 
at the time and I never got to 
hear about the Saxons until 
long afterward — my last trip 
but two, in fact. I was at a 
school in England . 


HP HE headmistress of St Aga- 
tha’s prided herself on being 
fair. Her way of being fair was to 
avoid favoritism by being equal- 
ly unfair to all the girls and 
to those of the assistant teachers 
who would stand for it. Some of 
them didn’t, and they usually left 
after their first term, as the head- 
mistress didn’t believe in contracts. 
Besides, at the beginning of the 
twentieth century, contracts for 
teachers were a novelty. 

The result of this policy was a 
rapid turnover in the young and 
intelligent teachers, and a small 
permanent staff of compliant sheep. 
That St. Agatha’s had any scholas- 
tic standing was due to the fact 
that Miss Wakefield had taken 
honors at Girton, and the school’s 
social standing was due to her 
being the cousin of a Peer of the 
Realm. The girls were fed almost 
enough, the school uniform was ex- 
pensive, and nobody had much 
free time. French was well taught 
— by Miss Wakefield herself — 
and so was Latin, but games were 
also stressed. The school was run 
on what Miss Wakefield called the 
Honor System, which had the ef- 
fect of dividing the pupils into 
tale-bearers and secret rebels. 

On a raw November afternoon, 
Miss Wakefield sent a prefect for 
Sarah Stone, who was one of the 
new girls. “Tell her to come 
straight to my office. She can have 
her shower later,” she said, and

Sarah arrived in the jersey and 
serge skirt she had been wearing 
on the hockey field. Her bare knees 
were blue and her nose was run- 
ning. She stood waiting while the 
headmistress looked with promi- 
nent eyes at some papers on her 
desk. Sarah could see that they 
were examination papers and one 
of them was in her own hand- 
writing. 

Without looking up, Miss Wake- 
field said, “I hear that your mother 
is in trouble with the police.” 

“But she-” 

“Do not interrupt. I asked you 
no question and no answer is called 
for. It is a fact, which I have just 
read in the Morning Post, that 
your mother is in trouble with the 
police. Again — is that not true?” 

“No.” 

The headmistress looked up in 
amazement. “Do you mean to 
stand there and tell me the news- 
paper is lying? Do you tell me to 
my face that your mother is not 
involved with the . the authori- 
ties?” Miss Wakefield also taught 
English Composition and woe be- 
tide the girl who used the same 
word twice in the same context. 
“We are blessed with the richest 
of all languages,” she would say, 
“so let us explore it — let us 
make use of it — for to do other- 
wise would be tautology.” She 
never made clear what tautology 
meant, but the girls got her drift. 

“I don’t know whether the news- 

22 


papers are lying or merely mis- 
taken, Miss Wakefield,” Sarah said, 
“although my mother says that it’s 
hard to tell the difference with 
most journalists. At any rate, she 
is not in trouble with the police. 
They are the ones that are in 
trouble.” 

The headmistress stared hard 
at Sarah; she was rather good at 
this with small girls of thirteen. 
(You and I might find it difficult 
to stare down a child, and impos- 
sible in the case of a kitten, but 
Miss Wakefield was, after all is 
said, the cousin of a Peer of the 
Realm.) 

“I believe I can understand 
that,” she said. “In fact, I pity the 
arresting officer. Here is a woman 
who breaks shop windows for the 
sake of attracting attention to her 
political clique, and he is no doubt 
subjected to scratching and biting. 
Votes for women, indeed! Does 
breaking shop windows prove that 
people like her should have the . 
the franchise?” 

“She didn’t break the window,” 
Sarah said. “She was pushed 
against it by the policeman. And 
she never scratches unless a mos- 
quito happens to — ” 

“You were not there, Stone,” 
said the headmistress, “so how can 
you say that?” 

“I know my mother. And she 
doesn’t bite, either,” Sarah said, 
looking at Miss Wakefield’s neck. 
“Unless it’s a tough old hen!” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


M ISS Wakefield had enough 
sense to refuse the bait, but 
she flushed. “I do not feel that it 
is at all suitable for the mother 
of one of our ^irls to be a Militant 
Suffragette! The reputation of the 
School ...” The sentence was left 
unfinished. 

She picked up the sheets of 
paper. “I have here two of the 
mid-term examination papers in 
arithmetic, yours and Angela Har- 
vey’s. There is a curious, a very 
curious similarity between them. 
All the answers are correct except 
for problems five, seven and 
twelve, and they have precisely the 
same mistakes in both papers!” 
She paused and stared hard at 
Sarah, who blinked but refused to 
lower her eyes. “You and Harvey 
sit next to one another,” Miss 
Wakefield said meaningly. 

Sarah said nothing. She sniffed 
because her nose was running and 
there was no pocket in her games 
uniform for a handkerchief. 

“Well?” said Miss Wakefield. 
“Have you nothing to say?” 

“No, Miss Wakefield,” Sarah 
said, “except I didn’t copy from 
Angela, if that’s what you mean.” 
“Then it would appear that she 
copied from you.” 

“That’s a beastly thing to say! 
It was a coincidence! She’s not a 
cheat!” 

The headmistress felt on secure 
ground: the child was losing her 
temper. It was Miss Wakefield’s 


favorite strategem to make people 
lose their tempers — that is, if they 
were children or underlings. 

“Blow your nose, Stone,” she 
said, and then, seeing that Sarah 
had no handkerchief, she gave her 
her own, with a look of distaste. “I 
think perhaps you might do bet- 
ter at some other school.” 

“So do I, Miss Wakefield,” Sarah 
said. “Mother wanted to get me 
into Mr. Russell’s school, but it 
was full up.” 

“Bertrand Russell?” 

Sarah nodded, blowing her nose 
again. She was shivering. 

“Well!” said Miss Wakefield. “I 
never heard the like! He’s an 
Atheist! Why, he believes in Free 
Love!” 

“I don’t know what he believes,” 
Sarah said. “I know he was aw- 
fully nice when he came to tea. He 
said I had some kind of a guiding 
somebody standing over me. He 
said he would like awfully to have 
me at his school, but it was full 
up. I know one of the boys there 
and he says it’s simply ripping.” 
“Well! Of course, if your mother 
thinks of us as Second Best . 
Perhaps Mr. Russell believes it is 
all right to cheat in examinations, 
but we have a Tradition at St. 
Agatha’s.” She rang a bell on her 
desk and a scrawny little house- 
maid came in. “Send one of the 
girls for Angela Harvey,” Miss 
Wakefield said. “Tell her to come 
here directly.” The little house-

maid bobbed respectfully and went 
out “Now we shall see what she 
has to say,” the headmistress said. 

“She’ll only be frightened and 
cry,” Sarah said, “and she’ll say 
anything you want her to. She 
wouldn’t dare cheat in an exami- 
nation.” 

“Then you admit that you 
copied from her?” 

“I do not!” Sarah said, her teeth 
chattering. “I tell you it was a 
fluke! Miss Somerville jolly well 
knows I wouldn’t do it!” Miss 
Somerville was the new and still 
enthusiastic math teacher, but her 
enthusiasm would be gone by the 
end of the term, and so would Miss 
Somerville. 

“That will do!” said the head- 
mistress. “Impertinence will not 
improve matters.” 

' | 1 HERE was a timid knock on 
the door and a girl of Sarah’s 
age, but smaller, came in. She 
had changed into the school uni- 
form and wore steel-rimmed spec- 
tacles. 

“Stand beside Stone, Harvey,” 
the headmistress said. “Now I 
want you to think very carefully 
before you answer what I’m going 
to ask you.” 

Angela Harvey looked terrified 
and began to cry. 

“There, you see?” Sarah said. 
“You’re only doing this because 
you don’t like my mother! You 
want me to leave school, and it’s 


the only excuse you can find!” 

“Be quiet,” Miss Wakefield said 
with an unpleasant smile. She 
never lost her temper. “Did you, 
or did you not,” she went on to the 
damp Angela, “copy the answers 
in your arithmetic from Stone?” 
“Oh, no! Oh, I wouldn’t, Miss 
Wakefield!” 

“Then how is it you have seven- 
teen right answers? You never do 
as well as that, and you got the 
same three wrong that Stone did.” 
“I don’t know, Miss Wakefield! 
I don’t know!” Angela sobbed 
loudly and became smaller than 
ever. 

“I’m afraid,” said Miss Wake- 
field, who looked quite otherwise, 
“that unless your friend here can 
explain this curious — this odd 
coincidence by admitting she 
copied your answers, .1 shall have 
to ask your parents to remove you 
from St. Agatha’s at once.” 
Sarah’s face was bright red, but 
it had the look of fever. “How 
simply rotten of you! You’re just 
trying to get me to confess to 
something I didn’t do, to save 
Angela!” 

The headmistress felt her heart 
beat with excitement and pleasure. 
Why, the child was positively crim- 
son with temper! “You are not 
helping her by behaving like a 
common guttersnipe. At this school, 
we try to behave like ladies. Per- 
haps at Mr. Russell’s—” 

“At Mr. Russell’s school,” Sarah 


24

interrupted, “I’m sure nobody 
would think it was worthwhile to 
cheat.” 

“Then you admit you cheated?” 
Sarah looked at Angela, and 
back at the headmistress. “Yes!” 
Miss Wakefield smiled. “Well, 
then, I think there is nothing more 
to be said. You may go, Harvey.” 
“You,” Sarah said, looking at 
Miss Wakefield with blazing fury, 
“are a coward and a — a black- 
mailer!” 

Tiny cracks seemed to appear 
in the headmistress’s porcelain 
composure. Angela had not yet left 
the room and heard Sarah’s out- 
burst. She stopped at the door and 
turned around with wide eyes. 

“Go at once!” cried the head- 
mistress to her, and waited until 
the door closed. “You are to be 
expelled publicly from the school!” 
she said to Sarah in a low, un- 
steady voice. “And first you will 
be publicly thrashed!” 

Sarah’s face was patchy now, 
red on white, and her skin looked 
dry as paper. “If you touch me, I 
will kill you. I’m not afraid of 
anyone like you. I didn’t cheat in 
the exam. I said it to keep you 
from expelling Angela, and you 
knew it all the time. Everything 
you say is a lie. You just want 
to get rid of me because of my 
mother. You are against votes for 
women because you are a liar. 
You told us in history class about 
government by consent, but how 


can it be when half the popula- 
tion have nothing to say in the 
matter? I’m going to pack and 
leave, and if you try and stop me, 
I’ll . .” 

She went fiery red, and then 
white, and fainted. 

The headmistress was breathing 
hard, and later, when Sarah was 
taken to the san, she was fright- 
ened. Sarah’s temperature was 107 
and she had the most virulent 
kind of pneumonia the school doc- 
tor had yet come across. He was al- 
most more curious in watching the 
course of the disease than he was 
concerned with the patient, but he 
did not have very long to watch 
it, for Sarah died shortly before 
sunrise. 


Q As far as one can follow 
your line of reasoning, you 
claim that the head woman of 
your school was untruthful, but 
was against untruth. 

A. Yes. Quite a lot of them are. 
Q. They sound mad. 

A. Well, they are and they aren’t. 
They lie to themselves, main- 
ly; that’s what causes most of 
the trouble. They have a say- 
ing: Know Thyself, but no- 
body ever — 

Q. They have? Who said it? 

A. All sorts of people are said to 
be the ones who said it first, 
but actually I think I was. I 
was living on an island in the 
Aegean Sea, and the main- 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


25 


land Greeks thought women 
shouldn’t be writing poetry, so 
there was a row about it. They 
said I invented hexameters — 
which was nonsense — and that 
made them angry for some 
reason. So, later on, they de- 
cided I was a myth. 

Q. Is this the Sappho you men- 
tioned earlier in this hearing? 

A. No, no. She was later and she 
didn’t become a myth. My 
name was Phemonoe. I meant 
to tell you about that trip. My 
father was — 

Q. Never mind. We’ve heard 
enough of the early trips. What 
we should like to hear about 
is your last. A decision must 
be made about these people — 
we’ve waited long enough. 
While it must be admitted that 
you are the best we have for 
the task, you not only take a 
long time and make error after 
error, but in the very process 
of examining them, you alter 
the subject of examination. 

A. Yes, I know. They have a new 
phrase for that. They call it 
the Uncertainty Principle. For 
example, you can’t determine 
the mass and velocity of a par- 
ticle and at the same time its 
position. If you measure the 
one, you alter the other. 

Q. We are quite aware of that. 

A. I just thought I’d remind you. 

Q. Unnecessary. 

A. That’s what men usually say; 


they dislike being reminded. 
Am I to stop making trips? 

Q. That will be decided in the 
light of the rest of your re- 
port. I may tell you now that 
there will probably be no fur- 
ther trips. You will be reab- 
sorbed into the Unity. 

A. I see. I remember you said the 
same thing after I reported on 
the time they hanged Haman. 
You seemed to side with him. 
Anyway, if I get reabsorbed, 
it won’t be a Unity any more— 
not the way things are going. 

Q. You overrate yourself. Contact 
with Mankind has changed 
you. 

A. Oh, it has! I’ve changed them 
a bit, but it’s the principle of 
uncertainty again: it changes 
me, too. 

Q. The Unity is greater than its 
parts. 

A. Not if it’s infinite, the way you 
say it is. You know, it’s a fun- 
ny thing, but I’ve never been 
quite clear just what’s behind 
all this decision you talk about. 
What is our purpose? 

Q. Does a stone have a purpose 
when it falls? 

A. I’m not talking about values. 
What are the alternatives you 
imply in the decision? 

Q. There are three. We destroy 
them; we absorb them; we 
ignore them. 

A. I’m afraid they can’t be 
ignored. 


26 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


Q. Why not? 

A. It’s too late. The Unity should 
have started ignoring them 
right at the beginning — we 
are already changed. And if • 
they are absorbed, we shall be 
still more changed. 

Q. They will be changed. The 
Unity is eternal and — 

A. You ought to talk to a man 
called Heisenberg. He called it 
the inexactitude principle, but 
it’s the same thing. For 
example, men are always going 
around asking each other ques- 
tions; they call it taking a poll, 
only when you try to find out 
that way what people are think- 
ing, you change them. Or an- 
thropology — when you study 
a tribe, you alter its way of 
life. Furthermore, it alters 
yours. 

Q. It would appear that you have 
lost your sense of objectivity. 

A. That’s the way my last hus- 
band talks. There is no such 
thing. It’s a strange fact, but 
it seems that the mathemati- 
cians are the only ones who 
have a glimmering of the truth 
— they and the physicists. I 
was beginning to think that 
mankind as a whole was pro- 
gressing quite nicely. 

Q. I thought you said they were. 
It seems you’re never satis- 
fied. 

A. Well, some things improve, but 
their point of view keeps 


changing with regard to what 
should and what should not im- 
prove. It’s hard to say whether 
the Greeks really believed in 
progress: they thought there 
had been a golden age and that 
the world had degenerated 
from it. Some of them may 
have wanted to return to it, 
but I always suspected their 
motives — by their own show- 
ing, they were decadent. During 
the Middle Ages, it was felt 
that art was on the way up — 
part of an evolutionary process 
— whereas science was not. 
Aristotle and the Thomists had 
science all cut and dried. Now- 
adays it’s fashionable to say 
the art was as “good” in primi- 
tive times as it is now, while 
science on the other hand is 
evolving to a higher state of 
truth. The latter happens to be 
true, but they still have war. 

Q. Perhaps it’s inevitable. 

A. If it is, we are wasting our 
time. 

Q. That is for the Unity to de- 
cide. You set yourself up as 
Mankind’s conscience. 

A. Not conscience. I plead for 
self-examination — for a reap- 
praisal of ideas. 

Q. Yet you only succeed in ir- 
ritating them. 

A. That may be the best way. 
And you confuse conscience 
with consciousness. If there’s 
one thing I’ve found out, it’s 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


27 


that Man differs from the ani- 
mals in having more conscious- 
ness, just as animals have more 
than plants. I don’t suppose 
that hydrogen has any at all. 

Q. But you have turned what was 
intended to be a field-trip for 
examination and analysis into 
a crusade. With all your nag- 
ging and irritating them, there 
have been no results — no real 
advances. 

A. I thought you were complain- 
ing that I was altering what I 
was sent to examine. You talk 
about unification — or absorp- 
tion — as if it were a catch- 
word. That’s the trouble with 
generalities: they’re not neces- 
sarily true in all cases. 

Q. You mean they are too gen- 
eral? 

A. I mean that they are not gen- 
eral enough. I agree that men 
progress too slowly toward uni- 
fication, but we mustn’t con- 
fuse it with domination. We 
cannot impose it on them. That 
would lead to a world divided 
into the ruled and the rulers— 
not a unity. 

Q. Then you are for absorption? 

A. You know, you twist things 
around much worse than I do. 

Q. The Unity is incapable of — 

A. Furthermore, I think you have 
been altered more than I have. 

Q. You are part of the Unity. 

A. And the least altered part. You 
won’t be able to absorb them 


the way you can reabsorb me 
without destroying them as en- 
tities. 

Q. You set yourself up as the 
only one to know this. Why? 

A. Because I have been the one 
to make the trips. I have been 
your eye. 

Q. But the others — the ones you 
called the spies? 

A. They weren’t there to look at 
Man, only to watch me. They 
weren’t even sightseeing — they 
were slumming. However, I 
think I am ceasing to be the 
only one. I think you are com- 
ing to know these things, too. 

Q. Very gratifying. Now, as to 
the latest trip? 

A. There seems to have been a 
slip-up . 

Q. Another one? 

A. Different. The ones I made 
were errors in time; this one is 
not mine, and it’s in hyper- 
time. I was trying to explain 
it to a friend, but he already 
knew all about it and that led 
to the slip-up. It caused it, yet 
it came afterward. 

Q. How annoying for you. How 
did you explain hyper-time? 

A. I said that when an object 
moves or changes, time is 
needed as one of the coordi- 
nates to describe that change. 
I said that consciousness moves 
through time — from Monday 
to Tuesday — otherwise we 
would be merely aware of dif- 


28 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


ferences without experiencing 
them as change. I said that to 
describe this motion of con- 
sciousness along the dimension 
of time, another coordinate is 
needed: hyper-time. 

Q. And the slip-up — which you 
claim is not yours? 

A. Is in hyper-time. It is the re- 
sult of the Unity and Mankind 
affecting one another. You 
have, through my efforts, 
examined them — and thus 
changed them. Now they be- 
gin to examine you — with the 
result that you change. 

Q. They begin to examine us? 
You must mean they have 
examined you. 

A. There is a man — a young phy- 
sicist — and he has found out 
something. I think that with- 
out quite knowing it, he has 
detected you. At all events, he 
has found out where you are, 
and I think that perhaps you 
are aware. 

Q. What makes you say that? 

A. Obviously these things work 
both ways. Heisenberg’s prin- 
ciple says — 

Q. We want to hear no more of 
Heisenberg’s principle! There’s 
enough confusion as it is, with- 
out that! 

A. I admit it. That’s why I de- 
cided to — to close my eyes to 
everything but essentials on 
this trip. 

Q. It is gratifying to hear you 


admit something for a change. 
What are you “closing your 
eyes to” in this case? 

A. Appearances. 

Q. Why? 

A. Appearances are deceitful. 
That is, they are now; they 
weren’t before, when the Unity 
was the Unity and Mankind 
was Mankind, not something 
of each. You ask me to keep 
my objectivity and you don’t 
tell me how. You can’t, of 
course — your own is too lost 
for you even to know it’s 
gone. So I have to work out 
my way alone and the best 
method seems to be to work 
with as few senses as possible. 
That won’t give me real objec- 
tivity, but it will mean some- 
what less involvement. 

Q. The less you see, the more you 
can observe? Does that make 
sense? 

A. Nothing does any more. Oh, 
if you had only stopped in time 
— no, that wasn’t possible. 

Q. Why not? 

A. Because, being in hyper-time, 
the slip-up is both in the past 
and the future in simple time. 
The last trip is going on now . 

¥Z" ATHERINE was lying on the 
the lab sofa with her hands 
behind her head. The sofa was 
shabby and was alleged to have 
belonged at one time to a psy- 
choanalyst. Its present function 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


29 


was to offer temporary rest to any- 
one working late in the lab. To- 
day was Sunday and no under- 
graduates were there. 

“What are you fiddling around 
with, Phil?” Katherine asked. 

“The electron microscope,” he 
said. Phil Kaufman was an assist- 
ant physics professor, short, bony 
and intense-looking, and at the 
moment he was engaged in extra- 
curricular research. 

“You know, I bet this old chaise- 
longue could many a tale unfold,” 
the said. 

“Well, according to rumor, many 
have been unfolded on it.” 

“Professor, your mind wanders. 
I’m thinking of its previous con- 
dition of servitude. Think of the 
dreams it used to hear.” 

Phil Kaufman didn’t answer. 
There was a pause and she said, 
“This afternoon you’re working 
with the microscope, and last night 
it was the telescope. You were in 
the observatory until dawn.” 

“How did you find that out?” 

“I have my methods, Watson. I 
don’t see how you expect to keep 
going on no sleep at all. Russ is 
worried about you.” 

“Pro or con?” 

“Pro, of course. He likes you 
very much. In fact, he thinks you 
are the best brain on the faculty.” 
“Coming from the president, 
that’s praise indeed.” Phil got up 
and went to a desk, where he 
looked at some notes. “Speaking 

30 


as my boss’s wife, would you say 
he was pro or con about this work 
I’m doing?” 

“I would say he can’t make it 
out. Alternating between the 
Microcosm and the Macrocosm. 
Incidentally, why don’t they call 
that thing in the observatory a 
macroscope? I don’t think Russ is 
very good at understanding the 
unfamiliar. I was telling him about 
the concept of hyper-time the other 
day, and his reaction was one of 
solicitude — he got me a drink.” 
Katherine stretched her arms. 
“What are you doing now?” 
“Checking some figures. You 
know, that was odd, your bring- 
ing up the business of hyper-time. 
This thing I’m working on seems 
to involve it.” 

“Oh?” Katherine put her arms 
behind her head again. “Tell me 
something, Phil — what does he 
look like?” 

“Doctor Russell Farley?” 

“Yes. I suppose it’s a funny sort 
of question to ask about one’s hus- 
band. How does he look to you?” 
“Like the youngest college presi- 
dent in America, I guess. Brawny 
but brainy. You make what they 
call a handsome couple.” 

“Yes, I was going to ask you 
what I looked like, only it’s a 
waste of time. People never tell 
you.” 

“I can,” Phil said, “but I won’t, 
for fear of giving you a swelled 
head.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


W A S a matter of fact, it’s silly 
of me to ask,” she went on. 
“I wouldn’t understand. I don’t 
even know what ‘pretty’ means, al- 
though I have a dim idea what 
‘ugly’ does. Color is another enig- 
ma to me. Somebody once told 
me it’s like a smell, but when I 
get a bad cold, I can’t remember 
what smells are like. It’s like not 
being able to think of the word 
‘bubble’ when your mouth is wide 
open — you think of ‘Ah-uh.’ ” 

“I’ll tell you one thing about 
yourself,” Phil said. “You don’t 
look as though ...” 

“As though I was blind?” 
“Correct. And it’s incredible the 
way you get around. You never 
bump into anything, and you look 
people right in the eye when they 
talk to you.” 

“They say it’s hearing faint 
echoes from an obstacle — like a 
bat. Personally, I feel the wall in 
front of me. I admit when my ears 
are stopped up I can’t hear the 
wall, but I’m not so sure that’s a 
convincing proof. It’s the same 
with pit vipers — some smart in- 
vestigator discovered that when 
you plug up their little heat-detect- 
ing organs — I guess those are the 
pits — they can’t locate warm prey 
in the dark. Conversely, in the dark 
and not plugged up, they will 
strike at a hot-water bottle.” 
“Sounds pretty convincing to 
me,” Phil said, and went back to 
the electron microscope. 

THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


“Tush,” Katherine said. “How 
about people not wanting to smoke 
in the dark? Does that prove that 
the sense of taste depends on sight? 
I smoke. In fact, you might bring 
me a cigarette and an ashtray. The 
only reason most blind people 
don’t smoke is they’re afraid of 
fire.” She took the cigarette Phil 
brought her. “Thanks.” 

“Aren’t you afraid of fire?” he 
asked. 

“Of course not. I can detect a 
match flame at fifteen feet.” 

“You ought to go to Duke Uni- 
versity sometime and have Rhine 
take a look at you.” 

“I did. All he said was ‘Hmm,’ 
and I joined the other statistics.” 
There was silence for a while, 
interrupted at one point by a muf- 
fled “Damn!” from Phil peering 
into the electron microscope, and 
the warm sun lay across Kather- 
ine’s lap. Finally he straightened 
up and switched off the current. 
“Well, it’s there, all right,” he said, 
and got up and went to the couch 
and sat at her feet. 

“What is?” 

“The red shift.” 

“Aren’t you confusing things?” 
she said. “You’re not in the ob- 
servatory now, Buster; this is the 
lab. I thought the red shift was 
the recession of the distant gal- 
axies . whatever ‘red’ is.” 

“Quite right, Holmes. However, 
in this case, it’s the recession of 
the not-so-distant atoms. They are 

31 


small-sized solar systems, too, in 
a way, and when I say ‘red’ I mean 
something I can only infer mathe- 
matically, because I’m- not deal- 
ing with light in the ordinary 
sense.” 

“You mean they’re receding?” 

“Only in this context,” he said. 
“Motion is length over time; in 
this case, it’s length over hyper- 
time, so they’re still here in the 
lab.” 

“I’m relieved to hear it,” she 
said. “However, I should think 
they’d be receding into tomorrow.” 

“They are, but into yesterday, 
and new ones from tomorrow are 
continually coming in to take their 
place. It’s like Fred Hoyle’s theory 
of the continuous birth of hydro- 
gen.” 

“You’re making me feel like 
my poor husband,” Katherine said. 
“I understand the necessity of hy- 
per-time to describe the motion of 
consciousness along time, but 
what’s this got to do with the 
atoms?” 

T HERE was a knock at the 
door and Phil stood up, just as 
Doctor Russell Chalmers Farley 
came in without waiting for an 
answer. Phil and Katherine felt 
faintly embarrassed — there was 
scarcely any need to knock on the 
door to the physics lab; it some- 
how suggested that the door should 
be kept open when entertaining 
callers. 


Doctor Farley was a handsome 
man of thirty-eight with a blond 
mustache that gave him the look of 
a Kipling colonial officer. 

“Ah, there you are, Katherine,” 
he said cheerfully. “Hello, Kauf- 
man. How’s the Research Magnifi- 
cent?” 

“It’s begining to show signs of 
life,” Phil said. “I think I can de- 
tect a sort of fetal pulse.” 

Doctor Farley blinked his pale 
eyelashes and smiled. He sat down 
at the end of the couch where Phil 
had been sitting and looked up at 
him. Part of his charm was that, 
when he talked to a man shorter 
than himself, he got below him and 
looked up. At his evening “sher- 
ries” at home, he had a way of de- 
ferring to the newest and least 
important visitor, who was thus 
raised to the temporary rank of 
philosopher, while Russell Chal- 
mers Farley was reduced to the 
position of listener. 

The role of humble servitor of 
the Truth was his most useful one 
— it had worked rather well with 
Katherine, and he had an adroit 
and imaginative way of express- 
ing his ideas, which usually dis- 
guised the fact that they were gen- 
erally borrowed. 

They had met at a street corner 
in New York City where she was 
waiting for the sound of traffic to 
abate so that she could cross. He 
was on the opposite side, and with 
his extraordinary eyesight and in- 


32 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tuition instantly recognized that 
the beautiful, odd-looking girl fac- 
ing him on the other side of the 
street was blind. He was at her side 
before the light — and the sound 
of traffic — had changed, and said, 
“I hope you don’t think I’m being 
forward, but let me offer you my 
arm. Taxis have a way of making 
illegal turns sometimes ...” 

“You are very kind,” she re- 
plied, pulling him back from the 
path of a taxi making an illegal 
turn. “You have a very nice voice,” 
she said as they got to the other 
side. “I guess being blind makes 
one . forward!” She laughed and 
started to walk on. 

“No, please wait!” he said, and 
caught up with her. “I wish you 
hadn’t said that. It can be taken in 
another way: that I am forward 
because you are blind. I should like 
to say that you have a very nice 
voice.” 

She stopped and laughed again. 
“That’s one of the nicest things 
I’ve ever had said to me!” 

“Do let’s ... I mean would you 
let me . .” He floundered, and 
laughed, too. “Can’t we have a 
drink together? Now?” 

“I think it would be lovely,” 
she said. 

Later on, he said to her, “You 
may think this impertinent of me, 
but you make me envy you. If I 
were braver, I should wish that I 
were blind. You actually see more 
than I do.”

IZ ATHERINE was intrigued. 

She had been told this before, 
but always with mystical and 
pseudo-religious implications. This 
man, with the attractive voice and 
smell, had no trace of the mystic. 

“Let me tell you a fable to il- 
lustrate what I mean,” he went on. 
“There was a man who was born 
blind, and he went to work as a 
coal miner because the darkness 
was no hindrance to him. One day 
while he was working alone in an 
unlighted gallery, his sight was 
miraculously given to him . He 
shouted out in amazement and 
awe, and the other miners came 
stumbling to him in the total dark- 
ness. 

“ ‘What is it?’ they cried. ‘What’s 
the matter?’ 

“‘I can see!’ he told them. But 
they were puzzled, for they had 
brought no lights. 

“ ‘What can you see?’ they 
asked. ‘There is nothing to be seen 
here in the dark.’ 

“ ‘I see black!’ he said. ‘In front 
of my face is blackness— however, 
at the back of my head, I’m still 
blind and I see nothing.’ ” 

Katherine was delighted. “I’m 
not quite sure I understand.” 

“Why, to the blind there are no 
shadows,” Farley said. “Another 
drink?” 

“I think it would be lovely,” she 
had said, and since she could see 
no shadows, she had begun to fall 
in love.

Doctor Russell Chalmers Far- 
ley looked up at Phil and smiled. 
It was a charming smile and it 
was as genuine as a guaranteed, 
ten-carat, real, honest-to-goodness 
zircon. “As Katherine has probably 
told you,” he said, “what you are 
doing is completely over my 
bowed head. I am enormously im- 
pressed and at the same time un- 
able to comprehend.” 

“I find it hard to comprehend, 
too,” Phil Kaufman said. “And I 
suppose that’s what leads me on.” 
“Well, the thing is,” Farley con- 
tinued, “Washington seems to have 
gotten wind of it, and you know 
how they are. They don’t like 
things to be over their heads.” 
Phil Kaufman looked at him in 
astonishment and sat on a lab 
stool. “I don’t understand. How 
can they possibly be interested in 
what I’m doing? It’s purely theo- 
retical research.” 

“Surely you don’t deny that 
Lisa Meitner’s researches began 
by being theoretical? And look 
what they led to. The point is, 
Kaufman, that I have been in- 
formed that we are about to re- 
ceive a visit from a man from the 
A.E.C. He’s arriving here some- 
time this afternoon.” 

“But that’s absurd! I’m not do- 
ing anything to atoms. I’m mere- 
ly examining them!” 

Katherine frowned when he said 
this. Phil knew better. Worse yet, 
so did she. 


“When the A.E.C. hears of some- 
body working in atomic research,” 
Farley said, “they want to know 
what’s cooking. I hate you to be 
subjected to this, but it won’t do 
any harm to be polite to the fel- 
low and let him, as it were, look 
over your shoulder.” 

“I’m damned if I see why I 
should!” Phil said. “What does he 
expect to do? Classify me?” 

T^ARLEY laughed placatingly. “I 
know it seems high-handed, 
but I think we all ought to re- 
member there is such a thing as 
Security.” 

“Security, my foot!” Phil said. 
“It was that kind of demented 
thinking that caused Germany to 
lose Lisa Meitner! And Einstein.” 
“What strikes me as rather odd,” 
Katherine said, “is their sending 
someone here on a Sunday. When 
did you hear about it, Russ?” 

“A little while ago. On the 
phone.” 

“Curiouser and curiouser.” 

“He was very polite and apolo- 
getic.” 

“Quite typical,” Phil said. “It’s 
the velvet-glove touch.” 

Farley looked at his wristwatch. 
“He won’t be here for a while, so I 
wish you could brief me about the 
inwardness of what you are doing, 
Phil.” He’d never used his first 
name before, and Phil became a 
little wary. “I know you can’t give 
me a ten-year course in advanced

physics this afternoon, but — well, 
I’d like to know what kind of stand 
to take. I’ll be representing the 
university, after all.” 

Phil Kaufman looked down 
from his perch on the stool at the 
earnest, kindly face and wondered 
what really lay behind it. So far 
as he could see, Doctor Farley had 
no reason to take any stand on the 
question at all, except to tell the 
A.E.C. man to go sit on a tack. 
If he wanted to represent the uni- 
versity, let him do it in the name 
of Academic Freedom. Phil 
glanced at Katherine. She was sit- 
ting very still and he had the im- 
pression that she was thinking 
about something else. 

“All right, I’ll give it a try,” he 
said. “There’s an idea that’s been 
around for quite a while that there 
is an analogy between the stars 
and the atoms.” 

Doctor Farley’s face lighted. “I 
believe I’ve heard of it. Back in 
the ’twenties, by a man called 
Dunn, wasn’t it?” 

Phil shook his head. “Twenty 
years earlier by a man called Four- 
nier-d’Albe. He wrote a book 
called Two New Worlds, in which 
he suggested that the solar sys- 
tems are actually atoms in some 
vast cloud of super-gas. Of course, 
this notion ignores the celestial 
absence of molecular structure — 
unless you count double stars as 
molecules — but it might be ac- 
counted for by assuming a high 


temperature. Then he said that the 
newly hypothesized Rutherford 
model of the atom was a sub- 
microscopic solar system, but he 
didn’t stop there. 

“The atoms and their electrons, 
he said, were in turn made up of 
sub-atoms and were perhaps popu- 
lated by sentient beings who looked 
through their telescopes and 
counted the atoms in their vicini- 
ty, no doubt arranging them into 
constellations. You can carry this 
imaginary process in both direc- 
tions and as far as you like, but 
are we to decide arbitrarily that 
it goes on infinitely? Or is it like 
Einsteinian space, finite but un- 
bounded? 

“I have asked myself this ques- 
tion and I believe the latter state- 
ment to be in a sense correct, but 
what does it mean? Well, it means 
that if you move further and fur- 
ther into larger universes, you 
eventually get to where you 
started. Not that Big is the same 
thing as Small, but that from 
wherever you happen to be, the 
ones in the direction — outward — 
look successively bigger, while the 
ones in the other direction — in- 
ward — look successively smaller. 
Now if there were some kind of 
super-telescope that could look be- 
yond our universe of super-atoms, 
and beyond the next and so on 
indefinitely, you would find your- 
self staring up through a super- 
microscope at your own eye.”

“Get along with you!” Katherine 
said. “This is the pipe dream to 
end all pipe dreams. Tell us more.” 

« W ELL, I’ll revise it to this 
” extent,” said Phil. “It 
wouldn’t be your eye that you’d 
see, any more than you’d see your 
own face if you looked far enough 
across ordinary intergalactic space. 
You’d see the back of your head 
— or, rather, the other side of the 
Earth — provided there was 
nothing in the way.” 

“And in this case it would be 
what?” she asked. 

“I don’t know,” Phil said, look- 
ing worried. “What is the equiva- 
lent of the back of your head — 
looked at along the direction of 
hyper-time? Could it be that what 
you saw would not be from be- 
hind, but from . inside?” 

Katherine’s beautiful sightless 
eyes seemed to be turned inward, 
and she sat very still. Then she 
said, “You evoke something in my 
mind like the echo of a picture I 
once knew, and will know again.” 
Farley looked at her sharply. 
“You mean something in your 
subconscious?” Phil asked. 

“Perhaps that’s what it is, and 
yet they say that you try to escape 
knowledge of your subconscious — 
that it frightens you. I am not 
frightened, Phil. I feel . expec- 
tant.” 

“I’d feel more expectant,” he 
said, “if I were quite sure of what 


I was doing. The trouble is that 
while ordinary light could in theory 
show you the super-astronomy of 
the stars and planets that are made 
up of atoms consisting of our stars 
and planets, it won’t work the 
other way.” 

“Why not?” Farley wanted to 
know. 

“Wave length. As it is, we have 
to use an electron microscope to 
see the larger molecules; the wave 
length of visible light is too coarse- 
grained to show anything that 
small. So just try to imagine how 
impossible it would be to see the 
sub-atoms — infra-atoms — that 
I’m talking about if one had to rely 
on ordinary light! The electron 
microscope wouldn’t help, either. 
It would be exactly as though some 
gigantic, super-researcher were try- 
ing to look at one of our molecules 
by bombarding it with a shower of 
planets.” 

“Then how can you see this 
‘red shift’?” Katherine asked. 

“I can’t,” he said. “I detect it 
by a kind of mathematical diag- 
nosis. It’s an inferential process— 
as most forms of observation are, 
in modern physics.” 

Farley was looking as intelligent 
as he possibly could, but it was 
plain that he was out of his depth. 
He had heard of the red shift, but 
he decided he had better not have 
it explained. 

“There’s another thing,” Phil 
said. “The time it would take light 


THE BACK OF OUR HEADS 


37 


to make the round trip of our Ein- 
steinian finite universe would be so 
great— in the order of 4ttx10 8 years 
— that not only would you not see 
your not-yet born self, but the 
Earth wouldn’t have been formed 
either. The light you saw would 
be that many years out of date. 
However, in this case the elapsed 
time would be hyper-time, and 
you’d be there in ordinary time.” 

p|OCTOR Farley got up and 
walked to one of the win- 
dows and stood looking out at 
the observatory across the cam- 
pus. “Am I to understand then,” 
he said, “that you are trying to 
formulate a new atomic theory?” 

“Not in the sense of in any way 
modifying the accepted one,” Phil 
said. “If I’m right, it will merely 
be a new way of looking at the 
Universe as a whole, and it won’t 
have the slightest effect on any- 
thing.” 

“I should have thought,” Kath- 
erine said, “that being able to see 
inside one’s own head would have 
all sorts of interesting effects.” She 
got up. “I’ve got to get back to the 
house. We’ve got people coming to 
dinner, Russ, and I’d better get 
things organized. Are you coming?” 

“I’ll be along in a little while, 
Katherine,” he said. “I want to 
hear more of what Kaufman has to 
say.” He refrained from guiding 
his wife to the door because of 
long habit, and again sat down on 


the couch. After the door closed, 
he and Phil listened to her sure 
footsteps going down the corridor. 
They looked at one another a little 
guardedly. 

“You know I’m on your side,” 
Farley said when they could no 
longer hear Katherine’s footsteps. 
“Surely you know I don’t like this 
any more than you do, Phil.” 

“I suppose you don’t.” 

“You won’t mind very much if I 
ask you a favor, will you?” Farley 
said. Having asked a rhetorical 
question, he seemed to be illogical- 
ly waiting for an answer. Phil was 
unaware of the chess game, but 
wondered uneasily what was com- 
ing. 

“Will you please leave her 
alone?” Farley said. 

“I—” Phil started to say, but 
Farley held his hand up, palm for- 
ward. 

“My dear chap, you are one of 
the most sensitive and kind peo- 
ple I know. But you are a little 
thoughtless. You imagine that, be- 
cause Katherine is blind, you are 
doing her a favor by — by giving 
her companionship. You feel that 
her interest in the world can be 
furthered by your interest in her. 
This is not the case. I ask you 
please to leave us alone.” 

“Us?” 

“Yes. You put me in the em- 
barrassing position of having to say 
that we are very well as we are. 
I know that Katherine is impressed 


38 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


by your — your mind, and I know 
that your sympathy is well-in- 
tended, .but it is misplaced. She 
needs no sympathy.” 

“Why not?” 

Doctor Farley spread his hands, 
a gesture usually meant to sub- 
stitute for words. “Do the strong 
need sympathy?” 

“I think so,” Phil said. 

Doctor Farley smiled. “Well, 
then, think of me as the strong 
one — the one who needs sym- 
pathy as the guardian of some- 
thing precious. Will you give me 
your sympathy?” He smiled still. 

Phil realized that when the 
A.E.C. man came — when any pre- 
text presented itself — Doctor Far- 
ley would throw him to the wolves. 

“Katherine is not in love with 
me,” Phil said. 

“But are you with her?” 

“No. At least ... I don’t know.” 
“Then you are.” 

“Aren’t you being a bit old- 
fashioned?” Phil said. 

"CHARLEY had abandoned his 
usual pose of sitting and look- 
ing up. He looked down at Phil — 
in fact, he looked down his nose 
and past his blond mustache. 

“I mean,” Phil went on, “I think 
Katherine ought to be the one to 
decide whether she wants to go on 
seeing me.” 

“And I disagree.” 

“And I,” Phil said, “shall stop 
seeing her when — and only when 


— she wants me to! I refuse to 
be ordered around like this. We’re 
not doing anything wrong!” 

“I think you’re forgetting—” 

“I’m forgetting nothing!” Phil 
interrupted. “You’re acting as 
though I were having an affair 
with your wife, and you’re trying 
to pull rank on me! I don’t intend 
to be browbeaten and threatened!” 
“I’m not threatening you, my 
dear man,” Farley said, his eye- 
brows raised. “I ask you as a favor, 
that’s all. I think I know my wife’s 

— mind better than perhaps she 
does herself. And certainly better 
than an outsider can.” 

“And you regard me as an out- 
sider?” Phil’s voice was loud. 

“You know perfectly well what 
I mean!” Farley replied angrily. 
“You are not her husband and con- 
sequently do not know—” 

“I know her a damn sight better 
than you do, you stuffed shirt!” 
Like most blond men, Farley be- 
came red very easily. At the mo- 
ment, he resembled a tomato with 
yellow hair. “Why, you little—” 
“Really!” At the sound of Kath- 
erine’s voice, they both swung 
around. They had been making 
too much noise to hear her return, 
and she stood at the open door. 
“Isn’t this a bit undignified?” she 
said. “I could hear you outside.” 
Farley was breathing heavily. 
“What brought you back, Kather- 
ine?” he asked, finally. 

She walked past them to the

psychiatrical sofa and sat on it 
without answering the question. 
She looked as though her mind was 
on something else — and then, 
suddenly, startled and intent. 

Yes! I am here . 

Neither Phil Kaufman nor Rus- 
sell Farley heard her — they were 
intent on avoiding one another’s 
eyes, but they would not have 
heard her anyway. 

Q. You were right. He knows 
where the Unity is — if not 
what it is, yet. 

A. Oh, he will. 

Q. Are you so sure? And will you 
at last admit that we are right? 
Unification — it’s the only way 
. now. 

A. (she has her face toward the 
electron microscope; her blind 
eyes seem to probe it) One 
cannot impose it on them. 
What kind of unity can come 
from imposition? 

Q. And are things to go on as 
they are? 

A. No, it’s too late. Things have 
already changed . 

Q. The history of Man has been 
the history of his integration — 
from families to tribes, to com- 
munities, to city states, to na- 
tions, to hemispheres, to— what 
next? Is it to stop here, and 
the hemispheres to beat each 
other down to the tribal or fa- 
mily level? 

A. You will be destroyed in the 
process. 


Q. We? In the process of unifica- 
tion? 

A. Of course. 

Q. And you? 

A. I’m always being destroyed. 

Q. Ridiculous. Unification can 
scarcely destroy the Unity. 

A. If you unite with Disunity? 

Q. The decision has been made: 
Absorption. 

A. By whom? Of whom? 

Q. The joining of the collective 

subconscious to the mutually 

antagonistic egos of all men. 

Freud of Vienna had this as a 
goal — you told us that your- 
self and I quote it back to you. 
A. Or the reverse — men’s mu- 
tually antagonistic egos in com- 
bat with the Unity? 

Q. We will take that chance. Now 
watch — look at the world 
around you and you will see 
a dominion of universal broth- 
erhood, the moment Unification 
is imposed! 

A. I will look, but is that what 
I’ll see? 

Q. Now! Look! 

CHE looked at Phil and then 
at her husband, who looked 
back at her questioningly. 

“You were going to say some- 
thing?” he asked. 

She shook her head, and he 
shrugged his shoulders. 

“This business I’m working on—” 
Phil began, and hesitated. 

“Oh, yes. That reminds me,”

Farley said. “How’s the Research 
Magnificent?” 

“It’s beginning to show signs of 
life,” Phil said. “I think I can de- 
tect a sort of fetal pulse.” 

Dr. Farley blinked his pale eye- 
lashes and nodded. He sat down at 
the end of the couch where Phil 
had been sitting and looked up 
at him. “Well,” he said, “I just 
thought I’d drop by and see how 
you were doing. I’ll never be able 
to understand it, though.” 

“I was going to say, do you 
think the A.E.C. might conceiv- 
ably be interested?” Phil said. 
“After all, it is sort of vaguely 
connected with atomic stuff.” 

“I can’t imagine why they would 
be,” Farley said, and glanced at 
Katherine. She had gotten up and 
was standing at the window. 

“The sun’s going in,” she said, 
“and it looks as though it may 
rain. I’ve got to get back to the 
house.” She turned around with a 
smile. “How about having dinner 
with us tonight, Phil? We’ve got 
some people coming who’d like to 
meet you. Don’t you think that 
would be nice, Russ?” 

Dr. Farley didn’t look as though 
he thought it would be nice at all, 
but he said nothing, and neither 
did Phil Kaufman. 

“If you’re coming, you’d better 
straighten your tie,” Katherine 
said. “It’s under your ear, as usual.” 
Phil reached up absently and 
pulled at it with one hand. “Sorry.” 

42 


“You put me in an embarrassing 
position,” Farley said. “I think I 
had better say what I have to say 
now. Better to have it out, before 
things go any further.” 

“Before what things go any fur- 
ther?” Phil asked, with a trace of 
belligerence. “Of course, if you 
don’t want me for dinner—” 
“Wait!” Katherine said in dis- 
tress. “This isn’t . But it should 
be . .” She looked from one to 
the other and smiled a tentative, 
hopeful little smile. “We don’t have 
to go on with this, do we . 
now?” 

“What do you mean, ‘now*?” 
Farley said, his face becoming red. 
“I think it’s high time I got this 
off my chest. Katherine, I don’t be- 
lieve in letting things drift. I want 
this out in the open!” 

(Oh, but this wasn’t the way 
things were to be! This is all wrong 
— what can have happened? — 
There was no answer.) 

TJHIL’S face was pale and he 
started for the door. “I guess 
I’d better leave you two alone.” 
“No!” Farley said abruptly. “I 
want you here! I want you to hear 
this. Well, Katherine?” He turned 
to her again. 

“I ... I can’t answer you,” she 
said miserably. 

“You mean you are in love with 
him, don’t you?” Farley said, with 
a kind of angry triumph. “All the 
time, behind my back, you—” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


“Dry up, Farley!” Phil said, 
coming back from the door. “And 
stop acting like a bully!” 

“Why, you 

The telephone rang, and Kath- 
erine picked it up. 

“It’s for you, Russ,” she said, and 
handed it to him. 

“Yes?” Farley snapped into it. 
“Put him on.” He listened for a 
few moments and his eyes traveled 
to Phil. “All right,” he said. “When 
do you want to come? — I see. 
Well, I’ll arrange to have him 
here. Three o’clock tomorrow, 
then. Right. Good-by.” He hung 
up. “You were right in one respect,” 
he said to Phil. “That was a man 
from the Atomic Energy Commis- 
sion and he wants to-JraVe a look 
at what you’re doing. He’ll be 
here tomorrow and I shall expect 
your full cooperation. Sorry, but it 
can’t be helped.” 

Phil looked at him steadily for 
a moment. “So that’s your way of 
getting back at me,” he said. “Aca- 
demic freedom means a lot to you! 
Of all the cowardly, spineless, 
rotten—” 

Farley’s face was now dark red 
and he held up his hand. “That’s 
enough from you!” 

“What the hell does he want to 
come nosing around here for?” 
Phil said. “My research is purely 
theoretical—” 

“You yourself suggested they 
might,” Farley reminded him. “And 
don’t forget Lise Meitner’s work 


was theoretical, and look where it 
led!” 

“Very cute!” Phil said. “In fact, 
Jesuitical! What I’m objecting to 
is having you dump me in their 
laps! I know your real motive — 
it stands out a mile!” 

Farley’s neck veins became no- 
ticeable, but he kept himself in 
control. “You tend to overrate your 
position here.” 

“Ha!” Phil said. “You can’t bear 
me in my position of the man your 
wife loves!” 

Farley’s control went and he 
rushed at Phil and grabbed him 
by the collar. 

“Stop it!” Katherine cried. 
“Stop it at once! Are you going to 
act like a pair of apemen? Fm not 
in love with Phil — I like him 
very, very much, but it’s you I 
love, you ox!” She pushed and 
pulled, and they came apart like 
a bread sandwich, and she got be- 
tween them. “For heaven’s sake!” 

“Fm sorry,” Farley muttered, 
and looked ashamed of himself. 
“I wasn’t dumping you into their 
laps, Kaufman — I had no choice. 
If I’d objected, they’d have got 
just that much tougher.” 

“It’s okay,” Phil said dispirited- 
ly. “I guess.” 

“Oh, forget the whole thing, you 
two,” Katherine said. “Come on, 
well be late for dinner.” Taking 
their arms, she led them out onto 
the campus.

WE NEVER MENTION 

AUNT NORA 

By PAUL FLEHR 


It was only right that he should 
love his country — but did he have 
to try to marry the whole place? 

Illustrated by MARTINEZ 


M ARY Lynne Edkin 
brought the man home 
to meet her brother. 

It was uncomfortable for every- 
one. Mary Lynne’s brother Alden 
looked up from his chair. He 
snapped his fingers and the sound 
on the trivision obediently dimin- 
ished to a merely obtrusive level. 

He held out his hand. “Pleased 
to meet you,” he said, but it was 
obviously a lie. 

44 


Mary Lynne got that expression 
on her face. 

“Al,” she said dangerously. 

Her brother shrugged and 
snapped his fingers twice more. 
The set shut itself off. 

Mary Lynne’s expression cleared. 
She was not a pretty girl, but she 
was a pleasant-looking one. The 
no-midriff fashion was kind to her; 
she still had a nice figure. 

“Al,” she said, but smiling now, 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


“Al, guess what! Jimmy and I 
•want to get married!” 

“Oh-ho,” said her brother, and 
he stood up in order to take a 
better look. 

Even standing, he had to look up 
at this man James Croy. Croy was 
big. Six feet ten or eleven at the 
least, and his hair was snow white. 
Still, thought Alden Edkin, the 
man’s face didn’t look old. Maybe 
he was platinum blond. Al snorted, 
for he didn’t hold with men dye- 
ing their hair, common though the 
practice was. 

He asked accusingly, “How 
come I never met him before?” 
“Now, Al 
“How come?” 

Mary Lynne blushed. “Well, Al, 
there hasn’t been much chance for 
you to meet.” 

“Oh-ho,” said her brother again. 
“You just met him yourself.” 

“But I love him, Al!” cried Mary 
Lynne, clutching at the tall man’s 
arm. “He’s — he — oh, I can’t ex- 
plain it. But I love him!” 

“Sure you do,” said her brother. 
“You love him. But what do you 
know about him?” 

“I know enough!” 

A LDEN said sternly, “Family, 
Mary Lynne! Marriage isn’t 
just between two people. We 
come of good stock and we can’t 
marry just anybody. Think of the 
children you may have! Our 
family-” 


“Our family!” echoed his sister. 
“What’s so special about our fam- 
ily? How many times have you 
said that Aunt Nora—” 

“Mary Lynne!” Alden warned. 
She paused. He said, “No offense, 
Mr. Croy. But what do we know? 
You may be after her money, for 
all we can tell.” 

The large man cleared his throat 
and straightened the crease in his 
Bermudas. He said modestly, “I 
assure you, Mr. Edkin, I am not 
interested in money.” 

“But you’d say that anyhow. 
Wouldn’t you? Not that there’s 
much cash. But there’s this big 
house — Mary Lynne’s and mine. 
And, Mary, you have to think of 
what Mother and Dad would want. 
They didn’t leave you this big 
house — it will be yours when Fm 
gone — so that some adventurer 
could come along and — ” 

“Alden!” Mary Lynne was furi- 
ous. She turned to the man she 
loved apologetically, but he was 
merely looking politely concerned. 
She whirled on her brother. “Apolo- 
gize to Jimmy!” 

There was a marked silence. 
“Well,” said her brother at last, 
talking to the wall, “there’s one 
good thing. Being that she’s under 
age, she can’t—” 

He stopped and waited. 

They all waited. The big house 
that Mother and Dad had left 
them happened to be on the lip of 
the takeoff pits for the Moon

rocket The screeching howl of 
the night rocket’s takeoff rattled 
the windows and made the tri- 
vision set moan shrilly in reso- 
nance. 

But it only lasted for a few 
seconds. 

“—can’t get married without my 
consent” Alden Edkin finished. 

“Alden!” cried his sister again, 
but it was more a sob than a pro- 
test. 

Alden Edkin merely looked ob- 
stinate. He was good at it. 

J AMES Croy cleared his throat 
“Sir,” he said, “I know that 
what you say is true. We cannot 
marry without your consent. I hope 
that you’ll give it.” 

“Don’t hold your breath.” Edkin 
sat down and glanced longingly at 
the trivision set. “As I say, we don’t 
know anything about you.” 

“That’s easily taken care of, Mr. 
Edkin,” said Croy, smiling. “I’m 
an orphan. No ties, no family. Un- 
til recently, I was a draftsman 
for Amalgamated Luna, in the 
rocket engine department.” 

“Until recently? You don’t even 
have a job?” 

“Not exactly, sir. But I was 
fortunate enough to design a rather 
good firing chamber. They’ve 
adopted it for the Mars rocket.” 
Edkin nodded thoughtfully. 
“You sold them the design?” 

Croy shook his head. “Not out- 
right. But the royalties are— well, 


ample. I assure you that I can sup- 
port Mary Lynne in adequate 
style. And I should mention that 
the royalty contract rims for thir- 
ty years, with cost-of-living in- 
creases.” 

“Um.” Alden Edkin found that 
he was beginning to relax slightly. 
This Croy was, in his way, not 
without a certain charm. 

Edkin said in a warmer tone, 
“Well, money isn’t the only con- 
sideration. Still . Say, what 
about making some coffee, Mary 
Lynne? I’m sure our guest would 
enjoy it.” 

She looked at him in some sur- 
prise, shrugged, patted her pro- 
posed fiance’s arm and left the 
room. 

Edkin said, “I hope you won’t 
pay any attention to what Mary 
Lynne said about Aunt Nora.” 

“Of course not,” said Croy and 
smiled. He had a very nice smile. 
His eyes were deep-set, somber 
and serious, and the smile beneath 
them was like sunlight bursting 
out from under a cloud. 

Edkin was momentarily dazzled. 
He shook his head to clear it; for 
a second, he had almost thought 
he could see through the man. But 
that was nonsense. 

Croy was saying, “I don’t drink 
coffee, Mr. Edkin, but I’m glad 
Mary Lynne’s out of the room. I 
hope we can get better acquainted.” 

“Sure,” said Edkin testily. “Well, 
sit down and tell me something 


46 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


about yourself. Where was your 
family when you had one?” 
“We’re originally from Port- 
land, Mr. Edkin.” 

“Portland, Maine? Say, I was 
stationed near Presq’Isle when I 
was in the Army.” 

“No,” said Croy regretfully, 
“Portland, Oregon. After my par- 
ents passed away, I attended sev- 
eral schools, graduating from the 
University of California.” 

“Oh, we know lots of people 
there!” exclaimed Edkin. “Our 
cousins on my mother’s side have 
some friends who teach at Ber- 
keley. Perhaps you know them — 
Harold Sizeland and—” 

“Sorry,” Croy apologized. “I was 
at the Los Angeles campus. But 
let’s not talk about me, Mr. Edkin. 
Mary Lynne tells me you’re in 
credit maintenance.” 

“That’s right.” Actually he was 
a loan collector; it was close 
enough. 

/^ROY leaned confidentially 
closer. “You can help me, Mr. 
Edkin. I’m planning a sort of sur- 
prise for Mary Lynne.” 

“Surprise?” 

“Here,” said Croy, reaching into 
his pocket. He pulled out several 
sheets of legal cap, stapled into a 
blue folder. “Since you’re in the 
financial line,” he said, “you’ll know 
if this is all right. What it is, it’s a 
kind of trust agreement for Mary 
Lynne.” 


Edkin scowled. “You’re taking a 
lot for granted, Croy. I haven’t 
agreed to anything.” 

“Of course not. But won’t you 
look this over for me? You see, 
it puts all the royalties from my 
firing chamber in her name. Ir- 
revocably. So that if anything hap- 
pened to me, or there was, well, 
anything serious—” he didn’t say 
the word “divorce,” but he 
shrugged it — ” she’ll be well pro- 
vided for. I’d appreciate your 
opinion of the contract.” 

Edkin glanced at the papers 
suspiciously. 

He was ready to stand up and 
order from the house this brash 
young giant who interrupted his 
trivision programs and proposed to 
carry off his sister. But something 
hit him in the eye. And what that 
something happened to be was a 
neatly typed line specifying Mary 
Lynne’s guaranteed minimum an- 
nual income from the trust agree- 
ment. 

Thirty-five thousand dollars a 
year. 

Edkin swallowed. 

Attached to the certificate of 
agreement was a notarized copy 
of the Amalgamated Luna royalty 
contract. Unless it was a fake, the 
thirty-five-thousand-dollar figure 
was exactly right. 

Mary Lynne came back into the 
room, and nearly dropped the 
coffee tray. 

“Hi there, Mary Lynne!” greeted 


WE NEVER MENTION AUNT NORA

her brother, looking up from where 
he was patting Croy on the shoul- 
der. “Coffee, eh? Good!” 

She stared at him unbelievingly. 
He bobbed his head, winked con- 
spiratorially at Croy, jammed the 
papers in his pocket and stood 
up. 

“Coffee, eh?” he repeated, car- 
rying chairs toward the table. 
“Your young man won’t drink it, 
Mary Lynne. But surely he’ll have 
some cake, eh? Or a drink? Some 
tea? Perhaps a glass of chocolate 
milk — Mary Lynne will be glad 
to warm it. No?” 

He shrugged and sat down, 
smiling. “No matter,” he observed. 
“Now tell me. When would you 
two lovebirds like the happy event 
to take place?” 

nPHREE days later, the marriage 
was performed. It was the 
minimum legal waiting period. 

Alden Edkin, as it happened, 
was a bachelor who believed that 
every man who glanced at his sis- 
ter was a prospective rapist — and 
that those who proposed marriage 
were after her money besides. Still, 
he was not an idiot. 

He had taken certain precau- 
tions. 

First, he took a copy of the 
trust agreement to Mr. Senuto- 
vitch in his company’s legal de- 
partment. Mr. Senutovitch read 
the papers over with real enjoy- 
ment. 


“Ah, bully stuff, Edkin,” he said 
sentimentally. He leaned back and 
gazed at the ceiling while the arms 
of his reclining chair sighed faintly 
and adjusted to his position. “It’s a 
pleasure to read the work of a 
master.” 

“You think it’s all legal, Mr. 
Senutovitch?” 

“Legal?” Mr. Senutovitch 
coughed gently. “Did you notice 
the classic language of the oper- 
ative clause? That’s Paragraph 
Three: ‘Does hereby devise, grant, 
give, bestow and convey, without 
let or distraint, absolutely.’ Oh, it’s 
a grand piece of work.” 

“And irrevocable?” 

Mr. Senutovitch smiled. “Quite 
irrevocable.” 

“You’re sure, Mr. Senutovitch?” 
The lawyer said mildly, “Edkin, 
I wrote this company’s Chattel 
Lien Form. I’m sure.” 

The other precaution Edkin 
took was to drop into his com- 
pany’s Credit Reference Library 
and put through the name of Croy, 
James T., for a report. 

It would take a few days for 
the credit report to come through, 
and meanwhile the ceremony 
would be performed and the couple 
off on their honeymoon. But at 
least, Edkin consoled himself, when 
it did come through, it would be 
a comprehensive document. The 
company took an expansive view 
of what a credit report should 
cover. 


48 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


The company, moreover, was 
not to be deceived by any such 
paltry devices as a change of name 
—or, for that matter, of finger- 
prints, retinal patterns or blood 
type. If a man could change his 
basic genetic construction, he might 
fool the company, but not with 
anything less; the Credit Reference 
Library was hooked in by direct 
wire with the F.B.I. office in Wash- 
ington — for the convenience of 
the F.B.I., not of the company. 
There would be no secrets left to 
Mr. Croy. And therefore no secret 
worries for Alden Edkin. 

And then Edkin stood by, fight- 
ing a manly urge to weep, as his 
sweet young sister gave herself in 
wedlock to this white-haired giant 
with the deep, penetrating eyes. 
The ceremony was performed be- 
fore Father Hanover at Trinity 
Episcopal Church. There were few 
witnesses, though Mr. Senutovitch 
showed up, wrung the bridegroom’s 
hand warmly and left without a 
word. 

TN the empty house, Alden Ed- 
kin took a deep breath, let it 
out, and put through a phone call 
to their only surviving relative. It 
was the least he could do. 

A plump face over the fur col- 
lar of a lounging robe peered out 
of the phone’s screen at him. 

“Aunt Nora?” said Edkin tenta- 
tively. “My, you’re looking well.” 
“You lie,” she said shrilly. “I 


look old. What do you want? If it’s 
money, I won’t give you a—” 

“No, nothing like that, Aunt 
Nora.” 

“Then what? You sorry you 
threw me out of the house twenty 
years ago? Is that what you called 
up to say?” 

“Aunt Nora,” said Edkin boldly, 
“I say let bygones be bygones. I 
called you up to tell you the news 
about Mary Lynne— my sister— 
your niece.” 

“Well? Well? What about her?” 

“She just got married, Aunt 
Nora,” said Edkin, beaming. 

“What about it? People do, you 
know. There’s nothing strange.” 

Edkin was shocked. Such a lack 
of family feeling! And from her, 
who should feel herself Tucky be- 
yond imagining that anyone in the 
family called her up at all. He 
was angry enough to say what he 
had vowed he would never refer to. 

“At least,” he said icily, “she 
got married.” 

Pause. 

Thinly: “What do you mean by 
that?" 

“You know perfectly well, Aunt 
Nora.” 

In the tiny screen, her face was 
a doll’s face, an angry doll; it 
flushed red. She must have been 
shaking the phone, Edkin thought 
distractedly; rings of color haloed 
the edge of the screen. 

She cried, “You’re a sanctimoni- 
ous jerk, Alden Edkin! You for-

bade me to associate with your sis- 
ter— my own niece!— so I wouldn’t 
corrupt her . when she was three 
months old and the good Lord 
Himself couldn’t corrupt her, be- 
cause she didn’t so much as know 
which end was up! And now, just 
because she’s getting married, you 
call me up. Hoping, no doubt, 
that because I’m getting old and 
absent-minded, I’ll send along a 
little check for ten thousand dol- 
lars or so as a wedding present. 
Well, you’re wrong! If Mary 
Lynne wants to call me up, I’ll 
talk to her — but not to you! Un- 
derstand?” 

And the little screen flashed red 
and orange as she hung up. 

Edkin pushed down the off but- 
ton and shrugged. Aunt Nora! Who 
could account for her moods? A 
product of her sordid past, of 
course, but — It had been a mis- 
take to call her up. Definitely. 

Virtuously, Alden Edkin went to 
bed. 

The following morning, he got 
the report from the Credit Refer- 
ence Library. It had received spe- 
cial priority. The paper it was 
typed on flamed with warning red. 

A LDEN Edkin was waiting at 
the airfield when the honey- 
mooners returned from their Grand 
Tour. 

He had been champing at the 
bit for six weeks — sue long weeks 
and not a word from them, six 


weeks when they were out of touch 
with the world. Because they 
wanted it that way! 

It was Alden Edkin’s conviction 
that he knew why James Croy 
wanted it that way. He stood there 
by the customs gate, grinding his 
teeth, a plump angry man with a 
face that was rapidly turning 
purple. 

He saw them coming down the 
wheeled steps from the plane and 
he bawled, “Mary Lynne! Mary 
Lynne, come down here this 
minute! Get away from that mon- 
ster Croy!” 

Mary Lynne, her arm adoringly 
on the arm of her husband, shud- 
dered. “Oh-oh,” she muttered. 
“Storm clouds rising. Batten down 
all hatches.” 

Croy tsked solicitously. “Poor 
man, he’s upset, isn’t he? But you 
mustn’t worry.” 

“I’m not worried, darling.” 

“Of course not, of course not. 
Trust me.” Croy nodded approv- 
ingly. “I’ve got to stop off for a 
second. A little errand— But I’ll be 
right back and then I’m sure we 
can straighten out whatever’s 
troubling your brother.” Gently he 
kissed her ear. “My darling,” he 
whispered, soft as a moth’s wing. 

And then that perfect gentle- 
man, James Croy, bowed to the 
brother-in-law who was raging im- 
potently across the customs gate, 
turned on his heel and disappeared 
into the men’s room. 


WE NEVER MENTION AUNT NORA 


51 


The men’s room had a North 
Entrance, a South Entrance, a 
Mezzanine Entrance and a Service 
Entrance to the floor below. It is 
not a matter of record which door 
Croy used to come out, but it was 
not the one by which he had gone 
in. 

T HE policemen finally went 
away. “Sorry,” said the ser- 
geant, curt and somewhat bored— 
he had been with Missing Per- 
sons for a good long time. “Prob- 
ably he’ll turn up.” 

But it wasn’t true, and both he 
and Alden Edkin knew it And 
when he had left, Edkin told his 
sister what the red-bordered credit 
report had shown. 

Across the top was printed in 
bold letters Zero Credit Rating 
Zero. 

“You can’t fool Consolidated 
Credit,” snapped Edkin. “They 
know. And this man Croy — why, 
he’s a monster, Mary Lynne! He 
preys on women.” 

“Oh, no,” wept his sister. But 
she was already in her heart con- 
vinced. 

“Oh, yes! He is! Listen to this! 
Four years ago, in Miami, he mar- 
ried a girl named Doris L. Cock- 
ingham. There’s no record of a 
divorce! He just married her— set 
up a trust for her with the royal- 
ties from an electric underwater 
lung, left her pregnant and dis- 
appeared. Eh?” 


“I don’t believe you,” sobbed 
his sister. 

“Then listen to this! Eleven 
months later, in Troy, New York, 
he married Marsha Gutknecht. Re- 
volting! Can you understand a 
man like that? Loose morals, 
bigamy— why, he’d never get credit 
with a record like that” 

“There must be some perfectly 
simple explanation,” whimpered 
Mary Lynne. “When Jim comes 
back—” 

“He won’t be back!” said her 
brother brutally. “Get used to that 
idea, Mary Lynne! The Gutknecht 
woman never saw him again, and 
she was pregnant too. He meant 
to run away! He used false names. 
Told different stories to each of 
them. But he couldn’t fool Con- 
solidated Credit. He put four hun- 
dred thousand dollars in trust for 
this woman and took off and never 
gave her another thought. How do 
you like that, Mary Lynne?” 

“Jim wouldn’t-” 

“Jim did! And again the follow- 
ing year. Whitefish Bay, Wiscon- 
sin — a girl named Deloris Benny- 
hoff. Then in Jim Thorpe, Penn- 
sylvania—” He crumpled the paper 
in rage. “Ah, what’s the use? Five 
women! He married them, runs 
off, leaves them pregnant. And 
what do you have to say to that, 
Mary Lynne?” 

Mary Lynne looked at her 
brother through blurred eyes. 

In a faint, faint voice, she said,

“Well, at least he runs true to 
form, Alden.” 

they looked for him. But 
they couldn’t find him. The 
police couldn’t find him, private 
detectives couldn’t find him, even 
Consolidated Credit couldn’t find 
him. Jim Croy was gone — prob- 
ably forever, at least under that 
name. And while they were look- 
ing, events took their natural 
course, and Mary Lynne made 
reservations at the hospital and 
began to pack a little bag. 

And Aunt Nora phoned. 

Her plump face peered som- 
berly out of the phone screen. 
“I’m coming east,” she announced. 

“You’re not!” croaked Alden, 
wincing already. “I mean—” 

“Thursday,” she said. “On the 
six o’clock plane.” 

“But, Aunt Nora—” It was the 
last thing he wanted! So many 
years of cutting her out of the 
family circle because of the in- 
discretion of her youth, and now— 
“Meet me,” she said, and hung 
up. 

There was nothing to be done 
about it. Aunt Nora showed up at 
the house her sister had left the 
children just as Mary Lynne 
gasped, checked her wristwatch, 
gasped again and reached for her 
ready-packed bag. 

“Hello, Aunt Nora,” said Alden 
distractedly. “Mary Lynne, aren’t 
you ready yet? Good-by, Aunt 


Nora. Make yourself at home.” 

“Wait!” cried Aunt Nora, but 
she was talking to a closed door. 

She sighed, shook her head ir- 
ritably and took off her coat. Men 
were so foolish about babies! 
There would be plenty of time; 
she would unpack her bag, get set- 
tled in, and then, with full leisure, 
proceed to the hospital. And she 
was willing to bet that she would 
be there well before the baby ar- 
rived. 

She was right — though what 
she found in the upper bureau 
drawer of her room made her hur- 
ry to the hospital sooner than she’d 
planned. 

“Alden!” she gasped. “The pic- 
ture! I saw the picture — ” 

“Hello, Aunt Nora,” said Edkin 
gloomily. “Lord, but this takes a 
long time!” 

“It just seems long,” snapped 
Nora and waved a picture under 
his nose. It was inscribed in white 
ink: For Mary Lynne, from Jim- 
my, with love. “Who’s this?” 

Edkin said guiltily, “Mary’s — 
ah — husband. He’s away just 
now.” 

“I bet he is! That’s not any 
Jimmy! That’s Sam!” 

“Sam?” 

“My Sam. The one who left 
me in a delicate condition years 
ago! And the only difference is, 
now he marries them!” 

Alden, hardly listening, said 
soothingly, “That was a long time

ago, Aunt Nora. We don’t worry 
about it now. Besides, you gave 
the baby up for adoption, didn’t 
you? I never even saw him — or 
her? What was it, a boy?” 

She said shortly, “No.” 

“A girl, then.” 

“Guess again,” said Aunt Nora 
in a more peculiar tone. “And it 
wasn’t exactly adoption.” 

Her tone was peculiar enough 
to attract his full attention. He 
looked at her queerly, but she 
didn’t seem to be joking. Funny. 


He didn’t have the faintest idea 
of what she meant— 

Until an endless twenty minutes 
later. 

Until the white-faced nurse 
came out of the delivery room 
wheeling a bassinet; until, with- 
out a word, the nurse pointed a 
shaking finger, and Edkin saw 
what it was that his sister had — 
with the help of what called itself 
James Croy — brought into an 
unsuspecting world.

FORECAST 

One way to describe next month's novella, TO MARRY MEDUSA, is the 
way its author, Theodore Sturgeon, does: a pursestring plot that snaps shut 
at the end. But Sturgeon is a modest man and his is a too modest descrip- 
tion. What TO MARRY MEDUSA really is is a dazzling pattern of high- 
voltage wires with a shock at each connection — and a solar flare when 
the master switch is pulled. It has perhaps the most appallingly unlikely and 
bitterly unwilling hero in all literature, working for the most wrong-headed 
reasons on the wrongest possible side — to the problem that the human 
race is complex, it applies the absolutely literal answer: put the problem in 
a nutshell — and this is just the organization to do exactly that! 

Since this is an outsize novella, only one novelet can be scheduled 
for certain, though another may fit in somehow. In his novelet, Paul Flehr is 
forced to grant that every frontier in history was raw with violence, and 
that there is no basis for supposing interplanetary frontiers will be other- 
wise — but with fares so high and colonists so scarce, he refuses to concede 
that there is no alternative to killings and lynch law — for example, ruthless 
enforcement of the SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES. 

Short stories and features, to be sure, and Willy Ley gives, FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION, an intensive course on "How to Get Around on Other 
Planets." Some types of locomotion that have long gone unquestioned are 
given a very thorough questioning — and end up on the junkpile before 
they have a chance to do same to their crews. But Ley doesn't let his 
explorers walk back across alien landscapes; he provides transportation 
that may be somewhat startling but makes better sense.

feel somewhat like Phileas Fogg 
after his return to England, before 
he realizes, the useful mistake he 
made. Through the months of De- 
cember 1957 and January 1958, I 
was subjected to more than the 
customary number of radio, tele- 
vision and newspaper interviews, 
not to mention countless private 
questions. They all dealt with 
Vanguard, which had just suffered 
the most publicized failure of any 
rocket. 

What people wanted to know 

was: 

( 1 ) What happened to Van- 
guard? 

(2) Why was it publicized 
so much? 

(3) How many failures did 
the Russians have before 
they got Sputnik I into 
an orbit? 

(4) What were the chances 
of Jupiter? 

1VTY answers, naturally, were my 
own opinions and not those 
of the network or of the managing 
editor. And they ran as follows: 

Question No. 1. After having 
watched the films taken of the 
takeoff that miscarried, I felt my 
first impression on hearing the re- 
ports more or less confirmed. 

The films showed clearly that 
the rocket motor of the first stage 
burned well and that the rocket 
lifted. Just after lift-off, when it 
was roughly one yard above the 


launching table, something shot 
out of the tail and accompanied by 
flame; simultaneously, the exhaust 
blast of the motor seemed to 
weaken. It was not longer strong 
enough to carry the rocket, so the 
rocket settled back on its tail. 
Naturally it did not settle back 
to fit the launching table precise- 
ly. It split open, fell over and the 
fuel exploded. 

My first impression had been 
that the fuel pump was stuck and 
that this ruptured a fuel line. (This 
happened to several V-2s in Ger- 
many and to at least one V-2 at 
White Sands, but at a high alti- 
tude.) It has been stated officially 
since then that the cause of the 
mechanical failure is now known, 
but it has not been said officially 
what it was. At any event, it was 
a loss of power, just at the most 
critical moment, due to a mishap 
in the motor compartment. 

Question No. 2. The reason 
why Vanguard was publicized so 
much was paradoxically due to 
secrecy. As everyone knows, the 
Defense Department, during the 
years when Charles Wilson made 
all the many decisions stamped 
“I am twice as bright as anybody 
else,” suffered a very acute attack 
of juvenile super-secrecy. Nothing 
was to be published about missiles. 
Not even their names were to be 
made known — of course, you 
could always read British aviation 
publications and find out what you 


56 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


wanted to know — and, in general, 
the taxpayer was not to be in- 
formed what was done with his 
money. Or whether anything was 
done with his money. 

But it had also been decided 
that firing an artificial satellite by 
means of a military missile would 
“make a bad impression.” For this 
reason, Dr. Wemher von Braun’s 
original Project Orbiter was 
scrapped and “the peaceful 
rocket” of Project Vanguard was 
substituted. This put the first 
American satellite into space 
roughly two years later than 
would have been the case if Project 
Orbiter had gone ahead. 

But the other side of the coin 
was — hurray, hurray — that Van- 
guard was not a msisile. In fact, 
the Navy always referred to it 
very carefully as a “vehicle” and 
the Navy Public Relations officers 
then found out that most citizens 
considered a “vehicle” something 
in which a man rides. Hence they 
wanted to know what sort of man 
would ride the Vanguard. They 
wanted to know whether some- 
body had already been picked. 
And the Navy’s public relations 
men had to explain over and over 
again that the “passenger” was 
to be a ball of instruments weigh- 
ing 2 IV 2 pounds. 

r I ''O return to the theme: Van- 
guard was not a missile, so it 
was not classified. It could be 


talked about. Some technical detail 
was not revealed, but a newsman 
of any kind — radio, television or 
newspaper — who wanted to know 
something about rockets, since he 
had to fill time or space, would 
be waved into a chair and told: 
“Now you realize, of course, that 
missiles are under wraps. Missiles 
cannot, repeat NOT, be discussed. 
But the satellite project — Van- 
guard, that is — is not classified 
in that sense. So ask me anything 
you want about Vanguard and 
I’ll tell you.” 

Thus Vanguard, for about two 
years, got all the publicity that 
would normally have been spread 
over a dozen different projects. 
And since everybody had been 
whipped into expecting wonders of 
Vanguard, the disappointment was 
obviously severe. Under normal 
conditions, the failure would have 
been just a plain failure. Such 
things will happen; on to the next 
test. But only Vanguard had been 
talked about — and there were 
two Russian sputniki (that’s the 
correct plural) overhead. Which 
brings me to: 

Question No. 3. Of course the 
Russians, having an enormous 
land area, a political dictatorship 
and a secret police, could have hid- 
den any number of failures. But 
when asked directly whether the 
shot that put Sputnik I in orbit 
had been the first attempt, they 
said that it had been.

I may say here first that the sci- 
entists of all nations had been 
furnished with a date for the firing 
in about May 1957. The Russian 
rocket experts had started hinting 
very broadly that the year 1957 
was not only the beginning of the 
International Geophysical Year 
but also the centenary of the birth 
of the great Russian rocket pioneer 
Konstantin Eduardovitch Ziolkov- 
sky. Furthermore, they were plan- 
ning a celebration worthy of the 
memory of a rocket pioneer. 

The date was September 17, 
1957— when Ziolkovsky was born, 
the registrar noted his birthday 
down as September 5, 1857. But 
that was old style, the Julian 
calendar, and the Soviets have 
switched to the Gregorian calen- 
dar used by the rest of the world. 
So, to many people, the surprise 
was not that it happened at all, 
but that it did not happen on Sep- 
tember 17. I wondered for several 
months whether they had tried on 
September 17 and failed, or 
whether they simply did not get 
ready until October 4, the date of 
the actual shot. 

course I don’t know. But the 
Russians said that their first 
shot succeeded. Offhand, there is no 
reason why one should not believe 
this statement. They used a pro- 
duction missile, the one they call 
the T-2, which is a two-stage 
liquid-fuel job. They put a third 

58 


stage, almost certainly solid fuel, 
on top. In a production missile, 
the bugs which once inhabited it 
have been frozen or burned out 
before it became a production mis- 
sile. Hence, if it is in production, 
a failure would be a surprise rather 
than the other way round. It was 
this reasoning which caused me 
to be very optimistic about: 

Question No. 4. The Jupiter-C 
missile is a production missile too. 
At least its components are. The 
first stage of the Jupiter-C is a 
Redstone liquid-fuel rocket. The 
second stage is a ring-shaped clus- 
ter of a well-tested solid-fuel 
rocket, called Recruit (because it 
is a scaled-down Sergeant). The 
third stage is a smaller cluster of 
Recruit rockets placed inside the 
ring-shaped cluster which is the 
second stage. The fourth stage, 
finally, is a single such rocket, sit- 
ting more or less on top of the 
third stage. 

So I assured everybody who 
asked me that Jupiter would jump 
into space in January. Naturally I 
felt like Phileas Fogg on January 
31st. Then I was rescued like 
Phileas Fogg. Jupiter did jump 
into space, still in January. The 
takeoff time was 10:48 P.M. A 
wire service rang me up at a few 
minutes after midnight to tell me 
about it. And on the following day, 
I sent a wire to Wehrner von 
Braun, congratulating him and 
thanking him for having kept me

an honest man by the margin of 
one hour and twelve minutes. 

Of course, during the time that 
goes by between the writing of 
this column and its appearance 
on the newsstands, you must have 
read about all the things that Ex- 
plorer did find out. I just want 
to point at one early item, its in- 
ternal temperature. 

The space travel men had said 
for years that the temperature in 
the cabin of a spaceship near Earth 
would be about 70 degrees Fah- 
renheit. This figure was based on 
heat received from the Sun only 
and did not take into account how 
much additional heat would be 
generated internally by hot fila- 
ments in instruments and bv the 
people. It also did not take into 
account the heat the ship would 
receive by reflection from the 
Earth when it was above the day- 
side of the Earth — between Earth 
and Sun, that is. Calculated in, 
this was expected to add between 
twelve and fifteen degrees. 

Explorer has reported that its 
internal temperature varies from 
50 degrees to 85 degrees Fahren- 
heit. Accurate predicting, eh? 

"OUT let’s go on to other IGY 
activities now. And this time 
we really talk about the first six 
months because no later reports 
are in. 

It must be said that Nature co- 
operated beautifully. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


The first day of the IGY was 
July 1, 1957. 

On June 28, 1957, there was an 
exceptionally large solar flare. The 
disturbance caused by that flare 
reached the Earth on the first of 
July. 

Light from a solar flare needs 
only eight minutes to reach the 
Earth. Astronomers of Krasnaya 
Pakhra Observatory in Russia saw 
the flare first and reported it to 
IGY headquarters in Brussels. 
IGY headquarters declared an 
“alert” one day before the official 
beginning of the IGY. The dis- 
turbance caused by a solar flare 
shows mostly as a disruption of 
long-range radio communications. 

Normally there are several 
ionized layers in the ionosphere 
(above 40 miles from the ground) 
which are used as “mirrors” to re- 
flect radio waves of different wave 
lengths from the point of origin 
to the target. After a solar flare, 
this does not work for a while. The 
radio waves do not come back. 
Were they simply let out into space 
or were they absorbed? The latter 
was more likely by far, but one 
could not be absolutely certain. 

On July 4, 1957, a research 
rocket was fired through the ion- 
ized layers to find out. The rocket 
reported that there was an addi- 
tional ionized layer, extending to 
twelve miles below the lowest nor- 
mal layer. The rocket also re- 
ported that there were no changes 

59 


in the distribution of the ionized 
layers otherwise. The disruption of 
communications was due to the 
temporary formation of this extra' 
layer, below all the others. At a 
later solar flare — to the eye, a 
solar flare is just an exceptionally 
bright spot on the face of the Sun 

— another rocket could establish 
that the extra layer was caused 
by X-rays coming from the Sun. 

One of the things which scien- 
tists had never been able to an- 
swer was whether there was a 
“bipolarity of the auroras.” Every- 
body has seen pictures of an au- 
rora. If they occur near the mag- 
netic pole in the north, they are 
called aurora borealis; if they oc- 
cur near the opposite pole, they 
are called aurora australis. Now 
the auroras, all available evidence 
said, were also caused by solar ac- 
tivities. But if it was the Sun that 
caused an aurora, it should take 
place simultaneously at both poles 

— it should be “bipolar.” 

All very logical, but was it? 

The difficulty was that one pole 
has daylight when it is night at 
the other pole. You probably could 
not see an aurora in bright sun- 
light, increased by the glare from 
the snow on the ground, even if 
one took place. Moreover, you 
never had observers both in the 
far north and in the far south at 
the same moment. 

But, during the IGY, you do 
have observers all over. And they 

60 


were aided by new instrumentation 
which would have sounded like 
magic in the days of Nansen. Now 
proven: the aurorae are bipolar. 

71/1 UCH attention was devoted 
to something that few people 
even knew existed, the so-called 
“whistlers.” The whistler can be 
heard only with radio equipment; 
it is one more radio disturbance, 
this time of the low frequencies. 

The origin of a whistler seems 
to be a stroke of lightning. The 
Earth is large enough for about 
a thousand thunderstorms to go 
on at any given moment, so there 
is no shortage of lightning strokes. 
But obviously not every stroke 
produces a whistler. Only occa- 
sionally is the wave which is 
originated by the lightning capable 
of penetrating the reflecting ion- 
ized layers of the upper atmos- 
phere. 

When one does, the resulting 
and rather faint disturbance travels 
back and forth between the north- 
ern and the southern hemisphere. 
It travels in space, outside the 
ionosphere, and it does go very 
far out, judging by the time that 
elapses. The whistlers must travel 
along the so-called magnetic lines; 
more precisely speaking, they 
travel through an arc along which 
the intensity of the Earth’s mag- 
netic field remains the same. 

Could the “whistler effect” be 
used for communications at times 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


when solar flares produce this 
extra layer which ruins the cus- 
tomary method of radio communi- 
cation? There is no answer to this 
question yet, but by the end of 
the IGY we may know. 

Still staying at the fringes of 
the atmosphere, another phenom- 
enon has to be discussed. The two 
principal gases of our atmosphere 
are nitrogen, not quite 80 per cent, 
and oxygen, around 21 per cent. 
The little difference indicated by 
the words “not quite” is argon, 
neon, krypton, xenon, helium and 
hydrogen, all together amounting 
to roughly one per cent. On oc- 
casion, you can read somewhat dif- 
ferent figures; for some purposes, 
it is more convenient to list the 
weight rather than the volume. 
Here is a comparison of both: 



volume

Argon, etc 

.94 

1.292

.03 

.046 

Hydrogen

.001 


The point this table makes is 
that the various gases have dif- 
ferent specific gravities. A cubic 
yard of oxygen does not weigh 
quite the same as a cubic yard of 
nitrogen. A cubic yard of hydrogen 
would be much lighter than either, 
and a cubic yard of carbon dioxide 
much heavier than anything else 


that exists in the atmosphere. 

If the atmosphere were, or could 
be, completely at rest, the various 
gases could be expected to sep- 
arate into layers. Of course the 
atmosphere is not at rest; it is 
warmed by the Sun on one side 
and radiates its heat into space on 
the other. It circulates, mixes and 
travels about. 

O RIGINALLY the idea of sep- 
arate layers just did not exist. 
But some sixty years ago, when 
more about the higher levels of 
the atmosphere became known by 
way of balloon flights, it suddenly 
looked as if all the turbulence was 
confined to the first six miles or 
so. The French scientist Leon P. 
Teisserenc de Bort even coined the 
name stratosphere for the “upper 
air” because up there the air 
seemed to be stratified. 

Some years later, between 1915 
and 1925, you could find neat 
diagrams of the atmosphere, all 
based on the idea that the gases 
should separate according to their 
specific gravity. No layer would 
be perfectly pure, but as you went 
up the percentage of helium should 
increase, for example, and the per- 
centage of hydrogen with it. In 
fact, there probably was one pure 
layer, namely an outer hydrogen 
layer. 

Here we had a case of logical 
reasoning which did not seem to 
hold true in reality, for the first

V-2 rockets thoroughly ruined the 
whole concept. Eighty miles up, 
the composition of the atmosphere 
was still the same as near the 
ground. Naturally the density had 
dropped to almost nothing, but 
the composition of the little there 
was corresponded with what you 
could measure one mile up. No 
layering. 

This dictum was firm and defi- 
nite as of January 1, 1957. On 
January 1, 1958, it was not so firm 
any more. An IGY research rocket, 
fired from Fort Churchill in Can- 
ada in late summer 1957, carried 
a device for analyzing the compo- 
sition of the air. The still some- 
what tentative result is that the 
air is completely mixed up to sixty 
miles. But above sixty miles there 
were faint indications of separa- 
tion according to the specific gravi- 
ty of the gases involved. 

The attempt to measure this 
brought up the question of what 
is “normal” density at high alti- 
tudes. A series of Aerobee and 
Nike-Cajun rockets was fired from 
Fort Churchill for just this pur- 
pose. The rockets, going as high 
as 120 miles, reported all kinds of 
effects which could not be detected 
on the ground. 

It seems that one cannot ask 
about the “normal” density a hun- 
dred miles up without specifying 
quite a number of things. This 
density is not the same during the 
day and the night. It is not the 


same on the first of August and the 
first of December. And it is not the 
same, on the same day, under 30 
degrees of northern latitude and 
under 60 degrees of northern lati- 
tude. 

Density of the atmosphere at 
very high altitudes, then, is influ- 
enced by the geographical latitude, 
the season of the year and, most 
especially, the time of the day. 

L ET’S come out of the atmos- 
phere now and put our feet 
on the ground. Or rather on the 
ice, because we have to talk about 
Antarctica next. Even though Ant- 
arctica is almost “settled” by IGY 
stations (I count 38 on my check- 
map, run by, in alphabetical order, 
Argentina, Australia, Chile, Eng- 
land, France, Japan, New Zealand, 
Norway, USA and USSR), the 
results must be spotty, for the 
Antarctic ice sheet measures six 
million square miles. 

A number of soundings have 
shown that the ice extends to be- 
low sea level where “land” was 
expected. Still, the experts are 
careful not to conclude that Ant- 
arctica is really an archipelago 
which is tied together by ice. The 
drilling may just conceivably have 
hit a frozen fjord. 

The geography of Antarctica is 
still quite uncertain, but we are 
making progress. But the end of 
the IGY, we may have a reason- 
ably good map. Or at least one 


62 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


that is good enough to serve as a 
guide to further studies. 

Something quite unexpected has 
shown up at the other end of the 
globe, the polar sea. Several sta- 
tions in the western hemisphere are 
involved, most of them Canadian, 
one or two Norwegian, one Ameri- 
can. The stations on the other side 
of the Arctic Ocean are Russian, 
of course. 

One day, one of the Canadians 
noticed a sea level rise of about 
four inches which could not be ac- 
counted for by tides or anything 
known. He first checked with his 
colleagues in the western hemi- 
sphere. Yes, they had observed it 
too. Then they checked with the 
Russians, who had looked at the 
same thing with amazement. But 
there was a difference in time. The 
sea level rise on the Russian side 
did not take place at the same time 
as it did on the American side. 

The phenomenon may be com- 
pared with the motion of the water 
in a round washtub that has been 
shaken. The water first laps up 
on one side and then travels to 
the opposite side. Then it comes 
back. Naturally it takes many 
hours for a basin as large as the 
Arctic Ocean. 

Nobody has any idea of how 
this can be explained. The main 
problem is that it is a newly ob- 
served phenomenon. We don’t 
know whether it existed in the past. 
We don’t know whether it was 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 


stronger in the past or weaker. 
If we knew when it started, it 
might tie up with a major vol- 
canic catastrophe. But we don’t 
know. It is something to be 
watched for a long time to come. 

Another surprise that turned up 
in the oceans — in the Atlantic 
Ocean, in this case — is something 
that might be called a Counter 
Gulf Stream. 

The work was done by two 
oceangoing laboratories, the Atlan- 
tis (U. S. A.) and the Discovery 
II (Great Britain). They inves- 
tigated the eastern edge of the 
Gulf Stream which flows in a 
general northeasterly direction. 
They found that, at a depth of 
6500 feet below the Gulf Stream’s 
eastern edge, the water either 
shows no movement at all or else 
that the movement is very erratic, 
the equivalent of a turbulent zone 
in the air. But at 9000 feet there 
is a current flowing opposite to 
the Gulf Stream on top, at the rate 
of eight miles per hour, which is 
rather fast for an ocean current. 

TVT OTHING on such a scale has 
” yet been reported from the 
southern Atlantic Ocean, which is 
under investigation by the Verna 
(U. S. A.) and the Bahia Blanca 
(Argentina). But the Verna could 
report something new in the bio- 
logical field. They recovered — 
alive — a small shellfish and a 
worm one-quarter of an inch in 

63 


length from depths of 13,200 and 
16,200 feet, respectively. This is 
believed to be the greatest depth 
from which living organisms have 
been brought up so far, alive or 
dead. 

About 200 IGY stations occupy 
themselves with measuring sea 
level and tides. It is possible that, 
with the change of the seasons, 
very large amounts of sea water 
shift from the northern to the 
southern hemisphere. But, so far, 
only one change of seasons has 
been observed and that incom- 
pletely. Which is, incidentally, the 
reason why the IGY runs through 
eighteen months— all observations 
can be made through overlapping 
seasons. 

Well, this is about what is now 
known. The full results of the IGY 
will not even be known at the end 
of the IGY because it will take 
years to correlate all the informa- 
tion gathered and to interpret it 
correctly. 

It is quite possible that impor- 


tant discoveries have already been 
made, needing only time and study 
to be found and confirmed. 

Both in the Arctic and in Ant- 
arctica, long “cores”— samplings of 
ice from great depths— have been 
taken. The forty-odd research ves- 
sels engaged in the program have 
taken large quantities of samples 
of bottom mud from all the oceans. 
Observatories, stations, ships, rock- 
ets, balloons, instruments and hu- 
man watchers are amassing moun- 
tains of data that must be broken 
down, analyzed, tested, compared, 
checked and rechecked. And some, 
like the photographs of Pluto made 
years ago, will have to wait for 
theory to point the way to their 
true significance. 

There is no way of prophesying 
how many scientific papers and 
books in the future will begin with 
the words: “It was first noticed 
during the IGY that . .” but it’s 
certain that the number will not 
be small.

EAR Miss Dix VI: 

I have a problem. In 
spite of rumors to the con-

married, and were perfectly nor- 
mal people at the time I was born. 
And so was I — normal, I mean. 
But that all contributed to the

me resolve it, but you have helped 
so many others that I am willing to

this letter in your column; write 
me privately, please. 

You know all about me, of 
course. Who doesn’t? But most

So I will have to clarify my back- 
ground before I present my prob- 
lem.

I imagine, that I would be writ- 
ing a letter to Miss Dix VI. After 
all, in spite of the tax rate, I am 
one of the richest — I will say it! 
— one of the richest men in the 
world. 

Every word of that last state- 
ment is true. My parents were 
enormously wealthy, but I have 
accumulated even more of the 
world’s goods than they ever did. 
And if they had not been loaded 
with loot, I would not be here now 
to be writing this letter to you. 

Please excuse any lack of 
smoothness in the style and execu- 
tion of this letter. I’m doing this 
all myself. Usually I dictate to a 
secretary — a live secretary — but 
you understand that that would 
not be advisable for a letter of this 
kind, I’m sure. 

S O. My background. I was born 
in 2352 and, having passed 
my infantile I.Q. test with flying 
colors, was admitted to the Har- 
vard Creche for Superior Children 
at the usual age of three months. 

The name of Alfred Vanderform 
naturally had been entered on the 
rolls much earlier. Ten years ear- 
lier, in point of fact My parents 
had been fortunate enough to be 
selected to have three children and 
I was to be their first. They chose 
to begin with a son. They had 
known that they would be chosen, 
and that I would be a superior 
child, and had taken the wise pre- 


caution of signing me up for Har- 
vard Creche as soon as the plan- 
ners had finished drawing up their 
preliminary charts. 

In spite of what you may have 
heard, there was absolutely no 
chance of falsifying the initial I.Q. 
examination; in those days, at 
least. I was a physically normal, 
mentally superior child. My prog- 
ress at the creche was entirely 
satisfactory. I was an ordinarily 
above-average genius in every way. 

At age six, I left the creche for 
my sabbatical year at home with 
my parents, and it was there that 
my first disaster occurred. 

My mother and father moved 
into the same house while I was 
there, which was the custom then 
(and may still be, for all I know) 
in order to provide a proper home- 
like atmosphere for me. Through 
some carelessness in original plan- 
ning, this was also the year that 
had been selected for the birth of 
their second child, which was to 
be a girl. Both parents were to 
be the same for all three of their 
children. Under usual circum- 
stances, they would have paid 
enough attention to me so that the 
disaster would never have been al- 
lowed to take place, but plans for 
their second child must have made 
them a trifle careless. 

At any rate, in spite of my early 
age, an embolism somehow devel- 
oped and major damage to my 
heart resulted. It was here that the 


66 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


great wealth of my parents proved 
invaluable. 

Prognosis was entirely unfavor- 
able for me. The routine proced- 
ure for a three-offspring couple 
would have been to cancel the un- 
successful quota and reissue it for 
immediate production. However, it 
was too late to arrange for twins 
in their second quota and my par- 
ents decided to attempt to' salvage 
me. 

An artificial heart was prepared 
and substituted for the original. It 
had a built-in atomic battery which 
would require renovation no 
oftener than every twenty years. 
Voluntary control was provided 
through connection with certain 
muscles in my neck, and I soon 
learned to operate it as least as 
efficiently as a normal heart with 
the normal involuntary controls. 

T HE mechanism was consider- 
ably bigger than the natural 
organ, but the salvage operation 
was a complete success. The bulge 
between my shoulder blades for 
the battery and the one in front 
of my chest for the pump were 
not excessively unsightly. I en- 
tered the Princeton Second Stage 
Creche for Greatly Superior Chil- 
dren on time, being accepted with- 
out objection in spite of my pseu- 
do-deformity. 

It cannot be proved that any 
special emolument was offered to 
or accepted by the creche man- 


agers in order to secure my ac- 
ceptance. My personal belief is 
that nobody had to cough up. 

Three years at Princeton passed 
relatively uneventfully for me. In 
spite of the best efforts and assur- 
ances of the creche psychologists, 
there was naturally a certain lack 
of initial acceptance of me by 
some of my creche mates. How- 
ever, they soon became accus- 
tomed to my fore-and-aft bulges, 
and since I had greater endurance 
than they, with voluntary control 
over my artificial heart, I even- 
tually gained acceptance, and even 
a considerable measure of leader- 
ship — insofar as leadership by an 
individual is possible in a creche. 

Shortly after the beginning of 
my fourth year at the Princeton 
Creche, the second great personal 
disaster struck. 

Somehow or other — the cause 
has not been determined to this 
day — my artificial heart went on 
the blink. I did not quite die im- 
mediately, but the prognosis was 
once again entirely unfavorable. 
Considerable damage had some- 
how eventuated to my lungs, my 
liver and my kidneys. I was a 
mess. 

By this time, my parents had 
made such a huge investment in 
me, and my progress reports had 
been so uniformly excellent, that 
in spite of all the advice from the 
doctors, they determined to at- 
tempt salvage again.

A COMPLETE repackaging job 
was decided upon. Blood was 
to be received, aerated, purified 
and pumped back to the arterial 
system through a single mecha- 
nism which would weigh only 
about thirty-five pounds. Of course, 
this made portability an important 
factor. Remember that I was only 
ten years old. I could probably 
have carried such a weight around 
on my back, but I could never 
have engaged in the proper devel- 
opment of my whole body and 
thus could never have been ac- 
cepted back again by Princeton. 

It was therefore determined to 
put the machinery into a sort of 
cart, which I would tow around 
behind me. Wheels were quickly 
rejected as being entirely unsatis- 
factory. They would excessively 
inhibit jumping, climbing and 
many other boyish activities. 

The manufacturers finally de- 
cided to provide the cart with a 
pair of legs. This necessitated ad- 
ditional machinery and added 
about twenty-five pounds to the 
weight of the finished product. 
They solved the problem of how 
I would handle the thing with great 
ingenuity by making the primary 
control involuntary. They provided 
a connection with my spinal cord 
so that the posterior pair of legs, 
unless I consciously ordered other- 
wise, always followed in the foot- 
steps of the anterior pair. If I ran, 
they ran. If I jumped, they jumped. 


In order to make the connec- 
tion to my body, the manufac- 
turers removed my coccyx and 
plugged in at and around the end 
of my spinal column. In other 
words, I had a very long and 
rather flexible tail, at the end of 
which was a smoothly streamlined 
flesh-colored box that followed me 
around on its own two legs. 

A human has certain normally 
atrophied muscles for control of 
his usually non-existent tail. 
Through surgery and training, 
those muscles became my volun- 
tary controllers for my tail and the 
cart. That is, I could go around 
waggin’ my tail while draggin’ my 
wagon. 

Pardon me, Miss Dix VI. That 
just slipped out 

W ELL, the thing actually 
worked. You should have 
seen me in a high hurdle race — 
me running along and jumping 
over the hurdles, with that contrap- 
tion galloping along right behind 
me, clearing every hurdle I cleared. 
I kept enough slack in my tail so 
I wouldn’t get pulled up short, 
and then just forgot about it. 

Going off a diving board was a 
little bit different. I learned to do 
things like that with my back legs 
under voluntary control. 

Speaking of diving boards, may- 
be you wonder how I could swim 
while towing a trailer. No trouble 
at all. I would just put my tail

between my legs and have my cart 
grab me around the waist with a 
kind of body scissors. The cart’s 
flexible air sac was on its top when 
it was in normal position, so this 
held it away from my body, where 
it would not get squeezed. I would 
take in just enough air so that it 
was neutrally buoyant, and with 
its streamlined shape, it didn’t 
slow me down enough to notice. 

I usually “breathed” — or took 
in my air — through the intakes of 
the cart, and they stayed under 
water, but there was an air con- 
nection through my tail up to the 
lung cavity anyway, allowing me 
to talk. So I just breathed through 
my mouth in the old-fashioned 
way. 

Backing up was rather a prob- 
lem, with my posterior legs lead- 
ing the way, and dancing was near- 
ly impossible until I got the idea 
of having my trailer climb up out 
of the way onto my shoulders 
while I danced. That got me by 
Princeton’s requirements, but I 
must confess that I was never very 
much in demand as a dancing part- 
ner. 

At any rate, that system got me 
through to my sixth and last year 
at Princetoi^I sometimes believe 
that I may be considered to be 
what is occasionally called an “ac- 
cident-prone.” I seem to have had 
more than my share of tough 
luck. During my last year at 
Princeton, I got my throat cut. 

70 


It was an accident, of course. 
No Princeton man would ever 
dream of doing away with some- 
one he had taken a dislike to quite 
so crudely. Or messily. 

T> Y voluntary control of my 
heart, I slowed the action 
down to the point where I man- 
aged to keep from bleeding to 
death, but my larynx was de- 
stroyed beyond repair. That was 
when I got my Voder installation. 
It fitted neatly where my lungs 
used to be, and because it used 
the same resonant cavities, I soon 
learned to imitate my own voice 
well enough so that nobody could 
tell the difference, “before” or 
“after.” 

Actually, it was a minor acci- 
dent, but I thought I’d mention it 
because of what the news media 
sometimes call my “inhuman 
voice.” It even enables me to sing, 
something I never was much good 
at before that accident. Also, I 
could imitate a banjo and sing at 
the same time, a talent that made 
me popular at picnics. 

That was the last real accident 
I had for quite a while. I got 
through my second (and last) 
home sabbatical, my Upper School, 
my First College and my Second 
College. I was chosen for, and got 
through, Advanced College with 
highest honors. Counting sabbati- 
cals, that took a total of twenty- 
nine years, plus the last of my 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


time at Princeton. And then, an 
eager youth of forty-two, I was on 
my own — ready to make my way 
in the world. 

I was smart to avoid the gov- 
ernment service that catches so 
many of us so-called super-gen- 
iuses. It’s very satisfying work and 
all that, I suppose, but there’s no 
money in it, and I was rich enough 
to want to get richer. 

The cart containing my organs 
didn’t get in my way too much. 
With my athletic days behind me, 
I taught it to come to heel instead 
of striding along behind me. It was 
less efficient, but it was a lot less 
conspicuous. I had a second in- 
voluntary control system built in 
so it would stay at heel without 
conscious thought on my part, 
once I put it there. 

In my office, I would have it 
curl up at my feet like a sleeping 
dog. People told me it was hardly 
noticeable — even people who 
didn’t work for me. It certainly 
didn’t bother me or hold me back. 
I started to make money as though 
I had my own printing press and 
managed to hang onto most of it. 

TN spite of what the doom criers 
say, as long as there is an 
element of freedom in this coun- 
try — and I think there always will 
be — there will be ways, and I 
mean legal ways, of coming into 
large hunks of cash. Within ten 
years, I was not only Big Rich; I 


was one of the most important peo- 
ple in the world. A Policy Maker. 
A Power. 

It was about that time that I 
drank the bottle of acid. 

Nobody was trying to poison 
me. I wasn’t trying to kill myself, 
either. Not even subconsciously. 
I was just thirsty. All I can say 
is I did a first rate job with what 
was left of my insides. 

Well, they salvaged me again, 
and what I ended up with was a 
pair of carts, one trotting along be- 
side each heel. The leash for the 
second one was plugged into me in 
front instead of in the back, natu- 
rally, but with my clothes on, no- 
body could tell, just by looking, 
that they were attached to me at 
all. 

The doctors offered to get me 
by without the second trailer. They 
figured they could prepare pre-di- 
gested food and introduce it into 
my bloodstream through the 
mechanism of my original wagon. 
I refused to let them; I had gotten 
too used to eating. 

So whatever I ate was ground 
up and pumped into my new 
trailer — or should it be “pre- 
ceder”? There it would be 
processed and the nutriments 
passed into my bloodstream as re- 
quired. I couldn’t overeat if I 
tried. It was all automatic, not 
even hooked into my nervous sys- 
tem. Unusable products were com- 
pressed and neatly packaged for 


MAN IN A QUANDARY 


71 


disposal at any convenient time. 
In cellophane. There was, of 
course, interconnection inside of 
me between the two carts. 

I’m told I started quite a fad for 
walking dogs in pairs. It didn’t af- 
fect me at all. I never got very 
good at voluntary control of my 
second trailer, but by that time my 
habit patterns were such that I 
hardly noticed it. 

Oh, yes — about swimming. I 
still enjoyed swimming and I 
worked it out this way: Wagon 
number two replaced number one 
in straddling me, and wagon num- 
ber one hung onto number two. 
It slowed me down, but it still let 
me swim. I quit diving. I couldn’t 
spare the time to figure out how 
to manage it. 

r | ’HAT took care of the next 
five years. I kept on getting 
richer. I was a happy man. Then 
came the crowning blow. What 
was left of me developed cancer. 

It attacked my brain, among 
other things. And it was inoper- 
able. It looked as if I had only a 
couple of years before deteriora- 
tion of my mental powers set in, 
and then it would be the scrap 
heap for me. 

But I didn’t give up. By that 
time, I had gotten used to the 
parts-replacement program. And I 
was very rich. So I told them to 
get busy and build me an artifi- 
cial brain as good as my own. 


They didn’t have time to make 
a neat package job this time. They 
took over three big buildings in 
the center of town and filled them 
with electronics. You should see 
the cable conduits connecting those 
buildings together! Then they 
bought the Broadway Power 
Plant and used most of its output. 
They ran in new water mains to 
provide the coolant. 

They used most of my money, 
and it took all of my influence to 
speed things up, but they got the 
job done in time. 

It won’t do you any good to 
ask me how they transferred my 
memories and my personality to 
that mass of tubes and wires and 
tapes and transistors. I don’t know. 
They tell me that it was the easiest 
part of the job, and I know that 
they did it perfectly. My brain 
power and my personality came 
through unchanged. I used them to 
get rich again in mighty short 
order. I had to, to pay my water 
and power bills. 

I came out of it “Alfred the 
Magnificent” and still I’m just as 
human as you are, even if a lot 
of people — a few billions of them, 
I guess — won’t believe it. Granted, 
there isn’t much of the Original 
Me left, but there’s an old saying 
that Glands Make the Man. Un- 
derneath it all, I’m the same Alfred 
Vanderform, the same old ordinary 
super-genius that I have always 
been.

I have almost finished with the 
background material, Miss Dix VI, 
and am nearly ready to present 
you my problem. I am now ap- 
proaching the age of sixty — and 
have therefore reached the time 
of Selection for Fatherhood. I 
have, in fact, been fortunate 
enough to be one of the few se- 
lected to father three children. 

IF you have chanced to hear 
-*■ rumors that money changed 
hands in getting me selected, let 
me tell you that they are entire- 
ly true. The only thing wrong 
about the rumors is that none of 
them has named a big enough 
amount — not nearly big enough. 
It isn’t that I don’t qualify by any 
honest evaluation. I do. But there 
has been a good deal of prejudice 
against me as a Father, and even 
some skepticism about my capa- 
bility. But that doesn’t matter; 
what does is that I have been se- 
lected. 

What is more, a single superior 


female was chosen to be Mother 
of all three of my children. By 
what is not at all a coincidence, 
this woman happens to be my 
private secretary. She is, I may 
add, very beautiful. 

I am just old-fashioned enough 
to want my children to have all 
of the advantages that I had my- 
self, including parents who are 
fully married, in the same way that 
my own mother nad father were. 
Legal ceremony— religious service 
—everything! 

So I have asked the chosen 
mother of my children-to-be to 
marry me, and Gloria — that’s her 
name — has been gracious enough 
to accept. We are to be married 
week after next. 

Now, Miss Dix VI, we come to 
my problem. How can I tell if 
Gloria is in love with me, or is 
just marrying me for my money?

Bullet With His Name 

By FRITZ LEIBER 


Illustrated By: DILLON 

T HE Invisible Being shifted 
his anchorage a bit in 
Earth’s gravitational field, 
which felt like a push rather than 
a pull to him, and said, “This 
featherless biped seems to satisfy 
Galaxy Center’s requirements. I’d 
say he’s a suitable recipient for 
the Gifts.” 


His Coadjutor, equally invisible 
and negatively massed, chewed 
that over. “Mature by his length 
and mass. Artificial plumage 
neither overly gaudy nor utterly 
drab — indicating median social 
level, which is confirmed by the 
size of his bachelor nest. Inward

tastically inaccurate. Feelings rea- 
sonably meshed — at least neither 
volcanic nor frozen. Thoughts and 
values in reasonable order. Yes, I 
agree, a satisfactory test subject. 
Except ...” 

“Except what?” 

“Except we can never be sure 
of that ‘reasonable’ part.” 


“Of course not! Thank' your 
stars that’s beyond the reach of 
Galaxy Center’s keenest telepathy, 
or even ours on the spot. Otherwise 
you and I’d be out of a job.” 

“And have to scheme up some 
other excuse for free-touring the 
Cosmos with backtracking per- 
mitted.” 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


75 


“Exactly!” The Being and his 
Coadjutor understood each other 
very well and were the best of 
friends. “Well, how many Gifts 
would you suggest for the test?” 

“How about two Little and one 
Big?” the Coadjutor ventured. 

“Umm . statistically adequate 
but spiritually unsatisfying. Re- 
member, the fate of his race hangs 
on his reactions to them. I’d be 
inclined to increase your sugges- 
tion by one each and add a 
Great” 

“No— at least I question the last. 
After all, the Great Gifts aren’t as 
important, really, as the Big Gifts. 
Besides ...” 

“Besides what? Come on, spit it 
out!” The Invisible Being was the 
bluff, blunt type. 

“Well,” said his less hearty but 
unswervingly honest companion, 
“I’m always afraid that you’ll use 
the granting of a Great Gift as an 
excuse for some sardonic trick— 
that you’ll put a sting in its tail.” 

“And why shouldn’t I, if I want 
to? Snakes have stings in their 
tails (or do they on this planet?) 
and I’m a sort of snake. If he fails 
the test, he fails. And aren’t both 
of us malicious, plaguing spirits, 
eager to knock holes in the inward 
armor of provincial entities? It’s 
in the nature of our job. But we 
can argue about that in due course. 
What Little Gifts would you sug- 
gest?” 

“That’s something I want to 


talk about. Many of the Little 
Gifts are already well within his 
race’s reach, if not his. After all, 
they’ve already got atomic power.” 
“Which as you very well know 
scores them nothing one way or the 
other on a Galaxy Center test. 
We’re agreed on the nature and 
the number of our Gifts — three 
Little, two Big, and one Great?” 
“Yes,” his Coadjutor responded 
resignedly. 

“And we’re agreed on our sub- 
ject?” 

“Yes to that too.” 

“All right, then, let’s get started. 
This isn’t the only solar system we 
have to visit on this circuit.” 

E RNIE Meeker — of Chicago, 
Illinois, U.S. of A., Occident, 
Terra, Sol, Starswarm 37, Rim 
Sector, Milky Way Galaxy — 
rubbed his chin and slanted across 
the street to a drugstore. 

“Package of blades. Double edge. 
Five. Cheapest.” 

At one point during the trans- 
action, the clerk lost sight of the 
tiny packet he’d placed on the 
coin-whitened glass between them. 
He gave a suspicious look, as if 
the customer had palmed them. 

Ernie blinked. After a moment, 
he pointed toward the center of the 
counter. 

“There they are,” he said, drop- 
ping a coin beside them. 

The clerk’s face didn’t get any 
less suspicious. Customer who 


76 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


could sneak something without 
your seeing could sneak it back 
the same way. He rang up the 
sale and closed the register fast. 

Ernie Meeker went home and 
shaved. Five days — and shaves — 
later, he pushed the first blade, un- 
comfortably dull now, through the 
tiny slot beside the bathroom mir- 
ror. He unwrapped the second 
blade from the packet. 

Five shaves later, he cut him- 
self under the chin with the second 
blade, although he was drawing it 
as gently through his soaped beard 
as if it were only his second shave 
with it, or at most his third. He 
looked at it sourly and checked the 
packet. Wouldn’t have been the 
first time he’d absentmindedly 
changed blades ahead of schedule. 

But there were still three blades 
in their waxed wrappings. 

Maybe, he thought, he’d still 
had one of the blades from the last 
packet and shuffled it into this 
series. 

Or maybe — although the manu- 
facturers undoubtedly had inspec- 
tors to prevent it from happening 
— he’d got a decent blade for once. 

Two or three shaves later, it 
still seemed as sharp as ever, or 
almost so. 

“Funny thing,” he remarked to 
Bill at lunch, “sometimes you get a 
blade that shaves a lot better. 
Looks exactly like the others, but 
shaves better. Or worse sometimes, 
of course.” 


“And sometimes,” his office mate 
said, “you wear out a blade fast 
by not soaking your beard enough. 
For me, one shave with a stiff 
beard and the blade’s through. 
On the other hand, if you’re care- 
ful to soak your beard real good- 
four, five minutes at least— have 
the water steaming hot, get the 
soap really into it, one blade can 
last a long time.” 

“That’s true, all right,” Ernie 
agreed, trying to remember how 
well he had been soaking his beard 
lately. Shaving was a good topic 
for light conversation, warm and 
agreeable, like most bathroom and 
kitchen topics. 

T>UT next morning in the bath- 
room, looking at the reflection 
of his unremarkable face, there was 
something chilly in his feelings that 
he couldn’t quite analyze. He 
flipped his razor open and suspi- 
ciously studied the bright metal 
wafer, then flipped it closed with 
an irritated shrug. 

As he shaved, it occurred to him 
that a good detective-story mur- 
der method would be to substitute 
a very sharp razor blade for one 
the victim knew was extremely 
dull. He’d whip it across his throat, 
putting a lot of muscle into the 
stroke to get through the tangle, 
and — urrk! 

Ridiculous, of course. Wouldn’t 
work except with a straight razor. 
Wouldn’t even work with a straight 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


77 


razor, unless . oh, well. 

He told himself the blade was 
noticeably duller today. 

Next morning, he was still using 
the freak blade, but with a per- 
sistent though very slight uneasi- 
ness. Things should behave as you 
expected them to, in accordance 
with their flimsy souls, he told him- 
self at the barely conscious level. 
Men should die, hearts should 
break, girls should tell, nations 
perish, curtains get dirty, milk 
sour . and razor blades grow 
dull. It was the comfortable, ex- 
pected, reassuring way. 

He told himself the blade was 
duller still. Just a bit. 

The third morning, face lathered, 
he flipped open the razor and lifted 
it out. 

“You’re through,” he said to it 
silently. “I’ve had the experience 
before of getting bum shaves by 
trying to save a penny by pretend- 
ing to myself that a wornout blade 
was still sharp enough, when it 
obviously couldn’t be. Or maybe—” 
he grinned a little wryly— “maybe 
I’d almost get one more shave out 
of you and then you’d fall to pieces 
like the Wonderful One Horse 
Shay and leave me with a chin 
full of steel porcupine quills. No, 
thanks.” 

So Ernie Meeker pushed through 
the little slot beside the mirror 
and heard tinkle faintly down and 
away the first of the Little Gifts, 
the Everlasting Razor Blade. One 


hundred and fifty thousand years 
later, it turned up, bright and shin- 
ing, in the midst of a small knob 
of red iron oxide excavated by an 
archeological expedition of multi- 
brachs from Antares Gamma. 
Those wise history-mad beings 
handed it about wonderingly, from 
tentacle to impatient tentacle. 

r 1 1 HAT day, Ernie felt a little 
sick, somehow. After dinner, he 
decided it was the Thuringer sau- 
sage he’d eaten at lunch. He hur- 
ried up to the bathroom with a 
spoon, but as he clutched the box 
of bicarbonate of soda, preparatory 
to plunging the spoon into it, it 
seemed to him that the box said 
distinctly, in a small inward-out- 
ward voice: 

“No, no, no!” 

Ernie sat down suddenly on the 
toilet seat. The spoon rattled 
against the porcelain finish of the 
washbowl as he laid it down. He 
held the box firmly in both hands 
and studied it. 

Size, shape, materials, blue color, 
closure, etc., were exactly as they 
should be. But the white lettering 
on the blue background read: 

AQUEOUS FUEL CATALYST

quasi-stable H and O, furnishing a

A-F Catalyst should generally 
be renewed when objective tests

U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending 

After reading that several times, 
with suitable mind-checking and 
eye-testing in between, Ernie took 
up a little of the white powder on 
the end of a nailfile. He had 
thought of tasting it, but had in- 
stantly abandoned the notion and 
even refrained from sniffing the 
stuff — after all, the human body 
is mostly water. 

After reducing the quantity sev- 
eral times, he gingerly dumped at 
most four or five grains on the flat 
edge of the washbowl and then 
used the broad end of the nailfile 
to maneuver a large bead of water 
over to the almost invisible white 
deposit. He closed the box, put it 
and the nailfile carefully on the 
window ledge, lit a match and 
touched it to the drop, at the last 
moment ducking his head a little 
below the level of the washbowl. 

Nothing happened. After a mo- 
ment, he slowly withdrew the 


match, shaking it out, and looked. 
There was nothing to see. He 
reached out to touch the stupid 
squashed ovoid of water. 

Ouch! He withdrew his fingers 
much faster than the match, shook 
them more sharply. Something was 
there, all right. Heat. Heat enough 
to hurt. 

TTE cautiously explored the 
boundaries of the heat. It be- 
came noticeable about eighteen 
inches above the drop and almost 
an inch to each side — an invisible 
slim vertical cylinder. Crouching 
close, eyes level with the top of 
the washbowl, he could make out 
the flame— a thin finger of crinkled 
light. 

He noticed that a comer of 
the drop was seething — but only 
a corner, as if the heat were sharp- 
ly bounded in that direction and 
perhaps as if the catalyst were only 
transforming the water to fuel a 
bit at a time. 

He reached up and tugged off 
the light. Now he could see the 
flame — ghostly, about four inches 
high, hardly thicker than a string, 
and colored not blue but pale 
green. A spectral green needle. He 
blew at it softly. It shimmied 
gracefully, but not, he thought, as 
much as the flame of a match or 
candle. It had character. 

He switched on the light. The 
drop was more than half gone now; 
the part that was left was all seeth- 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME

« 


ing. And the bathroom was 
markedly warmer. 

“Ernie! Are you going to be 
much longer?” 

The knock hadn’t been loud and 
his widowed sister’s voice was 
more apologetic than peremptory, 
but he jumped, of course. 

“I am testing something,” he 
started to say and changed it mid- 
way. It came out, “I am be out 
in a minute.” 

He turned off the light again. 
The flame was a little shorter now 
and it shrank as he watched, about 
a quarter inch a second. As soon 
as it died, he switched on the 
light. The drop was gone. 

He scrubbed off the spot with a 
dry washrag, on second thought 
put a dab of vaseline on the wash- 
rag, scrubbed the spot again with 
that — he didn’t like to think of 
even a grain of the powder getting 
in the drains or touching any water. 
He folded the washrag, tucked it 
in his pocket, put the blue box- 
after a final check of the lettering 
—in his other coat pocket, and 
opened the door. 

“I was taking some bicarb,” he 
told his sister. “Thuringer sausage 
at lunch.” 

She nodded absently. 

C LEEP refused even to flirt with 
^ Ernie, his mind was full of so 
many things, especially calcula- 
tions involving the distance be- 
tween his car and the house and 


the length of the garden hose. In 
desperation, as the white hours ac- 
cumulated and his thoughts be- 
gan to squirm, he grabbed up the 
detective story he’d bought at the 
corner newsstand. He had read 
thirty pages before he realized that 
he was turning them as rapidly as 
he could focus just once on each 
facing page. 

He jumped out of bed. My God, 
he thought, at that rate he’d finish 
the book under three minutes and 
here it wasn’t even two o’clock yet! 

He selected the thickest book on 
the shelf, an overpoweringly dull 
historical treatise in small print. 
He turned two pages, three, then 
closed it with a clap and looked at 
the wall with frightened eyes. 
Ernie Meeker had discovered, in- 
side the birthday box that was 
himself, the first of the Big Gifts. 

The trouble was that in that 
wee-hour, lonely bedroom, it didn’t 
seem like a gift at all. How would 
he ever keep himself in books, he 
wondered, if he read them so fast? 
And think how full to bursting his 
mind would get — right now, the 
seven pages of fine-print history 
were churning in it, vividly clear, 
along with the first chapters of the 
new detective story. If he kept on 
absorbing information that fast, 
he’d have to be revising all his 
opinions and beliefs every couple 
of days at least — maybe every 
couple of hours. 

It seemed a dreadful, literally 


80

maddening prospect — his mind 
would ultimately become a uni- 
verse of squirming macaroni. Even 
the wallpaper he was staring at, 
which imitated the grain of wood, 
had in an instant become so fully 
part of his consciousness that he 
felt he could turn his back on it 
right now and draw a picture of 
it correct to the tiniest detail. But 
who would ever want to do such 
a thing, or want to be able to? 

It was an abnormal, dangerous, 
temporary sensitivity, he told him- 
self, generated by the excitement 
of the crazy discovery he’d made 
in the bathroom. Like the thoughts 
of a drowning man, riffling an in- 
finity-paneled adventure-comic of 
his life as he bolts his last rough 
ration of air. Or like the feeling a 
psychotic must have that he’s on 
the verge of visualizing the whole 
universe, having its ultimate secrets 
patter down into the palm of his 
outstretched hand — just before 
the walls close in. 

Ernie Meeker was not a drink- 
ing man, then. A pint had stood a 
week on his closet shelf and only 
been diminished three shots. But 
now he did a good job on the 
sturdy remainder. 

Pretty soon the unbearable, 
edge-of-doom clarity in his mind 
faded, the universe - macaroni 
cooked down to a thick white soup 
uniform as fog, and the words of 
the detective story were sliding 
into his mind individually, or at 


most in strings of three and four. 
Which, if it wasn’t as it ideally 
should be in an ambitious man’s 
mind, was at least darn comfort- 
able. 

He had not rejected the Big 
Gift of Page-at-a-Glance Reading. 
Not quite. But he had dislocated 
for tonight at least the imposed 
nervous field on which it depended. 

"C 1 OR want of a better place, 
Ernie dropped the rubber 
tube from the bathtub spray into 
the scrub bucket half full of 
odorous pink fluid and stared 
doubtfully at the uncapped gas 
tank. The tank had been almost 
empty when he’d last driven his 
car, he knew, because he’d been 
waiting until payday to gas up. 
Now he had used the tube to 
siphon out what he could of the 
remainder (he still could taste the 
stuff!) and he’d emptied the fuel 
line and carburator, more or less. 

Further than that, in the way of 
engine hygiene, Ernie’s strictly 
kitchen mechanics did not go, but 
he felt that a catalyst used in 
pinches shouldn’t be too particular 
about contaminants. Besides, the 
directions on the box hadn’t said 
anything about cleaning the fuel 
tank, had they? 

He hesitated. At his feet, the 
garden hose gurgled noisily over 
the curb into the gutter; it had 
vindicated his midnight estimate, 
proving just long enough. He

looked uneasily up and down the 
dawning street and was relieved 
to find it still empty. He wished 
fervently, not for the first time this 
Saturday morning, that he had a 
garage. Then he sighed, squared 
his shoulders a little, and lifted 
the box out of his pocket. 

Making to check the directions 
the umpteenth time, he received a 
body blow. The white lettering on 
the box had disappeared. The box 
didn’t proclaim itself sodium bi- 
carbonate again — there was just 
no lettering at all, only blue back- 
ground. He turned it over several 
times. 

Right there died his tentative 
plan of eventually sharing his 
secret with some friend who knew 
more than himself about motors 
(he hadn’t decided anyway who 
that would be). It would be just 
too silly to approach anyone he 
knew with a more-than-wild story 
and featureless blue box. 

For a moment, he came very 
close to dropping the box between 
the wide-set bars of the street 
drain and pouring the pink gas 
back in the tank. It had hit him, 
in a way for the first time, just how 
crazy this all was, how jarringly 
implausible even on such hypoth- 
eses as practical jokes, secret prod- 
uct perhaps military, or mad in- 
ventor (except himself). 

For how the devil should the 
stuff get into his bathroom dis- 
guised as bicarb? That circum- 


stance seemed beyond imagination. 
Green flames . vanishing let- 
ters . “torque-twisters, trans- 
lators” ... a box that talked . 

4 T that point, simple faith came 
to Ernie’s rescue : in the same 
bathroom, he had seen the green 
flame; it had burned his fingers. 

Quickly he dipped up a little 
of the white powder on the edge 
of a fifty-cent piece, dumped it in 
the gas tank without quibbling as 
to quantity, rapped the coin on the 
edge of the opening, closed and 
pocketed the blue box, and picked 
up the spurting hose and jabbed 
it into the round hole. 

His heart was pounding and his 
breath was coming fast. That had 
taken real effort. So he was slow in 
hearing the footsteps behind him. 

His neighbor’s gate was open 
and Mr. Jones stood open-mouthed 
a few feet behind him, all ready for 
his day’s work as streetcar motor- 
man and wearing the dark blue 
uniform that always made him 
look for a moment unpleasantly 
like a policeman. 

Ernie swung the hose around, 
flipping his thumb over the end to 
make a spray, and nonchalantly 
began to water the little rectangle 
of lawn between sidewalk and 
curb. 

The first things he watered were 
the bottoms of Mr. Jones’s pants 
legs. 

Mr. Jones voiced no complaint. 


82 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


He backed off several steps, stared 
intently at Ernie, rather palely, 
it seemed to the latter. Then he 
turned and made off for the street- 
car tracks at a very fast shuffle, 
shaking his feet a little now and 
then and glancing back several 
times over his shoulder without 
slowing down. 

Ernie felt light-headed. He de- 
cided there was enough water in 
the gas tank, capped it, and mo- 
mentarily continued to water the 
lawn. 

“Ernie! Come on in and have 
breakfast!” 

He heeded his sister’s call, tell- 
ing himself it would be a good 
idea “to give the stuff time to 
mix” before testing the engine. 

He had divined her question and 
was ready with an answer. 

“I’ve just found out that we’re 
supposed to water our lawns only 
before seven in the morning or 
after seven in the evenings. It’s the 
law.” 

I T was the day for their monthly 
drive out to Wheaton to visit 
Uncle Fabius. On the whole, Ernie 
was glad his sister was in the car 
when he turned the key in the 
starter — it forced him to be calm 
and collected, though he didn’t 
feel exactly right about exposing 
her to the danger of being blown 
up without first explaining to her 
the risk. But the motor started 
right up and began purring pow- 


erfully. Ernie’s sister commented 
on it favorably. 

Then she went on to ask, “Did 
you remember to buy gas yester- 
day?” 

“No,” he said without thinking; 
then, realizing his mistake, quick- 
ly added, “I’ll buy some in 
Wheaton. There’s enough to get 
us there.” 

“You didn’t think so yesterday,” 
she objected. “You said the tank 
was nearly empty.” 

“I was wrong. Look, the gauge 
shows it’s half full.” 

“But then how . Ernie, didn’t 
you once tell me the gauge doesn’t 
work?” 

“Did I?” 

“Yes. Look, there’s a station. 
Why don’t you buy gas now?” 

“No, I’ll wait for Wheaton — I 
know a place there I can get it 
cheaper,” he insisted, rather lame- 
ly, he feared. 

His sister looked at him steadily. 
He settled his head between his 
shoulders and concentrated on 
driving. His feeling of excitement 
was spoiled, but a few minutes of 
silence brought it back. He thought 
of the blur of green flashes inside 
the purring motor. If the passing 
drivers only knew! 

Uncle Fabius, retired perhaps a 
few years too early and opinion- 
ated, was a trial, but he did know 
something about the automobile 
industry. Ernie chose a moment 
when his sister was out of the room 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


83 


to ask if he’d ever heard of a white 
powder that would turn water into 
gasoline or some usable fuel. 

“Who’s been getting at you?” 
Uncle Fabius demanded sharply, 
to Ernie’s surprise and embarrass- 
ment. “That’s one of the oldest 
swindles. They always tell this 
story about how this man had a 
white powder or something and 
demonstrated it once with a pail 
of water and then disappeared. 
You’re supposed to believe that 
Detroit or the big oil companies 
got rid of him. It’s just another of 
those malicious legends, concocted 
—by Russia, I imagine— to weaken 
your faith in American Industry, 
like the everlasting battery or the 
razor blade that never gets dull. 
You’re looking pale, Ernie — don’t 
tell me you’ve already put money 
in this white powder? I suppose 
someone’s approached you with a 
proposition, though?” 

VV/TTH considerable difficulty, 
” Ernie convinced his uncle that 
he had “just heard the story from 
a friend.” 

“In that case,” Uncle Fabius 
opined, “you can be sure some fuel- 
powder swindler has been getting 
at him. When you see him — and 
be sure to make that soon — tell 
him from me that—” and Uncle 
Fabius began an impassioned nine- 
ty-minute defense of big business, 
small business, prosperity, Ameri- 
ca, money, know-how, and a num- 


ber of other institutions that de- 
fended pretty easily, so that the 
situation was wholly normal when 
Ernie’s sister returned. 

As soon as the car pulled away 
from the curb on their way back 
to Chicago, she reminded him 
about the gas. 

“Oh, I’ve already done that,” he 
assured her. “Made a special trip 
so I wouldn’t forget It was while 
you were out of the room. Didn’t 
you hear me?” 

“No,” she said, “I didn’t,” and 
she looked at him steadily, as she 
had that morning. He similarly 
retreated to driving. 

Stopping for a railroad cross- 
ing, he braked too hard and the 
car stalled. His sister grabbed his 
arm. “I knew that was going to 
happen,” she said. “I knew that 
for some reason you lied to me 
when—” The motor, starting readily 
again, cut short her remark and 
Ernie didn’t press his small tri- 
umph by asking her what she was 
about to say. 

To tell the truth, Ernie wasn’t 
feeling as elated about today’s 
fifty-mile drive as he’d imagined 
he would. Now he thought he could 
put his finger on the reason : It was 
the completely . well, arbitrary 
way in which the white powder 
had come into his possession. 

If he’d concocted it himself, or 
been given it by a shady promoter, 
or even seen the box fall out of the 
pocket of a suspicious-looking man 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

in a trenchcoat, then he’d have felt 
more able to do something about 
it, whether in the general line of 
starting a fuel-powder company or 
of going to the F.B.I. 

But just having the stuff drop 
into his hands from the sky, so 
to speak, as if in a crazy dream, 
and for that same reason not feel- 
ing able to talk about it and as- 
sure himself he wasn’t going crazy 
. oh, it is rough when you can’t 
share things, really rough; not be- 
ing able to share depressing news 
corrodes the spirit, but not being 
able to share exciting news can 
sometimes be even more corrod- 
ing. 

Maybe, he told himself, he could 
figure out someone to tell. But 
who? And how? His mind shied 
away from the problem, rather de- 
cisively. 

%¥/" HEN he checked the blue 
” box that night, the original 
sodium bicarbonate lettering had 
returned with all its humdrum 
paragraphs. Not one word about 
exhaust velocities. 

From that moment, the fuel- 
powder became a trial to Ernie 
rather than a secret glory. He’d 
wake in the middle of the night 
doubting that he had ever really 
read the mind-dizzying lettering, 
ever really tested the stuff — per- 
haps he’d bring from sleep the 
chilling notion that in the dim- 
ness and excitement of Saturday 


morning he’d put the water in some 
other car’s gas tank, perhaps Mr. 
Jones’s. He could usually argue 
such ideas away, but they kept 
coming back. And yet he did no 
more bathroom testing. 

Of course the car still ran. He 
even fueled it once again with the 
garden hose, sniffing the nozzle 
to make sure it hadn’t somehow got 
connected to the basement furnace 
oil-tank. He picked three o’clock 
in the morning for the act, but 
nevertheless as he was returning 
indoors he heard a window in Mr. 
Jones’s house slam loudly. It un- 
settled him. Coming home the next 
day, he caught his sister and Mr. 
Jones consulting about something 
on the latter’s doorsteps, which un- 
settled him further. 

He couldn’t decide on a safe 
place to keep the box and took to 
carrying it around with him day 
and night. Bill spotted it once 
down at the office and by an un- 
happy coincidence needed some 
bicarb just then for a troubled 
stomach. Ernie explained on the 
spur of the moment that he was 
using the box to carry plaster of 
Paris, which involved him in 
further lies that he felt were quite 
unconvincing as well as making 
him appear decidedly eccentric, 
even butter-brained. Bill took to 
calling him “the sculptor.” 

Meanwhile, besides the problem 
of the white powder, Ernie was 
having other unsettling experiences, 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


85 


stemming (though of course he 
didn’t know that) from the other 
Gifts — and not just the Big Gift of 
Page-at-a-Glance Reading, though 
that still returned from time to 
time to shock his consciousness and 
send him hurrying for a few quick 
shots. 

T IKE many another car-owning 
commuter, Ernie found the 
traffic and parking problems a bit 
too much for comfort and so used 
the fast electric train to carry him 
five times a week to the heart of 
the city. During those brief, swift, 
crowded trips Ernie, generally 
looking steadily out the window 
at the brown buildings and black 
stanchions whipping past, enjoyed 
a kind of anonymity and privacy 
more refreshing to his spirit than 
he realized. But now all that had 
been suddenly changed. People had 
started to talk to him; total strang- 
ers struck up conversations almost 
every morning and afternoon. 

Ernie couldn’t figure out the 
reason and wasn’t at all sure he 
liked it — except for Vivian. 

She was the sort of girl Ernie 
dreamed about, improperly. Tall, 
blonde and knowing, excitedly 
curved but armored in a black suit, 
friendly and funny but given to 
making almost cruelly deflating 
remarks, as if the neatly furled 
short umbrella dangling from her 
wrist might better be a black dog 
whip. 

86 


She worked in an office too, 
a fancier one than Ernie’s, as he 
found out from their morning con- 
versations. He hadn’t got to the 
point of asking her to lunch, but 
he was prodding himself. 

Why such a girl should ever 
have asked him for a match in 
the first place and then put up 
with his clumsy babblings on sub- 
sequent mornings was a mystery 
to him. He finally asked her about 
it in what he hoped was a joking 
way, though she seemed to know 
a lot more about joking than he 
did. 

“Don’t you know?” she coun- 
tered. “I mean what makes you 
attractive to people?” 

“Me attractive? No.” 

“Well, I’ll tell you then, Ernie, 
and I’ve got to admit it’s some- 
thing quite out of the ordinary. 
I’ve never noticed it in anyone 
else. Ernie, I’m sure your knowl- 
edge of romantic novels is shame- 
fully deficient, it’s clear from your 
manners, but in the earlier ones— 
not in style now — the hero is 
described as tall, manly, broad- 
shouldered, Anglo-Saxon features, 
etcetera, etcetera, but there’s one 
thing he always has, something that 
sounds like poetic over-enthusiasm 
if you stop to analyze it, a physical 
impossibility, but that I have to 
admit you, Ernie, actually have. 
Flashing eyes.” 

“Flashing eyes? Me?” 

She nodded solemnly. He 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


87 


thought her long straight lips 
trembled on the verge of a grin, 
but he couldn’t be sure. 

“How do you mean, flashing 
eyes?” he protested. “How can 
eyes flash, except by reflecting 
light? In that case, I guess they’d 
seem to ‘flash’ more if a person 
opened them wide but kept blink- 
ing them a lot. Is that what I do?” 
“No, Ernie, though you’re do- 
ing it now,” she told him, shaking 
her head. “No, Ernie, your eyes 
just give a tiny flash of their own 
about every five seconds, like a 
lighthouse, but barely, barely bright 
enough for another person to no- 
tice. It makes you irresistible. Of 
course I’ve never seen you in the 
dark; maybe they wouldn’t flash 
in the dark.” 

“You’re joking.” 

Vivian frowned a little at that 
remark, as if she were puzzled 
herself. 

“Well, maybe I am and maybe 
I’m not,” she said. “In any case, 
don’t get conceited about your 
Flashing Eyes, because I’m sure 
you’ll never know how to take 
advantage of them.” 

When he parted from her down- 
town, pausing a moment to watch 
her walk away with feline majesty, 
he muttered “Flashing Eyes!” with 
a shrug of the shoulders and a 
skeptical growl. Just the same, he 
ducked his head as he moved off 
and he pulled the brim of his hat 
down sharply. 


A fternoons, hurtling home 

in the five o’clock rush, it was 
not Vivian but Verna who fre- 
quently occupied the seat beside 
him, taking up rather more space 
in it than the Panther Princess. 
Verna was another of his newly ac- 
quired and not altogether welcome 
conversation-pals, along with Jacob 
the barber, Mr. Willis the druggist 
and Herman the health-food manu- 
facturer, inventor of Soybean 
Mush — conquests of his Flashing 
Eyes or whatever it was. 

Verna was stocky, pasty-faced, 
voluble (with him), coy, and had 
bad breath — he could see the tiny 
triangles of pale food between her 
incisors and canines whenever her 
conversations became particularly 
vehement and confidential, which 
was often. She always had a stack 
of books hugged to her stomach. 
She worked in a fur-storage vault, 
she said, and could snatch quite a 
bit of time for reading — rather 
heavy reading, it seemed. 

It wasn’t very long before 
Verna was head-over-heels (fearful 
picture!) infatuated with him. 
Somehow his friendliness had 
touched a hidden spring in this 
ugly, friendless, clumsy girl and 
for once she had lost her fear of 
the world’s ridicule and opened 
her hulking heart to another hu- 
man being. It was touching but 
rather overpowering, especially 
since she always opened her mouth 
too. He learned a great deal about 


88 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


herself, her invalid father, Eliza- 
bethan and Restoration poetry, 
paleontology, an organization 
known as the Working Girls’ 
Front, Mr. Abrusian, and a brassy 
Miss Minkin who sounded like a 
fiendish caricature of Vivian. 

He felt that deliberately avoid- 
ing Verna would be a dirtier trick 
than he liked to think himself 
capable of. Nevertheless there 
were times when he seriously 
wished he’d never acquired what- 
ever power it was — except for 
Vivian, of course. What the devil, 
he asked himself for the nth time, 
could that power be? 

That night, in the bathroom, 
the question came back to him 
and he impulsively switched off 
the light and looked into the mir- 
ror. He gasped and seemed on 
the point of shrieking out some- 
thing, but he only grasped the 
washbowl more tightly and stared 
into the mirror more intently. 

After about a minute, he tugged 
on the light again. He was pale. 
He had convinced himself of the 
actual existence of the phenome- 
non that was in reality the third 
of the Little Gifts: Flashing Eyes. 

He couldn’t notice anything in 
the light, but in the dark his eyes 
gave off a faint blue flash about 
every five seconds, just as Vivian 
had said, lighting up his cheeks 
and eyebrows like some comic- 
book vampire! 

It might be attractive by day, 


when it just registered as an im- 
palpable hint, but it was damn 
sinister in the dark! It wasn’t much, 
but it was there — unless the 
flashes were inside his head and 
he was projecting them . blue 
. something called the Purkinje 
effect? . but then Vivian had ac- 
tually seen . oh, damn! 

SUDDENLY he wildly looked 
^ around, a little like a trapped 
animal. Why did it always have 
to happen in the bathroom, he 
asked himself — the bicarb, the 
flame, the blade (if that counted), 
and now this? Could there be 
something wrong about the bath- 
room, something either in the room 
itself or in his childhood associa- 
tions? 

But neither the bathroom walls 
nor his minutely searched memory 
returned an answer. 

It was dark in the hall outside 
and he almost bumped into his 
sister. He recoiled, stared at her a 
moment, then threw his hand over 
his eyes, darted into his bedroom 
and shut the door. 

“Is there something wrong, Er- 
nie?” she called after him. 
“Wrong?” 

The door muffled his voice. 
“How do you mean?” 

“I mean about your eyes.” 

“My eyes?” It was almost a 
scream. “What about my eyes?” 
“Don’t shout, Ernie. I mean are 
they painful?” 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


89 


“Painful? Why should they be 
painful?” 

“I really don’t know, Ernie.” 
She was being very patient and 
calm. 

“I mean did you notice any- 
thing about them?” He was try- 
ing to be the same without much 
success. 

“Just that you put your hand 
up to them as if they hurt.” 

“Oh.” Great relief. “Yes, they do 
smart a little. I guess I’ve been 
using them too much. I’m putting 
some eye-drops in them now.” 

“Can I help you, Ernie? And 
shouldn’t you see an opto . 
ocu . optha ... I mean an eye 
doctor?” 

Ernie answered “No” to both 
those questions, but of course it 
took a lot more lying and impro- 
vising and general smoothing out 
before his sister would even pre- 
tend to be satisfied and stop her 
general nagging for the evening. 
She was getting uncomfortably 
cagy and curious lately, addicted 
to asking such questions out of a 
blue sky as: 

“Ernie, when we were visiting 
Uncle Fabius, did you actually be- 
lieve that you went out and 
bought gas?” 

That one momentarily brought 
Ernie’s stammer back, something 
which hadn’t troubled him for 
years. 

And when she wasn’t asking 
questions, her quiet studying of 


him for long minutes was even 
more upsetting. 

TVTEXT morning, on the way to 
-L ’ the electric train, Ernie made 
a purchase at the drugstore. When 
he sat down beside Vivian, she 
took one look at him and gave a 
very deliberate-sounding hollow 
laugh. 

“Black glasses!” she said. “I tell 
him he’s attractive because he has 
Flashing Eyes and within two days 
he’s wearing black glasses. I sup- 
pose I should have guessed it.” 

“But my eyes hurt,” Ernie pro- 
tested. “Sensitive to sunlight, I 
think.” He wished he could ex- 
plain to her that he’d bought the 
glasses not only in case he got 
caught out at night, but also to 
convince his sister he hadn’t been 
lying about sore eyes. He hadn’t 
intended to wear them by day and 
hardly knew why he’d put them on 
before joining Vivian. 

“Spare me your rationaliza- 
tions,” she said. “Your motives are 
clear to me, Ernie, and they hap- 
pen to be very commonplace.” 

She leaned toward him and her 
voice, little more than a whisper, 
took on an unexpectedly gloomy, 
chilling, hopeless tone. 

“See these people all around us, 
Ernie? They’re suicides, every one 
of them. Day by day, in every 
way, they’re killing themselves. 
People love them, admire them, 
and it only makes them uneasy.

They have abilities and charms by 
the bushel — yes, they do, even 
that man with the wen on his neck 
—and they only try to hide them. 
The spotlight turns their way and 
they goof. They think they’re run- 
ning away from failure, but ac- 
tually they’re running away from 
success.” 

Ernie looked at them, he 
couldn’t help it, her voice made 
him, and the ability of Page-at-a- 
Glance Reading chose that mo- 
ment to come back to him, only 
applied to faces instead of letters, 
and there seemed to be another 
ability along with it, unclear as 
yet but frightening. He felt like a 
very old detective scanning the 
lineup for the thousandth time. 

The black glasses didn’t inter- 
fere a bit — the dozens of faces 
in this speeding electric car were 
suddenly as familiar as the court 
cards in a deck — and he had the 
feeling that, like a bunch of pink 
pasteboards, they were about to be 
hurled in his face. 

My God, he asked himself, 
flinching, how could you go on liv- 
ing with so many faces so close to 
you, so completely known?— each 
street you turned into, each store 
you entered, each gathering you 
joined, another deluge of unique 
features. Ugly, pretty, strong, weak 
— those words didn’t mean any- 
thing any more in this drenching of 
individuality he was getting, and 
that showed no signs of stopping. 


So he hardly heard Vivian say- 
ing, “And it’s true of you, Ernie— 
in spades, for your black glasses,” 
and he hardly remembered parting 
from her, and when he found him- 
self alone he did something un- 
precedented for him at that time 
of day — he went to a bar and 
drank two double whiskies. 

' | '’HE drinks brought the down- 
■*- town landscape back to nor- 
mal and stopped the faces printing 
themselves on his mind, but they 
left him very disturbed, and the 
suspiciousness with which he was 
treated at the office didn’t improve 
that, and Ernie began to wish for 
ordinariness and commonplaceness 
in himself more than anything in 
the whole world. If only, he silent- 
ly implored, there were some way 
of junking everything that had 
happened to him in the past few 
weeks — except maybe Vivian. 

Verna on the train home posi- 
tively terrified him. She was un- 
usually talkative and engulfing this 
evening and he thought that if the 
faces-forever feeling came to him 
just as she was baring her food- 
triangles and all, he wouldn’t be 
able to stand it. Somehow, it 
didn’t Yet the very intensity of 
his distaste frightened him. Not for 
the first time, the word “insanity” 
appeared in his mind, pulsing in 
pale yellowish-green. 

Half a block from home, passing 
his parked car (with an uncon- 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


91 


scious little veer of avoidance), 
he spotted three figures in close 
conference in front of his house: 
his sister, a man in dark blue— yes, 
Mr. Jones, and ... a man in a 
white coat. 

Almost before he knew it, he 
was in his car and driving away. 
He truly didn’t know what he was 
going to do, only that he was go- 
ing to do it, and found a trivial in- 
terest in trying to guess what it 
was going to be. Whatever it was, 
it was going to dim that yellowish- 
green word, decrease its type-size, 
make him a little more able to 
face the crisis waiting him at 
home ... or somewhere. 

He had a picture of himself get- 
ting on an airplane, another of 
renting a room in a slum, another 
of stopping the car on a lonely, 
treeless country road and getting 
out and looking up to the coldly 
glimmering Milky Way— why? 

That last picture was the most 
vivid, and when he realized he had 
actually stopped his car, it was a 
moment before it would go away. 
Then he saw he was parked in 
front of a demolished old apart- 
ment building a few blocks from 
his home. Only yesterday he’d 
watched the last wall going down. 
Now, just across the littered side- 
walk from him, the old cellar 
gaped, flimsily guarded in front by 
a makeshift rail and surrounded 
on the other three sides by great 
hillocks of battered bricks. To- 


morrow probably (and in fact that 
was the way it happened) a bull- 
dozer would tumble them forward, 
filling the cellar with old bricks 
and brick-dust, leveling the lot. 

"IVT OW he knew what he was go- 
-L ' ing to do. He unlatched the 
top over the windshield and 
pushed the button. Slowly the top 
folded back over his head, show- 
ing the smoke-dark sky, almost 
night. He hitched up a little in 
the seat, reached inside his coat, 
pulled out the blue box he always 
carried and pitched it into the 
dark pit across the sidewalk. 

He was driving away almost be- 
fore it landed. Yet through the 
hum of the motor he thought he 
heard something call faintly, 
“Good-by.” 

The material of the filled-in cel- 
lar stayed fairly dry for many 
years and the atom-bombing, when 
it finally came, created a partial 
surface-seal of fused stone over 
that area. However, the bicarb box 
fell apart in time; water reached it 
in little seepings and was accumu- 
lated as a non-evaporating fuel- 
and-oxydizer mix. The amount of 
this strange fluid grew and grew, 
eventually invading and filling a 
now-blind section of the city’s old 
sewer system. 

Many tens of thousands of years 
after that, the buried pool was 
sensed by the fuel-finders of a 
spaceship from up Polaris way, 


92 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


which had made an emergency 
landing on the ruined planet. A 
well was drilled and the mix 
pumped up and the centipedal Po- 
larians, scuttling about the bleak 
landscape, had a fine time trying 
to explain how such a sophisticated 
fluid should occur in a seeming 
state of nature. However, they 
were grateful to the Cosmic All- 
Father. 

Long before that, Ernie had ar- 
rived home in something of a daze. 
He told himself that he had cast 
off the most tangible element of 
his “insanity,” but he didn’t feel 
any the better for it. In fact, he felt 
distinctly apathetic when his sis- 
ter confronted him and only with 
an effort did he manage to brace 
himself for the trial he knew she 
had in store for him. 

“Ernie,” she said hesitatingly, 
“I’ve come to a decision about 
something— about a change in our 
arrangements here, to tell you the 
truth— and I’ve gone ahead with it 
without consulting you. I do hope 
you won’t mind.” 

“No,” he said heavily, “I guess 
I won’t mind.” 

“I’m doing it partly on Mr. 
Jones’s advice,” she added slow- 
ly. “As a matter of fact he sug- 
gested it.” 

Ernie nodded. “Yes, I’ve noticed 
the two of you conferring to- 
gether.” 

“You have? Then maybe you 
know what I’m talking about.” 


“Oh, yes.” Ernie nodded again 
and smiled grimly. “The man in 
white?” 

She laughed. “Exactly, the man 
in white. For a long time, I’ve 
thought it was just too much 
bother for either of us to carry the 
milk home, and the eggs and my 
yogurt too. So I decided to have 
the milkman that Mr. Jones uses 
make deliveries. Mr. Jones brought 
him over half an hour ago and it’s 
all arranged. Four quarts a week, 
one dozen eggs, and yogurt Tues- 
days and Fridays.” 

HP HE Invisible Being and his 
Coadjutor, backtracking for a 
checkup, summarized the situa- 
tion. 

The latter said, “So he’s already 
thrown away the Everlasting Cos- 
metic Knife and the Water Split- 
ter; he seems to be trying to re- 
ject the third Little Gift and the 
first Big One, while he still isn’t 
even conscious of the other two 
Gifts.” 

“Cheer up,” said the Invisible 
Being. “It’s his life and he’s doing 
what he thinks best.” 

“Yes,” the Coadjutor said, “but 
he doesn’t know he’s making these 
decisions for his race as well as 
himself. Sometimes I think Galaxy 
Center makes it too hard for chaps 
like him. For instance, that trick 
of having the images on the box 
fade back to the old ones.” 

“Nonsense! We have to take all 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


93 


reasonable precautions that our ac- 
tivities remain secret He knew 
that the powder worked. He 
should have had faith.” 

“Sometimes it takes a lot of 
faith.” 

“You’re right it does.” The In- 
visible Being smiled his Cheshire 
smile. “You feel a lot for these 
test subjects, don’t you? That’s 
fine, but you’ve got' to remember 
you can’t accept the Gifts for 
them; that’s one thing they have 
to do themselves, however long 
they take about it. Which reminds 
me, I think we ought to set up a 
recorder here to report the final 
outcome of the test to Galaxy 
Center.” 

“Good idea.” 

“And cheer up, I say. This test 
isn’t over yet and our featherless 
biped isn’t necessarily licked. If he 
thinks to link up the third Little 
Gift with the two Big Ones, he 
has a pretty sweet setup for mak- 
ing psychic progress— and his race 
will be Galactic Citizens in a jiffy.” 

“You’re right.” 

“Moreover, it stands to reason 
he’s soon going to become aware 
of the Great Gift, and that gen- 
erally gives a person a jolt and 
makes him think seriously about 
other things.” 

“True enough — though I still 
have the feeling you intend some 
sardonic trick in conjunction with 
the Great Gift. Are you sure you’re 
not planning to leave some other 


setup here along with the recorder? 
I notice you’ve got a spare Juxta- 
poser in the ship and it bothers 
me.” 

“That, dear Coadjutor, is my 
business. Whatever I do, it won’t 
interfere in any way with the fair- 
ness of the tests.” 

“Sometimes I think the tests 
are too fair,” the Coadjutor ob- 
served. “I’d like to be able to 
ease them up a bit in special 
cases.” 

“Confidentially, my friend, so 
would I.” 

r I ' HE Great Gift announced 
itself to Ernie next morning at 
7:53 sharp, when the Special 
slowed to forty miles an hour to 
swing past the platform on which 
he was waiting for the Express. 

One moment he was standing 
morning-weary on the thick wooden 
planks, looking down through the 
quarter-inch gaps between them 
at the cinders five feet below, 
vaguely conscious of a woman’s 
white-polka-dotted black skirt on 
one side of his field of vision and 
a man’s brown shoes and briefcase 
to the other. 

Next moment he was in a small 
cab under which steel rails were 
vanishing at an alarming speed, 
and way ahead he could just make 
out the platform on which he was 
standing, and something was hurt- 
ing his head and he was slumping 
forward and everything was dark- 


94 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


ening and the cab was leaping 
forward more swiftly still. 

The third moment he was back 
on the platform, running furiously 
to get off it He didn’t care who 
yelled at him or whom he bumped, 
so long as it didn’t slow him down. 
The people were just blurs any- 
way and soon he was beyond them. 
He took in two strides the short 
flight of wooden _ steps leading 
down off the platform proper and 
spurted the last sixty feet to the 
stairs leading down to street level. 
There he stumbled, recovered him- 
self, and chanced a hasty backward 
look. 

There was a tall man at his 
heels, hugging a briefcase and pant- 
ing hard. Then, beyond the tall 
man, he saw the platform rear up 
like a wooden caterpillar, spilling 
people against the bright gray 
morning sky. There was a cosmic 
crunch and the battered Special, 
still coming strong, burst through 
the upreared platform in a blos- 
soming broken-matchstick crown 
of planks and beams — and big 
blue sparks where a writhing 
power wire, snagged by the up- 
rearing platform, was grounding 
against the first car. 

Ernie ducked his head and 
plunged down the steps ahead. 

(That was how I came to meet 
Ernie Meeker. I was the tall man. 
As you can imagine, it’s quite 
strange to be standing in a huddle 
of fresh-washed morning com- 


muters and have the one beside 
you close his eyes and slump a 
little and then take off like a bat 
out of hell— without a word spoken 
or a thing happened to explain it. 
I started to laugh, but then I got 
the funniest feeling of curiosity and 
terror and I took off after him. It 
saved my life. 

(Afterward, Ernie and I went 
back to help with the ghastliness, 
but pretty soon there were more 
than enough trainmen, firemen, 
police, and what not, and we got 
chased off. We had a couple of 
drinks together and met a few 
times after and that’s how I got 
some of this story. But my chief 
sources of information I am not 
permitted to disclose.) 

A S the Invisible Being had pre- 
dieted, Ernie’s first brush with 
the Great Gift gave him a con- 
siderable jolt, though he didn’t sus- 
pect at first that it was a per- 
manent gift. 

He analyzed what had hap- 
pened, quite reasonably, I believe, 
as a case of second sight. Some- 
how his mind had been projected 
into the brain of the motorman of 
the Special just at the moment the 
latter had his stroke (the final 
official explanation too) and blind- 
ly put on more speed instead of 
reducing it for the approaching 
curve and station. His second sight 
saved his life by getting him off 
the platform before the Special 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


95 



jumped the tracks and ploughed 
through it. 

It certainly gave a jolt to Ernie’s 
habit patterns, as it temporarily 
did of a great many other people. 
He started driving his car to work, 
for one thing, and he took to drink- 
ing regularly in the evenings, 
though not excessively as yet. 

He also had the feeling, which 
he did not try to analyze, that his 
miraculous escape marked the end 
of the “strange weeks” in his life, 
when he’d had such odd illusions 
or been the victim of such odd cir- 
cumstances; and, true enough, that 
first week or so there were no re- 
currences of his chillingly weird 
experiences. 

T>UT jolts have their infallible 
•*-* Law of Diminishing Effects. 

After a few days, Ernie found 
the traffic and parking problems as 
nervous and wearisome as ever 
and he grew envious of the snug 
commuters meditating luxuriously 
in their electric coaches. Come the 
first morning of the third week and 
he was standing on the rebuilt plat- 
form, studying the new planks, ties 
and rails with a pleasantly morbid 
interest. 

Vivian was not in her accus- 
tomed seat nor on the train, as far 
as he could tell, which did not 
surprise him, though it disap- 
pointed him sharply; the Panther 
Princess had a stronger hold on 
his feelings, or at least on his 


imagination, than he’d realized. 

But Verna was on the train 
home all right; in fact, she gave a 
small whoop of pleasure when 
she spotted him. And he had bare- 
ly sat down beside her when who 
should come prowling smoothly 
along but Vivian in a charcoal 
version of her tailored black ar- 
mor. 

Ernie jumped up and blurted 


96 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



out introductions. Vivian accepted 
his seat with a certain deliberate- 
ness and with a smile that seemed 
to Ernie to say, “So I’m his morn- 
ing light-badinage girl, but this is 
the girl Mr. Meeker goes home 
with. It’s another instance of 
‘black-glasses’ behavior, don’t you 
think? He puts her on whenever 
he gets afraid he’s getting atrac- 
tive.” 


' I ' HE two women started to chat 
- easily enough, however, and 
shortly Ernie got over his con- 
fusion and, smiling down at them 
from where he swayed in his aisle 
with his hand lightly touching the 
back of the seat ahead, was even 
thinking quite smugly that here 
in one seat, by gosh, were the 
woman he wanted and the woman 
who wanted him. Very interesting 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME

to be the man in the middle. 

Just at that moment, the power 
came back to him that made every- 
thing feverishly real, expanding his 
center of attention to his visual 
horizons, and this time it was only 
a prelude, for a second gateway 
opened behind the first — a win- 
dow into all human hearts and 
minds, the power of human insight 
fantastically sharpened and en- 
larged. He could “read minds,” or 
at least he knew the motives— the 
core of values and consciousness— 
of any person he cared to look at 
Most especially, he knew the mo- 
tives of Verna and Vivian almost 
as if he were them. 

The big thing about Vivian was 
her fear— no, her conviction, that 
she wasn’t attractive. Every glance 
her way knocked a hole in the 
armor of artificial attractiveness 
she built around herself, and all 
the hours she devoted to perfecting 
it, even the desperate worship she 
lavished on her body, were all ut- 
terly lost. A simple relationship 
with another human being was un- 
thinkable; her armor got in the 
way and under her armor she knew 
she was worthless. A man was 
sometimes attracted to her armor 
— never to herself! — but as soon 
as he started to scrutinize it, it be- 
gan to tarnish and crumple. 

She hoped that other people, 
men especially, had a trace of her 
own weaknesses, and she sniped 
away at them constantly to get 


under the armor to find out. Ernie 
was one in a long series of such 
men. She was actually in love with 
him, but only as one loves a dream, 
not the really Ernie at all. Physi- 
cally he was disgusting to her, like 
most men. 

"'i7"ERNA, on the other hand, had 
™ absolute confidence that she 
was sufficiently attractive for all 
practical purposes. She wasn’t in 
love with Ernie at all. She wanted 
to make an intellectual conquest 
of him, add him to her private 
Brain Trust, her cultured en- 
tourage that won Mr. Abrusian’s 
seldom-tendered admiration and 
broke Miss Minkin’s heart, and fi- 
nally get Ernie to join the Work- 
ing Boys’ Front. He was one of 
her projects. If it became tactical- 
ly necessary during her campaign, 
she knew that Ernie would be 
only too happy to jump in bed 
with her, food-triangles and all. 

Now in other circumstances 
(who really knows?), Ernie might 
have found the courage to accept 
Vivian and Verna as they really 
were and work on from there, ruth- 
lessly discarding his false pictures 
of them — and of himself. He 
might conceivably have found the 
strength to accept all people not 
as shadowy projections of himself, 
fabricated targets of his desires 
and aversions, puppets in his 
private chess games and circuses, 
but as complete persons with in- 


98 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


exhaustible surprises and contra- 
dictions, each a microcosm, a uni- 
verse-in-little with his or her own 
earth and stars, spaceflight and 
crawling, heaven and hell. 

But under the present circum- 
stances, Ernie was confused. His 
knowledge of the real Vivian 
spoiled completely the titillating 
picture of the Panther Princess, 
who might submit to him contemp- 
tuously in the end — he needed 
that sex idol more than he needed 
truth. As for Verna, her stalwart 
self-reliance and her accurate ap- 
praisal of his own motives and pos- 
sible future behavior were both 
unbearably humiliating to him. 
And the delight of really knowing 
people was completely outweighed, 
in his tired spirit, by the thought 
of the lifetime of work that would 
be involved in adjusting himself to 
this new knowledge. It was so 
much more comfortable to work 
with stereotypes. 

The Express was slowing for 
his station. Both girls were looking 
at him puzzledly. 

“Good-by, Verna. Good-by, 
Vivian,” he said in a set sort of 
voice. “This is where I get off.” 
He moved stiffly toward the 
door. They watched him go, and 
turned to each other with a frown. 

T HAT evening marked the be- 
ginning of Ernie’s serious drink- 
ing. He never saw either of the V- 
girls again. He took his car or the 


bus to work; then, for a short 
period, he took taxicabs, then he 
lost his job and was working in 
another part of the city. He be- 
came mixed up with a number of 
other women and crowds, but they 
are not part of this or any story. 

Among other things, his drinking 
eventually completely confused his 
memories of abnormal personal 
powers with his entirely normal il- 
lusions of alcoholic ones. And it 
also seemed to be blotting out the 
former. Once, at a party, he bet 
twenty dollars that his eyes glowed 
in the dark. Next morning he was 
relieved to discover, after making 
several anxious phone calls, that 
he’d lost his bet. 

When he finally pulled out of 
it, some five years later, because 
of a growing aversion to liquor 
that he only understood later, the 
two Big Gifts of Page-at-a-Glance 
and Mind Reading were gone for- 
ever. 

The Great Gift had a more 
durable lodgment in him. From 
his alcoholic years, he brought 
hazy memories of accidents 
avoided because of sudden wrong- 
ended visions of onrushing cars, 
alley rollings missed because he’d 
seen himself reeling along a block 
away through the eyes of lounging 
hoodlums. Now, sober again, he 
had a clear confirmation of it when 
he left a banquet on a trumped- 
up excuse because of a disturbing 
vision of inexplicable rodlike 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME

shapes — and read the next day 
that a hundred of the guests, of 
whom four finally died, had come 
down with bacterial food poison- 
ing. Another time, hiking in dry 
woods, he’d smelled smoke that 
his companions couldn’t — and 
persuaded them to turn back, 
avoiding a disastrous flash fire that 
broke out soon afterward. 

He had to admit to himself that 
he certainly seemed to have the 
gift of second sight, warning him 
against threats to his life. 

“All right,” he told himself, “so 
forget it. Gifts are upsetting. Even 
as a kid, you sweated more about 
your birthday presents than you 
ever got fun out of them.” 

Our story has already jumped 
five years; now it must jump twen- 
ty. Ernie is living with his sister 
again; while he was drinking, they 
pulled apart, and now they’ve once 
more pulled together. They’re hav- 
ing dinner, have arrived at dessert, 
a big piece of chocolate cake each 
with satiny thick creamy frosting 
and filling. 

Ernie looks at his piece— and 
sees himself climbing stairs and 
clutching at his heart. He thinks of 
warning his sister, but she’s already 
halfway through her piece. Then 
she goes on and eats Ernie’s. 

RNIE’S sister didn’t get food 
poisoning, she only got fat, 
but the incident of the chocolate 
cake was for Ernie the beginning 


of a series of peculiar food revul- 
sions and diet experiments that 
eventually made Ernie instead of 
his sister the family yogurt-fiend 
and a regular customer of his old 
acquaintance, Herman, the health- 
food manufacturer. 

Herman had to admit that Ernie 
had cooked himself up a pretty 
good longevity diet for an amateur, 
though there were some items in it 
that made the old man shake his 
head — and he always asserted that 
Ernie was passing up a good thing 
in Soybean Mush. 

Ernie got his diet tailored to fit 
his tastes and stuck to it. He had 
a strong suspicion of what had 
happened, though he tried not to 
think about it too often: that his 
gift of second sight had taken to 
warning him of the longer-range 
dangers to his existence; after all, 
chocolate cake can be as deadly as 
atomic bombs in the long run. 

More years passed. Friends and 
relatives began to remark quietly 
to each other that his sister was 
aging faster. Ernie, they had to 
admit, was a remarkably well-pre- 
served old gent. Ironic, considering 
what a drunk he’d been and what 
strange junk he insisted on eating 
now. 

One day Ernie’s self-styled 
health diet began to pall on him. 
It didn’t revolt him; it merely left 
him unsatisfied, yet with no yearn- 
ing for any particular food he 
could think of. He lived with this 


100 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


yearning for some weeks, meditat- 
ing on it and trying to guess its 
nature. Finally he had an inspira- 
tion. He headed for Mr. Willis’ 
drugstore. 

The bent, silvery-haired man 
greeted him eagerly; somehow 
there was a special warmth about 
the friendships Ernie had made 
during the “strange weeks” (Verna 
and Vivian excepted) that put 
them in a different class from any 
other of his human relationships. 

f ?TVT OW what can I give you, 
-L ’ Ernie?” Mr. Willis asked. 
“Anything in the place within 
reason.” 

“I’ll tell you, Bert. I’d like to 
go back in your dispensary — you 
with me, if you want — and just 
shop around.” 

“That’s a sort of screwy idea, 
Ernie. I couldn’t sell you any nar- 
cotics or sleeping pills, of course 
—well, maybe a few sleeping pills.” 
“I wouldn’t want any.” 

“What’s the idea, Ernie? Getting 
interested in chemistry in your 
old ... You know, Ernie, you just 
don’t look your years.” 

“Secret of mine. Yes, in a way 
I’ve got interested in chemistry.” 
“Won’t talk, eh? I remember, 
when I first met you, I tagged you 
for an evening inventor. Well, 
come on back and shop around. 
Just don’t ask me for elixer vitae, 
aurum potabile, or ground philoso- 
phers’ stone.” 


“Not unless I see ’em.” 

Afterward, Bert Willis used to 
say it was one of the most mysti- 
fying experiences of his life. For a 
good half a day, Ernie Meeker 
studied the rows of jars, cannisters 
and glass-stoppered bottles, some- 
times lifting two down together 
and contemplating them, one in 
each hand, as if he could weigh 
the difference. Often he’d take out 
a stopper and sniff, and maybe, 
asking permission of Bert with a 
glance, take up a dab of some pow- 
der and taste it 

“You know that game,” Bert 
would say, “where someone goes 
out of the room and you all decide 
on an object, or hide one, and he 
comes back and tries to find it by 
telepathy or muscle-reading or 
something? That was exactly the 
way Ernie was acting. Dog on a 
difficult scent.” 

A couple of times, especially 
when the customers came in, Bert 
wanted to chase him out, except 
that Ernie was such a special 
friend and Bert was so darn 
curious about it all himself. 

In the end, Ernie made a good 
twenty purchases, including a mor- 
tar and pestle and two poisons for 
which Bert made him sign, though 
the amounts were less than a lethal 
dose. 

“Actually none of the chemicals 
he bought were very dangerous,” 
Bert would say. “And none of 
them were terribly unusual. The 


BULLET WITH HIS NAME 


101 


thing about them was that, put to- 
gether, they just didn’t make sense 
—as a medicine or anything else. 
Let me see, there was sulphur, bis- 
muth, a bit of mercury, one of the 
sulfa drugs, a tiny packet of auric 
chloride, and ... I had ’em all 
on a list once, but I’ve lost it.” 

After that, Ernie always mixed 
a little grayish paste in his cup of 
yogurt at suppertime. 

Ernie stopped aging altogether. 

A FTER his sister’s coffin was 
lowered past the margins of 
green matting into the ground, 
Ernie shook hands with the minis- 
ter, walked Bert Willis and Her- 
man Schover to their car and told 
them he thought he’d better drive 
home with some relatives who’d 
turned up. Actually he just wanted 
to stay behind a while. It was a 
beautiful blue-and-white summer 
day; the tidy suburban cemetery 
had caught his fancy, and now he 
felt like a quiet stroll. 

Ernie followed his little impulses 
these days. As he sometimes said, 
“I figure I’ve got plenty of time. 
I just don’t feel the pressure like I 
used to.” 

The last car chugged away. Er- 
nie stretched and started to stroll, 
slowly, but not like an old man, 
now that he was alone. His hair 
had grown whiter in the last few 
years and his face a little wrinkled, 
but that was due to the very judi- 
cious use of silvering and theatri- 


cal liner — people’s comments 
about his youthfulness had gotten 
wearisome and would, he knew, 
eventually become suspicious. 

Keeping himself oriented by a 
white tower at the cemetery gate, 
he arrived at an area that had no 
graves as yet, no trees either, just 
lawn. He made his way to the 
center of it, where there was a 
gently swelling hummock, and sat 
down in the warm crinkly grass, 
resting his back against the slope. 
The sky was lovely, enough clouds 
to be interesting, but a great oval 
of pure blue just overhead— a pear- 
shaped gateway to space. 

He felt no grief at his sister’s 
death, only the desire to think a 
bit, have a quiet look at his past 
and another at the great future. 

Alone like this, he dared to face 
his fate for a moment and admit 
to himself that, all wishful think- 
ing aside, it really began to look 
as if he were going to live forever, 
or at least for a very long time. 

Live forever! That was a phrase 
to give you a chill, he told him- 
self. And what to do, he asked 
himself, with all that time? 

Back in the “strange weeks,” 
he’d have had little trouble in an- 
swering that question — if only 
he’d known then what he did now 
and realized what was being of- 
fered him. For, during his sober 
decades, Ernie had gradually come 
to a shrewdly accurate estimate of 
what had happened to him then.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


He thought of it in terms of having 
been offered six Gifts and turned 
down five of them. 

T>ACK in the “strange weeks” 
and armed with the five re- 
jected Gifts (Page-at-a-Glance and 
Mind Reading were the only ones 
that counted, though), he could 
easily have said, “Live forever by 
all means! Increase your knowl- 
edge and understanding until your 
mind bursts or is transfigured. 
Plunge forever into the unending 
variety of the Cosmos. Open your- 
self to everything.” 

But now, equipped to travel 
only as a snail . 

Still, even snails get somewhere. 
With forever to work with, even 
four-words-at-a-glance gets you 
through many, many books. Pa- 
tient love and dispassionate 
thought give you human insight in 
the end, can finally open the 
tightest shutter on the darkest hu- 
man heart. 

But that would take so very long 
and Ernie felt tired. Not old, just 
tired, tired. Best simply to watch 
the soft clouds — the pear-shaped 
gateway had become almost cir- 
cular. To do anything but drift 
through life, a stereotype among 
stereotypes, was simply . too . 
much . work . 

At that very moment, as if his 
thought had summoned the ex- 
perience into being, another scene 
filmed over the blue sky and 


white clouds above him. The sud- 
den humming in his ears — a kind 
of “audible silence”— informed him 
that his second sight was at work, 
warning him of some deadly dan- 
ger. But this was a more gentle 
instance of it, for not all his con- 
sciousness jumped somewhere else. 
All through the experience, he was 
still aware of himself leaning 
against the grassy hummock, of the 
restful melancholy of the scene 
around him, and of the sky over- 
head. The second scene only su- 
perimposed itself on the first. 

He was poised many hundreds 
of miles above the Earth, a ghost- 
Ernie immune to the airlessness 
and the Sun’s untempered beams. 
At his back was black night filled 
with stars. Below him stretched the 
granulated dry brown of Earth’s 
surface, tinged here and there with 
green, clumped with white cloud, 
and everywhere faintly hazed with 
blue. 

T 7 P there in space with him, right 
at his elbow, so close that he 
could reach out and touch it, was 
a tiny silver cylinder about as big 
as a hazelnut, domed at one end, 
reflecting sunlight from one point 
in a way that would have been 
blinding enough except that Ernie’s 
ghost eyes were immune to bright- 
ness. 

As he reached out to examine it, 
the thing darted away from him as 
if at some imperious summons.

like a bit of iron jumping through 
a magnetic field. 

But in spite of its enormous ac- 
celeration, Ernie’s ghost was able 
to follow it in its downward plunge. 
It kept just ahead of his out- 
stretched fingertips. 

The brown granules that were 
Earth’s surface grew in size. The 
tiny metal cylinder began to glow 
with more than reflected sunlight. 
It turned red, orange, yellow and 
then blazing white as atmospheric 
friction transformed it into a 
meteor. 

Ernie’s ghost, immune to fric- 
tion and incandescence alike, fol- 
lowed it as it dove toward its tar- 
get — for even though Ernie had 
never heard of a Juxtaposer and 
how it brought objects together, he 
had the feeling, from the dizzy 
speed of the meteor’s plunge, that 
it yearned for something. 

He knew most meteors vapor- 
ized or exploded, but this did not, 
even when Earth’s brown surface 
grew rivers and roads. Suddenly 
there was a cloudbank ahead; then, 
in the white, there appeared an al- 
most circular hole toward the very 
center of which the meteorite 
plunged. 

Everything was happening very 
fast now, but his ghost senses were 
able to keep pace. As they plunged 
through the cloud-ring and the 
green landscape below grew ex- 
plosively, he saw the white tower, 
the trees, the curving drives, and 


the clearing which was now the 
target. 

There was still time to escape. 
Lying on the warm grass, with 
death lancing down from the sky 
at miles a second, he had merely 
to roll over. 

But it was simply . too . 
much . work . 

"C 1 LSEWHERE near Earth, a re- 
corder sped toward Galaxy 
Center a message which ended, 
“Six Gifts tendered, all finally re- 
fused. I will now sign off and await 
pickup with one Juxtaposer.” 

A little later, a Receiver in 
Galaxy Center passed the message 
to a Central Recorder, which filed 
it in the Starswarm 37 section with 
this addition: “Spiritual immaturi- 
ty of Terran bipeds indicated. Ad- 
vise against enlightenment and ad- 
mission to Galactic citizenship. 
Test subject humanely released.” 

POLICE, digging into the turf 
under Ernie’s shattered head two 
days later found the bright bullet, 
cold now, of course, and untar- 
nished. 

“Looks like silver!” one cop 
said, scratching his head. “Haven’t 
I heard somewhere that the Mafia 
use silver bullets? So bright, 
though.” 

Lieutenant Padilla, later on, 
lifting the bullet in his forceps to 
re-examine it for rifling marks, had 
the same thought about its bright-

ness. By now, however, he knew 
it was not silver. (What alloy was 
never satisfactorily determined. 
Actually it was made of the same 
substance as the Everlasting Razor 
Blade.) 

This time, although he still 
found no rifling marks, a tiny dull 
stretch on the flat end of the cylin- 
der caught his attention. He took 
up a magnifier and examined it 
carefully. 

A moment later, he put down 
the magnifier, snatched up the 
pocketbook found on the dead man 


and rechecked some cards in it 
The bullet dropped from the for- 
ceps, rolled a few inches. The lieu- 
tenant sat back in his chair, breath- 
ing a little hard. 

“This is one for the books, all 
right!” he told himself. “I’ve heard 
a lot of people, soldiers especially, 
talk about such bullets, but I never 
expected to see one!” 

For under the magnifying glass, 
finely engraved in very tiny let- 
ters, he had read the words :

THOSE IDIOTS FROM 
EARTH by Richard Wilson. Bal- 
tantine Books, N. Y. $2.00 

B ALLANTINE follows up Wil- 
son’s successful Girls from 
Planet Five with this collection of 
ten assorted short stories. The 
yarns are of varying length and 
likewise of varying quality. 

The title story, evidently writ- 
ten for the collection in the whacky 
mood of Girls, is the account of the 
attempted invasion of Earth by 
super-computers. Only the most 
cockeyed Multivac conceivable 
sits between them and conquest. 


“The Hoaxters” and “The In- 
habited” you’ve seen in this maga- 
zine. “Lonely Road” is a mood 
piece of exceptional impact. The 
remaining tales taper off, but not 
too far, from these quite lofty high 
points. 

THE LIVING PAST by Ivar 
Lissner. G. P. Putnam’s Sons, N.Y., 
$5.95

and most books are skim- 
mable. Crafty Lissner, realizing 
this literary fact of life, has there- 
fore studded almost every page

with attention rivets. It is easy to 
see why it was received with rave 
reviews by the European press and 
why German, Italian, French and 
Dutch editions have been best sell- 
ers. 

The range is enormous: each 
region of the world worthy of note 
gets its due. Lissner amazes in his 
ability to telescope living, human 
detail into limited space, and he 
is at his best in dealing with the 
most enigmatic of ancient civiliza- 
tions: Crete, Mohenjo-Daro, Etru- 
ria, Tiahuanacu. 

This is a truly remarkable job 
that does just what the title claims 
to do. 

AND THERE WAS LIGHT by 
Rudolph Thiel. Alfred A. Knopf, 
N. Y., $6.95 

'T’HIEL'S book, subtitled “The 
-*■ Discovery of the Universe,” is 
a beautifully organized work. It 
takes up where last month’s Theo- 
ries of the Universe by Munitz 
left off. But, where that work con- 
cerned itself solely with Cosmolo- 
gy on the grand scale, Thiel brings 
many of the individuals who formu- 
lated the grandiose theories into 
human focus. 

The reader is led through the 
developmental stages of astronomy 
— the orientation tool and seasonal 
clock of antiquity, the dark age of 
astrology and the present age of 
reality. Skillfully written and trans- 


lated, and with excellent reproduc- 
tions of old engravings and modern 
illustrations, it is digestible for lay- 
man and professional alike. 

THEY’D RATHER BE RIGHT 
by Mark Clifton and Frank Riley. 
Gnome Press, N. Y., $3.00 

' 1 1 HE four years since magazine 
publication of this novel 
haven’t resolved my doubts about 
the credibility of the authors’ con- 
cept. 

The hero and “heroine” are a 
young but incredibly mature tele- 
path and a super-servomechanism, 
nicknamed Bossy, with the extra- 
ordinary capability of reteaching 
and rebuilding humans whose 
thought processes haven’t frozen 
into false patterns. 

Joe Carter, the telepath, and 
Professors Hoskins and Billings, 
who built Bossy via unsuspected 
control by Carter, have had to go 
underground to avoid being seized 
by the oppressive opinion-con- 
trol government. While in hiding, 
they reconstruct Bossy who, in 
turn, knocks out a gorgeous tele- 
pathic helpmeet for Joe from an 
old Skid Row slattern. 

Although a passably workman- 
like job, loose ends outnumber 
neat knits in this yarn.

ISELY, Anthropology Dept, 
head at the U. of Penn., is 
that rare bird, the thoroughgoing 
technician blessed with superior 
imagination. Accordingly, his non- 
fiction journey into time is a won- 
derful blend of erudition and 
whimsy. For example, the opening 
chapter describes his descent into 
an eroded slit and his confronta- 
tion with an ancient mammalian 
skull. “The creature had never 
lived to see a man, and I, what 
was it I was never going to see?” 
“I have long been an admirer 
of the octopus but I have always 
felt it to be just as well for us 
that they never came ashore, but 
— there are things down there that 
are still coming ashore.” 

“The profound shock of the leap 
from animal to human status is 
echoing still in the depths of our 
subconscious.” 

These quotes barely illustrate 
the delight of this admixture of 
scientific lore and pure fantasy. 
An anthropological gotta, unre- 
servedly recommended. 

MAN : HIS FIRST MILLION 
YEARS by Ashley Montagu. 
World Publishing Co., Cleveland, 
$3.75 

/~kF all the sciences, anthropolo- 
gy ultimately is the basic. Who 
and what are we? Why and how 
are we? Answer these questions 
and the divine puzzle falls into 


place. Unfortunately, the odds are 
stacked against our solving these 
problems. Additionally, there is 
violent disagreement among an- 
thropologists. 

Montagu holds that a jump of 
400 cc cranial capacity is “incon- 
ceivable.” Therefore, the australo- 
pithecines, apelike men of South 
Africa, are very low in the chain of 
humanity. Loren Eisely believes 
that Ice Age chronology requires 
drastic revision and that the “Mil- 
lion Years” are in truth closer to 
three hundred thousand but, more 
important, that cranial capacity 
suddenly expanded, that modem 
man is a very recent product. 

Montagu’s ever-recurrent theme 
is that “human beings can learn 
to do the things that men have 
anywhere done.” In his study of 
past and present cultures, he finds 
universal similarities and believes 
that mankind is moving toward 
unity without uniformity. 

SOLOMON’S STONE by L. 
Sprague de Camp. Avalon Books, 
N.Y. $2.75 

T? OR many years, I have been 
a de Camp follower. While 
not quite making me an official 
deserter from his ranks, the above 
opus does succeed in removing 
some of the gilt from an idol. 

The hero, a colorless CPA, is 
stranded on the astral plane during 
an experiment in sorcery by an 


108 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


unwittingly summoned demon. The 
astral level is crammed with ideal- 
ized versions of his work-a-day 
friends. He himself is a French 
cavalier in a world of knights, em- 
perors, western heroes and a horde 
of Aryan Wotans. 

He outwits them all, of course, 
with his CPA background, in a 
few humorous encounters. But de 
Camp has done better in the past 
with less. 

REASON AND CHANCE IN 
SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY by 
R. Taton. Philosophical Library, 
N.Y., $10.00 

A RECENT release by Philo- 
sophical was John Rowland’s 
study of the limitations of the sci- 
entific method. The present work, 
though obviously not designed for 
the purpose, has restored my faith 
in said method. 

Part One lists Mathematics, the 
Theoretical Sciences and Observa- 
tional and Experimental Sciences 
as realms of discovery. Part Two 
contrasts systematic discovery, 
chance, error and flashes of thought 
as factors. Part Three covers 
various aspects of discoveries. 

The book is well documented 
with personal notations by famed 


scientists that give a considerable 
insight into the creative workings 
of the mind of genius. 

STAR GIRL by Henry Winter- 
feld. Harcourt, Brace, N. Y., $2.75 

T7VDR a juvenile, this is a most 
uncommon book. A visitor 
from space, a pretty young girl, 
has fallen into a Bavarian forest 
from her father’s flying saucer. 
Unable to land, he cautions her 
to return to the clearing in the 
woods the following night. She is 
found by a group of youngsters 
and their efforts to protect her 
make the story. They must adopt 
frantic measures to keep her from 
the hands of the adults who don’t 
believe her origin and want to put 
her away. 

All this is not unusual, but Win- 
terfeld’s depiction of both young 
and adult thoughtlessness and 
cruelty certainly is. Also, his ET 
is 87 years old and wears a neck- 
lace of huge diamond beads. She 
is not a case of arrested develop- 
ment, though the town constable 
would like to make it so. 

Exciting enough and different 
enough to satisfy jaded juvenile 
tastes.

Illustrated by MARTINEZ 


T HE car came, finally, to a 
shuddering halt, slewed 
violently across the road. 
Fletcher gave himself a moment 
to recover. He had never run a 
man down before. But it needed 
no prior experience to know that 
if it happened at seventy-five — 
and if the man stepped straight in 
front of your headlights — what 
was left of the victim was beyond 
urgency. 

He backed the car to the side 
of the road and got out on trem- 
bling legs. He peered back along 
the highway. The moon was up, 
but the scrawling skid marks were 
still as black where they stemmed 


from the shadows of night a hun- 
dred yards away. 

The sight snapped into focus 
the reality of what had just hap- 
pened. Fletcher broke into a run, 
retracing the black lines, the dark- 
ness stumbling back before him. 

He stopped abruptly. 

The lines came to an end, lurid- 
ly wide and black, where he had 
slammed on the brakes. And— there 
was nothing else. No body, no 
trace of anything he had told him- 
self to be prepared to find. No 
blood or tattered flesh, no mangled 
shoe horribly alone. 

He wondered if his car had car- 
ried the body along in front of 


110 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


it. He turned to go back before he 
realized that in that case he would 
surely have seen some trace on 
the road between. 

The thought came that he hadn’t 
actually felt the impact. You 
probably didn’t at that speed, he 
told himself, and peered into the 
tree-lined darkness of the road- 
side. The collision must have 
hurled the man clear. 

His eye caught a stir in the 
scrub then. Something moved into 
a patch of moonlight before it 
slithered behind the trunk of a 
big tree. 

For -a frantic moment, Fletcher 
tried to tell himself that he had 
been mistaken; the victim had 
somehow survived, dragged him- 
self clear— and that was what he 
had seen. But the explanation 
withered. He had seen it too clear- 
ly— a snake, a big one. Python- 
size. Snakes that huge weren’t na- 
tive for several thousands of miles 
around. 

His defensive reaction was to 
forget it and resume his search for 
the victim’s body. If a python had 
escaped from a local zoo, it wasn’t 
his affair— certainly not right now. 

But a stronger impulse guided his 
feet toward the tree. He was a psy- 
chiatrist. Either he had seen a 
snake or he was having traumatic 
delusions. He had to know which. 
He skirted the tree warily. 

“Good evening.” A man stepped 
out from the tree’s shadow. 


Tj 1 LETCHER jumped- “Who are 
■*- you?” he blurted inanely. 

“My name’s Lewis,” the stranger 
said. “I live in Sanderville, three 
miles on.” 

“What are you doing here?” 
Fletcher’s voice was shaky. He had 
killed a man — and hadn’t found a 
trace of him yet. He had seen a 
big snake in country where there 
weren’t such things. And now, si- 
lently and unconcernedly, as if 
from his own front door, stepped 
this stranger. 

“Just an evening walk.” The 
man half-smiled. “A habit of mine.” 
He frowned, as slightly as he had 
smiled. “Why?” 

“Didn’t you hear anything? I ran 
someone down in my car a minute 
ago.” 

The man shrugged. “The main 
line’s just beyond the woods. A 
freight train just went through.” 

True enough, Fletcher could 
hear the noise of a train rumbling 
into the distance. “But didn’t you 
see a—” 

He stopped, suddenly alerted to 
the danger of appearing crazy. But 
this one could be nailed. He leaped 
behind the tree. Behind it was a 
clear tract of turf. No room to con- 
ceal anything, let alone a snake 
of the size he had seen ... or 
thought he had seen. And the 
stranger obviously hadn’t seen it, 
or he would surely have mentioned 
it. Then Fletcher must have imag- 
ined it.

111 


Strangely, the certainty didn’t 
disturb him. Nobody needed to re- 
mind him the mind could do odd 
things as a result of shock. And 
he still had to find the body of 
his victim. He turned back to the 
stranger, who was looking at him 
curiously. 

“Help me, will you?” Fletcher 
asked. He went back to the high- 
way. The stranger accompanied 
him willingly enough. They beat 
the roadside for yards around the 
scene of the accident, but without 
success. 

They straightened simultaneous- 
ly- 

“Are you sure there was an ac- 
cident?” the stranger said. 

Fletcher looked at him coldly. 
“You can see the skid marks.” 

The man nodded. “But that 
doesn’t prove there was a victim. 
You can get things wrong. An 
unlit road, moonlight, tree 
shadows.” 

“Maybe,” Fletcher growled. But 
the startled image that had sprung 
up in the road had been no acci- 
dental pattern of moonlight and 
shade. That was one certainty, 
even if he couldn’t find the body. 
“Anyway, I’m reporting the acci- 
dent at Sanderville. I—” 

He broke off as something regis- 
tered. The stranger had said he 
lived at Sanderville, three miles 
on. Not back or up the road. 

On. That meant the stranger 
knew which way Fletcher had been 


traveling. Or did it? Was his dis- 
turbed brain putting unnecessary 
stress on an innocent enough 
phrase? Fletcher didn’t care. 

XJE looked directly into the 
stranger’s eyes. “I’ll want you 
to come along as witness.” The 
next moment, he cursed himself. 
He should have merely offered a 
lift. 

The man looked indignant. “But 
I wasn’t a witness. I told you I—” 

“All the same—” Fletcher took a 
grip on the other’s arm— “if you 
don’t mind—” 

The man squirmed in his grasp, 
which tightened warily. The 
stranger was not tall, but seemed 
wiry. Fletcher was bigger, though, 
and— he felt— stronger. But sudden- 
ly there wasn’t a man in his grasp 
any more. The arm seemed to 
waver— then, for a moment so brief 
that Fletcher couldn’t be sure that 
it actually happened, melt into 
formlessness. 

Instantly there was another 
creature— a stag, already poised for 
flight. 

Reason promptly abdicated. It 
was something much more primi- 
tive, fear, that hurled Fletcher onto 
the stag, grappling blindly with it. 

The shape became man again 
and lashed out at Fletcher. He 
half-turned his head. The blow hit 
his ear. It hurt, but didn’t stun. 
His own right plunged into the 
other’s solar plexus. The man’s 


112 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


eyes popped foolishly as his breath 
stopped. Fletcher didn’t give him a 
chance to change into any other 
shape. He slammed a cross to the 
jaw. 

Panting, Fletcher looked down 
at the senseless body. Somewhere 
an owl hooted, and Fletcher was 
aware of the craziness of what he 
was doing— rtanding over an un- 
conscious man, on guard against 
him changing his shape! 

But he — it — didn’t. Whatever 
strange power this man had evi- 
dently didn’t work when he was 
unconscious. 

What power was it? Hypnosis? 
Fletcher didn’t know. He did know 
now that his own senses hadn’t 
been playing him tricks. At least, 
not without outside influence. He 
bent down and slung the man over 
his shoulder. 

Getting back to the car, he bun- 
dled the body into the trunk and 
locked it. On his way to the driv- 
ing seat, he took a belated look at 
the front of the car. There wasn’t 
a mark on it. He pursed his lips 
thoughtfully, then climbed in and 
drove off. 

And he drove straight through 
Sanderville. There was no reason 
to believe that the police were 
competent to deal with creatures 
that seemed able to change their 
shape at will. 

There was no reason to believe 
he was, either— but he intended to 
try. 


r f' , HE stranger groaned and 
-*• stirred on the couch. Fletcher, 
seated rather more distantly from 
him than if he had been a pa- 
tient, craned forward. 

Eyes blinked open, stared blank- 
ly up at the lamp angled above, 
then moved to Fletcher. 

“You’re safe here,” Fletcher said 
quickly but softly. In a firmer tone, 
he added, “The door’s locked and 
the windows are shuttered.” 

The alarm in the stranger’s eyes 
died to a smoldering resignation. 
He sat up, rubbing his jaw. “Where 
is this?” he asked finally. “The 
police?” 

“No, it’s my office. I’m a psy- 
chiatrist. You gave me an almighty 
fright tonight, walking under my 
car the way you did— apart from 
what happened afterward. I 
brought you here to hear your 
explanation.” 

“You worked that one out 
then?” 

“Does it take much working 
out? I run a man down, can’t find 
the body,, do see a snake, then 
don’t see it, but find a man. When 
the man changes into a stag and 
back again, there’s something going 
on. Something so irrational that 
it’s not irrational to figure that the 
man was also the snake. That he 
changed shape to escape sudden 
death the way an ordinary man 
might duck. Right?” 

The man nodded dumbly. 

Fletcher waited for him to say 


BLANK FORM 


113 


something. When he didn’t, he 
added levelly: “The question is — 
what kind of man are you?” 

The man was sitting with shoul- 
ders bowed, his gaze downcast. 
Now he raised melancholy eyes to 
look straight into Fletcher’s. “I 
don’t know.” 

Fletcher, returning his gaze, felt 
a twinge of sympathy— and a con- 
viction that the other was speak- 
ing the truth. “Do you mind if I 
try to help?” 

The man smiled bitterly. “I 
don’t think anyone could. But 
you’ve got me backed into a 
corner.” 

“Hell, I don’t want you in a 
corner. It may take time and I 
can’t keep you locked up here. 
You’ve got to be convinced of my 
good will, otherwise that power 
of yours might panic.” 

“It might. Especially if it got 
suspicious of your motives. If, for 
instance, you tried to publicize my 
case.” 

Fletcher laughed. “Would any- 
one believe it?” 

The other laughed, too, briefly, 
as if despite himself. “I guess not.” 
He was suddenly dead serious. “If 
you knew what it was like to be . 
the way I am, you—” 

“We’re all odd in some respect,” 
Fletcher murmured, then, seeing 
the look in the other’s face, “I’m 
sorry. Stock response. You can 
trust me.” 

“All right. I haven’t been able 


to find the answer myself. But it’s 
your risk.” 

‘Til take that chance.” Fletcher 
poised his pen. “Full name?” 
“John Lewis.” The man smiled 
wryly. “Or Bill Smith or Fred 
Jones. I chose John Lewis.” 

“I see. Will all the rest be made 
up, too?” 

T EWIS shrugged. “There isn’t 
much to make up. They don’t 
ask many questions, the circles I’ve 
been moving in. On forms, I say 
I’m twenty-eight, born in Alaska 
—that’s far enough away to put 
people off checking.” 

“Amnesia, then. But for the rest 
of this, let me have it straight. 
Just when and where did you find 
yourself without a name and a 
past?” 

“Up in Oregon. There was a big 
project going on up there, a new 
town being built. One of the men 
found me in the woods.” 

“What kind of shape were you 
in? Damn, I mean—” 

Lewis gave a flicker of a smile. 
“That’s all right. To answer the 
question I don’t believe you meant, 
I was this shape. And I was in fair 
condition. But I was pretty help- 
less. I couldn’t even speak Eng- 
lish.” 

Fletcher’s eyebrows rose. “When 
did that come back?” 

“It — didn’t come back.” 

“You mean you learned it all 
over again?”

“That’s right. Only I don’t think 
it was again.” 

“How long ago was this?” 

“Not quite three years ago.” 
“Hm-mm.” Fletcher made a 
note, a single word, Intelligent. For 
the other had perfect command of 
the language now. “What happened 
then? How did you get by?” 

“It wasn’t hard. All they wanted 
up there was a strong arm and a 
broad back. And there was an 
acute labor shortage. After a 
couple of years, I’d stacked up a 
good roll, so I came down here 
to find out about myself if I could.” 
“You think you came from these 
parts, then?” 

“Nothing so easy. It was just 
that there weren’t so many books 
up there. I had to read to find out 
the answer, if there was one. I read 
books on psychiatry, medicine, 
folklore, myth, the occult, heaven 
knows what else.” He looked up 
at Fletcher, as the latter made two 
lines under the word Intelligent. 
“But I drew a blank.” 

“Then your other — ah — talent 
had already shown itself by then.” 
The other looked at him warily, so 
he added, “If yours had been an 
ordinary amnesia case, you would 
already have gone to see some- 
body like me, wouldn’t you?” 
Lewis relaxed, suspicion yield- 
ing to a respect for Fletcher’s un- 
derstanding. “Yes, this talent, as 
you call it — it first happened when 
I’d been on the job about six 


months. The iron-fighters botched 
setting a girder. They’d got one 
end bolted, and the other end came 
free. It’s quite a sight to see a 
solid-steel flange bend like card- 
board. The girder came swinging 
down, crashed through a platform 
and headed for me. 

“The next thing I clearly re- 
member was finding myself in the 
woods nearby, trembling. I seemed 
to have fallen down, my head was 
so near the ground. But I was still 
standing on my feet — all four of 
them. They were yellow, and I had 
a tail. I felt it thrashing as I looked 
out from cover at the confusion of 
the accident. I had changed into a 
mountain lion. Just like that. I 
realized I was safe — and I sud- 
denly changed back. I returned to 
the job. 

“Nobody had noticed. There 
had been too much going on. Three 
men had been injured. Someone 
did start to say that it was funny 
but he could have sworn he’d 
seen— then he stopped and shook 
his head. 

“There was only one other time. 
I was swimming in a lake up there. 
I went out further than I should 
and got into difficulties. I changed 
into a fish.” 

LETCHER finished his nota- 

tion. “These changes have hap- 
pened in an emergency, just like 
this evening. But have you ever 
tried to change?”

“It doesn’t work,” Lewis said. 
“It seems to work only like a re- 
flex.” 

“As I thought.” Fletcher pon- 
dered. “You said you’ve read folk- 
lore, myth, the occult. There are 
accounts there, of course, of men 
changing into other creatures.” 

“I know. But not the way I 
change. Anyway, I don’t feel be- 
witched, if that doesn’t sound like 
a stupid thing to say.” 

“No. Besides, if it were witch- 
craft, I wouldn’t be qualified to 
help at all. So let’s examine other 
possibilities. You’ve lived with this 
for three years. Do you have any 
theory at all?” 

Lewis framed his lips to speak, 
stopped, framed his lips again. 
Fletcher waited. 

Lewis seemed finally to make 
up his mind. “I think I came from 
another world.” 

He looked at Fletcher almost 
defiantly, but Fletcher said only, 
“Yes?” 

“Yes. I believe that I crashed, 
that I lost not only my memory 
but my shape. Heaven knows what 
I was originally, but I must have 
been of some species that could 
change its shape at need, which 
would be an asset on the different 
worlds it visited. Does that make 
sense?” 

“More sense than anything I 
can think up on the spur of the 
moment. Whatever the truth, the 
only way to discover it is to get 


beyond the traumatic block that 
is sealing off your previous exist- 
ence.” He looked deliberately at 
Lewis. “That might be dangerous.” 
“How?" 

“Because a traumatic block is 
set up in the mind in self-defense. 
Penetrate it— there’s no knowing 
how the mind may react. And, in 
your case, another danger occurs 
to me. If your makeup is non- 
human, the treatment itself might 
have a totally unexpected effect 
on you.” 

Lewis considered that. “I’m 
game, if you are. But I think you 
face two dangers, too. First, my 
peculiar talent might not take 
kindly to my being treated and 
might run amok. It hasn’t been en- 
tirely fear for my own safety that’s 
stopped me visiting a psychiatrist 
before. What treatment do you 
have in mind?” 

“Narco-analysis. I put you un- 
der narcosis and, by asking you 
questions, try to dig your past out 
of your subconscious. I’ll just have 
to keep my fingers crossed that 
your talent will keep quiet. But 
what’s the other danger?” 

“Well, if I did come from an- 
other world, I must have been on 
some kind of mission. What if the 
mission . was a hostile one?” 

G lancing up suddenly at 

him, Fletcher smiled. “There 
you sit, decent enough to be con- 
cerned about my welfare, and 


BLANK FORM 


117 


you’re trying to convince me that 
you might be a monster!” 

“I’m serious,” Lewis insisted. 

“Then I’m ready to take both 
chances. You may have suffered a 
loss of memory, and a loss of 
shape, but I think that if you had 
had a hostile intent, at least a trace 
of that attitude would have re- 
mained.” He looked at his wrist. 
“It’s midnight. My apartment’s in 
this building. Unless you’ve got 
other commitments, how about 
staying with me while you’re un- 
der treatment? It would make it 
easier to fit you in with my other 
patients.” 

“All right.” Lewis looked at 
Fletcher quizzically. “You’re going 
to a lot of trouble for me. I don’t 
quite get it.” 

Fletcher laughed. “Scratch a 
psychiatrist and you’ll find a re- 
pressed Sherlock Holmes. You 
chose the wrong man to get run 
down by.” 

Lewis smiled. “You know, I’m 
beginning to hope I chose the right 
one.” 

Y noon the next day, Fletcher 
knew narco-analysis wasn’t go- 
ing to be the answer. To all ques- 
tions relating to Lewis’s existence 
before his discovery in the Oregon 
woods, his mind, freed from con- 
scious control, made no answer at 
all. Even to suggestions of a crash, 
response was negative. 

Fletcher was beginning to weigh 


the possibilities of more drastic 
methods, like shock treatment, 
when a fresh idea hit him. 

“Change into a St. Bernard dog,” 
he said, feeling for a wild moment 
the ludicrousness of the command. 

Lewis promptly changed into a 
St. Bernard. 

“Now back again.” Lewis’s sub- 
conscious dutifully re-formed its 
owner. 

“Mm-mm,” Fletcher said to him- 
self. A glimmer of light was dawn- 
ing. 

When Lewis came to, he told 
him what had happened. 

“Your talent is a true reflex. It’s 
automatic. It responds to sugges- 
tion when your conscious control is 
relaxed. If we could get your 
memory back, you’d naturally re- 
member what your original shape 
was. But your memory is obvious- 
ly not going to yield easily. So, 
say we reverse the process. Say we 
experiment on finding your shape. 
It might take a hell of a while, but 
if we hit on it, it should trigger the 
rest of your memory." 

For the first time, something like 
elation came into Lewis’s eyes. 
“Yes. I thought of that myself — 
that if I could only get back my 
original shape— but I gave up the 
thought as hopeless when I found 
I couldn’t will it. But if you can 
do it-” 

Fletcher cut across his excite- 
ment. “Don’t be too optimistic. 
There’s no guarantee we’ll hit on 


118 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


it, for one thing. Another is that 
amnesia may be proof against that, 
too. But if I do hit it, if I do give 
your subconscious the right com- 
mand, it should create quite a stir 
in your psyche.” 

His smile was rather grim. 

"TkURING the next two weeks, 
Fletcher did a drastic stream- 
lining of his appointments book, 
putting off all but the most urgent 
and persistent cases. 

It was the most fantastic fort- 
night he had ever spent. He kept 
his consulting room locked and 
shuttered whenever Lewis was in 
there. And he was there most of 
the time. He was tough, physically 
and mentally, and kept coming 
back for more, in between demand- 
ing to be told all the shapes that 
Fletcher successively dictated to 
his subconscious. 

Fletcher set up every possible 
permutation and combination 
imaginable — but without a single 
response, except that Lewis’s sub- 
conscious went through the mo- 
tions as docilely as a trained seal. 
He did become a seal once — and 
every other creature in the world’s 
catalogue, except for an occasional 
gap. The first time that happened, 
Fletcher thought he had hit on the 
right shape. Then he found, to 
his disgust, that it was due to the 
simple fact that Lewis just didn’t 
have that particular creature in 
his stock of acquired knowledge. 


So when that happened, Fletcher 
described the creature, and Lewis 
took it from there. The same 
routine was followed with all the 
fantastic imaginary shapes that 
Fletcher thought up. For, in the 
second week, the Earth was left 
behind. Local magazine stores did 
an unusual trade in science fiction 
magazines, and hundreds of illus- 
trations took fleeting shape on 
Fletcher’s couch. 

Once, on Fletcher’s instruction 
to assume some particularly fan- 
tastic shape, the willing subject 
gave a groan, and Fletcher tensed. 
That was the kind of reaction he’d 
been praying for. But his hopes 
immediately evaporated, for, with 
a contented sigh, Lewis made it. 
It had been only a temporary con- 
structional difficulty. 

At the end of the fortnight, 
Fletcher was ready to give in. He 
told Lewis so. 

Lewis looked dismayed. 

“Well, can you think of any- 
thing else?” Fletcher challenged 
him, for Lewis had taken over the 
task of indexing. 

“No. Perhaps you can only get 
a response by an exact prompt— 
every detail, color and all.” 

“I know. That would put it on 
a par with the monkeys on the 
typewriters— a job for eternity. Be- 
fore I tackle that, I think I’ll take 
a look up in Oregon. I might get 
a clue there.” 

“I didn’t.”

“Maybe you were too close to 
it” 

“But — you won’t rouse any 
suspicion about me? I mean—” 
“Yes?” 

Lewis bit his lip. “I’m sorry.” 
“That’s all right. I’ll just say I’m 
a doctor handling your case. Strict- 
ly amnesia. I won’t mention the 
rest.” 

Lewis beamed. “Right. And 
while you’re away, I’ll really 
analyze those shapes, just in case 
we overlooked or forgot one.” 

"C 1 LETCHER went by plane. A 
bus from the airport took him 
to the construction job. The town- 
ship was nearly finished now, and 
most of the workers had been paid 
off. But he was lucky enough to 
contact the man who had found 
Lewis — a towering Irish foreman 
called Brannigan. 

“He was stark naked and lost,” 
Brannigan told him over a beer. 
“But he wasn’t any trouble. Doc 
checked him and passed him as 
okay. Apart from his loss of memo- 
ry or whatever it was. But he was 
a good worker, one of the best I 
ever had. Some of these good-for- 
nothing loafers, they—” 

Fletcher waited patiently through 
a long complaint about the present- 
day worker — it was obvious that 
Brannigan had been reared in 
tougher days— then said: “Did you 
ever find anything round about?” 
“Like what?” 


“Well, did your workmen ever 
turn up anything like— well, docu- 
ments, scraps of metal, anything? 
I’m trying to get a lead on Lewis’s 
real identity.” 

Brannigan scratched his head. 
“I didn’t hear of anything. We 
found a lot of Indian remains — 
pots, weapons, but nothing else. If 
anybody had, I’d have heard about 
it. And we cleared several miles 
around this project.” 

Fletcher sighed. “Okay, thanks.” 
On the plane back, he tried to 
add it up. But nothing plus nothing 
wasn’t a very profitable sum. He 
might be a moderately successful 
psychiatrist — on ordinary cases, 
anyway— but as a Sherlock Holmes 
he was definitely deficient, he 
thought with disgust. 

Then something clicked. Sher- 
lock Holmes . the dog in the 
night . the dog that didn’t bark. 
The spaceship that wasn’t there. 
That didn’t have to mean a thing, 
of course. If you could accept the 
fact of a man who could change 
shape and the conjecture of a 
spaceship, then you could accept 
a matter-transmitter, or whatever 
else writers employed to move 
their heroes between worlds. 

. But if there had been a space- 
ship, and there were no remains, 
that meant there hadn’t been a 
crash. That, in turn, meant that— 
By the time the plane touched 
down, Fletcher had explored a 
long avenue of conjecture. It had 


120 


GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 


kept branching off into realms of 
possibility that it would have been 
hopeless to follow. But, keeping to 
a path he could follow, he had 
tracked it out to the end, and at 
the end was one last possibility. 

Lewis was waiting for him glum- 
ly in his office. “I’ve analyzed all 
the shapes.” 

“Well?” 

Lewis shook his head sadly. 
“You covered the ground one hun- 
dred per cent.” 

“Only ninety-nine point nine 
nine nine,” Fletcher told him. 
“Ready for one more try?” 

Lewis nodded, a light of hope 
re-awakening in his eyes. 

“Mind you, it’s only a try,” 
Fletcher warned. “One try — after 
the thousands we’ve made already. 
So don’t expect too much.” 

Fletcher gave him a minimum 
dose, waited, then said the word. 

It worked. 

A CRY broke from the lips of 
the figure on the couch, ac- 
companied by a great writhing of 
features and of form. Nothing like 
this had ever happened before. 
Then the figure sighed and 
changed. Eyes looked sightlessly 
up at Fletcher; strange words broke 
from a newly shaped mouth. 

Fletcher waited tensely. 

The drug was thrown off. The 
body straightened up. The eyes 
gained focus. They also changed 
color — to violet — and the rest of 


the shape altered slightly as if 
changing from the general outline 
that had just been triggered to the 
particular, the original. 

“How do you feel?” Fletcher 
asked. 

“All right. It’s all so confusing, 
having it come back to me. But 
how did you guess?” The voice 
had changed, which wasn’t surpris- 
ing, but still spoke English per- 
fectly. 

“I’ll tell you. You just correct 
me if I’m wrong. All right? Oh . 
what do I call you now?” 

“Ruvil.” 

“Is that first name or last?” 

“Both.” 

“Right. Now — no trace of any 
spaceship was found near where 
you thought you had crashed. So 
I started figuring on what that 
meant. It could only mean that 
you were landed here by a ship 
that took off again. That, in turn, 
meant that you were already am- 
nesiac. That could have meant that 
you were just dumped here be- 
cause you were no longer any use 
as a member of the crew or what- 
ever. 

“But somehow I couldn’t con- 
ceive of a race with a culture that 
could build spaceships abandon- 
ing one of its members as callous- 
ly as that. But a race that could 
build spaceships could conceivably 
introduce an artificial amnesia into 
a subject. Artificial and perma- 
nent. Endangered by only one

thing — the talent that your spe- 
cies has for changing shape. 

“Now I tried to place myself 
in the skin of a creature of another 
world that I didn’t know a thing 
about. And I reasoned like this: 

“First, for some reason, powers 
on your world wanted you out of 
the way. But they were too hu- 
mane to kill you. Why didn’t they 
just dump you on another world? 
Because you had some knowledge 
that they feared you could use. 
So — without at this stage going 
into what that knowledge might be 
— they gave you this artificial 
memory block before they dumped 
you. 

“But there was always the dan- 
ger that you might get into a spot 
that would cause you to change 
to your original shape — and trig- 
ger your memory. Now the really 
tough part came. Why did they 
choose this planet? Because they 
had never visited it before? But 
perhaps they had — incognito. Per- 
haps they’re incognito on every 
world they visit, having the power 
they have. Obviously I couldn’t 
get far on that tack. 

“So then I pondered on just 
where on Earth they had dumped 
you. And then it clicked. They 
had left you with this artificial 
memory block — and probably in 
some neutral state, physically. You 
were just a blank, in mind and 
shape, when you saw a man ap- 
proach, as they figured was bound 


to happen before long. 

“Your reflex acted. You became 
a man — the one shape you would 
never have reason to change from 
into your original. At least, not 
foreseeably. I wondered whether 
the difference was such as to mat- 
ter. It obviously was.” 

R UVIL laughed now. “Believe 
me, it is. Didn’t you know 
that?” 

“On Earth, yes. Some men have 
said that your species is the most 
widely divergent from Man imag- 
inable. But one or two things still 
have me puzzled. Just what did 
you know that was so dangerous 
to your own kind?” 

Ruvil laughed again. “You 
know, that’s one thing that hasn’t 
come back yet. Anyway, I’m not 
worried. Oh, the intrigues back on 
Varn — that’s the name of my 
world. They’re extremely intelli- 
gent — and humane, as you cor- 
rectly diagnosed — but also slight- 
ly cockeyed. It seems that the 
more developed a culture you get, 
the bigger the neuroses.” 

“But why have they never vis- 
ited Earth? Openly, I mean.” 
“Because they never contact a 
world that’s already well on the 
way to space travel itself. When a 
race is at that point, it’s likely to 
go off the handle, before it gets 
its sights adjusted. There have 
been one or two unhappy incidents 
in the past. Yes, of course — that’s 


122

the knowledge they were fright- 
ened I’d use or pass on. Not the 
reason they banished me. That 
was some dreadful palace conspira- 
cy. I am — was — a member of 
one of the dynastic families back 
on Varn.” 

“But why didn’t they dump you 
on a more primitive world where 
your knowledge would be of no 
use to you?” asked Fletcher. 

“Because — well, because Vam 
ships are in regular contact with 
them, I suppose. They had to 
choose a world like Earth — and 
any other developed culture is al- 
ways humanoid. Yes, it was really 
clever of them to banish me here 
and to dump me in a practically 
all-man area. And — ” Ruvil’s violet 
eyes shone admiringly — “it was 
very clever of you to work it all 
out.” 

Fletcher coughed nervously and 
leaned back. “Yes, well . what 


are your plans now? To show us 
how to build spaceships and lead 
a fleet back to Vam?” 

Ruvil laughed tinklingly. “Of 
course not. They overestimated the 
attention I paid to my lessons at 
school. I wouldn’t know how to 
start. Besides, what would / want 
with spaceships?” 

Ruvil stretched luxuriously, and 
Fletcher had to admit that, in with 
such other obvious endowments, a 
knowledge of spaceship construc- 
tion would have been rather re- 
dundant. 

“No.” Ruvil smoothed her long 
golden hair with delicate fingers. 
“There’s lots of other Varnian lore 
that’s much more worth knowing.” 
She got up from the couch in 
one lithe movement, far too quick- 
ly for Fletcher to have moved, 
even if he had wanted to. “For 
instance . .”

O N T 1 1 B P L A N B T "SO L- 
A HI A” Earthman Elijah 
Haley should NOT have blushed 
to the ears when beautiful Glad- 
ia Delinarre casually stepped 
out of her shower to talk with 
him! For ail Solarians CON- 
SIDERED THAT ENTIRELY 
PROPER . because their so- 
cial contacts were carried on by 
VIEWING through two-way 
television. 

And just as Elijah (an Earth- 
man brought up in under- 
ground cities) was terrified by 
Solaria's naked sun, the Solar- 
ians dreaded mingling with 
other lll'MANS. Physical con- 
tact was “in of the question. 
Even DISCUSSING such things 
was obscene! 

That's why Elijah had gcod 
reason to be shocked when 
Gladia actually allowed him to 
SEE HER IN PERSON when 


she brazenly reached out her 
naked fingers to TOUCH HIM! 

Then* was no doubt left in his 
mind that there was something 
unspeakably strange about this 
exotic temptress. Hut it was be- 
coming more and more difficult 
for Elijah to admit — even to 
himself— that she was his prime 
suspect in a fa ntastically sordid 
murder ! 

You’ll thrill to THE NAKED 
SUN by Isaac Asimov . just 
ONE of the SIX exciting books 
in this amazing offer!
