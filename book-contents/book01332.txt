WHY THE EARTH ISNT ROUND 



T ime was when everyone knew 
that the Earth was flat — after 
all, you could look at it and see 
its flatness for yourself. Then 
along came Eratosthenes to say it 
was round, and prove it by meas- 
uring the height of the sun at mid- 
day in two locations. (The see-for- 
yourself people didn^t really believe 
him, wherefore the world went right 
back to assuming it was flat for 
another thousand years or more; 
but ' that's only a detail ; he was 
right, and sooner or later Galileo, 
Giordano Bruno and others came 
along to confirm what he said.) 
Then, quite recently as historical 
time (goes, the great geodetic sur- 
veys of the last hundred years re- 
vealed that it was not a sphere but 
what we learned in school to call 
an oblate spheroid. 

All of this was reasonably satis- 
factory and comfortable for most 
people — once they'd got over 
the first instinctive horror at 
concluding our enormous Earth was 
only a little pebble rolling around a 



vast and empty universe, anyway. 
It all made sense. The Earth spins, 
right? We know that spinning ob- 
jects bulge out at their equators 
if they can — that is, if the centri- 
fugal force generated exceeds the 
rigidity of the object. So naturally 
our Earth bulges too — 

Only it shouldn't bulge as much 
as it does. 

Unless we're very wrong in some 
basic assumptions, we know quite 
accurately how much it should bulge. 
The radius of the Earth at the 
equator ought to be about 13.4 miles 
more than at the poles. 

But it isn't exactly. We now 
have a chance to measure this rad- 
ius with great precision by track- 
ing the orbits of the hundreds of 
manmade satellites we've put up 
. and the confounded thing bulges 
230 feet more than it ought to. 

How much of a difference does 
that make? 

Up at the Smithsonian Astrophy- 
sical Observatory a fellow named 
E. M. Gaposchkin puts it this way:

A RE the tales of stwnge^hi^an pow- 
ers false? Can the^mystefipus feats 
erformed by the mystics of the Orient 
e explained away as only illusions? Is 
there an intangible bond with the uni- 
verse beyond which draws mankind 
on? Does a mighty Cosmic intelligence 
from the reaches of space ebb and flow 
through the deep recesses of the mind, 
forming a river of wisdom which can 
carry men and women to the heights 
of personal achievement? 

Have You Had These 
Experiences?

have taken the wrong course of action, 
that you have violated some inner, un- 
expressed, better judgement? The sud- 
den realization that me silent whisper-

your own counsel— not to speak words 
on the tip of your tongue in the pres- 
ence of another. That something which 
pushes you forward when you hesitate, 
or restrains you when you are apt to 
make a wrong move. 



lliese urges are the subtle influence 
which when understood and directed 
has made thousands of men and women 
masters of their lives. There IS a source 
of intelligence within you as natural as 
your senses of sight and hearing, and

“Tlie Earth has in fact the shape 
that it would have in theory if it 
rotated so fast that a day was 23^/^ 
instead of 24 hours long.” 

Further, Gaposchkin points out, 
there is some pretty good evidence 
to believe that at a point in the 
geological past, perhaps fifty mil- 
lion years ago. Earth’s day was 23^ 
hours. Could there be some sort of 
50-million-year time lag involved? 
We don’t know; but Gaposckin adds, 
‘‘We do know though, that the force 
which produced that extra oblate- 
ness, and is therefore in a sense 
trapped in it, is about 2x 1034 ergs 
. enough ... to raise the temper- 
ature of all of the oceans by 720® 
Fahrenheit, right now.” 

I nteresting? We thought so; and 
it led us to wonder about some- 
thing else. 

The resistance produced when 
one object is rubbed against an- 
other is called friction; to us it 
looks mostly like a uniform force, 
which we measure in terms of the 
drag of an aircraft winig, the brak- 
ing distance of a car under varying 
conditions of speed, road surface, 
tires, and so on, etc. 

Careful study has shown us, 
though, that on the microscopic scale 
the friction between two solids isn’t 
aU that uniform. It appears to oper- 
ate in a sort of stick-slip progres- 
sion, with the two surfaces alter- 
nately microwelding to each other 
land breaking free, welding and 
breaking) free again. So what ap- 
pears to the eye as a uniform de- 
celeration is, to a micro-observer, 
perhaps better described as a series 
of jolting shocks, dizzying slides, 
crunching halts and brief periods of 
stability. 

You might even say that the 
micro-observer would think himself 



involved in tectonic activity ... a 
sort of great San Francisco earth- 
quake that goes on and on. 

And now we wonder this: Sup- 
pose on our macroscopic scale the 
same sort of stick-slip resistance is 
happening, at intervals of eons in- 
stead of microseconds. Suppose the 
Earth’s crust at some point in time 
gives up the struggle for rigidity, 
sighs, relaxes its grip and allows 
that accumulated 230-foot equatorial 
hump to assume its proper shape 
. releasing all those 2 x 1034 
ergs in the form of heat. 

And suppose, right about then or 
shortly afterward in the macro-time 
scale, some curious extraterrestrials 
send a space probe past the Earth 
to see what it’s like. They mght even 
call it Mariner II. 

What a devil of time they would 
have, trying to account for the 
temperatures and pressures they 
would find! 

P ersonal note: The other day we 
made an informal study of 
stick-slip effects as they apply to 
automobile brakes on slippery roads. 
The results were inconclusive, but 
not altogether unpleasant: we sur- 
vived. 

However we are now, and will be 
for some months in the future, 
wearing a handsome plaster oast 
on the left arm, on which we have 
inscribed the Eleventh Command- 
ment. (“Keep thy seat belt fastened, 
chowderhead, if thou wouldst have 
thy days long on this Earth.”) 

To those who have sent us ex- 
pressions of sympathy and so on, 
our appreciation . and apologies. 
We’d like to answer each letter in- 
dividually, but — well, have 3 rou 
ever (for instance) tried to change 
a typewriter ribbon with one hand?

WIZARD'S 

WORLD 

by ANDRE NORTON 

Illustrated dy MORROW 



The woman was a witch — no surprise 
on this mad planet where wizardry 
ruled and death lurked everywhere! 



I 

C raike’s swollen feet were agony, 
every breath he drew fought 
a hot band imprisoning his la- 
boring lungs. He clung weakly to 
a rough spur of rock in the canyon 
wall, swayed against it, raking his 
flesh raw on the stone. That weath- 
ered red and yellow rock was no 



more unyielding than the murder- 
ous wills behind him. And the stab 
of pain in his calves no less than 
the pain of their purpose in his 
dazed mind. 

He had been on the run so long, 
ever since he had left the E-Camp. 
But until last night — no, two 
nights ago — when he had given 
himself away at the gas station, he 



7 




had not known what it was to be 
actually hunted. The will-to-kill 
which fanned from those on his 
trail was so intense it shocked his 
Esper senses, panicking him com- 
pletely. 

Now he was trapped in wild 
country, and he was city born. Wa- 
ter — Craike flinched at the 
thought of water. Espers should con- 
trol their bodies, that was what he 
had been taught. But there come 
times when cravings of the flesh 
triumph over will. 

He winced, and the spur grated 
against his half-naked breast. They 
had a “hound” on him right 
enough. And that brain-twisted Es- 
per slave who fawned and served 
the mob masters would have no dif- 
ficulty in trailing him straight to 
any pocket into which he might 
crawl. A last remnant of rebellion 
sent Craike reeling on over the 
gravel of the long-dried stream 
bed. 

Espers had once been respected 
for their “wild talents,” then tol- 
erated warily. Now they were used 
under guard for slave labor. And 
the day was coming soon when the 
fears of the normals would demand 
their extermination. They had been 
trying to prepare against that. 

First they had worked openly, 
petitioning to be included in space- 
ship crews, to be chosen for col- 
onists on the Moon and Mars; then 
secretly when they realized the 
norms had no intention of allowing 
that. Their last hope was flight to 
the waste spots of the world, those 
refuse places resulting from the 
same atomic wars which had 
8 



brought about the birth of their 
kind. 

Craike had been smuggled out 
of an eastern E-Camp provided 
with a cover, sent to explore the 
ravaged area about the one-time 
city of Reno. Only he had broken 
his cover for the protection of a 
girl, only to learn, too late, shp was 
bait for an Esper trap. He had 
driven a stolen speeder until the 
last drop of fuel was gone, and af- 
ter that he had kept blindly on, 
running, until now. 

The contact with the Esper 
“hound” was clear; they must al- 
most be in sight behind. Craike 
paused. They were not going to 
take him alive, wring from him 
knowledge of his people, recondi- 
tion him into another “hound.” 
There was only one way, he should 
have known that from the first. 

His decision had shaken the 
“hound.” Craike bared teeth in a 
death’s-head grin. Now the mob 
would speed up. But their quarry 
had already chosen a part of the 
canyon wall where he might pull 
his tired and aching body up from 
one hold to another. He moved de- 
liberately now, knowing that when 
he had lost hope, he could throw 
aside the need for haste. He would 
be able to accomplish his purpose 
before they brought a gas rifle to 
bear on him. 

A t last he stood on a ledge, the 
sand and gravel some fifty 
feet below. For a long moment he 
rested, steadying himself with both 
hands braced on the stone. The 
weird beauty of the desert country 

IF 




was a pattern of violent color un- 
der the afternoon sun. Craike 
breathed slowly; he had regained a 
measure of control. There came 
shouts as they sighted him. 

He leaned forward and, as if he 
were diving into the river which 
had once run there, he hurled him- 
self outward to the clean death he 
sought. 

Water, water in his mouth! 
Dazed, he flailed water until his 
head broke surface. Instinct took 
over, and he swam, fought for air. 
The current of the stream pulled 
him against a boulder collared with 
froth, and he arched an arm over 
it, lifting himself, to stare about in 
stupified bewilderment. 

He was close to one bank of 
a river. Where the colorful cliff of 
the canyon had been there now 
rolled downs thickly covered with 
green growth. The baking heat of 
the desert had vanished; there was 
even a slight chill in the air. 

Dumbly Craike left his rock an- 
chorage and paddled ashore, to lie 
shivering on sand while the sun 
warmed his battered body. What 
HAD happened? When he tried to 
make sense of it, the effort hurt 
his mind almost as much as had 
the “hound’s” probe. 

The Esper Hound! Craike jerked 
up, old panic stirring. First deli- 
cately and then urgently, he cast 
a thought-seek about him. There 
was life in plenty. He touched, clas- 
sified and disregarded the flickers 
of awareness which mingled in con- 
fusion — animals, birds, river dwell- 
ers. But nowhere did he meet in- 
telligence approaching his own. A 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



wilderness world without man as 
far as Esper ability could reach. 

Craike relaxed. Something had 
happened. He was too tired, too 
drained to speculate as to what. It 
was enough that he was saved from 
the death he had sought, that he 
was HERE instead of THERE. 

He got stiffly to his feet. Time 
was the same, he thought — late 
afternoon. Shelter, food — he set 
off along the stream. He found and 
ate berries spilling from bushes 
where birds raided before him. 
Then squatting above a side eddy 
of the stream, he scooped out a 
fish, eating the flesh raw. 

The land along the river was 
rising, he could see the beginning 
of a gorge ahead. Later, when he 
had clinubed those heights, he 
caught sight through the twilight 
of the fires. Four of them burning 
some miles to the southwest, set 
out in the form of a square! 

Craike sent out a thought probe. 
Yes — men! But an alien touch. 
This was no hunting mob. And he 
was drawn to the security of the 
fires, the camp of men in the dan- 
gers of the night. Only, as Esper, 
he was not one with them but an 
outlaw. And he dare not risk join- 
ing them. 

He retraced his path to the river 
and holed up in a hollow not large 
enough to be termed a cave. Auto- 
matically he probed again for dan- 
ger. Found nothing, but animal life. 
He slept at last, drugged by exhaus- 
tion of mind and body. 

T he sky was gray when he 
roused, swung cramped arms, 

9 




stretched. Craike had awakened 
with the need to know more of that 
camp. He climbed once again to the 
vantage point, shut his eyes to the 
early morning and sent out a seek- 
ing. 

A camp of men far from home. 
But they were not hunters. Mer- 
chants — traders! Craike located 
one mind among the rest, read in 
it the details of a bargain to come. 
Merchants from another country, 
a caravan. But a sense of separa- 
tion grew stronger as the fugitive 
Esper sorted out thought streams, 
absorbed scraps of knowledge 
thirstily. A herd of burden-bearing 
animals, nowhere any indication of 
machines. He sucked in a deep 
breath — he was ■ — he was in an- 
other world! 

Merchants traversing a wil- 
derness — a wilderness? Though 
he had been driven into desert the 
day before, the land through which 
he had earlier fled could not be 
termed a wilderness. It was over- 
populated because there were too 
many war-poisoned areas where 
mankind could not live. 

But from these strangers he gain- 
ed a concept of vast, barren terri- 
tory broken only by small, sparse, 
strips of cultivation. Craike hur- 
ried. They were breaking camp. 
And the impression of an unpeo- 
pled land they had given him made 
him want to trail the caravan. 

There was trouble! An’ attack — 
the caravan animals stampeded. 
Craike received a startlingly vivid 
mind picture of a hissing, lizard 
thing he could not identify. But it 
was danger on four scaled feet. He 
10 



winced at the fear in those minds 
ahead. There was a vigor of men- 
tal broadcast in these men which 
amazed him. Now, the lizard thing 
had been killed. But the pack ani- 
mals were scattered. It would take 
hours to find them. The exaspera- 
tion of the master trader was as 
strong to Craike as if he stood be- 
fore the man and heard his out- 
burst of complaint. 

The Esper smiled slowly. Here — 
handed to him by Fate — was his 
chance to gain the good will of the 
travelers. Breaking contact with the 
men, Craike cast around probe 
webs, as a fisher might cast a net. 
One panic crazed animal and then 
another — he touched minds, sooth- 
ed, brought to bear his training. 
Within moments he heard the dull 
thud of hooves on the mossy 
ground, no longer pounding in a 
wild gallop. A shaggy mount, nei- 
ther pony nor horse of his knowl- 
edge, but like in ways of each, its 
dull hide marked with a black 
stripe running from the root of 
shaggy mane to the base of its 
tail, came toward him, nickered 
questionly. And then fell behind 
Craike, to be joined by another 
and another, as the Esper walked 
on — until he led the full train of 
runaways. 

H e met the first of the caravan 
men within a quarter of a 
mile and savored the fellow’s as- 
tonishment at the sight. Yet, after 
the first surprise the man did not 
appear too amazed. He was short, 
dark of skin, a black beard of wiry, 
tightly curled hair clipped to a 

IF 




point thrusting out from his chin. 
Leggings covered his limhs, and he 
wore a sleeveless jerkin laced with 
thongs. This was belted by a broad 
strap gaudy with painted designs, 
from which hung a cross-hilted 
sword and a knife almost as long. 
A peaked cap of silky white fur 
was drawn far down so that a 
front flap shaded his eyes, and an- 
other, longer strip brushed his 
shoulders. 

“Many thanks, Man of Power 
— ” the words he spoke were in a 
clicking tongue, but Craike read 
their meaning mind to mind. 

Then, as if puzzled on his closer 
examination of the Esper, the 
stranger frowned, his indecision 
slowly turning hostile. 

“Outlaw! Begone, horned one!” 
The trader made a queer gesture 
with two fingers. “We pass free 
from your spells — ” 

“Be not so quick to pass judg- 
ment, Alfric — 

The newcomer was the Mas- 
ter Trader. As his man, he wore 
leather, but there was a gemmed 
clasp on his belt. His sword and 
knife hilt were of precious metal, 
as was a badge fastened to the 
fore of his yellow and black fur 
head gear. 

“This one is no local outlaw.” 
The MastSir stood, feet apart, study- 
ing the fugitive Esper as if he were 
a burden pony offered as a bar- 
gain. “Would such use his power 
for our aid? If he is a horned one — 
he is unlike any I have seen.” 

“I am not what you think — ” 
Craike said slowly, fitting his tongue 
to the others* alien speech. 

12 



The Master Trader nodded. 
“That is true. And you intend us 
no hann; does not the sun-stone so 
testify?” His hand went to the 
badge on his cap. “In this one is 
no evil, Alfric, rather does he come 
to us in aid. Have I not spoken 
the truth to you, stranger from the 
wastes?** 

Craike broadcast good will as 
strongly as he could. And they must 
have been somewhat influenced by 
that. 

“I feel — he DOES have the 
power!” Alfric burst forth. 

“He has power,*’ the Master cor- 
rected him. “But has he striven to 
possess our minds as he could do? 
We are still our own men. No — 
this is no renegade Black Hood. 
Come!” 

He beckoned to Craike, and the 
Esper, the animals still behind him, 
followed on into the camp where 
the rest of the men seized upon the 
ponies to adjust their packs. 

The Master filled a bowl from the 
contents of a three-legged pot set 
in the coals of a dying fire. Craike 
gulped an excellent and filling 
stew. When he had done, the Mas- 
ter indicated himself. 

“I am Kaluf of the Children of 
Noe, a far trader and trail mas- 
ter. Is it your will, Man of Power, 
to travel this road with us?” 

Craike nodded. This might all be 
a wild dream. But he was willing to 
see it to its end. A day with the 
Caravan, the chance to gather more 
information from the men here, 
should give him some inkling as to 
what had happened to him and 
where he now was. 



IF 




II 



C raike’s day with the traders be- 
came two and then three. Es- 
per talents were accepted by this 
company matter-of-factly, even 
asked in aid. And from the travel- 
ers he gained a picture of this world 
which he could not reconcile with 
his own. 

His first impression of a large 
continent broken by widely separ- 
ated holdings of a frontier type re- 
mained. In addition there was 
knowledge of a feudal government, 
petty lordlings holding title to lands 
over men of lesser birth. 

Kaluf and his men had a mild 
contempt for their customers. Their 
own homeland lay to the southeast, 
where, in some coastal cities, they 
had built up an overseas trade, re- 
taining its cream for their own 
consumption, peddling the rest in 
the barbarous hinterland. Craike, 
his facility in their click speech 
growing, asked questions which the 
Master answered freely enough. 

“These inland men know no dif- 
ference between Saludian silk and 
the weaving of the looms in our 
own Kormonian quarter.” He 
shrugged in scorn at sudh ignor- 
ance. “Why should we offer Salud 
wihen we can get Salud prices for 
Kormon lengths and the buyer is 
satisfied? Maybe — if these lords 
ever finish their private quarrels 
and live at peace so that there is 
more travel and they themselves 
come to visit in Larud or the other 
cities of the Children of Noe, then 
shall we not make a profit on lesser 
goods.” 

WIZARD'S WORLD 



“Do these Lords never try to 
raid your caravans?” 

Kaluf laughed. “They tried that 
once or twice. Certainly they saw 
there was the profit in seizing a 
train and paying nothing. But we 
purchased trail rights from the 
Black Hoods, and there was no 
more trouble. How is it with you, 
Ka-rak? Have you lords in your 
land who dare to stand against the 
power of the Hooded Ones?” 

Craike, taking a chance, nodded. 
And knew he had been right when 
some reserve in Kaluf vanished. 

“That explains much, perhaps 
even why such a man of power as 
you should be adrift in the wilder- 
ness. But you need not fear in this 
country, your brothers hold com- 
plete rule — ” 

A colony of Espers! Craike 
tensed. Had he, through some weird 
chance, found here the long-hoped- 
for refuge of his kind. But where 
was here? His old bewilderment was 
lost in a shout from the fore of 
the train. 

“The outpost has sighted us and 
raised the trade banner.” Kaluf 
quickened pace. “Within the hour 
we’ll be at the walls of Sampur. 
lUifl” 

/^raike made for the head of the 
line. Sampur, by the reckoning 
of the train, was a city of respect- 
able size, the domain of a Lord Lu- 
dicar with whom Kaluf had had 
mutually satisfactory dealings for 
some time. And the Master antici- 
pated a profitable stay. But the 
man who had ridden out to greet 
them was full of news. 



13 




Racially he was unlike the trad- 
ers, taller, longer of arm. His bare 
chest was a thatch of blond-red 
hair as thick as a bear’s pelt, long 
braids swung across his shoulders. 
A leather cap, reinforced with sewn 
rings of metal was crammed down 
over his wealth of hair, and he 
carried a shield slung from his sad- 
dle pad. In addition to sword and 
knife, he nursed a spear in the 
crook of his arm, from the point 
of which trailed a banner strip of 
blue stuff. 

“You come in good time. Mas- 
ter. The Hooded Ones have pro- 
claimed a horning, and all the out- 
bounders have gathered as witness- 
es. This is a good day for your 
trading, the Oloudy Ones have in- 
deed favored you. But hurry, the 
Lord Ludicar is now riding in and 
soon there will be no good place 
from which to watch — ” 

Craike fell back. Punishment? 
An execution? No, not quite that. 
He wished he dared ask questions. 
Certainly the picture which had 
leaped into Kalufs mind at the 
mention of “horning” could not be 
true! 

Caution kept the Esper aloof. 
Sooner or later his alien origin 
must be noted, though Kaluf had 
supplied him with a fur cap, leath- 
er jerkin, and boots from the cara- 
van surplus. 

The ceremony was to take place 
just outside the main gate of the 
stockade, which formed the outer 
rampart of the town. A group of 
braided, ring-helmed warriors hem- 
med in a more imposing figure 
with a feather plume and a blue 
14 



cloak, doubtless Lord Ludicar. 
Thronging at a respectful distance 
were the townfolk. But they were 
merely audience; the actors stood 
apart. 

Craike’s hands went to his head. 
The emotion which beat at him 
from that party brought the metal- 
lic taste of fear to his mouth, arous- 
ed his own memories. Then he 
steadied, probed. There was terror 
there, broadcast from two figures 
under guard. Just as an impact of 
Esper power came from the three 
black-hooded men who walked be- 
hind the captives. 

He used his own talent carefully, 
dreading to attract the attention of 
the men in black. The townsfolk 
opened an aisle in their ranks, giv- 
ing free passage to the open moor- 
land and the green stretch of for- 
est not too far away. 

Fear — in one of those bound, 
stumbling prisoners it was abject, 
the same panic which had hound- 
ed Craike into the desert. But, 
though the other captive had no 
hope, there was a thick core of de- 
fiance, a desperate desire to strike 
back. And something in Craike 
arose to answer that. 

Othei> men, wearing black jerkins 
and no hoods, crowded about the 
prisoners. When they stepped back 
Craike saw that the drab clothing 
of the two had been torn away. 
Shame, blotting out fear, came from 
the smaller captive. And there was 
no mistaking the sex of the curves 
that white body displayed. A girl, 
and very young. A violent shake of 
her head loosened her hair to flow, 
black and long, clothing her naked- 

IF 




ness. Craike drew a deep breath as 
he had before that plunge into the 
canyon. Moving quickly he crouch- 
ed behind a bush. 

The Black Hoods went about 
their business with dispatch, each 
drawing in turn certain designs and 
lines in the dust of the road until 
they had created an intricate pat- 
tern about the feet of the prisoners. 

A chant began in which the 
townspeople joined. The fear of the 
male captive was an almost visible 
cloud. But the outrage and anger of 
his feminine companion grew in re- 
lation to the chant, and Craike 
could sense her will battling against 
that of the assembly. 

r ie watching Esper gasped. He 
could not be seeing what his 
eyes reported to his brain! The 
man was down on all fours, his legs 
and arms stretched, a mist clung 
to them, changed to red-brown hide. 
His head lengthened oddly, horns 
sprouted. No man, but an antlered 
stag stood there. 

And the girl — ? 

Her transformation came more 
slowly. It began and then faded. 
The power of the Black Hoods 
held her, fastening on her the form 
they visualized. She fought. But in 
the end a white doe sprang down 
the path to the forest, the stag 
leaping before her. They whipped 
past the bush where Craike had 
gone to earth, and he was able to 
see through the illusion. Not a red 
stag and a White doe, but a man 
and woman running for their lives, 
yet already knowing in their hearts 
there was no hope in their flight. 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



Craike, hardly knowing why he 
did it or who he could aid, follow- 
ed, sure that mind touch would pro- 
vide him with a guide. 

He had reached the murky 
shadow of the trees when a sound 
rang from the town. At its sum- 
moning he missed a step before he 
realized it was directed against those 
he trailed and not himself. A hunt- 
ing horn! So this world also had its 
hunted and its hunters. More than 
ever he determined to aid those 
who fled. 

But it was not enough to just 
run blindly on the track of stag 
and doe. He lacked weapons. And 
his wits had not sufficed to save 
him in his own world. But there he 
had been conditioned against turn- 
ing on his hunters, hampered, cruel- 
ly designed from birth to accept 
the quarry role. That was not true 
here. 

Esper power — Craike licked dry 
lips. Illusions so well done they 
had almost enthralled him. Could 
illusion undo what illusion had 
done? Again the call of the horn, 
ominous in its clear tone, rang in 
his ears, set his pulses to pounding. 
The fear of those who fled was a 
cord, drawing him on. 

But as he trotted among the 
trees Craike concentrated on his 
own illusion. It was not a white 
doe he pursued but the slim, young 
figure he had seen when they strip- 
ped away the clumsy stuff which 
had cloaked her, before she had 
shaken loose her hair veil. No doe, 
but a woman. She was not racing 
on four hooved feet, but running 
free on two, her hair blowing be- 

15 




hind her. No doe, hut a maidi 

And in that moment, as he con- 
structed tihat picture clearly, he 
contacted her in thought. It was like 
•being dashed by sea-spray, cool, 
remote, very clean. And, as spray, 
the contact vanished in an instant, 
only to returm 

“Who are you?” 

“One who follows,” he answered, 
holding to his picture of the run- 
ning girl. 

“Follow no more, you have done 
what was needful?” There was a 
burst of joy, so overwhelming a re- 
lease from terror that it halted him. 
Then the cord between them broke. 

Frantically Craike cast about 
seeking contact. There was only a 
dead wall. Lost, he put out a hand 
to the rough bark of the nearest 
tree. Wood things lurked here, 
then only did his mind touch. What 
did he do now? 

His decision was made for him. 
He picked up a wave of panic 
again — spreading terror. But this 
was the fear of feathered and furred 
things. It came to him as ripples 
might run on a pool. 

Fire! He caught the thought dis- 
torted by bird and beast mind. Fire 
which leaped from tree crown to 
tree crown, cutting a gash across 
the forest. Craike started on, tak- 
ing the way west, away from the 
menace. 

Once he called out as a deer 
flashed by him, only to know in 
the same moment that this was no 
illusion but an animal. Small crea- 
tures tunnelled through the grass. 
A dog fox trotted, spared him a 
measuring gaze from slit eyes. 
16 



Birds whirred, and behind them was 
the scent of smoke. 

A mountain of flesh, muscle and 
fur snarled, reared to face him. But 
Craike had nothing to fear from 
any animal. He confronted the great 
red bear until it whined, shuffled 
its feet and plodded on. More and 
more creatures crossed his path or 
ran beside him for a space. 

It was their instinct which 
brought them, and Craike, to a riv- 
er. Wolves, red deer, bears, great 
cats, foxes and all the rest came 
down to the saving water. A cat 
spat at the flood, but leaped in to 
swim. Craike lingered on the bank. 
The smoke was thicker, more ani- 
mals broke from the wood to take 
to the water. But the doe — where 
was she? 

He probed, only to meet that 
blank. Then a spurt of flame ran 
up a dead sapling, advance scout of 
the furnace. He yelped as a float- 
ing cinder stung his skin and took 
to the water. But he did not cross, 
rather did he swim upstream, hop- 
ing to pass the flank of the fire and 
pick up the missing trail again. 

Ill 

S moke cleared as Craike trod wa- 
ter. He was beyond the path of 
the fire, but not out of danger. For 
the current against which he had 
fought his way beat here through 
an archway of masonry. Flanking 
that arch were two squat towers. 
As an erection it was far more am- 
bitious than anything he had seen 
during his brief glimpse of Sampur. 
Yet, as he eyed it more closely, he 

IF 




could see it was a ruin. There were 
gaps in the narrow span across the 
river, a green hush sprouted from 
the summit of the far tower. 

Craike came ashore, winning his 
way up the steep bank by hand- 
holds of vine and bush no alert cas- 
tellan would have allowed to grow. 
As he reached a terrace of cobbles 
stippled with bunches of coarse 
grass, a sweetish scent of decay 
drew him around the base of the 
tower to look down at a broad 
ledge extending into the river. Piled 
on it were small baskets and bowls, 
some so rotted that only outlines 
were visible. Others new and all 
filled with mouldering food stuffs. 
But those who left such offerings 
must have known that the tower 
was deserted. 

Puzzled Craike went back to the 
building. The stone was undressed, 
yet the huge blocks which formed 
its base were fitted together with 
such precision that he suspected he 
could not force the thin blade of 
a pocket knife into any crack. 
There had been no effort at orna- 
mentation, at any lighting of the 
impression of sullen, brute force. 

Wood, split and insect bored, 
formed a door. As he put his hand 
to it Craike discovered the guardi- 
an the lonig-ago owners of the for- 
tress had left in possession. His 
hands went to his head, the blow 
he felt might have been physical. 
Out of the stronghold before him 
came such a wave of utter terror 
and dark promise as to force him 
back. But no farther than the edge 
of the paved square about the 
building’s foundation. 

WIZARD'S WORLD 



Grimly he faced that challenge, 
knowing it for stored emotion and 
not the weapon of an active will. 
He had his own defense against 
such a formless enemy. Breaking a 
dead branch from a bush, he twist- 
ed about it whisps of the sun-bleach- 
ed grass until he had a torch of 
sorts. A piece of smoldering tinder 
blown from the fire gave him a 
light. 

Craike put his shoulder to the 
powdery remnants of the door, 
bursting it wide. Light against dark. 
What lurked there was nourished by 
dark, fed upon the night fears of 
his species. 

A round room, bare except for 
some crumbling sticks of wood, a 
series of steps jutting out from the 
wall to curl about and vanish above. 
Craike made no move toward fur- 
ther exploration, holding up the 
torch, seeking to see the real, not 
the threat of this place. 

Those who had built it possessed 
Esper talents. And they had used 
that power for twisted purposes. 
He read terror and despair trapped 
here by the castellans* art, horror, 
an abiding fog of what his race con- 
sidered evil. 

Tentatively Craike began to fight. 
With the torch he brought light and 
heat into the dark and cold. Now 
he struggled to offer peace. Just as 
he had pictured a girl in flight in 
place of the doe, so did he now 
force upon those invisible clouds of 
stored suffering calm and hope. 
The gray window slits in the stone 
were uncurtained to the streaming 
sunlight. 

Those who had set that guardian 

17 




had oot intended it to hold against 
aa Esper. Once he began the task, 
Craice found the opposition melt- 
ing. The terror seep^ as if it sank 
into the floor wave by wave. He 
stood in a room which smelt of 
damp and, more faintly, of the rot- 
ting food piled below its window 
slits; but now it was only an empty 
shell. 

Craike was tired, drained by his 
effort. And he was puzzled. Why 
had he fought for this? Of what im- 
portance to him was the cleansing 
of a ruined tower? 

Though to stay here had certain 
advantages. It had been erected to 
control river traffic. Though that did 
no^ matter for the present, just now 
he needed food more — 

H e went back to the rock of of- 
ferings, treading a wary path 
through the disintegrating stuff. 
Close to the edge he came upon a 
clay bowl containing coarsely 
ground grain and, beside it, a bas- 
ket of wilted leaves filled with over- 
ripe berries. He ate in gulps. 

Grass made him a matted bed in 
the tower, and he kindled a fire. 
As he squatted before its flames, 
he sent out a questing thought. A 
big cat drank from the river. Craike 
shuddered away from that contract 
with blood lust. A nigjht-hunting 
bird provided a trace of awareness. 
There were small rovers and hunt- 
ers. But nothing human. 

Tired as he was Craike could not 
sleep. There was the restless sensa- 
tion of some demand about to be 
made, some task waiting. From 
time to time he fed the fire. To- 
18 



wards morning he dozed, to snap 
awake. A night creature drinking, 
a screech overhead. He heard the 
flutter of wings echo hollowly 
through the tower. 

Beyond — darkness — blank, 
that curious blank which had fallen 
between him and the girl. Craike 
got to his feet eagerly. That blank 
could be traced. 

Outside it was raining, and fog 
hung in murky bands among the 
river hollows. The blank spot veer- 
ed. Craike started after it. The tow- 
er pavement became a trace of old 
road he followed, weaving through 
the fog. 

There was the sour smell of old 
smoke. Charred wood, black muck 
clung to his feet. But his guide 
point was now stationary as the 
ground rose, studded with outcrops 
of rock. So Craike came to a mesa 
jutting up into a steel gray sky. 

He hitched his way up by way 
of a long-ago slide. The rain had 
stopped, but there was no hint of 
sun. And he was unprepared for 
the greeting he met as he topped 
the lip of a small plateau. 

A violent blow on the shoulder 
whirled him half-way around, and 
only by a finger’s width did he es- 
cape a fall. A cry echoed his, and 
the blank broke. She was there. 

Moving slowly, using the same 
technique he knew to sooth fright- 
ened animals, Craike raised himself 
again. The pain in his shoulder was 
sharp when he tried to put much 
weight upon his left arm. But now 
he saw her clearly. 

She sat cross-legged, a boulder 
at her back, her hair a rippling 

IF 




cloud of black ( through which her 
hands and arms shown starkly 
white. She had the thin, three-cor- 
nered face of a child who has known 
much harshness; there was no beau- 
ty there — the flesh had been too 
much worn by spirit. Only her eyes, 
watohful-wary as those of a feline, 
considered him bleakly. In spite of 
his beam of good will, she gave him 
no welcome. And she tossed an- 
other stone from hand to hand with 
the ease of one who had already 
scored with such a weapon. 

“Who are you?” she spoke aloud. 

“He who followed you,” Craike 
fingered the bruise wound on his 
shoulder, not taking his eyes from 
hens. 

“You are no Black Hood.” It 
was a statement not a question. 
“But you, also, have been horned.” 
Another statement. 

Craike nodded. In his own time 
and place he had indeed been 
“horned.” 

Just as her thrown stone had 
struck without warning, so came 
her second attack. There was a hiss. 
Within striking distance a snake 
flickered a forked tongue. 

Craike did not give ground. The 
snake head expanded, fur ran over 
it; there were legs, a plume of tail 
fluffed. A dog fox yapped once at 
the girl and vanished. Craike read 
her recoil, the first faint uncertain- 
ty- 

“You have the power!” 

“I have power,” he corrected 
her. 

But her attention was no longer 
his. She was listening to something 
he could hear with neither ear nor 
WIZARD^S WORLD 



mind. Then she ran to the edge of 
the mesa. He followed. 

O n this side the country was 
more rolling, and across it 
now came mounted men moving in 
and out of mist pools. They rode in 
silence, and over them was the same 
blanketing of thought as the girl 
had used. 

Craike glanced about. There 
were loose stones, and the girl had 
already proven her marksmanship 
with such. But they would be no 
answer to the weapons the others 
had. Only flight was no solution 
either. 

The girl sobbed once, a broken 
cry so unlike the iron will she had 
shown that Craike started. She lean- 
ed perilously over the drop, staring 
down at the horsemen. 

Then her hands moved with des- 
perate speed. She tore hairs from 
her head, twisted and snarled them 
between her fingers, breathed on 
them, looped them with a stone for 
weight, casting the tangled mass 
out to land before the riders. 

The mist curled, took on sub- 
stance. Where there had been only 
rock there was now a thicket of 
thorn, so knotted that no fleshed 
creature could push through it. The 
hunters paused, then they rode on 
again, but now they drove a reeling, 
naked man, a man kept going by 
a lashing whip whenever he fal- 
tered. 

Again the girl sobbed, burying 
her face in her hands. The wretch- 
ed captive reached the thorn bar- 
rier. Under his touch it melted. He 
stood there, weaving drunkenly. 

19 




A whip sang. He went to his 
knees under its cut, a trapped ani- 
mal’s wail on the wind. Slowly, 
with a blind seeking, his hands 
went out to small stones about him. 
He gathered them, spread them 
anew in patterns. The girl had 
raised her head, watched dry-eyed, 
but seething with hate and the 
need to strike back. But she did not 
move. 

Craike dared lay a hand on her 
narrow shoulder, feeling through 
her hair the chill of her skin, while 
the hair itself clung to his fingers 
as if it had the will to smother and 
imprison. He tried to pull her away, 
but he could not move her. 

The naked man crouched in the 
midst of his pattern, and now he 
chanted, a compelling call the girl 
could not understand. She wrench- 
ed free of Craike’s hold. But as 
she went she spared a thought for 
the man who had tried to save her. 
She struck out, her fist landing on 
the stone bruise. Pain sent him 
reeling back as she went over the 
rim of the mesa, her face a mask 
which no friend nor enemy might 
read. But there was no resignation 
in her eyes as she was forced to 
the meeting below. 

IV 

B y the time Craike reached a 
vantage point the girl stood in 
the center of the stone ring. Out- 
side crouched the man, his head on 
his knees. She looked down at him, 
no emotion showing on her wan 
face. Then she dropped her hand 
on his thatch of wild hair. He jerk- 
20 



ed under that touch as he had un- 
der the whip which had printed the 
scailet weals across his back and 
loins. But he raised his head, and 
from his throat came a beast’s 
mournful howl. At her gesture he 
was quiet, edging closer to her as 
if seeking some easement of his 
suffering. 

The Black Hood drew in. Craike’s 
probe could make nothing of them. 
But they could not hide their emo- 
tions as well as they concealed their 
thoughts. And the Esper recoiled 
from the avid blood lust which lap- 
ped at the two by the cliff. 

A semicircle of the black jer- 
kined retainers moved too. And the 
man who had led them lay on the 
earth how, moaning softly. But the 
girl faced them, head unbowed. 
Craike wanted to aid her. Had he 
time to climb down the cliff? 
Clenching his teeth against the pain 
movement brought to his shoulder, 
the Esper went back, holding a 
mind shield as a frail protection. 

Directly before him now was 
one of the guards. His mount 
caught Craike’s scent, stirred un- 
easily, until the quieting thought of 
the Esper held it steady. Craike had 
never been forced into such action 
as he had these past few days; he 
had no real plan now, it must de- 
pend upon chance and fortune. 

As if the force of her enemies’ 
wills had slammed her back against 
the rock, the girl was braced by 
the cliff wall, a black and white 
figure. 

Mist swirled, took on half sub- 
stance of a monstrous form, was 
swept away in an instant. A clump 

IF 




of dried grass broke into flame, 
sending the ponies stamping and 
snorting. It was gone, leaving a black 
smudge on the earth. Illusions, re- 
alities — Craike watched. This was 
so far beyond his own experience 
that he could hardly comprehend 
the lightning moves of mind against 
mind. But he sensed these others 
could beat down the girl’s resis- 
tance at any moment they desired, 
that her last futile struggles were 
being relished by those who decreed 
this as part of her punishment. 

And Craike, who had believed 
that he could never hate more than 
he had when he had been touched 
by the fawning “hound” of the 
mob, was filled with a rage tem- 
pered into a chill of steel deter- 
mination. 

T he girl went to her knees, still 
clutching her hair about her, 
facing her tormenters with her 
still-held defiance. Now the man 
who had wrought the magic which 
had drawn her there crawled, all 
humanity gone out of him, wrig- 
gling on his belly back to his cap- 
tors. 

Two of the guards jerked him 
up. He hung limp in their hands, 
his mouth open in an idiot’s grin. 
Callously, as he might tread upon 
a worm, the nearest Black Hood 
waved a hand. A metal axe flashed, 
and there came the dull sound of 
cracking bone. The guards pitched 
the body from them so that the 
bloodied head almost touched the 
girl. 

She writhed, a last frenzied at- 
tempt to break the force which pin- 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



ned her. Without haste the guards 
advanced. One caught at her hair, 
pulling it tautly from her head. 

Craike shivered. The thrill of her 
agony reached him. This was what 
she feared most, fought so long to 
prevent. If ever he must move now. 
And that part of his brain which 
had been feverishly seeking a plan 
went into action. 

Ponies pawed, reared, went wild 
with panic. One of the Black Hoods 
swung around to face the terrorized 
animals. But his own mount struck 
out with teeth and hooves. Guards- 
men shouted, and above their cries 
arose the shrill squeals of the ani- 
mals. 

Craike stood his ground, keeping 
the ponies in terror-stricken revolt. 
The guard who held the handful of 
hair slashed at the tress with his 
knife, severing it at a palm’s dis- 
tance away from her head. But in 
that same moment she moved. The 
knife leaped free from the man’s 
grasp, while the severed hair twined 
itself about his hands, binding them 
until the blade buried itself in his 
throat; and he went down. 

One of the Black Hoods was also 
finished, tramped into a feebly 
squirming thing by the ponies. 
Then from the ground burst a sheet 
of flame which split into balls, 
drifting through the air or rolling 
along the earth. 

The Esper wet his lips — that 
was not his doing! He did not have 
to feed the panic of the animals 
now; they were truly mad. The girl 
was on her feet. Before his thought 
could reach her she was gone, 
swallowed up in a mist which arose 

21 




to blanket the fire balls. Once more 
she cut their contact; there was a 
blank void where she had been. 

Now the fog thickened. Through 
it came one of the ponies, foam 
dripping from its blunt muzzle. It 
bore down on Craike, eyes gjeam- 
ing red through a tangled forelock. 
With a scream it reared. 

Craike’s hand grabbed a hand- 
ful of mane as he leaped, avoiding 
teeth and hooves. Then, somehow, 
he gained the pad saddle, locking 
his fingers in the coarse hair, striv- 
ing to hold his seat against the 
bucking enraged beast. It broke in- 
to a run, and the Esper plastered 
himself to the heaving body. For 
the moment he made no attempt at 
mind control. 

Behind, the Black Hoods came 
out of their stunned bewilderment. 
They were questing feverishly, and 
he had to concentrate on holding 
his shield against them. A pony flee- 
ing in terror would not excite them; 
a pony under control would provide 
them with a target. 

Later he could circle about and 
try to pick up the trail of the witch 
girl. Flushed with success, Craike 
was sure he could provide her with 
a rear guard no Black Hood could 
pass. 

The fog was thick, and the pace 
ef the pony began to slacken. Once 
or twice it bucked half-heartedly, 
giving up when it could not dislodge 
its rider. Craike drew his fingers in 
slow, soothing sweeps down the 
sweating curve of its neck. 

There were no more trees about, 
and the unshod hooves pounded on 
sand. They were in a dried water 
22 



course, and Craike did not try to 
turn from that path. Then his luck 
ran out. 

What he had ignorantly supposed 
to be a rock ahead, heaved up sev- 
en feet or more. A red mouth open- 
ed in a great roar. He had believed 
the bear he had seen fleeing the fire 
to be a giant, but this one was a 
nightmare monster. 

The pony screamed with an al- 
most human note of despair and 
whirled. Craike gripped the mane 
again and tried to mind control the 
bear. But his surprise had lasted 
seconds too long. A vast clawed paw 
struck, ripping across pony hide 
and human thigh. Then Craike 
could only cling to the running 
mount. 

How long he was able to keep 
his seat he never knew. Then he 
slipped; there was a throb of pain 
as he struck the ground, to be fol- 
lowed by blackness. 

I t was dusk when he opened his 
eyes, fighting agony in his head, 
his leg. But later there was moon- 
light. And that silver-white spot- 
lighted a waiting shape. Green slits 
of eyes regarded him remotely. 
Dizzily he made contact. 

A wolf — hungry — yet with a 
wariness which recognized in the 
prone man an enemy. Craike 
fought for control. The wolf 
whined, then it arose, its prick ears 
sharp cut in the moonlight, it’s nose 
questing for the scent of other, less 
disturbing prey, and it was gone. 

Craike edged up against a boul- 
der and sorted out sounds. The rush 
of water. He moved a paper dry 

IF 




tongue over cracked lips. Water to 
drink — to wash his wounds — 
water! 

With a groan Oraike worked his 
way to his feet, holding fast to the 
top of the rock when his torn leg 
threatened to buckle under him. 
The same inner drive which had 
kept him going through the desert 
brought him down to the river. 

By sunrise he was seeking a shel- 
ter, wanting to lie up, as might the 
wolf, in some secret cave until his 
wounds healed. All chance of find- 
ing the witch girl was lost. But as 
he crawled along the shingle, 
leaning on a staff he had found in 
drift wood, he kept alert for any 
trace of the Black Hoods. 

It was midmorning on the second 
day that his snail’s progress brought 
him to the river towers. And it took 
another hour for him to reach the 
terrace. Gaunt and worn, his empty 
stomach complaining, he wanted 
nothing more than to sink down in 
the nest of grass he had gathered 
and cease to struggle. 

Perhaps he might have done so 
had not a click-clack of sound from 
the river put him on the defensive, 
his staff now a club. But these were 
not Black Hoods. Farmers, local 
men bound for the market of Sam- 
pur with products of their fields. 
They had paused, were making a 
choice among the least appetizing of 
their wares for a tribute to be of- 
fered to the tower demon. 

Craike hitched stiffly to a point 
where he could witness that sacri- 
fice. But when he assessed the 
contents of their dugout, the heap- 
ing basket piled between the pad- 
>VIZARD'S WORLD 



dlers, his hunger took command. 

Fob off a demon with a hand- 
ful of meal and a too-ripe melon 
would they? \Vith three haunches of 
cured meat and all that other stuff 
on board! 

Craike voiced a roar which could 
have done credit to the red bear, a 
roar which altered into a demand 
for meat. The paddlers nearly lost 
control of their crude craft. But 
one reached for a haunch and threw 
it blindly on the refuse covered 
rock, while his companion added a 
basket of small cakes into the bar- 
gain. 

“Enough, little men — ” Craike’s 
voice boomed hollowly. “You may 
pass free.” 

They needed no urging, they did 
not look at those threatening tow- 
ers as their paddles bit into the wa- 
ter, adding impetus to the pull of 
the current. 

Craike watched them well out of 
sight before he made a slow de- 
scent to the rock. The effort he was 
forced to expend warned him that 
a second such trip might be impos- 
sible, and he inched back to the 
terrace dragging both meat and 
cakes. 

The cured haunch he worried in- 
to strips, using his pocket knife. It 
was tough, not too pleasant to the 
taste and unsalted. But he found it 
more appetizing than the cakes of 
baked meal. With this supply he 
could afford to lie up and favor 
his leg. 

About the claw rents the flesh 
was red and puffed. Craike had no 
dressing but river water and the 
leaves he had tied over the tears. 

23 




Samjpur was beyond his power to 
reach, and to contact men travel- 
ing on the river would only bring 
the Black Hoods. 

He lay in his grass nest and tried 
to sort out the events of the past 
few days. This was a land in which 
Esper powers were allowed free 
range. He had no idea of how he 
had come here, but it seemed to his 
feverish mind that he had been 
granted another chance — one in 
which the scales of justice were 
more balanced in his favor. If he 
could only find the girl, learn from 
her — 

Tentatively, without real hope, he 
sent out a questing thought. Noth- 
ing. He moved impatiently, wrench- 
ing his leg, so that his head swam 
with pain. Throat and mouth were 
dry. The lap of water sounded in 
his ears. Water — he was thirsty 
again. But he could not crawl down 
slope and up once more. Craike 
closed his eyes wearily. 

V 

C raike’s memory of the hours 
which followed thereafter was 
dim. HAD he seen a. demon in the 
doorway? A slavering wolf? A red 
bear? 

Then the girl sat there, cross- 
legged as he had seen her on the 
mesa, her cloak of hair about her. 
A hand emerged from the cloak to 
lay wood on the fire. Illusions? 

But would an illusion turn to 
him, put firm, cool fingers upon his 
wound, somehow driving out by 
touch the pain and fire which burn- 
ed there? Would an illusion raise 
24 



his head, cradling it against her so 
that the soft silk of her hair lay 
against his cheek and throat, urging 
on him liquid out of a crude bowl? 
Would an illusion sing softly to 
herself while she drew a fish-bone 
comb back and forth through her 
hair, until the song and the sweep 
of the comb lulled him into a sleep 
so deep that no dream walked 
there? 

He awoke, clear headed. Yet that 
last illusion lingered. For she came 
from the sun-drenched world with- 
out, a bowl of fruit in her hand. 
For a long moment she stood gaz- 
ing at him searchingly. But when he 
tried mind contact, he met that 
wall. Not unheeding — but a re- 
fusal to answer. 

Her hair was now braided. But 
about her face the lock which the 
guardsman had shorn made an un- 
tidy fringe. While around her thin 
body was a strip of hide, purpose- 
fully arranged to mask all feminin- 
ity. 

“So,” Craike spoke rustily, “you 
are real — ” 

She did not smile. “I am real. 
You no longer dream with fever.” 

“Who are you?” He asked the 
first of his long hoarded questions. 

“I am Takya.” She added nothing 
to that. 

“You are Takya, and your are 
a witch — ” 

“I am Takya, and I have the 
power.” It was an assertion of fact 
rather than agreement. 

She settled in her favorite cross- 
legged position, selected a fruit 
from her bowl and examined it 
with the interest of a housewife 

IF 




who has shopped for supplies on a 
limited budget. Then she placed it 
in his hand before she chose an- 
other for herself. He bit into the 
plumlike globe. If she would only 
drop her barrier, let him communi- 
cate in the way which was fuller 
and deeper than speech. 

“You also have the power — ” 

Craike decided to be no more 
communicative than she. He re- 
plied to that with a curt nod. 

“Yet you have not been horn- 
ed — ” 

“Not as you have been. But in 
my own world, yes.”” 

“Your world?” Her eyes held 
some of the feral glow of a hunt- 
ing cat’s. “What world, and why 
were you homed there, man of 
sand and ash, power?” 

Without knowing why Craike re- 
lated the events of the days past. 
Takya listened, he was certain, 
with more than ears alone. She 
picked up a stick from the pile of 
firewood and drew patterns in the 
sand and ash, patterns which had 
something to do with her listening. 

“Your power was great enough 
to break a world wall.” She snap- 
ped the stick between two fingers, 
threw it into the flames. 

“A world wall?” 

“We of the power have long 
known that different worlds lie to- 
gether in such a fashion.” She held 
up her hand with the fingers tight 
lying one to another. ” Sometimes 
there comes a moment when two 
touch so closely that the power can 
carry one through. If at that mo- 
ment there is a desperate need for 
escape. But those places of meeting 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



can not be readily found, and the 
moment of their touch can lay only 
for an instant. Have you in your 
world no reports of men and wom- 
en who have vanished almost in 
sight of their fellows?” 

emembering old tales he nod- 
ded. 

“I have seen a summoning from 
another world,” she continued with 
a shiver, running both hands down 
the length of her braids as if so 
she evoked a shield for both mind 
and body. “To summon so is a 
great evil, for no man can hold in 
check the power of some^iing alien. 
You broke the will of the Black 
Hoods when I was a beast running 
from their hunt. When I made the 
serpent to warn you off, you 
changed it into a fox. And when 
the Black Hoods would have shorn 
my power — ” she looped the 
braids about her wrists, caressing, 
treasuring them against her small 
breasts, “again you broke their hold 
and set me free for a second time. 
But this you could not have done 
had you been born into this world, 
for our power must follow set laws. 
Yours lies outside out patterns and 
can cut across those laws — even 
as the knife cut this — ” She touch- 
ed the rough patch of hair at her 
temple. 

“Follow patterns? Then it was 
those patterns in stone which drew 
you down from the mesa?” 

“Yes. Takyi, my womb-brother, 
whom they slew there, was blood 
of my blood, bone of my bone. 
When they crushed him, then they 
could use him to draw me, and I 

25 





could not resist. But in tihe slaying 
of his husk they freed me — to 
their great torment, as Tousuth 
shall discover in time.” 

“Tell me of this country. Who 
are the Black Hoods and why did 
they horn you? Are you not of 
their breed since you have the 
power?” 

But Tayka did not answer at 
once in words. Nor did she, as he 
had hoped, lower her mind barrier. 

Her fingers now held one long 
hair she had pulled from her head, 
and this she began to weave in and 
out, swiftly intricately, in a com- 
plicated series of loops and crossed 
strands. After a moment Craike 
did not see the white fingers, nor 
the black hair they passed in loops 
from one to another. Rather did 
he see the pictures she wrought in 
her weaving. 

A wide land, largely wilderness. 
The impressions he had gathered 
from Kaluf and the traders crysta- 
lized into vivid life. Small holdings 
here and there, ruled by petty lords, 
new settlements carved out by a 
scattered people moving up from 
the south in great wheeled wains, 
bringing flocks and herds, their 
carefully treasured seed. Stopping 
here and there for a season to sow 
and reap, until they decided upon a 
site for their final rooting. Tiny 
city-states, protected by the Black 
Hoods — the Esper born who pur- 
posefully interbred their own gift- 
ed stock, keeping their children 
apart. 

Takya and her brother coming, 
as was sometimes — if rarely — 
true, from the common people. 
26 



Carefully watched by the Black 
Hoods. Then discovered to be a 
new mutation, condemned as such 
to ibe used for experimentation. But 
for a while protected by the local 
lord who wanted Takya. 

But he might not take her unwill- 
ing. For the power that was hers 
as a virgin was wholly rift from 
her should she be forced. And he 
had wanted that power, obedient to 
him, as a check upon the monop- 
oly of the Black Hoods. So with 
some patience he had set himself 
to a peaceful wooing. But the Black 
Hoods had moved first. 

Had they accomplished her tak- 
ing, the end they had intended for 
her was not as easy as death. And 
she wove a picture of it, with all 
its degradation and shame stark 
and open, for Craike’s seeing. 

“Then the Hooded ones are 
evil?” 

“Not wholly.” She untwisted the 
hair and put it with care into the 
fire. “They do much good, and with- 
out them people would suffer. But 
I, Takya, am different. And after 
me, when I mate, there will be 
others also different. How differ- 
ent we are not yet sure. The 
Hooded Ones want no change, by 
their thinking that means disaster. 
So they would use me to their own 
purposes. Only I, Tayka, shall not 
be so used!” 

“No, you shall not.” The vehe- 
mence of his own outburst startled 
him. Craike wanted nothing so 
much at that moment than to come 
to grips with the Black Hoods, who 
had planned this systematic hunt. 

“What will you do now?” He 

IF 




asked more calmly, wishing she 
would share her thoughts with him, 
“This is a strong place. Did you 
cleanse it?” 

He nodded impatiently. 

“So I thought. That was also a 
task one born to this world might 
not have performed. But those who 
pass are not yet aware of the 
Cleansing. They will not trouble us, 
but pay tribute.” 

C raike found her complacency ir- 
ritating. To lie up here and 
live on the offerings of river trav- 
elers did not appeal to him. 

“This stone piling is older work 
than Sampur and much better,” 
she continued. “It must have been 
a fortress for some of those forgot- 
ten ones who held lands and then 
vanished long. before we came from 
the south. If it is repaired no lord 
of this district would have so good 
a roof.” 

“Two of us to rebuild it?” he 
laughed. 

“Two of us — working thus.” 

A block of stone, the size of a 
brick, which had fallen from the 
sill of one of the needle-narrow 
windows, arose slowly in the air, 
settled into the space from which 
it had tumbled. Illusion or reality? 
Craike got to his feet and lurched 
to the window. His hand fell upon 
the stone which moved easily in his 
grasp. He took it out, weighed it, 
and then gently returned it to its 
place. Not illusion. 

“But illusion too — if need be.” 
There was, for the first time, a 
warm not of amusement in her tone. 
“Look on your tower, river lord!” 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



He limped to the door. Outside 
it was warm, sunny, but it was 
a site of ruins. Then the picture 
changed. Brown drifts of grass van- 
ished from the terrace, the fallen 
stone was all in place. A hard- 
faced sentry stood wary-eyed on a 
repaired river arch. Another guards- 
man led out ponies saddle-padded 
and ready, other men were about 
garrison tasks. 

Craike grinned. The sentry on the 
arch lost his helm, his jerkin. He 
now wore the tight tunic of the Se- 
curity. Police, his spear was a gas 
rifle. The ponies misted, and in their 
place a speedster sat on the stone. 
He heard her laugh. 

'"Your guard, your traveling ma- 
chine. But how grim, ugly. This is 
better!” 

Guards, machine, all were swept 
away. Craike caught his breath at 
the sight of delicate winged crea- 
tures dancing in the air, displaying 
a joy of life he had never known. 
Fawns, little people of the wild, 
came to mingle with such shapes 
of beauty and desire that at last he 
turned his head away. 

“Illusion,” her voice was hard, 
mocking. 

But Craike could not believe that 
what he had seen had been bom 
from hardness and mockery. 

“All illusions. We shall be better 
now with warriors. As for plans, 
can you suggest any better than to 
remain here and take what fortune 
sends — for a space?” 

“Those winged dancers — where?” 

“Illusions!” She returned harsh- 
ly. “But such games tire one. I do 
not think we shall conjure up any

the end of the span above the river, of strangers beyond the upper bend. 
From here the twin tower on the But, Craike tensed, there were no 
other bank looked the same as the peasants bound for the market at 






Sampur. Fear, pain, anger, such 
emotions heralded their coming. 
There were three, and one was hurt. 
But they were not Esper, nor did 
they serve the Black Hoods. Though 
they were, or had been, fighting 
men. 

A brutal journey over the moun- 
tains where they had lost com- 
rades, the finding of this river, the 
theft of the dugout they now used 
so expertly — it was all there for 
him to read. And beneath that some- 
thing else, which, when he found 
it, gave Craike a quick decision in 
their favor — a deep hatred of the 
Black Hoods! Outlaws, very close 
to despair, keeping on a hopeless 
trail because it was not in them to 
surrender. 

Craike contacted them subtly. 
They must not think they were 



heading into an Esper trap! Plant 
a little hope, a faint suggestion that 
there was a safe camping place 
ahead, that was all he could do at 
present. But so he drew them on. 

“No!” A ruthless order cut 
across his line of contact, striking 
at the delicate thread with which 
he was playing the strangers in. But 
Craike stood firm. “Yes, yes, and 
yes!” 

He was on guard instantly. 
Takya, mistress of illusion as she 
had proved herself to be, might act. 
But surprisingly she did not. The 
dugout came into view, carried 
more by the current than the efforts 
of its crew. One lay full length in 
the bottom, while the bow paddler 
had slumped forward. But the man 
in the stern was bringing them in. 
And Craike strengthened his invisi- 



ble, unheard invitation to urge him 
on. 

VI 

B ut Takya had not yet begun to 
fight. As the dugout swung in 
toward the offering ledge one of 
the Black Hoods’ guardsmen ap- 
peared there, his drawn sword tak- 
ing fire from the sun. The fugitive 
steersman faltered until the cur- 
rent drew his craft on. Craike 
caught the full force of the stran- 
ger’s despair, all the keener for the 
hope of moments before. The Esper 
irritation against Takya flared into 
anger. 

He made the illusion reel back, 
hands clutching at his breast from 
which protruded the shaft of an ar- 
row. Craike had seen no bows here, 
but it was a weapon to suit this 
world. And this should prove to 
Takya he meant what he had said. 

Tlie steersman was hidden as the 
dugout passed under the arch. 
There was a scrap of beach, the 
same to which Craike had swum on 
his first coming. He urged the man 
to that, beaming good will. 

But the paddler was almost done, 
and neither of his companions 
could aid him. He drove the crude 
craft to the bank, and its bow 
grated on the rough gravel. Then he 
crawled over the bodies of the oth- 
er two and fell rather than jumped 
ashore, turning to pull up the ca- 
noe as best he could. 

Craike started down. But he 
might have known that Takya was 
not so easily defeated. Though they 
maintained an alliance of sorts she 
30 



accepted no order from him. 

A brand was teleported from the 
tower fire, striking spear-^se in 
the dry brush along the slope. 
Craike’s mouth set. He tried no 
more arguments. They had already 
tested power against power, and he 
was willing to so battle again. But 
this was not the time. However the 
fire was no illusion, and he could 
not fight it, crippled as he was. Or 
could he? 

It was not spreading too fast — 
though Takya might spur it by the 
forces at her command. Now — 
there was just the spot! Craike 
steadied himself against a mound of 
fallen masonry and swept out his 
staff, dislodging a boulder and a 
shower of gravel. He had guessed 
right. The stone rolled to crush out 
the brand, and the gravel he con- 
tinued to push after it smothered 
the creeping flames. 

Red tongues dashed spitefully 
high in a sheet of flame, and Craike 
laughed. THAT was illusion. She 
was angry. He produced a giant 
pail in the air, tilted it forward, 
splashed its contents into the heart 
of that conflagration. He felt the 
lash of her rage, standing under it 
unmoved. So might she bring her 
own breed to heel, but she would 
learn he was not of that ilk. 

“Holla!” That call was no illu- 
sion, it begged help. 

Craike picked a careful path 
down slope until he saw the dugout 
and the man who had landed it. 
The Esper waved an invitation and 
at his summons the fugitive covered 
the distance between them. 

He was a big man of the same 

IF 




brawny race as those of Sampur, 
his braids of reddish hair hanging 
well below his wide shoulders. 
There was the raw line of a half- 
healed wound down the angle of 
his jaw, and his sunken eyes were 
very tired. For a moment he stood 
down-slope from Craike, his hands 
on his hips, his head back, measur- 
ing the Esper with the shrewdness 
of a canny officer who had long 
known how to judge and handle 
raw levies. 

“I am Jorik of the Eagles’ Tow- 
er.” The statement was made with 
the same confidence as the an- 
nouncement of rank might have 
come from one of the petty lords. 
“Though,” he shrugged, “the Ea- 
gles’ Tower stands no more with 
one stone upon the other. You have 
a stout lair here — ” he hesitated 
before he concluded, “friend.” 

“I am Craike,” the Esper an- 
answered as simply, “and I am also 
one who has run from enemies. 
This lair is an old one, though still 
useful.” 

“Might the enemies from whom 
you run wear black hoods?” coun- 
tered Jorik. “It seems to me that 
things I have just seen here have 
the stink of that about them.” 

“You are right. I am no friend 
to the Black Hoods.” 

“But you have the power — ” 

“I have power,” Craike tried to 
make the distinction clear. “You 
are welcome, Jorik. So all are wel- 
come here who are no friends to 
Black Hoods.” 

The big warrior shrugged. “We 
can no longer run. If the time has 
come to make a last stand, this is 
WIZARD^S WORLD 



as good a place as any. My men 
are done.” He glanced back at the 
two in the dugout. “They are good 
men, but we were pressed when 
they caught us in the upper pass. 
Once there were twenty hands of 
us,” he held up his fist and spread 
^he fingers wide for counting. “They 
drew us out of the tower with their 
sorcerers’ tricks, and then put us to 
the hunt.” 

“Why did they wish to make an 
end to you?” 

Jorik laughed shortly. “They dis- 
like those who will not fit into 
their neat patterns. We are free 
mountain men, and no Black Hood 
helped us win the Eagles’ Tower; 
none aided us to hunt. When we 
took our furs down to the valley 
they wanted to levy tribute. But 
what spell of theirs trapped the 
beasts in our dead-falls, or brought 
them to our spears? We pay not 
for what we have not bought. 
Neither would we have made war 
on them. Only, when we spoke out 
and said it so, there were others 
who were encouraged to do like- 
wise, and the Black Hoods must put 
an end to us before their rule was 
broken. So they did.” 

“But they did not get all of you,” 
Craike pointed out. “Can you bring 
your men up to the tower? I have 
been hurt and can not walk with- 
out support or I would lend you a 
hand.” 

“We will come.” Jorik returned 
to the dugout. Water was splashed 
vigorously into the face of the man 
in the bow, arousing him to crawl 
ashore. Then the leader of the fugi- 
tives swung the third man out of 

31 




the craft and over his shoulder in 
a practiced carry. 

W hen Craike had seen the un- 
conscious man established on 
his own grass bed, he stirred up 
the fire and set out food. While 
Jorik returned to the dugout to 
bring in their gear. 

Neither of the other men were of 
the same size as their leader. The 
one who lay limp, his breath flut- 
tering between his slack lips, was 
young hardly out of boyhood, his 
thin frame showing bones rather 
than muscled flesh under the rags 
of clothing. The other was short, 
dark skinned, akin by race to Ka- 
luf’s men, his jaw sprouting a curly 
beard. He measured Craike with 
suspicious glances from beneath 
lowered red lids, turning that study 
to the walls about him and the un- 
known reaches at the head of the 
stair. 

Craike did not try mind touch. 
These men were rightly suspicious 
of Esper arts. But he did attempt to 
reach Takya, only to meet that 
nothingness with which she cloaked 
her actions. Craike was disturbed. 
Surely now that she was convinced 
he was determined to give the har- 
borage to the fugitives, she would 
oppose him. They had nothing to 
fear from Jorik and his men, but 
rather would gain by joining forces. 

Until his wounds were entirely 
healed he could not go far. And 
without weapons they would have 
to rely solely upon Ester powers 
for defense. Having witnessed the 
efficiency of the Hooded Ones’ at- 
tack, Craike doubted a victory in 
32 



any engagement to which those 
masters came fully prepared. He 
had managed to upset their spells 
merely because they had not known 
of his existence. But the next time 
he would have no such advantage. 

On the other hand the tower 
could be defended by force of 
arms. With bows — Craike savored 
the idea of archers giving a Hooded 
force a devastating surprise. The 
traders had had no such arm, as 
sophisticated as they were. And he 
had seen none among the warriors 
of Sampur. He’d have to ask Jorik 
if such were known. 

In the meantime he sat among 
his guests, watching Jorik feed the 
semiconscious boy with soft fruit 
pulp and the other man wolf down 
dried meat. When the latter had 
done, he hitched himself closer to 
the fire and jerked a thumb at his 
chest. 

“Zackuth,” he identified himself. 

“From Larud?” Craike named 
the only city of Kaluf’s people he 
could remember. 

The dark man’s momentary sur- 
prise had no element of suspicion. 
“What do you know of the Children 
of Noe, stranger?” 

“I journeyed the plains with one 
called Kaluf, a Master Trader of 
Larud.” 

“A fat man who laughs much 
and wears a falcon plume in his 
cap?” 

’’Not so,” Craike allowed a 
measure of chill to ice his reply. 
“The Kaluf who led this caravan 
was a lean man who knew the edge 
of a good blade from its hilt. As 
for cap ornaments — he had a red 

IF 




stone to the fore of his. Also he 
swore by the Eyes of the Lady 
Lor.” 

Z ackuth gave a great bray of 
laughter. “"Vou are no stream 
fish to be easily hooked, are you, 
tower dweller? I am not of Larud, 
but I know Kaluf, and those who 
travel in his company do not wear 
one badge one day and another the 
next. But, by the looks of you, you 
have fared little better than we 
lately. Has Kaluf also fallen upon 
evil luck?” 

“I traveled safely with his cara- 
van to the gates of Sampur. How it 
fared with him thereafter I can not 
tell you.” 

Jorik grinned and settled his pa- 
tient back on the bed. “I believe 
you must have parted company in 
haste. Lord ELa-rak?” 

Craike answered that with the 
truth. “There were two who were 
homed. I followed them to give 
what aid I could.” 

Jorik scowled, and Zackmth spat 
into the fire. 

“We were not horned; we have 
no power,” the latter remarked. 
“But they have other tricks to play. 
So you came here?” 

“I was clawed by a bear,” Craike 
supplied a meager portion of his 
adventures, “and came here to lie 
up until I can heal me of that hurt.” 
“This is a snug hole,” Jorik was 
appreciative. “But how got you 
such eating?” He popped half a 
fruit into his mouth and licked his 
juicy fingers. “This is no wilder- 
ness feeding.” 

“The tower is thought to be de- 



mon haunted. Those taking pas- 
sage down stream leave tribute.” 

Zackuth slapped his knee. “The 
Gods of the Waves are good to you, 
Lord Ka-rak, that you should 
stumble into such fortune. There is 
more than one kind of demon for 
the haunting towers. How say you. 
Lord Jorik?” 

“That we have also come into 
luck at last, since Lord Ka-rak has 
made us free of this hold. But per- 
haps you have some other thought 
in your head?” He spoke to the Es- 
per. 

Craike shrugged. “What the 
clouds decree shall fall as rain or 
snow,” he quoted a saying of the 
caravan men. 

I t was close to sunset, and he was 
worried about Takya. He could 
not believe that she had gone per- 
manently. And yet, if she returned, 
what would happen? He had been 
careful not to use Esper powers. 
Takya would have no such com- 
punctions. 

He could not analyze his feelings 
about her. She disturbed him, awoke 
emotions he refused to face. There 
was a certain way she had of look- 
ing sidewise — But her calm as- 
sumption of superiority pricked be- 
neath his surface armor. And the 
antagonism fretted against the feel- 
ing which had drawn him after her 
from the gates of Sampur. Once 
again he sent out a quest-thought 
and, to his surprise, was answered. 
“They must go!” 

“They are outlaws, even as we. 
One is ill, the others worn with 
long running. But they stood against 



WJZARD'S WORLD 



33 




the Black Hoods. As such they have 
a claim on roof, fire and food from 
us.” 

‘‘They are not as we!” again ar- 
rogance. “Send them or I shall 
drive them. I have the power — ” 

“Perhaps you have the power, 
but so do I!” He put all the assur- 
ance he could muster into that. “I 
tell you, no better thing could hap- 
pen then for us to give these men 
aid. They are proven fighters — ” 

“Swords can not stand against 
the power!” 

Craike smiled. His plans were be- 
ginning to move even as he carried 
on this voiceless argument. ”Not 
swords, no, Takya. But all fighting 
is not done with swords nor spears. 
Nor with the power either. Can a 
Black Hood think death to his ene- 
my when he himself is dead, killed 
from a distance, and not by mind 
power his fellows could trace and 
be armored against. 

He had caught her attention. She 
was acute enough to know that he 
was not playing with words, that 
he knew of what he spoke. Quick- 
ly he .built upon that spark of in- 
terest. “Remember how your illu- 
sion guard died upon the offering 
rock when you would warn off 
these men?” 

“By a small spear.” She was con- 
temptuous again. 

“Not so.” He shaped a picture of 
an arrow and then of an archer re- 
leasing it from the bow cord, of its 
speeding true across the river to 
strike deep into the throat of an un- 
suspecting Black Hood. 

“You have the secret of this 
weapon?” 

34 



“I do. And five such arms are 
better than two, is that not the 
truth?” 

She yielded a fraction. “I will re- 
turn. But they will not like that.” 

“If you return, they will welcome 
you. These are no hunters of witch 
maidens — ” he began, only to be 
disconcerted by her obvious amuse- 
ment. Somehow he had lost his 
short advantage over her. Yet she 
did not break contact. 

“Ka-rak, you are very foolish. 
No, these will not try to mate with 
me, not even if I willed it so. As 
you will see. Does the eagle mate 
with the hunting cat? But they will 
be slow to trust me, I think. How- 
ever, your plan has possibilities, 
and we shall see.” 

VII 

T akya had been right about her 
reception by the fugitives. They 
knew her for what she was, and 
only Craike’s acceptance of her 
kept them in the tower. That and 
the fact, which Jorik did not try 
to disguise, that they could not 
hope to go much farther on their 
own. But their fears were partly 
allayed when she took over the 
nursing of the sick youngster, using 
on him the same healing power she 
had produced for Craike’s wound. 
By the new day she was feeding him 
broth and demanding service from 
the others as if they had been her 
liegemen from birth. 

The sun was well up when Jorik 
came in whistling from a dip in 
the river. 

“This is a stout stronghold, 

IF 




Lord Ka-rak. And with the power 
aiding us to hold it, we are not 
likely to be shaken out in a hurry. 
Doubly is that true if the Lady 
aids us.” 

Takya laughed. She sat in the 
shaft of light from one of the nar- 
row windows, combing her hair. 
Now she looked over her shoulder 
at them with something approach- 
ing a pert archness. In that mo- 
ment she was more akin to the 
women Craike had known in his 
own world. 

“Let us first see how the Lord 
Ka-rak proposes to defend us.” 
There was mockery in that, enough 
to sting, as well as a demand that 
he make good his promise of the 
night before. 

But Craike was prepared. He dis- 
carded his staff for a hold on Jo- 
rik’s shoulder, while Zackuth slog- 
ged behind. They climbed into the 
forest. Craike had never fashioned 
a bow, and he did not doubt that 
his first attempts might be failures. 
But, as the three made their slow 
progress, he explained what they 
must look for and the kind of 
weapon he wanted to produce. They 
returned within the hour with an 
assortment of wood lengths with 
which to experiment. 

After noon Zackuth grew rest- 
less and went off, to come back 
with a deer, visibly proud of his 
hunting skill. Craike saw bow- 
strings where the others saw meat 
and hide for the refashioning of 
foot wear. For the rest of the day 
they worked with a will. It was 
Takya, who had the skill necessary 
for the feathering of the arrows 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



after Zackuth netted two black riv- 
er birds. 

Four days later the tower com- 
munity had taken on the aspect of 
a real stronghold. Many of the fall- 
en stones were back in the walls. 
The two upper rooms of the tower 
had been explored, and a vast col- 
lection of ancient nests had been 
swept out. Takya chose the topmost 
one for her own abode and, aided 
by her convalescing charge, the boy 
Nickus, had carried armloads of 
sweet scented grass up for both car- 
peting and bedding. She did not ap- 
pear to be inconvenienced by the 
bats that still entered at dawn to 
chitter out again at dusk. And she 
crooned a welcome to the snowy 
owl that refused to be dislodged 
from a favorite roost in the very 
darkest corner of the roof. 

River travel had ceased. There 
were no new offerings on the rock. 
But Jorik and Zackuth hunted. And 
Craike tended the smoking fires 
which cured the extra meat against 
coming need, while he worked on 
the bows. Shortly they had three 
finished and practiced along the 
terrace, using blunt arrows. 

J orik had a true marksman’s eye 
and took to the new weapon 
quickly, as did Nickus. Blut Zackuth 
was more clumsy, and Craike’s 
stiff leg bothered him. Takya was 
easily the best shot when she would 
consent to try. But while agreeing 
it was an excellent weapon, she pre- 
ferred her own type of warfare and 
would sit on the wall, braiding and 
rebraiding her hair with flying fin- 
gers, to watch their shooting at 

35 




marks and applaud or jeer lightly 
at the results. 

Howev6r, their respite was short. 
Craike had the first warning of 
trouble. He awoke from a dream 
in which he had been back in the 
desert panting ahead of the mob. 
Awoke, only to discover that some 
malign influence filled the tower. 
There was a compulsion on him to 
get out, to flee into the forest. 

He tested the silences about 
him tentatively. The oppression 
which had been in the ancient fort 
at his first coming had not return- 
ed, that was not it. But what? 

Someone moved restlessly in 
the dark. 

“Lord Ka-rak?” Nickus’ voice 
was low and hoarse, as if he strug- 
gled to keep it under contral. 

“What is it?” 

“There is trouble — ” 

A bulk which could only belong 
to Jorik heaved up black against 
the faint light of the doorway. 

“The hunt is up,” he observed. 
“They move to shake us out of here 
like rats out of a nest.” 

“They did this before with you?” 
asked the Esper. 

Jorik snorted. “Yes. It is their 
favorite move to battle. They would 
give us such a horror of our tower 
that we will burst forth and scatter. 
Then they can cut us down as they 
wish.” 

But Craike could not isolate any 
thought beam carrying that night 
terror. It seeped from the walls 
about them. He sent probes unsuc- 
cessfully. There was the pad of feet 
en the stairs, and then he heard 
Takya call: 

36 



“Build up the fire, foolish ones. 
They may discover that they do not 
deal with those who know nothing 
of them.” 

Flame blossomed from the coals 
to light a circle of sober faces. 
Zackuth caressed the spear l)dng 
across his knees, but Nickus and 
Jorik had eyes only for the witch 
maid as she knelt by the fire, lay- 
ing out some bundles of dried leaf 
and fern. Her thoughts reached 
Craike. 

“We must move or these unde- 
fended ones will be drawn out from 
here as nut meats are picked free 
from the shell. Give me of your 
power — in this matter I must be 
the leader.” 

/^hough he resented anew her 
calm assumption of authority, 
Craike also recognized in it truth. 
But he shrank from the task she 
demanded of him. To have no con- 
trol over his own Esper arts, to al- 
low her to use them to feed hers — 
it was a violation of a kind, the 
very thing he had so feared in his 
own world that he had been willing 
to kill himself to escape it. Yet now 
she asked it of him as one who had 
the right! 

“Forced surrender is truly evil — 
but given freely in our defense this 
is different.” Her thoughts swiftly 
answered his wave of repulsion. 

The command to flee the tower 
was growing stronger. Nickus got to 
his feet as if dragged up. Suddenly 
Zackuth made for the door, only 
to have Jorik reach forth a long 
arm to trip him. 

“You see,” Takya urged, “they 

IF 




are already half under the spell. 
Soon we shall not be able to hold 
them, either by mind or body. And 
then they shall be wholly lost — 
for ranked against us now is the 
high power of the Black Hoods.” 
Craike watched the scuffle on the 
floor and then, still reluctant and 
inwardly shrinking, he limped 
around the fire to her side, lying 
down at her gesture. She threw on 
the fire two of her bundles of fern, 
and a thick, sweet smoke curled out 
to engulf them. Nickus coughed, 
put his hands uncertainly to his 
head and slumped, curling up as a 
tired child in deep slumber. And 
the struggle between Jorik and his 
man subsided as the fumes reached 
them. 

Takya’s hand was cool as it slip- 
ped beneath Craike’s jerkin, resting 
over his heart. She was crooning 
some queer chant, and, though he 
fought to hold mind contact, there 
was a veil between them as tangible 
to his inner senses as the fern 
smoke was to his outer ones. For 
one wild second or two he seemed 
to see the tower room through her 
eyes instead of his own, and then 
the room was gone. He sped bodi- 
less across the night world, casting 
forth as a hound on the trail. 

All that had been solid in his nor- 
mal sight was now without meaning. 
But he was able to see the dark 
cloud of pressure closing in on the 
tower and trace that back to its 
source, racing along the slender 
thread of its spinners. 

There was another fire, and about 
it four of the Black Hoods. Here, 
too, was scented smoke to free 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



minds from bodies. The essence 
which was Craike prowled about 
that fire, counting guardsmen who 
lay in slumber. 

With an effort of will which 
drew heavily upon his strength, he 
concentrated on the staff which lay 
before the leader of the company. 
Setting upon it his own commands. 

It flipped up into the air, even 
as its master roused and clutched 
at it, falling into the fire. There was 
a flash of blue light, a sound which 
Craike felt rather than heard. The 
Hooded Ones were on their feet as 
their master stared straight across 
the flames to Craike’s disembodied 
self. His was not an evil face, rath- 
er did it hold elements of nobility. 
But the eyes were pitiless, and 
Craike knew that now it was not 
only war to the death between them, 
but war beyond death itself. The 
Esper sensed that this was the first 
time that other had known of his 
existence, had been able to consider 
him as a factor in the tangled game. 

There was a flash of lightning 
knowledge of each other, and then 
Craike was again in the dark. He 
heard once more Takya’s crooning, 
was conscious of her touch resting 
above the slow, pulsating beat of 
his heart. 

“That was well done,” her 
thought welcomed him. “Now they 
must meet us face to face in bat- 
tle.” 

“They will come.” He accepted 
the dire promise that Black Hood 
had made. 

“They will come, but now we 
are more equal. And there is not 
the Rod of Power to fear.” 

37 




G raike tried to sit up and discov- 
ered that the weakness born 
of his wounds was nothing to that 
which now held him. 

Takya laughed with some of her 
old mockery. Do you think you can 
make the Long Journey and then 
romp about as a fawn, Ka-rak? 
Not three days on the field of bat- 
tle can equal this. Sleep now and 
gather again the inner power. The 
end of this venture is still far from 
us.” 

He could no longer see her face, 
the glimmer of her hair veiled it, 
and then that shimmer reached his 
mind and shook him away from 
consciousness; and he slept. 

It might have been early morning 
when he had made that strange 
visit to the camp of the Black 
Hoods. By the measure of the sun 
across the floor it was late after- 
noon when he lifted heavy eyelids 
again. Takya gazed down upon him. 
Her summons had brought him 
back, just as her urging had sent 
him to sleep. He sat up with a 
smile, but she did not return it. 
“All is right?” 

“We have time to make ready 
before we are put to the test. Your 
mountain captain is not new to this 
game. Matters of open warfare he 
understands well, and he and his 
men have prepared a rude welcome 
for those who come. And,” her 
faint smile deepened. “I, too, have 
done my poor best. Come and see.” 
He limped out on the terrace and 
for a moment was startled. Illu- 
sion, yes, but some of it was real. 

Jorik laughed at the expression on 
Craike’s face, inviting the Esper 
38 



with a wave of the hand to inspect 
the force he captained. For there 
were bowmen in plenty, standing 
sentinel on the upper walls, arch, 
and tower, walking beats on the 
twin buildings across the river. And 
it took Craike a few seconds to 
sort out the ones he knew from 
those who served Takya’s purposes. 
But the real had been as well post- 
ed as their illusionary companions. 
Nickus, for his superior accuracy 
with the new weapon, held a van- 
tage point on the wall, and Zackuth 
was on the river arch where his ar- 
rows needed only a short range to 
be effective. 

“Look below,” Jorik urged, 
“and see what shall trip them up 
until we can pin them.” 

A gain Craike blinked. The illu- 
sion was one he had seen be- 
fore, but that had been a hurried 
erection on the part of a desperate 
girl, this was better contrived. For 
all the ways leading to the river 
towers were cloaked with a tangled 
mass of thorn trees, the spiked 
branches interlocking into a wall 
no sword, no spear could hope to 
pierce. It might be an illusion, but 
it would require a weighty counter- 
spell on the part of the Hooded 
Ones to clear it. 

“She takes some twigs Nickus 
finds, and a hair, and winds them 
together, then buried all under a 
stone. After she sings over it — and 
we have this!” Jorik babbled. “She 
is worth twenty hands — no, twice 
twenty hands, or fighting men, is 
the Lady Takya! Lord Ka-rak, I 
say that there is a new day coming 

IF 




VIII 



for this land when such as you two 
stand up against the Hooded Ones.” 

“Aaaay — ” the warning was 
soft but clear, half whistle, half call, 
issuing from Nickus* lofty post. 
“They come!” 

“So do they!” That was a sharp 
echo from Zackuth, “and down 
river as well.” 

“For which we have an answer,” 
Jorik was undisturbed. 

Those in the tower held their 
fire. To the confident attackers it 
was as such warfare had always 
been for them. If half their com- 
pany was temporarily halted by the 
spiny maze, the river party had 
only to land on the offering rock 
and fight their way in, their efforts 
reinforced by the arts of their 
Masters. 

But, as their dugout nosed in, 
bow cords sang. There was a voice- 
less scream which tore through 
Craike’s head as the hooded man 
in its bow clutched at the shaft 
protruding from his throat and fell 
forward into the river. Two more 
of the crew followed him, and the 
rest stopped paddling, dismayed. 
The current pulled them on under 
the arch, and Zackuth dropped a 
rock to good purpose. It carried one 
of the guardsmen down with it as 
it hit the craft squarely. The dugout 
turned over, spilling all the rest 
into the water. 

Zackuth laughed; Jorik roared. 

“Now they learn what manner 
of blood letting lies before them!” 
he cried so that his words must have 
reached the ears of the besiegers. 
“Let us see how eagerly they come 
to such feasting.” 

WIZARD'S WORLD 



I t was plain that the Black Hoods 
held their rulership by more 
practical virtues than just courage. 
Having witnessed the smashing dis- 
aster of the river attack, they made 
no further move. Night was coming, 
and Craike watched them withdraw 
downstream with no elation. Nor 
did Jorik retain his cheerfulness. 

“Now they will try something 
else. And since we did not fall easi- 
ly into their jaws, it will be harder 
to face. I do not like it that we 
must so face it during the hours of 
dark.” 

“There will be no dark,” Takya 
countered. One slim finger pointed 
at a corner of the terrace, and up 
into the gathering dusk leaped a 
pencil of clear light. Slowly she 
turned and brought to life other 
torches on the roof of the tower 
over river, on the arch spanning 
the water, on the parapet — And 
in that radiance nothing could move 
unseen. 

“So!” Her fingers snapped, and 
the beacons vanished. “\^en they 
are needed, we shall have them.” 
Jorik blinked. “Well enough. 
Lady. But honest fire is also good, 
and it provides warmth for a man’s 
heart as well as light for his eyes.” 
She smiled as a mother might 
smile at a child. “Build your fire. 
Captain of Swords. But we shall 
have ample warning when the ene- 
my comes.” She called. A silent 
winged thing floated down and 
alighted on the arm she held out 
to invite it. The white owl, its eyes 
seeming to observe them all with 

39 





intelligence, snapped its wicked 
beak as Takya stared back at it. 
Then with a flap of wings, it went. 

“From us they may hide their 
thoughts and movements. But they 
can not close the sky to those things 
whose natural home it is. Be sure 
we shall know, and speedily, when 
they move against us.” 

They did not leave their posts 
however. And Zackuth readied for 
action by laying up pieces of rub- 
ble which might serve as well as 
his first lucky shot. 

It was a long night, wearing on 
the tempers of all but Takya. Time 
and time again Craike tried to probe 
the dark. But a blank wall was all 
he met. Whatever moves the Black 
Hoods considered, they were pro- 
tected by an able barrier. 

Jorik took to pacing back and 
forth on the terrace, five strides 
one way, six the other, and he 
brought down his bow with a little 
click on the time-worn stones each 
time he turned. 

“They are as busy hatching trou- 
ble as a forest owl is in hatching an 
egg! But what kind of trouble?” 
Craike had schooled himself in- 
to an outward patience. “For the 
learning of what we shall have to 
wait. But why do they delay — ?” 
Why did they? The more on edge 
he and his handful of defenders be- 
came, the easier meat they were. 
And he had no doubt that the 
Black Hoods were fertile in sur- 
prise. Though, judging by what 
Takya and Jorik reported, they were 
not accustomed to such determined 
and resourceful opposition to their 
wills. Such opposition would only 

IF 



40 





firm their desire to wipe out the 
' rebels. 

“They move,” Takya’s witch 
fires leaped from every point she 
had earlier indicated. In that light 
she sped across the terrace to 
stand close to Jorik and Craike, 
close to the parapet wall. “This is 
the lowest hour of the night when 
the blood runs slow and resistance 
is at its depth. So they choose to 
move — ” 

Jorik snapped his bow cord, and 
the thin twang was a harp’s note 
in the silence. But Takya shook her 
head. 

“Only the Hooded On^ come, 
and they are well armored. Seel” 
She jumped to the parapet and 
clapped her hands. 

TTie witch light shown down on 
four standing within the thorn bar- 
rier, staring up from under the 
shadow of their hoods. An arrow 
sang, but it never reached its mark. 
Still feet away from the leader’s 
breast it fell to earth. 

B ut Jorik refused to accept de- 
feat. With all the force of his 
arm he sent a second shaft after the 
first. And it, too, landed at the feet 
of the silent four. Craike grasped at 
Takya, but she eluded him, moving 
to call down to the Hooded Ones: 
“What would you, men of pow- 
er — a truce?” 

“Daughter of evil, you are not 
alone. Let us speak with your lord.” 
She laughed, shaking out her un- 
bound hair, rippling it through 
her fingers, gloatingly. “Does this 
show that I have taken a lord, men 
of power? Takya is herself, without 
WIZARD'S WORLD 




division, still. Let that hope die 
from your hearts. I ask you again, 
what is it you wish — a truce?” 
“Set forth your lord, with him 
we will bargain.” 

She smoothed back her hair im- 
patiently. “I have no lord, I and 
my power are intact. Try me and 
see, Tousuth. Yes, I know you Tou- 
suth, the Master, and Salsbal, Bu- 
lan, Yily — ” she told them off 
with a pointed forefinger, a child 
counting, out in some game. 

Jorik stirred and drew in a sharp 
breath, and the men below shifted 
position. Craike caught thoughts — 
to use a man’s name in the presence 
of hostile powers, that was magic 
indeed. 

“Takya!” It was a reptile’s hiss. 
Again she laughed. “Ah, but the 
first naming was mine, Tousuth. Did 
you believe me so poor and power 
lost that I would obey you tamely? 
I did not at the horning, why should 
I now when I stand free of you? 
Before you had to use Takyi to 
capture me. But Takyi is gone in- 
to the far darkness, and over me 
now you can lay no such net! Also 
I have summoned one beside me — ” 
Her hand closed on Craike’s arm, 
drawing him forward. 

He faced the impact of those 
eyes meeting them squarely. Rais- 
ing his hand he told them off as 
the girl had done: 

“Tousuth, Master of women bait- 
ers, Salsbal, Bulan, Yily, the wolves 
who slink behind him. I am here, 
w ' at would you have of me?” 
Hut they were silent, and he 
CO lid feel them searching him out, 
n^iiking thrusts against his mind

shield, learning in their turn that 
he was of their kind; he was Esper 
bom. 

“What. would you have?” he re- 
peated more loudly. “If you do not 
wish to treat — then leave the night 
undisturbed for honest men’s 
sleep.” 

“Changling!” It was Tousuth 
who spat that. It was his turn to 
point a finger and chant a sentence 
or two, his men watching him with 
confidence. 

But Craike, remembering that 
other scene before Sampur, was 
trying a wild experiment of his 
own. He concentrated upon the 
man Takya had named Yily. Black 
cloak, black hood making a vul- 
ture’s shadow against the rock. 
Vulture — vulture! 

He did not know that he had 
pointed to his chosen victim, nor 
that he was repeating that word 
aloud in the same intonation as 
Tousuth’s chant. “Vulture!” 

Cool hand closed about his other 
wrist, and from that contact pow- 
er flowed to join his. It was point- 
ed, launched — 

4 tT culture!” 

V A black bird flapped and 
screamed, arose on beating wings to 
fly at him, raw red head outstretched, 
beak agap. There was the twang of 
a bow cord. A scream of agony 
and despair and a black cloaked 
man writhed out his life on the 
slope by the thorn thicket. 

“Good!” Takya cried. “That was 
well done, Ka-rak, very well done! 
But you can not use that weapon 
a second time.” 



IF 




C raike was filled with a wild ela- 
tion, and he did not listen to 
her. His finger already indicated 
Bulan and he was chanting: 
“Dog—” 

But to no purpose. The Black 
Hood did not drop to all fours, he 
remained human; and Craike’s voice 
faded. Takya spoke in swift whis- 
per: 

“They are warned, you can nev- 
er march against them twice by the 
same path. Only because they were 
unprepared did you succeed. Ho, 
Tousuth,” she called, “do you now 
believe that we are well armed? 
Speak with a true tongue and say 
what you want of us.” 

“Yes,” Jorik boomed, “you can 
not take us. Master of power. Go 
your way, and we shall go ours — ” 
“There can not be two powers 
in any land, as you should know, 
Jorik of the Eagles’ towers, who 
tried once before to prove that and 
suffered thereby. There must be a 
victor here — and to the vanquished 
— naught!” 

Craike could see the logic in 
that. But the Master was continu- 
ing: As to what we want here — it 
is a decision. Match your power 
against ours, changling. And since 
you have not taken the witch, use 
her also if you wish. In the end it 
will come to the same thing, for 
both of you must be rendered help- 
less.” 

“Here and now?” asked Craike. 
“Dawn comes, it will soon be 
another day. By sun or shadow, we 
care not in such a battle.” 

The elation of his quick success 
in that first try was gone. Craike 
WIZARD'S WORLD 



fingered the bow he had not yet 
used. He shrank inwardly from the 
contest the other proposed, he was 
too uncertain of his powers. One 
victory had come from too little 
knowledge. Takya’s hand curled 
about his stiff fingers once again. 
The impish mockery was back in 
her voice, ruffling his temper, irri- 
tating him into defiance. 

“Show them what you can do, 
Lord Ka-rak, you who can master 
illusions.” 

He glanced down at her, and the 
sight of that cropped lock of hair 
at her temple gave him an odd con- 
fidence. Neither was Takya as all- 
powerful as she would have him 
believe. 

“I accept your challenge,” he call- 
ed. “Let it be here and now.” 

“WE accept your challenge!” 
Takya’s flash of annoyance, her 
quick correction, pleased him. Be- 
fore the echo of her words died 
away she hurled her first attack. 

Witch fire leaped down slope to 
ring in the three men, playing brief- 
ly along the body of the dead Yily. 
It flickered up and down about 
their feet and legs so they stood 
washed in palid flame. While about 
their heads darted winged shapes 
which might have been owls or 
other night hunters. 

There was a malignant hissing, 
and the slope sprouted reptiles, 
moving in a wave. Illusions? All — 
or some. But designed, Craike un- 
derstood, to divert the enemy’s 
minds. He added a few of his own 
— a wolfish shape crouching in the 
shadow — leaping — to vanish as 
its paws cut the witch fire. 

43 




Swift as had been Takya’s attack, 
so did those below parry. An op- 
pressive weight, so tangible that 
Craike looked up to see if some 
mountain threatened them from 
overhead, began to close down up- 
on the parapet. He heard a cry of 
alarm. There WAS a black cloud 
to be seen now, a giant press closing 
upon them. 

Balls of witch fire flashed out of 
the light pillars, darted at those on 
the parapet. One flew straight at 
Craike’s face, its burning breath 
singeing his skin. 

“Fool!” Takya’s thought was a 
whip lash, “Illusions are only real 
for the believer.” 

H e steadied, and the witch ball 
vanished. But he was badly 
shaken. This was outside any Esper 
training he had had, it was the 
very thing he had been conditioned 
against. He felt slow, clumsy, and 
he was ashamed that upon Takya 
must the burden of their defense 
now rest. 

Upon her — Craike’s eyes nar- 
row^. He loosened her hold on 
him did not try to contact her. 
There was too much chance of self- 
betrayal in that. His plan was ut- 
terly wild, but it had been well 
demonstrated that the Black Hoods 
could only be caught by the unex- 
pected. 

Another witch ball hurtled at 
him, and he leaped to the terrace, 
landing with a force which sent a 
lance of pain up his healing leg. 
But on the parapet a Craike still 
stood, shoulder to shoulder with 
Takya. To maintain that illusion 
44 



was a task which made him sweat 
as he crept silently away from the 
tower. 

He had made a security guard 
to astonish Takya, the wolf, all the 
other illusions. But they had been 
only wisps, things alive for the mo- 
ment with no need for elaboration. 
To hold this semblance of himself 
was in some ways easier, some ways 
harder. It was easier to make, for 
the image was produced of self- 
knowledge, and it was harder, for 
it was meant to deceive masters of 
illusion. 

Craike reached the steps to the 
rock of the offerings. The glow of 
the witch lights here was pale, and 
the ledge below dark. He crept 
down, one arrow held firmly in his 
hand. 

Here the sense of oppression was 
a hundredfold worse, and he moved 
as one wading through a flood 
which entrapped limbs and brain. 
Blind, he went to all fours, feeling 
his way to the river. 

He set the arrow between his 
teeth in a bite which indented its 
shaft. A knife would have been far 
better, but he had no time to beg 
Jorik’s. He slipped over, shivering 
as the chill water took him. Then 
he swam under the arch. 

It was comparatively easy to 
reach the shingle where the dugout 
of the Black Hoods had turned 
over. As he made his way to the 
shore he brushed against water- 
soaked cloth and realized he shared 
this scrap of -gravel with the dead. 
Then, arrow still between his teeth, 
Craike climbed up behind the Black 
Hoods’ position. 



IF 




IX 

T he thorn hedge cloaked the rise 
above him. But he concentrated 
on the breaking of that illusion, 
wading on through a mass of thorns, 
intact to his eyes, thin air at his 
passing. Then he was behind the 
Black Hoods. Takya stood, a black 
and white figure on the wall above, 
beside the illusion Craike. 

Nowl 

The illusion Craike swelled a lit- 
tle more than life size, while his 
creator gathered his feet under him, 
preparatory to attack. Tlie Craike 
on the wall altered — anything to 
hold the attention of Tousuth for 
a crucial second or two. Monster 
grew from man, wings, horns, 
curved tusks, all embellishments 
Craike’s imagination could add. He 
heard sihouts from the tower. 

But with the arrow as a dagger 
in his hand, he sprang, allowing 
himself in that moment to see only, 
to think only of a point on Tou- 
suth’s back. 

The head drove in and in, and 
Tousuth went down on his knees, 
clutching at his chest, coughing. 
While Craike, with a savagery he 
had not known he possessed, lean- 
ed on the shaft to drive it deeper. 

Fingers hooked about Craike’s 
throat, cutting off air, dragging 
him back. He was pulled from Tou- 
suth, loosing his hold on the ar- 
row shaft to tear at the hands deny- 
ing him breath. There was a r^ 
fog which even the witch lights 
could not pierce and the roaring in 
his head was far louder than the 
shouts from the tower. 



Then he was flat on the ground, 
still moving feebly. But the hands 
were gone from his throat, and he 
gasged in air. Around him circled 
balls of fire, dripping, twirling, he 
closed his eyes against their glare. 

“Lord — Lord!” 

The hail reached him only faint- 
ly. Hands pulled at him, and he 
tried to resist. But when he opened 
his eyes it was to see Jorik’s brown 
face. Jorik was at the tower — how 
had Craike returned there? Surely 
he HAD attacked Tousuth? Or was 
it all illusion? 

“He is not dead.” 

Whether or not that was said to 
him, Craike did not know. But his 
fingers were at his throat and he 
winced from his own touch. Then 
an arm came under his shoulders, 
lifting him, and he had a dizzy 
moment until earth and gray sky 
settled into their proper places. 

Takya was there, with Nickus 
and Zackuth hovering in the back- 
ground of black jerkined guards- 
men who stared back at her sullen- 
ly over the bodies of the dead. For 
they were all dead — the Hooded 
Ones. There was Tousuth, his head 
in the sand. And his fellows crum- 
pled beside him. 

The witch girl chanted, and in her 
hands was a cat’s cradle of black 
strands. The men who followed 
Tousuth cringed, and their fear was 
a cloud Craike could see. He grab- 
bed at Jorik, won to his feet, and 
tried to hail Takya. But not even a 
croak came from his tortured throat. 
So he flung himself at her, one 
hand out like a sword blade to 
slash. It fell across that wicked net 

45 



WIZARD^S WORLD 




of hair, breaking it, and went to 
close upon Takya’s wrist in a crush- 
ing grip. 

“Enough!” He could get out that 
command mind to mind. 

She drew in upon herself as a 
eat crouches for a spring, and spat, 
her eyes green with feral lusting 
fire. But he had an answer to that, 
read it in her own spark of fear at 
his touch. His hands twined in her 
hair. 

‘They are men,” he pulled those 
black strands to emphasize his 
words,” they only obeyed orders. 
We have a quarrel with their mas- 
ters, but not with them!” 

“They himted, and now they shall 
be hunted!” 

“I have been hunted, as have 
you, witch woman. And while I 
live there shall be no more such 
hunts — whether I am hound or 
quarry.” 

“While you live — ” her men- 
ace was ready. 

S uddenly Craike forced out a 
hoarse croak meant for laugh- 
ter. “You, yourself, Takya, have 
put the arrow to this bow cord!” 
He kept one hand tangled in her 
hair. But with the other he snatch- 
ed from her belt the knife she had 
borrowed from Nickus and not re- 
turned. She screamed, beat against 
him with her fists, tried to bite. He 
mastered her roughly, not loosing 
his grip on that black silk. And 
then in sweeps of that well whet- 
ted blade he did what the Black 
Hoods had failed in doing, he sawed 
through those lengths. 

“I am leaving you no weapons, 



Takya. You shall not rule here 
as you have thought to do — ” The 
exultation he had known when he 
had won his first victory against 
the Black Hoods was returning a 
hundredfold. “For a while I shall 
pull those pretty claws of yours!” 
He wondered briefly how long it 
would take her hair to regrow. At 
least they would have a breathing 
spell before her powers returned. 

Then, his arm still prisoning her 
shoulders, the mass of her hair 
streaming free from his left hand, 
he turned to face the guardsmen. 

‘Tell them to go,” he thought, 
“taking their dead with them.” 
“You will go, taking these with 
you,” she repeated aloud, stony 
calm. 

One of the men dropped to his 
knees by Tousuth’s body, then 
abased himself before Craike. 

“We are your hounds. Master.” 
Craike found his voice at last. 
“You are no man’s hounds — for 
you are a man. Get you gone to 
Sampur and tell them that the pow- 
er is no longer to make hind nor 
hound. If there are those who wish 
to share the fate of Tousuth, per- 
haps when they look upon him as 
dead they will think more of it.” 
“Lord, do you come also to 
Sampur to rule?” the other asked 
timidly. 

Craike laughed. “Not until I 
have established my lordship else- 
where. Get you back to Sampur 
and trouble us no more.” 

He turned his back on the guards- 
men and, drawing the silent Takya, 
still within the circle of his arm, 
with him, started back to the tow- 

IF 



46 




er. The bowmen remained behind, 
and Craike and the girl were alone 
as they reached the upper level. 
He paused then and looked down 
into her set, expressionless face. 
“What shall I do with you?” 
You have shamed me and tak- 
en my power from me. What does 
a warrior do with a female slave?” 
She formed a stark mind picture, 
hurling it at him as she had hurled 
the stone on the mesa. 

With his left hand he whipped 
her hair across her face, smarting 
under that taunt. 

“I have taken no slave, nor any 
woman in that fashion, nor shall I. 
Go your way, Takya, and fight me 
again if you wish when your hair 
has grown.” 

S he studied him, and her astonish- 
ment was plain. Then she laughed 
and clutched at the hair, tearing it 
free from his grasp, bundling it in- 
to the front of her single garment. 

“So be it, Ka-rak. It is war be- 
tween us. But I am not departing 
hence yet a while.” She broke away, 
and he could hear the scuff of her 
feet on the steps as she climbed to 
her own chamber in the tower. 

“They are on their way, Lord, 
and they will keep to it.” Jorik 
came up. He stretched. “It was a 
battle not altogether to my liking. 
For the honest giving of blows from 
one’s hand is better than all this 
magic, potent as it is.” 

Craike sat down beside the fire. 
He could not "have agreed more 
heartily with any suggestion. Now 
that it was over he felt drained of 
energy. 

WIZARD'S WORLD 



“I do not believe they will re- 
turn,” he wheezed hoarsely, very 
conscious of his bruised throat. 

Nickus chuckled, and 2^ckuth 
barked his own laughter. 

“Seeing how you handled the 
Lady, Lord, they want nothing 
more than to be out of your grasp 
and that as speedily as possible. 
Nor, when those of Sampur see 
what they bring with them, do I 
think we shall be sought out by 
others bearing drawn swords. Now,” 
Jorik slapped his fat middle, “I 
could do with meat in my belly. 
And you. Lord, have taken such 
handling as needs good food to 
counter.” 

There was no mention of Takya, 
nor did any go to summon her 
when the meat was roasted. And 
Craike was content to have it so. 
He was too tired for any more 
heroics. 

Nickus hummed a soft tune as 
he rubbed down his unstrung bow 
before wrapping it away from the 
river damp. And Craike was aware 
that the younger man glanced at 
him slyly when he thought the Es- 
per’s attention elsewhere. Jorik, too, 
appeared highly amused at some 
private thoughts, and he had fallen 
to beating time with one finger to 
Nickus’ tune. Craike shifted un- 
comfortably. He was an actor who 
had forgotten his lines, a novice re- 
quired to make a ritual move he did 
not understand. What they wanted 
of him he could not guess, for he 
was too tired to mind toudi. He 
only wanted sleep, and that he 
sought as soon as he painfully swal- 
lowed his last bite. But he heard 

47 




through semistupor a surprised ex- 
clamation from Nickus. 

“He goes not to seek her — to 
take her!” 

J orik’s answer held something of 
approval in it. “To master such 
as the Lady Takya he will need full 
strength of power and limb. His is 
the wisest way, not to gulp the 
fruits of battle before the dust of 
the last charge is laid. She is his 
by shearing, but she is no meek 
ewe to come readily under any 
man’s hand.” 

Takya did not appear the next 
day, nor the next. And Craike made 
no move to climb to her. His com- 
panions elaborately did not notice 
her absence as they worked togeth- 
er, setting in place fallen stones, 
bringing the tower into a better 
state of repair, or killing deer to 
smoke the meat. For as Jorki 
pointed out: 

“Soon comes the season of cold. 
We must build us a snug place and 
have food under our hands before 
then.” He broke off and gazed 
thoughtfully down stream. “This 
is also the fair time when country- 
men bring their wares to market. 
There are traders in Sampur. We 
could offer our hides, even though 
they be newly fleshed, for salt and 
grain. And a bow — this Kaluf of 
whom you have spoken, would he 
not give a good price for a bow?” 
Craike raised an eyebrow. “Sam- 
pur? But they have little cause to 
welcome us in Sampur.” 

“You and the Lady Takya, Lord, 
they might take arms against in 
fear. But if Zackuth and I went in 



the guise of wandering hunters — 
and Zackuth is of the Children of 
Noe, he could trade privately with 
his kin. We must have supplies. 
Lord, before the coming of the 
cold, and this is too fine a fortress 
to abandon.” 

So it was decided that Jorik and 
Zackuth were to try their luck with 
the traders. Nickus went to hunt, 
wrecking havoc among the flocks 
of migrating fowl, and Craike held 
the tower alone. 

A s he turned from seeing them 
away, he sighted the owl wheel 
out from the window slit of the up- 
per chamber, its mournful cry 
sounding loud. On sudden impulse 
he went inside to climb the stair. 
There had been enough of her sulk- 
ing. He sent that thought before 
him as an order. She did not reply. 
Craike’s heart beat faster. Was — 
had she gone? The rough outer wall, 
was it possible to climb down that? 

He flung himself up the last few 
steps and burst into the room. She 
was standing there, her shorn head 
higji as if she and not he had been 
the victor. When he saw her Craike 
‘Stopped. Then he moved again, 
faster than he had climbed those 
stairs. For in that moment the cus- 
toms of this world were clear, he 
knew what he must do, what he 
wanted to do. If this revelation was 
some spell of Takya’s he did not 
care. 

Later he was aroused by the ca- 
ress of silk on his body, felt her 
cool fingers as he had felt them 
drawing the poison from his 
wounds. It was a black belt, and she 

IF 



48 




was making fast about him, mur- 
muring words softly as she inter- 
wove strand with strand about his 
waist until there was no beginning 
nor end to be detected. 

“My chain on you, man of pow- 
er.” Her eyes slanted down at him. 

He buried both his hands in the 
ragged crop of hair from which 
those threads had been severed and 
so held her quiet for his kiss. 

“My seal upon you, witch.” 

“What Tousuth would have done, 
you have accomplished for 'him,” 
she observed pensively when he 
had given her a measure of freedom 
once again. “Only through you may 
I now use my power.” 

“Which is perhaps well for this 
land and those who dwell in it,” he 
laughed. “We are now tied to a 
common destiny, my lady of river 
towers.” 

She sat up running her hands 
through her hair with some of her 
old caress. 

“It will grow again,” he con- 
soled. 



“To no purpose, except to pleas- 
ure my vanity. Yes, we are tied to- 
gether. But you do not regret it, 
Ka-r-ak — ” 

“Neither do you, witch.” There 
was no longer any barrier between 
their minds, as there was none be- 
tween their bodies. “What destiny 
will you now spin for the two of 
us?” 

“A great one. Tousuth knew my 
power-to-come. I would now re- 
alize it.” Her chin went up. “And 
you with me, Ka-rak. By this,” 
her hand rested lightly on the belt. 

“Doubtless you will set us up as 
rulers over Sampur?” he said lazily, 
lazily. 

“Sampur!” she sniffed. ‘This 
world is wide — ” Her arms went 
out as if to encircle all which lay 
beyond the tower walls. 

Ctraike drew her back to him 
jealously. “For that there is more 
than time enough. This is an hour 
for something else, even in a war- 
lock’s world.”

IF • Short Story 



BERSERKER'S PREY 

by FRED SABERHAGEN 



The berserker owned them and would 
destroy them when if chose — unless 
they could somehow destroy if firsti 



T lie ship had been a human 
transport once, and it still 
transported humans, hut now they 
rode like well cared for cattle on 
the road to market. Control of 
their passage and destiny had been 
vested in the electronic brain and 
auxiliary devices built into the 
New England after its capture in 
space by a berserker machine. 

GUberto Klee, latest captive to 
be thrust aboard, was more fright- 
ened than he had ever been before 
in his young life, and trying not to 
^ew it. Why the berserker had kept 
him alive at all he did not know. He 
was afraid to think about it. Like 
evetyone else he had heard the 
horror stories — of human brains, 
stMl half^alive, built into berserker 
computers as auxiliary circuits; of 
human bodies used in the berserk- 
ers’ experiments intended to pro- 
duce convincing artificial men; of 



humans kept os test-targets for new 
berserker death-rays, toxins, ways to 
drive men mad. 

After the raid Gil and the hand- 
ful of others who had been taken 
with him — for aU they knew, the 
only survivors of their planet — 
had been separated and kept in sol- 
itary compartments aboard the great 
machine in space. And now the 
same berserker devices that had 
captured him, or other devices like 
them, had taken him from his cell 
and led him to an interior dock 
aboard the planetoid-sized berserk- 
er; and before they put him aboard 
this ship that had been a human 
transport once, he had time to see 
the name New England on her hull. 

Once aboard, he was put into a 
chamber about twenty paces wide 
and perhaps fifty long, twelve or 
fifteen feet high. Evidently all in- 
terior decks and paneling, every- 



50 





thing non-essential, had been rip- 
ped out. There was left the inner 
hull, some plumbing, some light, ar- 
tificial gravity and air at a good 
level. 

There were eight other people in 
the chamber, standing together and 
talking among themselves; they fell 
silent as the machines opened the 
door and thrust Gil in with them. 

44T Tow do,” said one man to 

Jn Gil, as the door closed be- 
hind the machines again. The speak- 
er was a thin guy who wore some 
kind of spaceman’s uniform that 
now bagged loosely on his frame. 
As he spoke he took a cautious step 
forward and nodded. Everyone was 
watching Gil alertly — just in case 
he should turn out to be violently 
crazy, Gil supposed. Well, it wasn’t 
the first time in his life he’d been 
thrown in with a group of prison- 
ers who looked at him like that. 

“My name is Rom,” the thin 
guy was saying. “Ensign Rom, 
United Planets Space Force.” 

“Gilberto Klee.” 

Everyone relaxed just slightly, 
seeing that he was fairly normal. 

“This is Mr. Hudak,” said Ensign 
Rom, indicating another young, 
once-authoritative man. Then he 
went on to name the others, but 
Gil couldn’t remember all their 
names at once. Three of them were 
women, one of them young enough 
to make Gil look at her with some 
interest. Then he saw how she kept 
half-crouching behind the other 
people, staring smiling at nothing, 
fingers playing omceasingly with her 
long and imkempt hair. 

BERSERKER'S PREY 



Mr. Hudak had started to ask 
Gil questions, bis voice gradually 
taking on the tone used by people- 
in-charge conducting an examina- 
tion. In school. Youth Bureau, po- 
lice station. Resettlement, always 
there was that certain tone of voice 
used by processors when speaking 
to the processed — though Gil had 
never put the thought in just those 
words. 

Hudak was asking him: “Were 
you on another ship, or what?” On 
a ship. You were not a spaceman, 
of course, said the tone of author- 
ity now. You were just a boy being 
processed somewhere, we see that 
by looking at you. Not that the tone 
of authority was intentionally nasty. 
It usually wasn’t. 

“I was on a planet,” said Gil. 
“Bella Coola.” 

“My God, they hit that too?” 

“They sure hit the part where I- 
was, anyway.” Gil hadn’t seen any- 
thing to make him hopeful about 
the rest of the planet. At the Reset- 
tlement Station where he was they 
had had just a few minutes’ warn- 
ing from the military, and then the 
radios had gone silent. There wasn’t 
much the people at the Station 
could do with the little warning 
they had been given. Already they 
could see the berserker heat-rays 
and dust-^maohines playing over the 
woods, which was the only conceal- 
ment they might have to run to. 

Still, some of the kids had been 
trying to run when the silvery, 
poisonous-looking dart that was the 
berserker’s launch had appeared 
descending overhead. The Old Man 
had come tearing out of the com- 

51 




pound into the fields on his scooter 
— maybe to tell his young people 
to run, maybe to tell them to stand 
still. It didn’t seem to make much 
difference. The ones who ran were 
rayed down by the enemy, and the 
ones who didn’t were rounded up. 
What Gil recalled most clearly 
about the other kids dying was the 
look of agony on the Old Man’s 
face — that one face of authority 
that had never seemed to be look- 
ing at Gil from the other side of 
a glass wall. 

When all the survivors of the 
Station had been herded together in 
a bunch, standing in a little crowd 
under the bright sky in the middle 
of a vine-grown field, the machines 
singled out the Old Man. 

Some of the machines thk had 
landed were in the shape of metal 
men, some looked more like giant 
steel ants. “Thus to all life, save 
that which serves the cause of 
Death,” said a twanging metal 
voice. And a steel hand picked a 
squash from a vine and held the 
fruit up and squeezed through it so 
it fell away in broken pulpy halves. 
And then the same hand, with 
squash-pulp still clinging to the 
bright fingers, reached to take the 
Old Man by the wrist. 

The twanging voice said: “You 
are to some degree in control of 
these other life-units. You will now 
order them to co-operate willingly 
with us.” 

The Old Man only shook his 
head, no. Muttered something. 

The bright hand squeezed, slow- 

ly- 

The Old Man squeezed, but did 



not fall. Neither did he give any or- 
der for co-operation. Gil was sitond- 
ing rigid, and silent, but screaming 
in his own mind for the Old Man 
to give in, to fall down and pass 
out, anything to make it stop . 

But the Old Man would not fall, 
or pass out, or give the order that 
was wanted. Not even when the 
berserker’s big hand came up to 
clamp around his skull, and the 
pressure was once more applied, 
slowly as before. 

44'lT^hat was on Bella Coola?” 
V V Ensign Rom was asking 
him. “I mean, military?” 

“Not much, I guess,” said Gil. “I 
^on’t know much about military 
stuff. I was just sort of studying to 
be a farmer.” 

“Oh.” Rom and Hudak, the two 
sharp, capable-looking ones among 
the prisoners, exchanged glances. 
Maybe they knew the farms on 
Bella Coola had been just a sort of 
reform-school setup for tough Idds 
from Barth and other crowded 
places. Gil told himself he didn’t 
give a damn what anyone thought. 

And then he realized that he had 
always been telling himself that 
and that maybe now, for the first 
time in his life, it was the truth. 

In a little while the prisoners 
were fed. A machine brought in a 
big cake of mottled pink and green 
stuff, the same tasteless substance 
Gil had lived on since his capture 
eight or ten days ago. While he ate 
he sat off to one side by himself, 
looking at nothing and listening to 
the two sharp guys talking to each 
other in low voices. 



52 



IF 




Rom was saying: “Look we’re 
in what was the crew quarters, 
right?” 

“If you say so.” 

“Right. Now they brought me in 
through the forward compartment, 
the control room, and I had a 
chance to take a quick look around 
there. And I’ve paced off the length 
of this chamber we’re in. I tell you 
I served aboard one of these ships 
for a year, I know ’em inside out.” 

“So?” 

“Just this.” There was a faint 
scrape and shudder through the hull. 
When Rom spoke again his low 
voice was charged with excitement. 
“Feel that? We’re going spacebome 
again, the big machine’s sending 
this ship somewhere, for some rea- 
son. That means we would have a 
chance, if only . Listen, the cir- 
cuitry that makes up the brain 
that’s controlling this ship and 
keeping us prisoner — it has to 
be spread out along that plastic 
bulkhead at the forward end of this 
compartment we’re in. On the con- 
trol room side there’s another plas- 
tic slab been installed, and the cir- 
cuitry must be sandwiched in be- 
tween the two.” 

“How can you know?” Hudak 
sounded skeptical. 

Rom’s voice dropped even lower, 
giving arguments most of which Gil 
could not hear. “ ... as well pro- 
tected there against outside attack 
as anywhere in the ship . paced 
off the distance . overhead here, 
look at the modifications in the 
power conduits going forward ...” 

Hudak: “You’re right, I guess. 
Or at least it seems probable. That 
BERSERKER^S PREY 



plastic barrier is all that keeps us 
from getting at it, then. I wonder 
how thick.” 

Gil could see from the corner of 
his eye that the two sharp guys were 
trying not to look at what they 
were talking about; but he was free 
to stare. The forward end of the 
big chamber they were in was a 
blank greenish plastic wall, pierced 
along the top for some pipes, and 
at one side by the door through 
which Gil had been brought in. 

“Thick enough, of course. We 
don’t have so much os a screwdriv- 
er, and we’d probably need a cut- 
ting torch or a hydraulic jack — ” 

Hudak nudged Rom and they 
fell silent. The door forward had 
opened, and one of the man-sized 
machines came in. 

“Ghberto Klee,” it twanged. 
“Come.” 

R om had been right; they were 
spacebome again, away from 
the big berserker. In the forward 
compartment Gil had a moment to 
look out before the man-sized ma- 
chine turned him away from a view 
of stars and faced him toward a 
squat console, a thing of eyelike 
lights and a radiolike speaker, which 
seemed to crouch before the front 
of the plastic wall. 

“Gilberto Klee,” said the con- 
sole’s speaker. “It is my purpose to 
keep a number of human life-units 
alive and in good -health.” 

For a while, Gil thought. 

The speaker said: “The stan- 

dard nutrient on which prisoners 
are fed is evidently lacking in one 
or more necessary trace ingredi- 

53 




ents. In several places where pris- 
oners are ibeing held, symptoms of 
nutritional deficiency have devel- 
oped, including general debility, loss 
of sight, loss of teeth.” Pause. “Are 
you aware of my meaning?” 

“Yeah. I just don’t talk much.” 

“You Gilberto Klee, are experi- 
enced at growing lifeforms to be 
consumed by human life-units as 
food. You will begin here in this 
ship to grow food for yourself and 
other human life^nits.” 

There was a pause that stretched 
on. Gil could see the Old Man 
very plainly and hear him scream. 

“Squash would be good,” Gil said 
at last. “I know how to raise it, 
and there’s lots of vitamins and stuff 
in the kind of squash we had at the 
Station. But I’d need seeds, and 
soil ...” 

“A quantity of soil has 'been pro- 
vided,” said the console. And the 
man-sized machine picked up and 
held open a plastic case that was 
divided into many compartments. 
“And seeds,” the console added. 
“Which are the ones for squash?” 

When Gil was returned to the 
prison chaimiber other machines were 
already busy there with the modifi- 
cations he had said would be need- 
ed. They were adding more over- 
head lights and covering most of 
the deck space with wide, deep 
trays. These trays were set on the 
transverse girders of the inner hull, 
revealed by the removal of decking. 
Under the trays drainage pipes were 
being connected, while sprinklers 
went high overhead. Into the trays 
the machines were dumping soil 
they carted in from somewhere. 

54 



Gil gave his fellow prisoners an 
explanation of what was going on. 

“So that’s why it took you and 
some of the other farmers alive,” 
said Hudak. “There must be a lot of 
different places where human pris- 
oners are being held and maybe bred 
for experiments. Lots of healthy 
animals needed.” 

“So,” said Rom, looking sideways 
at Gil. “You’re going to do what it 
wants?” 

“A guy has to keep himself 
alive,” Gil said, “before he can do 
anything else.” 

Rom began in a heated whisper: 
“Is it better that a berserker’s pris- 
oners should ibe kept — ” But he 
broke off when one of the man- 
sized machines paused nearby, as if 
it was watching and listening. 

T ^hey came to call that machine 
the Overseer, because from then 
on it never left the humans, though 
the other machines departed when 
the construction job was done. 
Through the Overseer, the berserk- 
er-Jbrain controlling the ship inform- 
ed Gil that the other prisoners were 
mainly a labor pool, should he 
need human help in food-growing. 
Gil thought it over briefly. “I 
don’t need no help — yet. Just 
leave the people stay here for now, 
but I’ll do the planting.” 

Spacing the hills and dropping 
the seeds was easy enough, though 
the machines had left no aisles be- 
tween the trays of soil except a 
small passage leading to the door. 
The trays farthest forward almost 
touched the plastic bulkhead, and 
others were laid edge to edge back 

IF 




to within a few paces of the rear. 
The machines gave Gil a platform 
the size of a short surfboard, on 
which he could sit or lie while hov- 
ering at a steady two feet above the 
soil. Hudak said the thing must work 
by a kind of hole in the artificial 
gravity field. On the platform was 
a simple control lever by means of 
which Gil could cause it to move 
left or right, forward or back. Al- 
most as soon as the planting was 
done, he had to start tending his 
fast-growing vines. The vines had to 
be twisted to make them grow 
along the soil in the proper direc- 
tion, and then there were extra 
blossoms to be pinched off. A’ cou- 
ple of the other prisoners offered 
to help, despite Rom’s scowling at 
them, but Gil refused the offer. 
You have to have a knack, he said, 
and some training. And he did it all 
himself. 

The two sharp guys had little to 
say to Gil about anything any more. 
But they were plainly interested in 
his surfboard, and one day while 
the Overseer’s back was turned Rom 
took Gil hurriedly aside. Rom whis- 
pered quickly and feverishly, like 
a man taking what he knows is a 
crazy chance, fed up enough to take 
it anyway. “The Overseer doesn’t 
pay much attention to you any more 
when you’re working, Gil. You 
could take that platform of yours 
— ,” Rom’s right hand, extended 
horizontally, rammed the tips of its 
fingers into the palm of his vertical 
left hand — “into the wall. If you 
could only make a little crack in 
the plastic, a hole big enough to 
stick a hand through, we’d have 
BERSERKER'S PREY 



some kind of chance. I’d do it but 
the Overseer won’t let anyone but 
you near the plaform.” 

Gil’s lip curled. “/ ain’t gonna 
try nothin’ like that.” 

The thin sickly man was not used 
to snotty kids talking back to him, 
and he flared feebly into anger. 
“You think the berserker’s going to 
take good care of you?” 

“The machine built the platform, 
didn’t it?” Gil demanded. Wouldn’t 
give us nothing we could bust 
through there with. Not if there’s 
anything so important as you think 
back there.” 

For a moment Gil thought Rom 
was going to swing at him, but 
other people held Rom back. And 
suddenly the Overseer was no longer 
standing on the other side of the 
chamber with its back turned, but 
right in front of Rom, staring at him 
with its lenses. A few long, long 
seconds passed before it was plain 
that the machine was not going to 
do anything this time. But maybe 
its hearing was better than the sharp 
guys had thought. 

4 4 '^T^hey ain’t ripe yet, but we can 
-L eat some of ’em anyway,” 
said Gil a couple of weeks later, as 
he slid off his platform to join the 
other people in the few square 
yards of living space left along the 
chamber’s rear bulkhead. Cradled 
in Gil’s arm were half a dozen dull 
yellowish ovoids. He turned casu- 
ally to the Overseer and asked: 
“Got a knife?” 

There was a pause. Then the 
Overseer extended a hand, from 
vfhich a wicked blade extended it- 

55 




self like an extra finger. “I will di- 
vide the fruit,” it said, and proceed- 
ed to do so with great jfrecision. 

The little group of prisoners had 
come crowding around, some inter- 
est stirring in their dull eyes. They 
ate greedily the little morsels that 
the Overseer doled out; anything 
ta'. OvI good after weeks or months 
of nothing but the changeless pink- 
and-green cake. Rom, after a scarce- 
ly perceptible hesitation, joined the 
others in eating some raw squash. 
He showed no enjoyment as the 
others did. It was just that a man 
had to be healthy, he seemed to be 
thinking, before he could persuade 
others to get themselves killed, or 
let themselves sicken and die. 

Under the optimum conditions 
provided by the berserker at Gil’s 
direction, only weeks rather than 
months were needed for the trays 
to become filled with broad round- 
ish leaves, spreading above a pro- 
fusion of thickening, ground-hug- 
ging vines. Half of the fast-growing 
fruit was hidden under leaves, 
while others burgeoned in the full 
light, and a few hung over the edges 
of the trays, resting their new weight 
on the girders under the trays or 
sagging all the way to the deck. 

Gil maintained that the time for 
a proper harvest was still an indefi- 
nite number of days away. But each 
day he now came back to the living 
area with a single squash to be di- 
vided by the Overseer’s knife; and 
each day the fruit he brought was 
larger. 

He was out in the middle of his 
“fields,” lying prone on his plat- 
form and staring moodily at a 
56 



swelling squash, when the sound 
of a sudden commotion back in the 
living area made him raise himself 
and turn his head. 

The center of the commotion was 
the Overseer. The machine was 
hopping into the air again and 
again, as if the brain that controlled 
it had gone berserker indeed. The 
prisoners cried out, scrambling to 
get away from the Overseer. Then 
the machine stopped its mad jump- 
ing, and stood turning in a slow 
circle, shivering, the knife-finger on 
its hand flicking in and out. 

“Attention, we are entering bat- 
tle,” the Overseer proclaimed sud- 
denly, dead monotone turned up to 
deafening volume. “Under attack. 
All prisoners are to be — they will 
all — ” 

It said more, but at a speed no 
human ear could follow, gibbering 
up the frequency scale to end in 
something like a human scream. 
The mad girl who never spoke let 
out a blending yell of terror. 

The Overseer tottered and sway- 
ed, brandishing its knife. It babbled 
and twitched — like an old man 
with steel fingers vising his head. 
Then it leaned forward, leaned fur- 
ther, and fell on its face, disappear- 
ing from Gil’s sight below the level 
of trays and vines, striking the deck 
with a loud clang. 

That clang was echoed, forward, 
by a cannon-crack of sound. Gil had 
been keeping himself from looking 
in that direction, but now he turned. 
The plastic wall had been split 
across the center third of its extent 
by a horizontal fissure a few feet 
above the trays. 



IF 




Gil lay still on his platfonn, 
watching cautiously. Ensign Rom 
came charging across the trays and 
past him, trampling the crop un- 
heedingly, to hurl himself at the 
wall. Even cracked, it resisted his 
onslaught easily, but he kept pound- 
ing at it with his fists, trying to 
force his fingers into the tiny crev- 
ice. Gil looked back the other way. 
The Overseer was still down. Hu- 
dak was trying the forward door and 
finding it locked. Then first he, and 
then the other people, were scram- 
bling over trays to join Rom and 
help him. 

Gil tested his platform’s control 
and found that it no longer worked, 
though the platform was still aloft. 
He got up from it, setting foot in 
soil for the first time in a couple 
of months; it was a good feeling. 
Then he lifted the thin metal plat- 
form sideways out of its null and 
carried it over to where everyone 
else was already struggling with the 
wall. “Here,” Gil said, “try stick- 
ing the corner of this in the crack 
and pryin’.” 

I t took them several hours of 
steady effort to make a hole 
in the wall big enough for Rom to 
squeeze through. In a minute he 
was back, crying and shouting, an- 
nouncing freedom and victory. 
They were in control of the ship! 

\^en he came back the second 
time, he was in control of himself 
as well, and puzzled. “What crack- 
ed the wall, though? There’s no 
fighting, no other ships around — ” 
He fell silent as he joined Hudak 
in staring down the narrow space 
BERSERKER'S PREY 



between the farthest forward tray 
and the slightly bulged-in section of 
wall where the strain had come to 
force the first crack above. Gil had 
already looked down there into the 
niches between wall and transverse 
girder. Those niches were opened 
up now, displaying their contents — 
the dull yellowish fruit Gil had 
guided into place with a pinch and 
a twist of vine. The fruit had been 
very small then, but now they were 
huge, and cracked gently open with 
the sudden release of their own in- 
ternal pressure. 

Funny pulpy things that a man 
could break with a kick, or a steel 
hand squeeze through like nothing. 

. “But growth is stobborn, boys,” 
the Old Man always said, squinting 
to read a dial, then piling more 
weights onto the machine with the 
growing squash inside it, a machine 
he’d set up to catch kids’ eyes and 
minds. “Can’t take a sudden shock. 
Slow. But now, look. Five thousand 
pounds pressure per square inch. All 
from millions of tiny cells, just 
growing, aU together. Ever see a 
tree root swell under a concrete 
walk?” 

It was on Rom’s and Hudak’s 
faces now that they understood. 
Gil nodded at them once and ' 
smiled just faintly to make sure 
they knew it had been no accident. 
Then the smile faded from his face 
as he looked up at the edges of 
broken plastic, the shattered tracery 
of what had been a million sand- 
wiched printed circuits. 

“I hope it was slow,” Gil said. 
“I hope it felt the whole thing.”

All TRUE BEIIEVERS 

by HOWARD L. MORRIS 

Illustrated by FINLAY 



The baron's job was to prevent 
a revolt — by passing on the 
message that would trigger it! 



I 

T he Chief Porter of Ness House 
tiptoed into the study of the 
man who to him represented omni- 
potence. Omnipotence was in a good 
mood. Sir Hubert Wulf-Leigh, K.K. 
S., Baron Minor, was usually in a 
good mood when he was totaling up 
the monthly reports on the wine 
duty which fell to the Lord Deputy 
Warden of the Ness by delegation 
of royal prerogative. 



Looking up smiling from his ac- 
counts, he asked casually, “Who is 
it this time?” 

“The Senior Captain of the mer- 
chanters, m’Lord. ’E says ’ee sent 
for him.” 

“Hugh Cruffin, eh? That’s right, 
I did send for him. Show him in.” 
There was a few moments’ pause 
and then the dean of merchant cap- 
tains entered. He was a tall, though 
now somewhat stooped, figure of a 
man, whose cap clutched in gnarled 



58 





arthritic fingers revealed an unruly 
and rather sparse head of white 
hair as he followed the porter in. 

Seeing the captain obviously ill 
at ease, the baron began with 
amenities of the more commonplace 
variety. “Some rum, captain? No? 
Then you’ll try some of this wine, 
best Madura, out of a Spiniel prize, 
ni keep you company on this ci- 
gar. The damn doctors have warned 
me to avoid the delights of the 
grape lest my old liver trouble kick 
up anew, and my darling Arabella 
keeps careful tabs on the wine 
flasks.” 

This confession of human frailty 
did much to put Captain Hugh at 
his ease. “You sent for me, ’Lord. 
I hope we can do the business 
quickly. I sail on Milady o' Plymness 
at four bells of the afternoon watch. 
That’s two o’clock, sir.” 

For a moment Sir Hubert frown- 
ed slightly. “I know that. Master 
Cruffin. You know I was Confi- 
dential Clerk to the Board of Lord 
High Admirals and was sort of a 
seaman by proxy. Now to the point: 
I remember that when the Freun- 
chies and their sky boats threatened 
the Ness, you told me about false 
lighters and wreckers, didn’t you?” 

“Aye, I told ’yee all right. And 
’ee used it to give ’en a royal roust- 
ing.” The old man chuckled appre- 
ciatively at the recalled memory. 

“Now tell me this after a mo- 
ment of careful thought: Are there 
any more wreckers on this coast?” 

“No, my Lord.” The aged cap- 
tain did not hesitate more than a 
few seconds. “There be none. The 
Navy and the Coast Patrol cleaned 



’em out fifteen or twenty years ago, 
and I’ll fight any man that says dif- 
ferent.” 

“I’m afraid the men who made 
the charges aren’t much on fighting,” 
was the placatory response of the 
official ruler of the Ness. “You’ve 
heard of the Compassionate Con- 
fraternity of St. Angus of the Open 
Hands.” 

A puzzled look came over Cruf- 
fin’s face. “The compassionate Con- 
fraternity, who be’en? Oh, ’ee means 
the black ’uns.” A look of feral 
hatred now came over the mer- 
chantman’s face. “He’d know it 
would be’en with sneaking ways 
and ’eir oaths to the Bishop of New 
Byzantium; besides which ’en are 
Pantlerists.” 

The Warden mildly chided him 
for this display of bigotry. “Cap- 
tain Hugh, you shouldn’t talk that 
way. You sound as if the Act of 
Forbearance was never passed.” 

The old man waved a triumphant 
finger in Sir Hubert’s face. “Ajid 
’oo sat in Lindesnes Palace when 
mun was passed? Rupert Pantler, 
the last Pantler, that’s who mun 
was!” 

T Tell, a lot of water has flown 
VV under Lindesnes Bridge since 
then. At any rate, you know that 
the Augus brothers have the re- 
sponsibility for the burial of all Cul- 
lenlanders who die on our shores 
or in our country and, as many of 
them do, die destitute. You also 
know about the wreck on Ex- 
mouth Head the other day?” 

The dean of captains nodded 
gravely. “Aye, I do. But mun was 



ALL TRUE BELIEVERS 



59 




not wreckers. Mun was foolish- 
ments. ’En showed too much can- 
vas, ’en did. Fore and main sails, 
fore and main topsails and main 
t’gallants, ’en was making. And to 
come about Exmouth Head with 
twenty knots o’ wind blowing man 
was not foolishments, mun was sui- 
cide.” 

“Well, foolishness or suicide, they 
were thrown onto Exmouth Head 
four days past and all hands per- 
ished. The next day the sea gave 
up one of her victims — a red- 
headed man, and by -that red head, 
a medal round his neck and th’ cut 
o’ his clothes identified as a Cullen- 
lander. We gave him over to the 
Angus Brothers and the next day 
the Superior of the order called on 
me, said there were indications he 
was carrying papers of importance 
to his family in Cullenland and that 
those papers were no longer on him. 
I convinced him of the innocence 
of the Ness or the Navy and he 
suggested wreckers. I thought of 
you and had you sent for.” 

“As I said, m’Lord, ’ere be no 
more wreckers, but — ” the old 
man’s face brightened — “ ’ere still 
be strand-gleaners. A strand-gleaner 
be not outlawed. He can take any 
goods found on the shore, not on the 
person of a corpse and broken clear 
of the hull of a ship.” 

Sir Hubert made a tent of his 
fingers and looked through them 
at the captain smiling ironically. 
“And what act of Parliament made 
this strand-gleaning lawful?” 

“’Ere be no act of Parliament 
made mun lawful. Mun be the law 
of the sea-folk joined with the 



strand-dwellers and handed down 
father to son for six hundred years. 
Mun is older than Parliament.” 

Sir Hubert shrugged. “I guess that 
is potent law. But in this case, I 
think we can tap stronger sources 
like the King’s prerogative in flotsam 
and jetsam. I shall look further in- 
to this strand-gleaning. Tell me, are 
there many strand-gleaners at Ex- 
mouth Head?” 

“Oh no, m’Lord. ’En be agreed 
be the strand-gleaners that one on 
’en shall have a stretch of coast to 
munself. The strand-gleaner at Ex- 
mouth Head be the taverner Will 
Devers and mun came down from 
his father Jack Devers and his gaf- 
fer Tom Devers an’ back all the 
way in ’eir line. ’En be main proud 
of the honor, m’Lord.” 

“I don’t doubt it,” snapped the 
Lord Deputy. “Picking the bones 
of Briden’s merchant ships! I shall 
call on Mr. Devers. And I pray 
you. Captain, do not send word to 
Master Devers that I am coming. I 
plan to fall on Mr. Devers by acci- 
dent. I’ll arrange that accident soon.” 

The captain chuckled appreci- 
atively. “ ’E be a smooth ’un, ’ee be. 
’Ee plans an accident. Mun be some 
accident.” 

“Yes,” frowned Wilfly, “we plan 
accidents around here. Here are 
two royals for your trouble. Cap- 
tain, and there’ll be two royals 
more for your silence too if the inn- 
keeper is taken by surprise.” 

“Tie me up and throw me in 
the chain locker, should mun get 
out by my fault. Why, bewig me, 
ni have the sailmaker sew up my 
lips with linen thread.”

IF 




“That won’e be necessary, Cap- 
tain. Just go on board the Milady o* 
Plymness and leave the rest to me.” 

A fter the mariner went out the 
Baron Minor sat a few mo- 
ments lost in thought, then snapped 
his fingers and walked from his 
study to the front hall. He called 
up the stairs, “Arabella, my love!” 
“Coming, Wilfly,” came the 
prompt and melodious answer of 
Dame Arabella Pepinart Wulf-Leigh, 
the beautiful daughter of Lord 
High Admiral Alexander Pepinart, 
a slender, sparkling-eyed, curly- 
haired brunette. She had wed the 
Lord Deputy Warden of the Ness 
eighteen months previous, two 
months after the defeat of the 
Freunch descent on the Plymness. 
“What ^id you call me for, my 
dear?” 

“Partly to look at you and see 
how lovely you are,” cooed the 
Knight of the King’s Strand, “and 
that’s most important. Of somewhat 
lesser importance is an invitation. 
How would you like to leave Wilfly 
Junior here with his governess, pack 
a hamper of cold lunch and go out 
for a day on the green and possibly 
spend the night at a country inn?” 
“Corking!” she enthused, then 
frowned. “And what about work? 
Do you have some scheme of in- 
spection or some other job in mind 
while you’re down there enjoying 
life on the green?” 

Sir Hubert grinned, an abashed 
sheepish grin. “My darling, you 
should have been a thief catcher for 
the Royal Assizes. I did intend to 
go down to Exmouth to inspect the 



lighthouse there. I have a responsi- 
bility, you know, and whenever a 
ship is cast up I must go down and 
quiz the lighthouse keeper. I haven’t 
done it yet in the wreck of the 
Leveret a few nights back. So if 
that would spoil it for you — ” He 
trailed off into an embarrassed 
silence. 

“You darling old work-donkey of 
a man! Of course you wouldn’t spoil 
it. We’ll still be together on the 
coach and lunching on the green, 
and at the country inn. You ought 
to be kissed for thinking of this, 
in fact.” She fitted action to the 
suggestion and threw her arms 
about his neck. She planted a 
light but tender smack on his lips, 
then darted away, laughing, before 
he could catch her up. “Not now, 
my love. Later on the green and 
still better later at the inn; now 
I must go and order the steward to 
pack a good lunch and get myself 
into some country clothing. I’ll be 
down in half an hour.” Noting Wulf 
Leigh’s eyebrows raised in amused 
and quizzical challenge, she amend- 
ed hastily: “Well, in an hour at any 
rate.”

I t was a glowingly radiant couple 
that Will Devers, the Taverner of 
Exmouth, welcomed to his court- 
yard under his grimly ominous sigh 
of the “Foundered Ship” that eve- 
ning. Milady’s eyes sparkled. Her 
every gesture was filled with the in- 
nocent enjoyment of the afternoon 
and the promise of earthier pleasures 
in the night to come. The Deputy

Warden was tanned and relaxed. 
Hiere a slight knittmg of bis 
brows as if some unhappy thou^t 
lay in ambush at the back of his 
brain. 

Will Devers was in seventh 
heaven. He bustled around and 
burbled as he bustled. “No, m’Lord, 
Milady, mun be’nt often that quality 
folk like ’ee honor my humble way 
station. Avast, ye lubber!” he bel- 
lowed at a porter. “Don’t handle 
her Ladyship’s portateau so rough- 
ly.” 

“You were Navy?” Sir Hubert in- 
quired, stirred by the turn of the 
host’s speech. 

“Aye, sir. Mun’s right, I was four 
years cook’s mate on the Lyonesse, 
six years cook on the old Indomita- 
ble and two years captain’s steward 
on the Thunderer. Then I came 
back here a trained man and took 
over the inn from my old dad. Mun’s 
been the way we Dever’s have 
readied oursens for three or four 
generations.” 

The Baron Minor chuckled. “I’m 
glad you mentioned that service as 
steward; else I was set to walk out. 
Navy ration cooking isn’t my idea 
of good backround for a taverner.” 

“No, my Lord, mun ben’t,” 
agreed the landlord. He ushered 
them to seats at a large oak table, 
and began to lavish attentions on 
them. “Some wine, m’Lord, Milady? 
I have some good Chambergnon, 
some passable Madura — ” 

“Don’t bother with your list, 
Master Devers, just bring a bottle 
of Rossa.” 

“Darling.” The soft word was 
made all full of sharp and thorny 



edges, and Lady Arabella’s glance 
would have frozen the wine in its 
flagons. Sir Hubert got the mes- 
sage. 

“I’m afraid I forgot. Master 
Taverner,” he explained, “that my 
doctor in Lindesnes forbade me the 
pleasures of the vine. I indulged a 
little too much in those pleasures in 
recent years and my liver survives 
only on sufferance.” 

The landlord stood in silent sym- 
pathy for this sudden revelation of 
human frailty in one of so great a 
station, then shook his head sadly. 
“Ten bells!” the unusual sailor’s 
oath burst from his lips. “To be so 
rich and yet so poor.” Then his 
face brightened. “ ’Er doctor didn’t 
warn ’ee beyond the vine, did he? 
He didn’t warn ’ee to beware the 
fruits of the tree, did he?” 

The Baron Minor fixed him with 
an intense stare. “No, he didn’t. 
Master Devers. What do you have in 
mind?” 

“Well, sir, mun’s perry, made 
of pears, from a tree. So whole- 
some mun be, the doctors here- 
parts give mun to colicky children. 
Shall I bring ’ee some?” 

The Lord Deputy Warden looked 
at his wife who shrugged a grudging 
assent. “Very well, host, you may 
bring us some.” 

T he perry, when it came, was not 
exactly an attractive drink, a 
murky gray color with some slight 
overtones of green and gold. Wulf 
Leigh raised his glass to Lady Ara- 
bella in a brave toast. “Here’s to 
you, my lady, may this drink ex- 
ceed its looks in the quality of its

taste as you, my lady, exceed all 
other ladies in beauty.” With a comi- 
cal grimace, he murmured: “It had 
better I For in its looks, it puts me 
in mind of some of those half 
poisonous potions they fed me when 
I was taking the cure at Inverhock- 
ing.” 

They were very pleasantly sur- 
prised. The perry went down 
smoothly and sweetly, with just 
enough fermentation in the drink to 
add a faintly acrid tang. They en- 
joyed a second glass before the 
roast was on the table and at the 
end of the meal. Sir Hubert ordered 
the landlord to put six bottles with 
their baggage and contracted for 
the weekly delivery of six bottles 
to the steward of Ness House. “And 
if the good King comes to Ness 
House, I shall introduce him to your 
perry. And a pox take me,” en- 
thused the Warden of the Ness, “if 
you don’t get a warrant or patent 
or whatever they call it as the royal 
purveyor of perry to His Majesty 
William the Fifth.” 

“’Is blood!” gasped the innkeep- 
er. Then, suddenly abashed, “Re- 
gretting the profanity to ’er Lady- 
ship, but mun gave such a start; me 
a warranted royal purveyor with the 
right to stamp the royal coat of 
arms on every bottle. Why, I’d have 
to double-size my orchard!” 

“I don’t doubt it,” gruffed the 
eminent semi-naval person. Then 
his face, which had been relaxed a 
few moments before, now suddenly 
straightened into the grim visage 
of a sentencing judge. “If my Lord- 
ship can, I can also take away. I’d 
have a word with you. Master De- 



vers, in your cabinet or study or 
counting room or wherever you 
keep your accounts. Arabella, go 
up to your chambers and indulge 
yourself in the totally unnecessary 
fripperies that you needlessly under- 
go to make yourself beautiful.” 

The former Miss Pepinart gasped 
in pleasure. “Why, Wilfly, that’s 
one of the nicest things you’ve ever 
said to me. Get done with your 
business quickly. I’ll be waiting up.” 
With an arch-conspiratorial smile 
on her face, she flitted nimbly up- 
stairs. 

The taverner led the way into his 
counting room and watched uneasily 
as his lordship shut the door as soon 
as he had lit the candle. 

“If mun’s the Chambergnon that 
ires ’ee ’ere are lawful ways of get- 
ting mun. I can explain . .” 

“Don’t worry about that, host. 
I’m not after smuggled merchandise 
tonight, even though it migjit go 
better with you if you turned up 
at the prize auction at Plymness 
more often than you do now if 
you’re going to sell Freunch wines. 
I aim to make inquiry into another 
and more delicate matter. I refer of 
course to one of the ways in which 
you acquire property.” 

“ ’Ee means, sir?” The innkeeper 
assumed a baffled look. 

Sir Hubert’s words were sharp and 
incisive. “I mean, sir, an infringe- 
ment upon one of the King’s rights, 
the right of the King to possession 
of all valuables cast up or thrown 
overboard from wrecks or ships in 
danger of foundering, the preroga- 
tive of flotsam and jetsam. I charge 
you. Master Devers, with infringe-

63 




ment of that right. I charge you with 
being the strand-gleaner for Ex- 
mouth-Kead.” 

B lustered the hosteler, “ *oo told 
’ee that? Mun be a lie!” 
“The man I got the information 
from is quite reliable,” Wulf-Leigh 
responded coldly. “I would not ad- 
vise you to deny it or I shall have 
to take strong measures.” 

Poor Will shivered. “And *ee’d 
be the man to do mun.” Then, a 
little defiantly. “Very well, my 
Lord. I own to mun. I be the 
Strand-gleaner for Exmouth and my 
father and his father before him as 
far back as our family Bible shows.” 
The Deputy Warden spoke 
through tautened lips with a grim 
smile on his face. “You are not 
setting up a prescriptive right ad- 
verse to the King, are you, Tavern- 
er? That is called constructive trea- 
son and the penalty is death — in 
the case of a commoner by hang- 
ing, or of a noble by the axe — 
forfeiture of all goods and chattels, 
attainder of real property and burial 
in Pauper’s Ground.” 

“My Lord,” sobbed the new ter- 
rified Devers, “ ’ee’d do mun to a 
poor man for picking a few gauds 
and baubles off the beach? ” 
“Don’t be alarmed. Will, I’m not 
going to do that to you yet. But 
you must work with me. You know 
the wreck of the Leveret three or 
four nights ago? There was a Cullen- 
lander washed up on the beach. He 
is reported by some powerful per- 
sons of my acquaintance to be carry- 
ing papers when he drowned. Do 
you have those papers?” 



The strand-gleaner hesitated a 
moment, weighing the advantages 
of truth against lie. Truth won. 
“Aye, m’Lord, I do; as I have most 
everything else I have ever gleaned 
from the strand. Mun be strand- 
gleaner’s law that he must hold 
and not sell the gifts of the sea lest 
he be in dire straits.” With which 
words he pulled out a two by four 
foot trunk and opened it to reveal 
the fruits of two hundred years of 
Devers’s gleaning. Bracelets, brooch- 
es, gold and silver candlesticks, 
piles of coins glittered dully along 
with leather objects, books, piles of 
banknotes still stained by the sea. 

The Baron Minor whistled in ad- 
miration. “There must be a million 
royals worth of goods in that chest. 
You’re a rich man. Landlord.” 

“ ’Ere mus’ be. But I’ve never 
counted mun. Mun be bad luck 
for a strand-gleaner to count his 
goods. Gaffer did mun, and the 
next day he got caught in a patch 
of sink-sand and was nought left o* 
him but his hat. ’Ere be the papers 
ye’re wanting. I broke the seal on 
the package and found nought but 
six o’ those five Naflon pieces and 
a silly letter.” He handed over a 
thin packet of oilskin . 

The government representative 
huffed imperiously, “You shouldn’t 
break seals, even Naflon seals. It’s 
a bad habit to get into. Silly letter, 
eh? What’s silly about it?” 

“See for yourself, m’Lord. Mun 
be nought to understand save the 
name at the end, Ian Macconnail. 
Mun be the name o’ one of the 
Cullenlanders rebels who fled to 
Naflon’s court.”

S ir Hubert looked at the now un- 
folded paper with growing in- 
terest and intensity. Aside from the 
bold signature of Ian Macconail 
there were eight lines divided into 
two groups, one of six lines and 
one of two. The first group read in 
large capital script: 

TXEAAXEBTXECBXED 

TXEEPXEFEXEGPXEHLXEI 

IXE.T CXEKTXELTXEMFXEN 

AXEOTXEPBXEQWXERRXES 

DXETTXEUTXEVFXEWLXEX

Then having a third of the page 
blank were the small case script 
letters : 

o.l.r.e.h.r.d.a.a.n.e.h.w.i.l. 

r.e.l.a.h.w.i.o.i.u. 

“Mun be queer, ben’t mun?” 
probed the innkeeper, breaking in 
on Wulf-Leigh’s iritense scrutiny. 

“Mun be queer indeed,” ironical- 
ly answered the safekeeper of the 
Ness. “It’s the kind of queer thing 
that deserves a further looking into 
by my office. Taverner Devers, I 
shall look into the possibility of get- 
ting you hereditable letters patent as 
strand-gleaner of Exmouth Head for 
the good service you rendered the 
commonweal in preserving this let- 
ter.” 

“ ’ee means,” squeaked the inn- 
keeper, “that mun’d be legal to 
glean the strand? I don’t know, sir. 
Would take all the joy out of mun, 
knowing mun were within the law. 
But thank ’ee kindly, sir.” 

“Ha!” the Warden teased tri- 



umphantly. “So you admit you’ve 
been acting outside the law! I could 
confiscate all your ill-gotten gains. 
But I shan’t. You shall have your 
letters patent at any rate. You may 
even keep five of the six Naflon 
sinkers that you have from the dead 
Cullenlander. I’ll need the sixth for 
evidence if the message reads as I 
think it will.” 

Will Devers was agog, trying to 
keep up with the fast-acting mind 
of the Ness chief. “ ’ee means ’ee’s 
solved mun?” 

“Not yet,” acknowledged Sir Hu- 
bert. “But I shall and soon. I would 
advise you strongly to say nothing 
of this to anyone. Let no one know 
that you gave me this paper; not 
even your wife.” 

The ex-Particular Clerk to the 
Board of Lord High Admirals open- 
ed the door of the counting room 
and walked out, the letter clutched 
in his fist, muttering: “So the Com- 
passionate brethren of St. Angus 
have friends whose family receives 
letters from Ian Maconnail. This will 
require looking into.” 

He came up into the chambers 
prepared for him, kissed his wife 
lightly as she waited his coming 
clad in a night-rail and with the 
pillows propped up behind her and 
then, lighting a spill from the low 
burning coals on the hearth, lit two 
tapers, took a sheet of paper from 
his dispatch case and set out to 
break the message. 

Lady Arabella watched for a few 
moments with impatience and an- 
noyance writ large on her face and 
finally spoke. “Darling — ” the 
endearment had an icy edge —

“aren’t you going to come to bed? 
I thought we were going to do noth- 
ing but enjoy ourselves at the inn. 
That can surely wait tiU morning.” 
“No, my dear.” Sir Hubert’s lips 
were taut. “I’m afraid it can’t. I

able hour of the morning so that 
none will suspect I’ve acquired and 
been working on important papers. 
Besides which I’m doing it in part

tone was less annoyed, more 
interesting. “How’s that?” 

“It pleases you to be Lady Depu- 
ty Warden of the Ness?” He waited 
her answering nod. “How would you 
like to be Milady Lieutenant of Cul- 
lenland?” 

“Pooh! No Baroness Minor could 
have that title. I’d have to be a 
Viscountess for that. You mean that 
paper — ” the daughter of Lord 
High Admiral Pepinard was born 
and bred to pride of place and pK>- 
sition as the reward of service — 
“can spell a viscount’s rank and the 
Lord Lieutenancy?” 

“I can’t be sure, but it jolly well 
might. We will have to solve it first, 
and then see what message the rebel 
Ian Maconnail is sending from his 
exile. Have I your leave to work 
on, lady love?” 

She made a half-comic moue of 
disdain, then murmured in a voice 
overlaid with tenderness: “Go on, 
my kind old work-donkey. You’d 
probably work with my leave or 
without, so go with your little game 
and make me a viscountess.” 

“Thank you, wife.” He used a 
gruff tone to hide his own growing 



passion, and turned again to the 
hidden message before him. 

He murmured aloud as his think- 
ing began to warm up: “Let’s see 
now; this can’t be too hard a cipher 
to break. It’s one designed to be read 
by men of limited education as most 
of these rebels are. This naturally 
limits the ingenuity of the code. 
Those letters X and E appear re- 
peated too often to be without mean- 
ing. Probably it marks something 
about the letters before and behind 
it. Now before is the most logical 
choice, so to think like a Cullen- 
lander, we’ll chose letters after. Let’s 
see now, XE A XE B C. Why, that’s 
nothing more or less than an alpha- 
betic progression! That’s a trap for 
the unwary cipher clerk and I 
walked into it a little. Let’s see what 
we get with the letters before it. 

“TATBTPEPLICTSSAT

doesn’t make sense. How I wish 
Groberd, the cipher clerk of the 
Lord High Admirals, were here 
now! How about those two bottom 
lines: they don’t have XE’s. in front 
of them. Maybe that’s meant as an 
interposition cipher. Let’s see now:

That’s not much better than the first 
essay. Let’s see what else mlg|ht

tions or do they delimit the words?

“So there’s the message to a needy 
family that the Father Superior of 
the Angusards was so concerned 
about! I think Captain Cruffin was 
right. They are a pack of Pantler- 
ists.” 

“So what are you going to do 
about it, my relentless husband?” 
Though the words were harsh, their 
tone was melting. 

His words were crisp and incisive 
as he pulled open his stock loosened 
and shed shirt and riding coat. “To- 
night, my dear, I will do absolutely 
nothing. We can’t go dashing into 
town alarming everyone and es- 
pecially the good brethren of St. 
Angus. Tomorrow morning we will 
ride sedately into town, and I shall 
call on the Father Superior and we 
shall indulge in a little mutual wool 
pulling — he over my eyes and I 
over his. After that I shall have a 
talk with my signal yeoman and see 
how our dry land mast and hoist 
oonmiunications system works with 
a message to Lindesnes. As for to- 
night, I have other fish to fry — 
beginning with a delicious little 
trout who is too fond — ” The 
warmth and tenderness in his voice 
belying even the mock anger in his 
words — “of calling her loving 
husband an old work-donkey.” 

“Wilfy.” Her voice melted into 
complete surrender. “Be gentle with 



me when you devour me, won’t 
you?” 

lU 

T he Deputy Warden’s coach 
drew up in front of the grim- 
facaded, weather-streaked, gray- 
stone building that housed the Pri- 
ory of the Order of St. Angus. The 
Lord Deputy kissed his wife lightly, 
dismounted from the coach and en- 
tered the ante-hall of the Priory. 

A novice of the order met him 
there and said he would announce 
him to the Father Superior. The 
ante-hall was dimly lit, as befitted 
the former ownership of the build- 
ing, a powerful noble family that 
had taken part in all the turmoils, 
intrigues and civil wars that had 
plagued Briden throughout the dark 
and middle ages and the beginning 
of the modem era. To a family of 
that sort, narrow slits of windows 
that arrows could be fired through 
or hot lead and oil dripped out of 
made sense. 

Two dim lamps called special at- 
tention to one of the walls, where 
a smoke-begrimed mural showed 
St. Angus bargaining with one of 
the pagan petty kings of ancient 
Cullenland for the freedom of a 
small enslaved boy. Sir Hubert was 
engrossed in studying this mural 
when Father Superior entered noise- 
lessly and coughed softly to attract 
Wulf-Leigh’s attention. 

“Ah, Father Superior, I’m glad 
to see you. You’re in good health?” 
“Better in health of the spirit, my 
Lord Deputy, than of the bcxiy; but 
we accept whatever bounties in that

matter the Lord bestows upon us. 
You, too, seem well. Your old liver 
complaint has not bothered you?” 

“Yes,” he huffed, “I enjoy good 
health and expect to fill the Lord’s 
commandment to be fruitful and 
multiply. You may wonder why I 
have come?” 

“I do,” the Angusard replied 
laconically. “I had hoped it might 
be concerned with the papers of the 
unfortunate Tachacullen — pardon 
me, you eastern folk would call him 
a Cullenlander, but we of the breed 
call them sons of Cullen or Tacha- 
cullen in the old tongue. His family 
may suffer great distress if they do 
not get their hands on the papers,” 

Sir Hubert could be a consumate- 
ly smooth liar when his country’s 
interests were at stake. He lied now: 
“I have some strong leads, Father, 
but they are still not ready for the 
oven. They are a close-mouthed lot, 
these men of the Ness shires, and 
they have some strange customs and 
odd beliefs. One of the customs is 
called strand-gleaning, the gathering 
of chattels spread along the beach 
by the dark angel of storms. I am 
fully convinced that the strand- 
gleaners have your unfortunate 
friend’s possessions. But I must move 
slowly and cautiously. These strand 
folk have some odd beliefs too.” 

“For instance?” The father’s 
voice was cold, his face an expres- 
sionless mask. 

“They all have a deep and abid- 
ing belief that you of the Con- 
fraternity are Pantlerists.” 

The eyes in the expressionless 
mask flickered for an instant — with 
hate, defiance, fear? — then the 



emotional visor dropped down 
again. “And you, what do you 
think? Are we Pantlerists?” 

Sir Hubert closed up his figura- 
tive helmet and gave back just as 
curtly as his adversary: “I believe 
nothing I cannot prove before a 
judge and jury to their satisfaction 
and that of the public hangman.” 
Now a faint smile cracked the 
mask. “Then you believe in our in- 
nocence of these absurd charges?” 

44X did not say that,” the Knight 
of the King’s Strand pointed 
up the fine distinction. “I said only 
that I was not convinced of your 
guilt. There’s a sharp difference 
between one and the other. There 
are two things I should like to know 
to that I can move more effectively 
against those holding the papers. 
First off, how did you know of his 
status as a messenger, and second, 
why this unseemly .haste about the 
delivery of the papers?” 

The priest answered cautiously: 
“It’s more or less a legal matter.” 
Seeing the raised eyebrows of the 
Deputy Warden, he explained hur- 
riedly, “You know the law of the 
deadman’s hand. It’s not in your 
Bridish law, but in Cullenland and 
some parts of Celtland, it is still 
held by. It is decreed that any prop- 
erty belonging to one who has 
passed must be delivered to either 
the inheritors, a chief or a priest 
of the Holy Church within ten days 
or else must be destroyed or buried 
with the deceased.” 

Sir Hubert grumped. “That’s a 
strange kind of law. What court 
handed it down?”

Father Superior raised his eyes to 
heaven momentarily as if calling 
upon the supernatural powers to 
free him from his tormentor. 
“That’s very old; the ancient code 
of Patran-na-Tachan, the fathers of 
the clan or Chiefs’ Law. It is very 
practical in dealing with property 
matters in courts where it is still 
observed.” 

“Oh, of course you mean the 
hedge courts. I’ve heard that they 
cause a great deal of trouble for 
Bridish justice. But even granting 
the jurisdiction and rightness of 
this law you still haven’t explained 
how you knew him to be a courier, 
and where from he was carrying 
messages.” 

The priest made the heaven- 
seeking grimace once ag3in. “You 
know, sir, that he had certain 
empty wallets and an empty money 
belt. There were certain marks on 
those wallets which proclaimed him 
a courier. As to the origin of his 
messages, that’s a trifle embarrass- 
ing. You know in the last Pant- 
lerist risings several hundred Tacha- 
cullen were forced to flee their 
land and settle in Fraunce. These 
men had family left jn the old 
land, helpless wives and children, 
aged mothers and disabled fathers. 
These men have grown old and 
died in the fifty years since that 
futile revolt but their sons and 
grandsons carry on the task. They 
serve in Freunch bodyguard troops. 
Since Naflon has seen fit to honor, 
to some extent, the Pantler claimant, 
they serve in the Pantler court and 
they send money home. They sup- 
port, 'kinfolk, orphanages, schools.” 



Sir Hubert had caught the priest 
in a lie, but he chose not to press 
his advantage. He knew that no 
wallets or money belts had been 
on the Cullenlander’s body when 
it was found. “Very well,” he lied 
blandly in retort, “these are good 
things. We shall for once forget 
about possible legal results of hav- 
ing intercourse with His Majesty’s 
enemies and shall endeavor to so 
press the folk of Exmouth so that 
you shall have the document in 
the ten days prescribed by the high 
and puissant court of the hedge- 
row. Good day. Father Superior.” 

N ess House was regarded as part 
of the Navy establishment. As 
a ‘result the Deputy Warden of the 
Ness had at his disposal a signal 
yeoman and a towering backyard 
mast that tied into a chain of masts 
that stretched across the country to 
provide for speedy communica- 
tions with Navy House, the head- 
quarters of the Board of Lord High 
Admirals. Now the youthful signaler 
came into the study of the master 
of Ness House, eager to end his 
long days of relative idleness. “You 
sent for me, sir. Have a message?” 
“No,” sarcastically drawled Sir 
Hubert. “I invited you here for a 
game of chess.” Changing to a more 
kindly tone, he went on: “Yes, I 
do^ have a message. You haven’t 
had too many during the last year 
so I hope your skills are up to it.” 
“Aye, sir. They are. Me and the 
other signal chaps keep our bands 
in with messages under a signal 
that warns practice message, disre- 
gard.”

IF 




“A good idea. But this message 
is not for practice. Make: Ness 
House to Navy House for trans- 
mittal to King’s First Minister. 
Have uncovered treasonous plot. 
Urgent you meet me. Cannot af- 
ford to move more than one day’s 
ride from Plymness, Wulf -Leigh 
Deputy Warden. Make that message 
with as few hoists as is possible. 
How long do you think that will 
take?” 

“That will take some doing, sir. 
Let’s see Ness House number, 
Navy House number, signal forward 
instead of transmit (with your leave, 
sir) King’s First Minister (one 
hoist for that) Use an event past 
hoist instead of have and the re- 
spondent signal for guns uncovered 
leaving off the guns pennant; 
treasonable, we’ll have to spell out; 
the Navy don’t have a signal for 
treason. Plot we can get easily 
enough — put up plot a course and 
leave off the signal for course. Ur- 
gent, thank the Lord is an easy one, 
almost all our Lord High Admirals’ 
messages have that hoist; meeting 
we’ll use another single hoist; 
numerical and a day sign; ride we’ll 
have to spell out, make the number 
for Plynmess. That’s twenty-five 
pennants at five seconds a hoist. 
That’s two minutes and five sec- 
onds. Allow ten seconds a pennant 
for make-ready. That’s four minutes 
and ten seconds or six minutes and 
fifteen seconds for the whole 
message. There are twelve masts to 
Navy House. Allow ten seconds a 
mast for alerting the yeomen and 
you get seventy-seven minutes to 
Lindesnes, allowing a half an hour 



to deUver the message to King’s 
first and seventy-five minutes foe 
return (everybody will be alerted 
by then). And you will have your 
answer in a little over three hours.” 

A ctually it was three hours and 
thirty-five minutes before the 
message came back: “Meeting 

agreeable. Expect you at Vaughanby 
house two hours after sunrise to- 
morrow. Vaughan King’s First Min- 
ister.” 

Vaughanby was a great, red-brick 
mansion in the Williamic style, built 
some men said by the graft and 
bribe-taking that were almost a 
prerequisite of a First Minister’s 
early years in the office. Now, with 
his material needs satisfied, Vaughan 
thirsted for glory and regard as a 
pre-eminent statesman. He seemed 
likely to get that meed of honor for 
his conduct of the Naf Ionic war. 

His greeting to Sir Hubert was 
traditionally laconic. “Well, Wilfly, 
you’ve gotten me to ride sixty 
leagues in a day. You’ve done the 
same. That message of yours had 
better be of earth-shaking impor- 
tance.” 

“It is, sir,” the Baron Minor as- 
sured him. “There is to be a rising 
in Cullenland, and to some extent 
the Confraternity of St. Angus of the 
Open Hand are subject to the charge 
of suborning the revolt.” 

“There is always a revolt coming 
in Cullenland,” the First Minister 
denigrated, as he led the way to the 
dining hall where a buffet table 
awaited them. “The skill in govern- 
ment is to find out when and who 
and how.”

“I can give you that information. 
The rising is set for dawn of the 
twenty-fifth to coincide with a 
Pantlerist landing in Celtland. Here 
are the proofs.” He spread out the 
coded letter and his copy of it, and 
demonstrated the way he had broken 
it down. The chief of the govern- 
ment was impressed and studied it 
carefully while Wulf-Leigh attacked 
a kipper and pewter mug of steam- 
ing tea. 

Now the First Minister showed 
some enthusiasm for the find. “This 
is good show, S’r’ubert. You’ve 
given us an exact date on the Pant- 
ler Landing which he expected but 
didn’t know quite when. But — ” 
here Vaugh frowned — “you’ve al- 
so thrown in a Cullenlander revolt 
which will divide our forces and 
may afford the Pantlerists some suc- 
cess.” 

“Suppose, sir, that the Cullenlan- 
der revolt and the Pantler landing 
failed to occur on the same day. 
Would that help?” 

“Would that help? By the bones 
of Henry Pantler, would that help! 
With four days leeway between them 
we could crush the Cullenlanders, 
recross the sea and still be in time 
to crush Edward Pantler when he 
lands in Celtland or vice versa. But 
how are you going to do it? How do 
you outwit a rather shrewd pack of 
rebels and the equally astute nest of 
Angusards whom you’ve unmasked 
or are going to unmask?” 

“My good Lord Vaughan,” the 
watcher of the western gate assured 
him, “I have some reputation for 
this sort of deception. In fact I’ve 
gotten the sword tap for King’s 



Strand for false-lighting the Freunch 
to their defeat above Plymness. If 
I can’t do the same to a bunch of 
Cullenlanders just as easily, I ought 
to turn back my sashes. Are you 
sure that given a four-days’ switch 
in the rebel plans you can outfight 
them?” 

“If you update the revolt by four 
days, I’m sure enough to promise 
you that I’ll turn in my seals of of- 
fice if I fail. You see, Macconnail 
has his strength concentrated in 
three areas, the back streets of El- 
more city, the glens around Duni- 
can Bay and in what were once, be- 
fore the rising that broke clan, the 
Macconnail lands north of Moiree. 
If we strike those three areas in 
overwhelming force, the rising will 
die a — boming. Do you need any 
help from Lindesnes?” 

Wulf-Leigh thought for a mo- 
ment then nodded, “There is one 
thing where you could help me. You 
have a certain influence with the 
court of Royal Assize and Jail De- 
livery sitting in Lindesnes?” 

Vaughan harumphed: “I have 

that influence. How do you choose 
to use it? You know it would help 
the war against Naflon no end to 
get the Cullenlander rebels off our 
backs and the Pantlerists over the 
hip.” 

The Baron Minor outlined the 
help he sought and got the promise 
full cooperation, including the use 
of a communcating mast at Vaugh- 
anby for a messa^ to Lindesnes to 
get the judges of Royal Assizes off 
to a running start on the necessary 
papers for the matter of his request. 

“Now — ” suddenly growing

saturnine — “there comes the bar- 
gaining. If you succeed in this de- 
sign, what quid do you want tor 
your quo? You surely didn’t go to 
all this trouble fcwr amusement 
alone.” 

Sir Hubert assumed a mask of in- 
jured innocence. “My Lord, my 
only concern is to better serve my 
country. But if rewards and punish- 
ments are to be handed out, my 
wife would dearly love the title 
of Viscountess.” 

“You sly dog,” chuckled the 
King’s First Minister, “that’s the 
shrewdest way to ask for a viscoun- 
ty that I ever heard. Make my wife 
a Viscountess, my Lord! Why, for 
that jape alone I’m half inclined 
to make you a Viscount whether 
you succeed or fail. And as for 
serving your country, what would 
you say to the Lord Lieutenancy of 
Cullenland when Lord Moreham 
steps down in about six months? 
You’ll keep of course the revenues 
from your present office. They’re 
an irrevocable life grant.” 

All the Warden could say was a 
simple, “Thank you, M’lord.” 

IV 

T hree days later, one night re- 
maining of the ten days allotted 
by the chiefs’ law of the dead hand, 
a little gamecock of a man was 
ushered into the Deputy Warden’s 
study and allowed to introduce him- 
self. “Me nyme’s Jemmy Fyker, 
your worship, a calligrapher from 
Lindesnes down by the post coach 
from Lindesnes, hat your service.” 
He made a sweeping bow. 



His worship was not amused. 
“Hold it, fellow. I have your fUe 
before me, and it says that you’re 
Jessamy Cowles, lagged for forgery 
and sentenced to three years at hard 
labor to be followed by the amputa- 
tion of your right thumb. If you’ll 
work honestly for me, I can prom- 
ise your thumb at least will be 
spared and your other punishment 
lessened. So no more of his Jem- 
my Fyker story.” 

“Hit ayn’t no loie, sir,” bristled 
the little man. “Me name’s been 
Jemmy for nigh six years and a 
calligrapher’s happrentice for six 
years before that. I’m a Grykie, hi 
haim, a real Grykie born not honly 
in the shadow o’ Gry Kirk o’ Fields 
but in the blooming rectory. Me pa 
was sexton. Hi was ’is second son. 
’Is heldest was to follow ’im as sex- 
ton so ’e happrenticed me to a cal- 
ligrapher. Six years did Jessamy 
Cowles lybor at the work and learn- 
ed hall that man could teach ’im. 
Then h’i asked for moi freedom 
and me journeyman’s pypers but 
the bond said seven years and ’e 
swore ’ed ’old me to hit. There was 
a bit of a wench hin it too, yer 
honor. So Hi swore hi’d py ’im

ture. ’E knew ’oo ’ad done hit but

took ’im awy to debtor’s jyle. My

ligrapher would tyke me on. They 
knew oi was too smart for them.

So Jemmy Fyker Hi became, hut- 
terer hof forged notes, false deeds 
and ^anything helse you moit 
need.” 

The Baron Minor’s comment was 
only a laconic: “How many times 
were you caught?” 

“Honly this once, yer ’onor,” 
came the proud reply, “hand 
wouldn’t ’ave been now if there 
’adn’t been a bit of a wench hin hit 
too. You see.” 

The Deputy Warden cut him off 
abruptly. “Enough romance. You’ve 
been brought by the post coach from 
Lindesnes to do a particular piece 
of work, and the question remains 
to be proven, how good are you at 
your craft?” 

“Hi’ll show you. Hi will. Wroite 
yer signature, sir. As a precaution, 
sir, lest Hi betempted, write hit with 
yer left ’and. Hi never loikes to see 
a man’s true signature when H’m 
workin’ for ’im”. 

Arabella’s husband scrawled a 
shaky and uncertain “Wulf-Leigh” 
on the sheet in front of him. Jemmy 
Fyker took a quick though intense 
look at it and then, quickly (or any- 
way relatively quickly) produced a 
copy indistinguishable from the 
original in every shake and squig- 
gle. 

“You’ll do,” gasped the Knight of 
the King’s Strand. “Now here’s 
what you must do.” So saying, he 
brought out the cipher note. 

Jemmy took one look at it and 
said: “Hi can’t do hit. That’s 

Freunchie pyper and Hi don’t sup- 
pose you’ve hany of that.” 

Sir Hubert smiled. “The Navy 
can work miracles too.” He reach- 



ed into his draw and took out a 
dozen sheets of identical weave linen 
paper. To the astonished forger, 
he explained laconically, “From a 
prizer auction, you know. For your 
share in this, I’ll give you two hun- 
dred pounds, and Lord Vaughan will 
get you a King’s Covenanted Par- 
don if our plan works.” 

For once Jemmy Fyker was al- 
most silenced. He burbled a feeble 
“Crikey!” and set to work. The mes- 
sage from Macconnail was in the 
hands of the Augusard brothers on 
the fourth of the month, within the 
limits of the Chiefs’ Law of the 
dead hand. By the seventh of the 
month certain messages were going 
through the back-roads and byways 
of Cullenland. Men uprooted 
hearthstone flags and unwound the 
wrappings form long secreted mus- 
kets; axes were sharpened, broad- 
swords taken from ornamental dis- 
plays and whetted for grimmer use. 

I n Briden too, preparations were 
made. On the seventeenth an up- 
land loyalist regiment and two 
squadrons of Celtland dragoons 
sailed across the broad strait that 
was miscalled the Cullenlander Sea 
and marched across the northern 
part of Cullenland, timing their 
march to arrive in Moires late in the 
evening of the twentieth. On the 
same evening two regiments usually 
stationed in the Middle Counties and 
four squadrons of King William’s 
household Cavalry arrived in the 
near shore glens of Dunnican Bay. 
Three companies of marines and a 
regiment of the Ness-shire militia, 
blooded and battle-proven against

the ^Freunch assault, also made a 
dark of night landing in Elmore. 

On the twenty-first at dawn the 
revolution exploded but there were 
too many troops in just the right 
places to wet it down. By noon of 
the twenty-third the back of the re- 
volt was broken and most of the 
troops could be withdrawn, put back 
on the ships that had brought them 
and sailed back across the Cullen- 
lander Sea to be ready for the Pant- 
ler Pretender when that worthy 
landed near Overwick. 

By the twenty-seventh Edward 
Pantler was being marched south- 
ward, not at the head of his troops 
but as a state prisoner bound for 
trial and execution at Lindesnes 
Castle. 

On the thirtieth, the Father Su- 
perior of the Confraternity of St. 
Angus was announced as the Lord 
Deputy was breakfasting. Hospitably 
Sir Hubert invited him to enter. 
“A very good morning to you, your 
worship. You’ll have some eggs and 
a rasher of bacon.” Noting the pain- 
ed expression on the Byzantine 
churchman’s face he shrugged. “Ah, 
yes, it’s one of your meager days. 
Then how about a kipper? Make 
free of the sideboard. There’s tea 
and a half-jug of an excellent bever- 
age called perry by way of bever- 
ages. Can I help you in any way. 
Father?” 

The priest gulped hard as if about 
to swallow a nasty dose and spoke 
in a low voice. “I am afraid I must 
confess some liability for the recent 
rising in Cullenland. You see. Lord 
Deputy, I was not quite frank in our 
last interview. I knew that the un- 



fortunate man who was cast ashore 
from the wreck of the Leveret was 
a Macconnail courier. I knew that 
which he carried was a cipher calling 
the people of Cullenland to a revolt. 
I saw the message was forwarded 
to the proper people. So much in- 
nocent blood lies on my poor 
head.” 

“To which, Reverend Father,” 
answered a grim-faced Wulf-Leigh, 
“may be added your own. You re- 
alize that your last statement re- 
peated in front of witnesses can 
bring your conviction on a charge 
of High Treason; and we do not 
allow the benefit of clergy in this 
country any more. My own testi- 
mony alone is not sufficient to con- 
vict, you, but I can and should have 
you bound over to the examining 
magistrates of His Majesty’s Court 
of High Justice.” 

The Father Superior shrugged, 
raised his eyes toward heaven as 
though welcoming a martyr’s crown. 
“Bind me over; bring your witness- 
es; none of your courts can punish 
me worse than I am punished al- 
ready.” He threw up his arms in a 
gesture of despair and desolation. 
“Behold a shepherd who has lost 
his flock.” 

The baron Minor relaxed slightly 
his grim-set jaw. “Ah, perhaps my 
Lord Vaughan already has heard 
this and decreed banishment. If my 
poor influence can insure the soften- 
ing of your exile — ” 

The Angusards’ leader smiled 
weakly. “No, your lordship, the 
King’s first minister knows naught 
of this. I am banished by a far 
sterner tribunal, the hearts and wills

of my people. You know that I am 
charged with the aid of unfortunate 
and desolate Cullenlanders. So when 
a shipload of poor prisoners arrived 
in Plymness yesterday from Elmore 
city, already tried and sentenced to 
be shipped to the penal colonies in 
the Antipodes, I and a dozen of 
my brothers in the Lord went down 
to aid them and ease their suffering. 
They would have none of our com- 
forts. They said we had betrayed 
them, that too many Bridish troops 
had arrived too soon. They had 
learned from the over-boastful gaol- 
ers that even the comfort of aiding 
the success of the Pantlerist landing 
by their demonstration had been 
dendied them. So they turned a deaf 
ear to our prayers and answered 
our supplications by pelting us with 
hard bread. The captin then ordered 
us from the ship and chided us for 
disturbing his prisoners. Come 
noose, come axe; you can hurt me 
no worse.” 

The Deputy Warden looked long 
and hard at the man of the cloth 
before replying. “I think you’re 
right. No punishment that our jus- 
tice can mete out will hurt you 
more than that which you have al- 
ready received at the hands of your 
own people. Now if you would write 
a statement of your involvement. .” 

He paused as the prelate drew 
out a scroll and handed it to him 
across the desk, then examined the 
missive and stuffed it into a cubby- 
hole. “That’s just right. It will serve 
as — shall we say — insurance 
against your further involvement in 
Pantlerist plots. With Edward Pant- 
ler waiting the axe, and the old 



King clamant enfeebled by age, 
there won’t be any plotting now for 
a generation. All true believers will 
be more cautious next time.” 

At this last phrase the priest’s 
eyebrows rose suddenly. Bereft for 
a moment of speech he could do no 
more than point an accusatory finger 
at the baron minor. The baron minor 
in matched silent byplay nodded, 
smiled and fixed the prelate with 
a stare, as if to say: “That’s right, 
I knew of your letter and gave you 
an altered copy which caused the 
rising to be premature. Now you 
know it but you can’t prove it.” 
But all he said aloud was, “Good 
day. Father.” END

THE N3F AND OTHERS 

by LIN CARTER 



Our Man in Fandom shows us 
the wonderful world of fan 
clubs that span the planet! 



The Coast-to-Coasters 

L ast month in this space we were 
talking about the science-fic- 
tion superclubs that were a natural 
out growth of the “itch to organ- 
ize” that has always been rife in sf 
fandom. First the local clubs, then 
the state organizations, then as 
a logical progression, somebody 
comes up with the idea that there 
should be a coast-to-coast organi- 
zation covering the whole country 
and incorporating all of the science- 
fiction fans in one whopping big 
fanclub. 

I told you about some of the 
early ones, like THE SCIENCEERS 
organized by Negro fan James Fitz- 
gerald, the TERRESTRIAL FAN- 
TASOIENCE GUILD, and the 
half-dozen or so other Leagues, 
Associations, Fraternities, Legions 
and whatever, culminating in the 



one superclub that really worked 
and really did somesthing, the SCI- 
ENCE FICTION LEAGUE, found- 
ed by Hugo Gemsback and Char- 
les D. Hornig and sponsored by 
Wonder Stories. The SFL lasted 
some years before Wonder was sold 
to another publisher and the local 
chapters began to split off, dissat- 
isfied with the autocratic, central- 
ized structure of this, the world’s 
largest sf fan club. In its time, 
though, the League actually had 
several thousand members, and 
chapters from one end of the coun- 
try to the other, including branches 
overseas. 

Even though the mighty League 
collapsed at last, it did serve as an 
example of just how big and influ- 
ential a national club could be, and 
it was an example worth striving to 
emulate in the years that followed. 
Here are some of the emulators . 



78 




The Big Associations 

Even before Gemsback’s SFL 
had gasped its last gasp, there were 
people trying to revivify the not- 
quite-extinct cadaver. A small group 
which split off from the East New 
York chapter of the SFL attempted to 
get the ball rolling with a thing called 
THE INDEPENDENT LEAGUE 
FOR SCIENCE FICTION, but 
the ball refused to roll and the 
whole thing went under in 1936. 
The following year THE AMERI- 
CAN FANTASY ASSOCIATION 
got going. It planned an “official 
organ” (I’m sorry, but that’s what 
club magazines are called, echh, 
what an awkward term I) to be 
named The American Fantasy Mag- 
azine, but the organ died in embryo 
as did its parent organization. 

Across the pond in Britain, 
meanwhile, another association was 
founded. Called simply THE SCI- 
ENCE FICTION ASSOCIATION, 
it was open to U.S. members and did 
indeed have some Amerifans in it. 
The SFA’s main business was put- 
ting on conventions, and through it 
the British fen organized three an- 
ual cons — each bigger and better 
than the last, according to reports. 
The Association looked forward to 
a bright add happy future, but then 
along came something called World 
WAR II, and in the fuss and flurry 
it became dormant. 

The Science Fictioneers 

I suppose it was inevitable, given 
the success of Wonder's Science 
Fiction League (which must have 



helped boost circulation and multi- 
ply reader-interest in tihe magazine), 
that another prozine eventually try 
the experiment. The one that did 
was a now-defunct magazine called 
Super Science Stories, not at all a 
bad magazine in its day, home of 
many good Kuttner and Asimov 
yarns. 

Super Science announced a club 
called THE SCIENCE FICTIQN- 
EERS, which was to be modeled 
pretty closely on Gernsback’s 
League. The magazine printed 
names and addresses * of members 
as they wrote in and organized local 
branches here and there, but never 
as many as the League ihad. The 
Science Fictioneers, while a pale 
shadow of the great League of yore, 
did at least get some clubs going in 
vicinities where no club had prev- 
iously been organized. The thing 
might just possibly have succeeded 
in being another giant-size League, 
but (again!) World War II came 
thundering in, and a nasty corol- 
lary, the paper shortage, killed the 
magazine, and the club died in- 
stanter. 

But then, around 1943 or there- 
abouts, something new came on the 
scene. It was so ambitious, sound- 
ed so active and so very promising, 
that it took a little time for people 
to realize just how vague and screwy 
it was. I am talking about: 

The Crazy Days of The Cosmic Circle 

There was once a fan named 
Claude Deglcr. He wandered about 
the country hitch-hiking and bus- 
riding, trying single-‘handedly to

organize the nation’s fans into an sf 
superclub to end all superclubs . 
rather like Peter the Hermit, who 
went about rabble-rousing for the 
First Crusade. Degler’s crusade was 
for THE COSMIC CIRCLE; no- 
body ever quite knew what it was, 
but from all the noise and excite- 
ment, it was going to be BIG, with 
a capital B, I, and G. 

Degler the Hermit contacted fans 
all over the country, chiefly through 
names and addresses printed on let- 
ters in the prozines; he announced 
in grandiose terms his Circle, urged 
them to lurk about newsstands in 
their town and sign up anybody 
who bought sf magazines, offered 
them all sorts of charters and 
things and generally cut loose in 
fifteen different directions with a 
flurry of activity that made most 
fans look sluggish. 

He announced local sectors of 
the Cosmic Circle like one in Ten- 
nessee called “The Circle of Atzor” 
and the “Alabama All-Fans” and 
the “Valdosta Philosophers” in 
Georgia. Other local or regional 
branches of the Cosmic Circle ex- 
isted (on paper at least, or in Deg- 
ler’s feverish imagination anyway) 
in Florida, Louisiana, Indiana and 
so on. 

The Cosmic Circle was supposed 
to be a union of anybody anywhere 
who had a “cosmic outlook.” Al- 
most at once, the CC claimed 200 
members, but it was hard to tell ex- 
actly who really did belong to it, be- 
cause Degler filled his various “of- 
ficial” publications with pseudo- 
nymous writings. In fact, Claude 
used so many pen names and men- 



tioned so many fictitious members, 
that it was never easy at any given 
time to say whether this or that 
Cosmic Circle member was a real 
person or just another facet of the 
fabulous Degler personality. 

These magazines poured out in 
fantastic numbers — The Cosmic 
Circle Commentator and Fanev^s 
Analyzer and even one called Spicy 
Spaceship Stories{\). Claude plan- 
ned to stir up so much excitement 
with all these magazines as to cre- 
ate the illusion of a giant, multi- 
state organization throbbing and 
rumbling in back of him. But not 
too many people were fooled, and 
it quickly became apparent that 
most of the “contributors” to this 
deluge of fanzines were Degler him- 
self, writing under phoney names. 

Degler certainly thought big. He 
announced the formation of region- 
al Circle organizations in Oklaho- 
ma and New Mexico and Nevada. 
He launched a flurry of special fan- 
service bureaus: a National Fan 

Directory, a fan vacation camp in 
Arkansas, a Circle Amateur Pub- 
lishers Alliance with a circulation of 
500 (which was mighty interesting, 
since at this time Circle member-

gional organizations, a Dixie Fan- 
tasy Federation, a Southern Cir- 
cle, a Gulf Circle, a Northwest Fed- 
eration, a United Califans, Utah 
Cosmic Fans, and so on. He bom- 
barded real fandom with a snow- 
storm of weekly fanzines, news bul- 
letins and such and even — perhaps 
from sheer hysteria — even an- 
nounced a summer school for the

cosmically-minded kids of fans! 

It was all a bit too much. Work- 
ing on the theory that the CC could 
be laughed out of its pseudo exis- 
tence, some irate fans in Boston 
produced a magazine called the 
Trivial Triangle Troubadour, which 
was a lampoon of things Deglerian. 
Francis T. Laney, prominent fan 
of the period followed with the Com- 
ic Circle Commentator (“comic” 
— not “cosmic”). Another lam- 
poon was called the Caustic Square 
Commentator. Fan-wit Bob Tuck- 
er dealt the death-blow, by pre- 
tending to found an organization 
yclept The Cosworms. 

The whole thing collapsed like a 
house of cards. And it came out 
somewhile later that Degler had re- 
putedly been committed some years 
before to a hospital for the insane 
(around 1936-37) and had been al- 
legedly released against the advice 
of his doctors. That did it. No won- 
der! 

The National Fantasy Fan Federation 

Then there’s the one coast to- 
coaster that did work and actually 
out-performed even the League. The 
World Science Fiction Convention 
of 1941 was held in Denver, Colo- 
rado and was called “The Denven- 
tion,” the name coined by Donald 
A. Wollheim. Damon Knight gave 
a speech calling for the creation 
of a central fan organization. In 
those days, Damon Knight was a 
leading fan; today, of course, he is 
a leading science-fiction writer. Af- 
ter taking a poll of fans for their 
ideas and after enlisting their sup- 

THE NBF AND OTHERS 



port. Knight and Arthur Widner 
launched The National Fantasy Fan 
Federation, called the “N3F” or the 
“NFFF’ and pronounced “Neff.” 
A general election was held, and a 
constitutio i was drawn up and fin- 
ally agreed upon. 

The first president of the N3F 
was Louis Chauvenet (the guy 
who coined the word “fanzine”). 
America’s entry into World War II, 
that old bugaboo of fandom, ham- 
pered the beginning of the N3F, 
but, after a slow, steady start, it 
picked up speed. The original idea 
was to include all U.S. fans and 
divide the country into regional 
^oups of affiliated local clubs, with 
a central administrative core of 
elected officers, an advisory board 
and several committees, including 
some sort of legal or judiciary body. 
These visionary goals never got to 
working. 

The National Fantasy Fan Feder- 
ation is the only nation-wide central 
fan organization that ever really 
worked or lasted, not counting the 
amateur press associations. It is 
still with us, believe it or don’t and 
has recently celebrated its first 
quarter century of existence. 

What Hath Damon Knight Wrought? 

If you are eager to get into the 
fan world, there is no better way to 
do it than to join the N3F (unless 
there is a local fan club in your vi- 
cinity). To do so, send $2.00 to 
Janie Lamb, Route 1, Box 3664, 
Heiskell, Tenn. 37754. 

You will be on the receiving end 
of a swarm of friendly letters from 

81 




members of the Welcom^ or ““wel- 
coming committee” — the recruit- 
ing adjunct of the Federation. You 
will ako get two official bi-month- 
ly magazines, Tight beam and The 
National Fantasy Fan, and a host 
of little brochures called “fan- 
books” which will initiate you into 
various aspects of fanning, such as 
the world of fan publishing, the 
amateur press associations, and so 
on, including a booklet-dictionary 
of fan jargon. 

Also, as a Neffer, you will be 
able to check the membership list 
which may give names and address- 
es of fans in your hometown you 
never knew were there. You may 
want to get in touch v^th veteran 
Neffer, Seth Johnson, 339 Stiles St., 
Vaux Hall, N.J. 07088. Seth is a 
tireless correspondent, who likes to 
talk and give encouragement to 
newcomers in fandom. Through his 
Fanzine Clearing House you can for 



$1.00 get an assortment of recent 
fanzines which will show you the 
sort of thing that’s going on these 
days. 

I suggest you stay in the NFFF 
for no longer than a year, for the 
valuable ’’introduction to fandom” 
material I’ve described above is 
about all you’ll really get for your 
membership. Unhappily, Damon 
Knight’s dream of a central fan 
organization never got off the 
ground. The NFFF never actually 
did anything in fandom. It just sort 
of sits there, big and old and full 
of members, but never does much. 
If all you want from fandom is a 
few long-distance friends to trade 
letters with, it will be just what you 
are looking for. But if you happen 
to be interested in getting into the 
middle of the real fan world, the 
Neiffers have nothing for you. 

Still, why not give ’em a try, 
if you’re interested? END

THE 

CASTAWAYS 

by Jack B. Lawson 



Smith's World was rough but 
not fatal — except to people 
who were half dead already! 



Qhip’s log would tell Sherril Kierzek 
O only two things. First, the 
voyage to Smith’s World had lasted 
14.533337 years so far, leaving 
— as she remembered the schedule, 
anyway — something more than 
four years to go. And second, she’d 
been defrosted on instructions from 
Lewis Cathcart, who was at present 
drinking in the observatory. 

And that was where she found 
him. He was a small, bony man with 
the orangish complexion common to 
people who had switched to Rich- 
ard’s blood, and he was floating in 
the exact center of the room and 
sneering at the nipple on the brandy 
bottle. 

“Here,” he said and pushed the 



bottle at her. “We’re lost, you’re go- 
ing to need a drink.” 

She deflected the bottle, brought 
it to rest against the wall. 

“What does that mean? Are we 
going to die?” 

“It means we’re as likely to end 
up in the Land of the Boojums as 
Smith’s World. Or more precisely, 
we might not end up at all. Left to 
itself this thing we’re on isn’t ever 
going to decide to slow down.” 

“It won’t tell me anything. Just, 
you had me waked up. You’re a 
logician, aren’t you?” 

Cathcart had drifted to the far 
wall and lay stretched out against 
it, arms and legs spread wide. 

“We used to call this making an 



83 




angel,” he said, twisting his head 
up to look at himself. “When you 
jumped into a snowbank in this po- 
sition.” 

“Is that supposed to tell me some- 
thing? An oblique way of saying 
we’re going to die, or what? If you 
— You do know what’s wrong, 
don’t you? The ship did tell you?” 
“It’s a human-solution problem,” 
he said. “Of course I had to be ex- 
posed to a full report; but you 
weren’t, 'so your interpretation 
wouldn’t get contaminated — sup- 
posing I Wanted an interpretation 
from yotf, which I don’t. Ship’s log 
was just being discreet.” 

“It’s not the only one being coy 
either, is it? Please, Lewis. What’s 
wrong?” 

4 4 understand anything at 

jLJ all about the guidance sys- 
tem on one of these things? Space- 
craft?” 

“No. Well, I suppose I can see 
roughly .... You couldn’t very 
well aim it ahead of time, could you? 
Not over eighteen and a half light- 
years.” 

“God. Of course not. You couldn’t 
possibly figure out where to end up 
close, the universe isn’t all that tidy.” 
“And you wouldn’t just lock on 
to the light from your destination. 
You’d want to lead it, and that 
would mean maps and some way of 
comparing them with observational 
data, and deciding what to do on 
that basis. It shouldn’t be very dif- 
ficult.” 

“Right. Only it’s a little more 
complicated. Of course. Comparing 
the maps, and what’s out there — ” 



he pointed at the silver-gray lens of 
the scope — “takes two pieces of 
equipment. A collating machine and 
a selector. Our trouble’s in the select- 
or. A thing like that can be practical- 
ly feebleminded, you know. It’s given 
a few rules — basically an axiom 
set — and in conjunction with the 
collation results, these tell it to go 
on pulling maps at such and such 
intervals and in such and such order. 
Or else the view doesn’t match up 
quite and the collator measures the 
inconsistency. Then the selector in- 
forms control, determines which map 
the view’s going to look like when 
the ship gets back on course and 
starts a new sequence from there. 
Feebleminded, essentially. Not a job 
that ordinarily calls for very stiff 
reasoning, of course.” 

Cathcart pushed away from the 
wall and drifted past the scope, 
managed to drag a foot against the 
floor, swing around and come back 
to it. “Here,” he said, waving his 
finger over the row of buttons. He 
poked one and almost floated out of 
reach of the machine before he 
caught a handgrip and stopped. 

The lens blackened and a swan- 
shaped blur formed over three-quar- 
ters of its surface, and then the blur 
resolved into a cloud of stars and in 
the corners around the swan other 
stars pricked through the darkness. 
Just where the neck curved into the 
head was an intense jab of white, 
and below, in an isosceles triangle 
within the swan’s breast, flared 
three more noticeably bright stars, 
the apex one with a istinctly green 
tinge. 

“Smith’s World,”. Cathcart said.

tapping the lower righthand side of 
the lens. “Which we’ll never get to. 
Because there aren’t any maps with 
this thing on them.” He touched 
the bright star in the swan’s neck. 
“The rock of our shipwreck. As far 
as our selector’s concerned, a sky 
with that in it is imaginary. Certain- 
ly no place to go.” 

CCXJova,” Sherril said. “If it’s not 
on the maps — that’s what it 
has to be, isn’t it?” 

Cathcart punched another button 
and the lens went back to silver- 
gray. 

“So now you know. Very funny, I 
think. What you have to do is suck 
the bottle and sort of stroke the 
nipple toward the tip with your 
tongue. You can work up a whole 
swallow with patience.” 

She finally got some of the bran- 
dy down. 

“But we’ll die, Lewis! The ship 
will never know when to slow down. 
We’ll just go on past and — ” 
“Exactly what I was telling you.” 
“But can’t we — the ship defrost- 
ed you, can’t you think of a way 
out? Can’t you get this selector to 
ignore the nova? I mean, if — ” 

“Oh, if the machine had any 
brains to speak of, there are lots 
of things I could do. But the thing 
is, it doesn’t. It’s set up to do what 
I told you. Find a certain map at a 
certain time. Pass it on to the colla- 
tor. And if anything’s wrong, trans- 
late the inconsistency into course- 
correction instructions and pass these 
on to control. Of course, there are 
inconsistencies and inconsistencies.” 
“Don’t p>eople know when a star’s 



going to nova? This ought to have 
been anticipated.” 

“No doubt. But that isn’t going to 
help us now.” 

“Anyway, my field’s microbiolo- 
gy,” she said. “Cross-strand modifi- 
cation. What do you think I can 
do?” 

Cathcart made a queer shrugging 
motion, as if putting his head down 
between his shoulders. 

“I got you up because it was cold 
and silent and I felt lonely, if you 
really have to know.” 

She floated across and 4^>ok his 
hand between hers, skin on skin. 

“Like that?” she said. 

“Yes. Thanks.” He looked off, at 
the bottle rotating slowly over by 
the door. “I think what I really want 
is my mother.” 

“But there’s nothing you can do?” 

“Oh, I can do something. Two 
kinds of thing, to be precise. I can 
change the rules the selector works 
from by erasing the whole set and 
starting over. Not very helpful, since 
I haven’t any idea what to start over 
with. Or I can add something to the 
present rules.” 

“What would that mean? You 
wouldn’t have much chance of put- 
ting in anything but an imaginary 
new destination, would you?” 

“Well, there’s an enormous map 
file — several hundred million, the 
log claims. Suppose I eliminated one 
of the rules of selection, added its 
contradictory to the axiom set, say. 
Only ^ne of those determines the 
point at which the ship must begin 
to slow down, so I’d have a fair 
chance of missing that one. In fact, 
I think I know which one to avoid.”

“Then we’ll go somewhere?” Sher- 
ril said, stroking the back of his 
hand. “Only not to Smith’s World, I 
suppose.” 

“Hardly. Actually, that’s one place 
you can be sure we won’t go. But 
we’ll probably go somewhere like it 
— ^Earthlike planets are characteris- 
tic of a certain class of sun, as I 
remember.” 

“Yes. Only I don’t think it works 
out perfectly. Sometimes there’s just 
nothing. It jdepends on ... She was 
silent for a minute, staring at the up- 
per lefthand corner on the far side 
of the room. “I don’t remember. It’s 
been a long time since I had basic 
astronomy.” 

“Me too. Well, probably we’ll head 
for the right kind of sun. The point 
of mo^ rules has to be to eliminate 
certain map sequences, so what I’ll 
be doing is opening up some of the 
other possibilities. Hopefully, at 
least one of these won’t be ruled out 
by the nova. But we’ll have to see 
what turns up. If anything.” 

omething did. 

It was almost thirty light-years 
away, according to ship’s log — a 
fat, green planet spongy with lakes 
and capped at one pole by an enor- 
mous splay of ice. There was even 
the right sort of atmosphere — or 
so Sherril interpreted the specto- 
graph. But there were no plowed 
fields, no roads, no citydomes, no 
ring of satellites. Where ever they 
were, it was outside the human uni- 
verse. 

Cathcart got himself into the 
exact center of the room again and 
floated there, spinning slightly, with 



his hands clasped together across 
his shins and his eyes closed, while 
Sherril explained things to Jane 
Shaw and Todd Braithwate, who 
were teachers and who watched her 
lips with wide, intent eyes in still 
faces, and to Richard Ronaldson, 
who came in last, broad-shouldered 
and vague, and then kept drifting 
away to make faces at the planet in 
the scope. He was a poet. 

“So what do we do now?” he said 
finally. “There aren’t any people 
down there.” 

“We go down, obviously,” Cath- 
cart said, without opening his eyes. 
“And then there will be.” 

“That’s crazy. There’s no point.” 

“Let’s think of it as an adventure,” 
Jane Shaw said in a gray voice. 

Todd wagged an open hand at 
the scope. The blue of his eyes al- 
most matched the lake color. 

“Yes. Dick’s right. I say we should 
try again. I agree, Lewis, you did 
the only possible thing. Acted very 
cleverly. But this place won’t do, 
surely you see that. And next 
time — ” 

“No doubt. But we’ve got no 
choice, you have to consider that. 
No next time. There probably isn’t 
enough fuel left to get, us out of this 
system. At least I’d hate to try it.” 
Cathcart opened his eyes and grinned 
at Todd. “So whatever we should 
do — ” and he finished it with a 
high shrug. 

“But there aren’t any people down 
there,” Ronaldson said again, show- 
ing his teeth around that word “peo- 
ple.” 

“Really, I think we can live,” said 
Sherril. “Lewis and I went over the 



86 



IF 




whole thing carefully. The big risk 
was that we’d end up somewhere 
without food. But we’re in luck. All 
that green is live stuff, you know.” 
“So you trust,” said Cathcart. 
“And the ship has a doctor of 
sorts. Well, what else is there? We’ll 
have to do without all the pills 
civilized people take, I suppose. And 
so on. Oh, we’ll have some problems, 
but think about it. There’s nothing 
but brute physical nature down 
there. We’re the end products of six 
thousand years of civilization, intelli- 
gent human beings, and what — ” 
“Especially me,” said Cathcart. 
“Speaking of end products. I happen 
to have Richard’s blood. Excellent 
stuff, keeps you young longer and 
cuts in half the time you need to 
put in sleeping. But it doesn’t renew 
itself. I’ll be dead inside three 
weeks.” 

4 C T didn’t think about that,” 
A Sherril said after a while. 

“I couldn’t get up nerve to ask 
you,” he said. “But of course there’s 
nothing you could do, is there?” 

“It would take — a high speed 
oscillator and an EEH microscope 
equipped with waldoes, and who 
knows what else? That’s not really 
my field, you know — actually doing 
things. I’m more on the math side. 
Sorry. Very sorry, Lewis.” 

“Already down to four little In- 
dians,” Ronaldson said, perhaps to 
the scope or the image of the planet 
on it. “Oh, we will have some prob- 
lems, no doubt.” 

“I gather the idea is,” Todd said, 
pointing his finger first at Cathcart, 
then Sherril, “we’re going to be 



colonists. Pioneers, first settlers, peo- 
ple like that?” 

“Well, what do you think?” she 
said. “Maybe I’m the one who’s be- 
ing stupid just because he doesn’t 
like the situation. Maybe we’ve got 
some other choice, a whole higgle- 
depig of choices maybe.” 

“There are people like that,” Jane 
Shaw said. “Certainly used to be. 
People who got out away from the 
human race. We’ll have to figure out 
their psychological set. See how do- 
ing that sort of thing can make 
sense.” 

“Ha,” said Ronaldson. 

Todd swung both hands wide, the 
motion skewing him to ihis left and 
floating him free of the wall. 

“I bet nobody has even considered 
whether it is possible to get down 
there — to raise one more stupid 
objection before we go on with this 
foolishness.” 

“The ship has an emergency 
landing unit,” Cathcart said. “Why, 
God knows. Vestigial, maybe — 
something regulations demanded a 
long time ago, and the shipbuilders 
never got around to asking if they 
could take it out.” 

All of them except Cathcart look- 
ed again at the image of the planet, 
green and blue and white, with beige 
flecks around the equator and a 
crooked mountain range winding up 
shortly and then disappearing under 
the icecap. The shadowline began 
on the other side of the mountains. 

“So we are actually going down 
there to live,” Todd said in a slow 
voice. 

“Tom are,” Cathcart said. “Not 
me. I’m going there to die.”

Sheril then gave him her hand. 
“The rest of us aren'tT Ronald- 
son said, shrill, turning away from 
the scope. “You know better! All of 
you! There isn’t a thing we can do 
down there except squat around a 
natural fire and wait to die. So what 
if it takes thirty years instead of 
three weeks That’s some kind of 
advantage?^'' 

“Well, isn’t even that better than 
going around the universe in a cake 
of ice?” Sherril said. 

Ronaldson showed teeth and made 
a noise something like a voiced hiss. 
“I wouldn’t be sure,” Todd added. 
“Besides, it’s not as if we were so 
dependent on civilization. We’re k. 
We carry a lot of it around in our 
heads, you know. Why can’t we make 
things civilized down there?” 

“I’m a poet'^ Ronaldson told her. 
“Just what Godforsaken use do you 
think I am, to myself or anybody 
else, without a computer?” 

“People used to make up poems 
by themselves,” Jane Shaw offered. 
“Without computers.” 

“No question about it. I’ve seen 
poetry like that. Somebody made it 
up for himself, all right. You can 
tell.” 

“There are other things,” Sherril 
said. “I mean, later.” 

“Not for me there aren’t.” 

“What I started to say, later on 
there’ll be babies, you know. That’ll 
be one of the consequences of doing 
without pills.” 

“What are the pills all for, I won- 
der?” Todd flapped his hands loose- 
ly. “It can’t very well be to keep me 
from having babies.” 

“You mean — have them our- 



selves?” said Jane Shaw and looked 
at her groin. “Inside us? That 
doesn’t sound like a very good idea.” 
“It’s a perfectly feasible way,” 
Sherril said. “That’s sort of my field. 
I can assure you it works. Why not?” 
“And your children will have chil- 
dren,” Caithcart said. “Also by them- 
selves. And your children’s children, 
and so on, and eventually when hu- 
man beings get out to wherever we 
are, they’ll find they’re already here.” 
“Perhaps we’ll be rescued some 
day,” Jane Shaw said. 

“Some of those children will be 
yours, too, you know,” Sherril told 
Cathcart in a softer voice, tightening 
her grip on his hand. 

“No. I don’t know that. There’s 
nothing different about the shape of 
your stomach.” 

“That takes time.” 

Todd got a toe against the wall 
and pushed himself toward the scope. 

“We’ll have to build things,” he 
said, making square chops in the air 
with stiff straight hands. “Using na- 
tural materials. It will make for some 
interesting problems.” 

“Impossible’s the word,” Ronald- 
son said. 

“Let’s just agree to do what we 
can,” Jane Shaw said. “We all know 
it’s a horrible situation, but if we 
don’t take a positive attitude about 
it, it will be impossible.” 

“No,” Cathcart told her. “I’ve 
done my share already, and my situ- 
ation is impossible right now. I don’t 
intend to do anything. Or to be agree- 
able either, for that matter.” 

“You’ve aleardy done a miracle, 
haven’t you?” Sherril said. “You got 
us a world to live on.”

“Yes,” Todd said. “And there 
ought to be some use tor his body. 
To scare away animals, something. 
No, I feel we might as well be 
honest about it. You don’t mind, do 
you, Lewis?” 

“As long as you wait,” said Cath- 
cart. “In about three weeks I expect 
not to mind. Just don’t do anything 
with me or talk about it until then, 
okay?” 

X>ut he died much sooner than that 
xy — less than a day after the ship 
brought them down on to a long open 
slope, between dark green tangles 
of growth and a freeform lake with 
mountains on its far side. The others 
were fidgeting around in front of the 
ship — or what was left of it, the 
core which had been constructed to 
pass through a planet’s atmosphere 
— wondering what to do, and Cath- 
cart lay with his head and shoulders 
propped against a rock, perhaps fif- 
teen meters away, over by a bend in 
the river that wound down to the 
lake, when something big came 
sprawling around the end of the ship. 
Then his shout got mixed with a 
scabrous body and flapping and a 
nasty smell, and the thing was going 
from them awkwardly, hopping and 
lurching and fluttering its bony 
wings. 

Ronaldson had taken two steps 
toward it, but now he came back 
and stood with them, combing back 
his hair with rigid fingers, close to 
the ship. The thing crouched on the 
lakeshore and ate Cathcart, twisting 
about a lot. It had a narrow buck- 
toothed head with lidless round eyes 
set at the sides and a long scaly 



ridged neck. Its wings were obviously 
too small to fly with and now, fold- 
ed, they stuck out crisscross in 
pointed folds over its back. There 
was a thick moving tail, and as the 
beast crouched the hind legs hunch- 
ed up fatly against its belly. Its fore- 
legs were long and slender and ended 
in enormous three-fingered claws 
and these pushed Cathcart about 
frantically under the writhing of its 
head and neck. 

“A real monster, that,” Ronaldson 
said. 

“What, do you suppose it’s doing 
to him?” Sherril said eventually. 

“Spitting him out and washing 
him, I think,” said Todd. “I gather it 
doesn’t much like the taste.” 

“Perhaps it’ll leave the rest of us 
alone, then?” 

Still, they spent the rest of that 
day very close to the ship and went 
inside when the lake turned black. 

Next morning they found the 
monster dead, wings projecting 
straight up, almost at their door. Its 
eyes had turned an ugly yellow. Todd 
walked all the way around it and 
then said: “So he ^d do something 
else for us after all.” 

“I should have thought of this,” 
said Sherril. “Of course it hadn’t a 
chance of digesting Lewis — an 
alien lifeform. Too many differences 
in molecular structure.” 

“But we’ve got to eat too,” Jane 
Shaw said. “If this thing — ” 

“Yes, but you’ve got a Nagel 
stomach, you know,” Sherril told her. 
“Digests practically anything. At 
least any carbon-based life. Which 
all this is.” And she waved her hand 
about.

“When did that happen?” Ronald- 
son said. “A stomach? I don’t remem- 
ber anybody doing that to me.” 
“Had to. They wouldn’t have let 
you off Earth otherwise. The differ- 
ences in what you’d eat on Smith’s 
World are probably as great as here. 
Greater maybe.” 

“Let’s not talk about Smith’s 
World,” Ronaldson said. “I’m trying 
to forget.” 

T 'odd worked most of the morning 
at separating one of the wing 
bones from the corpse and failed. 
He had nothing to cut with except 
splinters of rock. Nothing in the ship 
was even like a tool, much less a 
weapon. There were no points and 
no sharp edges, and most things 
were molded into the walls. 

His idea had been to make a spear 
or a bow out of the bone — a bow 
was a primitive machine, without 
brains, that could be used to project 
sharp sticks — but rocks only 
scratched the small hard scales of 
the wing, and by midday he was 
breathing openmouthed and his fin- 
gers no longer held on to things, and 
he could do no more. 

“We’ll have to do something else 
for protection,” he said, staggering 
back into the ship. “Dig pits.” 

“With your hands, I suppose,” 
Sherril said, and he looked at wl^t 
had happened to his palms and fin- 
gers. But that afternoon birds — as 
Ronaldson, who was naming things, 
decided to call them in spite of their 
lack of feathers — began to light on 
the body, longlegged metallic-green 
creatures with rounded heads that 
screwed into the folds of skin and 



jerked away. A standard week later 
the bones of the dragon were bare. 

B y then they were constructing a 
house. The ship had become un- 
livable the third day — tiny crawling 
things had got inside and eaten* boles 
in the refrigerator plates, and the 
ship’s brains, including the doctor, 
died. The kitchen stopped preparing 
meals. Closed doors no longer 
opened. The air turned foul, and 
fluid of some sort began to collect 
in the room where Ronaldson and 
Jane Shaw were sleeping. So they 
had to move outside, and well away 
from the ship because of the 
stench of the dragon. 

They had almost a kilometer of 
flexible tubing, seventeen transparent 
bags, an empty brandy bottle, three 
spools of chartreuse tape with a 
black stripe along the top edge, the 
lens off a microfilm reader, thirty- 
two boxes that wouldn’t open and 
four legless chairs — these things 
were what they could salvage from 
the ship. But they had nothing that 
could be used to cut down trees or 
dig holes in the ground. And in any 
case the ground was rocky. To make 
a reasonably deep hole in it they 
would have needed some sort of ex- 
plosive; and the trees were made of 
layer after layer of rough fiber that 
would have spread and bent under 
the weight of a roof. 

So while Todd kept watch beside 
his pile of throwing-stones, the 
others gathered branches and under- 
brush for a geodesic. The most com- 
plicated problems with that sort of 
house were mathematical, and all of 
them still knew how to do elemen-

tary trig. It took just four days to 
lash together and cover a dome that 
measured roughly seven meters 
across — big enough, everybody 
hoped, to keep out a second dragon. 
But the earleaf and mud did little 
to keep out the rain which began to 
fall that evening, and kept on late 
into the night. 

uTn the morning we must dig all 
A the way around and make a 
channel so some of the water will 
run off.” Jane Shaw said suddenly 
in the dark. 

“Must we?” said Sherril. “I’m ly- 
ing in a puddle too, at least most of 
me is. But it’s a comfortable puddle. 
Warm and soothing. Why can’t we 
just live with it?” 

“Don’t count on its always being 
warm.” 

“We’ve got tools now,” Todd said. 
“I think maybe I can rig up some 
kind of spade from the vertebrae.” 
“What’s a spade?” asked Ronald- 
son. 

“It’s a thing for digging with,” 
Todd told him. “So we can do this 
all-day job of Jane’s in maybe a 
couple of hours.” 

“Maybe.” 

“My hands won’t close now,” 
Sherril said. “They’re getting thick 
on the inside and they always hurt. 
Couldn’t we just rest for a while?” 
“Symptoms of the primitive life,” 
Ronaldson said. “The hands, I mean. 
Hardly the resting.” He gave a long 
noisy sigh. 

“I’ve had an idea,” Todd said. “If 
we filled in the river — that would 
just mean throwing in lots of rocks, 
it wouldn’t be hard — then I think 



the way the ground slopes, the water 
would have to go around on the 
other side of the ship. We would 
be here in the middle, on a sort of 
triangle of ground with water around 
and that might be good protection 
against dragons.” 

“Hop right over,” said Ronaldson. 

“Maybe there aren’t any more 
dragons,” Sherril said. 

Ronaldson splashed about, came 
back. 

“It might be stopping. Who 
knows?” 

“Watch out, you’re trying to sit 
on me,” Jane Shaw said. 

“What happens to where the river 
used to be?” Sherril asked. “When 
you fill it in? There won’t be any 
water there, will there, Todd?” 

“I didn’t think about that,” he 
said finally. “Well, if we dig a chan- 
nel and divert only part of the river, 
that ought to work.” 

“I suppose that just means I’ve 
made an even bigger job out of it.” 

“I’ll bet there’s a way to get food 
out of the river too, when we get 
to work on it. Sooner or later we’re 
going to run out of animals that’ll 
stand still while we throw rocks at 
them.” 

“You know,” she said, sitting up 
— the water trickled off her louder, 
briefly, then the sound of rain out- 
side — “that’s worth thinking about. 
There are bound to be things in the 
river. Environments fill up, and the 
more different stuff we eat the bet- 
ter.” 

“We need to store a few things 
away too,” Jane Shaw said. “Out in 
natural environments there are win- 
ters. The air gets cold, and it’s sup-

posed to be harder to find food.” 
The rain paused, then scattered a 
long last gust and was gone, and 
they were left with the ticking of 
drops inside the dome. 

“We’re getting an edge on things 
now,” Ronaldson said. “If you don’t 
think about how meaningless it all is. 
But we’re alive. We’ve got shelter, 
sort of, and the dragon’s going to 
make a fair supply of things to cut 
and dig with, spades, tools.” 

“The things we’ve absolutely got 
to have,” Todd said. 

“And we can even start thinking 
about the future. We’re actually 
making it.” 

“You know what made all the dif- 
ference, don’t you?” Sherril said. “It 
was the dragon’s eating Lewis. We’ve 
got a lot to thank Lewis for.” She 
lay back down, crooked her head 
over out of a puddle. 

“We ought to think about light 
and heat,” said Jane Shaw. 

A nd then Jane Shaw was dead. 

She didn’t get up in the morning, 
and Sherril called her twice and 
went over to shake her awake be- 
fore noticing her eyes were open 
and their surfaces dry, faintly puck- 
ered. They stripped off the tattered 
freezer coverall, but there were no 
unexpected marks on her body. She 
was simply dead. Todd rolled her 
back over, and she lay with her eyes, 
if that was the thing to call them 
now, fixed on the center of the 
dome. 

“It’s like suddenly finding a hole 
in the world,” Ronaldson said. “As 
if it. wasn’t real the way you’d al- 
ways thought it was.” 



Todd moved her jaw up and down 
slowly. 

“\^at are you doing, trying to 
make a poem out of it?” 

“But what happened to her?” 
Sherril said. “Surely people don’t 
just die^ 

“Well, in a way I’ve been expect- 
ing something like this,” said Todd. 
“I’ve thought about it a lot. Of 
course without a doctor we’ll never 
know why Jane died, but it was al- 
most predictable. How much stuff 
were you taking back on Earth, 
Dick? How many pills a week, for 
example?” 

“Seventeen, eighteen. I never 
knew what they were for.” 

“Sherril?” 

“Three. You mean she had some 
organic defect, don’t you? Her body 
couldn’t assimilate something it need- 
ed or get rid of its own poisons with- 
out help? I suppose I ought to have 
thought of that.” 

“I can’t know, of course. But isn’t 
it likely? Aren’t there a lot of people 
like that? Obviously all the stuff I 
and everybody I ever knew took 
was supposed to do something. 

“It’s because there are so many 
laws about modifying human em- 
bryos,” Sherril said. “I’ve got — I 
had friends who used to gripe about 
it. You couldn’t always change some- 
thing even if you knew it was wrong. 
Not that you can always detect 
things in the embryo, for that mat- 
ter. I suppose most human beings 
have something seriously wrong with 
them — but you can’t discriminate 
against their genes, you know. That’s 
illegal too. Of course it doesn’t mat- 
ter ordinarily.”

IF 




“So there’s something wrong with 
us,” Ronaldson said. “Only we don’t 
know what Surprise! Maybe my head 
falls off.” 

“I know one thing that’s likely to 
be wrong,” said Todd. “At least part 
of the stuff all of us took was an 
I.E. An intelligence enhancer. Hu- 
man beings aren’t naturally intelli- 
gent enough to deal with the kind of 
civilization they’ve got.” 

“Naturally they’re what you’d 
even call stupid, I suppose,” Sherril 
said. “When did the I.E.’s come in? 
1970 ? 1980 ?” 

“I don’t remember exactly,” Todd 
said. “But I do know before that 
the race was degenerating fast. I’ve 
taught history. In the countries that 
did any testing, England, America, 
there was a loss of as much as three 
I.Q. points a decade. Of course, I 
expect those weren’t accurate tests.” 

“And the stupid ones would be the 
ones who had children,” Sherril said. 
“Maybe it isn’t a very clever thing 
to do, either.” 

“So really I may be feeble-mind- 
ed,” Ronaldson said, looking at 
Jane’s eyes again. 

“I just hope it’s nothing worse,” 
Todd said, and pointed, waved his 
finger at the corpse. “She’s dead.” 

“Different chemicals stay in your 
body different lengths of time,” 
Sherril said. “And we may have been 
taking pills for things that don’t mat- 
ter out here.” 

B ut Todd and Ronaldson never 
did. That afternoon the second 
dragon came out of the forest and 
had them trapped down by the lake 
where they were taking Jane’s head. 



wrapped in a net of plastic tubing, 
to see if it could be used to catch 
something worth eating. Sherril had 
just time to scream, and when they 
turned it was a hundred meters 
away, between them and the dome. 

Todd went into the lake. Then 
Sherril found she was still screaming 
and stopped. The dragon shrieked. 
Looking back then, she saw that 
Todd had got the net over its head. 

She crawled to the door but still 
couldn’t see him. He was not turning 
toward her across the open, ' or 
crouched behind a rock. 

By late afternoon the dragon had 
writhed into deep enough water to 
drown. 

The next morning, when she could 
no longer stand to wait, she went 
down to the lake and found Todd 
where the dragon had rolled on him, 
smashed almost flat. 

Sherril lasted a long while. She 
moved back into the ship — the 
smell had weakened, and in any case 
she wasn’t bothered as much by 
smells now — and started a garden 
of the more edible plants. She had 
always been good at killing things 
with rocks, and by the first snow she 
had managed to fill the interior of 
the ship with rotting food. But by 
then she was very stupid, too, and 
one day she got caught at the end 
of a corridor and could not think to 
turn around, and so starved to death 
facing the closed door to the obser- 
vatory. She was at that time about 
six standard months pregnant, and 
the male child inside her more or 
less well formed. 

If it had been born it might have 
survived as long as a week. END

one human in if was almost impossible — 
but the human was the woman he loved!

I t wasn’t a luxury cruise. The man 
Ancu-Uriru had assigned to cap- 
tain the tub — In-Ruhic, by name 
— believed in every man’s work- 
ing his way, in spite of the gen- 
erous fare I’d paid. Even aboard 
as sophisticated a machine as a 
spaceship, there was plenty of coolie 
labor, as I well rememibered from 



my apprenticeship under Sir Or- 
feo. The standards he’d taught me 
carried over here. After my assign- 
ed chores were done I spent long 
hours chipping and scraping and 
cleaning and polishing, trying sin- 
gle-<handed to dear away grime 
that had been accumulating since 
the days of the Vikings — or long-

old ship had been built on a world

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



Earth is my home. But I haven't seen it now since I was a 
schoolboy, and I don't know when I'll ever see it again. 

The people from space visit earth when they want to, and 
no one is ever the wiser. Maybe you've seen them yourself and never 
known. I was not that lucky. When I stumbled on a party of them, 
two men and a lovely young girl, they gave themselves away — 
and so they took me with them when they left. 

So I stayed with them, pleasure-cruising across the galaxy 
hunting wild beast as their gun-bearer, until they met a beast more 
dangerous than themselves. died. The girl and I survived, 

until slavers came and took her from me. 

The next ship I saw took me — pursuing those who had stolen 
the only thing in the universe I loved. 



called Urhaz, an unknown number 
of millenia ago. 

At first my wounds caused me a 
lot of pain, until In-Ruhic stopped 
me one day and told me my groans 
were interfering with his inward 
peace. He had me stretch out on a 
table while he rubbed some vile- 
smelling grease into the scars. 

“How you survived, untended, is 
a matter of wonder,”, he said. “I 
think you lost a pound of flesh and 
bone here, where the pellet tore 
through your shoulder. And you’ve 
broken ribs, healed crookedly. And 
your throat! Man, under the web of 
scar-tissue, I can see the pulse in 
the great vein each time you lift 
your chinl” 

But his hands were truly as 
gentle as any girl’s could have been. 
He gave me a treatment every day

for a few weeks. The glop he used 
must have had some healing effect 
because the skin toughened up over 
the scars and the pain gradually 
faded. 

I told In-Ruhic and the others 
about the wasp-waisted ship and 
the armored midgets that had tak- 
en the Lady Raire; but they’d nev- 
er seen or heard of their kind. They 
wagged their heads and grunted in 
vicarious admiration when I de- 
scribed her to them. 

“But these are matters best for- 
gotten, Biridanju.” That was as 
close as In-Ruhic seemed to be able 
to get to my name. “I’ve heard of 
the world called Zeridajh. Distant 
it is, and inhabited by men as rich 
as emperors. Doubtless these evil- 
doers you tell of have long since 
sold her there for ransom. 

95 




B y the time the world where An- 
cu-Uriru planned to drop me 
was visible in the view-screen on 
the bridge where I was pulling 
watches as a sort of assistant in- 
strument reader, I was almost a 
full-fledged member of the crew. 
Just before we started our landing 
maneuvers, which were more com- 
plicated for an old tub like In- 
Ruhic’s command than they had 
been for Lord Desory’s ultramod- 
ern yacht, In-Ruhic took me aside 
and asked me what my plans were. 

“If there’s a Zeridajhi embassy. 
I’ll go there and tell them about 
the Lady Raire. Or maybe I can 
send some kind of message through. 
If not . well, ni figure out some- 
thing.” 

He shook his head and looked 
sad and wise. “You nurture a hope- 
less passion for this high-born lady,” 
he stated. 

“Nothing like that,” I cut him 
off short. “She was in my care. 
I’m responsible.” 

He put a hand on my shoulder. 
“Biridanju, you’ve shown yourself 
a willing worker, and quick to learn. 
Stay on with me. I offer you a reg- 
ular berth aboard this vessel.” 
“Thanks, In-Ruhic. But I have 
another job to do.” 

“Think well, Biridanju. For a 
foreigner work is not easy to find. 
And to shore folk, who know not 
the cruel ways of space, your little 
decorations may prove unsightly, 
an added incubus.” 

I put a hand up and felt the 
lumps and ridges along the side of 
my throat and jaw. “I know. It 
looks like hell. But I’m not asking 



for any beauty prizes. I’ll pay my 
way.” 

“I suppose you must make your 
try. But after, Biridanju, remem- 
ber. We’re based nearby and call 
here at Inciro ever and anon. I’ll 
welcome you as shipmate whenev- 
er you’re ready.” 

W e landed a few hours later on 
a wind-swept ramp between 
a gray sea and a town growing on 
a hillside. Captain Ancu-Uriru was 
there ahead of us. He talked earnest- 
ly with In-Ruhic for a while, then 
invited me to his quarters aboard 
the yacht. There he sat me down 
and offered me a drink and a dou- 
ble-barreled cigar, rolled from two 
different weeds which, when com- 
bined, produced a smoke worse than 
any three nickel stogies. 

“Biridanju, I tell you freely, 
you’ve made me a rich man,” he 
said. “I thought at first you were 
a shill who’d bring pirates down on 
me. Almost, I had you shot be- 
fore you boarded.” He made a face 
that might have been a smile. 
“Your cat saved you. It passed rea- 
son that a man with your wounds, 
and an animal lover, could be but 
a decoy for corsair. I ordered In- 
Ruhic to watch you closely, and 
for long I slept but little, watching 
these beautiful screens for signs of 
mischief. Now I know I did you 
an injury.” 

“You saved my life,” I said. 
“No apologies needed.” 

He lifted a flat box from a draw- 
er of the gorgeous inlaid desk. “I 
am a just man, Biridanju; or so I 
hope. I sold the special store aboard

this cutter for a sum greater than 
any year’s profit I’ve known since 
I first captained a trader. The pro- 
ceeds are here, your fair share.” 

1 lifted the lid and looked at an 
array of little colored sticks an 
eighth of an inch square and an 
inch long. 

“There is enough there to keep 
you in comfort for many years,” 
he said, “if you squander it not on 
follies, such as star-messages or pas- 
senger fares. Not that there’s 
enough to take you far.” He gave 
me a sharp look that meant In- 
Ruhic had told him my plans. 

I thanked him and assured him 
I’d make it go as far as I could. 

It took me ten minutes to col- 
lect my personal belongings from 
the ship and buckle Eureka into the 
harness I’d made for him. Then 
Ancu-Uriru took me through the 
port formalities, which weren’t 
much for anyone with a bankroll, 
and found me an inn in the town. 
In-Ruhic joined us for a final drink 
in my room, and then they left, and 
I sat on the side of the plain little 
bunk in the plain little room in the 
yellow twilight and scratched Eure- 
ka behind the ears and felt the 
loneliness close in. 

XII 

T he town was named Inciro, like 
the planet. It was one of half 
a dozen ports that had been built 
ages past to handle the long van- 
ished trade in minerals and hides 
and timber from the interior of the 
one big continent. 

The population added up to about 
SPACEMAN! 



ten thousand people, many of whom 
had six fingers on each hand for 
some reason. They were tall, dark- 
eyed, pale-skinned, gloomy-looking, 
with a sort of Black Irish family 
resemblance, like Eskimos or Hot- 
tentots. I spent a few days wander- 
ing around the town, sampling the 
food in different chophouses and 
seafood dives — they were all good 
— and drinking a tasty red beer 
called izm. The mixed dialect I’d 
learned from In-Ruhic and his men 
was good enough to carry on a ba- 
sic conversation. I soon learned 
there was no Zeridajhi embassy 
anywhere on the planet. The near- 
est thing to it was a consular agent 
representing the commercial inter- 
est of the half dozen worlds within 
five light-years of Inciro. 

I called on him. He was a fattish, 
hairy man in a stale-smelling office 
over a warehouse. He steepled his 
pudgy fingers and listened to what 
I had to say, then solemnly suggest- 
ed I forget the whole thing. It 
seemed it was a big galaxy, and the 
things that had maimed me and 
stolen Milady Raire could be any- 
where in it — probably at the far 
side of it by now. No belligerent 
non-human had been seen in these 
parts for more centuries than I had 
years. He would have liked to have 
told me I’d imagined it all, but his 
eyes kept straying back to my scars. 

Eureka went with me on my 
walks, attracting quite a bit of at- 
tention at first. TTie Inctrinos had 
seen cats before, but none W size. 
He did more than keep me com- 
pany. One evening a trio of lough- 
nec^ with too many bowls of izm

inside them came over to get a 
closer look at my scars, and he 
came to his feet from where he’d 
been curled up under the table and 
made a sound like tearing canvas 
and showed a mouthful of teeth, 
and they backed away fast. 

I found a little old man who hung 
around one of the bars who 
knew half a dozen useful dialects. 
For the price of enough drinks each 
evening to keep him in a talking 
mood, he gave me language lessons, 
plus the beginning of an education 
on the state of this end of the gal- 
axy. He told me how the human 
race had developed a long time 
ago on a world near Galactic Cen- 
ter, had spread outwards in all di- 
rections for what must have been a 
couple of hundred thousand years, 
settled every habitable planet they 
found and built a giant empire that 
collapsed peacefully after a while of 
its own weight. That had been over 
twenty thousand years earlier; and 
since then the many separate tribes 
of man had gone their own ways. 

“Now, take you.” He poked a 
skinny finger at me. “From a plan- 
et you call Eart’. Thought you were 
the only people in the Universe. But 
all you were was a passed-over col- 
ony, or maybe what was left of a 
party marooned by an accident; or 
a downed battleship. Or maybe you 
were a penal colony. Or perhaps a 
few people wandered out there, two 
thirds of the way to the rim, just 
wanting to be alone. A few thou- 
sand years pass, and — there you 
are!” He looked triumphant, as if 
he’d just delivered a rigorous proof 
SPACEMANI 



of the trisection of the angle. 

“But we’ve dug up bones,” I 
told him. “Ape-men, and missing 
links. They show practically the 
whole chain of evolution, from an- 
imals to men. And we’ve got goril- 
las and chimps and monkeys that 
look too much like us to just be 
coincidence.” 

“Who said anything about coinci- 
dence?” he came back. “Life adapts 
to conditions. Similar conditions, 
similar life. You ever look at the 
legs and feet on a pink-lizard? 
Swear they were human, except 
they’re only so long. Look at flying 
creatures: birds, mammals,, rep- 

tiles, goranos or mikls. They all 
have wings, all flap ’em, all have 
hollow bones, use two legs for 
walking — ” 

“Even Eureka is related to hu- 
manity,” I pressed on. “We have 
more similarities than we have dif- 
ferences. As embryos of a few 
weeks, you can’t tell us apart.” 

He nodded and grinned. “Uh- 
huh. And where’d you say you got 
him. Not on Eart’.” 

It was like arguing religion. Talk- 
ing about it just confirmed every- 
one in his original opinion. But the 
talking was good experience. By the 
time I’d been on Inciro for three 
months Earth time 1 was fluent in 
the lingua franca that the spacers 
used and had a pretty good work- 
ing vocabulary in a couple of other 
dialects. And kept my Zeridajh 
sharpened up with long imaginary 
conversations with the Lady Raire, 
in which I explained over and over 
again how we should have greeted 
the midgets. 

99 




I looked up a local surgeon who 
examined my wounds and clucked 
and, after a lot of lab studies and al- 
lergy tests, put me under an anes- 
thetic and rebuilt my shoulder with 
metal and plastic to replace what 
was missing. When the synthetic 
skin had stitched itself in with the 
surrounding hide, he operated 
again, to straighten out my ribs. 
He wanted to reupholster the side 
of my neck and jaw next, but the 
synthetic hide was the same pale 
color as the locals; it wouldn’t have 
improved my looks much. And by 
then, I was tired of the pain and 
boredom of plastic surgery. My arm 
worked all right now, and I could 
stand up straight again instead of 
cradling my smashed side. And it 
was time to move on. 

In-Ruhic’s ship called about then, 
and I asked his advice. 

“I don’t want to sign on for just 
a local run,” I told him. “I want to 
work my way toward Zeridajh and 
ask questions along the way. Sooner 
or later I’ll find a lead to the Mid- 
gets.” 

“This is a long quest you set 
yourself, Biridanju,” he said. “And 
a vain one.” But he took me along 
to a local ship-owner and got me a 
place as an apprentice power-sec- 
tion trader on a freighter bound in- 
ward toward a world called Topaz. 

XIII 

E ureka and I saw Topaz, and af- 
ter that Greu and Poylon and 
Trie and Pandache’s World and the 
Three Moons. Along the way, I 
learned the ins and outs of an ion- 
100 



pulse drive and a stressed-field gen- 
erator; and I served my time in 
vac suits, working outside under the 
big black sky that wrapped all the 
way around and seemed to pull at 
me like a magnet that would suck 
me away into its deepest blackest 
depths, every hour I spent out on 
a hull. 

And I had my head pounded by 
a few forecastle strong-arm types, 
until an oak-tough old tubeman 
who’d almost been fleet champion 
once in his homeworld’s navy show- 
ed me a few simple tricks to keep 
from winding up on the short end 
of every bout. His naethod was ef- 
fective. He pounded me harder than 
the bully-boys until I got fast 
enough to bloody his nose one night, 
and graduated. 

I learned to pull duty three on, 
three off, to drink the concoctions 
that space-faring men seemed to al- 
ways be able to produce no matter 
how far they were from the last 
port, and to play seventy-one dif- 
ferent games with hundred-and-four 
card decks whose history was lost 
in antiquity. And at every world I 
asked and got the same answer. 
No such animals as the Midgets had 
been seen in five thousand years 
and probably not then. 

On a world called Unriss, in a 
library that was a museum relic it- 
self, I found a picture of a Midget 
— or a reasonable facsimile. I 
couldn’t read the text, but the li- 
brarian could make out a little of 
the old language. It said the thing 
was called a Heeaq, that it was a 
denizen of a world of the same 
name, and that it was extinct. 

IF 




Where Heeaq was located, it neg- 
lected to say. 

My small bankroll, which would 
have kept me in modest circum- 
stances on Enciro, didn’t last long. 
I spent it carefully, item by item 
outfitted my ship chest, including 
a few luxuries like a dreamer and 
a supply of tapes, a good power 
gun and shore clothes. I studied as- 
trogation and power section main- 
tenance whenever I was able to get 
hold of a tape I hadn’t seen before. 
By the time two years had passed, 
I had been promoted to power chief, 
second class, meaning I was quali- 
fied to act as standby chief on ves- 
sels big enough to have a standby 
complement. That was a big step 
forward — like jumping from Chi- 
nese junks to tramp steamers. It 
meant I could ship on bigger, faster 
vessels, with longer range. 

I reached a world called Lhiza, 
after a six-month cruise on a con- 
verted battle cruiser, and spent 
three months on the beach there, 
spending my back pay on new 
training tapes and looking for a 
berth that would take me into 
the edge of the sector of the gal- 
axy known as the Bar. 

It wasn’t easy. Few of the older, 
slower hulls that worked the East- 
ern Arm had business there. But the 
Bar was where Zeridajh was, still 
thousands of light-years away, but 
getting closer. 

T 'he vessel I finally shipped on 
was a passenger liner, operating 
under a contract with the govern- 
ment of a world called Ahax, haul- 
ing immigrant labor. I didn’t much 
SPACEMANI 



like the idea; it was my first time 
nurse-maiding a ship-load of Flat- 
landers. But I was offered a slot as 
first powerman, and the tub was 
going on a long way, and in the 
right direction. So I signed on. 

She was an old ship, like most 
of the hulls operating in the Arm, 
but she had been a luxury job in 
her day. I had a suite to myself, 
with room for Eureka, so for the 
first time aboard ship the old cat 
got to sleep across my feet, the way 
he did ashore. The power section 
was a massive, old-fashioned stress- 
ed-field installation; but after the 
first few weeks of shakedown and 
impressing my ideas on my crew 
I had the engines running smooth- 
ly. Everything settled down then to 
the quiet, slightly dull, sometimes 
pleasant, always monotonous rou- 
tine that all long cruises are. 

My first shift chief, Ommu, was 
a big^uscled, square-faced fellow 
with the faint greenish cast to his 
skin that said he was from a high 
Cl world. He listened to my story 
of the Midgets and told me that 
once, many years before, he’d seen 
a similar ship, copper-colored. 
It had drifted into a commen- 
tary^ orbit around a world in the 
Guree system, in the Bar. She 
was a navigational hazard, and he’d 
been one of the crew assigned to 
rendezvous with her and set vapor- 
orizing charges. Against standing 
orders, he and another sapper had 
crawled in through a hole in her 
side to take a look around. The ship 
had been long dead, and there 
wasn’t much left of the crew; but 
he had picked up a souvenir. He 

101 




got it from his ship-chest and laid 
it on the mess table in front of me: 
It looked like a stack of demitasse 
cu]>s^ dull silver, with a loop at the 
base and a short rod projecting 
from the open end. 

“Yeah,” I said, and felt my scalp 
prickle, just looking at it. It wasn’t 
identical with the guns that had 
shot me up, back on Gar 28, but it 
was a close enough relative. 

I had him tell me all about the 
ship, everything he could remem- 
ber. There wasn’t much. We went 
up to the ship’s psychologist and 
after a lot of persuasion and a bot- 
tle of crude stuff from the power 
section still, he agreed to run a re- 
call on Ommu under hypnosis. I 
checked with the purser and located 
a xenologist among the passengers 
and got Mm to sit in on the session. 

In a light trance, Ommu relived 
the approach to the ship, described 
it in detail as he came up on it from 
sun-«idc. We followed him inside, 
through the maze of compartments, 
we were with him as he stirred the 
remains of what must have been a 
Heeaq and turned up the gun. 

The therapist ran Mm back 
through it three times, and he and 
the xenologist took ttims firing 
questions at him. At the end of two 
hours, Ommu ^as soaking wet, and 
I had the spooky feeling I’d been 
aboard that derelict with him. 

T he xenologist wanted to go back 
to his quarters and pore over 
his findings, but I talked Mm into 
giving us a spot analysis of what 
he’d gotten. 

“The vessel itself appears a typi- 
102 



cal artifact of what we call the 
H’eeaq Group,” he said. “They are 
an echinodermoid form, originating 
far out in fringe space, or, as some 
have theorized, representing an in- 
cursion from a neighboring stellar 
assemblage, presumably the Lesser 
Cloud. Their few fully documented 
contacts with Man, and with other 
advanced races of the galaxy, re- 
veal a cultural pattern of marked 
schizoid-accretional character — ” 

“Maybe you could make that a lit- 
tle plainer,” Ommu suggested. 

“These are traits reflecting a ba- 
sic disintegration of the societal 
mechanism,” he told us and elabo- 
rated on that for a while. The 
simplified explanation was as bad 
as the regular one, as far as my 
vocabulary was concerned. I told 
him so. 

“Look here,” he snapped. He 
was a peppery little man. “You’re 
asking me to extrapolate from very 
scanty data, to place my profession- 
al reputation in jeopardy — “ 

“NotMng like that, sir,” I 
soothed him. “I’d just like to have 
a little edge the next time I meet 
those types.” 

“Ummm. There’s their basic in- 
security, of course. I’d judge their 
home world has been cataclysmic- 
ally destroyed, probably the bulk 
of their race along with it. What 
this might do to a species with a 
strong racial-survival drive is any- 
one’s guess. If I were you, I’d look 
for a complex phobia system. Fear 
of heights or enclosed spaces, as- 
sorted fetish symbologies. And of 
course, the bully syndrome. Con- 
vince them you’re stronger, and 

IF 




they’re your slaves. Weaker, and 
they destroy you.” 

That was all I got from him. 
Ommu gave me the teacup gun. I 
disassembled it and examined its 
workings, but it didn’t tell me much. 
The routine closed in again then. 
I fine-tuned the generators and 
put the crew on polishing until the 
section gleamed from one end to 
the other. I won some money play- 
ing tikal, lost is again at revo. 

And then one off-shift I was 
shocked up out of a deep sleep to 
find myself lying on the floor, with 
Eureka yowling over me and every 
alarm bell on the ship screaming 
disaster. 

B y the time I reached the power 
section, the buffeting was so 
bad that I had to grab a rail to 
stay on my feet. 

“I’ve tried to get through to com- 
mand for orders,” Ommu yelled 
over the racket, “but no contact!” 
I tried the inter-deck screen, 
raised a young plotman with blood 
on his face w^ho told me the whole 
forward end of the ship had been 
carried away by a collision, with 
what he didn’t know. That was all 
he told me before the screen 
blanked in the middle of a word. 

A new shock knocked both of us 
down. The deck heaved up under 
us and kept going, right on up and 
over. 

“She’s tumbling,” I yelled to 
Ommu. “She’ll break up fast un- 
der this! Order the men to lifeboat 
stations!” A tubeman named Rusi 
showed up then, pale as chalk, 
hugging internal injuries. I gave 
SPACEMANI 



him a hand, and we crawled on 
floors, walls and ceilings, made it 
to our boat station. The bay door 
was blown wide, and the boat was 
hanging in its davits with the stem 
torn out and there were pieces of 
a dead man scattered around. I 
ordered the men up to the next 
station and started to help my 
walking wounded, but he was al- 
ready dead. 

The upper bay was chaos. I grab- 
bed a gun from a lanky grandpa 
who was waving it and yelling and 
fired over the crowd. Nobody no- 
ticed. Ommu joined me, and with 
a few crewmen we formed up a 
flying wedge. Ommu got the hatch 
open while the rest of us beat back 
the mob. All this time. Eureka had 
stayed close to me, with his ears 
flattened and his tail twitching. 

“Take ’em in order,” I told 
Ommu. “Anybody tries to walk 
over somebody else. I’ll shoot him!” 
Two seconds later I had to make 
that good when a beefy two hun- 
dred pounder charged me. I blew 
a hole through him, and the rest of 
them scattered back. 

The boat had been designed for 
fifty passengers; we had eighty- 
seven aboard when a wall of fire 
came rolling down the corridor and 
Ommu grabbed me just in time and 
hauled me in across the laps of a 
fat woman and a middle-aged man 
who was crying, and Eureka bound- 
ed in past me. I got forward and 
threw in the big red lever and a big 
boot kicked us and then there was 
the sick, null-G feel that meant 
we’d cleared the launch tube and 
were on our own. 

103 




XIV 

I n the 2-by-4 command compart- 
ment, I watched the small screen 
where five miles away the ship was 
rotating slowly, end-over-end, with 
debris trailing off from her in a 
lazy spiral. Flashes of light spar- 
kled at points along the hull where 
smashed piping was spewing explo- 
sive mixtures. Her back was broken 
and the aft third of the ship sep- 
arated and a cloud of tiny objects, 
some of them human, scattered out 
into the void, exploding as they hit 
vacuum. The center section blew 
then. When the smoke cleared 
there was nothing left but a major 
fragment of the stern, glowing red- 
hot, and an expanding dust-cloud. 

“Any other boats get away?” I 
asked. 

“I didn’t see any, Billy.” 

“There were five thousand peo- 
ple aboard that scowl We can’t be 
the only survivors!” I yelled at him, 
as if convincing him would make 
it true. 

A powerman named Lath stuck 
his head in. “We’ve got some casu- 
alties back here,” he said. “Where 
in the Nine Hells are we, anyway?” 
I checked the chart screen. The 
nearest world was a planet named 
Cyoc, blue-coded, which meant un- 
inhabited and uninhabitable. 

“Nothing there but a beacon,” 
Ommu said. “An ice world.” 

We checked; found nothing 
within a year’s range that was any 
better — or as good. 

“Cyoc it is,” I said. “Now let’s 
take a look at what we’ve got to 
work with.” 

104 



I led the way down the no-G cen- 
tral tube past the passenger cells 
that were arranged radially around 
it, like the kernels on a com cob. 
They were badly overcrowded. 
There seemed to be a lot of wom- 
en and children. Maybe the mob 
had demonstrated some of the chiv- 
alric instincts, after all; or maybe 
Ommu had done some selecting I 
didn’t notice. I wasn’t sure he’d 
done the right thing. 

A big man, wearing what had 
been expensive clothes before the 
mob got them, pushed out in the 
aisle up ahead of me, waited for 
me to come to him. 

“I’m Till Ognath, member of the 
Ahacian Assembly,” he stated. “As 
highest ranking individual aboard. 
I’m assuming command. I see you’re 
Crew. I want you men to run a 
scan of the nearby volume of space 
and give me a choice of five possi- 
ble destinations within our cruise 
capability. Then — ” 

“This is Chief Danger, Power 
Section.” Ommu butted into his 
spiel. “He’s ranking Crew.” 

Assemblyman Ognath looked me 
over. “Better give me the gun. He 
held out a broad, well-tended hand. 

“I’ll keep it,” I said. “I’ll be glad 
to have your help, Assemblyman.” 
“Maybe I didn’t make myself 
clear,” Ognath showed me a well- 
bred frown. “As a member of the 
World Assembly of Ahax, I — ” 
“Ranking crew member assumes 
command. Assemblyman,” Ommu 
cut him off. “Better crawl back in 
your hole. Mister, before you qual- 
ify yourself for proceedings under 
space law.” 



IF 




“You'd quote law to me, 
you — ” Ognath*s vocabulary failed 
him. 

“I’ll let you know how you can 
best be of service, Assemblyman,” 
I told him, and we moved on and 
left him still looking for a suitable 
word. 

T ^he boat was in good shape, fully 
equipped and supplied — for 
fifty people, all of who-m were pre- 
sumed to have had plenty of time to 
pack and file aboard like ladies and 
gentlemen. Assemblyman Ognath 
made a formal complaint about the 
presence of an animal aboard, but 
he was howled down. Everybody 
seemed to think a mascot was lucky. 
Anyway, Eureka ate very little and 
took up no useful space. Two of 
the injured died the first day, three 
more in the next week. We put 
them out the lock and closed ranks. 

There wasn’t much room for 
modesty aboard, for those with 
strong feelings about such matters. 
One man objected to another’s 
watching his wife taking a sponge 
bath — (ten other people were 
watching, too; they had no choice 
in the matter, unless they screwed 
their eyes shut) and knocked his 
front teeth out with a belt buckle. 
Two days later, the jealous one turn- 
ed up drifting in the no-G tube 
with his windpipe crushed. Nobody 
seemed to miss him much, not even 
the wife. 

Two hundred and sixty-nine 
hours after we’d kicked free of the 
foundering ship, we were maneu- 
vering for an approach to Cyoc. 
From five hundred miles up, it 



looked like one huge snowball. 

It was my first try at landing 
an atmosphere boat. I’d run through 
plenty of drills, but the real thing 
was a little different. Even with 
fully automated controls that only 
needed a decision made for them 
here and there along the way, there 
were still plenty of things to do 
wrong. I did them all. After four 
hours of the roughest ride this side 
of a flatwheeled freight car, we 
slammed hard in a mountain-rim- 
med icefield something over four 
hundred miles from the beacon sta- 
tion. 

T he rough landing had bloodied 
few noses, one of them mine, 
broken an arm or two, and opened 
a ten-foot seam in the hull that let 
in a blast of refrigerated air. But 
that was incidental. The real dam- 
age was to the equipment compart- 
ment forward. The power plant had 
been knocked right through the side 
of the boat. 

That meant no heat, no light and 
no communications. Assemblyman 
Ognath told me what he thought of 
my piloting ability. I felt pretty 
bad until Ommu got him to admit 
he knew even less about atmosphere 
flying that I did. 

The outside temperature was ten 
below freezing; that made it a 
warm day, for Cyoc. The sun was 
small and a long way off, glaring in 
a dark, metallic sky. It shed a sort 
of gray, before-the-storm light over 
a hummocky spread of glacier that 
ended at blue peaks, miles away. 
Assemblyman Ognath told me that 
now that we were on terra firma he 



SPACEMAN! 



105 




was taJdng charge, and that he 
would waste no time taking steps 
for rescue. He didn’t say what steps. 
1 told him rd retain command as 
long as the emergency lasted. He 
fumed and used some strong lan- 
guage, but I was still wearing the 
gun. 

There were a lot of complaints 
from the passengers about the cold, 
the short rations, the recycled wa- 
ter, bruises and other things. They’d 
been all right in space, glad to be 
alive. Now that they were ashore 
they seemed to expect instant relief. 
I called some of the men aside for 
a conference. 

“I’m taking a party to make the 
march to the beacon,” I told them. 

“Party?” Ognath bellied up to 
me. “We’ll all go! Only by pulling 
together can we hope to survive!” 

“I’m taking ten men,” I said. 
“The rest stay here.” 

“You expect us to huddle here 
in this wreck and slowly freeze to 
death?” Ognath wanted to know. 

“Not you. Assemblyman,” I 
said. “You’re coming with me.” 

He didn’t like that, either. He 
said his place was with the people. 

“I want the strongest, best-fed 
men,” I said. “We’ll be traveling 
with heavy packs at first. I can’t 
have stragglers.” 

“Why not just yourself, and this 
fellow?” Ognath jerked a thumb at 
Ommu. 

“We’re taking half the food with 
us. Somebody has to carry it.” 

“Half the food — for ten men? 
And you’d leave seventy-odd wom- 
en and children to share what’s 
left?” 



“That’s right. We’ll leave now. 
There’s still a few hours of day- 
light.” 

Half an hour later we were ready 
to go, the cat included. The cold 
didn’t seem to bother him. The 
packs were too big by half, but 
they’d get lighter. 

“Where’s your pack. Danger?” 
Ognath wanted to know. 

“I’m not carrying one,” I told 
him. I left the boat in charge of a 
crewman with a sprained wrist. 
When I looked back at the end of 
an hour all I could see was ice. 

W e made fifteen miles before 
sunset. When we camped, 
several of the men complained 
about the short rations, and a 
couple mentioned the food I gave 
Eureka. Ognath made another try 
to gather support for himself as 
trail boss, but without much luck. 
We turned in and slept for five 
hours. It wasn’t daylight yet when 
I rolled them out. One man com- 
plained that his suit pack was 
down; he was shivering, and blue 
around the lips. I sent him back 
and distributed his pack among the 
others. 

We went on, into rougher coun- 
try, sprinkled with rock slabs that 
pushed up through the ice. The 
ground was rising, and footing was 
treacherous. When I called the noon 
halt, we had made another tea 
miles. 

“At this rate, we’ll cover the dis- 
tance in ten days,” Ognath in- 
formed me. “The rations could be 
doubled easily. We’re carrying 
enough for forty days!” 



106 



IF 




He had some support on that 
point. I said no. After a silent meal 
and a ten-minute rest, we went on. 
I watched the men. Ognath was a 
complainer, but he held his posi- 
tion up front. Two men had a ten- 
dency to straggle. One of them 
seemed to be having trouble with 
his pack. I checked on him, found 
he had a bad bruise on his shoul- 
der from a fall during the landing. 
I chewed him out and sent him back 
to the boat. 

“If anybody else is endangering 
this party by being noble, speak up 
now,’* I told them. Nobody did. 
We went on, down to eight men al- 
ready, and only twenty-four hours 
out. 

The climbing was stiff for the 
rest of the day. Night caught us 
halfway to a high pass. Everybody 
was dog-tired. Ommu came over 
and told me the packs were too 
heavy. 

“They’ll get lighter,” I told him. 

“Maybe if you carried one you’d 
see it my way,” he came back. 

“Maybe that’s why I’m not carry- 
ing one.” 

We spent a bad night in the ice 
of an ice-ridge. I ordered all suits 
set for minimum heat to conserve 
power. At dawn we had to dig our- 
selves out of drifted snow. 

We made the pass by mid-after- 
noon, and were into a second line of 
hills by dark. Up until then, every- 
one had been getting by on his in- 
itial charge; now the strain was 
starting to show. When morning 
came, two men had trouble getting 
started. After the first hour, one of 
them passed out cold. I left him 
SPACEAAANI 



and the other fellow with a pack 
between them, to make it back to 
the boat. By dark, we’d put seventy- 
five miles behind us. 

I began to lose track of days then. 

One man slipped on a tricky 
climb around a crevasse, and we lost 
him, pack and all. That left five of 
us: myself, Ommu, Ognath, a pas- 
senger named Choom and Lath, 
one of my Power Section Crew. 
Their faces were hollow, and when 
they pulled their masks off their 
eyes looked like wild animals; but 
we’d weeded out the weak ones 
now. 

At a noonday break, Ognath 
watched me passing out the ration 
cans. 

“I thought so!” His fruity bari- 
tone was just a croak now. “Do 
you see what he’s doing?” He turn- 
ed to the others, who had sprawled 
on their backs as usual as soon as 
I called the halt. “No wonder Dan- 
ger’s got more energy than the rest 
of us! He’s giving himself double 
rations — for himself and the ani- 
mal!” 

They all sat up and stared my 
way. 

“How about it?” Ommu asked. 
“Is he right?” 

“Never mind me,” I told them. 
“Just eat and get what rest you can. 
We’ve still got nearly three hun- 
dred miles to go.” 

Ommu got to his feet. “Time you 
doubled up on rations for all of us,” 
he said. The other two men were 
sitting and watching. 

“I’ll decide when it’s time,” I 
told him. 

107 




“Ognath, open a pack and hand 
out an extra ration all around,” 
Ommu said. 

‘Touch a pack and I’ll kill you,” 
I said. “Lie down and get your rest, 
Onunu.” 

They stood there and looked at 
me. 

“Better be careful how you sleep 
from now on, Danger,” Ommu said. 
Nobody said anything while we fin- 
ished eating and shouldered packs 
and started on. I marched at the 
rear now, watching them. I couldn’t 
afford to let them fail. The Lady 
Raire was counting on me. 

XV 

A t halfway point, I was still feel- 
ing fairly strong. Ognath and 
Choom had teamed up to help each 
other over the rough spots, and 
Ommu and Lath stuck together. 
None of them said anything to me 
unless they had to. Eureka had tak- 
en to ranging far offside, looking 
for game, maybe. 

Each day’s march was like the 
one before. We got on our feet at 
daylight, wolfed down the ration 
and hit the trail. Our best speed was 
about two miles per hour now. The 
scenery never changed. When I es- 
timated we’d done two hundred and 
fifty miles — about the fifteenth 
day — I increased the ration. We 
made better time that day, and the 
next. Then the pace began to drag 
again. The next day there were a 
lot of falls. It wasn’t just rougher 
ground; the men were reaching the 
end of their strength. We halted in 
mid-afternoon, and I told them to 



turn their suit heaters up to me- 
dium range. I saw Ognath and 
Choom sw>ap looks. I went over to 
the Assemblymian and checked his 
suit; it was on full high. So was 
Choom’s. 

“Don’t blame them. Danger,” 
Ommu said. “On short rations they 
were freezing to death.” 

The next day Choom’s heat-pack 
went out. He kept up for an hour; 
then he fell and couldn’t get up. I 
checked his feet; they were frozen 
waxy-white, ice-hard, halfway to 
the knee. 

We set up a tent for him, left 
fourteen-days’ rations, and went on. 
Assemblyman Ognath told me this 
would be one of the items I’d an- 
swer for at my trial. 

“Not unless we reach the bea- 
con,” I reminded him. 

Two days later, Ognath jumped 
me when he thought I was asleep. 
He didn’t know I had scattered ice 
chips off my boots around me as 
a precaution. I woke up just in 
time to roll out of his way. He 
rounded and came for me again, 
and Eureka knocked him down 
and stood over him, snarling in a 
way to chill your blood. Lath and 
Ommu heard him yell and I had to 
hold the gun on them to get them 
calmed down. 

“Rations,” Ognath said. “Divide 
them up now; four even shares I” 

I turned him down. Ommu told 
me what he’d do to me as soon as 
he caught me without the gun. 
Lath asked me if I was willing to 
kill the cat, now that it had gone 
mad and was attacking people. I let 
them talk. When they had it out of 

IF 



108 




their systems, we went on. That af- 
ternoon Ommu fell and couldn’t get 
up. 1 took his pack and told Lath 
to help him. An hour later Lath was 
down. I called a halt, issued a tri- 
ple ration all around and made up 
what was left of the supplies into 
two packs. Ognath complained, but 
he took one and I took the other. 

The next day was a hard one. We 
were into broken ground again, and 
Ognath was having trouble with his 
load, even though it was a lot light- 
er than the one he’d started with. 
Ommu and Lath took turns helping 
each other up. Sometimes it was 
hard to tell which one was helping 
which. We made eight miles and 
pitched camp. The next day we did 
six miles; the next five; the day 
after that, Ognath fell and sprained 
an ankle an hour after we’d started. 
By then we had covered three hun- 
dred and sixty miles. 

“We’ll make camp here,” I said. 
“Ommu and Lath, lend a hand.” 

I used the filament gun on a narrow 
beam to cut half a dozen foot- 
cube blocks of snow. When I told 
Ommu to start stacking them in a 
circle, he just looked at me. 

“He’s gone crazy,” he said. “Lis- 
ten, Lath; you too, Ognath. We’ve 
got to rush him. He can’t kill all. 
three of us — ” 

“We’re going to build a shelter,” 

I told him. “You’ll stay warm there 
until I get back.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
Lath was hobbling around offside, 
trying to get behind me. I waved 
him back. 

“This is the end of the line for 



you. Ognath can’t go anywhere; you 
two might make another few miles, 
but the three of you together will 
have a better chance.” 

“Where do you think you’re go- 
ing?” Ognath got himself up on 
one elbow to call out. “Are you 
abandoning us now?” 

“He planned it this way all 
along,” Lath whispered. His voice 
had gone a couple of days before. 
“Made us pack his food for him, 
used us as draft animals; and now 
that we’re used up, he’ll leave us 
here to die.” 

Ommu was the only one who 
didn’t spend the next ten minutes 
swearing at me. He flopped down 
on the snow and watched me range 
the snow blocks in a ten-foot circle. 
I cut and carried up more and built 
the second course. When I had the 
third row in place, he got up and 
silently started chinking the gaps 
with snow. 

It took two hours to finish the 
igloo, including a six-foot entrance 
tunnel and a sanitary trench a few 
feet away. 

“We’ll freeze inside that,” Og- 
nath was almost blubbering now. 
“When our suit-packs go, we’ll 
freeze!” 

I opened the packs and stacked 
part of the food, made up one light 
pack. 

“Look,” Ognath was staring at 
the small heap of ration cans. 
“He’s leaving us with nothing! 
We’ll starve, while he stuffs his 
stomach!” 

“If you starve you won’t freeze,” 
I said. “Better get him inside,” I 
told Ommu and Lath.

“He won’t be stuffing his stom- 
ach much,” Ommu said. “He’s 
leaving us twice wihat he’s taking 
for himself.” 

“But — where’s all the food he’s 
been hoarding?” 

“We’ve been eating it for the 
past week,” Ommu said. “Shut up, 
Ognath. You talk too much.”” 

I put Ognath in the igloo. It was 
already warmer inside, from the 
yellowish light flickering through 
the snow walls. I left them then 
and, Eureka pacing beside me, 
started off toward what I hoped was 
the beacon. 

M y pack weighed about ten 
pounds; I had food enough for 
three-days’ half rations. I was still 
in reasonable shape, reasonably 
well fed. With luck, I expected to 
make the beacon in a two-day 
march. 

I didn’t have luck. I made ten 
miles before dark, slept cold and 
hungry, put in a full second day. 
By sundown I had covered the forty 
miles, but all I could see was flat 
plain and glare ice, all the way to 
the horizon. According to the chart, 
the beacon was built on a hundred- 
foot knoll that would be visible for 
at least twenty miles. That meant 
one more day, minimum. 

I did the day, and another day. I 
rechecked my log, and edited all the 
figures downward; and I still should 
have been in sight of home base by 
now. That night Eureka disappeared. 

The next day my legs started to 
go. I finished the last of my food 
and threw away the pack. I had a 
suspicion my suit heaters were about 
no 



finished; and now I shivered all the 
time. 

Late that day I saw Eureka, far 
away, crossing a slight ripyple in the 
flat ice. Maybe he was on the trail 
of something to eat. I wished him 
luck. I had a bad fall near sunset 
and had a hard time crawling into 
the lee of a rock to sleep. 

The next day things got rough. I 
knew I was within a few miles of 
the beacon, but my suit instruments 
weren’t good enough to pinpoint it. 
Any direction was as good as an- 
other. I walked east, toward the dull 
glare of the sun behind low clouds. 
When I couldn’t walk any more I 
crawled. After a while I couldn’t 
crawl any more. I heard a buzzing 
from my suit pack that meant the 
charge was almost exhausted. It 
didn’t seem important. I didn’t hurt 
any more, wasn’t hungry or even a 
hit tired. 

It felt good, just floating where I 
was, in a warm, golden sea. Golden, 
the color of the Lady Raire’s skin 
when she lay under the hot sun of 
Gar 28, slim and tawny . Lady 
Raire, a prisoner, waiting for me to 
come for her. 

I was on my feet, weaving, but 
upright. I picked out a rock ahead, 
and concentrated on reaching it. I 
made it and fell down and saw my 
own footprints there. That seemed 
funny. When I finished laughing, it 
was dark. I was cold now. I heard 
voices . 

The voices were louder, and then 
there was light and a man was 
standing over me and Eureka was 
sitting on his haunches beside me, 
washing his face.

XVI 

Q mimu imd Ognath were all 
right; Lath had left the igloo 
and never came back; Choom was 
dead of gangrene. Of the four men 
I had sent back to the boat during 
the first few days, three reached it. 
All of the party at the boat survived. 
We later learned that our boat was 
the only one that got away from the 
ship. We never learned what it was 
we had collided with. 

I was back on my feet in a day 
or two. The men at the beacon sta- 
tion were glad to have an interrup- 
tion in their routine; they gave us 
the best of everything the station 
had to offer. A couple of days later 
a ship arrived to take us off. 

At Ahax, I went before a board 
of inquiry and answered a lot of 
questions, most of which seemed 
to be designed to get me to confess 
that it had all been my fault. But 
in the end they gave me a clean bill 
and a trip bonus for my trouble. 

Assemblyman Ognath was wait- 
ing when I left the hearing room. 

“I understand the board dismissed 
you with a modest bonus and a 
hint that the less you said of the dis- 
aster the better,” he said. 

“That’s about it.” 

“Danger, I’ve always considered 
myself to be a man of character,” 
he told me. “At Cyoc, I was in er- 
ror. I owe you something. What 
are your plans?” 

He gave me a sharp look when 
I told him. “I assume there’s a 
story behind that — but I won’t 
piy.” 

“No secret, Mr. Assemblyman.” 
SPACEMANl 



I told him the story over dinner at 
an eating place that almost made 
up for thirty days on the ice. When 
I finished he shook his head. 

“Danger, do you have any idea 
how long it will take you to work 
your passage to as distant a world 
as Zeridajh?” 

“A long time.” 

“Longer than you’re likely to live, 
at the wages you’re earning.” 

“Maybe.” 

“Danger, as a politician I’m a 
practical man. I have no patience 
with romantic quests. However, you 
saved my life; I have a debt to dis- 
charge. I’m in a position to offer 
you the captaincy of your own ves- 
sel, to undertake a mission of con- 
siderable difficulty — ^but one which, 
if you’re successful, will pay you 
more than you could earn in twenty 
years below decks!” 

T he details were explained to me 
that night at a meeting in a 
plush suite on the top floor of a 
building that must have been two 
hundred stories high. From the ter- 
race where I was invited to take a 
chair with four well tailored and 
manicured gentlemen, the city lights 
spread out for fifty miles. Assem- 
blyman Ognath wasn’t there. One 
of the men did most of the talking 
while the other three listened. 

‘The task we wish you to under- 
take,” he said in a husky whisper, 
“requires a man of sound judg- 
ment and intrepid character; a man 
without family ties or previous con- 
flicting loyalties. I am assured you 
possess those qualities. The assign- 
ment also demands great determin- 

111 




ation, quick wits and high integrity. 
If you succeed, the rewards will be 
gpreat. If you fail, you can expect 
a painful death, and we can do 
nothing to help you.” 

A silent-footed girl appeared with 
a tray of glasses. 1 took one and 
listened. 

“Ahacian commercial interests 
have suffered badly during recent 
decades from the peculiarly insidi- 
ous competition of a non-human 
race known as the Rish. The pat- 
tern of their activities has been 
such as to give rise to the convic- 
tion that more than mere mercan- 
tile ambitions are at work. We have, 
however, been singularly unsuccess- 
ful in our efforts to place observers 
among them.” 

“In other words, your spies 
haven’t had any luck.” 

“None.” 

“What makes this time different?” 
“You will enter Rish-controUed 
space openly, attended by adequate 
public notice. Your movements as 
a lone Ahacian vessel in alien-con- 
trolled space will be followed with 
interest by the popular screen. The 
Rish can hardly maintain their pre- 
tense of cordiality if they offer you 
open interference. Your visit to the 
capital, Hi-Iliat, will appear no more 
than a casual commercial visit.” 

“I don’t know anything about es- 
pionage,” I said. “What would I 
do when I got there — if I got 
there?” 

“Nothing. Your crew of four 
will consist of trained specialists.” 
“Why do you need me?” 
“Precisely because you are not 
a specialist. Your training has been 
112 



other than academic. You have 
faced disaster in space, and sur- 
vived. Perhaps you will survive 
among the Rish. 

It sounded simple enough. I’d 
be gone a year; when I got back, a 
small fortune would be waiting for 
me. The amount they mentioned 
made my head swim. Ognath had 
been wrong. It wasn’t twenty-years’ 
earnings; it was forty. 

“I’ll t^e it,” I said. “But I think 
you’re wasting your money.” 

“We pay you nothing unless you 
return,” the spokesman said. “In 
which case the outlay will not have 
been wasted.” 

T he vessel they showed me in a 
maintenance dock at the port was 
a space-scarred, five-thousand ton- 
ner, built twelve hundred years ago 
and used hard ever since. If the 
Rish had any agents snooping 
around her for hidden armor, multi- 
light communications gear or super- 
drive auxiliaries, they didn’t find 
them. There weren’t any. Just the 
ancient stressed-field generators, 
standard navigation gear, a hold 
full of pre-coded computer tapes 
for light manufacturing operations. 
My crew of four were an unlikely- 
looking set of secret agents. Two 
were ohinless lads with expressions 
of goggle^ed innocence; one was 
a middle-aged man who gave the 
impression of having run away from 
a fat wife; and the last was a tall, 
big-handed, silent fellow with moist 
blue eyes. 

I spent two weeks absorbing ceph- 
alotapes designed to fill in the gaps 
in my education. We lifted off be- 

JF 




fore dawn one chilly morning, 
^th no more fanfare than any oth- 
er tramp steamer leawng harbor. I 
left Eureka behind with one of the 
tech girls from the Training Cen- 
ter. Maybe that was a clue to the 
confidence I was beginning to have 
in the mission. 

For the first few weeks, I en- 
joyed captaining my own ship, even 
as ancient a scow as Jongo. My 
crew stared solemnly when I suited 
up and painted the letters on her 
prow myself. To them, the idea of 
anthropomorphizing an artifact 
with a pet name was really pretty 
weird. 

We made our first planetfall with- 
out incident. I contacted the import- 
ers ashore, quoted prices, bought re- 
placement cargo in accordance with 
instructions, while my four happy- 
go-lucky men saw the town. I 
didn’t ask them what they’d found 
out; as far as I was concerned, the 
less I knew about their activities the 
better. 

We went on, calling at small, 
unpopulous worlds, working our 
way deeper into the bar, then an- 
gling toward galactic south, swing- 
ing out into less densely populated 
space, where Center was a blazing 
arch in the screens. We’d seen, by 
afternoon, Ostrok and twenty other 
worlds, as alike as small towns in 
mid-western United States. And then 
one day we arrived at a planet which 
looked no different than the rest of 
space, but was the target we’d ibeen 
feeling our way toward for five 
months; The Rish capital, and the 
place where, if I made one tiny mis- 
take, I’d leave my bones. 

SPACEMAN! 



T he port of Hi-Iliat was a boom- 
ing, bustling center where great 
shining hulls from all the great 
worlds of the Bar, and even a few 
from Center itself, stood ranged on 
the miles-wide ramps system, as 
proud and aloof as carved Assyrian 
kings. We rode a rampcar in from 
the remote boondocks where we’d 
been parked by traffic control to a 
mile-wide rotunda constructed of 
high arched ribs of white concrete 
with translucent filigree-work be- 
tween them. I was so busy staring 
up at it that I didn’t see the Rish 
official until one of my men prod- 
ded me. I turned and was looking 
at a leathery five-foot oyster all 
ready for a walk on the beach, 
spiniy legs and all. He was making 
thin buzzes and clicks that seemed 
to come from a locket hanging oa 
the front side of him. It dawned on 
me then that it was speaking a dia- 
lect I could understand: 

“All right, chaps, just in from 
out-system, eh? Mind stepping this 
way? A few formalities, won’t take 
a skwrth** 

I didn’t know how long a skwrth 
was, but I followed him, and my 
four beauties followed me. He led 
us into a room that was like a high, 
narrow corridor, too brightly lit 
for comfort, already crowded with 
men and Rish and three or four 
other varieties of life, none of 
which I had ever seen before. We 
sat on small stools as directed and 
put our hands into slots and had 
lights flashed in our eyes and sharp 
tones beeped at our ears. Whatever 
the test was, we must have passed, 
because our guide led us out into a 

113 




ceilingless circular passage like a 
cattle run and addressed us: 

“Now, chaps, as guests of the 
Rish Hierarchy, you’re welcome to 
our great city and to our fair 
world. You’ll find hostelries cater- 
ing to your metabolic requirements, 
and if at any time you are in need 
of assistance, you need merely re- 
pair to the nearest sanctuary sta- 
tion, marked by the white pole, and 
you will be helped. And I must also 
solemnly caution you: Any act un- 
friendly to the Rish Hierarchy will 
be dealt with instantly and with the 
full rigor of the law. I trust you’ll 
have a pleasant stay. Mind the step, 
now.** He pushed a hidden control 
and a panel slid back and he waved 
us through into the concourse. 

An hour later, after an ion-bath 
and a drink at the hotel bar, I set 
out to take a look at Hi-Iliat. It 
was a beautiful town, full of blind- 
ing white pavement, sheer towers, 
tiled plazas with hundred-foot foun- 
tains and schools and shoals of 
Rish, zooming along on tiny one- 
wheeled motorbikes. There were a 
few men in sight, and an equal num- 
ber of aliens. The locals paid no at- 
tention to them, except to ping their 
bikebells at them when they stepped 
out in front of them. 

I foimd a park where orange grass 
as soft as velvet grew under trees 
with polished silver trunks and gold- 
en yellow leaves. There were odd 
little butterfly-like birds there, and 
small leathery animals the size of 
squirrels. Beyond it was a lake, 
with pretty little buildings standing 
up on stilts above the water; I could 
hear twittery music coming from 
114 



somewhere. I sat on a bench and 
watched the big, pale sun setting 
across the lake. It seemed that may- 
be the life of a spy wasn’t so b^ 
after all. 

It was twilight when I started 
back to the hotel. I was halfway 
there when four Rish on green- 
painted scooters surrounded me. 
One of them was wearing a voice 
box. 

“Captain Billy Danger,” he said 
in a squeak like a bat. “You are un- 
der arrest for crimes against the 
peace and order of the Hierarch of 
Rish.” 

XVIII 

T he prison they took me to was 
a brilliantly lit rabbit warren 
of partitions, blind alleys, cubicles, 
passages, tiny rooms where inscrut- 
able oyster-faces stared at me while 
carrying on inaudible conversations 
that made my ear drums itch. I 
asked questions, but got no answers. 
For all I know it was the same oys- 
ter I talked to each time; it might 
even have been the same office. I 
got very hungry and thirsty and 
sleepy, but nobody got out any 
rubber hoses. I could have done 
worse in any small town in Missis- 
sippi. 

After about an hour of these si- 
lent examinations, I wound up in 
a room the size of a phone booth 
with a Rishian wearing a talk-box. 
He told me his name was Humekoy 
and that he was Chief of Physical 
Interrogation and Punishment. I got 
the impression the two duties were 
hard to tell apart. 



IF 




“You are in a most serious posi- 
tion,” he told me in his mechan- 
ically translated squeak. “The Rish 
Hierarchy has no mercy for stran- 
gers seeking to do evil. However, I 
am aware that you yourself have 
merely been used — possibly even 
without your knowledge — as an 
agency for transporting criminals. 
By cooperating with me fully, you 
may save yourself from the more 
unpleasant consequences of your ac- 
tions. Accordingly, you will now 
give me full particulars of the ac- 
tivities of your associates.” 

“I want to see the Ahacian con- 
sul,” I said. 

“Don’t waste my time,” he shrill- 
ed. “What were the specific missions 
of the four agents who accompanied 
you here?” 

“If my crew are under arrest, I 
want to see them.” 

“You have an imperfect grasp of 
the situation. Captain Danger! It 
is / who make the demands!” 

“I’m afraid I can’t help you.” 
“Nonsense, I know you Men too 
well. Each of you would sell his 
own kind to save his person.” 
‘Then why are you afraid to let 
me see the consul?” 

“Afraid?” he made a sound which 
was probably a laugh, but it lost 
something in translation. “Very 
well, then. I grant your plea.” 
They took me to a bigger room 
with softer light and left me, and 
a minute later an egg-^bald man in 
dandified clothes came in, looking 
worried and mad. 

CCT understand you demanded to 
A see me,” he said and hand- 



ed me a gadget and looped a similar 
one around his neck, with attach- 
ment to the left ear and the Adam’s 
apple. I followed suit. 

“Look here. Danger,” his voice 
peeped in my ear. “There’s nothing 
I can do for you! You knew that 
when you came here. Insistence on 
seeing me serves merely to impli- 
cate Ahax.” 

“Who are you kidding?” I sub- 
vocalized. “They know all about the 
mission. Something leaked. That 
wasn’t part of the deal.” 

“That’s neither here nor there. 
Your duty now is to avoid any ap- 
pearance that yours is an official 
mission.” 

“You think they’re dumb enough 
to believe I’m in the spy business 
for myself?” 

“See here. Danger, don’t med- 
dle in affairs that are beyond your 
grasp! You were selected for this 
mission because of your total illit- 
eracy in matters of policy.” 

“Let’s quit kidding,” I said. 
“Why do you think they let you see 
me 

**Let me? They practically kid- 
napped me.” 

“Sure; this is a test. They want 
to see what you’ll do. Species loyalty 
is a big thing with them — I learn- 
ed that much studying tapes, back 
on Ahax. Every time they capture 
and execute a Man with no reac- 
tion from his home world, they get 
a little bolder.” 

“This is nonsense, a desperate 
bid for rescue — ” 

“You made a mistake seeing me, 
Mr. Consul. You can’t pretend you 
don’t know me, now. Better get me 

IF 



T16 




out of this. If you don’t I’ll spill 
the beans.” 

“What’s that?” He looked shock- 
ed. “What can you tell them? You 
know nothing of the actual — ” 
He cut himself off. 

“I can tell them all about you, 
for a starter,” I told him. 

“Tell them what about me?” 
“That you’re the mastermind of 
the Ahacian espionage ring here 
on the Rish World,” I said. “And 
anything else I can think of. Some 
of it might even be true.” 

He got his back stiffened up and 
gave me the old ice^blue glare. 
“You’d play the traitor of the 
Ahacian Assembly, which trusted 
you?” 

“You bureaucrats have a curious 
confidence in the power of one-way 
loyalty. You’d sell me down the 
river just to maintain a polite diplo- 
matic lie; and you expect me to go, 
singing glad hosannahs.” 

He struggled some more, but I 
had him hooked in the eye. In the 
end he said he’d see what he could 
do and went away mopping his fore- 
head. The oysters hustled me into 
an elevator and took me down into 
what must have been a sub-sub- 
basement and made me crawl 
through a four-foot tunnel into a 
dim-lit room with a strange, unpleas- 
ant smell. I was still sniffing and 
trying to remember what it was 
about the odor that made my scalp 
crawl when something moved in 
the deep gloom of the far corner 
and an armored, four-foot midget 
rose up on a set of thick legs and 
two oversized eyes stared at me 
from the middle of its chest. 
SPACEMANI 



F or the first five seconds I stood 
where I was, feeling the sheck 
reaction slamming through my 
brain. Then, without any conscious 
decision on my part, I was diving 
for it. It tried to scuttle aside, but 
I landed on it, grabbed for what 
passed for its throat. Its body arced 
imder me, and the stubby legs beat 
against the floor, and it broke free 
and went for the exit tunnel, 'maik- 
ing a sound like water gurgling 
down a drain. I kicked it away 
from the opening, and it curled up 
and rolled to a neutral corner and 
I stood over it breathing hard and 
looking for a soft spot to attack. 

“Peace!” The words sounded gro- 
tesque coming from what looked 
like an oversized armadillo. “I 
yield, master! Have mercy on poor 
Srat!” Then it made sounds that 
were exactly like an Australian 
bush-baby — or a crying child. 

“That’s right,” I said, and my 
voice had a high, quavering note. 
I could feel the gooseflesh on my 
arms, just from being close to the 
thing. “I’m not ready to kill you 
yet. First you’re going to tell me 
things!” 

“Yes, Master! Poor Srat will tell 
Master everything he knows! All, 
all!” 

“There was a ship — wasp-waist- 
ed, copper-colored, big. It answered 
our distress call. Bugs like you came 
out of it. They sihot me up, but I 
guess they didn’t know much hu- 
man anatomy. And they took the 
Lady Raire. Where did they take 
her? Where is she? What did they 
do to her?” 

“Master, let poor Srat think!” 

117 




it gurgled, and I realized I’d been 
kicking it with every question mark. 

“Don’t think — just give me the 
answers.” I drew a deep breath and 
felt liie rage draining away, and my 
hands started to shake from the re- 
action. 

“Master, poor Srat doesn’t under- 
stand about the lady — ” It oofed 
in anticipation when I took a step 
toward it. 

‘The ship, yes,” it babbled. 
“Long ago poor Srat remembers 
such a ship, all in the beauty of its 
mig^ity form, like a great Mother. 
But that was long, long ago I” 
“Three years,” I said. “On a 
world out in the Arm.” 

“No, Master! Forty years have 
passed away since last poor Srat 
glimpsed the great mother-shape! 
And that was deep in Fringe Space 
— It stopped suddenly, as if it 
had said too much, and I kicked it 
again. 

4 4 poor Srat is in exile,” it 
JL whined. “So far, so far 
from the heaving oil-black bosom 
of the deeps of H’eeaq.” 

“Is that where they took her. To 
H’eeaq?” 

It groaned. “Weep for great 
H’eeaq, Master. Weep for poor 
Srat’s memories of that which was 
once, and can never be again ...” 
I listened to the blubbering and 
groaning and piece by piece, got the 
story from it: H’eeaq, a lone world, 
a hundred lights out toward Galac- 
tic Zenith, where Center spread over 
the sky like a blazing roof; the dis- 
covery that the sun was on the 
verge of a nova explosion; the flight 
118 



into space, the years — centuries of 
gypsy-wandering. And a landing on 
a Rish-controlled world, a small 
brush with the Rish law — and 
forty years of slavery. By the time 
it was finished, I was sitting on the 
bench by the wall, feeling cold, 
washed out of all emotion, for the 
first time in three years. Kicking 
this poor waif wouldn’t bring the 
Lady Raire back home. That left 
me with nothing at all. 

“And Master?” poor Srat whim- 
pered. “Has Master, too, aroused 
the cruel ire of these Others?” 
“Yeah, I guess you could say 
that. They’re using me for a test 
case.” I cut myself off. I wasn’t 
ready to start gossiping with the 
thing. 

“Master — poor Srat can tell 
Master many things about these 
Rishes. Things that will help him.” 
“It’s a little late for that,” I said. 
“I’ve already had my say. Hume- 
koy wasn’t impressed.” 

The H’eeaq crept closer to me. 
“No, Master, listen to poor Srat. Of 
mercy, the Rish-things know noth- 
ing. But in matters of business 
ethic ...” 

I was asleep when they came for 
me. Four guards with symbols 
painted on their backs herded me 
along to a circular room where a 
lone Rish who might have been 
Humekoy sat behind a desk under 
a spotlight. Other Rish came in, 
took seats along the walls behind 
me. My buddy the Ahacian consul 
was nowhere in sight. 

“What will you offer for your 
freedom?” the presiding Rish asked. 

IF 




I stood there temembering what 
Poor Srat had told me aibout the 
Rish and wondering whether to be- 
lieve him. 

“Nothing,” I said. 

“You offer nothing for your 
life?” 

“It’s already mine. If you kill 
me you’ll be stealing.” 

“And if we imprison you?” 
“Stealing is stealing. My life is 
mine, not yours.” 

I felt the silent buzzing that 
meant they were talking it over. 
Then Humekoy picked up two rods, 
a white one and a red one, from 
the desk. He held the white one out 
to me. 

“You will depart the Rish world 
at once,” he said. “Take this sym- 
bol of Rish magnanimity and go.” 
I shook my head, and felt the 
sweat start up. “I’ll take my life 
and freedom because it’s mine, not 
as a gift. I don’t want any gifts 
from you; no gifts at all.” 

“You refuse the mercy of the 
Hierarch?” Humekoy ’s canned voice 
went up off the scale. 

“All I want is what’s mine.” 
More silent conversation. Hume- 
koy put the rods back on the desk. 

“Then go. Captain Danger. You 
have your freedom.” 

“What about my crew?” 

“They are guilty. They will pay 
their debt.” 

“They’re no good to you. I sup- 
pose you’ve already pumped them 
dry. Why not let them go?” 

“Ah, you crave a gift after all?” 
“No. I’ll pay for them.” 

“So? What payment do you of- 
fer?” 

SPACEMAN! 



Poor Srat had briefed me on this, 
too. I knew what I had to do, but 
my mouth felt dry and my stomach 
was quivering. We bargained foe 
ten minutes before we agreed on a 
price. 

My right eye. 

XVII 

T hey were skillful surgeons. They 
took the eye out without anes- 
thetic, other than a stiff drink of 
what tasted like refrigerant fluid. 
Humekoy stood by and watched 
with every indication of deep inter- 
est. As for me, I had already learn- 
ed about pain: the body is capable 
of registering only a certain amount 
of it; about what you’d get from 
laying your palm on a hot-plate. 
After that, it’s all the same. I yell- 
ed and screamed a little, and kick- 
ed around a bit, but it was ever 
very quickly. They packed the 
empty socket with something cold 
and wet that numbed it in a few 
seconds. In half an hour I was back 
on my feet, feeling dizzy and with 
a sort of gauzy veil between my re- 
maining eye and the world. 

They took me to the port, and 
my crew was there ahead of me, 
handcuffed and looking pale green 
around the ears. And the consul 
was there too, with his hands 
clamped up as tight as the rest. 

“It has been a fair exchange, 
Captain Danger,” Humekoy told me 
after the others were aboard. “These 
paid cheats have garnered their pet- 
ty harvest of data on industrial and 
port facilities, volume of shipping 
and sophistication of equipment, on 

119 




which to base estimates of Rish as- 
sault capability. And in return the 
Hierarch has gained valuable in- 
fomnation for proper assessment of 
you humans. Had we acted on the 
basis of impressions gained by study 
of the persons so cleverly trained to 
delude us heretofore, we might have 
made a serious blunder.” 

We parted on that note, not as 
pals, exactly, but with what might 
be described as a mutual wary re- 
spect. At the last minute a ramp 
car pulled up and a pair of Rish 
guards dumped Poor Srat out. 

“The creature aided, indirectly, 
in our rapprochement,” Humekoy 
said. “His payment is his freedom. 
Perhaps you, too, may have an ac- 
count to settle.” 

“Put him aboard,” I said. “He 
and I will have a lot of things to 
cilk over before I get back to 
Ahax.” 

B y the time the fifty-seven day 
voyage was over, I knew as 
much about H’eeaq as Poor Srat 
could tell me. 

“Why these mistaken kin of mine 
may have stolen a lady of Master’s 
kind, I can’t say,” he insisted. But 
as to where — he had a few ideas 
on that. 

‘There are worlds. Master, where 
long ago H’eeaq established markets 
for the complex molecules so abun- 
dantly available to her in those 
days. Our vessels call there still, 
and out of regard for past ties per- 
haps, the in-dwellers supply our 
needs for stores. And in return, we 
give them what we can.” 

He gave me the details of a few 
120 



of these old market places — worlds 
far out in Fringe Space, where few 
questions were asked and a human 
was a rare freak. 

“We’ll go take a look,” I^aid. 
“As soon as I collect my payV’ 

At Ahax, Traffic Control alloted 
me a slot at the remotest corner of 
the port. We docked, and my four 
cheery crewmen were gone in a 
rampcar before I finished securing 
the command deck. I told Srat to 
follow me and started to walk the 
two miles to the nearest power way. 
A rampcar went past in a hurry in 
the next lane over, headed out to- 
ward where my tub was parked. I 
thought about hailing it, but even 
with the chill wind blowing, walk- 
ing felt good, after the weeks in 
space. 

Inside the long terminal building, 
a P.A. voice was droning something. 
Srat made a gobbling noise and, 
said, “Master, they speak of you!” 
I looked where he pointed with one 
flipper and saw my face looking 
down from a public screen. 

“ . distinguishing scar on the 
right side of the neck and jaw,” the 
voice was saying. “It is the duty of 
any person seeing this man to de- 
tain him and' notify Central Author- 
ity at once!” 

N obody seemed to be looking 
my way. I was wearing a plain 
gray shipsuit and a light windbreak- 
er with the collar turned up far 
enough to cover the scar; I didn’t 
look much different than a lot of 
other space-burned crew types. Poor 
Srat was crouching and quivering. 
They hadn’t put him on the air, 

IF 




but he would attract attention with 
his whimipering. We had to get to 
cover, fast. I turned and headed 
for the nearest ramp exit and as I 
reached the vestibule a woman’s 
voice called my name. I spun and 
saw a familiar face; Nacy, the lit- 
tle tech operator I’d left Eureka 
with. 

“I was in Ops Three when your 
clearance request came, four hours 
ago,” she said in a fast whisper. 
She saw the patch over my eye and 
her voice faltered and went on: I 
thought . after all, no one ex- 
pected you to come back ... it 
would be nice to come down and 
meet you. Then ... I heard the 
announcement ...” 

“What’s it all about, Nacy?” 

She shook her head. She was a 
pert little girl with a turned-up nose 
and very white, even teeth. ”I don’t 
know, Billy. Someone said you’d 
gone against your orders, turned 
back early.” 

“Yeah. There’s something in that. 
But you don’t want to be seen talk- 
ing to me.” 

“Billy — maybe if you went to 
them voluntarily ...” 

“I have a funny feeling near the 
back of my neck that says that 
would be a wrong play.” 

Her face looked tight; she nod- 
ded. “I think I understand.” She 
took a bite of her lip. “Come with 
me.” She turned and started across 
the lobby. Srat plucked at my 
sleeve. 

“You’ll do better on your own,” 

I said, and followed her. 

She led me through a door mark- 
ed for private use, along a plain 
SPACEMANl 



corridor with lots of doors, out 
through a small personnel entry on- 
to a parking lot full of ramp ve- 
hicles. 

“Good thing, girl,” I said. 
“You’d better fade out fast now — ” 
“Just a minute.” She ducked back 
inside. I went to a small mail-car- 
rier, found the controls unlocked. 
I started it up and back around 
by the door as it swung open and 
a sleek pepper-and-salt-and-tan an- 
imal stalked through, looking re- 
laxed, as always. 

“Eureka!” I called, and the old 
boy stopped and looked my way, 
then reached the car in one bound 
and was in beside me. I looked up 
and Nacy was watching from the 
door. 

“Thanks for everything,” I said. 
“I don’t know why you took the 
chance, but thanks.” 

“Maybe it’s because you’re what’s 
known as a romantic figure,” she 
said and whirled and was gone be- 
fore I could ask her what that 
meant. 

I pulled the car out and into a 
lane, across the ramp, keeping it at 
an easy speed. There was a small 
click from over my head, and a voice 
said, “7S90, where do you think 
you’re going?” 

“Fuel check,” I mumbled. 

“Little late, aren’t you? You 
heard the clear-ramp order.” 

“Yeah, what’s it all about?” 
“Pickup order out on some smug- 
gler that gave Control the slip a 
few minutes ago. Now get off the 
rampl” 

He clicked off. I angled right as 
if I were headed for the mainten- 

121 




ance bay at the end of the line, but 
at the last second I veered left and 
headed out toward where I’d park- 
ed Jongo. I could see rampcars 
buzzing back and forth, off to my 
left; I passed two uniformed men, 
on foot. One of them stared at me, 
and I kept my chin down in my 
collar and waved to him. A hun- 
dred yards from the tub, I saw the 
cordon of cars around it. So much 
for' my chances of a slick takeoff 
uiKier their noses. I pulled the car 
offside between a massive freighter 
that looked as if it hadn’t been 
moved for a couple of hundred 
years, and a racy yacht that re- 
minded me of Lord Desroy’s, and 
tried to make my brain think. It 
didn’t seem to want to. My eyes 
kept wandering back to the fancy 
eoamel-inlaid trim around the entry 
lock of the yacht. The port was 
open, and I could see the gleam of 
hand-rubbed finishes inside . 

I was out of the car and across 
to the yacht before I realized I’d 
made a decision. Eureka went in 
ahead of me, as if he owned the 
boat. Just as I got a foot on the car- 
peted four-step ladder, one of the 
pedestrian cops came into sight 
around the side of the old freighter. 
He saw me and broke into a run, 
fumbling with a holster at his side 
in a way that said he had orders to 
shoot. I unfroze and started up, 
knowing I wouldn’t make it, and 
heard a scuffling sound and a 
heavy thud and a crash of fire that 
cracked and scorched the inlay by 
the door. I looked back, and he 
was spread out on the pavement, 
out cold, and Poor Srat was un- 
122 



tangling himself from his legs. He 
scrambled in behind me, and I trip- 
ped the port-secure lever and ran 
for the flight deck. I slammed the 
main drive lever to full emergency 
liftoff position and felt my back 
teeth shake as the yacht screamed 
off the ramp, splitting the atmos- 
phere of Ahax like a meterite. 

T be ship handled like a yachts- 
man’s dream. For the first few 
hours I ducked and bobbed in an 
evasion pattern that took us out 
through the planetary patrols. I kept 
the com channels open and lis- 
tened to a lot of excited talk that 
told me I’d picked the personal 
transportation of an Ahacian offi- 
cial whose title translated roughly 
as Assistant Dictator. After a 
while Assemblyman Ognath came 
on, looking very red around the 
ears, and showed me a big, phony 
smile. 

“Captain Danger, there’s been a 
misunderstanding,’’ he warbled. 
“The police officers you may have 
seen at the port were merely a 
guard of honor.” 

“Somebody forgot to tell the gun- 
handlers about that,” I said in a 
breezy tone that I thought would 
have the maximum irritant value. 
”I had an idea maybe you fellows 
decided forty years pay was too 
much to spend, after all. But that’s 
okay. I’ll accept this bucket as 
payment in full.” 

“Look here. Danger.” Ognath let 
the paper smile drop. “Bring the 
vessel back, and I’ll employ my in- 
fluence to see that you’re dealt 
with leniently.” 



IF 




“ITianks; I’ve had a sample of 
your influence. I don’t think I’d 
live through another.” 

’’You’re a fool I Every civilized 
v^orld within ten ^ parsecs will be 
alerted; you’ll be hunted down and 
blasted without mercy — unless you 
turn back now!” 

“I guess the previous owner is 
after somebody’s scalp, eh, Ognath? 
Too bad.” 

I gave him, and a couple of na- 
val types who followed him, some 
more funny answers and in the pro- 
cess managed to get a fair idea of 
the interference I could expect to 
run into. I had to dodge three pa- 
trols in the first twenty hours; by 
the thirtieth hour I was running di- 
rectly toward Galactic Zenith with 
nothing ahead but the Big Black. 

“Give me the coordinates of the 
nearest of the worlds where you 
H’eeaq used to trade,” I ordered 
Srat. 

“It is distant. Master. So far 
away, so lonely. The world called 
Drope.” 

“We’ll try it anyway,” I said. 
“Maybe somewhere out there we’ll 
run into a little luck.” 

The yacht was fueled and sup- 
plied in a way that suggested that 
someone had been prepared for any 
sudden changes in the political cli- 
mate back home. It carried food, 
wines, a library that was all the 
most self-indulgent dictator could 
want to while away those long, 
dull days in space. 

I showed Srat how to handle the 
controls so that he could relieve me 
whenever I felt like taking a long 
nap or sampling the library. I asked 
SPACEMANl 



him why he had stuck with me, but 
he just looked at me with those 
goggle-eyes, and for the first time 
in many weeks it struck me what a 
strange-looking thing he was. You 
can get used to anything, even a 
H’eeaq. 

E ureka was better company than 
the alien, in spite of not being 
able to talk. He settled in, in a cabin 
full of frills that conjured up pic- 
tures of a dance-hall floozie with 
the brain of a Pekinese and a voice 
to match. Fortunately, the dictator’s 
taste in music and books was closer 
to mine than his choice of mistress- 
es. There were tapes aboard on ev- 
erything from ancient human his- 
tory to the latest techniques in cell- 
surgery, thoroughly indexed. I sam- 
pled them all. 

The Fringe Worlds, I learned, 
were the museum of the galaxy. 
These lonely planets had once, long 
eons ago, been members of the 
tightly packed community of Cen- 
ter; their races had been the first 
in the young galaxy to explore out 
through the Bar and Eastern Arm, 
where their remote descendants still 
thrived. Now the ancient Mother- 
worlds lingered on, living out the 
twilight of their long careers, cir- 
cling dying suns, far out in the cool 
galaxies. One of those old races, 
emptiness of the space between 
Srat assured me, was the ancestral 
form of Man — not that I’d rec- 
ognize the relationship if I encoun- 
tered a representative of the tribe. 

One day I ran through a gazeteer 
of the Western Arm, found a listing 
of an obscure sun I was pretty sure 

123 




was Sol and coded its reference in- 
to the index. The documentary that 
came onto the view-screen showed 
me a dull-steel ball bearing with a 
brilliant highlight that the voice 
track said was the system’s tenth 
planet. Number nine looked about 
the same only bigger. Eight and 
seven were big fuzz-balls flattened 
at the poles. I had just about de- 
cided I had the wrong star when 
Saturn swam into view. The sight 
of that old familiar ring made me 
feel homesick, as if I’d spent the 
long happy hours of childhood 
there. I recognized Big Jupe, too. 
The camera came in close on this 
one, and then there were surface 
scenes on the moons. They looked 
just like Luna. 

Mars was a little different than 
the pictures I remembered seeing; 
the ice caps were bigger, and in the 
close scan the camera moved in on 
what looked like the ruins of a 
camp; not a city, just a lash-up col- 
lection of metal huts and fallen an- 
tennas, like a South Pole expedi- 
tion might have left behind. And 
then I was looking at Earth, swim- 
ming there on the screen, cool and 
misty green and upside down, with 
Europe at the bottom and Africa 
at the top. I stared at it for half a 
minute before I noticed that the 
ice caps were wrong. The northern 
one covered most of Germany and 
the British Isles, and as the camera 
swung past, I could see that it 
spread down across North America 
as far as Kansas. And there wasn’t 
any south polar cap. Antarctica was 
a crescent-shaped island, all by it- 
self in the ocean, ice-free; and Aus- 
124 



tralia was connected to Indochma. 
I knew then the pictures had been 
made a long time ago. 

The camera moved in close, and 
I saw oceans and jungles, deserts 
and ice-fields, but nowhere any 
sign of man. The apparent altitude 
at the closest approach was at 
least ten thousand feet, but . even 
from that height I could make out 
herds of game. But whether they 
were mammoths and megatheria or 
something even older, I couldn’t 
tell. 

Then the scene shifted to Venus, 
which looked like Neptune, only 
smaller and brighter, and I switch- 
ed the viewer off and made myself 
a long, strong drink and settled 
down for the long run ahead. 

XIX 

D rope was a lone world, circling 
a tired old star the color of 
sunset in Nevada. No hostile inter- 
ceptors rose to meet me, but there 
was no welcoming committee either. 
We grounded at what Srat said was 
a port, but all I saw was a wind- 
blown wasteland with a few hill- 
ocks around it, under a purplish 
black sky without a star in sight. 
Center being below the horizon. The 
air was cold, and the wind seemed 
to be whispering sad stories in the 
dusk. I went back aboard; I dined 
well and drank a bottle of old Aba- 
dan wine and listened to music, but 
it seemed to be telling sad stories, 
too. Just before dawn Srat came 
back with a report that a H’eeaq 
ship had called — about a century 
ago. Earth time. 



IF 




“That doesn’t help us much,” I 
pointed out. 

“At least — ” Poor Srat got down 
and wriggled in the dust, but I 
sensed a certain insolence in his 
voice “ — at least Master knows 
now I speak truly of the voyages of 
the H’eeaq.” 

“Either that or you’re a consist- 
ent liar,” I said, and stopped. My 
tone of voice when I talked to the 
Midget reminded me of something, 
but I couldn’t say what it was. 
Srat’s informant had mentioned the 
name of H’eeaq vessel’s next port 
of call. A world known as E’el, ten 
lights farther out into intragalactic 
space, which meant a two-weeks’ 
run. I set ship-time up on a cycle 
as close to Earth time as I could 
estimate, and for a while I tried to 
sleep eight hours at a stretch, eat 
three meals a day, and maintain 
some pretense of night and day; 
but the habit of nearly six years in 
space was too strong. I soon revert- 
ed to three on, three off, with 
meals every other off period. 

We picked up E’el on our screens 
at last, a small, dim star not even 
shown on the standard charts. I set 
the yacht down on a grassy plain 
near a town made of little mud- 
colored domes and went into the 
village with Srat. There was nothing 
there but dust and heat and a few 
shy natives who scuttled inside their 
huts as we passed. An hour of that 
was enough. 

After that we called at a world 
that Srat called Zlinn, where a 
swarm of little atmosphere fliers 
about as sturdy as Spade came up 
and buzzed us like irate hornets. 
SPACEMAN! 



They refused us permission to dis- 
embark. If any H’eeaq vessel had 
been there in the last few decades, 
it was their secret. 

We visited Lii, a swamp-world 
where vast batteries of floodlights 
burned all day under a dying sun, 
and Shoramnath, where everyone 
had died since Srat’s last visit. We 
walked around among the bones 
and the rusted machines and the 
fallen-in buildings and wondered 
what had hit them. And we saw 
Far, and Z’reeth, and on Kish they 
let us land and then attacked us, 
just a few seconds prematurely, so 
that we made it back to the lock 
and lifted off in the middle of a 
barrage of HE fire that burned 
some of the shine off the hull. Sui- 
cide fliers threw themselves at us as 
we streaked for space; they must 
have been tough organisms, be- 
cause some of them survived tb.e 
collisions and clung to the hull, and 
I heard them yammering and rat-tat - 
tating there for minutes after v. c 
had left the last of the atmosphere 
behind. 

On Tith, there were fallen tow- 
ers that bad once been two miles 
high, lying in rows pointing north, 
like a forest felled by a meteor 
strike. We talked to the descend- 
ants of the tower builders, and they 
told me that a H’eeaq ship had 
called; a year ago, a century ago, a 
thousand years — it was all the 
same to them. 

W e pushed on, hearing rumors, 
legends, hints that a vessel 
like the one I described had been 
seen once, long ago, or had visit- 

125 




ed the next world out-system, or 
that creatures like Srat had been 
found, dead, on an abandoned 
moon. Then even the rumors ran 
out; and Srat was fresh out of 
worlds. 

“The trail’s cold,” I told him. 
‘There’s nothing out here but 
death and decay and legends. I’m 
turning back for Center.” 

“Only a little farther. Master,” 
Poor Srat pleaded. “Master will find 
what he seeks, if only he presses 
on.” He didn’t have quite the whim- 
pering tone now that he used to 
use. I wondered about Poor Srat; 
what he had up his sleeve. 

“One more try,” I said. “Then 
I turn back and try for Center, even 
if every post office this side of 
Earth has my picture in it.” 

But the next sun that swam into 
range was one of a small cluster; 
eight small, long-lived suns, well 
past Sol on the evolutionary scale, 
but still in their prime. Srat almost 
tied himself into a knot. 

“Well do I remember the Eight 
Suns, Master! These are rich worlds, 
and generous. After we filled our 
holds here with succulent li- 
chens — ” 

“I don’t want any succulent li- 
chens.” I cut off his rhapsody. “All 
I want is a hot line on a H’eeaq 
ship.” 

I picked the nearest of the suns, 
swung in on a navigation beam from 
Drath, the ninth planet, with Srat 
doing the talking to Control, and 
sat the ship down on a ramp that 
looked as though it had survived 
some heavy bombardments in its 
day. A driverless flatcar riding 
126 



on an airstream came out to pick 
us up. We rode it in toward a big 
pinkish-gray structure across the 
field. Beyond it, a walled city 
sprawled up across a range of 
rounded hills. The sky was a pre- 
storm black, but the sun’s heat 
baked down through the haze like 
a smelter. 

There were rank, tropical trees 
and fleshy-looking flowers growing 
along the drive that ran the final 
hundred yards. Up close, I could 
see cracks in the building. 

There were no immigration for- 
malities to clear through, just a 
swarm of heavy-bodied, rob^ hu- 
manoids with skin like hard olive- 
green plastic and oversized faces — 
if you can call something that looks 
like a tangle of fish guts a face. 
Eureka stayed close to my side, 
rubbing against my leg as we push- 
ed through the crowd inside the 
big arrival shed. Srat followed, 
making the oofling sounds that 
meant he didn’t like it here. I told 
him to find someone he could talk 
to and try for some information; 
he picked a non-Drathian, a frail 
little knob-kneed creature creeping 
along by a wall with the fringe of its 
dark blue cloak dragging in the 
mud. It directed him along to a 
stall at the far side of the lobby 
which turned out to be a sort of 
combination labor exchange and lost 
and found. A three hundred pound 
Drathian in a dirty saffron toga 
listened to Srat, then rumbled an 
answer. 

To vessel of H’eeaq has called 
here, says he. Master,” Srat 
IF 




reported. “Drath trades with no 
world. The produce of Drath is 
the most magnificent in the Uni- 
verse; he demands why anyone 
would seek items made elsewhere. 
He says also that he can offer an 
attractive price on a thousand tons 
of glath.” 

“What’s glath?” 

“Mud, Master,” he translated. 

“Tell him thanks, but I’ve sworn 
off.” We left him and pushed on 
through to take a look at the town. 

The buildings were high, blank- 
fronted, stuccoed in drab shades of 
ochre and pink and mauve. There 
was an eerie feeling hanging over 
the place, as if everyone was away, 
attending a funeral. The click and 
clatter and pat-pat of our assorted 
styles of feet was jarringly loud. 
A hot rain started up, to add to 
the cheer. It struck me again how 
alike cities were, on worlds all 
across the galaxy. Where creatures 
gather together to build dwellings 
the system of arranging them in 
rows along open streets was almost 
universal. This one was like a Mex- 
ican village, with water; all poverty 
and mud. I saw nothing that would 
pass for a policeman, an informa- 
tion office, a city hall or govern- 
ment house. After an hour of walk- 
ing I was wet to the skin, cold to 
the bone and depressed to the soul. 

I was ready to' give it up and 
head back to the ship when the 
street widened out into a plaza 
crowded with stalls and carts under 
tattered awnings of various shades 
of gray. Compared to the empty 
streets, the place looked almost gay. 

The nearest stall displayed an as- 
SPACEAAAN! 



sortment of dull-colored balls, rang- 
ing from lemon to grapefruit size. 
Srat tried to find out what they 
were, but the answer was untrans- 
latable. Another bin was filled with 
what seemed to be dead beetles. I 
gathered they were edible, if you 
liked that sort of thing. The next 
displayed baubles and gimcracks 
made of polished metal and stone, 
like jewelry in every time and clime. 
Most of the metal was dull yellow, 
lead-heavy gold, and I felt a faint 
stir of an impulse to fill my pockets. 
Up ahead, an enterprising merchant 
had draped the front of his stall 
with scraps of cloth. From the col- 
ors, I judged he was color-blind, 
at least in what I thought of as the 
visible spectrum. One piece of rag 
caught my eye; it was a soft, silvery 
gray. I fingered it, and felt a shock 
go through me as if I’d grabbed a 
hot wire. But it wasn’t electricity 
that made my muscles go rigid; it 
was the unmistakable feel of Zeri- 
dajhan cloth. 

It was a piece about two feet 
long and a foot wide, raggedly cut. 
It might have been the back panel 
from a ship suit. I started to lift it, 
and the stall-keeper grabbed for it 
and cracked something in the lo- 
cal language, a sound like hot fat 
sizzling. I didn’t let go. 

‘Tell him I want to buy it,” I 
told Srat. 

The stall-keeper tugged and made 
more hot fat sounds. 

“Master, he doesn’t understand 
the trade tongue,” Srat said. 

The merchant was getting ex- 
cited, now. He made an angry buzz- 
ing and yanked hard; 1 zipped the 

127 




doth out of his balled fists; then 
Srat was clutching at my arm and 
saying, “Beware, Master!” 

XX 

I looked around. A large Drathi- 
anan who could have been the 
same one who offered me the load 
of glath except for the white serapi 
across his chitinous shoulder was 
pushing through the gathering 
crowd toward me. Something about 
him didn’t look friendly. As he 
came up, he crackled at the mer- 
chant. The merchant crackled back. 
The big Drathian planted himself in 
front of me and spit words at me. 

“Master,” Srat gobbled, “the 
Rule-keeper demands to know why 
you seek to rob the merchant!” 
‘Tell him I’ll pay well for the 
cloth.” I took out a green trade 
chip that was worth six-months’ pay 
back on the Bar Worlds and hand- 
ed it over, but the Rule-keeper still 
didn’t seem satisfied. 

“Find out where he got the 
cloth, Srat,” I said. There was more 
talk then. I couldn’t tell whether 
the big Drathian was a policeman, 
a guild official, a racket boss or an 
ambulance-chasing shyster, but he 
seemed to pull a lot of weight. The 
stall-keeper was scared to death of 
him. 

“Master, the merchant swears he 
came by the rag honestly; yet if 
Master insists, he will make him a 
gift of it.” 

“I’m not accusing him of any- 
thing. I just want to know where 
the cloth came from.” 

This time the bully-boy did the 
128 



talking, ended by pointing across 
the plaza. 

“Master, a slave sold the cloth 
to the merchant.” 

“What kind of slave?” 

“Master ... a man-slave.” 
“Like me?” 

“He says — yes, Master.” 

I let my elbow touch the butt of 
my filament pistol. If the crowd 
that had gathered around to watch 
and listen decided to turn nasty, it 
wouldn’t help much; but it was 
comforting anyway. 

“Where did he see this man- 
slave?” 

“Here, Master. The slave is the 
property of Least Triarch.” 

“Find out where the Triarch 
lives.” 

“There, Master.” Srat pointed to 
a dusty blue facade rising behind 
the other buildings like a distant 
cliff-face. “That is the palace of 
His Least Greatness.” 

“Let’s go.” I started past the 
Rule-keeper, and he jabbered at 
Srat. 

“Master, he says you have for- 
gotten his bribe.” 

“My mistake.” I handed over an- 
other clip. “Tell him I’d like his as- 
sistance in getting an interview 
with the Triarch.” 

A price was agreed on, and he 
led the way across the plaza and 
through the network of dark streets, 
along a complicated route that end- 
ed in a tiled courtyard with a yel- 
low glass roof that made it look 
almost like a sunny day. There 
were trees and flowedng shrubs 
around a reflecting pool, a shady 
cloister along , the far side. Srat was 

IF 




nervous; he perched on a chair and 
mewed to himself. Eureka stretched 
out and stared across at a tall blue- 
legged bird wading in the pool. 

A small Drathian came over and 
took orders. He asked Eureka three 
times what he’d have; he couldn’t 
seem to get the idea that the old 
cat didn’t speak the language. The 
drinks he brought were a thick, 
blue syrup with a taste of sulphur 
and honey. Srat sniffed his cup 
and said, “Master must not drink 
this,” and proceeded to swallow his 
share in one gulp. I stared into the 
shadows under the arcade where my 
guide had disappeared and pre- 
tended to nibble the drink. Rain 
drummed on the glass overhead. It 
was steamy hot, like a greenhouse. 
After half an hour, the Drathian 
came back with a friend. 

The newcomer was six feet tall, 
five feet wide, draped in dark blue 
velvet and hung with ribbons and 
tassels and fringes like a Victorian 
bonnet. He was introduced as Hru- 
ba. He was the Triarch’s majordo- 
mo, and he spoke very bad, but 
understandable Lingua. 

“You may crave one boon of his 
Greatness,” he stated. “In return, 
he will accept a gift.” 

“I understand the Triarch owns 
a human slave,” I said. “I’d like to 
see him, if his Greatness has no ob- 
jection.” 

The majordomo agreed and 
gave orders to a servant; in ten min- 
utes the servant was back, prodding 
a man along ahead of him. 

He was a stocky, strong-looking 
fellow with close-cropped black 
hair, well-cut features, dressed in 
SPACEMANl 



a plain dark blue kilt. There was an 
ugly, two-inch scar on his left side, 
just below the ribs. He saw me 
and stopped dead and his face 
worked. 

“You’re a human being!” he 
gasped — in Zeradajhi. 

H is name was Huvile, and he had 
been a prisoner for ten years. 
He’d been captured, he said, when 
his personal boat had developed 
drive-control troubles and had car- 
ried him off course into Fringe 
Space. 

“In the name of humanity. Mi- 
lord,” he begged. “Buy my free- 
dom.” He looked as if he wanted to 
kneel, but the big Drathian servant 
was holding his arm in a two-hand- 
ed grip. 

“I’ll do what I can,” I said. 
“Save me, Milord — and you’ll 
never regret it I My family is 
wealthy.” That was as far as he 
got before Hruba waved an arm 
and the servant hustled him away. 
I looked at the majordomo. 

“How much?” 

“He is yours.” 

I expressed gratification and of- 
fered money in return. Hruba in- 
dicated that Bar money was hard 
to spend on Drath. I ran through a 
list of items from Jongo II’s well- 
stocked larders and storage hold; 
we finally agreed on a mixed con- 
signment of drugs, wines, clothing 
and sense tapes. 

His Greatness will be gratified,” 
Hruba said expansively, “at this op- 
portunity to display his gracious- 
ness.” He aimed a sense-organ at 
me. “Ah . you wouldn’t by 

129 




chance wish to accept a second 
slave?” 

“Another man?” 

“As it happens.” 

“How many more humans have 
you got?” 

“His Greatness owns many prop- 
erties; but only the two humans.” 
His voice got almost confidential. 
“Useful, of course, but a trifle, ah 
intractable. But you'll have no trou- 
ble on that score I’m sure.” 

We dickered for ten minutes and 
settled on a deal that would leave 
Jongo II’s larder practically strip- 
ped. It was lucky the Triarch didn’t 
own three men; I couldn’t have af- 
forded any more. 

“I will send porters and a car 
to fetch these trifles from your ves- 
sel,” Hruba said, “which his Great- 
ness accepts out of sentiment. You 
wish the slaves delivered there?” 
“Never mind; I’ll take them my- 
self.” I started to get up. 

Hruba made a shocked noise. 
“You would omit the ceremonies of 
Agreement, of Honorable Dealing, 
of Mutual Satisfaction?” 

I calmed him down, and he sent 
his staff scurrying for the necessary 
celebratory paraphernalia. 

“Srat, you go to the ship, hand 
over the goods we agreed on, and 
see that the men get aboard all 
right. Take Eureka with you.” 
“Master, Poor Srat is afraid to 
go alone — and he fears for Mas- 
ter — ” 

“Better get going or they’ll be 
there ahead of you.” 

He made a sad sound and hurried 
away. 

“Your other slave,” the major- 



domo pointed. Across the court, a 
Drathian servant came out from a 
side entry leading a slim figure in 
a gray kilt like Huvile had worn. 

“You said another man,” I said 
stupidly. 

“Eh? You doubt it is a man?” 
he said in a stiff voice. “It is not 
often that the probity of His Least 
Greatness is impunged in his own 
Place of Harmonious Accord!” 

“My apologies.” ! tried to recov- 
er. “It was just a matter of termin- 
ology. I didn’t expect to see a fe- 
male.” 

“Very well, a female man — 
but still a man and a sturdy work- 
er,” the majordomo came back. 
“Not so large as the other, perhaps, 
but diligent, diligent. Still, his 
Greatness would not have you feel 
cheated ...” His voice faded off. 
He was watching me as I watched 
the servant leading the girl past, 
some twenty feet away. She had a 
scar on her side, exactly like 
Huvile’s. Beside the horny, gray- 
green thorax of the Drathian beside 
her, her human breast looked in- 
credibly vulnerable. Then she turn- 
ed her head my way, and I saw that 
it was the Lady Raire. 

XXI 

F or a long, echoing instant, time 
stood still. Then she was past. 
She hadn’t seen me, sitting in the 
deep shade of the canopy. I heard 
myself make some kind of sound 
and realized I had half risen from 
my chair. 

“This slave is of some particular 
interest for you?” the majordomo in- 

IF 



130 




quired, and I could tell from the 
edge on his voice that his commer- 
cial instinct was telling him he had 
missed a het somewhere. 

I sat down. “No,” I managed to 
croak. “I was wondering about the 
scars.” 

“Have no fear. The cicatrice 
merely marks the point where the 
control drive is imbedded. However, 
perhaps I shoujd withdraw His 
Greataess’s offer of this gift, since 
it is less than you expected, lest the 
generosity of the Triarch suffer re- 
flection.” 

“My mistake,” I said. “I’m per- 
fectly satisfied.” I could feel my 
heart slamming inside my chest. I 
felt as though the universe was bal- 
anced on a knife-edge. One wrong 
word from me and the whole frag- 
ile deal would collapse. 

The liquor pots arrived then, and 
conversation was suspended while 
my host made a big thing of tasting 
half a dozen varieties of syrupy 
booze and organizing the arrange- 
ment of outsize drinking pots on 
the taible. I sat tight and sweated 
bullets and wondered how it was 
going back at the ship. 

The Drathian offered the local 
equivalent of a toast. While my host 
sucked his cup dry, I pretended to 
take a sip, but he noticed and 
writhed his face at me. 

“You do not sip! Is your zeal for 
Honorable Dealing less than com- 
plete?” 

This time I had to drink. The 
stuff had a sweet overflavor, but 
left an aftertaste of iron filings. 
I forced it down. After that, there 
was another toast. He watched to 



be sure I drank it. I tried not to 
think about what the stuff was do- 
ing to my stomach. I fixed my 
thoughts on a face I had just seen, 
looking no older than the day I 
had seen it last, nearly four years 
before; and the smooth, sun-tanned 
skin, and the hideous scar that 
marred it. 

There was a lot of chanting and 
exchanging of cups, and I chewed 
another drink. Srat would be show- 
ing Milady Raire to a cabin now, 
and she’d be feeling the softness 
of a human-style 'bed, a rug under 
her bare feet, the tingle of the ion- 
bath for the first time in four 
years . 

“Another toast!” Hruba called. 
His command of Lingua was slip- 
ing; the booze was having a power- 
ful effect on him. It was working 
on me, too. My head was buzzing 
and there was a frying-egg feeling 
in my stomach. 

CCT’ve had all I can take,” I 

A said, and felt my tongue slur 
the words. It was hard to push the 
chair back and stand. Hruba rose, 
too. He was swaying slightly — or 
maybe it was just my vision. 

“I confess surprise, man,” he 
said. “Your zeal in the pledging of 
honor exceeded even my own. My 
brain swims in a sea of consecrated 
wine!” He turned to a servant 
standing by and accepted a small 
box from him. 

“The control device governing 
your new acquisition,” he said and 
handed the box over to me. I took 
it, and my finger touched a hidden 
latch and the lid valved open. 

IF 



132 




There was a small plastic ovoid in- 
side, bedded in floss. 

“What’s . what’s this?” 

“Ah, you are unfamiliar with our 
Drathian devices!” He plucked the 
egg from its niche and waved it 
under my nose. 

“This gnurled wheel. On the first 
setting, it administers a sharp re- 
minder; at the second position — ” 
He pushed the control until it 
clicked — “an attack of angina 
which doubles the object in torment. 
And at the third . but I must not 
demonstrate the third setting, eh? 
Or you will find yourself with a 
dead slave on your hands, his heart 
burned to charcoal by a magnesium 
element buried in the organ itself!” 
He tossed the control back into the 
box and sat down heavily. “That 
pertaining to the female is in pos- 
session of her tender; he will leave 
it in the hands of your servant. 
You’ll have no trouble with ’em.” 
He made a sound that resembled a 
hiccup. 

I tilted the box and dumped the 
ovoid on the ground and stamped 
on it; it crunched like a blown egg. 
Hruba came out of his chair in a 
rush. “Here — what are you do 
ing!” He stared at the smashed con- 
troller, then at me. “Have you 
lost your mind, Man?” 

“I’m going now,” I said, and went 
past him toward the passage I had 
entered by a long time ago, it seem- 
ed. Behind me, Hruba was shouting 
in the local dialect. 

Out on the street, night had fall- 
en, and the wet pavement glimmer- 
ed under the yellow-green glare of 
lanterns set on the building fronts. 
SPACEMANl 



I felt deathly ill. The street seemed 
to be rising up under my feet. I 
staggered, stayed on my feet by 
holding onto the wall. A pain like 
a knifethrust stabbed into my stom- 
ach. I headed off in the direction 
of the port, made half a black be- 
fore I had to lean against the wall 
and retch. When I straightened there 
were half a dozen Drathians stand- 
ing by. 

I passed the plaza where I had 
found the Zeridajhi cloth, recognized 
the street along which Srat and Eu- 
reka and I had come. It seemed to 
be a steep hill, now. My legs felt 
like soft tallow: I fell and got up 
and fell again. I retched until my 
stomach was a dry knot of pain. It 
was harder getting to my feet this 
time. My lungs were on fire. 

T hen I saw the port ahead, the 
translucent, glowing dome rising 
at the end of the narrow alleyway. 
Not much farther, now. Srat would 
be wondering what happened; may- 
be he would be waiting, just ahead. 
And at the ship, the Lady Raire . 

I was lying on my face, and the 
sky was spinning slowly over me, a 
pitch-black canopy with the great 
dim blur of Center sprawled across 
it, and the faint avenue that was the 
Bar reaching out to trail off into 
the dwindling spiral curve of the 
Eastern Arm. I found the pavement 
under me, and pushed against it, 
and got to my knees; then to my 
feet. I could see the ship across the 
ramp, tall and rakish, her 'high pol- 
ish dimmed by the years of hard 
use, her station lights glaring amber 
from high on her slim prow. I 

133 




steadied myself and started across 
toward her, and as I did the rec- 
tangle of light that was the open 
port jiarrowed and winked out. The 
lomiber lights flicked out and the red 
and green pattern of her running 
lights sprang up. I stopped dead and 
felt a drumming start up, vibrating 
through the pavement under my 
feet. 

I started to run then, and my legs 
were broken straws that collapsed 
and my head hit and the blow 
cleared it for a moment. I got my 
chin up off the pavement; and 
Jong0 II lifted, standing up away 
from the surface on a tenuous pillar 
of blue flame that lengthened as she 
rose. Then she was climbing swiftly 
into the night. 

''T^hey were all around me in a 
A tight circle. I stared at their 
homy shins, their sandaled feet, as 
alien as an alligator’s, and felt the 
icy sweat clammy on my face. 
Deathly sickness rose inside me in 
a wave that knotted my stomach and 
left me quivering like a beached 
jellyfish. 

The legs around me stirred and 
gave way to a tall Drathian in the 
white serape of a Rule-keeper. 
Hard hands clamped on me, drag- 
ged me to my feet. A light glared 
in my face. 

“Man, the Rule-keeper demands 
you to produce the two slaves given 



as a gift to you by his Least Great- 
ness!” 

“Gone,” I gargled the words. 
“Tmsted Srat. Filthy Midget ...” 

“Man, you are guilty of a crime 
of the first category! Illegal manu- 
mission of slaves! To redress these 
crimes, the Rule-keeper demands a 
fine of twice the value of the slaves, 
plus triple bribes for himself and 
his attendants!” 

“You’re out of luck,” I said. “No 
money ... no ship ... all gone . .” 

I felt myself blacking out then. 
I was dimly aware of being car- 
ried, of lights glaring on me, later 
of a pain that seemed to tear me 
open, like a rotten fruit; but it was 
all remote, far away, happening to 
someone else . 

I came to myself lying on a hard 
pallet on a stone floor, still sick, 
but clear-headed now. For a while, 
I looked at the lone glare-bulb in 
the ceiling and tried to remember 
what had happened, but it was all a 
confused fog. I sat up and a red- 
hot hook grabbed at my side. I 
pulled back the short, coarse-weave 
jacket I was wearing, and saw a liv- 
id, six-inch cut under my ribs, neat- 
ly stitched with tough thread. 

It was the kind of wound that 
would heal in a few weeks and 
leave a welted scar; a scar like I’d 
seen recently, in the sides of Hu- 
vile and the Lady Raire. A scar 
that meant I was a slave.

FAMILY LOYALTY 

by STAN ELLIOTT 



Nice of you to volunteer to emigrate 
from Earthy Joey. It was getting too 
crowded — especially for guys like me! 



May 21, 2157 
Mr. Joseph L. Seaworthy 
Apartment 9006 
Spaac Tower 
Luxemburg Complex 
Benilux City, Europe 
Dear Joey: 

Janie and I were just shocked to 
hear the news about you and Sylvia. 
Your sister Ellen called a few days 
ago and told us, and I swear Janie 
hasn’t stopped crying since. She 
wanted to call you right away but 
I told her not to, as I figure you 
had enough on your mind without 
us bothering you. Not that I don’t 
feel bad too; after all, we’ve been 
like brothers, being raised together 
and all. 

Anyway, we were sitting in our 
apartment tonight when I asked 
Janie, “When are Joey and Syl due 
to Jumpoff?” And she figured it out 
and it came to just 90 days from 



today and I said, “Janie, we really 
should do something for Joe and 
Syl to show how much we appreci- 
ate the sacrifice they are making 
by leaving everything behind and 
going out to settle the Universe.” 
“What do you have in mind, 
lover?” Janie asked. One thing 
about her, she’s not like so many of 
these modem wives but lets me 
have my way before telling me 
what she thinks. So I told her all 
about the great idea of mine to 
buy that property you own in the 
Canadian Rockies. 

“The way I look at it, sweetie,” 
I explained, “Joey and Sylvia don’t 
have any more use for the proper- 
ty so the least we can do for them 
is to take it off their hands at a 
fair price. So, suppose we offer 
them CR3000 for it.” 

“Gee, honey,” Janie came back 
at me, “we can’t afford to spend 



135 




that much money; and besides, that 
sounds like an awful lot for a house 
with only five bedrooms and a me- 
dium-siz^ pool.” 

“Sweetheart,” I told her, “it’s 
the least we can do for two great 
people like Joey and Sylvia. After 
all, now that they’ve been tapped 
for Exodus, they’ve got to give up 
everything and become part of a 
team that’s going to a far-away 
world with all its dangers and dis- 
comforts. In fact, I think I’ll raise 
that to CR 3500.” 

Anyway, Joey, there you have it. 
Like I told Janie, I haven’t got any 
real use for the property but as we 
don’t have a vacation home of our 
own, I thought it 'might be fun to 
run up to the Rockies every once 
in a while and do some repair work 
on the house or just supervise the 
repairmen. Better let me know 
right away so we can get the title 
transferred before you blast. Be sure 
to give my love to Sylvia and tell 
her how much we’re going to miss 
her. 

All my best 

Harry

Mr. Harry Aimes 
86341 Central City 
Ohio District 
U.S.A. 

Dear Harry: 

Sylvia and I were both surprised 
to receive your letter. Ever since 
you stamped out of our apartment 
that time I refused to appoint you 
supervisor at the Omaha-West plant, 
we’ve been wondering how you 
were making out. I heard about 
136 



you losing your job with Marcy 
Watermaking and was shocked at 
the charges, but Tm sure the hear- 
ing will vindicate you. 

Actually, Syl and I were not 
drafted but volunteered to go to 
Kelso III. Now that the kids are 
gone, there really isn’t much to keep 
us here, so we decided to try the 
excitement of colonizing a new 
planet. I understand that Kelso III 
has a pleasant climate, which will 
make it nice for us older people; 
and there are no reports of dan- 
gerous native life, which suits an 
old coward like me just fine. At our 
age we have no longing for “ad- 
venture” and our idea of romance is 
to cuddle up and watch a good tri- 
vee show. So you see that we do 
not feel badly about leaving old 
Mother Earth but are looking for- 
ward to a whole new and useful 
life. 

I’m sorry that I have to answer 
you by letter rather than calling di- 
rect, but ever since the names have 
been made public we have been 
positively hounded by all sorts of 
I>eople wanting to sell us things or 
offering to buy our belongings at 
ridiculous prices. It finally got so 
bad that we had our phones dis- 
connected and rarely bother an- 
swering the doorbell. We have such 
a short time left on Earth that we 
cannot bear to waste it on ghouls 
and con men. I got the impression 
that a whole industry has grown up 
around, or perhaps because of, the 
monthly colonization parties. The 
government is more than generous 
in the matter of severance pay or, 
in the case of a private businessman 

IF 




iike myself, will buy your business 
at the full market price. They do 
restrict you to 50 kilos of personal 
belongings and among 10,000 peo- 
ple this must add up to quite a list 
of items that must be disposed of. 

In the event that we don’t hear 
from you again, Sylvia and I wish 
you and Janie all the happiness in 
the world. 

All my best, 

Joe

Mr. Joseph L. Seaworthy

Dear Joey: 

Boy, were Janie and I glad to 
hear from you. It’s been three weeks 
since we wrote and for a while we 
were afraid you were just too busy 
with final preparations to bother 
answering us. Of course we would 
have understood, as it’s only eight 
weeks ’til blastoff, but we would 
have been very disappointed. As it 
is, your letter came this morning 
and I just wish you could have seen 
how it cheered Janie up. The poor 
kid works so hard all day that my 
heart goes out to her. Some day 
when things break right for me 
I’m going to make her quit that 
lousy job and spend the rest of her 
life just sitting around and taking 
it easy. 

Anyway, I enjoyed your letter very 
much but I got to admit that at 
first I was shocked to hear that you 
volunteered to ship out. Then I 
though it over and decided that I 
FAMILY LOYALTY 



admire you and Sylvia very, very 
much. Imagine wanting to go a 
million light-years to start a life on 
a brand new planet that might be 
filled with all kinds of ferocious an- 
imals and loathsome diseases. Boy, 
you sure got more courage than I 
have, Joey! 

I think it’s terrible that all those 
people keep bothering you about 
your furniture and stuff. I can’t un- 
derstand why the government does 
not put a stop to that kind of thing. 
After all, if we don’t keep sending 
people out every month there soon 
wouldn’t be room enough for all 
the people left on Earth; but I real- 
ly think that those that stay behind 
shouldn’t be allowed to bother the 
settlers during their last days at 
home. Janie agrees with me on this 
and I’m going to write our Repre- 
sentative about it as soon as I can 
find time. 

You must have overlooked it, but 
in my last letter I offered to take 
your vacation shack off your hands. 
I’ve heard how those damn real es- 
tate vultures won’t offer a man any- 
thing for his property once th^ 
know he’s shipping out and I can’t 
stand the idea of anyone pulling 
that stuff on one of my relatives, 
so you just say the word, Joey boy, 
and I’ll stat you a check for 
CR4500 so fast it’ll shock you. Bey, 
it makes me mad to think that these 
kind of guys would take advantage 
of great people like you and Syl 
who are giving up everything to go 
out and make the Universe safe for 
mankind. 

You’ll have to excuse the short 
letter, but I’m anxious to bear from 

137 




you about the siback. Boy, I’m just 
steamed about all (hose people try- 
ing to cheat you. Remember, Joey 
boy, just say the word and I’ll have 
a check in your hands in no time. 

All our love,

Dear Harry: 

How very nice to get another let- 
ter from you before we leave. We 
still have five weeks but most of 
our friends have said good-by al- 
ready and have since treated us as 
though we were already gone. I 
suppose you can’t blame them; pro- 
tracted farewells are a bore, but it 
makes it rather lonely for Sylvia 
and myself. I suppose there is a 
very good reason for this just as 
there are good reasons for sending 
10,000 people each month to col- 
onize another planet. It’s just that 
it can be hard on the people that 
have to leave. 

Now that the farewells have been 
said, I’m spending all my time dis- 
posing of our possessions. It’s amaz- 
ing how much a family accumulates 
during thirty years of marriage; and 
I have run across things I didn’t 
even know we had, as well as things 
I thought were long discarded and 
forgotten. For example, remember 
that time I got the maintenance 
franchise for Spaac Tower and 
bought all those robo-maints and 
hired you to run the operation? I 
found all the bills you ran up be- 
138 



fore getting into an argument with 
Mr. Spaac and losing the contract. 
I will admit I was very angry with 
you that time, Harry, but as Sylvia 
pointed out to me, it only took five 
years to recoup the losses and the 
money doesn’t mean that much to 
us where we’re going anyway, so 
why not forgive and forget. 

I would have answered your let- 
ter sooner, but Syl is in Borneo 
with Ronnie and Helen. She has 
been there for the past three weeks 
and I spent part of the first week 
with her. Those grandchildren of 
ours are the most beautiful children 
I’ve ever seen. Sylvia swears kids 
are smarter these days, but I doubt 
it. I just think our grandchildren 
ore smarter. You really should let 
Janie take a year off and have 
twins or even triplets. They add so 
much to an apartment. 

Try not to worry much about the 
upcoming trial. I’m sure the in- 
dictment sounds a lot worse than it 
really is. 0f course, that larceny- 
by-trick conviction five years ago 
may influence the jurors; but I un- 
derstand Judge Jason will probably 
preside and, knowing him as well 
as I do, I’m sure he will be com- 
pletely fair. 

Thank you again for taking the 
trouble to write to us, Harry. I 
have always had a tender spot in 
my heart for you, perhaps because 
of my love for your mother. I was 
so young when Mom died that I 
tend to think of Aunt Serene as my 
mother. I remember so well the 
day you were born and how proud 
she was and the hopes she — Oh^ 
well, I’m afraid I’m getting mor- 

IF 




bid. This is probably the last you’ll 
ever hear from me, so God keep 
you and I wish you only happiness 
in the future. 

With all my love,

Dear Joe: 

Isn’t there any way I can reach 
you by phone? It’s over a month 
since I wrote. Your letter arrived 
just this morning and I spent all 
day trying to reach you. Janie is 
going to be mad when she sees the 
bill I ran up. Christ, it must be 
CR50 easy! You weren’t kidding 
when you said that you couldn’t be 
reached! I must have talked to 50 
of your neighbors but nobody could 
get hold of you. 

Joey, buddy. I’ll level with you 
about that Canadian property. It’s 
taking all my money to fight this 
water-steal thing and if Janie and 
I could live there we could use the 
money saved to hire a better lawyer. 
Damn it all, what if I did drill a 
well and sell a few thousand gallons 
of water? There’s more than that 
wasted every day. Don’t tell me 
those politicians don’t get all the 
water they want. In fact, I got it 
on good authority that oiu sweet 
mayor actually has a bathtub in the 
official penthouse and takes a bath 
every week and damn the citizens 
if they don’t like it. The sono-baths 
ore good enough for us mortals. 
FAMILY LOYALTY 



I’d come to see you, Joey, but the 
cops won’t let me leave the Ohio 
District of the city. So the best I 
can do is get this letter in the mail 
right away. Please, Joey, for old 
times sake, let me buy that prop- 
erty. 

Regards to Sylvia

Dear Harry: 

Please bear with me as I’m still 
feeling the after-effects of our prep- 
shots. It’s the funniest feeling. You 
sit down in this odd-looking chair 
and the robo-doc asks you a few 
questions and then you get up and 
go home. While you’re answering 
the questions the robodoc is giving 
you ail kinds of injections. I don’t 
know how they manage to get 
through the clothes, but they do; 
and by the time you get home, 
you’re feeling dizzy and nauseous. 
I wish the feeling would wear off 
already, but the robo-doc says it 
will last right up to the time we 
enter deepfreeze. 

Harry, Sylvia and I have talked 
it over and decided that we are no 
longer angry at you. This is prob- 
ably the last time we shall commu- 
nicate as we plan to enter deep- 
freeze day after tomorrow. I don’t 
know if I mentioned it, but the 
voyage will take three hundred 
years so we will never meet again 
in this life. I will admit that Sylvia 
and I both find it hard to overlook 



139 




the past but we are going to make 
an honest attempt at it. 

Harry, I always knew that it was 
you that sold me out to the Barking 
trust that time. I wondered how 
they knew just the moment my 
Flanger was down for reorientation 
and they could flood my reclaim 
tanks; so I hired a detective agency 
and found my trusted associate and 
first cousin had sold the informa- 
tion for the princely sum of 
CR350. As it worked out, I man- 
aged to salvage enough of the busi- 
ness to buy the water concession 
for Omaha-West. This could have 
put the whole family in private 
homes with unlimited water privi- 
leges but again you could not bear 
to pass up the chance for an extra 
credit or two. The main reason I 
sold out was because I knew about 
the well you were digging and had 
no intention of being involved in 
anything as serious as that. That 
was also why I wouldn’t appoint 
you supervisor. Anyway, Harry, this 
is all in the past now and I want 
you to accept my forgiveness in the 
humble spirit in which it is prof- 
fered 

Good^by 

Joe

Joe: 

All right, you want me to crawl 
and I’m crawling. I got to have that 
property to bribe the Water Mar- 
140 



shal with. You know what the pen- 
alty for Water Misuse is. Please, 
please don’t let it happen to me. I 
admit lall those things you men- 
tioned and I apologize. I’m sorry 
for everything I ever did to you, 
Joey, but I must have that proper- 
ty. Dear God, don’t let them con- 
vict me of Water Misuse. If you 
have any sense of family loyalty at 
all, you’ll let me have the house. 
It’s no good to you where you’re 
going anyway. I found out that the 
Water Marshal wants a house — 
any house — of his own badly 
enough to swear that I just-^finished 
digging the weU and never pumped 
a drop. All I have to do is sell it 
to him and I got a chance. Please, 
Joey, please, Sylvia, don’t let them 
convict me on a Water Misuse 
charge. Help me!

Dear Harry: 

I would have missed your letter 
if I hadn’t came back to the apart- 
ment for my make-up kit. You 
know how I always manage to for- 
get it. I don’t have time to write you 
a proper letter as Joseph is buzzing 
me from the roof. So, good-by, dear, 
and remember that we forgive and 
love you. We’ve given the house 
away to the orphans of some of the 
people who di^ of thirst last year.

do have gi7/s, breathe wafer, look 
like monsters — and die like flies? 



I 

S ometimes I go down to the port, 
splashing sand with my stiff foot 
at the end of my stiff leg locked in 
my stiff hip, with the useless arm 
a-s winging, to get wet all over 
again, drink in the dives with old 
cronies ashore, feeling old, broken, 
sorry for myself, laughing louder 
and louder. The third of my face 
that was burned away in the acci- 
dent was patched with skingrafts 
from my chest, so what’s left of 
my mouth distorts all loud sounds; 
sloppy sartorial reconstruction. Al- 
so I have a hairy chest. Chest hair 



does not look like beard hair, and 
it grows all up under my right eye. 
And: my beard is red, my chest 
hair brown, while the thatch curl- 
ing down over neck and ears is sun- 
streaked to white here, darkened 
to bronze there, ’midst general 
blondness. 

By reason of my being a walking 
(I suppose my gait could be called 
headlong limping) horror show, 
plus a general inclination to sulk, 
I spend most of the time up in the 
wood and glass and aluminum 
house on the surf-sloughed point 
that the Aquatic Corp gave me 
along with my pension. Rugs from 



141 





Turkey there, cooper pots, my ten- 
or recorder which I can no longer 
play, and my books. 

But sometimes, when the gold fog 
blurs the morning, I go down to 
the beach and Ixomp barefoot in 
the wet edging of the sea, search- 
ing for driftglass. 

I t was foggy that morning, and 
the sun across the water moil- 
ed the mists around like a brass 
ladle. I lurched to the top of the 
rocks, looked down through the tall 
grasses into the frothing inlet where 
she lay and blinked. 

She sat up, long gills closing 
down her neck and the secondary 
slits along her back just visible at 
their tips because of much hair, 
wet and curling copper, falling 
there. She saw me. “\^at are you 
doing here, huh?” She narrowed 
blue eyes. 

“Looking for driftglass.” 

“What?” 

“There’s a piece.” I pointed near 
her and came down the rocks like 
a crab with one stiff leg. 

“Where?” She turned over, half 
in, half out of the water, the webs 
of her fingers cupping nodules of 
black stone. 

While the water made cold over- 
tures between my toes, I picked up 
the milky fragment by her elbow 
where she wasn’t looking. She jump- 
ed, because she obviously had 
thought it was somewhere else. 
“See?” 

“What . what is it?” She 
raised her cool hand to mine. For 
a moment the light through the 
milky gem and the pale film of 



my own webs pearled the screen 
of the palms. (Details like that. Yes, 
they are the important things, the 
points from which we suspend lat- 
er pain.) A moment later wet fin- 
gers closed to the back of mine. 

“Driftglass,” I said. “You know 
all the Coca-Cola bottles and cut 
crystal punch bowls and industrial 
silicon slag that goes into the sea?” 

“I know the Coca-Cola bottles.” 

“They break, and the tide pulls 
the pieces back and forth over the 
sandy bottom, wearing the edges, 
ch^ging their shape. Sometimes 
chemicals in the glass react with 
chemicals in the ocean to change 
the color. Sometimes veins work 
their way through a piece in pat- 
terns like snowflakes, regular and 
geometric; others, irregular and an- 
gled like coral. When the pieces 
dry they’re milky. Put them in wa- 
ter and they become transparent 
again.” 

“Ohhh!” She breathed as though 
the beauty of the blunted triangu- 
lar fragment in my palm assailed 
her like perfume. Then she looked 
at my face, blinking the third, 
aqueous-filled lid that we use as a 
correction lens for underwater vis- 
ion. 

She watched the ruin calmly. 

Then her hand went to my foot 
where the webs had been torn back 
in the accident. She began to take 
in who I was. I looked for horror, 
but saw only a little sadness. 

The insignia on her buckle — her 
stomach was making little jerks the 
way you always do during the first 
few minutes when you go from 
breathing water to air — told me

she was a Biological Technician. 
(Back up at the house there was a 
similar uniform of simulated scales 
folded in the bottom drawer of the 
dresser and the belt insignia said 
Depfth Gauger.) I was wearing some 
very frayed jeans and a red cotton 
shirt with no buttons. 

She reached up to my neck, 
pushed my collar back from my 
shoulders and touched the tender 
slits of my gills, outlining them with 
cool fingers. “Who are you?” Fi- 
nally. 

“Cal Svenson.” 

S he slid back down in the water. 

“You’re the one who had the 
terrible . but that was years ago. 
They still talk about it, down . 
She stopped. 

As the sea softens the surface of 
a piece of glass, so it blurs the 
souls and sensibilities of the people 
who toil beneath her. And accord- 
ing to the last report of the Marine 
Reclamation Division there are to 
date seven hundred and fifty thou- 
sand who have been given gills and 
webs and sent under the foam 
where there are no storms, up and 
down the American coast. 

“You live on shore? I mean 
around here? But so long ago ...” 
“How old are you?” 

“Sixteen.” 

“I was two years older than you 
when the accident happened.” 

“You were eighteen?” 

“And I’m twice that age now. 
Which means it happened almost 
twenty years ago. It is a long time.” 
“They still talk about it.” 

“I’ve almost forgotten,” I said. 



“I really have. Say, do you play 
the recorder?” 

“I used to.” 

“Good! Come up to my place 
and look at my tenor recorder. And 
I’ll make some tea. Perhaps you 
can stay for lunch — ” 

“I have to report back to Marine 
Headquarters by three. Tork is go- 
ing over the briefing to lay the 
cable for the big dive, with Tonni 
and the crew.” She paused, smiled. 
“But I can catch the undertow and 
be there in half an hour if I leave 
by two-thirty.” 

On the walk up I learned her 
name was Ariel. She thought the 
patio was charming, and the mosaic 
evoked, “Oh, look!” and, “Did you 
do this yourself?” a half-dozen 
times. (I had done it, in the first 
lonely years.) She picked out the 
squid and the whale in battle, the 
woundeed shark and the diver. She 
told me she didn’t get time to read 
much, but she was impressed by all 
the books. She listened to me rem- 
inisce. She talked a lot to me about 
her work, husbanding the deep- 
down creatures they were scaring 
up. Then she sat astraddle the kitch- 
en chair, playing a Lukas Foss ser- 
enade on my recorder while I put 
rock salt in the bottom of the broil- 
er tray for two dozen Oysters Rock- 
efeller and the tea water whistled. 
I’m a comparatively lonely guy. I 
like being followed by beautiful 
young girls.

He nodded to me from the center 
of his nets, sun glistening on the 
polished heads of his shoulders, sun 
lost in the rough mass of his hair. 
I walked across the nets to where 
he sat, sewing like a spider. He pull- 
ed another section up over his 
horny toes, then grinned at me with 
his mosaic smile: gold, white, black 
gap below, crooked yellow; white, 
gold, white. Shoving my bad leg in 
front, I squatted, 

“I fished out over the coral 
where you told me.” He filled his 
cheek with his tongue and nodded. 
“You come up to the house for a 
drink, eh?” 

“Fine.” 

“Now a moment more.” 

There’s a certain sort of Brazil- 
ian you find along the shore in the 
fishing villages, old, yet ageless. See 
one of their men and you think he 
could be fifty, he could be sixty — 
will probably look the same when 
he’s eighty-five. Such was Juao. We 
once figured it out. He’s seven hours 
older than I am. 

We became friends sometime be- 
fore the accident when I got tangled 
in his nets working high lines in 
Vorea Current. A lot of guys would 
have taken their knife and hacked 
their way out of the situation, ruin- 
ing fifty-five, sixty dollars worth 
of nets. That’s an average fisher- 
man’s .income down here. But I 
surfaced and sat around in his boat 
while he untied me. Then we came 
in and got plastered. Since I cost 
him a day’s fishing, I’ve been giv- 
ing him hints on where to fish ever 
since. He buys me drinks when I 
come up with something. 



This has been going on for twen- 
ty years. During that time my life 
has been smashed up and land- 
bound. In the same time Juao has 
married off his five sisters, got mar- 
ried himself and had two children. 
(Oh, those bolitos and teneros asa~ 
dos that Amalia of the ohed braid 
and laughing breasts would make 
for Sunday dinner/supper/Monday 
breakfast.) 1 rode with them in 
the ambulance ’copter all the way 
into Brasilia and in the hospital hall 
Juao and I stood together, both still 
barefoot, he tattered with fish scales 
in his hair, me just tattered, and 1 
held him while he cried and I tried 
to explain to him how a world that 
could take a pre-pubescent child 
and with a week of operations make 
an amphibious creature that can 
exist for a month on either side of 
the sea’s foam-fraught surface, 
could still be helpless before cer- 
tain general endocrine cancers 
coupled with massive renal deteri- 
oration. Juao and I returned to the 
village alone, by bus, three days be- 
fore our birthday — back when I 
was twenty-three and Juao was 
twenty-three and seven hours old. 

Ci'^his morning,” Juao said. (The 
A shuttle danced in the web 
at the end of the orange line.) “I 
got a letter for you to read me. It’s 
about the children. Come on, we 
go up and drink.” The shuttle 
paused, back-tracked twice, and he 
yanked the knot tight. We walked 
along the port toward the square. 
“Do you think the letter says that 
the children are accepted?” 

“It’s from the Aquatic Corp. 



DRIFTGLASS 



145 




And they just send postcards when 
they reject someone. The question 
is, how do you feel about it?” 

“You are a good man. If they 
grow up like you, then it will be 
fine.” 

“But you’re still worried.” I’d 
been prodding Juao to get the kids 
into the International Aquatic Corp 
nigh on since I became their god- 
father. The operations had to be 
performed before puberty. It would 
meian much time away from the vil- 
lage during their training period — 
and they might eventually be sta- 
tioned in any ocean in the world. 
But two motherless children had 
not been easy on Juao or his sis- 
ters. The Oorp would mean educa- 
tion, travel, interesting work, the 
things that make up one kind of 
good life. They wouldn’t look twice 
their age when they were thirty- 
five; and not too many amphimen 
look like me. 

“Worry is part of life. But the 
work is dangerous. Did you know 
there is an amphiman going to try 
and lay cable down in the Slash.” 

I frowned. “Again?” 

“Yes. And that is what you tried 
to do when the sea broke you to 
pieces and burned the parts, eh?” 
“Must you be so damned pictur- 
esque?” I asked. “Who’s going to 
beard the lion this time?” 

“A young amphiman named 
Tork. They speak of him down at 
the docks as a brave man.” 

“Why the hell are they still trying 
to lay the cable there? They’ve 
gotten by this long without a line 
through the Slash.” 

“Because of the fish,” Juao said. 



“You told me why twenty years 
ago. The fish are still there, and we 
fishermen who can not go below 
are still here. If the children go for 
the operations, then there will be 
less fishermen. But today ...” He 
shrugged. “They must either lay the 
line across the fish paths or down 
in the Slash.” Juao shook his head. 

Funny things, the great power 
cables the Aquatic Corp has been 
strewing across the ocean floor to 
bring power to their undersea mines 
and farms, to run their oil wells — 
and how many flaming wells have 
I capped down there — for their 
herds of whale, and chemical distil- 
lation plants. They carry two hun- 
dred sixty cycle current. Over cer- 
tain sections of the ocean floor, or 
in sections of the water with cer- 
tain mineral contents, this sets up 
inductance in the water itself 
which sometimes — and you will 
probably get a Nobel prize if you 
can detail exactly why it isn’t al- 
ways — drives the fish away over 
areas up to twentyy-five and thirty 
miles, unless the lines are laid in 
the bottom of those canyons that 
delve suddenly into the ocean floor, 

“This Tork thinks of the fisher- 
men. He is a good man too.” 

I raised my eyebrows — the one 
that’s left, anyway — and tried to 
remember what my little Undine 
had said about him that morning. 
And remembered not much. 

“I wish him luck,” I said. 

“What do you feel about this 
young man going down into the 
coral rimmed jaws to the Slash?” 

I thought for a moment. “I think 
I hate him.”

uao looked up. 

“He is an image in a mirror 
where I look and am forced to re- 
gard what I was,” I went on. “I 
envy him the chance to succeed 
where I failed, and I can come on 
just as quaint as you can. I hope 
he makes it.” 

Juao twisted his shoulders in a 
complicated shrug (once I could 
do that) which is coastal Brazilian 
for, “I didn’t know things had pro- 
gressed to that point, hut seeing 
that they have, there is little to be 
done.” 

“The sea is that sort of mirror,” 
I said. 

“Yes.” Juao nodded. 

Behind us I heard the slapping of 
Sandies on concrete. I turned in 
time to catch my goddaughter in my 
good arm. My godson had grabbed 
hold of the bad one and was swing- 
ing on it. 

“Tio Cal — ” 

“Hey, Tio Cal, what did you 
bring us?” 

“You will pull him over,” Juao 
reprimanded them. “Let go.” 

And, bless them, they ignored 
their father. 

“What did you bring us?” 

“What did you bring us, Tio 
Cal?” 

“If you let me. I’ll show you.” 
So they stepped back, green-eyed 
and quivering. I watched Juao 
watching. His eyes were brown pu- 
pils on ivory balls, and in the left 
eye a vein had broken in a jagged 
smear. He was loving his children, 
who would soon be as alien to him 
as the fish he netted. He was look- 
ing at the terrible thing that was 



me and wondering what would 
come to his own spawn. And he 
was watching the world turn and 
grow older, clocked by the waves, 
reflected in that mirror. 

It’s impossible for me to see 
what the population explosion and 
the budding colonies on Lima and 
Mars and the flowering beneath the 
ocean really look like from the dis- 
rupted cultural melange of a coastal 
fishing town. But I come closer 
than many others, and I know what 
I don’t understand. 

I pushed around in my rocket 
and fetched out the milky fragment 
I had brought from the beach. 
“Here. Do you like this one?” And 
they bent above my webbed and 
alien fingers. 

I n the supermarket, which is the 
biggest building in the village, 
Juao bought a lot of cake mixes. 
“That moist, delicate texture,” 
whispered the box when you lifted 
it from the shelf, “with that deep 
flavor, deeper than chocolate.” 

I’d just read an article about the 
new vocal packaging in a U.S. mag- 
azine that had gotten down last 
week, so I was prepared and stayed 
in the fresh vegetable sectiom to 
avoid temptation. Then we went up 
to Juao’s house. The letter proved 
to be what I’d expected. The kids 
had to take the bus into Brasilia to- 
morrow. My godchildren were on 
their way to becoming fish. 

We sat on the front steps and 
drank and watched the donkeys, 
and the motorbikes, the men in 
baggy trousers, the women in yellow 
scarfs and brighter skirts with 



DRIFTGLASS 



147 




wreaths of garlic and sacks of on- 
ions. As well, a few people glittered 
by in the green scales of amphimen 
uniforms. 

Finally Juao got tired and went 
in to take a nap. Most of my life 
has been spent on the coast of 
countries accustomed to siestas, but 
those first formative ten were pass- 
ed on a Danish collective farm and 
the idea never really took. So I 
stepped over my goddaughter, who 
Itad fallen asleep on her fists on the 
bottom step, and walked back 
through the town toward the beach. 

m 

A t midnight Ariel came out of 
the sea, climbed the rocks and 
clicked her nails against my glass 
wall so that droplets ran down, 
pearled by the gibbous moon. 

Earlier I had stretched in front 
of the firei^ace on the sheepskin 
throw to read, then dozed off. The 
conscientious timer had asked me 
if there was anything I wanted, and 
getting no answer had turned off 
the Dvorak Cello Concerto that was 
on its second time around, extin- 
guished the reading lamp, and stop- 
ped dropping logs onto the flame 
so that now, as I woke, the grate 
was carpeted with coals. 

She clicked on the glass again, 
and I raised my head from the cush- 
ion. The green uniform, her amber 
hair — all color was lost under the 
silver light outside. I lurched across 
the rug to the glass wall, touched 
the button, and the glass slid down 
into the floor. The breeze came to 
my face, as the barrier disappeared.

“What do you want?” I asked. 
“What time is it, anyway?” 

“Tork is on the beach, waiting 
for you.” 

The night was warm but windy. 
Below the rocks silver flakes chas^ 
each other into shore. The tide lay 
full. 

I rubbed my face. “The new boss 
man? Why didn’t you bring him up 
to the house? What does he want 
to see me about?” 

She touched my arm. “Come. 
They are all down on the beach.” 

“Who all?” 

“Tork and the others.” 

She led me across the patio and 
to the path that wound to the sand. 
The sea roared in the moonlight. 
Down the beach people stood 
around a driftwood fire that whip- 
ped into the night. Ariel walked be- 
side me. 

Two of the fishermen from town 
were crowding each other on the 
bottom of an overturned washtub, 
playing guitars. The singing, rau- 
cous and rhythmic, jarred across 
the paled sand. Shark’s teeth shook 
on the necklace of an old woman 
dancing. Others were sitting on an 
overturned dinghy, eating. 

Over one part of the fire on a 
skillet two feet across, oil frothed 
through pink islands of shrimp. One 
woman ladled them in, another la- 
dled them out. 

“Tio Cal!” 

“Look, Tio Cal is here!” 

“Hey, what are you two doing 
up?” I asked. “Shouldn’t you be 
home in bed?” 

“Poppa Juao said we could come. 
He’ll be here, too, soon.”

I turned to Ariel. “Why are they 
all gathering?” 

“Because of the laying of the 
cable tomorrow at dawn.” 

Someone was running up the 
beach, waving a bottle in each 
hand. 

“They didn’t want to tell you 
about the party. They thought that 
it might hurt your pride.” 

“My what . .” 

“If you knew they were making 
so big a thing of the job you had 
failed at — ” 

“But — ” 

“ — and that had hurt you so 
in failure. They did not want you to 
he sad. But Tork wants to see you. 
I said you would not be sad. So I 
went to bring you down from the 
rocks.” 

“Thanks, I guess.” 

‘Tio Cal?” 

But the voice was bigger and 
deeper than a child’s, 

T Te sat on a log back from the 
AJ. fire, eating a sweet potato. The 
flame flickered on his dark cheek- 
bones, in his hair, wet and black. 
He stood, came to me, held up his 
hand. I held up mine and we slap- 
ped palms. “Good.” He was smil- 
ing. “Ariel told me you would 
come. I will lay the power line 
down through the Slash tomorrow.” 
His imiform scales glittered down 
his aims. He was very strong. But 
standing still, he still moved. The 
light on the cloth told me that. “I 
. ” He paused. I thought of a 
nervous, happy dancer. “I wanted 
to talk to you about the cable.” I 
thought of an eagle, I thought of a 



shark. “And about the . acci- 
dent. If you would.” 

“Sure,” I said. “If there’s any- 
thing I could tell you that would 
help.” 

“See, Tork,” Ariel said. “I told 
you he would talk to you about it.” 
I could hear his breathing change. 
“It really doesn’t bother you to 
talk about the accident?” 

I shook my head and realized 
something about my voice. It was 
a boy’s voice that could imitate a 
man’s. Tork was not over nineteen 
or twenty. 

“We’re going fishing soon,” Tork 
told me. “Will you come?” 

“If I’m not in the way.” 

A bottle went from the woman at 
the shrimp crate to one of the gui- 
tarists, down to Aj*iel, to me, then 
to Tork. (The liquor, made in a 
cave seven miles inland, was almost 
rum. The too tight skin across the 
left side of my mouth makes the 
manful swig a little difficult to 
bring off. I got ‘rum’ down my 
chin.) 

He drank, wiped his mouth, pass- 
ed the bottle on and put his hand 
on my shoulder “Come down to 
the water.” 

We walked away from the fire. 
Some of the fishermen stared after 
us. A few of the amphimen glanced 
and glanced away. 

“Do all the young people of the 
village call you Tio Cal?” 

“No. Only my godchildren. Their 
father and I have been friends since 
I was your age.” 

“Oh, I thought perhaps it was a 
nickname. That’s why I called you 
that.”

We reached wet sand where or- 
ange light cavorted at our feet. The 
broken shell of a lifeboat rocked in 
moonligjht. Toork sat down on the 
shell’s rim. I sat beside him. The 
water splashed to our knees. 

“There’s no other place to lay 
the power cable?” I asked. “There 
is no other way to take it except 
through the Slash?” 

“I was going to ask you what you 
thought of the wibole business. 
But I guess I don’t really have to.” 
He shrugged and clapped his hands 
together a few times. ’’All the proj- 
ets this side of the bay have grown 
huge and cry for power. The new 
operations tax the old lines unmer- 
cifully. There was a power failure 
last July in Cayine down the shelf 
below the twili^t level. The whole 
village was without lights for two 
days, and twelve amphimen died of 
overexposure to the cold currents 
coming up from the depths. If we 
laid the cables farther up, we chance 
disrupting our own fishing opera- 
tions as well as those of the fisher- 
men on shore.” 

I nodded. 

“Cal, what happened to you in 
the Slash?” 

E ager, scared Tork. I was re- 
membering now, not the acci- 
dent, but the midnight before, pac- 
ing the beach, guts clamped with 
fists of fear and anticipation. Some 
of the Indians back where they 
make the liquor still send messages 
by tying knots in palm fibers. One 
could have spread my entrails then, 
or Tork’s tonight, to read our re- 
spective horospecs. 



Juao’s mother knew the knot 
language, but he and his sisters 
Qieveir bothered to learn because 
they wanted to be modem, and, as 
children, still confused with moder- 
nity with the new ignorances, lack- 
ing modem knowledge. 

“When I was a boy,” Tork said, 
“we would dare each other to walk 
down the boards along the edge of 
the fiery slip. The sun would be hot 
and the boards would rock in the 
water, and if the boats were in and 
you fell down between the boats 
and the piling, you could get kill- 
ed.” He shook his head. “The cra2iy 
things kids will do. That was back 
when I was eight or nine, before I 
became a waterbaby.” 

“Where was it?” 

Tork looked up. “Oh. Manila. 
Fm Filipino.” 

The sea licked our knees, and the 
gunwale sagged under us. 

“What happened in the Slash?” 
“There’s a volcano flaw near the 
base of the Slash.” 

“I know.” 

“And the sea is as sensitive down 
there as a fifty-year-old woman 
with a new hairdo. We had an ava- 
lanche. The cable broke. And the 
sparks were so hot and bright they 
made gouts of foam fifty feet high 
on the surface, so they tell me.” 
“What caused the avalanche?” 

I shrugged. “It could just been a 
God-damned coincidence. There are 
rock falls down there all the time. 
It could have been the noose from 
the machines — though we masked 
them pretty well. It could have been 
something to do with the induc- 
tance from the smaller cables for

the machines. Or maybe somebody 
just kicked out the wrong stone that 
was holding everything up.” 

One webbed hand became a fist, 
sank into the other, and hung. 

Calling, “Cal!” 

I looked back. Juao, pants rolled 
to his knees, shirt sailing in the sea 
wind, stood in the weave of white 
water. The wind lifted Tork’s hair 
from his neck; and the fire roared 
up on the beach. 

Tork looked back too. 

“They’re getting ready to catch 
a big fish!” Juao called. 

Men were already pushing their 
boats out. Tork clapped my shoul- 
der. “Come, Cal. We fish now.” 
We stood up and went back to the 
shore. 

Juao caught me as I reached dry 
sand. “You ride in my boat, Cal.” 

Someone came with the acrid 
flares that hissed. The water slap- 
ped around the bottom of the boats 
as we wobbled into the swell. 

Juao vaulted in and took up the 
oars. Around us green amphimen 
walked into the sea, struck forward, 
and were gone. 

Juaro pulled, leaned, pulled. The 
moonlight slid down his arms. The 
fire diminished on the beach. 

T hen among the boats, there was 
a splash, an explosion, and the 
red flare bloomed in the sky: the 
amphimen had sighted a big fish. 

The flare hovered, pulsed once, 
twice, three times, four times 
(twenty, forty, sixty, eighty stone 
they estimated its weight to be), 
then fell. 

Suddenly I shrugged out of my 
152 



shirt, pulled at my belt buckle. 
“I’m going over the side, Juao!” 

He leaned, he pulled, he leaned. 
“Take the rope.” 

“Yeah. Sure.” It was tied to the 
back of the boat. I made a loop 
in the other end, slipped it around 
my shoulder. I swung my bad leg 
over the side, flung myself on the 
black water — 

— mother of pearl shattered over 
me. That was the moon, blocked by 
the shadow of Juao’s boat ten feet 
overhead. I turned below the rip- 
pling wounds Juao’s oars made 
stroking the sea. 

One hand, and one foot with tom 
webs, I rolled over and looked 
down. The rope snaked to its end, 
and I felt Juao’s strokes pulling me 
through the water. 

They fanned below with under- 
water flares. Light undulated on 
their backs and heels. They circled, 
they closed, like those deep sea 
fish who carry their own illumina- 
tion. I saw the prey, glistening as 
it neared a flare. 

You chase a fish with one spear 
among you. And that spear would 
ibe Tork’s tonight. The rest have 
ropes to bind him that go up to the 
fishermen’s boats. 

There was a sudden confusion of 
lights below. The spear had been 
shot! 

The fish, long as a tail and a 
short man together, rose through 
the ropes. He turned out to sea, 
trailing his pursuers. But others 
waited there, tried to loop him. 
Once I had flung those ropes, treat- 
ed with tar and lime to dissolve the 
slime of the fish’s body and hold 

IF 




to the beast. The looped ropes 
caught, and by the movement of the 
flares, I saw them jerked from 
their paths. The fish turned, rose 
again, this time toward me. 

He pulled around when one line 
ran out (and somewhere on the 
surface the prow of a boat doffed 
deep) but turned back and came on. 

Of a sudden, amphimen were 
flicking about me as the fray’s cen- 
ter drifted by. Tork, his spear dug 
deep, forward and left of the mar- 
lin’s dorsal, had hauled himself 
astride the beast. 

The fish tried to shake him, then 
dropped his tail and rose straight. 
Everybody started pulling toward 
the surface. I broke in foam and 
grabbed Juao’s gunwale. 

Tork and the fish exploded up 
among the boats. They twisted in 
the air, in moonlight, in foam. The 
fish danced across the water on its 
tail, fell. 

Juao stood up in the boat and 
shouted. The other fishermen 
shouted too, and somebody perched 
©n the prow of a boat flung a rope 
and someone in the water caught it. 

Then fish and Tork and me and 
a dozen amphimen all went under- 
water at once. 

They dropped in a corona of bub- 
bles. The fish struck the end of an- 
other line, and shook himself. Tork 
was thrown free, but doubled back. 

Then the lines began to haul the 
beast up again, quivering, whipping, 
quivering again. 

Six lines from six boats had him. 
For one moment he was still in the 
submarine moonlight. I could see 
his wound tossing scarfs of blood. 
DRIFTGLASS 



W hen he (and we) broke surface, 
he was thrashing again, noaiT 
Juao’s boat. I was holding onto the 
side when suddenly Tork, iglistieniflig, 
came out of the \yater beside me 
and went over into the boat, 

“Here you go,” he said, turning 
to kneel at the bobbing rim, aad 
pulled me up while Juao leaned 
against the far side to keep bal- 
ance. 

Wet rope slopped on the prow. 
“Hey, Cal!” Tork laughed and 
grabbed it up, and began to haul. 

The fish moiled in the white wa- 
ter. 

The boats came together. The 
amphimen had all climbed up. Ariel 
was across from us, holding a flare 
that drooled smoke down her sum 
as she peered by the hip of the 
fisherman who was standing in 
front of her. 

Juao and Tork were hauling the 
rope. Behind them I was coiling it 
with one hand as it came back to 
me. 

The fish came up and was flap- 
ped into Ariel’s boat, tail out, head 
up, chewing air a few moments 
more. 

I had just finished pulling on my 
trousers when Tork fell down on 
the seat behind me and grabbed 
me around the shoulder with his wet 
arm. “Look at our fish, Tio Call 
Look!” He gasped air, laughing, his 
dark face diamonded beside the 
flares. “Look at our fish there. 
Cal!” 

Juao, grinning white and gold, 
pulled us back into shore. The fhe, 
the singing hands beating hands — 
and my godson had put pebbles in 

153 




the empty rum bottle and was shak- 
ing it in time to the music — the 
guitars spiraled around us as we 
cairied the fish up the sand and 
the men brought the spit. 

“Watch it!” Tork said, grasping 
the pointed end of the great stick 
that was thicker than his wrist. 

We turned the fish over. 

“Here, Cal?” 

He prodded two fingers into the 
widte flesh six inches back from 
the boriey lip. 

“Fine.” 

Tork jammed the spit in. 

We worked it through the body. 
By the time we carried it to the 
fire, they had brought more rum. 

“Hey, Tork. Are you going to 
get some sleep before you go down 
in the morning?” I asked. 

He shook his head. “Slept all af- 
ternoon.” He pointed toward the 
roasting fish with his elbow. “That’s 
my breakfast.” 

But when the dancing grew vio- 
lent a few hours later, just before 
the fish was to come off the fire, 
and the kids were pushing the last 
of the sweet potatoes from the ash- 
es with sticks, I walked back to the 
water to the lifeboat shdl we had 
sat on earlier. It was three quarters 
flooded. 

Curled below still water, Tork 
slept, fist loose before his mouth, 
t3ae gills at die back of his neck 
pulsing rhythmically. Only his 
shoulder and hip made islands in 
the floated boat. 

4 4TT^here’s Tork?” Arid asked 
VVme at the fire. They were 
swinging up the sizzling fish. 

154 



“Taking a nap.” 

“Oh, he wanted to cut the fish!” 

“He’s got a lot of work coming 
up. Sure you want to wake him 
up?” 

“No, I’ll let him sleep.” 

But Tork was coming up from 
the water, brushing his dripping 
hair back from his forehead. 

He grinned at us, then went to 
carve the meat. I remember him 
standing on the table by the fire, 
astraddle the meat, arm going up 
and down with the big knife ((de- 
tails, yes, those are the things you 
remember) stopping to hand down 
the meat, then hauling his arm 
back to cut again. 

That night, with music and 
stomping on the sand and shouting 
back and forth over the fire, we 
made more noise than the sea.

T he eight-thirty bus was more or 
less on time. 

“I don’t think they want to go,” 
Juao’s sister said. She was accom- 
panying the children to the Aquatic 
Corp Headquarters in Brasilia. 

“They are just tired,” Juao said. 
“They should not have stayed up 
so late last night. Get on the bus 
now. Say good-by to Tio Cal.” 
“Good-by.” 

“Good-by.” 

Kids are never their most crea- 
tive in that sort of situation. And 
I suspect that my godchildren may 
just have been suffering their first 
(or one of their first) hangovers. 
They had been very quiet all morn- 
ing.

I bent down and gave them a 
duansy hug. “When you come back 
on your first weekend off, I’ll take 
you exploring down below at the 
point. You’ll be able to gather your 
own coral now.” 

Juao’s sister got teary, cuddled 
the children, cuddled me, Juao, 
then got on the bus. 

Someone was shouting out the 
window for someone else at the 
bus stop not to forget something as 
they trundled around the square 
and then toward the highway. We 
walked back across the street where 
the cafe owners were putting out 
canvas chairs. 

“I will miss them,” he said, like 
a long-considered admission. 

“You and me both.” At the docks 
near the hydrofoil wharf where the 
submarine launches went out to the 
undersea cities, we saw a crowd. “I 
wonder if they had any trouble lay- 
ing the — ” 

For some reason a woman 
screamed in the crowd. She pushed 
from the others, dropping eggs and 
onions. She must have stopped to 
see what the crowd was about on 
her way back from the market. She 
began to pull her hair and shriek. 
(Remember the skillet of shrimp? 
She had been the woman ladling 
them out.) A few people moved to 
help her. 

A clutch of men broke off and 
ran into the streets of the town. I 
grabbed an amphiman who whirled 
around to face me. 

“What in hell is going on?” 

For a moment his mouth worked 
on his words for all the trite world 
like a beached fish. 



“From the explosion ...” He 
began. “They just brought them 
back from the explosion at the 
Slash!” 

I grabbed his other shoulder. 
“What happened!” 

“About two hours ago. They 
were just a quarter of the way 
through, when the whole fault gave 
way. They had a God-damn under- 
water volcano for half an hour. 
They’re still getting seismic dis- 
turbances.” 

Juao was running toward the 
launch. I pushed the guy away and 
limped after Ihim, struck the crowd 
and jostled through calico, canvas 
and green scales. 

They were carrying the corpses 
out of the hatch of the submarine 
and laying them on a green can- 
vas spread across the dock. They 
still return bodies to the countries 
of birth for the family to decide 
the method of burial. When the 
fault had given, the hot slag that 
had belched into the steaming sea 
was mostly molten silicon. 

Three of the bodies were only 
slightly burned here and there. 
From their bloated faces (one sdll 
bled from the ear) I guessed they 
had died from sonic concussion. 
Several of the bodies were almost 
totally encased in dull, black glass. 

“Tork — ” I kept asking. “Is 
one of them Tork?” 

It took me forty-five minutes, 
asking first the guys who were car- 
rying the bodies, then going into the 
launch and asking some guy with a 
clipboard, and then going back on 
the dock and into the office to find 
out that one of the more unrecog-

nizaible bcxiies, yes, was Tork. 

J uao brought me a glass of but- 
termilk in a cafe on the square. 
He sat still a long time, then finally 
rubbed away his white mustache, 
released the chair wrung with his 
toes, put his hands on his knees. 
“What are you thinking about?” 
“That it’s time to go fix the nets. 
Tomorrow morning I will fish.” He 
regarded me a moment. “Where 
should I fish tomorrow. Cal?” 

“Are you wondering about . 
well, sending the kids off today?” 
He shrugged. “Fishermen from 
this village have drowned. Still it is 
a village of fishermen. Where 
should I fish?” 

I finished my buttermilk. “The 
mineral content over the Slash 
should be high as the devil. Lots of 
algae will gather tonight. Lots of 
small fish down deep. Big fish hov- 
ering over.” 

He nodded. “Good. I will take 
the boat out there tomorrow.” 

We. got up. 

“See you, Juao.” 

I limped back to the beach. 

V 

T ^he fog had unsheathed the sand 
by ten. I walked around, pok- 
ing in clumps of weeds with a stick, 
banging the same stick on my numb 
leg. When I lurched up to the top 
of the rocks, I stopped in the still 
grass. “Ariel?” 

She was kneeling in the water, 
head down, her red hair breaking 
over the sealed gills. Her shoulders 
shook, stilled, shook again. 
DRIFTGLASS 



“Ariel?” I came down over the 
blistered stones. 

She turned away to look at the 
ocean. 

Tlie attachments of children are 
so important and so brittle. “How 
long have you been sitting here?” 

She looked at me now, the varied 
waters of her face stilled on drawn 
cheeks. And her face was exhaust- 
ed. She shook her head. 

Sixteen? Who was the psycholo- 
gist a hundred years back, in the 
seventies who decided that “ado- 
lescents” were just physical and 
mental adults with no useful work? 
“You want to come up to the 
house?” 

The head shaking got faster, 
then stopped. 

After a while I said, “I guess 
they’ll be sending Turk’s body back 
to Manila.” 

He didn’t have a family,” she ex- 
plained. “He’ll be buried here, at 
sea.” 

“Oh,” I said. 

And the rough volcanic glass, 
pulled across the ocean’s sands, 
changing shape, dulling — 

“You were — you liked Tork a 
lot, didn’t you?” I asked. “You kids 
looked like you were pretty fond 
of each other.” 

“Yes. He was an awfully nice 
— ” Then she caught my meaning 
and blinked. “No,” she said. “Oh, 
no. I was — I was engaged to 
Jonni . the brown-haired boy 
from California? Did you meet him 
at the party last night? We’re both 
from Los Angeles, but we only met 
down here. And now . they’re 
sending his body back this evening.”

Her eyes got very wide then closed. 

“I’m sorry.” 

That’s it, you clumsy crippled, 
stepping all over everybody’s emo- 
tions. You look in that mirror and 
you’re too busy looking at what 
might have been to see what is. 

“I’m sorry, Ariel.” 

S he opened her eyes and began 
to look around her. 

“Come on up to the house and 
have an avocado. I mean, they 
have avocados in now, not at the 
supermarket. But at the old town 
market on the other side. And 
they’re better than any they grow 
in California. 

She kept looking around. 

“None of the amphimen get over 
there. It’s a shame, because soon 



the market will probably close, and 
some of their fresh foods are really 
great. Oil and vinegar is all you 
need on them.” I leaned back on 
the rocks. “Or a cup of tea?” 
“Okay.” She remembered to 
smile. I know the poor kid didn’t 
feel like it. “Thank you. I won’t 
be able to stay long, though.” 

We walked back up the rocks to- 
ward the house, the sea on our left. 
Just as we reached the patio, she 
turned and looked back. “Cal?” 
“Yes? What is it?” 

“Those clouds over there, across 
the water. Those are the only ones 
in the sky. Are they from the erup- 
tion in the Slash?” 

I squinted. “I think so. Come on 
inside.”

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

As a sociolo^st and science fic- 
tioneer, I find Mr. Lin Carter's dis- 
cussions of fandom disturbing. To 
paraphrase a recent Jewish intel- 
lectual, I must take odds with Mr. 
Carter and expostulate that fan 
magazines are not only predomin- 
ately anti-intellectual, but their 
cataleptic headache powders of friv- 
olous “fannishness" are guaranteed 
not to activate the social conscience, 
elevate the blood pressure, or agi- 
tate the colon. In short, as one who 
has closely studied fandom as a sub- 
culture as observer and participant 
(under a deliberate nom de plume), 
I feel that Mr. Carter's exuberance 
is merely a misconception — he is 
nurturing an ethnocentrism which is 
so typical of the non-science-fiction 
magazine in fandom. 

It is important for the sociologist 
dealing with fan magazines to dif- 
ferentiate between stated purposes 
and purposes which actually mani- 
fest themselves. The reason is sim- 
ple. Purposes and results, in fan 
magazines, are hardly analoigous. 
For example, this researcher found 
in 25 fan magazines statements to 
the effect that the editors were 
•definitely interested in analytical 
critics and discussions which, sad to 



say, most ^‘fans" (as differentiated 
from science-fiction readers) have 
completely ignored; e.g., discusaionsi 
of the sort as represented by the 
writings of the fan-sociologist Ste- 
phen Pickering, or the editorial by 
Lester del Rey, or the critiques by 
Alexei Panshin or Leland Sapiro. 
However, Mr. Carter need hardly 
ignore the anti-dntellectualism of 
most fan magazines. Such state- 
ments on the editors' part are hard- 
ly necessary. The contents of the 
magazines are sufficient examples 
of anti-intellectualism. Most fans 
publish magazines not to discuss and 
explore intellectually stimulating 
ideas, but to sustain a nurtured 
“fannish" (i.e., immature individ- 
uals) status and role. Hence,' I feel 
Mr. Carter's column is worthless: 
he is ignoring, completely and irre- 
vocably, manifest and latent func- 
tions. That is, Mr. Carter is ignor- 
ing functions which are anticipated, 
and those which are neither intend- 
ed nor recognized. 

The job of differentiating between 
manifest and latent functions is, of 
course, a task which most science- 
fiction writers claim to have done, 
but which few actually do. Never- 
theless, for all of the talk of fan 
magazines being representative of 



159 





an the ordinary” individual, 

it is painfuiHy ostensible, from the 
reading of any '^fannisih” magazine, 
that moe^ fans are very poor, ignor- 
ant sodai critics; most are not in- 
tellectiials, cmd most are highly re- 
sistant to actual changes in ideas. 
The significance of latent and mani- 
fest fimctions lies in the fact that 
it enables one to systematically an- 
alyze fan maigazines, fans and their 
shoitoomings. By examining what 
Merton 'has called “seemingly irra- 
tional social patterns,” it is quite 
probable that the sociologist can as- 
similate and analyze various ethno- 
centrisms of fandom. And the per- 
sistence of anti-intellectualism is 
merely a vindication of the worth- 
less nature of so many fan maga- 
zines. 

I suggest titat Mr. Carter do a 
little more studying, and a little less 
excited chatter, in order to present 
a mature picture to, hoplefully, the 
mature audience of Mr. PohFs mag- 
azines. — Leslie A. Reece, 46 Wain-

Dear Editor: 

I just want to let you know that, 
in my opinion, you are the best sf 
magazine around. With stories like 
The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Neu- 
tron Star land Skylark DuQuesne, 
how can you be beat? 

I remember a story, a long short 
story or a short novelette, that 
involved an invader from outer 
space. There was an astronomer, 
I think, who discovered a body en- 
tering the Solar System that would 
destroy the earth. It had a satellite 
that would be retained by the sun 
after Terra’s demise. The plan was 
to go over to the satellite by space- 
ship and thus save some of the 
human race. It ended right after 



they landed on the satellite and saw 
a road stretching into the distance. 
I wonder if someone would tell me 
the name, author and/or if there 
was a sequel. 

Congratulations on your Hugo. —

Dear Editor: 

My sincerest apologies to Brother 
Ron Smith in the December ish. 
Unfortunately, I was not aware 
that another one of Mr. Plachta’s 
little gems was going to be pre- 
sented in the same issue with my 
letter. However, I have a little con- 
solation : at least the two stories 
are both by the same author. 

However, I hope Brother Smith 
will note my prophetic prediction 
in my same letter. In it, I said that 
I felt that it was high time IP 
received a Hugo. Well, shades of 
Klonos, what happens at the World 
SF-Con but that best of all maga- 
zines, IF, pops up and wins the 
Hugo for best pro magazine? If 
that isn’t psi, what is? 

The stories that you've been fea- 
turing in IF lately have been show- 
ing a slow but upgrading as to 
quality. Of course a few clinkers 
do slip in occasionally, but that hap- 
pens in the best of magazines. Then, 
on the plus side, some of the really 
good stories, Hugo material, have 
been appearing regularly. Keep up 
the good work! 

I am still crusading, as always, 
for better exterior and to a lesser 
degree, interior art. Those horrible 
atrocities that have been gettilig 
out on your covers are giving the 
prospective buyers a false impres- 



160 



IF 




sion of what is inside. Since this 
is the end of the year, a little bit 
of review might be in order. The 
real clunker in cover art appeared 
on (have to let my computer warm 
up here) bop, zing popapop here 
it is: the April and May IFs and 
the January ’66 Worlds of Tomor- 
row. Your best efforts, as usual 
come from Galaxy. The April and 
December covers deserve awards for 
possibly the best cover art of the 
year in sf-dom. The December cov- 
er especially, for its realistic por- 
trayal of a Door Traveler. I’ve been 
debating with myself for a long 
time : is that figure a photo or not? 
It seems so lifelike.If you can make 
the cover art on Galaxy so good, 
how come the art on IF’s and WOT’s 
covers are always so mediocre or 
just plain bad? How about some 
more Morrow and Emsh and Finlay 
doing the interior? These three can 
really wield a pen. 

I read in WOT where Galaxy is 
planning to put out another maga- 
zine. This puzzled me muchly as I 
was afraid that WOT was going 
to be taken off the stands. You 
didn’t help it much when WOT was 
left out of the Christmas package 
advertisement in Galaxy. It was the 
first time in three years that there 
wasn’t an ad for WOT. However, 
with this new news, I suppose I can 
rest safely. Since you are contin- 
uing WOT. I suppose the Moskowitz 
articles and the Philip J. Farmer 
Riverworld series will also continue 
with it. By the way, how many more 
Riverworld stories are there? And 
is there any paperback or hardback 
publication planned soon? 

I’m glad to see that IF is get- 
ting some of the big names in sf 
back that haven’t been putting out 
lately. Like Asimov, who has to be 
one of the greatest ever. And your 



March issue sounds like it may win 
a Hugo itself. 

That other magazine that is in 
the making, will you by any chance 
edit it yourself? If you do, I feel 
that you might be spreading your- 
self a little thin. After all, not even 
Hugo Gernsback ever managed four 
magazines at the same time! You 
might achieve the same effect if 
you added more pages to the three 
Galaxy magazines, improve the for- 
mat and just use the money for the 
4th magazine to improve the now- 
existing three. 

Congratulations on what has to 
be the biggest discovery of a sf 
writer in the sixties! Who? Larry 
Niven, of course. Outside of Philip 
K. Dick, there isn’t ansrone who is 
as prolific as Niven. Nearly every 
magazine on the stands has one of 
his stories. Happily, most of them 
have appeared in your magazines. 
Niven’s work is plausible, sensible, 
and most of all, scientifically cor- 
rect. Which isn’t an oddity today in 
what might be called “The Science 
Conscious Age of SF,” but is still 
rare enough that it makes his stor- 
ies stand out. Keep him with you 
and without a doubt, he will make 
it as big, if not bigger than Keith 
Laumer and the notoriously, famous 
Retief. 

One more thing. My friend in 
Houston, Texas, who is president 
of the local sf club, would like to 
invite any interested fan in the 
Houston area to contact him so 
they can get in on the sf-ly doings 
of the Houston Science Fiction So- 
ciety. Contact Randy Richmond at 
10502 Shadow Wood Drive. — ^Drake

Winning that Hugo must have

inspired the staff to even greater 
efforts at improving If, It makes 
Galaxy seem stale and repetitious 
in comparison. (Jack Vance's Palace 
of Love was a pallid disappoint- 
ment.) The special March issue was 
excellent. Even the art work has 
been a bit better. 

Compliments to prolific Larry 
Niven for all that quality hard SF 
he's been producing. Algis Budry's 
Iron Thom was colorful but ended 
poorly. Please dissuade Keith Lau- 
mer from writing Retief stories 
for a while. 

If you're really going to start an 
‘‘Idea Mart," may I submit a long- 
cherished premise? Why doesn't 
someone base an alternate history 
series on the absence of Mohammed? 
This single difference could have 
drastically changed our world. For 
instance, picture western civiliza- 
tion today had Europe been spared 
centuries of barbaric isolation dur- 
ing the Dark Ages. Such specula- 
tions comprise the celebrated Pir- 
enne Thesis. This has been the sub- 
ject of many scholarly publications 
which would aid the author in his 
extrapolations. At the risk of start- 
ing an argument, may I suggest 
that ihistory provides a better back- 
ground for enjoying SF than 
science? But then I'm prejudiced, 
being a medievalist. — Sandra L.

Dear Fred; 

I have a question which has me 
on the roi>es. It comes from a Wash- 
ington reader who remembers read- 
ing The First Men in the Moon as 
it appeared in the Strand Magazine 
in his early teens, and it has to do 
with what I thought was an H. G. 
Wells story called The Anticipator, 
But I have just been through the 



20 volume edition of Wells in the 
local library and can't find it. 

The story I , remember is about 
two authors, one of whom finds that 
another always beats him to the 
publishers with new ideas. So he 
plans to kill him, but of course is 
anticipated even in this. I remem- 
ber that the last sentence contains 
the phrase, “The anticipator, hor- 
ribly afraid" — referring to the 
murderer as he runs away from the 
scene of the crime. 

I leave for England next week 
and will tackle some Wells experts 
there. If you solve the mystery per- 
haps you would write me. — Arthur 
C. Clarke. 

O Anybody got the answer? We’ll 
pass it on to Clarke . always pro- 
viding we can locate him as he jets 
about the world, tying up the loose 
ends on his forthcoming spectacular 
movie called 2001 : A Space Odyssey, 

And that ties up most of our own 
loose ends this month. We're hoping 
to jet partway around the world in 
a few weeks to visit the city of 
Trieste and take in their V Festival 
Intemazionale del Film di Fanta- 
scienza — fifth annual science-fic- 
tion film festival, that is. It runs 
from July 8th to 15th; looks in- 
teresting, and we'll let you know 
what turns up when we get back. 
Meanwhile, if you happen to find 
yourself in the vicinity of the Jugo- 
lav-Italian border around then, why 
not drop in? 

It's been a while since we men- 
tioned it, but we're still running at 
least one “first" story in every is- 
sue — that's to say, a first appear- 
ance by someone who has never sold 
a science-fiction story before. This 
month's is Family Loyalty by Stan 
Elliott. Next month — 

Well, why not come around next 
month and see? — The Editor
