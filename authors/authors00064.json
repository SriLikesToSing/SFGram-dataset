Together they authored several humorous short novels in the so-called \"Psi-Power\" series: Brain Twister (1962), The Impossibles (1963), and Supermind (1963). For Brain Twister they were nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960 (under the novel's original title, \"That Sweet Little Old Lady\").
