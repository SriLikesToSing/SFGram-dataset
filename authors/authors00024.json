    "bio": "Leonard, the fifth of seven children of Cicero and Getha Leonard, was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was named after Ray Charles, his mother's favorite singer. The family moved to Washington, D.C., when he was three, and they settled permanently in Palmer Park, Maryland when he was ten. His father worked as a supermarket night manager and his mother was a nurse. He attended Parkdale High School, Leonard was a shy child, and aside from the time he nearly drowned in a creek during a flood in Seat Pleasant, Maryland, his childhood was uneventful. He stayed home a lot, reading comic books and playing with his dog. His mother said: \"He never did talk too much. We never could tell what he was thinking. But I never had any problems with him. I never had to go to school once because of him.\" ",

    "summary": "Ray Charles Leonard (born May 17, 1956), best known as \"Sugar\" Ray Leonard, is an American former professional boxer, motivational speaker, and occasional actor. Often regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, he competed from 1977 to 1997, winning world titles in five weight divisions; the lineal championship in three weight divisions; as well as the undisputed welterweight title. Leonard was part of \"The Fabulous Four\", a group of boxers who all fought each other throughout the 1980s, consisting of himself, Roberto Dur\u00e1n, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler.\n\"The Fabulous Four\" created a wave of popularity in the lower weight classes that kept boxing relevant in the post-Muhammad Ali era, during which Leonard defeated future fellow International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees Hearns, Dur\u00e1n, Hagler, and Wilfred Ben\u00edtez. Leonard was also the first boxer to earn more than $100 million in purses, and was named \"Boxer of the Decade\" in the 1980s. The Ring magazine named him Fighter of the Year in 1979 and 1981, while the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA) named him Fighter of the Year in 1976, 1979, and 1981.",
