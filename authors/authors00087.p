VBernadette Hall MNZM (born 1945 in Alexandra, New Zealand) is a New Zealand writer and poet. She was raised in what she describes as a small-city Catholic community that was proud, theatrical and pretty much enclosed. After a career as a teacher of Latin and classical studies she started writing full-time in her forties. She has held residencies at both Canterbury University and Victoria University and is widely published. She spent 10 years as the editor of Takahe magazine and five as the poetry editor of The Press, Christchurch's main daily newspaper.\u000aHall's The Lustre Jug is a finalist in the 2010 New Zealand Post Book Awards.
