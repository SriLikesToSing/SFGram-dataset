    "summary": "Henry Beam Piper (March 23, 1904 \u2013 c.\u2009November 6, 1964) was an American science fiction author. He wrote many short stories and several novels. He is best known for his extensive Terro-Human Future History series of stories and a shorter series of \"Paratime\" alternate history tales.\nHe wrote under the name H. Beam Piper. Another source gives his name as \"Horace Beam Piper\" and a different date of death. His gravestone says \"Henry Beam Piper\". Piper himself may have been the source of part of the confusion; he told people the H stood for Horace, encouraging the assumption that he used the initial because he disliked his name. On a copy of \"Little Fuzzy\" given to Charles O. Piper, Beam's cousin and executor, he wrote \"To Charles from Henry.\"",
