VSonya Dorman (1924 \u2013 February 14, 2005) was the working name of Sonya Dorman Hess. She was born in New York City in 1924 and died in Taos, New Mexico on February 14, 2005 at the age of 80.\u000aShe is perhaps best known outside of the world of science fiction as a poet. One of her poems, however, Corruption of Metals, received honors within science fiction circles by winning the Rhysling Award of the Science Fiction Poetry Association. Her best-known work of science fiction is the story "When I Was Miss Dow", which has been reprinted numerous times and received a James Tiptree, Jr. retrospective award nomination.\u000aShe also appeared in Harlan Ellison's anthology Dangerous Visions, with the story "Go, Go, Go, Said the Bird."
