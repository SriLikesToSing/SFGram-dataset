VAndrés Chabrillón (anglicised as Andres Chabrillon, 20 September 1887\u20141968) was an Argentine poet, writer, lecturer and literature professor of French descent.\u000aChabrillón was born in Paraná, Entre Ríos, and later lived in Buenos Aires.\u000aHe travelled widely across Europe and the Americas. In 1911 he published his first book of poems, entitled "A la luz de una sombra" ("Under a shadow's light").\u000aHe is considered one of the advanced poets of the creationism movement that was initiated with Vicente Huidobro and Pierre Reverdy. He handled the historical, the specific, the picturesque, the artificial, and sometimes he took for himself some elements of symbolism, of the Parnaso and those of decadentism (basic components of his revolutionary formula). As Mastronardi would do in the next movement, Chabrillón pioneered the modernist "Kermesse porteña" in a very "entrerrianian" way.\u000aHe belonged to the group of Bohemians who would meet at the Café de los Inmortales in Buenos Aires.\u000aEvaristo Carriego, Ghiraldo, Álvaro Melián Lafinur, Enrique Banchs, Juan Pedro Calou, Roberto F. Giusti, Alfredo Bianchi, Juan Pablo Echagüe, Hugo de Achával, Natalio Botana, Alberto Gerchunoff, Charles de Soussens, Roberto J. Payró, Luis Doello Jurado, Edmundo Montagne, Bernardo González Arrili, Domingo Robatto, Héctor Pedro Blomberg, Federico Carlando, Juan Francisco Palerino, Fernán Félix de Amador and the viscount Emilio de Lascano Tegui were some of the poets and writers that used to share their time with Chabrillón.\u000aHe graduated as an Attorney in 1913 from the Faculty of Law, University of Buenos Aires. He practiced as a lawyer and judge in the provinces of Entre Ríos and Misiones Province.\u000aIn 1918 he moved to Concordia, Entre Ríos, where he lived until 1962. He then moved to Buenos Aires, where he spent the last few years of his life until his death in 1968.
