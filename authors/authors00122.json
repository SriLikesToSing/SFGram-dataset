After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, he served with the United States Army in Europe during World War II, an experience that formed the basis for his 1960 novel The Beardless Warriors. After returning home, he attended the Missouri School of Journalism at the University of Missouri, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949. Afterward, he moved to California.  In 1952, Matheson married Ruth Ann Woodson, whom he met in California. They had four children. Bettina Mayberry, Richard Christian Matheson, Chris Matheson and Ali Matheson.\nRichard Christian, Chris and Ali became writers of fiction and screenplays.\nMatheson died on June 23, 2013 at his home in Los Angeles, California, aged 87.",
