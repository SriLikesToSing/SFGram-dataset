    "summary": "Neil Ronald Jones (May 29, 1909 \u2013 February 15, 1988) was an American author who worked for the state of New York. Not prolific, and little remembered today, Jones was ground-breaking in science fiction. His first story, \"The Death's Head Meteor\", was published in Air Wonder Stories in 1930, possibly recording the first use of \"astronaut\" in fiction. He also pioneered cyborg and robotic characters, and is credited with inspiring the modern idea of cryonics. Most of his stories fit into a \"future history\" like that of Robert A. Heinlein or Cordwainer Smith, well before either of them used this convention in their fiction.",
