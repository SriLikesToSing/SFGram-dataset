    "bio": "Farmer was born in North Terre Haute, Indiana. According to colleague Frederik Pohl, his middle name was in honor of an aunt, Josie. Farmer grew up in Peoria, Illinois, where he attended Peoria High School. His father was a civil engineer and a supervisor for the local power company. A voracious reader as a boy, Farmer said he resolved to become a writer in the fourth grade. He became an agnostic at the age of 14. At age 23, in 1941, he married and eventually fathered a son and a daughter. After washing out of flight training in World War II, he went to work in a local steel mill. He continued his education, however, earning a bachelor's degree in English from Bradley University in 1950.\nFarmer had his first literary success when his novella The Lovers was published by Samuel Mines in Startling Stories, August 1952. It features a sexual relationship between a human and an extraterrestrial and he won the next Hugo Award as \"most promising new writer\" (his first of three Hugos). Thus encouraged, he quit his job to become a full-time writer, entered a publisher's contest, and promptly won the $4,000 first prize for a novel, Owe for the Flesh, that contained the germ of his later Riverworld series. But the book was not published and Farmer did not get the money. Literary success did not translate into financial security so he left Peoria in 1956 to launch a career as a technical writer. He spent the next 14 years working in that capacity for various defense contractors, from Syracuse, New York to Los Angeles, while writing science fiction in his spare time.\nHe won a second Hugo for the 1967 novella Riders of the Purple Wage, a pastiche of James Joyce\u2019s Finnegans Wake as well as a satire on a futuristic, cradle-to-grave welfare state. Reinvigorated, Farmer became a full-time writer again in 1969. Upon moving back to Peoria in 1970, he entered his most prolific period, publishing 25 books in 10 years. His novel To Your Scattered Bodies Go (a reworked, previously unpublished version of the prize-winning first novel of 20 years before) won him his third Hugo in 1971. A 1975 novel, Venus on the Half-Shell, created a stir in the larger literary community and media. It purported to be written in the first person by one \u201cKilgore Trout,\u201d a fictional character appearing as an underappreciated science fiction writer in several of Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s novels. The escapade did not please Vonnegut when some reviewers not only concluded that it had been written by Vonnegut himself, but that it was a worthy addition to his works. Farmer did have permission from Vonnegut to write the book, though Vonnegut later said he regretted giving permission.\nFarmer had both critical champions and detractors. Leslie Fiedler proclaimed him \"the greatest science fiction writer ever\" and lauded his approach to storytelling as a \u201cgargantuan lust to swallow down the whole cosmos, past, present and to come, and to spew it out again.\u201d Isaac Asimov praised Farmer as an \"excellent science fiction writer; in fact, a far more skillful writer than I am....\" But Christopher Lehmann-Haupt dismissed him in The New York Times in 1972 as \"a humdrum toiler in the fields of science fiction.\"\nIn 2001 Farmer won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and the Science Fiction Writers of America made him its 19th SFWA Grand Master in the same year.\nFarmer died on February 25, 2009.  At the time of his death, he and his wife Bette had two children, five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.",

    "summary": "Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer (January 26, 1918 \u2013 February 25, 2009) was an American author known for his science fiction and fantasy novels and short stories.\nFarmer is best known for his sequences of novels, especially the World of Tiers (1965\u201393) and Riverworld (1971\u201383) series. He is noted for the pioneering use of sexual and religious themes in his work, his fascination for, and reworking of, the lore of celebrated pulp heroes, and occasional tongue-in-cheek pseudonymous works written as if by fictional characters. Farmer often mixed real and classic fictional characters and worlds and real and fake authors as epitomized by his Wold Newton family group of books. These tie all classic fictional characters together as real people and blood relatives resulting from an alien conspiracy. Such works as The Other Log of Phileas Fogg (1973) and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life (1973) are early examples of literary mashup.\nLiterary critic Leslie Fiedler compared Farmer to Ray Bradbury as both being \"provincial American eccentrics\" who \"strain at the classic limits of the [science fiction] form,\" but found Farmer distinctive in that he \"manages to be at once naive and sophisticated in his odd blending of theology, pornography, and adventure.\"",
