VHomer Eon Flint (bornas Homer Eon Flindt; 1888 \u20131924) was an American writer of pulp science fiction novels and stories.\u000aHe began working as a scenarist for silent films (reportedly at his wife's insistence) in 1912. In 1918 he published "The Planeteer" in All-Story Weekly. His "Dr. Kinney" stories were reprinted by Ace Books in 1965, and with Austin Hall he co-wrote the novel The Blind Spot.\u000aReportedly he died as a result of an involvement in a bank robbery attempt. According to his granddaughter the only witness was himself a gangster.\u000aHis son was Max Hugh Flindt (1915-2004), co-founder of the ancient astronaut society who co-authored with Otto Binder Mankind \u2013 Child of the Stars in 1974, and in 2004 published Between the Apes and the Angels.
