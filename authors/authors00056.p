VHe married Agnes Kuchenberg on April 13, 1929, and they had two children, Richard (Dick) Scott (1947\u20132012) and Shelley Ellen. In a blurb in Time and Again he wrote, "I have been happily married to the same woman for thirty three years and have two children. My favorite recreation is fishing (the lazy way, lying in a boat and letting them come to me). Hobbies: Chess, stamp collecting, growing roses." He dedicated the book to his wife Kay, "without whom I'd never have written a line". He was well liked by many of his science fiction-writing friends, especially Isaac Asimov. He died in Minneapolis on 25 Apr 1988.
