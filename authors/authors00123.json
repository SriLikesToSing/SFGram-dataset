    "bio": "Henry Kuttner was born in Los Angeles, California in 1915. Naphtaly Kuttner (1829\u20131903) and Amelia Bush (c. 1834\u20131911), the parents of his father, the bookseller Henry Kuttner (1863\u20131920), had come from Leszno in Prussia and lived in San Francisco since 1859; the parents of his mother, Annie Levy (1875\u20131954), were from Great Britain. Henry Kuttner's great-grandfather was the scholar Josua Heschel Kuttner. Kuttner grew up in relative poverty following the death of his father. As a young man he worked for the literary agency of his uncle, Laurence D'Orsay (in fact his first cousin per marriage), in Los Angeles before selling his first story, \"The Graveyard Rats\", to Weird Tales in early 1936.\nAlfred Bester told this anecdote about Kuttner: \"Mort Weisinger introduced me to the informal luncheon gatherings of the working science fiction authors of the late thirties. I met Henry Kuttner\", whom Bester described as \"medium-sized\", \"very quiet and courteous, and entirely without outstanding features. Once I broke Kuttner up quite unintentionally. I said to Weisinger, 'I've just finished a wild story that takes place in a spaceless, timeless locale where there's no objective reality. It's awfully long, 20,000 words, but I can cut the first 5,000.' Kuttner burst out laughing.\" Henry Kuttner was born in Los Angeles, California in 1915.
