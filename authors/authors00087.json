She has held residencies at both Canterbury University and Victoria University and is widely published. She spent 10 years as the editor of Takahe magazine and five as the poetry editor of The Press, Christchurch's main daily newspaper.\nHall's The Lustre Jug is a finalist in the 2010 New Zealand Post Book Awards.",
