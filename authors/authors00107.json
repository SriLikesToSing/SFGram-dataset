    "summary": "Pierre Benoit (16 July 1886 \u2013 3 March 1962) was a French novelist and member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.\nPierre Benoit, born in Albi (southern France) was the son of a French soldier. Benoit spent his early years and military service in Northern Africa, before becoming a civil servant. His first novel, Koenigsmark, was published in 1918; L'Atlantide was published the next year and was awarded the Grand Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. Benoit became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie in 1931.\nA political right-winger, Benoit was an admirer of the French fascist Charles Maurras. During the Nazi Occupation of France, Beno\u00eet joined the \"Groupe Collaboration\", a pro-Nazi arts group whose other members included Abel Bonnard, Georges Claude and Pierre Drieu La Rochelle. This led him to be arrested in September 1944; he was eventually released after six months, but his work remained on the \"blacklist\" of French Nazi collaborators for several years afterwards.\nLate in his life, Benoit gave a series of interviews with the French writer Paul Guimard.\nHe died in March 1962 in Ciboure.",
