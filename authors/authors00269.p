VWilliams lived in Houston until 1980 when his family moved east and settled in Lufkin, Texas. Following high school, Williams spent four years in neighboring Nacogdoches, Texas playing in several bands. One of the most popular bands, Fives a Crowd, was a rock cover band that gained a substantial following before splitting up in late 1992. At this time Williams made his first trip to Nashville, Tennessee and recorded his first studio recording session at Oak Hill Studios with Kevin McManus. A brief return to Nacogdoches saw Fives a Crowd reconstructed into a country band and Williams played with them before the band relocated to the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Williams was previously married and has two daughters. He married Melinda Duncan in May 2007 at the Key West Songwriters Festival. He has two step-children.
