VBorn into a working class family in Broughton, Salford, Lancashire, England, Smith moved to nearby Prestwich early in life. In his autobiography, he claims that Alfred Henry Hook \u2013 a soldier who fought at Rorke's Drift \u2013 was an ancestor of his father, leading to the Smith family being invited as guests of honour to the Whitefield showing of the film Zulu in which Hook was played by James Booth. Originally a Labour supporter, he then joined the Socialist Workers Party.

He comes from Prestwich, near to Manchester.\u000aSmith formed The Fall in 1978 after attending a Sex Pistols gig at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in June 1976. Although hugely talented and charismatic, Smith is famously acerbic and difficult to work with. He has been described as a "a strange kind of antimatter national treasure".\u000a\u000a
