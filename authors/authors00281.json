    "summary": "Donald Keith was a pseudonym for authors Donald (1888\u20131972) and Keith Monroe (1917\u20132003). They are best known for their series of stories in the Time Machine series, which were originally published in Boys' Life magazine between 1959 and 1989. Some of the stories were combined into two books, Mutiny in the Time Machine (1963) and Time Machine to the Rescue (1967).\nA few stories later in the series were written by Keith Monroe alone. The works of Donald Keith were often Keith Monroe's earlier attempts, to which his father, Donald Monroe, helped him. As a result, both men amalgamated their forenames into the pen name \"Donald Keith\" in order to credit both.\nDonald Keith also contributed stories to Galaxy Science Fiction and Blue Book.",
