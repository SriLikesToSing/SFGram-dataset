Hyperspace beacons are made to last forever -- or damn close to it. When one of them breaks down, it is \"never\" an accident, and repairing the thing is never a matter of just plugging in a new part.\"<br /><br />He was telling \"me\" -- the guy who did the job while he sat back on his fat paycheck in an air-conditioned office.",
