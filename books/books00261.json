    "description": "<b>A definitive edition of stories by the master of supernatural fiction</b><br /><br />Howard Phillips Lovecraft's unique contribution to American literature was a melding of traditional supernaturalism (derived chiefly from Edgar Allan Poe) with the genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1920s. This Penguin Classics edition brings together a dozen of the master's tales-from his early short stories \"Under the Pyramids\" (originally ghostwritten for Harry Houdini) and \"The Music of Erich Zann\" (which Lovecraft ranked second among his own favorites) through his more fully developed works, \"The Dunwich Horror,\" The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, and <i>At the Mountains of Madness</i>.<br /><br /><b>\n  <i><b>The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories</b> </i>\n</b>presents the definitive corrected texts of these works, along with Lovecraft critic and biographer S. T. Joshi's illuminating introduction and notes to each story.<br /><br /><br />Contains the following tales:<br />- The Tomb<br />- Beyond the Wall of Sleep<br />- The White Ship<br />- The Temple<br />- The Quest of Iranon<br />- The Music of Erich Zann<br />- Imprisoned with the Pharaohs aka Under the Pyramids<br />- Pickman's Model<br />- The Case of Charles Dexter Ward<br />- The Dunwich Horror<br />- At the Mountains of Madness<br />- The Thing on the Doorstep",
