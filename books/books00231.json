Then a well-connected lawyer is wheeled in, victim of a suspected suicide.<br /><br />One suicide is bad. But when one grows to four in a matter of days, and all the victims are lawyers, the trend stops being an oddity and becomes a real problem.<br /><br />Were these really suicides? Why would successful, hot young lawyers want to kill themselves? <br /><br />Then Molly unearths secrets that powerful people don\u2019t want exposed and the puzzle suddenly becomes a threat. Now she must find killer, or become the next victim.",

    "summary": "Mad in America: Bad Science, Bad Medicine, and the Enduring Mistreatment of the Mentally Ill is a 2002 book by medical journalist Robert Whitaker, in which he examines and questions the efficacy, safety, and ethics of past psychiatric interventions for severe mental illnesses, particularly antipsychotics. The book is organized as a historical timeline of treatment development in the United States.\nMad in America received positive reviews from the general public and mixed reviews from the medical community, which criticized some bias in sourcing but nonetheless acknowledged the need to address the critical questions raised by the book regarding modern psychiatry.\n\n",
