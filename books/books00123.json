    "description": "<b>The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife, one of the best romance books of all time, is now available as an eBook!</b><br /><br />Audrey Niffenegger's dazzling debut is the story of Clare, a beautiful, strong-minded art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: his genetic clock randomly resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity from his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous and unpredictable, and lend a spectacular urgency to Clare and Henry's unconventional love story. That their attempt to live normal lives together is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control makes their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.<br /><br /><b>Plus, the long-awaited sequel to Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s time-traveling love story is finally here!</b><br /><br />The ebook includes the first 25 pages of Niffeneger\u2019s sequel featuring Henry and Clare\u2019s daughter, Alba. Gifted with Clare\u2019s beauty and Henry\u2019s unique abilities, Alba finds herself caught between her real-time husband, Zach, and her other husband, Oliver, a fellow time-traveler and musician.<br /><br />Get your eBook today and dive into this classic romance novel.
