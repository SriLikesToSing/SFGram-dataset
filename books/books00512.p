V<b>\u201cI\u2019ve had a most amazing time....\u201d</b><br /><br />So begins the Time Traveller\u2019s astonishing firsthand account of his journey 800,000 years beyond his own era\u2014and the story that launched H.G. Wells\u2019s successful career and earned him his reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine\u2019s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.� There he discovers two bizarre races\u2014the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks\u2014who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.� Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells\u2019s expert storytelling and provocative insight, <b>The Time Machine</b> will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.<br /><br />

sS'summary'
p85
VThe Rim of the Unknown is a collection of 23 stories by author Frank Belknap Long. It was published by Arkham House in 1972 with cover art by Herb Arnold and was the author's second collection of stories published by Arkham House. It was published in an edition of 3,650 copies.\u000aThe collection focusses primarily on Long's science fiction work in short form. While there is one tale ("The Man with a Thousand Legs") which appeared in Weird Tales, the other stories are reprinted from such sources as Science Fiction Plus, Thrilling Wonder Stories, Startling Stories, Astounding Science Fiction, and Fantastic Universe.\u000aThe rear flap of the book credits Long with having written various other works including the fugitive The Mystery of the Golden Butterfly. The latter appears to have been an Ellery Queen novel which remained unpublished, although it is known that Long was the author of two other Queen novels - The Golden Eagle Mystery (1942) and The Green Turtle Mystery (1944).
