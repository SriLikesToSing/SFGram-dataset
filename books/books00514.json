    "description": "Jo Atkins\u2019 sixteenth year was disastrous: she lost her dad, was assaulted by a stranger, and then had her heart broken. For the last twenty-five years, she\u2019s believed that nothing could ever be as bad again.<br /><br />She was wrong.<br /><br />Now, still smarting from her recent divorce, pretty, self-effacing Jo finally gathers the courage to enter the dating scene. She meets Claudio, whom she vaguely remembers from her youth, but after a few dates decides he\u2019s creepy and politely tells him \u2018thanks but no thanks\u2019.<br /><br />But Claudio has no intention of letting her go.<br /><br />Instead of never seeing him again, Jo wakes up sick and terrified, handcuffed to her own bed. She is given a week to prove her love for Claudio\u2014or he will kill her.<br /><br />Claudio, it turns out, is a man with nothing left to lose.<br /><br /><i>The Venus Trap</i> tackles the emotional impact of divorce, the perils of modern dating and the age-old powers of lust and obsession.",
