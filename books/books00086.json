    "description": "Several novels by H.G. Wells have shown his extraordinary power of vividly realizing the most daringly-imagined conditions. \"The Food of the Gods\" is a surpassing example of these powers; and in it Mr. Wells combines them with a curious but always very telling addition of humor and pathos.",

I had hit upon [the idea] while working out the possibilities of the near future in a book of speculations called Anticipations (1901).\" There have been various B-movie adaptations. The novel is about a group of scientists who invent a food that accelerates the growth of children and turns them into giants when they become adults.",
