    "description": "\"Of course,\" said Mr. Pathis, Carrin's Account Executive from th AE company that supplied -- well, everything, everything the family bought or needed, \"we would not want to deprive you of necessities, which in any case is fully protected by the laws we helped formulate and pass. To say nothing of the terrific items that are coming out next year. Things you wouldn't want to miss, sir!\"<br /><br />Mr. Carrin nodded. Certainly he wanted new items.<br /><br />\"Well, suppose we make the customary arrangement. If you will just sign over your son's earnings for the first thirty years of his adult life, we can easily arrange credit for you.\"<br /><br />Carrin made his payments, even when they were awful. But how could they aswk him to sign away his son's life. . . ?",
