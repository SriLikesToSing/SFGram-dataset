    "description": "First I was a sorcerer. Then I was a hermit. For so long\u2014for years that seemed to go on forever\u2014I couldn't bear to be touched. I put up not just walls but whole stone bunkers to keep everyone out, emotionally, and physically as well. I was protected from people, from ghosts, from specters real and imagined. Sure, I was alone. But I felt safe. Only, after a while, I wasn't sure any longer whether a totally \"safe\" empty life was really worth living.<br />Then Tobin came along. Out of the blue, out of my past, with a summons from the king that he wouldn't let me ignore. I tried to cling to my isolation, but he wouldn't give up on me. Tobin never believed in walls.<br /><br />This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"<b>Love Has No Boundaries</b>\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.<br /><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1351037-nor-iron-bars-a-cage-by-kaje-harper---6-1-download-link-inside\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1...</a>",
