sS'summary'
p67
VThe Gods of Peg\u0101na is the first book by Anglo-Irish fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, published on a commission basis in 1905. The book was reviewed favourably but as an unusual piece. One of the more influential reviews was by Edward Thomas in the London Daily Chronicle.\u000aThe book is a series of short stories linked by Dunsany's invented pantheon of deities who dwell in Peg\u0101na. It was followed by a further collection Time and the Gods and by some stories in The Sword of Welleran and Other Stories and in Tales of Three Hemispheres. In 1919 Dunsany told an American interviewer "In The Gods of Pegana I tried to account for the ocean and the moon. I don't know whether anyone else has ever tried that before".\u000aThe book contains a range of illustrations by Sidney Sime, the originals of all of which can be seen at Dunsany Castle.\u000aAside from its various stand-alone editions, the complete text of the collection is included in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy collection Beyond the Fields We Know (1972), in The Complete Peg\u0101na (1998), and in the Gollancz Fantasy Masterworks omnibus Time and the Gods (2000).
