VIn 1996, just before university, Robert and his best friend Spud hedonistically set off around Europe in their neighbour\u2019s stolen car, with the ï¿½28,000 they have `acquired,\u2019 forged documents, no insurance and class A\u2019s under the bonnet. On the way to the ferry in Hull, they save the life of a young suicidal woman, Naomi, who is about to jump off the Humber Bridge. All her immediate family have tragically died in a car crash one year previous. Robert is adamant he can help rehabilitate her; but Steven wants nothing of this `Captain Freedom\u2019 talk. Along the way they meet a beautiful smack-head \u2013 dance like the rest of the world is watching \u2013 reach a higher state of consciousness - have gratuitous sex \u2013 perpetrate sweet criminal acts \u2013 meet madness and genius \u2013 open the door to hell \u2013 have perfect moments \u2013 cry in the Vatican \u2013 have scary liaisons \u2013 get mortally challenged \u2013 blow things up and see hope boil away. Robert is not looking for love, moral enlightenment or a sense of being, but he gets them anyway\u2026 well\u2026 What more could you want from a book? Hoofing It is the debut novel by Ian M Pindar, it is a rite of passage/coming of age story and the first in a series; the second being Hoofed (set around the millennium) will be out soon. As the main character Robert Knight travels through life, we will travel with him \u2013 hop on board!
