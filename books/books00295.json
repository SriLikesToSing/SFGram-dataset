    "description": "30 Minutes to Live! Joe Kenmore heard the airlock close with a sickening wheeze and then a clank. In desperation he turned toward Haney. \"My God, we've been locked out!\"<br /><br />Through the transparent domes of their space helmets, Joe could see a look of horror and disbelief pass across Haney's face. But it was true! Joe and his crew were locked out of the Space Platform.<br /><br />Four thousand miles below circled the Earth. Under Joe's feet rested the solid steel hull of his home in outer space. But without tools there was no hope of getting back inside. Joe looked at his oxygen meter. It registered thirty minutes to live.<br /><br />*<br /><br />\"Space Tug\" by Murray Leinster is an independent sequel to the author's popular \"Space Platform.\"",

    "summary": "Space Tug is a young adult science fiction novel by author Murray Leinster. It was published in 1953 by Shasta Publishers in an edition of 5,000 copies. It is the second novel in the author's Joe Kenmore series. Groff Conklin gave it a mixed review in Galaxy, noting that it held \"plenty of excitement though not much maturity.\" Boucher and McComas preferred it to the series's initial volume, but still found it \"quite a notch below ; ; ; Leinster's adult work.\" P. Schuyler Miller reported the novel was marked by \"the fastest kind of action\" and \"the feeling of technical authenticity.\"",
