VFollowing events in the first novel, in which Carpenter learned that it is possible to leave Hell, Carpenter wants to help others in the way his benefactor helped him. Carpenter meets and travels through all the circles of the Hell described by Dante. He is accompanied in his travels by Sylvia Plath (whom he rescues from the Wood of the Suicides by burning her tree, causing her physical body to reform itself), attempting to understand the purpose of Hell and free many of the damned. Carpenter discovers that, apparently because he returned to Hell of his own free will to help others, he now possesses powers and abilities such as his mentor, Benito, also displayed.\u000aIn his travels, Carpenter meets many well-known individuals deceased as of 2009. In addition to Plath, some of the notables encountered by Carpenter include:\u000aLester del Rey\u000aAnna Nicole Smith\u000aElse Frenkel-Brunswik\u000aGeorge Lincoln Rockwell\u000aTed Hughes\u000aCharles Francis Adams, Sr.\u000aAlbert Camus\u000aCarl Sagan\u000aSeung-Hui Cho\u000aKenneth Lay\u000aAimee Semple McPherson\u000aPeter Lawford\u000aJ. Edgar Hoover\u000aMelvin Belli\u000aReinhard Heydrich\u000aFrederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell\u000aSir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet\u000aJesse M. Unruh\u000aLeon Trotsky\u000aPontius Pilate\u000aJ. Robert Oppenheimer\u000aFrank Harris\u000aIn the end, and partly as the consequence of some unusual changes to Hell itself, Carpenter not so much escapes as that he is shown the door for being a troublemaker.
