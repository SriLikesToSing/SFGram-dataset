    "description": "\"It seemed Earth was a rich, and undefended planet in a warring, hating galaxy. Things can be deceptive though; children playing can be quite rough -- but that ain't war, friend!\"<br /><br />-- JOHN W. CAMPBELL's \"original blurb for this tale\"<br /><br />*<br /><br />When we first read Campbell's blurb for this novella, we wondered what the devil he (and, after a page or two, del Rey, too) were on about. We were still wondering, halfway through the tale -- until it fell on us, just the way you'd expect it to in a work out of JWC's \"Astounding\"/\"Analog.\" The earth men may \"seem\" to be pathetic numbskulls collecting what they deserve -- but watch them closely. They're on to something.",
