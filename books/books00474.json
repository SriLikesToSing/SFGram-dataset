    "description": "The Professor was congratulating Earth's first visitor from another planet on his wisdom in getting in touch with a cultural anthropologist before contacting any other scientists (or governments, God forbid!), and in learning English from radio and TV before landing from his orbit-parked rocket, when the Martian stood up and said hesitantly, \"Excuse me, please, but where is it?\"<br /><br />He was asking directions to the loo, as it happened. It was the Professor's Wife, always a perceptive hostess, came to her husband's rescue by saying, \"Top of the stairs, end of the hall, last door.\"<br /><br />Oddly enough, it was the start of a puzzling and all but unspeakable misadventure. As it were.",
