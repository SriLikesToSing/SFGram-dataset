    "description": "The American economy is sliding under the rising tide of deficit spending. Can the next generation of Sentinels reverse the downturn? Four years after the bursting of the great consumer debt bubble, the country is dangerously overleveraged and underemployed. The United States is quickly losing its competitive edge against the goods-producing industries of China and India. In an environment of stagnated government leadership, five highly accomplished entrepreneurial leaders step forward. They hope to solve the economic problems by implementing \u201cEmploy American,\u201d a step-by-step strategy designed to restore the competitiveness of American manufacturers. Sovereign governments, offshore manufacturers, foreign oil producers, and domestic power-generating utility companies are threatened by the possible realization of the \u201cEmploy American\u201d plan. Their efforts to prevent the Sentinels from achieving their goal are constantly, menacingly present. A Matter of Importance unfolds through the drama of the evolving lives of each of the principal characters. Romance, fear, victory, and disappointment are never very far away.",
