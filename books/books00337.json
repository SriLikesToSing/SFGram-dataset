And despite their differences, Whitney and Lea have a lot in common: both are navigating a tangled web of relationships, past disappointments and future hopes.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAs things heat up with Will, and her friendship with Whitney deepens, Lea has to decide how much she\u2019s willing to change in order to fit into their world.<br /><br />Lea Lane has lived in between all her life. But it isn\u2019t until her junior year that she learns how to do it on her own terms.",
