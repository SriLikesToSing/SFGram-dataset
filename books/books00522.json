    "description": "When time means nothing, and wishes rule, watch out!<br /><br />The quest for a magical watch lures Nicholas and his father into the land of a cruel King and his brave, bumbling knights. Will naughty wood elves, wily wizards, and giant amphibians put an end to a young boy\u2019s dreams? Father and son fight all with a little help from strange friends. Singing lightbulbs and fierce librarians play a role. Meanwhile, The Watch rules and every creature morphs at its touch.<br /><br />WARNING: <br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not warn readers about the contents of this tale.<br />It is not for everyone.<br /><br />Let me repeat: <br />This tale, The Watch That Could Do Anything, as innocent as it seems on its lovely cover, is not for every reader.<br /><br />First of all, you must be of a certain age to read this book.<br />No less than 9 years of age and no more than 94 years of age.<br /><br />That is my rule.<br /><br />And you know what they say about rules.<br /><br />My second rule: You must, even should you fall within these restricted ages, be of a certain bent of mind. The man of 94 years should \u2013 in at least one quadrant of his mind \u2013 still feel and think much the same as he did when he was 9, while the 9-year old must carry in him some of the wisdom and wit, obstinacy and idiocy of the 94-year old.<br /><br />I must admit that in this meandering tale I have dared to include, through no conscious intent, nearly all that I know about the universe and how to live in it. Specifically, (for that is what all of us want, is it not?) what is peculiar to us as living creatures. I say nearly all that I know, because I do not know all that I know or do not know.<br /><br />There is also a lot foolish word play in this tale. But remember, Readers, words have power. Words can heal, destroy, or mutilate.<br /><br />Finally, I would not call this a dangerous book. Let others do that. Rather, I would say it is a lively book, a book that must be taken with a grain of salt and perhaps, if you are of that sort, a dollop of cranberry cider.<br /><br />Be careful though. <br /><br />If you should read the words contained within the covers of this tale at a particularly sensitive time in your life, there is no telling what might happen.<br /><br />One more caution.<br /><br />Do not . . . <br /><br />I start again. <br /><br />Do not read certain sections of this book after midnight or on the night of a full moon.<br /><br />You\u2019ll have to decide which sections for yourself.<br /><br />After all, I can\u2019t do all the work for you.",

    "summary": "Ogre is a board wargame first released in 1977 as the first Metagaming Concepts Microgame, designed by Steve Jackson. It is an asymmetrical forces game, set in the late 21st century. One player has a single giant robot tank (called an \"Ogre\") pitted against a second player's headquarters, defended by a mixture of conventional tanks, infantry, and artillery. The concept was strongly influenced by Keith Laumer's novel Bolo (1976), and Colin Kapp's short story \"Gottlos\" (1969). The Ogre itself is named after the large and strong mythological beast ogre.\nSince its initial release in 1977 Ogre has been reprinted many times, most recently in 2014. After Jackson founded his own company, Steve Jackson Games, Ogre, its sequel G.E.V., and further expansions were published in the Pocket Box format. On March 8, 2008, Steve Jackson Games announced the planned production of Ogre 6th Edition. In 2012, a new version of Ogre successfully completed funding on Kickstarter.com, for release in November 2012. After multiple delays, the elaborate 29 pound Designer's edition was shipped to all Kickstarter backers in November 2013.\n\n",
