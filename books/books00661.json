    "description": "We've often wondered what would happen if Robert Young should cease to be a lyrically intense writer for a story or two, forsaking the bright poetic worlds of Miss Katy Three and The First Sweet Sleep Of Night to become dispassionately analytical on a cosmic scale. Now we know! He'd chill us to the bone by setting two squixes to brooding over a never-to-be-born Earth, exactly as he's done here. And thrill us, too -- with the liveliest kind of entertainment.<br /><br />Originally published short story from Fantastic Worlds, Sept 1956, now available thru Gutenberg et. al.",
