    "description": "When Kit Temple is drafted for the Nowhere Journey, he figures that he'll leave his home, his girl, and the Earth for good. For although the draftees are always promised \"rotation,\" not a man has ever returned from that mysterious flight into the unknown. Kit's fellow-draftee Arkalion, the young man with the strange, old-man eyes, seems to know more than he should. So when Kit twists the tail of fate and follows Arkalion to the ends of space and time, he finds the secret behind \"Nowhere\" -- and a personal challenge upon which the entire future of Earth depends!",
