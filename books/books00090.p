VRobert E. Howard's Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, or simply Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of, is a sword and sorcery British pen-and-paper role-playing game set in the world of Conan the Barbarian, the fictional Hyborian Age. Both the character and the setting were first imagined by American author Robert E. Howard (1906-1936) as of 1932 and until his suicide in 1936. Howard's original literary work has since spawned a vast franchise of novels, comic books, films, video games, board games, role-playing games, etc. Following this tradition, Conan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of is the third officially licensed Conan role-playing game. The two precedent games were Conan Role-Playing Game (1985-1988) and Conan: The Roleplaying Game (2004-2010), although there also had been supplements for independent generic systems, like GURPS Conan (1988-1989).\u000aConan: Adventures in an Age Undreamed Of was developed by a team of game designers, writers and artists, all led by Chris Birch of Modiphius Entertainment. The rights to publish this derivative work were licensed from Conan Properties International.\u000a\u000a
