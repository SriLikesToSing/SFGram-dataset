    "description": "Aspiring reporter Piper Baird decides to write a scathing expos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd on the overprivileged students at an elite Washington, DC, school, only for her life to change when she begins to fall for the story's main subject, in this new realistic contemporary romance from Brodi Ashton, the author of the Everneath trilogy.<br /><br /><i>Raucous parties, privileged attitudes, underage drinking, and diplomatic immunity...it\u2019s all part of student life on Embassy Row.</i><br /><br />Piper Baird has always dreamed of becoming a journalist. So when she scores a scholarship to exclusive Chiswick Academy in Washington, DC, she knows it\u2019s her big opportunity. Chiswick offers the country\u2019s most competitive prize for teen journalists\u2014the Bennington scholarship\u2014and winning will ensure her acceptance to one of the best schools in the country.<br /><br />Piper isn\u2019t at Chiswick for two days before she witnesses the intense competition in the journalism program\u2014and the extreme privilege of the young and wealthy elite who attend her school. And Piper knows access to these untouchable students just might give her the edge she\u2019ll need to blow the lid off life at the school in a scathing and unforgettable expos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd worthy of the Bennington.<br /><br />The key to the whole story lies with Rafael Amador, the son of the Spanish ambassador\u2014and the boy at the center of the most explosive secrets and scandals on Embassy Row. Rafael is big trouble\u2014and when he drops into her bedroom window one night, asking for help, it\u2019s Piper\u2019s chance to get the full scoop. But as they spend time together, Piper discovers that despite his dark streak, Rafael is smart, kind, funny, and gorgeous\u2014and she might have real feelings for him. How can she break the story of a lifetime if it could destroy the boy she just might love?",
