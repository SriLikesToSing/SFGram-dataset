    "description": "To some passengers a maiden voyage was a pleasure cruise; to others it meant a hope for new life. Only the Captain knew of its danger!<br /><br />The \"Star Lord\" waited, poised for her maiden voyage. The gigantic silvery spindle, still cradled in its scaffoldings, towered upwards against the artificial sky of Satellite Y.<br /><br />The \"Star Lord\" was the perfection of modern space craft, the creation of the earth's most skilled designers and builders, the largest ship ever launched. Protected by every safety device the ingenuity of man had been able to contrive, she was a palace to glide among the stars.<br /><br />She was also doomed, after the fashion of the legendary \"Titanic\" -- and for similar reasons.",
