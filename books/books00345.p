p62
VAnna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister\u2014and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.<br /><br />A provocative novel that raises some important ethical issues, <i>My Sister's Keeper</i> is the story of one family's struggle for survival at all human costs and a stunning parable for all time.

sS'summary'
p83
VShatterday is a collection of short stories by American author Harlan Ellison. In the introduction, Ellison states that the stories reflect an underlying theme of fear of human frailty and ugliness. His goal is to shock his readers into seeing that this fear unifies all people. Each story has an introduction, ranging from a single sentence to several pages long.\u000aAmong the stories in the collection, "Jeffty Is Five" won both a Nebula Award and a Hugo Award. It was also voted in a 1999 online poll of Locus readers to be the best short story of all time. "All the Lies that Are My Life" had been previously published the same year as a novella. The title story was made into the first episode of the 1985 revival of The Twilight Zone. Other stories have been reprinted in omnibus collections such as The Essential Ellison: a 35-Year Retrospective and Dreams With Sharp Teeth.\u000a\u000a
