    "description": "Luis Fuentes is a good boy who doesn't live with the angst that his big brothers, Alex and Carlos, have always lived with. Luis is smart, funny, and has big dreams of becoming an astronaut. But when he falls for the wrong girl, <br /><br />Luis enters a dark world he's never known, and just when he thinks he's got life all figured out, learns some disturbing news about his family that destroys his positive outlook on life. Will that Fuentes bad boy streak come out with a vengeance and lure Luis to live on the edge like his new girlfriend and his own father?<br /><br /><i>Continuing all the steamy romance of the first two books, <b>NY Times</b> and <b>USA Today</b> bestselling author <b>Simone Elkeles</b> gives fans one more satisfying taste of the irresistible Fuentes boys.</i>",
