    "description": "Predictability has come a long way. The computers of the future can tell you if you\u2019re going to win a war before you fire a shot. Unfortunately they\u2019re predicting perpetual standoff between the Terran and Centaurian Empires. What they need is something unpredictable, what they get is Thomas Cole, a man from the past accidently dragged forward in time. Will he fit their calculations, or is he the random variable that can break the stalemate? \u2013 The Variable Man first appeared in the September, 1953 issue of Space Science Fiction magazine.<br /><br />Approx. 3 hours",
