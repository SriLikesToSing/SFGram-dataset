    "description": "Prof. John Munro (1849-1930) was the author of Heroes of the Telegraph (1891), The Story of Electricity (1896) and A Trip to Venus (1897). \"In plain English, at 4 a. m., a ray of light had been observed on the disc of the planet Mars in or near the \"terminator\"; that is to say, the zone of twilight separating day from night. The news was doubly interesting to me, because a singular dream of \"Sunrise in the Moon\" had quickened my imagination as to the wonders of the universe beyond our little globe, and because of a never-to-be-forgotten experience of mine with an aged astronomer several years ago. \"",
