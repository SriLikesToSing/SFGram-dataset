    "description": "Andy Barber has been an assistant district attorney for two decades. He is respected. Admired in the courtroom. Happy at home with the loves of his life, his wife, Laurie, and teenage son, Jacob.<br /><br />Then Andy\u2019s quiet suburb is stunned by a shocking crime: a young boy stabbed to death in a leafy park. And an even greater shock: The accused is Andy\u2019s own son\u2014shy, awkward, mysterious Jacob.<br /><br />Andy believes in Jacob\u2019s innocence. Any parent would. But the pressure mounts. Damning evidence. Doubt. A faltering marriage. The neighbors\u2019 contempt. A murder trial that threatens to obliterate Andy\u2019s family.<br /><br />It is the ultimate test for any parent: How far would you go to protect your child? It is a test of devotion. A test of how well a parent can know a child. For Andy Barber, a man with an iron will and a dark secret, it is a test of guilt and innocence in the deepest sense.<br /><br />How far would <i>you</i> go?<br />",
