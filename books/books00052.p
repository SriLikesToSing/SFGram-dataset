VIn response to a radio plea from Abner Perry, a scientist who with his friend David Innes has discovered the interior world of Pellucidar at the Earth's core, Jason Gridley launches an expedition to rescue Innes from the Korsars (corsairs), the scourge of the internal seas. He enlists Tarzan, and a fabulous airship is constructed to penetrate Pellucidar via the natural polar opening connecting the outer and inner worlds. The airship is crewed primarily by Germans, with Tarzan's Waziri warriors under their chief Muviro also along for the expedition.\u000aIn Pellucidar Tarzan and Gridley are each separated from the main force of the expedition and must struggle for survival against the prehistoric creatures and peoples of the inner world. Gridley wins the love of the native cave-woman Jana, the Red Flower of Zoram. Eventually everyone is reunited, and the party succeeds in rescuing Innes.\u000aAs Tarzan and the others prepare to return home, Gridley decides to stay to search for Frederich Wilhelm Eric von Mendeldorf and von Horst, one last member of the expedition who remains lost (The missing von Horst's adventures are told in a sequel, Back to the Stone Age, which does not involve either Gridley or Tarzan).

VAt the Earth's Core is a 1914 fantasy novel by Burroughs, the 1st in his series about the hollow earth land of Pellucidar. It 1st appeared as a 4-part serial in All-Story Weekly from 4/4-25/14, 1st published as a hardcover by A.C. McClurg in 7/22.<br /> The author relates how, traveling the Sahara, he's encountered a remarkable vehicle &amp; pilot, David Innes, a man with a remarkable story to tell. Innes is a mining heir who finances an experimental "iron mole," an excavating vehicle designed by his elderly inventor friend Abner Perry. In a test, they discover the vehicle cannot be turned. It burrows 500 miles into the Earth, emerging into the unknown interior world of Pellucidar. In Burroughs' concept, Earth is a hollow shell with Pellucidar as the internal surface of that shell. Pellucidar is inhabited by prehistoric creatures of all geological eras, &amp; dominated by the Mahars, a species of flying reptile both intelligent &amp; civilized, but which enslaves &amp; preys on local stone-age humans. Innes &amp; Perry are captured by the Mahars' ape-like Sagoth servants &amp; taken with other human captives to the chief Mahar city of Phutra. Among their fellow captives are the brave Ghak, the Hairy One, from the country of Sari, the shifty Hooja the Sly One &amp; Dian the Beautiful of Amoz. Innes, attracted to Dian the Beautiful, defends her against the unwanted attentions of Hooja, but due to his ignorance of local customs she assumes he wants her as a slave, not friend or lover, &amp; subsequently snubs him. Only later, after Hooja slips their captors in a dark tunnel &amp; forces Dian to leave with him, does David learn from Ghak the cause of the misunderstanding.
