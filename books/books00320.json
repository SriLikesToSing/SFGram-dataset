    "description": "<b>Now a major motion picture from Summit Entertainment.</b><br /><br />R is having a no-life crisis\u2014he is a zombie. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he\u2019d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization.<br /><br />And then he meets a girl.<br /><br />First as his captive, then his reluctant guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R\u2019s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn't want to eat this girl\u2014although she looks delicious\u2014he wants to protect her. But their unlikely bond will cause ripples they can\u2019t imagine, and their hopeless world won\u2019t change without a fight.",
