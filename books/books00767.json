    "description": "There was a sheet of paper on the seat of his aircushion car. He frowned at it. It couldn't have been there before. He picked it up.<br /><br />It was a mimeographed throw-away.<br /><br />It was entitled, \"Freedom,\" and it began: \"Comrades, more than a hundred years ago the founders of scientific socialism, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, explained that the State was incompatible with liberty, that the State was an instrument of repression of one class by another. They explained that for true freedom ever to exist the State must wither away.\"<br /><br />\"Under the leadership of Lenin, Stalin, Krushchev and now Zverev, the State has become ever stronger. Far from withering away, it continues to oppress us. Fellow Russians, it is time we take action! We must. . . .\"",
