But when a rough-and-rugged stranger suddenly pushed her into a hilly cave and pulled her out into the twentieth century, Angela was plenty scared....<br /><br />The present: Texas Ranger Dallas Masterson had a heart full of bitterness, and there was no room in it to care about a smart-mouthed, sassy woman claiming she was from another century! But Angela soon had Dallas discovering that, though his past was history, the future was theirs to make -- together!",
