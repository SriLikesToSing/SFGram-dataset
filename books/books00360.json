    "description": "War isn\u2019t a testament to a man\u2019s strength; finding peace with it is.<br /><br />Navy SEAL Caden Lawless is coming home. Holding his best friend as he bled out in the Afghanistan desert, Caden became bound by Justin\u2019s desperate plea to care for his fianc\u00ef\u00bf\u00bde, and to love the son he\u2019d never know. Battling a barrage of memories and with a head full of noise, Caden travels cross country in his beat up Chevy to make good on his promise.<br /><br />One knock on Piper Stevens\u2019 door and he knows she isn\u2019t broken. Pregnant and mourning the only man she\u2019d ever loved, Piper wields her anger as a sword, slashing into Caden\u2019s grief and his heart. <br /><br />As Caden works to silence his demons, he finds a new mission, one far away from the heat and depravity that clawed its way into his soul. He demands into Piper\u2019s life, intent on helping her pick up the pieces. <br /><br />But even as the tentative fingers of a burgeoning friendship spread into something far deeper than either believed possible, duty calls for Caden to return to the battlefield. Fate brought them together, will war tear them apart? Or, will Caden reclaim the sounds of silence and remain with the woman who taught him love didn\u2019t die in the desert?",
