Happiness is finally on the horizon. She has a thriving business, great friends, and her life back. All she has to do is jump over the last hurdle\u2026her ex-husband. <br /><br />When problems start causing her to fear her new life, and memories that are better left forgotten start rushing to the surface the last thing she needs is a ghost from her past to come knocking on her door. <br /><br />Axel never thought he would look into the eyes of Isabelle West again, and he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to now. He\u2019s carried his anger for so long he isn\u2019t sure he can just turn it off, but when he is faced with protecting her and an unexpected desire to have her again, life gets a little more complicated. <br /><br />How will Axel and Isabelle deal when all their cards are put on the table and everything they thought was true blows up in their faces? <br /><br /><br /><b>\n  <i>Note from the author--This book is intended for a mature reading audience and isn't suitable for younger readers.</i>\n</b>",
