    "description": "This year\u2019s winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition is Davis McCombs\u2019s <i>Ultima Thule, </i>which was acclaimed as \u201ca book of exploration, of searching regard.... a grave, attentive holding of a light\u201d by the contest judge, the distinguished poet W. S. Merwin. The poems are set above and below the Cave Country of south central Kentucky, where McCombs lives and which is home to thousands of caves. The book is framed by two sonnet sequences, the first about a slave guide and explorer at Mammoth Cave in the mid-1800s and the second about McCombs\u2019s experiences as a guide and park ranger there in the 1990s. Other poems deal with Mammoth Cave\u2019s four- thousand-year human history and the thrills of crawling into tight, rarely visited passageways to see what lies beyond. Often the poems search for oblique angles into personal experience, and the caves and the landscape they create form a personal geology.",
