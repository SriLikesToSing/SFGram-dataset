    "description": "THREE AGAINST THE STARS! A sky pirate armed with superior weapons of his own invention...<br /><br />First contact with an alien race dangerous enough to threaten the safety of two planets...<br /><br />The arrival of an unseen dark sun whose attendant marauders aimed at the very end of civilization in this Solar System...<br /><br />These were the three challenges that tested the skill and minds of the brilliant team of scientist-astronauts Arcot, Wade, and Morey. Their initial adventures are a classic of science fiction which first brought the name of their author, John W. Campbell, Jr., into prominence as a master of the inventive imagination -- long before he became the editor of Astounding/Analog and changed the field of science fiction forever!",

    "summary": "The Black Star Passes is a collection of science fiction short stories by American author John W. Campbell, Jr.. It was first published in 1953 by Fantasy Press in an edition of 2,951 copies. The book is the first in Campbell's Arcot, Morey and Wade series. The stories originally appeared in the magazines Amazing Stories and Amazing Stories Quarterly, and were \"extensively edited\" for book publication, with Campbell's approval, by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach.\nGalaxy reviewer Groff Conklin described the stories as \"three creaking classics . . . fun to read, [but] rococo antiques [without] believable characters, human relations, even logical plots.\" Boucher and McComas dismissed the book as \"a hopelessly outdated set of novelets . . . of concern only to those who wish to observe the awkward larval stage of a major figure in science fiction.\" P. Schuyler Miller described the stories as \"old-fashioned fun which [Campbell] no longer takes any more seriously than you need to.\"",
