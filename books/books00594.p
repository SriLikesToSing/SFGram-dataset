VThe story takes place in the fictional town of Milburn, New York, and is told from the alternating points of view of five men in their old age. The protagonists, lifelong friends who call themselves the "Chowder Society," gather periodically to reminisce and share ghost stories. When one of them dies suddenly, the surviving men find themselves haunted by dreams in which they also die. As the story unfolds, their past is revealed to hold a murder from their youth, and they begin to fear that the young woman they killed has returned to take revenge upon them.

p69
VIn this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?<br /><br />His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.
