    "summary": "It is a 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King. It was his 22nd book and 18th novel written under his own name. The story follows the experiences of seven children as they are terrorized by a being, which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey. \"It\" primarily appears in the form of a clown in order to attract its preferred prey of young children.\nThe novel is told through narratives alternating between two time periods, and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode. It deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood, the ugliness lurking behind a fa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdade of small-town quaintness, and overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice. The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same year. Publishers Weekly listed It as the best-selling book in the United States in 1986.",
