    "description": "When five female astronauts were named to pilot the latest interstellar scout ship, the U.S.S. Letanya, it didn\u2019t take long for the wags to dub it the \u201cLesbianya.\u201d Even in 2075, an all-woman crew was met with snickers and jokes by late-night comedians.<br /><br />Capt. Kathryn Dyson was out to prove them wrong. When the crew discovered a strange new world with humanoid life long before any male explorers did, it seemed NASA\u2019s shaky faith in the mission would be justified.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some of the crew got themselves captured and turned into slaves by the huge man-like beings on the planet. Now it\u2019s up to Kate Dyson to rescue her crew or die trying, because she\u2019s not going back without them, despite NASA\u2019s orders. Failure might find her becoming just another sex object on\u2026<br /><br />\"This is a fantastic, sexy tale filled with strong women who know that they want and are not afraid to take it. In the spirit of Johanna Lindsey's 'Warrior's Woman' and Gene Roddenberry's 'Star Trek, ' J.W. McKenna creates a] futuristic world and fills it with action and eroticism.\" - Amy L.
