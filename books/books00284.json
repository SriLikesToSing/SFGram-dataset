    "description": "Anax thinks she knows history. Her grueling all-day Examination has just begun, and if she passes, she\u2019ll be admitted into the Academy\u2014the elite governing institution of her utopian society. But Anax is about to discover that for all her learning, the history she\u2019s been taught isn\u2019t the whole story. And the Academy isn\u2019t what she believes it to be. In this brilliant novel of dazzling ingenuity, Anax\u2019s examination leads us into a future where we are confronted with unresolved questions raised by science and philosophy. Centuries old, these questions have gained new urgency in the face of rapidly developing technology. What is consciousness? What makes us human? If artificial intelligence were developed to a high enough capability, what special status could humanity still claim? Outstanding and original, Beckett\u2019s dramatic narrative comes to a shocking conclusion.",
