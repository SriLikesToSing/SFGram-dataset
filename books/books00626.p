VAce Double D-96, printed with "The Last Planet" by Andre Norton<br /><br />HE HUNTED HORROR THROUGH A MANIAC WORLD!<br /><br />Jeffrey Meyer had a killing on his mind. It meant nothing to him that his towering Twenty-first Century world was going mad. He shouldered aside the rising tide of narcotics-mania, the gambling fever, the insatiable lust for the irrational. Jeff had his own all-consuming obsession\u2014Paul Conroe must die!<br /><br />After a five-year frenzied chase, Jeff had his victim cornered; he'd driven him into the last hideaway of the world's most desperate men\u2014the sealed vaults of the human-vivisectionists. And Jeff knew that to reach his final horrible objective, he must offer himself also as a guinea pig for the secret experiments of the world's most feared physicians!<br /><br />Alan E. Nourse's new novel A MAN OBSESSED has the impact of Orwell's <i>1984</i> and the imaginative vigor of Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i>.
