    "description": "Nina Christie was warned, but Hazy Duncan is even worse than she expected. <br /><br />Nina\u2019s new home on Chincoteague Island would be perfect but for the blight of Hazy\u2019s perpetual rudeness. The island\u2019s other inhabitants welcome her back as a prodigal daughter of the community and the idyllic summer breezes soothe her wounded heart. All she wants is peace, quiet and her books. Hazy\u2019s experience with beautiful women like Nina is that they\u2019re easily bored and always looking for something better. Just when CC is finally out of Hazy's life and she can hear the heartbeat of the ocean again, here was another beautiful woman on her doorstep. Nina is even more dangerous than CC because Nina is nice. <br /><br />With both Nina and Hazy suspicious of anything that might be romance, it\u2019s surprising when their hearts\u2014and the enchantment of the island\u2014seem to have other plans for them. <br /><br />Newcomer Nat Burns weaves a classic story of summer love set on the beautiful Delmarva Peninsula and the Chesapeake Bay.",
