    "description": "Marie doesn\u2019t need a complication like Horse. The massive, tattooed, badass biker who shows up at her brother\u2019s house one afternoon doesn\u2019t agree. He wants Marie on his bike and in his bed. Now.<br /><br />But Marie just left her abusive jerk of an ex-husband and she\u2019s not looking for a new man. Especially one like Horse\u2014she doesn\u2019t know his real name or where he lives, she\u2019s ninety percent certain he\u2019s a criminal and that the \u201cbusiness\u201d he talks with her brother isn\u2019t website design. She needs him out of her life, which would be a snap if he\u2019d just stop giving her mind-blowing orgasms.<br /><br />Horse is part of the Reapers Motorcycle Club, and when he wants something, he takes it. What he wants is Marie, but she\u2019s not interested in becoming \u201cproperty of\u201d.<br /><br />Then her brother steals from the club. Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants\u2014at home, in public, on his bike\u2026 If she\u2019s a very, very good girl, she\u2019ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he\u2019ll let her brother live.<br />Maybe.",
