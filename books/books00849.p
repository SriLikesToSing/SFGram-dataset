V<i>It was just a nightmare.<br /><br />All Ricky needed to do was wake up. Just open his eyes. And Kony\u2019s red-eyed beasts with their long claws dripping blood and their fiery breath would have disappeared. His brother would be beside him. His parents and sisters would be safe and asleep in their beds.<br /><br />Just like before.</i><br /><br />Here is the true story of Ricky Richard Anywar, abducted in 1989 at age fourteen by Joseph Kony\u2019s rebel army in the Ugandan civil war (one of Africa\u2019s longest-running conflicts). Ricky is trained, armed, and sent to battle government troops alongside his brutal kidnappers, but over his two and a half years of enslavement, he never stops dreaming of escape.<br /><br />Here also is the story, set twenty years later, of a fictional character named Samuel, a boy deathly afraid of trusting anyone ever again, and representative of the thousands of child soldiers Ricky has helped rehabilitate as founder of the internationally acclaimed charity Friends of Orphans.
