    "description": "\"For some forty years critics of the U.S.S.R. have been desiring, predicting, not to mention praying for, its collapse,\" says Mack Reynolds in this story's preface. \"For twenty of these years the author of this story has vaguely wondered what would replace the collapsed Soviet system. A return to Czarism? Oh, come now! Capitalism as we know it today in the advanced Western countries?\" \"Oh, if he'd only seen!, \" we find ourselves thinking. Still, Reynolds has seen something, and he has a lot to say about it. See for yourself!",
