    "description": "The Green Odyssey has been called \"rollicking science-fiction adventure,\" \"uproarious,\" \"swashbuckling,\" and \"sheer fun,\" and described by science-fiction critic Sam Moskowitz as \"filled with engaging humor.\" The adventure begins when Alan Green arranges passage on a \"wind roller,\" a sailing vessel of the plains, by dazzling the captain with a financial scheme that offers rich profits to overcome his reluctance to help a fugitive. Setting \"sale\" with the captain, Green thinks he's escaped from his dominating wife--but he's wrong. Throw in pirates, floating islands, and a black cat-goddess with a taste for beer, picked up after shipwreck on one of the wandering Islands of the Xurdimur, and you have the recipe for science-fantasy adventure as irresistible as Riverworld itself. Newly designed and typeset in a modern 6-by-9-inch format by Waking Lion Press.",
