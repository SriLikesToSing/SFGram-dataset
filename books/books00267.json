    "description": "\"I've done it,\" McIlvaine said quietly. \"What's that?\" asked Alexander testily. \"I discovered a new star. It lies just off Arcturus,\" McIlvaine went on, \"and it would appear to be coming closer.\" \"Give it my love,\" said Richardson with a wry smile. \"Have you named it yet? Or don't the discoverers of new stars name them any more? McIlvaine's Star -- that's a good name for it. Hard a port of Arcturus, with special displays on windy nights.\" What Thaddeus McIlvaine and Alexander Richardson didn't realize was that they were characters in a horror story. A story written by August Derleth, the man who founded Arkham House. None of these folks knew it yet, but they're all DOOMED! Doomed! Mwahahahaha!",
